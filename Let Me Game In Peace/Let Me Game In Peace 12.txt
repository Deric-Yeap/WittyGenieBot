<h3 id='chapter1100'>Chapter 1100: Sealing Companion Beasts</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>When the blood landed in the air, it turned into specks of sanguine light that dissipated. The blood could no longer be seen with the naked eye, but the entire arena seemed to be covered in a faint sanguine light.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his palm and a red glow appeared on the blue crystal bracer. It was faint and inconspicuous.</p>
<p>After summoning Night Immaculate Sword, he realized that his mental connection with it had weakened significantly. This made Zhou Wen understand that Blood Shaman’s blood sacrifice technique was the power to seal Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Even on his ear, Truth Listener’s connection with Zhou Wen weakened significantly. From the looks of it, Evil Nullification couldn’t restrain this sealing power.</p>
<p>The Heaven-Opening Scripture had long been engraved, but it didn’t appear to be of much use.</p>
<p>Even the Heaven-Opening Scripture and Evil Nullification can’t restrain it. It’s neither a taboo rule nor a curse. What kind of power is this? Zhou Wen thought to himself, but he didn’t stop. He planned on summoning the Companion Beasts that had previously fought.</p>
<p>Everyone watched excitedly as Companion Beasts appeared, believing that they could see another grand battle of Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had only summoned a few Companion Beasts without even summoning all six Demon Blood True Dragons before he saw a sanguine glow emit from the Blood Shaman’s eyes, turning the entire arena red.</p>
<p>The Companion Beasts that Zhou Wen had summoned suddenly flew back to him and returned to their tattoo form. Truth Listener was no exception.</p>
<p>“What happened? Why did he unsummon his Companion Beasts?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t look like it was done of his own accord. It seems to have been sent back by the power of Blood Shaman.”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me the power of Blood Shaman prevents people from summoning Companion Beasts? If that’s the case, Human will be in danger.”</p>
<p>“It looks like it. That beautiful fairy-like Companion Beast didn’t appear either.”</p>
<p>“Even a Terror-grade Companion Beast can be sealed? Isn’t that too much of a sham? Without a Companion Beast, how can we humans fight?”</p>
<p>“Blood Shaman’s ability is basically targeted at us humans. In front of him, all humans will be unable to withstand a single blow. It’s really terrifying.”</p>
<p>“If he can’t use Companion Beasts, will Human still have a chance of defeating Blood Shaman?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid it will be very difficult. Unless he has the same combat ability as Ya.”</p>
<p>Everyone discussed spiritedly. Zhou Wen also attempted to summon Banana Fairy, but unfortunately, she was also sealed by Blood Shaman’s power and couldn’t be summoned.</p>
<p>The power of Blood Shaman is definitely a great enemy of humanity, Zhou Wen thought as he looked at Blood Shaman.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen also realized that Blood Shaman’s power wasn’t only targeted at him. Even he couldn’t summon his Companion Beasts, nor did he have any equipment transformed from them. Clearly, even he was limited by this power and couldn’t use Companion Beasts either.</p>
<p>Blood Shaman stood in the blood-colored light. The armor on his body emitted a strong bloody smell like a bloodthirsty god.</p>
<p>“Forget your futile attempts. In the blood sacrifice ritual, no Companion Beast can be summoned. Even I can’t.” Blood Shaman looked at Zhou Wen and continued, “There’s still time to withdraw.”</p>
<p>With Blood Shaman admitting it personally, everyone knew that their previous guess was right. Blood Shaman’s ability was simply the natural enemy of humans.</p>
<p>“There’s actually such power. Isn’t this too ridiculous? With such power, how can humans live in the future?”</p>
<p>“Such power is too unfair to humans.”</p>
<p>“Child, you are still too naive. There’s nothing fair in this world.”</p>
<p>“Human’s really in danger this time. He can’t use Companion Beasts. His combat strength has been greatly weakened.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Blood Shaman and said calmly, “I’ll naturally withdraw when I’m about to die.”</p>
<p>Blood Shaman didn’t say anything else. However, the sanguine light on his body became stronger and stronger. It turned into blood-colored flames that enveloped his entire body like a blood shadow.</p>
<p>Terror-grade? Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised when he saw the change in Blood Shaman’s strength.</p>
<p>He wasn’t surprised that Blood Shaman was at the Terror grade. It would be strange if it wasn’t at the Terror grade if he could seal even Banana Fairy.</p>
<p>To his surprise, although Blood Shaman had turned into his Terror form, his body didn’t completely disappear. The average person could still see his figure.</p>
<p>Only some special Terror transformations would have such an effect. For example, the gigantification of Jade Rabbit.</p>
<p>“This is your last chance to live. If I attack, I won’t show any mercy.” Blood Shaman floated in the air like a divine blood shadow, illuminating the entire arena with blood-red light.</p>
<p>Wang Lu held her hands together in worry. Although Zhou Wen was very strong, how could he fight the Terror-grade Blood Shaman without the help of his Companion Beasts?</p>
<p>Others believed that Zhou Wen was a human who had fused with a Guardian, but Wang Lu and company knew very well that Zhou Wen hadn’t fused with a Guardian.</p>
<p>When they had parted, Zhou Wen was only at the Epic stage.</p>
<p>Although they didn’t know what method Zhou Wen had used to get on the rankings, it was already impressive that he had advanced to the Mythical stage. It was impossible for him to advance to the Terror grade in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>Many of the spectators were equally worried.</p>
<p>“Since you are standing here, you are an enemy. Why are we talking about mercy?” Zhou Wen said indifferently. He was determined to defeat all humans with Guardians. Unless he was at his wits’ end, he definitely wouldn’t give up easily.</p>
<p>“That’s right. I was wrong.” With that said, the anthropomorphic blood shadow charged at Zhou Wen and slashed down like a blade.</p>
<p>His speed was so fast that ordinary humans couldn’t keep up with him. Even though he didn’t disappear after his Terror transformation, ordinary people couldn’t see his actions.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen could clearly see that although Blood Shaman was very fast, it wasn’t much faster than a top Mythical creature. Its speed couldn’t even compare to some top Speed-type Mythical creatures.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that this meant that Blood Shaman’s stats weren’t very high. Perhaps, just like Banana Fairy, he had just slightly exceeded 82, so he wasn’t at a disadvantage in terms of stats.</p>
<p>His Speed attribute had already broken past 70.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t underestimate Blood Shaman because of this. The other party’s Terror form definitely had its benefits. Although their stats were similar, he couldn’t treat him as a Mythical creature.</p>
<p>With a wave of his hand, a white wooden club appeared in his hand.</p>
<p>This wooden club wasn’t transformed from a Companion Beast. It was something Zhou Wen had picked up from the mountain god who had sacrificed the white deer and condensed the Blood Oxypetalum.</p>
<p>Apart from the white wooden club, there was also a metal disc that resembled a gong.</p>
<p>There was no way to use a Companion Beast now, and Bamboo Blade was too eye-catching. Others would recognize him at a glance, so he had no choice but to use these.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>After condensing his forces, Zhou Wen used the white wooden club as a sword and charged at Blood Shaman with an intense sword aura. He wanted to see how strong a Terror-grade creature like Blood Shaman was.</p>
<p>Dressed in Absolute Defense armor, Zhou Wen didn’t need to worry that Blood Shaman could instantly kill him.</p>

<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The tip of the wooden club collided with Blood Shaman’s saber. Zhou Wen immediately felt an immense force strike him as he was sent flying along with the club.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen was in midair, he had already used borrowed force to dissipate the enemy force. He was like an immortal that flew backward in the wind. When he landed, the force was completely deflected.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen roughly knew that Blood Shaman’s strength was indeed stronger than his, but it wasn’t much stronger. It was probably around eighty.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen still didn’t understand what the ability obtained after Blood Shaman’s Terror transformation was.</p>
<p>Only a Terror-grade power could kill a Terror-grade, but the Terror transformation of Blood Shaman wasn’t as powerful as he imagined.</p>
<p>Blood Shaman sized up the wooden club in Zhou Wen’s hand as though he was puzzled.</p>
<p>He blocked it! The spectators felt mixed emotions when they saw Zhou Wen block Blood Shaman’s strike. Although he was at a disadvantage, he wasn’t severely injured.</p>
<p>It was undoubtedly a good thing that Human could fight Blood Shaman, but this also indirectly proved that Human couldn’t be a pure human. This was because it was impossible for a pure human to advance to the Mythical stage, much less fight a Terror-grade Guardian. This greatly disappointed many people who originally had fantasies that Human might be pure human.</p>
<p>Although half-humans could be considered humans, people ultimately couldn’t give up their prejudice. They yearned for pure humans to step onto the stage and compete with dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>“Is he really not pure human?” Li Benyi couldn’t hide the disappointment on his face.</p>
<p>“It looks like I’m overthinking it. How can a pure human be on the rankings?” Xia Liuchuan was somewhat disappointed. He really hoped that Human was pure human.</p>
<p>There were many people like them, and they couldn’t hide the disappointment on their faces.</p>
<p>In the arena, Zhou Wen used his sword art to fight Blood Shaman. His sword art was all-encompassing and compatible with three thousand sword intents. He could use any one of them to fight Blood Shaman. As long as he didn’t switch intents randomly, it would be difficult for anyone to recognize him as Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s surprise, Blood Shaman seemed much weaker than he imagined. It didn’t have the suppression that a Terror-grade should have.</p>
<p>Blood Shaman was faster and stronger than him, but the difference was limited. As for what abilities his Terror state had, Zhou Wen had yet to discover them.</p>
<p>As for combat strength and techniques, although Blood Shaman was very strong, Zhou Wen wasn’t weaker than him. As such, Blood Shaman failed to showcase the horror of the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Could it be that Blood Shaman’s Terror transformation ability is only to seal Companion Beasts? Zhou Wen wondered.</p>
<p>After all, being able to seal all Companion Beasts was a very transformative ability. However, Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that Blood Shaman’s Terror transformation’s abilities weren’t limited to that.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen realized the problem.</p>
<p>This was because during the battle, Blood Shaman seemed to pay special attention to the white wooden club in his hand. He couldn’t help but think to himself, Could it be that the reason why Blood Shaman hasn’t unleashed his abilities is related to this wooden club?</p>
<p>Is this wooden club that powerful? Its owner didn’t seem that strong. It didn’t take Truth Listener much effort to kill it back then. Zhou Wen felt that it was somewhat unlikely, but other than that, he couldn’t figure out why Blood Shaman couldn’t produce the combat strength that a Terror-grade should have.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hadn’t taken the initiative to attack Blood Shaman because he knew that only a Terror-grade power could injure a Terror-grade. Therefore, he thought that it was useless even if he attacked. All he did was block.</p>
<p>However, after having other thoughts, he immediately switched from defense to offense. He used the Heart Defying Sword and thrust his attacks at Blood Shaman’s vital spots.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s surprise, Blood Shaman really began dodging, not daring to let the white wooden club injure his body.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, Blood Shaman is really afraid of this wooden club! Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised. He never expected the item he had casually stored away to be so useful. Furthermore, he couldn’t tell what was so special about the wooden club.</p>
<p>What’s this wooden club? And that metal disc. Could they be something good? Zhou Wen thought greedily.</p>
<p>With this turn of events, Zhou Wen’s attacks became even more ferocious. With the deterrence of the white wooden club, he forcefully suppressed Blood Shaman. Blood Shaman slowly began to retreat.</p>
<p>“Is that Blood Shaman at the Terror grade? It looks very weak?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that Blood Shaman is weak, but that Human is too strong. That sword art is simply godlike.”</p>
<p>“But his body looks very normal. He doesn’t look as strange as those creatures in their Terror form. Is he at the Terror grade?”</p>
<p>“He’s definitely at the Terror grade. Otherwise, how can he suppress the Terror-grade Blood Shaman?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. According to my experience, those Terror-grade bodies will have obvious changes. They might even become invisible to us, but Human remains of flesh and blood. He is still wearing ordinary clothes. From this point of view, he shouldn’t have used the power of the Terror-grade. It’s even possible that he’s not at the Terror-grade at all.”</p>
<p>“If he’s not a Terror-grade entity, how can he suppress Blood Shaman? Are you reading too much into it?”</p>
<p>People were divided into two factions. One faction felt that Human wasn’t at the Terror grade, while the other felt that Human was at the Terror grade. Even among the six families, many people had opposing views.</p>
<p>The battle hadn’t even ended, but the media had already started a war of words.</p>
<p>“Human is definitely not at the Terror grade.”</p>
<p>“How can he suppress the Terror-grade Blood Shaman if he’s not at the Terror grade?”</p>
<p>“Our Human is just strong. As a Mythical, he can defeat a Terror-grade creature. Can’t you just accept it?”</p>
<p>“ZZ, have you ever seen a Mythical creature fight a Terror-grade? Even Ya can only fight Jiuyue after breaking through to the Terror grade. Please wake up and stop fantasizing.”</p>
<p>“Ya is Ya, and Human is Human. Ya can’t fight the Terror grade at the Mythical stage, but Human can.”</p>
<p>As the two factions were embroiled in a heated argument, someone weakly said, “Could Human really be pure human? Without a Companion Beast, he’s only wearing human clothes and an ordinary helmet. He doesn’t seem to be a half-human like Ya.”</p>
<p>Such a suggestion was quickly denounced by the two factions.</p>
<p>“Do you have any common sense? It’s impossible for humans to break through to the Mythical stage by themselves.”</p>
<p>“Brother, although I also hope that Human is pure human, it seems impossible from what we know.”</p>
<p>In an ancient temple on a plateau, Jing Daoxian looked at the white wooden club in Zhou Wen’s hand and frowned as though he was thinking about something. After a while, he muttered to himself, “That wooden club… Could it be the Mourning Stick of the Impermanence ghosts… Where did this punk get it from…”</p>

<p>Celestial Gods… Di Tian’s palace…</p>
<p>An enchanting woman looked at the battle in the cube as her beautiful face revealed a look of surprise. “What’s that wooden club? It can actually withstand Blood Shaman’s Blood Thinning powers?”</p>
<p>Di Tian said indifferently, “It’s a Terror item of the extreme Yin attribute. Furthermore, it has reached the level of a physical weapon. How can such a level of Blood Thinning power injure it? If that thing was in the hands of its true owner, Blood Shaman would already be dead.”</p>
<p>“In that case, it’s impossible for Blood Shaman to win. Then, we can only hope that the kings of the various races can reach an agreement and kick that person out,” the woman said.</p>
<p>“There’s no need for that. Although Blood Shaman no longer has a chance, it has given us an important piece of information,” Di Tian said slowly.</p>
<p>“What important information?” The woman was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>“Although I don’t know what Guardian that person has fused with, I can now confirm that he hasn’t reached the Terror grade. All he can rely on is that Terror-grade Companion Beast and the corporeal Terror weapon in his hand. As long as one can resolve these two things, he won’t be able to withstand a single blow from the Terror grade,” Di Tian said casually.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid it won’t be easy, right? His Companion Beast in her Terror form is too powerful. Typical Terror-grade creatures aren’t her match at all. Which Guardian would be her match if that Companion Beast could be summoned? However, Blood Shaman is afraid of that wooden club. There’s no chance of winning,” the woman said.</p>
<p>“Since there’s no chance for a single Blood Shaman, add a few more to the lineup.” Di Tian slowly stood up.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, it doesn’t seem appropriate to change the rules of the cube without the approval of the various races, right?” The woman immediately understood what Di Tian was trying to do.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to change the rules. As the host of this cube battle, I still have this tiny bit of authority.” As Di Tian spoke, he took a step forward and passed through space, heading towards the cube.</p>
<p>As everyone watched in excitement, Zhou Wen constantly attacked while Blood Shaman retreated in defeat. However, when they suddenly saw a distorted light descend from the void, their hearts skipped a beat.</p>
<p>Indeed, the distorted shadow that had appeared a few times previously appeared above the cube’s arena again.</p>
<p>“What does he want again?”</p>
<p>“Could it be that he wants to change the rules because they can’t beat us again?”</p>
<p>“What else do they know other than changing the rules?”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you just kick Human out? You’ve already done it once anyway.”</p>
<p>“People can’t be so shameless.”</p>
<p>“People naturally can’t be so shameless. Unfortunately, they aren’t humans.”</p>
<p>“They are beasts.”</p>
<p>The spectators were angry and frustrated as they mocked loudly. Unfortunately, it was useless. Their voices couldn’t reach the cube, so Di Tian couldn’t hear them. Even if he could hear them, he wouldn’t care. He would only smack them to death with a swat.</p>
<p>Di Tian looked down at the arena and spoke like a god who ruled over everything. “In order to quickly determine first place, the top ten creatures on the rankings can immediately enter the arena to fight. The loser will be immediately eliminated. The rules from before remain unchanged. Every creature only has one chance to issue a challenge.”</p>
<p>After speaking, Di Tian tore through the air and returned to the palace of the Celestial Gods.</p>
<p>After everyone heard that, they subconsciously looked at the rankings and immediately cursed.</p>
<p>“F*ck you. Apart from Human in the top ten, the rest are Guardians. Isn’t letting them in merely to have them gank Human?”</p>
<p>“Shameless.” The Zhang family’s hot-tempered eldest uncle cursed out loud.</p>
<p>“Do they have any shame?”</p>
<p>Everyone was extremely furious. They wished they could spit at them and drown the creatures of the dimension.</p>
<p>However, despite cursing, several Guardians in the top ten had already entered the arena. In just a moment, eight Guardians in the top ten had arrived.</p>
<p>There was only one Guardian in the top ten who didn’t participate.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>On an island overseas, a cultured young man was about to board the cube when he suddenly retreated.</p>
<p>A figure appeared where the young man had stood as though he had teleported. It was none other than the Terror-grade Guardian, Cave Era.</p>
<p>“You’d better stay behind and not go anywhere,” said Cave Era as she looked at the young man.</p>
<p>“Why?” The young man wasn’t angry as he asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“Because you can’t go on stage,” said Cave Era.</p>
<p>“I’m also in the top ten. Why can’t I go on stage?” the young man asked again.</p>
<p>“Do you want to kill that Human after you go on stage, or do you want to help him?” Cave Era asked.</p>
<p>“Help him,” the young man answered.</p>
<p>“That’s why you can’t go on stage.”</p>
<p>“What if I have to go?” The smile on the young man’s face vanished as he became serious.</p>
<p>“Defeat me and you can go,” Cave Era said.</p>
<p>The young man suddenly laughed. “Sis, stop joking. Your Guardian is already at the Terror grade, but my Guardian hasn’t advanced to the Terror grade. How can I defeat you?”</p>
<p>“Then stay here obediently and be a spectator,” said Cave Era.</p>
<p>“Alright.” The young man walked towards Cave Era, but his eyes were on the cube’s screen. “Sis, do you think that person has a chance of defeating the ganking of those Guardians?”</p>
<p>“There’s no chance…” Before Cave Era could say anything, the young man suddenly attacked. He pressed a hand on Cave Era’s shoulder and a flower vine wrapped around her body, instantly wrapping her up like a mummy.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of this moment, the young man rushed towards the cube, wanting to enter the cube’s arena.</p>
<p>However, just as he rushed to the cube, he saw Cave Era standing on it.</p>
<p>“You can go if you want, but defeat me first,” Cave Era said coldly as she looked at the young man.</p>
<p>“Sis, must we do this?” The young man sighed.</p>
<p>“Defeat me or watch the battle here,” said Cave Era expressionlessly.</p>
<p>The young man stared at Cave Era. The gentleness on his face had vanished. He softly spat out two words. “Fairy… Burial…”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Petals surged out of his body and gradually condensed into a floral armor that enveloped his slender body.</p>
<p>In the arena, the eight Guardians had already surrounded Zhou Wen from different directions. There were Guardians blocking his path in every single direction.</p>
<p>Their goal was very clear. Just as people had guessed, they had no intention of engaging in a free-for-all battle. Their only target was Human.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they had already obtained the news from the dimension. They knew that Human wasn’t at the Terror grade at all. He was only at the Mythical stage. They had already guessed this from Zhou Wen’s battle with Blood Shaman.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1103'>Chapter 1103: Mythical Immortal Slaying</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the Guardians and was surprisingly calm.</p>
<p>Apart from Zhou Wen himself, there were a total of nine Guardians in the top ten and Blood Shaman wasn’t among them. Zhou Wen only recognized two of them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen Night Thearch, Cave Era, Jiuyue, and Great Skyfiend before. The stronger Guardians weren’t in the top ten.</p>
<p>The two Guardians Zhou Wen knew were Grim Demon and Fairy Burial, but among the eight Guardians in the arena, he didn’t see them.</p>
<p>Strange; even if Grim Demon and Fairy Burial are held back and can’t enter the arena, there should be seven Guardians in the arena. Why are there eight? Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to think about who the additional person was because the eight Guardians had already surrounded him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was at the Mythical stage and couldn’t use Companion Beasts. The only reason he could suppress Blood Shaman was because of the white wooden club in his hand.</p>
<p>Now that the eight Guardians had surrounded him, Zhou Wen felt the pressure. Even Zhou Wen was overwhelmed by the eight different powers and skills.</p>
<p>Guardians that could enter the top ten naturally had their specialties. None of them were weak. If he encountered them normally, it wouldn’t be difficult for Zhou Wen to deal with them using various Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>However, now that his Companion Beasts were restricted and he was kept busy by Blood Shaman, he didn’t have the spare energy to deal with them.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, there’s only one way. Zhou Wen looked at Blood Shaman and knew that his only chance was to kill it. As long as he killed it, he could use his Companion Beasts. The eight Mythical Guardians would then be nothing to him.</p>
<p>However, it was extremely difficult to kill the Terror-grade Blood Shaman under the siege of eight Guardians.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can’t use creatures other than Companion Beasts and Guardians on the cube. Otherwise, how difficult would it be to kill Blood Shaman if I summoned Jade Rabbit and Ice Maiden? Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>The humans watching naturally saw Zhou Wen’s predicament.</p>
<p>His sword art and movement techniques were stunning. While fighting Blood Shaman, he could still remain undefeated despite the siege of eight Guardians.</p>
<p>However, everyone could tell that it was impossible for Human to persist. The pressure Blood Shaman gave him was too great, so he didn’t have the excess strength to kill the other Guardians.</p>
<p>“This sword art and movement technique are too powerful. It definitely doesn’t belong to humans.”</p>
<p>“Even if he’s a half-human, he still has human blood flowing in him. As long as he treats himself as a human, he’s a human.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. He’s human to begin with. Ya is the same. So what if he fused with a Guardian? As long as he identifies as human, he’s human.”</p>
<p>“His determination is obvious from using ‘Human’ as his name.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was able to remain undefeated despite fighting nine alone. His god-like sword art and movement techniques were shocking. It also made most of the audience’s acknowledgment of him intensify. They even began to ignore the fact that he might be a half-human.</p>
<p>However, everyone also knew that no matter how strong Zhou Wen’s sword art and movement techniques were, that was all. If this continued, he would only be defeated.</p>
<p>The stronger Zhou Wen’s performance was, the more regretful the outcome would be.</p>
<p>“Ya is like this, and so is Human. Are we humans destined to be toyed with by the dimension?”</p>
<p>Anger and indignation gradually rose in everyone’s hearts. They yearned to rush into the arena and fight alongside Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, there was nothing they could do. All they could do was watch as Zhou Wen was besieged. They had nowhere to vent their anger.</p>
<p>It wasn’t only pity for Zhou Wen, but also hatred for their own incompetence. At the same time, it was indignation and shame at having their fates controlled.</p>
<p>They could fully empathize with Zhou Wen’s predicament. The humiliation made them feel terrible.</p>
<p>“Why can’t humans become the King of Earth? We are the masters of Earth.” Anger and humiliation intertwined in their hearts. Instantly, the spectators fell silent. No one said a word as they quietly watched Zhou Wen being attacked by the Guardians, waiting for the outcome they didn’t wish to see.</p>
<p>Seeing that Human’s situation was worsening, more and more people fell silent. In front of the countless cubes on Earth, most of them were silent.</p>
<p>Even the media streamers who did live-stream analysis spoke less. They almost stopped interpreting the current situation.</p>
<p>This was because even if they didn’t provide an interpretation, they could tell from the slow-motion camera that Human was in a dire situation. Defeat was only a matter of time.</p>
<p>“This silence isn’t bad. Low-grade creatures should be reserved,” the woman beside Di Tian said with a smile.</p>
<p>Di Tian said indifferently, “From the looks of it, the silence will continue.”</p>
<p>The situation was becoming more and more disadvantageous for Zhou Wen. He had already used his movement techniques and sword art to their limits, but it was still difficult for him to gain the upper hand in the siege.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already made up his mind. He gripped the white wooden stick in his hand tightly and circulated Slaughterer Life Soul.</p>
<p>This was the only Life Soul he could use without carving it. It was also the power he needed to use Immortal Slaying.</p>
<p>However, ever since Zhou Wen advanced to the Mythical stage, he hadn’t used Immortal Slaying. He only knew that as his Life Soul grew and his stats increased, Immortal Slaying’s might should be much stronger than before.</p>
<p>Yet, Zhou Wen wasn’t sure how much status Immortal Slaying had grown and if he could kill Blood Shaman under the siege of the Guardians.</p>
<p>However, at this stage, he could only give it a shot. If he didn’t succeed, he would have to admit defeat and leave the arena.</p>
<p>As Slaughterer’s power fused with Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen immediately felt a strange power infuse into his body, making his entire body feel like it was about to sublimate.</p>
<p>This feeling was somewhat different from when he had used Slaughterer in the past. In the past, Slaughterer seemed to hug him, pushing his body to erupt with power.</p>
<p>Although it could give Zhou Wen immense strength, he felt a little estranged.</p>
<p>Now, Slaughterer’s strength had perfectly fused with his body. There was no barrier between them, allowing Zhou Wen to deeply sense Slaughterer’s strength.</p>
<p>No, it should be said that the power seemed to be a part of Zhou Wen’s body. It was no different from his own strength. Even though he had never used the Mythical Slaughterer, the moment the power entered his body, it had already fused with Zhou Wen’s own strength.</p>
<p>The white wooden club in Zhou Wen’s hand was still a wooden club without any blade, but it suddenly gave off an indomitable and strange feeling.</p>
<p>Blood Shaman and the eight Mythical Guardians felt their hearts palpitate as though they had sensed something.</p>
<p>However, before they could react, Zhou Wen had already brandished the white wooden club in his hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s swing didn’t seem fast. Ignoring a Terror-grade expert and Mythical Guardian like Blood Shaman, even ordinary humans could see it clearly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1104'>Chapter 1104: Kicking Again</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Everyone saw this strike clearly. Even the media broadcast didn’t need to use slow-motion replays to see it clearly.</p>
<p>However, this didn’t mean that the strike wasn’t fast. On the contrary, not only was it fast, but it also gave off that indomitable and unyielding feeling.</p>
<p>Elegance was the word to describe the beauty of its gentleness, while unyielding described the beauty of masculinity. These were two extremes that shouldn’t have been used to describe the same thing at the same time.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s strike had perfectly fused the two opposing beauties into one. It gave off an elegant yet sharp feeling.</p>
<p>What was even stranger was that everyone saw the slash clearly. Blood Shaman and the eight Guardians also saw it clearly.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, they saw all the minute movements of this move, but their bodies didn’t seem to obey their orders. They watched helplessly as the white wooden club slashed at their necks, but their bodies couldn’t react or do anything.</p>
<p>Seven heads were beheaded almost at the same time. Only Blood Shaman’s body emitted a sanguine glow as blood spewed out from his body. He transformed into a blood shadow and flew away, instantly admitting defeat and leaving the arena.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>The originally noisy arena immediately fell silent, leaving only the sounds of the heads and corpses of the seven Mythical Guardians falling to the ground.</p>
<p>And in front of the cubes around the world, it was even quieter than the arena.</p>
<p>Everyone’s expressions changed from shock to pleasant surprise, then to wild joy. After a moment of silence, cheers resounded into the sky.</p>
<p>“He’s so powerful… He killed seven Guardians ranked in the top ten in one strike and even severely injured the Terror-grade Blood Shaman, forcing it to admit defeat. This is too sick…”</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen such a terrifying move. When I saw that slash, I thought I would be sliced into two.”</p>
<p>“If a divine technique can even make a Terror-grade Guardian flee, who can match it? First place will definitely be Human’s.”</p>
<p>“In theory, Human’s definitely number one, but who knows what other cheap tricks those b*stards from the dimension will pull.”</p>
<p>“I’m just afraid that those fellows will deal with Human like they dealt with Ya. If that happens, no matter how strong Human is, it’ll be impossible to obtain first place.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>As everyone discussed fervently, Di Tian’s eyes were filled with surprise.</p>
<p>“What a powerful move. Thankfully, he’s only at the Mythical stage. If he were at the Terror grade, even Blood Shaman probably wouldn’t have been able to escape death.” The woman continued in surprise, “Once Blood Shaman is defeated, who can match him?”</p>
<p>“There’s no need.” Di Tian shook his head and said, “The monarchs of the various races have already come to a conclusion. They are going to use the cube’s rules to kick him out.”</p>
<p>The woman heaved a long sigh of relief and said, “That’s for the best. I didn’t expect there to be an outcome so quickly.”</p>
<p>Di Tian said coldly, “They know very well that the Dimensional Wheel can never land in the hands of humans. That strike just now was the main reason they made the decision so quickly.”</p>
<p>With that said, Di Tian stood up. As the host of the cube battle, after obtaining the permission of the various races, he could activate the cube’s rules and kick Zhou Wen out.</p>
<p>However, this method of kicking wasn’t a proper process. Di Tian had to personally arrive in front of the cube before he could change the rules and kick Zhou Wen out.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t immediately head to the cube. Instead, he summoned a warrior from the Celestial Gods and asked, “How’s the progress of the Body Cleansing Stone?”</p>
<p>“We’ve already obtained it. We’re escorting it back,” the warrior answered.</p>
<p>“Get them to send the Body Cleansing Stone directly to the cube.” As Di Tian spoke, he walked towards the cube.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. The might of the Immortal Slaying Strike exceeded his imagination. He originally wanted to kill Blood Shaman, but he had never expected to slay the seven Guardians together.</p>
<p>However, this wasn’t the main reason for Zhou Wen’s surprise. What truly surprised him was that the Immortal Culling Sword that Zhou Wen had kept beside him hadn’t reacted previously, but when he used Immortal Slaying, the Immortal Culling Sword had reacted.</p>
<p>No one challenged him again. Everyone was frightened by the seven Guardians’ corpses. Unless a Terror-grade expert appeared, no one would dare to challenge Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t leave the arena. He knew that the dimension definitely wouldn’t let the matter rest after his huge commotion and his killing of seven Guardians in one strike. He was afraid that he would soon receive the same treatment as Ya.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen expected, just as everyone was still immersed in the unbelievable strike of Human, they suddenly saw the black cube glow brightly as the entire arena’s space distorted.</p>
<p>The “Human” word in first place was gradually disappearing.</p>
<p>“Screw you. Again.”</p>
<p>“I knew those bastards would use this move again. If they can’t beat him, they’ll just kick him.”</p>
<p>Everyone immediately knew what had happened. They were even more furious, but they could only watch as the number one “Human” on the rankings gradually vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a strange power descend on him as though it wanted to sever something from his body. The power couldn’t be seen or touched, and the thing it slashed wasn’t Zhou Wen’s body. If an ordinary person couldn’t sense it, they would have been kicked out.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s Wheel of Destiny had been engraved with the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. Its power played its role, allowing Zhou Wen to sense the strange power.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder was activated by the power. The scripture book that had been closed automatically opened.</p>
<p>This development left Zhou Wen slightly taken aback. He had never seen such a change when he was at the Epic stage, nor had he seen the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder open.</p>
<p>The terrifying power was absorbed by the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. It was just like when Zhou Wen entered a dimensional zone and encountered a taboo power.</p>
<p>The entire Heaven-Opening Scripture emitted scorching energy. What was different from before was that if the taboo power the Heaven-Opening Scripture could withstand exceeded its limits, it would spread out and be borne by Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>This time, nothing like that happened. The energy didn’t radiate. Instead, it gradually condensed on the page of the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, forming a sutra symbol.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what the sutra symbol meant, but he could vaguely comprehend its true meaning.</p>
<p>With the appearance of the sutra symbol, the mark of the Wheel of Destiny that should have vanished in a short period of time didn’t disappear for a long time. It remained on the Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>Many people cursed at the shamelessness of the dimension, believing that Human would be kicked out of the rankings like Ya. However, after the Human word in first place vanished halfway, it didn’t continue disappearing. As for Zhou Wen’s body, he wasn’t kicked out of the arena.</p>
<p>In the arena, Zhou Wen stood in midair as though an invisible force was resisting the distorted force in the arena. No matter how much the force in the arena changed, it failed to kick Zhou Wen out of the arena.</p>
<p>Instead, the remaining half of the human characters on the rankings were glowing. The disappearing strokes were slowly reappearing.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Everyone looked at the word ‘Human’ on the rankings in surprise and delight. They all held their breaths as though they were afraid that they would blow the word away if they were so much as to exhale.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1105'>Chapter 1105: The Judge’s Battle</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“How can this be?” Standing in front of the cube, the woman staring at Di Tian wore a face filled with shock.</p>
<p>Di Tian had clearly already erased Human’s ranking on the cube, but that erased ranking actually gradually appeared again.</p>
<p>Di Tian looked at the transformed cube in front of him and couldn’t help but frown slightly. He attempted to wipe off the name ‘Human’ again, but the outcome was the same. Even if the ‘Human’ word on the ranking vanished, the Guardian in second place didn’t advance.</p>
<p>After a while, the word ‘Human’ reappeared.</p>
<p>Seeing the words on the rankings disappear and reappear, many people were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, what kind of sh*t is this? An erased name can still get back on?”</p>
<p>“The sky is falling. Those fellows from the dimension can’t kick Human away?”</p>
<p>“You can do that?”</p>
<p>“Haha, this is interesting. Those b*stards from the dimension can’t kick Human away, nor can they beat him. If they don’t have other means, I’m afraid Human will be getting first place.”</p>
<p>“Awesome, those b*tches must be hopping mad now, right?”</p>
<p>“Amazing. How did he do it?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The various bigwigs of the dimension also wanted to know how it was done, but the cube itself was an ancient magical item. It wasn’t man-made and had its own rules. The dimensional creatures’ research on the cube was still ongoing. They could only use some loopholes in the rules to control it. It was far from being able to do whatever they wanted.</p>
<p>Di Tian had already tried a few times, but the outcome was the same. He was unable to completely remove Human from the cube.</p>
<p>The woman looked at Zhou Wen’s figure through the cube’s screen and said, “Your Excellency, it’s a good thing you had foresight and prepared the Body Cleansing Stone ahead of time. Otherwise, I’m afraid first place will really fall to that person.”</p>
<p>Di Tian had already given up on modifying the cube’s rules. Clearly, it was useless.</p>
<p>“I didn’t really expect it to be used,” Di Tian said calmly.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, who do you plan on letting use the power of the Body Cleansing Stone?” the woman asked.</p>
<p>Di Tian didn’t answer as he looked at Zhou Wen in the arena.</p>
<p>The Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder experienced the invasion of the cube’s laws again and again. The sutra symbols in the sutra became more complete and brighter. Zhou Wen didn’t even need to deliberately engrave them on the Wheel of Destiny to maintain his state without disappearing.</p>
<p>Finally, the word ‘Human’ on the rankings stopped changing and stabilized at first place.</p>
<p>As the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder lost its energy supply, the sutra no longer changed. However, it didn’t disappear. It froze.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen quickly realized that even the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder was difficult to permanently store on the Wheel of Destiny. It only lasted a little longer and didn’t immediately vanish. However, over time, the engravings would slowly disappear.</p>
<p>However, this was extremely good news for Zhou Wen. This was because with the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder existing for a longer period of time. He didn’t need to constantly engrave it. The time and effort he saved could be used to engrave other Essence Energy Arts, giving him the power of multiple Essence Energy Arts.</p>
<p>“Human’s ranking has stabilized. Is him getting first place almost guaranteed?”</p>
<p>“It looks like the first place is secured.”</p>
<p>“They can’t even kick him away. What other moves can they have? I think Human’s definitely first.”</p>
<p>“Haha, I’ll acknowledge this first place.”</p>
<p>“As everyone wishes.”</p>
<p>Just as everyone thought that first place was definite this time and there shouldn’t be any suspense, a beam shot down from the arena like a holy light descending from the sky.</p>
<p>A distorted shadow slowly descended from the beam. This figure was very familiar to humans.</p>
<p>However, when they saw him appear, everyone muttered inwardly, unsure what he was up to.</p>
<p>Previously, this figure would change the rules every time it appeared, making it extremely disadvantageous for humans. No one knew how he would change the rules this time.</p>
<p>“Without a Guardian to defeat Human, it’s useless no matter how the rules are changed.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. You can’t kick Human away. No amount of tricks will work.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Why waste time? Can’t you just let Human get first place?”</p>
<p>Many people thought about it. It seemed that no matter how the rules changed, as long as no one could defeat Human, first place was undeniable.</p>
<p>If someone could defeat Human in the arena in a clean fight, the dimension wouldn’t have resorted to so many tricks.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou should be safe, right?” Although he couldn’t figure out how the rules could be changed to kick Zhou Wen out, Li Xuan still had some doubts. He felt that things weren’t that simple, so he asked Wei Ge.</p>
<p>“Unless there’s someone who can defeat Zhou Wen and participate in the battle, it’s useless changing the rules.” Wei Ge paused and said with a heavy expression, “I’m just afraid…”</p>
<p>“What are you afraid of?” Li Xuan pressed.</p>
<p>“I’m just afraid that Calamity-grade dimensional creatures will descend to participate in the battle,” Wei Ge said.</p>
<p>“No way, right? Dimensional creatures will be greatly suppressed on Earth. Just like the fellow who fought Ya previously. At most, he can only use the strength of a Terror-grade. Such a Calamity cannot defeat Old Zhou,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Wei Ge shook his head and said, “I read quite a lot about ancient Mythical wars in the bureau. If there really were dimensional creatures participating in those ancient wars, they definitely wouldn’t be as simple as a Terror-grade. There’s a high chance that a Calamity-grade dimensional creature has existed on Earth. Perhaps they have a way to withstand the suppression of the rules on Earth.”</p>
<p>“No way. Wouldn’t that mean Old Zhou is in danger?” Li Xuan’s expression changed slightly. Just as he was about to say something, he suddenly saw a terrifying change in the arena.</p>
<p>Previously, every time Di Tian descended, he was only a distorted humanoid figure without a corporeal body.</p>
<p>However, the descent this time was completely different. As the light gradually descended, it gradually solidified.</p>
<p>A gorgeous emperor’s robe, long white hair, and the faintly discernible golden armor under the emperor’s robe made Di Tian appear like a god gradually walking out of the beam of light. His body became more and more corporeal as his aura became more and more terrifying.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you were right?” Li Xuan said with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it.” Wei Ge shrugged helplessly.</p>
<p>Can Coach defeat a Calamity-grade entity? Feng Qiuyan calmly analyzed, but no matter how he analyzed it, he felt that the chances of victory were extremely slim.</p>
<p>Wang Lu hugged Ya’er and didn’t say a word. She just couldn’t hide her worry.</p>
<p>The ordinary people watching the battle realized what had happened as their expressions changed drastically.</p>
<p>“Are they sending the referee in because they can’t beat him in a fight? Isn’t this too shameless?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1106'>Chapter 1106: Di Tian</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression was solemn. He knew that the other party definitely wasn’t cannon fodder that had come to die for it to descend at this moment. There was a high chance that it was a Calamity-grade existence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, being able to preside over the cube battle meant that the other party’s status in the dimension wasn’t low.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy was the first to be summoned. His Companion Beast equipment had already been restored. Truth Listener’s earring constantly scanned the figure, but other than the powerful, terrifying aura, Truth Listener couldn’t hear anything.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Zhou Wen already had the intention to retreat. Above the Mythical stage, there was a huge gap between every grade. For example, power below the Terror grade couldn’t harm a Terror-grade creature.</p>
<p>Calamity-grade entities had their own uniqueness. Even a Terror-grade entity was as weak as a baby in front of a Calamity-grade entity, much less Zhou Wen who had just entered the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>If the dimensional creatures that descended really had the strength of the true Calamity grade, there was probably no chance of winning even if Demonic Neonate and Banana Fairy were summoned.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen planned on taking a look first. If he was certain that the other party was a true Calamity-grade, he would admit defeat and leave. Although Zhou Wen also wanted to take first place, his life was clearly more important.</p>
<p>When Di Tian walked out of the light beam, Zhou Wen was very certain that this was definitely a complete Calamity grade, not the kind of Terror-grade Calamity idiot that Ya had defeated.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen chose to forfeit and admit defeat without giving Di Tian a chance to attack.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen’s expression changed. He had clearly given up and admitted defeat, but he hadn’t been teleported out. He remained in the cube’s arena.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen constantly circulated the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, but it was useless. The Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder couldn’t let him leave the arena.</p>
<p>“Do you want to forfeit and admit defeat? I’m afraid you no longer have a chance.” Di Tian walked out of the beam of light as his body completely condensed. However, even though he was standing there, one wouldn’t be able to see what he looked like with their eyes.</p>
<p>Despite clearly feeling that he had seen him, Zhou Wen couldn’t describe what he looked like. He only felt that the person was like an emperor or god that brought about supreme pressure. Everything in the world seemed tiny and weak in front of him.</p>
<p>Di Tian looked at Zhou Wen and continued, “You have the nomological power on you, so you can ignore the cube’s rules and prevent yourself from being kicked out. Since you want to stay so badly, I shall fulfill your wish and activate the cube’s deathmatch mode. Now, the cube has completely severed its connection with the outside world’s spacetime. It will only open again if one side dies. It’s useless even if you can break the rules because there’s no way out.”</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Zhou Wen knew that what Di Tian said was true. Otherwise, the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder wouldn’t be useless. His mind raced as he thought of all the possible ways of escape.</p>
<p>“Di Tian, Lord of the Celestial Gods,” Di Tian calmly replied.</p>
<p>The Celestial Gods of the Octokind? Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know much about the dimension, nor did he know much about the Calamity-grade powerhouses in the dimension. It just so happened that he knew that the Lord of the Celestial Gods was a Calamity-grade powerhouse.</p>
<p>Due to Wang Mingyuan, Zhou Wen had learned some information regarding the Octokind. The Octokind were eight different dimensional races.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan defeated the Dragon Gods’ king and became the new Dragon King. According to Ice Maiden, six of the eight monarchs of the Octokind were at the Terror grade, while only two were at the Calamity grade. Di Tian was one of them and also the leader of the Octokind.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan had snatched the Dragon King’s position, but he hadn’t touched Di Tian. From this, one could tell how terrifying Di Tian was.</p>
<p>Now that Di Tian had personally descended to kill him and his retreat path had been severed, Zhou Wen immediately felt that things were going south.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen and Di Tian’s conversation, the Federation was in an uproar.</p>
<p>Di Tian clearly wanted Human’s life, and not solely to kick him out.</p>
<p>“Do you want to leave behind your name before you die? To be killed by me is also a form of honor for you,” Di Tian said casually as though Zhou Wen’s life was already in his hands.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had secretly drawn the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art, hoping to use interstellar teleportation to see if he could teleport away.</p>
<p>However, he was very disappointed. All the stars in the Pocket Universe were dim. Clearly, he couldn’t teleport out from here.</p>
<p>Since I can’t leave, I can only give it my all. Zhou Wen gripped the white wooden club in his hand tightly. Under Zhou Wen’s orders, Banana Fairy used her Three Realms’ Best Wind.</p>
<p>A terrifying storm instantly enveloped the entire arena, sweeping towards Di Tian.</p>
<p>At the same time that the Three Realms’ Best Wind stirred, Zhou Wen put on the Invisibility Cloak and entered the Invisibility state. He used the Godfiend Era Energy Art he had just drawn to teleport behind Di Tian and unleashed Immortal Slaying while invisible.</p>
<p>As for Demonic Neonate, she was secretly hiding in Zhou Wen’s arms, waiting for an opportunity to take action.</p>
<p>Di Tian floated in the air as he faced Banana Fairy’s Three Realms’ Best Wind. All he did was wave his sleeve. It was as though there was a world inside his sleeve. When the terrifying Three Realms’ Best Wind rushed into his sleeve, it was like a rock sinking into the ocean. It only made his sleeve flutter a few times as though it was being caressed by a breeze.</p>
<p>The invisible Zhou Wen was about to hit Di Tian with Immortal Slaying, but without even turning his head, Di Tian casually grabbed the white wooden club and threw Zhou Wen in front of him.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body slammed into the arena as blood spewed out of his mouth. He couldn’t hold the white wooden club in his hand as it tumbled out.</p>
<p>Di Tian didn’t do a follow-up attack. Instead, he held the white wooden club and sized it up. Then, he muttered to himself, “It’s indeed the Mourning Stick. Unfortunately, it’s not complete. It’s just an incomplete item.”</p>
<p>Banana Fairy was worried about Zhou Wen, so she flew over and stood in front of him. The banana leaf transformed into a fan that fanned at Di Tian.</p>
<p>Di Tian waved his sleeve again, but this time, not only did he suck in Banana Fairy’s wind, but the sleeve also became extremely huge as though it covered the void. There was a huge suction force inside that pulled Banana Fairy’s body, causing her to involuntarily fly towards the sleeve.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy tried her best to use her wind-elemental powers to escape the suction of the sleeve, but she was still pulled into it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen endured the pain and summoned Truth Listener.</p>
<p>Even Demonic Neonate didn’t move, so ordinary Mythical Companion Beasts were even more useless. In front of a Calamity-grade existence, an existence like Banana Fairy didn’t have much room to resist. Now, the only power Zhou Wen could think of was Truth Listener.</p>
<p>The moment Truth Listener was summoned, it charged at Di Tian. While in midair, the earrings on its six ears shattered one after another as its body constantly changed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had only released a maximum of three earrings in the past. He didn’t dare try any further as he didn’t know what would happen if Truth Listener’s six earrings were all released.</p>
<p>However, now that it was a life-and-death situation, he couldn’t care less.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1107'>Chapter 1107: Six-Earring Destruction Leads to Calamity</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>When Truth Listener’s fourth earring shattered, its body vanished. Ordinary people could only see a terrifying dark-gold behemoth charge at Di Tian before vanishing in midair.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen could clearly see that Truth Listener had already entered its Terror form when it shattered the fourth earring.</p>
<p>The fourth earring puts it in the Terror form. What will happen if all six earrings shatter? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he felt a chill.</p>
<p>This was because after the fourth earring shattered, the connection between Truth Listener and him had become extremely weak. It was almost impossible to sense it.</p>
<p>The moment the fifth earring shattered, Zhou Wen felt as though an invisible chain had been severed between them. He couldn’t sense any information from Truth Listener.</p>
<p>When the sixth earring shattered, Truth Listener had already rushed in front of Di Tian. However, at that instant, Truth Listener, which had vanished due to its Terror form, appeared in everyone’s eyes again.</p>
<p>At that moment, Truth Listener was like an ancient ferocious beast from hell. Its entire body shimmered with a dark golden glow, and its protruding fangs resembled crystal diamonds. The violent and ferocious aura it emitted made one shudder as it resembled an extremely evil beast.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that as Truth Listener appeared in everyone’s vision again, the entire arena also discovered a strange change. A Door to Hell opened behind Truth Listener.</p>
<p>The door was the same as Truth Listener’s body. It was dark-gold in color and there were countless mysterious, beautiful runes engraved on it. They had a fatal allure that seemed to suck one’s soul into the door.</p>
<p>With the appearance of the Door to Hell, countless evil spirits and ferocious ghosts emerged from the ground. Arms extended from the ground as the Door to Hell opened. Terrifying ferocious beasts that had never been seen before rushed out.</p>
<p>As for the Door to Hell, it emitted an even more terrifying aura and roar, as though there was an even more terrifying existence rushing out of it.</p>
<p>Instantly, the entire arena seemed to turn into Shura hell. There were terrifying hellish evil spirits and ferocious beasts everywhere.</p>
<p>As for the hellish aura that constantly spewed out from the Door of Hell, it filled the entire space. In the increasingly dense hellish aura, most Mythical creatures would quickly die, much less fight.</p>
<p>Calamity grade! Zhou Wen was finally certain that Truth Listener, who had released the six earrings, had reached the height of a Calamity-grade entity.</p>
<p>The power of a Terror-grade was indescribable, but after reaching the Calamity-grade, the power would transform into a Calamity Domain. Even if one were to see it, human strength would not be able to fight a Calamity-grade. They could only struggle and wait for death or wait for Lady Luck’s blessing to survive the Calamity.</p>
<p>As Truth Listener had already severed its connection with Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen was also affected by the death aura of Hell. In the death aura, the vitality in his body rapidly drained as his body began to age.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen had Absolute Defense armor on him, allowing him to temporarily withstand the corrosion of Hell’s death aura.</p>
<p>However, the horde of evil spirits and ferocious beasts didn’t identify Zhou Wen as a friend or Truth Listener’s former owner. They surged towards him like a tidal wave, hoping to tear him to pieces.</p>
<p>They looked extremely terrifying. Any one of them probably had the strength of a Mythical creature. With so many Mythical creatures swarming forward, even Zhou Wen felt his heart tremble.</p>
<p>With the Mourning Stick snatched away by Di Tian, Zhou Wen immediately engraved Supreme Hell King on his Wheel of Destiny. The power of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra immediately descended on his body, augmenting it greatly.</p>
<p>More importantly, after Supreme Hell King fused with Zhou Wen’s body, the hellish evil spirits and ferocious beasts seemed to show fear towards him. Or perhaps they treated him as one of them and stopped charging at him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Truth Listener let out a ruthless roar. With the augmentation of the boundless death aura from Hell, it charged at Di Tian like a demonic god.</p>
<p>A Calamity-grade Companion Beast! A glint flashed in Jing Daoxian’s eyes as he stared at Truth Listener. His expression changed as he fell into deep thought.</p>
<p>How is that possible? How can a Calamity-grade Companion Beast appear on Earth? How long has it been since Essence Energy was revived? The woman following Di Tian was also stunned.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the woman. Many races in the dimension watched this scene in shock. A Calamity-grade Companion Beast had actually appeared on Earth. It was unimaginable.</p>
<p>In the eyes of ordinary people, all they could see was hell and countless evil spirits and ferocious beasts. It was as though the entire arena had turned into hell.</p>
<p>However, they could no longer see Truth Listener’s figure. Truth Listener’s speed and ability far exceeded what human vision could capture, but such a scene was enough to let their imagination run wild.</p>
<p>“Could it be… That’s a Calamity-grade Companion Beast…”</p>
<p>“This is way too ridiculous. How can there be a Calamity-grade Companion Beast? This doesn’t make sense!”</p>
<p>“Ignoring everything else, I really admire Human’s Companion Beasts.”</p>
<p>“I originally thought that the Terror-grade humanoid Companion Beast was already the limit. I never expected…”</p>
<p>“There’s hope. Calamity versus Calamity. That Di Tian might not win. Human still has a chance of getting first place.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps…”</p>
<p>Everyone was extremely excited. They originally believed that there was no hope, but they never expected Human to give them a huge surprise.</p>
<p>“Calamity-grade… That’s a Calamity-grade Companion Beast… How did Young Master Wen do it?” An Sheng said excitedly.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo looked at the hellish arena in the scene and fell silent for the first time.</p>
<p>In Chess Mountain’s base, An Jing and the troops on Chess Mountain who weren’t on duty were watching the live broadcast on the sports field. When she saw Truth Listener showcase its Calamity-grade strength, An Jing’s expression turned extremely complicated.</p>
<p>That person seemed to be getting further and further away from her.</p>
<p>“Calamity-grade… That’s a Calamity-grade Companion Beast… How did he do it?” The Zhang family’s family head’s eyes turned red.</p>
<p>If the Zhang family had such a Companion Beast, how could the Holy Temple restrain them?</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the Zhang family. The core members of the other five families were also pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>The appearance of a Calamity-grade Companion Beast opened a new world for them. It made everyone know that not only could Companion Beasts resist Guardians, but they could even fight terrifying existences of the dimension. The potential of Companion Beasts was far greater than they imagined.</p>
<p>Due to Truth Listener’s Calamity Domain, the power of Strength’s sleeve decreased drastically. Zhou Wen took the opportunity to unsummon Banana Fairy.</p>
<p>As for Di Tian, he didn’t continue forcefully sucking Banana Fairy because Truth Listener had already arrived in front of him with the boundless death aura and countless hellish evil spirits.</p>
<p>2</p>
<h3 id='chapter1108'>Chapter 1108: Humans Don’t Fight With The Heavens</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Finish him! Zhou Wen could only secretly pray that Truth Listener could kill Di Tian. Otherwise, he really didn’t have the strength to fight Di Tian.</p>
<p>In fact, even Zhou Wen had never expected Truth Listener to reach the level of a Calamity. This was already a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>However, Truth Listener had completely severed its connection with him after reaching the Calamity grade. It was probably impossible to regain ownership of it. Zhou Wen couldn’t tell if it was a blessing or a curse.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>If Truth Listener defeated Di Tian, would it count as him winning this battle? Or would Truth Listener kill him, its former owner?</p>
<p>Looking at the ruthless Truth Listener that resembled a devil from hell, Zhou Wen felt that the possibility was very high.</p>
<p>The entire power of hell seemed to lunge at Di Tian with Truth Listener. A look of surprise flashed in Di Tian’s eyes, but he didn’t show any intention of retreating. He slowly extended his palm to suppress it.</p>
<p>With the movement of his palm, the sky was filled with gods and Buddhas. They flew around him as though Heaven had descended from the sky.</p>
<p>The spectators were dumbfounded. What they saw was hell rising and the heaven descending. At the moment of this pandemonic collision, countless terrifying phenomena emerged.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>If this scene hadn’t happened in the cube’s arena but on Earth, a huge city would have been destroyed by this strike.</p>
<p>“Is this the power of a Calamity-grade entity?” Everyone felt their hearts tremble. A single strike was enough to destroy the world. Gods, Buddhas, and ferocious beasts wreaked havoc everywhere. It was like hell on earth.</p>
<p>They didn’t dare imagine how many people would die if such a force erupted in human settlements. Even Mythical experts would probably die.</p>
<p>“No good!” Li Xuan exclaimed. This was because he saw the power of hell descending, and the power of the heaven constantly suppressing it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also knew that things weren’t good. Others couldn’t see the clash between Truth Listener and Di Tian, but Zhou Wen’s Wheel of Destiny allowed him to see some of it, especially when Truth Listener and Di Tian were motionless.</p>
<p>Di Tian’s palm pressed down on Truth Listener’s dark-gold claws, forcefully suppressing it. Truth Listener’s huge body was about to be pressed down into the arena.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>In the next second, Truth Listener’s body had already landed on the arena. It propped its feet on the ground and used its claws to resist Di Tian’s palm, but its back was bent from the suppression.</p>
<p>The hellish scene was almost completely shattered by the scene of heaven. Truth Listener and Di Tian’s figures appeared.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Truth Listener being suppressed by a single hand of Di Tian, its body slowly arching as it started to kneel on the ground, everyone was shocked.</p>
<p>Such a powerful Companion Beast was actually suppressed by Di Tian to the point of being unable to stand. What powerful strength was this?</p>
<p>They didn’t know that as the leader of the Octokind, Di Tian was a top-notch existence among the Calamity grade entities. Although Truth Listener had entered the Calamity grade, its method of entering the Calamity grade had actually been through a trick. It could only be considered as having just entered the Calamity grade, so there was still a gap between it and Di Tian.</p>
<p>“It’s over. Even such a powerful Companion Beast can’t fight dimensional creatures. Dimensional creatures are just too powerful.” Someone sighed, but most people were silent.</p>
<p>Di Tian’s strength and invincibility had already been deeply imprinted in the minds of every human. It made them feel an indescribable sense of powerlessness. They felt as if their strength had been sucked away.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that they really didn’t have any strength left. It was just that they were suffering from too much despair in their hearts. The mental blow was too great and they were too disappointed.</p>
<p>So what if they could nurture Companion Beasts to be as powerful as Human’s Companion Beasts? They would still be suppressed by dimensional creatures with one hand.</p>
<p>Humans weren’t afraid of difficulties, but they were afraid of not seeing hope. And Di Tian’s strength had already made many people despair.</p>
<p>Even if humans rely on external forces, they are far from being able to fight dimensional creatures. This thought was buried deep in their hearts.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t have the time for such wistful thoughts. This was because he knew that Truth Listener’s defeat meant that he would die. It would be impossible for Di Tian to spare him.</p>
<p>What should I do? How can I turn the tables? Countless plans flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind, but he rejected them all.</p>
<p>No matter how powerful a technique was, it was useless in front of absolute strength. Zhou Wen couldn’t think of any strength he had that could match Di Tian.</p>
<p>Sigh of the King? Zhou Wen finally thought of his strange Life Providence.</p>
<p>However, ever since he had forcefully reversed the Wheel of Destiny, the Sigh of the King had had no reaction at all. Perhaps it was completely disappointed in him so it no longer gave him any feedback.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept trying, but the Sigh of the King didn’t stir.</p>
<p>What a pity. Truth Listener’s evolution was too fast. If it had been a little slower, it might still have had a chance. In a cave at the foot of Chess Mountain, there was an extremely beautiful woman chained up. The woman looked at the phone screen in front of her and sighed. I originally thought that I could find someone compatible with me to escape, but who knew that it would be such a suicidal fellow. From the looks of it, I can only continue searching for others. I wonder how long I’ll have to wait.</p>
<p>Even a powerhouse like The Thearch believed that Zhou Wen no longer had a chance.</p>
<p>A battle between Calamity-grade creatures wasn’t something ordinary creatures could participate in. Unless Zhou Wen had a second Calamity Companion Beast, the outcome was set.</p>
<p>What a pity. Jing Daoxian, who was in the ancient temple, also sighed. However, it was unknown if he felt pity for Truth Listener or Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Wang Lu, Li Xuan, Feng Qiuyan, Wei Ge, and company had their hearts in their throats. They knew that Truth Listener’s defeat would spell Zhou Wen’s death, but no one had the ability to help him. All they could do was watch helplessly and pray for a miracle.</p>
<p>God, help him. At the very least, let him live. Wang Lu could only pray for God’s help. However, her level was too low. Even with the augmentation of her Life Providence, the effects were minute.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>One of Truth Listener’s legs touched the ground as it half-knelt. It roared angrily as dark golden blood seeped out of its seven orifices. Its entire body exerted all its strength, but it was unable to stand up under the huge hand. Furthermore, it was constantly bending under the pressure.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Truth Listener’s other leg supported its body by pressing against the ground as it refused to yield. However, it was snapped by the terrifying pressure, revealing its broken bones.</p>
<p>Truth Listener’s ferocious nature erupted as it crazily unleashed its strength, but it was useless. Only blood flowed out from its fracture, dyeing the arena red.</p>
<p>“Humans don’t fight with the heavens. Slaves don’t fight with the master. This is the law of the world. It’s also destined. This is the consequence of going against the will of the heavens.” Di Tian’s voice was like divine thunder that spread to every corner of the world.</p>
<p>Anger, indignation, helplessness, sorrow, despair, and other emotions spread in everyone’s hearts, but there was nothing they could do.</p>
<p>Di Tian stood there with the vantage of a god and looked down on all human beings. Even if there was any indignation, they were powerless to knock that god off his pedestal. At this moment, saying anything was just inviting insults</p>
<h3 id='chapter1109'>Chapter 1109: Immortal Culling Sword</h3>

<p>The oppressive atmosphere spread silently. Everyone’s hearts were extremely heavy. The area in front of almost all the cubes was dead silent.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo stood up and stared intently at the screen. An Sheng’s nervous palms were covered in sweat.</p>
<p>“You have to come back alive.” Ouyang Lan sat in front of the television with the remote control in her hand. Her body involuntarily trembled.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Truth Listener’s body was pressed onto the arena. The Door to Hell behind it shattered and vanished into thin air. The numerous evil spirits and ferocious beast phenomena also vanished.</p>
<p>Looking at Truth Listener struggling on stage, everyone’s hearts turned cold. All their indignation and anger vanished.</p>
<p>Anger was useless, and no justice came from it, so what was the point of being angry?</p>
<p>As Truth Listener was suppressed to the ground, the phenomena of deities descended. Countless deities attacked Zhou Wen from all sides.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that this was his last chance. If Truth Listener was killed and he didn’t have any powers to restrain Di Tian, he would have even less of a chance.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate hadn’t made a move all this while. Clearly, she couldn’t find a chance to attack. Facing the Calamity-grade Di Tian, her strength was still too weak.</p>
<p>He summoned Banana Fairy again. Banana Fairy protected Zhou Wen and blew out Supreme Yin Wind, blowing away the deities.</p>
<p>However, in Di Tian’s Calamity Domain, the power of the Supreme Yin Wind was greatly restricted. It could only blow them away, but it couldn’t take their lives. It was also impossible to blow them out of the arena.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen held the Immortal Culling Sword in his hand.</p>
<p>With the white wooden club snatched away, Zhou Wen’s most powerful weapon was the Ice Dragon King’s Terror Item. However, the Terror item was of limited threat to a Calamity. Even if he used it, it probably wouldn’t be of much use.</p>
<p>Under the ratman’s control, the Immortal Culling Sword had once erupted with extraordinary combat strength. Furthermore, when Zhou Wen used Immortal Slaying, the Immortal Culling Sword had once trembled.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen could only try his best. He took out the Immortal Culling Sword to give it a try. If it was really the legendary sword, he might be able to create a miracle.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen knew that the possibility was slim. If it was really the Immortal Culling Sword, how could it have been in the ratman’s hands?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the Immortal Culling Sword and fused with Slaughterer again to deliver Immortal Slaying.</p>
<p>However, the Immortal Culling Sword in his hand didn’t slash out. The sword seemed to freeze in midair, preventing Zhou Wen from swinging it no matter how hard he tried.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Immortal Culling Sword was trembling slightly. The frequency at which the sword trembled was very similar to the frequency at which Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy fluctuated when he used Immortal Slaying.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s horror, his palm seemed to be stuck to the hilt. He couldn’t shake it off no matter how hard he tried. Furthermore, his Essence Energy was crazily surging into the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had always believed that Slaughterer provided him with infinite Essence Energy that wouldn’t dry up no matter how much he used it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen suddenly realized that the Essence Energy provided by Slaughterer didn’t seem to be truly infinite. It was only because there had been too much in the past that Zhou Wen felt that it was infinite no matter how he used it.</p>
<p>However, the amount of Essence Energy that the Immortal Culling Sword extracted exceeded the Essence Energy provided by Slaughterer.</p>
<p>If the Essence Energy provided by Slaughterer was the sea, then the Immortal Culling Sword was a behemoth that devoured the sea. When the massive amount of Essence Energy was sucked into the Immortal Culling Sword, there wasn’t much of a reaction. Only the frequency at which the Immortal Culling Sword vibrated increased.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Wen’s body frequency was affected by the Immortal Culling Sword as it trembled slightly.</p>
<p>This trembling was very mild and almost undetectable, but Zhou Wen knew that the change in frequency had given the original Immortal Slaying a qualitative breakthrough.</p>
<p>This was originally a good thing, but the Essence Energy provided by Slaughterer was no longer able to withstand the absorption of the Immortal Culling Sword. The Essence Energy turned from an ocean to a river, and then from a river to a stream before gradually drying up.</p>
<p>After Slaughterer’s Essence Energy was drained, Zhou Wen’s body became the subsequent sacrifice. His essence, vitality, spirit, and even his flesh and blood were sucked towards the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was only at the Mythical stage and didn’t have as much Essence Energy as Slaughterer. How could he withstand the suction? Instantly, his body was sucked dry.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate, who was in his arms, sensed Zhou Wen’s predicament. She pressed her tiny hand on Zhou Wen’s chest as large amounts of her Essence Energy surged into his body. Finally, the Immortal Culling Sword stopped absorbing Zhou Wen’s flesh and blood and instead absorbed Demonic Neonate’s Essence Energy.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate had an abundant supply of Essence Energy, as though it wasn’t inferior to Slaughterer. It was even more massive, but even so, under the crazy absorption of the Immortal Culling Sword, it rapidly decreased.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could clearly sense that the Essence Energy that Demonic Neonate had injected into his body was decreasing.</p>
<p>Before long, the Essence Energy in Demonic Neonate’s body gradually dried up. As for Demonic Neonate’s tiny hand, it remained pressed against Zhou Wen’s chest.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could see that Demonic Neonate’s body was gradually fading. Soon, it became as transparent as jelly.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate was a Companion Beast and not an ordinary creature. Her body was formed from pure energy, and her body gradually turned transparent. It could only mean one thing. Demonic Neonate had given him the last of her energy. Once her energy was completely absorbed, she would completely disappear.</p>
<p>“Leave me.” Zhou Wen forcefully engraved the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art and used the last of his willpower to forcefully flick Demonic Neonate out and terminate her Companion Beast relationship with him, but he realized that he couldn’t control her.</p>
<p>As for Demonic Neonate’s body, it became increasingly transparent. At this speed, it would probably only take a few seconds before it completely vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sighed inwardly. He knew that even if he forcefully removed his relationship with Demonic Neonate in the arena, Demonic Neonate wouldn’t be able to escape. She would ultimately die.</p>
<p>Even if you have to die, you have to die after me. I’m a very selfish person. I don’t wish to grieve for others. Zhou Wen immediately injected his remaining strength into the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate was, after all, transmitting energy indirectly. She couldn’t do it as directly as Zhou Wen. Under Zhou Wen’s guidance, her already emaciated body, which was almost sucked dry, experienced a certain level of improvement.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen thought he was about to die, an energy suddenly erupted from his body. It nourished his dry body like spring water and surged towards the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Sigh of the King… Zhou Wen was alarmed and delighted. The Sigh of the King that hadn’t stirred all this time finally reacted.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Massive energy made up for the energy gap needed for the Immortal Culling Sword. A large amount of Essence Energy surged into it as the trembling the Immortal Culling Sword finally calmed down. However, Zhou Wen could clearly sense that a terrifying power was awakening in the sword.</p>

<p>Under Di Tian’s suppression, Truth Listener’s bones emitted cracking sounds. It was unknown how many bones broke as its body became severely deformed. Dark-gold blood flowed out of its seven orifices and wounds, dyeing the entire arena dark-gold.</p>
<p>“You are quite interesting, but what a pity. In your next life, remember to be born in the dimension. Don’t be associated with humans again.” The power in Di Tian’s hand grew stronger and stronger. The sky was filled with gods, Buddhas, and fairies—all of them bent on obliterating Truth Listener.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Truth Listener, whose body was about to explode from the pressure. They were indescribably shocked as fear silently spread.</p>
<p>“You keep talking about humans. How irritating.” Suddenly, a voice sounded in the arena.</p>
<p>Only then did everyone recall that Zhou Wen still existed in the arena. Previously, their attention had been completely attracted by Truth Listener and Di Tian’s battle, so they had forgotten about Zhou Wen, the true protagonist in the battle.</p>
<p>They looked at Zhou Wen and saw him standing in Di Tian’s Calamity Domain with a sword in hand. Banana Fairy was beside him, desperately resisting the deities that were lunging at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Everyone was somewhat depressed. Although Human wasn’t dead yet, he would die once Truth Listener was defeated. After all, Human was only at the Mythical stage. The Terror-grade Companion Beast, Banana Fairy, could barely protect herself in the Calamity Domain. She had no right to fight Di Tian.</p>
<p>“Humans need to know their standing against the heavenly mandate. If you hadn’t insisted on defying the heavens, you wouldn’t have ended up in such a state. This is the outcome of defying the heavens.” Di Tian continued suppressing Truth Listener with one hand. No matter how Truth Listener roared, it couldn’t escape from his grasp.</p>
<p>“Know one’s standing? What do you mean by heavenly mandate? Who’s the heavens? You?” Zhou Wen questioned Di Tian.</p>
<p>“To you humans, I am the heavenly mandate. If I want you to live, you will live. If I want you dead, you must die,” Di Tian said indifferently, his tone as calm as though it was only right.</p>
<p>Everyone fell silent. Although Di Tian’s words infuriated humans, they couldn’t refute him. In front of the Calamity grade, humans were as puny as ants. All they could do was beg for mercy from the heavens.</p>
<p>“If you are the heavenly mandate, what’s the harm in defying the heavens?” As Zhou Wen spoke, his hand holding the ancient sword finally moved.</p>
<p>The ancient sword was still wrapped in a scabbard. Moving with Zhou Wen’s palm, the ancient sword was pulled out inch by inch. The sword shimmered with a dazzling light that could steal one’s soul as boundless killing intent surged out from the sword.</p>
<p>The sword seemed to have some kind of magical power. In just an inch of unsheathing, it made the people watching through the screen feel ice-cold. It was as though the killing intent had penetrated their hearts as their bodies trembled.</p>
<p>Di Tian’s eyes focused as he stared intently at the sword in Zhou Wen’s hand. Even his hand that was suppressing Truth Listener paused.</p>
<p>“Humans don’t fight with the heavens. Slaves don’t fight with their masters. Unfortunately, you’re not the be all and end all of humans, nor are you the master of humans. If you let me live, I can live. If you want me dead, I’ll slay the heavens and destroy you.” With Zhou Wen’s cold voice, he completely unsheathed the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>He slashed at Di Tian with an Immortal Slaying strike.</p>
<p>Di Tian seemed to sense something as he released his hand that was pressing down on Truth Listener and pressed down on Zhou Wen with both hands.</p>
<p>The divine phenomenon also crazily suppressed Zhou Wen. It wasn’t just a shockwave. It was even more terrifying and powerful than Truth Listener’s suppression.</p>
<p>Layers of heavenly phenomena descended with Di Tian’s hands. A total of nine heavenly realms descended as though the end of the world was approaching.</p>
<p>And below the nine heavens, only one person defied the heavens as he drew his sword to slash upwards.</p>
<p>The seemingly tiny humans under the Calamity Domain erupted with unimaginable power the moment he released his sword beam.</p>
<p>The terrifying sword beam instantly penetrated the nine heavens and charged into it with an indomitable force. The terrifying sword beam didn’t stop as it slashed at Di Tian who was above the nine heavens.</p>
<p>Di Tian’s eyes were colored with a look of horror. He wanted to block the terrifying sword beam with both hands, but the sword beam flashed as though it had vanished in front of him.</p>
<p>The ancient sword in Zhou Wen’s hand had already returned to its scabbard. He stood in the arena as though nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Above his head, the phenomenon of the nine heavens suddenly shattered and vanished in an instant. It turned into light specks that fell like snowflakes.</p>
<p>A sword mark appeared between Di Tian’s brows as he stood above the nine heavens. Then, the sword mark quickly spread.</p>
<p>Di Tian’s pupils constricted as his body split into two. As he fell, he disintegrated along with the Nine Heavens domain.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>“This… How is this possible…” The woman who followed Di Tian to the cube stood there as though she had been petrified. She didn’t dare imagine that such a thing would happen.</p>
<p>On Earth, everyone stood rooted to the spot as though they couldn’t believe it either.</p>
<p>After a brief moment of silence, cheers erupted everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood there motionless. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to move, but that he really couldn’t move. If he hadn’t pressed down against the Immortal Culling Sword with both hands and used it as support, he probably wouldn’t have been able to stand.</p>
<p>The Immortal Culling Sword had extracted too much. Zhou Wen’s body was on the brink of collapse. It wasn’t easy for him to stand.</p>
<p>Truth Listener also collapsed from its injuries and struggled to stand up to no avail.</p>
<p>With Di Tian killed, the cube’s deathmatch mode ended. All the cubes in the world lit up at the same time.</p>
<p>All the images on the cube’s screen turned into Zhou Wen standing with a sword. The first name on the rankings lit up as well. The word ‘Human’ shimmered. Finally, the other names on the rankings vanished one by one, leaving only the word ‘Human’ glowing like an eternal existence.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen heaved a long sigh of relief. From the looks of it, the cube had already acknowledged him as first place. It hadn’t changed because of Truth Listener’s existence.</p>
<p>However, the Dimensional Wheel that had been displayed didn’t appear. Then, the cube dimmed. Zhou Wen and Truth Listener were kicked out of the cube and they returned to the town.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised that he hadn’t obtained the Dimensional Wheel. It was a reward given to first place from the dimension, but he was someone they didn’t wish to see clinch first place. With the way the dimension worked, it would be unbelievable that they would give him the Dimensional Wheel.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the tattoo on his body and saw that Demonic Neonate had already returned to him. Although the color of the tattoo had turned a little dim and looked almost indiscernible, it didn’t disappear. Only then did he heave a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Truth Listener struggled to stand up. Its entire body was severely injured, but it remained ferocious like a ghoul. It stared at Zhou Wen fiercely as though it wanted to pounce over and devour him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1111'>Chapter 1111: The Missing Guardian</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Where did Grim Demon go? As Zhou Wen retreated, he looked around, but he didn’t see Grim Demon.</p>
<p>Grim Demon had also entered the cube’s arena from this area. He should still be here after admitting defeat.</p>
<p>Previously, he hadn’t seen Grim Demon participate in the group battle of the top ten Guardians. Now that he couldn’t be found, Zhou Wen wondered if he had already been killed.</p>
<p>Previously, Grim Demon had publicly pledged his loyalty. It was definitely impossible for the dimension to let him fight. It wasn’t impossible to think of a way to kill him.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to look for Grim Demon. Truth Listener had already pounced over with its heavily injured body. It had forcefully shattered six earrings and entered the Calamity grade. The many latent dangers were now apparent. Not only had it severed its connection with Zhou Wen, but even its emotions seemed to become extremely unstable; it was filled with ruthlessness and malice.</p>
<p>However, its injuries were too serious. Even though it had Calamity-grade strength, it didn’t have much of it left.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned Banana Fairy, who sent Truth Listener tumbling away with a mouthful of Supreme Yin Wind.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly restrained Banana Fairy to prevent her from killing Truth Listener.</p>
<p>He was the one who had forcefully removed six of Truth Listener’s earrings. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have turned into this state. If it wasn’t for Truth Listener, it would have been impossible for it to hold back Di Tian for so long and give Zhou Wen the time to use the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>However, Truth Listener’s mind seemed to be completely out of control. It got up and dragged its injured body over in another charge.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy sensed Zhou Wen’s thoughts, but she only blew out the wind barrier, preventing Truth Listener from rushing over. She didn’t injure it again.</p>
<p>How can I make Truth Listener return to its sealed state with six earrings? Zhou Wen attempted to give Truth Listener orders, but it was useless.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen’s body was also severely injured. Even with the help of Slaughterer and Sigh of the King, as well as Demonic Neonate’s help, Zhou Wen’s body was still severely injured. His body was on the brink of collapse, and he was so emaciated that he was only skin and bones. He didn’t look fine like before.</p>
<p>He would recover with time, but Slaughterer Life Soul had nearly been sucked dry. The Wheel of Destiny had also nearly collapsed. Although he didn’t know how Sigh of the King was, it definitely didn’t have things easy after paying such a huge price.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body was like a hole-ridden ship that had expended all its fuel. It was definitely not an easy task to set sail again.</p>
<p>He attempted to circulate his Essence Energy Art, but as his Essence Energy was depleted, even the Lost Immortal Sutra couldn’t circulate normally, much less inscribe other Essence Energy Arts on the Wheel of Destiny. This made Zhou Wen’s plan of using Chaos Egg to heal himself fail.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Truth Listener was still trying to charge through the wind barrier again and again. However, it was too heavily injured and had no strength to break through the wind barrier. All it did was roar and charge.</p>
<p>However, if this continued, Truth Listener would probably die soon.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a figure walked out of the cube, giving Zhou Wen a fright.</p>
<p>Only he and Grim Demon had entered the arena from this cube. Grim Demon had long come out. Now, the ones who could come out of the cube were most likely dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>If another powerhouse like Di Tian appeared, Zhou Wen would be powerless to deal with him.</p>
<p>Even with the Immortal Culling Sword in hand, Zhou Wen didn’t have the ability to use it again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be taken aback when he identified the person walking out of the cube.</p>
<p>Previously, in the battle with Blood Shaman, there had been eight Guardians. However, other than Grim Demon and Burial Immortal, there should only have been seven Guardians in the top ten. He didn’t know why there was one more.</p>
<p>Later, when Zhou Wen had used Immortal Slaying, he only killed seven Guardians. One of them had vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>Back then, Zhou Wen had some doubts, but he didn’t have the time to think carefully. Now that he saw that the person was the Guardian who had mysteriously appeared and vanished, he immediately guessed something.</p>
<p>The fact that he could come out meant that he had entered the cube’s arena through this cube. Then, he could assume the reason for Grim Demon’s disappearance.</p>
<p>This Guardian must have killed Grim Demon and replaced him before entering the arena.</p>
<p>However, there was something Zhou Wen didn’t understand. If he had the ability to eliminate Grim Demon, it meant that he was at least at the Terror grade. Why hadn’t he used his strength to fight him in the previous battle?</p>
<p>The Guardian slowly walked over as a terrifying aura rose from his body. The strength of this aura was definitely not inferior to Grim Demon’s.</p>
<p>In the next second, the Guardian attacked, but his target wasn’t Zhou Wen. With a wave of his hand, he grabbed Truth Listener.</p>
<p>The huge Truth Listener automatically shrank when it approached his palm and quickly became the size of a palm. At the same time, the six earrings appeared again and clamped onto its six ears.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated when he saw this. Such means were definitely not something an ordinary Terror-grade could muster. The Guardian’s origins were unimaginable.</p>
<p>The Guardian grabbed Truth Listener with one hand and slashed at Zhou Wen with the other.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy didn’t wait for Zhou Wen’s instructions as she immediately stood in front of him. She pouted her red lips and blew out boundless wind. With the augmentation of the Three Realms’ Best Wind, the boundless wind nearly blew the entire town away.</p>
<p>However, the Guardian’s sleeves didn’t budge at all. His hand blade tore through the wind like a sharp blade, circled around Banana Fairy, and instantly arrived in front of Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen didn’t even have the chance to summon his Companion Beasts to block the attack before the hand blade reached his neck.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen cursed inwardly. He was too heavily injured, so it was impossible for him to dodge. All he could do was close his eyes and wait for death.</p>
<p>I never expected that I, Zhou Wen, would die here. Zhou Wen closed his eyes and waited for death, but the attack didn’t come.</p>
<p>Feeling that something was amiss, he opened his eyes and realized that the Guardian was standing in front of him with a smile. The saber hadn’t slashed down, and he no longer looked like a Guardian. Instead, he was a refined man in white with crystal dragon horns on his head.</p>
<p>“Teacher…” Zhou Wen was alarmed and delighted. He felt as though he had instantly returned to heaven from hell.</p>
<p>“Well done.” Wang Mingyuan smiled at Zhou Wen and reached out to press his head. A strange force surged into Zhou Wen’s body, immediately making him feel as though he was bathing in a hot spring. The injuries on his body quickly healed.</p>
<p>“Teacher, there’s no need for such praises.” Zhou Wen blushed slightly.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Wang Mingyuan rapped his knuckles on the top of his head and pursed his lips. “Do you really think I’m praising you? You’re in big trouble now. Didn’t I tell you not to come again? Why did you come to participate in the cube battle and end up in first place again? Do you really think that the dimension will give you the Dimensional Wheel? Or do you think they will just let it go?”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen said helplessly, “I also know that they won’t give me the Dimensional Wheel, but I couldn’t just watch them kill Zhong Ziya without doing anything, right?”</p>
<p>“Who told you that Ziya is dead?” Wang Mingyuan said, a little peeved.</p>
<p>“Didn’t he sign a bet with the Guardian… Could it be that his bet wasn’t to come in first?” Zhou Wen immediately came to a realization.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1112'>Chapter 1112: It’s to Let You Die</h3>

<p>“You should worry about yourself first. You killed Di Tian’s Body Cleansing Stone clone. Do you think the monarchs of the Octokind will let you off?” Wang Mingyuan said.</p>
<p>“Body Cleansing Stone clone?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He imagined that he had killed the real Di Tian.</p>
<p>“When dimensional creatures descend onto Earth, they will be restricted by the rules. Di Tian was naturally no exception. Of course, it would have been impossible for him to descend with his true body. Therefore, he only descended with a Body Cleansing Stone clone. With the power of the Body Cleansing Stone, he could avoid the rejection of Earth’s rules and retain his Calamity-grade strength,” Wang Mingyuan said.</p>
<p>“Since it was only a clone and I didn’t obtain the Dimensional Wheel, is there a need to use all means to kill me?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>“If you had only killed the Body Cleansing Stone clone, they wouldn’t have to insist on killing you. But since you killed Di Tian, things are naturally different.” Wang Mingyuan’s words left Zhou Wen somewhat confused.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that I only killed the Body Cleansing Stone clone?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“It’s true you only killed the Body Cleansing Stone clone, but Di Tian’s true body has already been simultaneously killed by me. Unfortunately, no one knows that I was the one who killed him. They will naturally think that you used some kind of power to kill the true body when you killed the clone. After all, the power displayed by your sword was so powerful. Even the monarchs of the various races will probably think so,” Wang Mingyuan said casually.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately rendered speechless as he looked at Wang Mingyuan, at a loss for words.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Furthermore, even without the matter regarding Di Tian, humans like you are already enough to influence the plans of the dimension’s monarchs. They definitely won’t let you off. If they know that you advanced to the Mythical stage with a human body, they will be bent on killing you. There will be more than one Apocalypse-grade powerhouse who wants to kill you. Even if you were on Earth, you probably wouldn’t be able to live comfortably,” Wang Mingyuan added.</p>
<p>“They probably won’t recognize me, right?” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and realized that he hadn’t exposed his identity.</p>
<p>“Finding you isn’t as difficult as you imagine. For example, there’s a monarch in the dimension who’s proficient in the art of the Heavenly Eye. He can see through the karma that has already happened. Furthermore, you were only wearing a helmet. As long as he personally enters Earth, it will be easy for him to find you.”</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan paused for a moment before saying, “Even if that monarch doesn’t come personally, there are plenty of Calamity-grade creatures with similar abilities. Although they aren’t as strong as that monarch, it won’t be difficult to figure out your identity.”</p>
<p>“Teacher, do you have a solution?” Zhou Wen knew that if Wang Mingyuan didn’t have a solution, he wouldn’t waste his time talking to him.</p>
<p>“I’ve already thought of a solution for you,” Wang Mingyuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Zhou Wen asked in delight.</p>
<p>“It’s to let you die.” With that said, Wang Mingyuan pressed down on Zhou Wen’s head with all his might. Before Zhou Wen could react, he felt his vision turn black as he immediately lost consciousness.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The battle between Zhou Wen and Di Tian had a huge impact on the Federation and even overseas.</p>
<p>People were guessing the origins of Human and who it was.</p>
<p>They made all sorts of guesses. Some people even guessed that Human might be a real human and not a half-human who had fused with a Guardian. Otherwise, why would he be named Human?</p>
<p>Human was a miracle to begin with. It wouldn’t be surprising if there were more miracles. Why couldn’t he be a pure human?</p>
<p>However, another group of people believed that Human couldn’t be pure human. After all, pure humans couldn’t advance to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Both sides held their own views and kept arguing. No one could convince the other.</p>
<p>However, there was one thing that everyone acknowledged. Human’s contributions to humanity were indelible.</p>
<p>The most famous self-media, Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau, even called Zhou Wen by the name of Human Sovereign.</p>
<p>Of course, this was because the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau was a supporter of the theory that Human Sovereign was pure human.</p>
<p>And the reason why they used the word ‘Sovereign’ was because the dimension had called first place ‘King of Earth.’ Using the word ‘Sovereign’ instead of ‘King’ meant that they didn’t acknowledge the so-called King of Earth.</p>
<p>There had been no King of Earth in the past, nor would there be in the future. There would only be a sovereign of humanity.</p>
<p>Even if there were cube ranking battles in the future and a new King of Earth was to be chosen, humans wouldn’t acknowledge it. The only person acknowledged was Human Sovereign.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether Human Sovereign was half-human or whether he agreed with this title, the various media outlets started using this title, and it was gradually acknowledged after people got used to it.</p>
<p>Everyone kept arguing about everything regarding Human Sovereign, but they never came to a conclusion.</p>
<p>As for the strike that Zhou Wen had used to kill Di Tian, it was also a compulsory lesson for the various human colleges. Many colleges even had statues of Zhou Wen drawing his sword and slashing at the sky.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally didn’t know any of this. This was because when he woke up, he realized that his vision was pitch-black. Furthermore, he couldn’t move his body at all. It was as though he had been imprisoned by something. He couldn’t even move his fingers.</p>
<p>What happened? Where am I? Zhou Wen was puzzled as he slowly recalled what had happened. He knew that Wang Mingyuan had knocked him unconscious.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what Wang Mingyuan was up to, nor did he know where he was. He didn’t even know if he was alive.</p>
<p>He attempted to summon his Companion Beasts, but he realized that none of them reacted as though all of them had vanished.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy seemed to circulate normally again. He could even draw different Essence Energy Arts on the Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>The various Essence Energy Arts were normal, but he couldn’t move. It was as though he was sealed in infinite darkness.</p>
<p>Time ticked by. With Zhou Wen’s ability, it wasn’t difficult for him to calculate the time even without a watch. As time passed, he realized that he didn’t feel hungry at all.</p>
<p>Mythical bodies were very powerful, but no matter how powerful they were, it was impossible for them to not eat or drink. Zhou Wen had already kept track of time for more than a month, but he didn’t feel hungry at all. This was extremely abnormal.</p>
<p>Could it be that I’m really dead? Zhou Wen was very puzzled. Apart from being dead, he really couldn’t figure out why he didn’t feel hungry after such a long period of time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried many methods, but he couldn’t escape. Since he had nothing to do, he decided to constantly circulate the Lost Immortal Sutra and draw all sorts of Essence Energy Arts to comprehend the profundity within.</p>
<p>After experiencing the matter of a scripture appearing for the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, Zhou Wen could engrave the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder together with the scriptures.</p>
<p>This allowed the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder to be maintained for a much longer period of time. As for the other Essence Energy Arts that were engraved, the duration was still very short.</p>
<p>Since Zhou Wen had nothing to do, he constantly studied carving. As his insights deepened, his carving speed increased.</p>
<p>Many times, Zhou Wen felt that he was dead or that he was just dreaming. According to his calculations, more than a year had passed, but he still didn’t feel hungry.</p>

<h3 id='chapter1113'>Chapter 1113: Mount Fangzhang</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Mount Fangzhang… Could this be the legendary Mount Fangzhang…” A woman stood on the back of a huge sea turtle, her eyes staring straight ahead as her voice trembled.</p>
<p>Not far from the sea turtle was an island with a mountain on it.</p>
<p>The island and mountain didn’t look very big, but for some reason, they couldn’t see the top of the mountain. The mountain passed through the clouds as though there was no end.</p>
<p>The sea turtle quickly approached the island. The woman jumped off the sea turtle’s back and happily climbed up the mountain.</p>
<p>The woman wasn’t old. At most, she looked about seventeen or eighteen years old. She looked rather delicate and pretty. She crawled up the mountain with her hands and feet.</p>
<p>Mount Fangzhang was one of the three legendary immortal mountains. In the past, the First Emperor of Qin had sent people out to sea to search for the Elixir of Immortality. Their main search was for Mount Fangzhang.</p>
<p>Among the three immortal mountains overseas, it was said that immortal grass and spirit herbs were everywhere on Penglai Mountain. So why wasn’t the First Emperor of Qin looking for Penglai Mountain, but Mount Fangzhang that wasn’t famous for immortal herbs and spirit herbs?</p>
<p>This was because it was said that the top of Mount Fangzhang was where immortals lived. Furthermore, the word “Fangzhang” didn’t refer to a monk, but a pill chamber.</p>
<p>Therefore, the First Emperor of Qin wanted the Elixir of Immortality, not the immortal grass and spirit herbs from Penglai Mountain, but the finished elixir refined by immortals.</p>
<p>If one erroneously ate the wrong immortal grass and spirit herbs, not only would they not gain immortality, but they might even lose their lives. If one really wanted to become immortal, they had to obtain the pills refined by immortals.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing was only seventeen this year. She was still in her youth and wasn’t at the age to worry about longevity.</p>
<p>The reason she had come to Mount Fangzhang wasn’t because she had taken the initiative to search for the immortal mountain, nor was it because she wanted to live forever.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing’s appearance here was completely an accident. She was originally from the Federation, but not long ago, she had been captured by the overseas faction. It could be considered a kidnapping.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Ji Moqing was smart and had Companion Beasts that could be used at sea. Furthermore, she looked young and weak, so people weren’t wary of her. This had given her an opportunity to escape.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing now regretted escaping. This was because she had already been out at sea for nearly half a month. Although no one had caught up to her, she didn’t know how to navigate at all, much less where to go to reach land. Therefore, in this half a month, Ji Moqing hadn’t even drunk a drop of water. If this continued, she would definitely die of thirst.</p>
<p>She was so excited to see Mount Fangzhang not because she felt that she could find the Elixir of Immortality, but because she felt that she might find water and food here.</p>
<p>However, Ji Moqing was quickly disappointed. This place, which was suspected to be the legendary Mount Fangzhang, was completely bare. There was not even a single weed, much less water.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing refused to give up. She wanted to climb to the top of the mountain to take a look. Even if there was no water source, eating an immortal pill if it existed would be of some use.</p>
<p>However, after climbing for a long time, to the point of making her hands bleed, Ji Moqing looked up and saw the peak that seemed to extend infinitely as though there was no end to it.</p>
<p>What f*cked-up mountain is this? I’ve been climbing for so long. I should have reached the top long ago. Why can’t I see the end of it? Ji Moqing was puzzled, but she knew that it was too late for regrets.</p>
<p>Her body would no longer allow her to go to other islands to find water sources, so Ji Moqing could only pin her hopes of reaching the top of Mount Fangzhang before she died of thirst. She wanted to see if there was any Elixir of Immortality that could quench her thirst.</p>
<p>Even if there was no Elixir of Immortality, it was fine to find some water. Ji Moqing didn’t ask for much.</p>
<p>However, after Ji Moqing climbed for a long time, the mountain still didn’t seem to have a top. No matter how hard she climbed, she couldn’t reach the top.</p>
<p>I can’t take it anymore. I really can’t crawl anymore. I might as well die of thirst. Ji Moqing crawled to a protruding part of a mountain rock and sat on it, panting heavily. Now, she didn’t have any strength left.</p>
<p>She also knew that if this was really Mount Fangzhang, there was definitely something odd about it. It was impossible for her to easily climb to the top.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing’s desire to live was very strong. She had only said those words in a fit of anger. When she sat there to rest, her eyes were still sizing up her surroundings, hoping to find a way to scale Mount Fangzhang.</p>
<p>After watching for a while, Ji Moqing’s eyes suddenly lit up as though she had discovered something.</p>
<p>The mountain was extremely steep, and there were no obvious protrusions on the mountain wall. Only the spot where she was sitting had such a stone protruding out. Furthermore, the texture of the stone was somewhat odd.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing observed carefully and realized that the protruding rock was not fundamentally different from the rocks on the mountain wall beside it.</p>
<p>Although the stone was the same, Ji Moqing realized that the texture of the stone did not match the texture of the stone beside it.</p>
<p>If such a steep mountain wall had a crack, it should have fallen very quickly. This protruding rock didn’t fall, but its texture doesn’t match the nearby rock patterns. There must be something wrong with it. The more Ji Moqing thought about it, the more she felt that she was right. She seemed to gain some strength in her body as she summoned a companion short sword. Then, she grabbed the short sword and used the tip of the sword to dig out the spot where the rock connected to the mountain wall.</p>
<p>She slowly dug out a space in the rocks. These rocks didn’t seem to be as hard as she imagined. They were easily dug out by her short sword.</p>
<p>Strange. Even if this isn’t Mount Fangzhang, it should be a dimensional zone. Logically speaking, it shouldn’t be so easy to dig through it. After all, this is only a Mortal Companion Beast sword… Ji Moqing thought to herself as she continued digging with the short sword in her hand.</p>
<p>She was just too tired and didn’t have much strength left. To be able to last until now was testament to her extremely strong desire to live.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Suddenly, when Ji Moqing dug down again, the short sword seemed to touch something and snapped.</p>
<p>On a careful look, a blade-like object was revealed in the dug up rock. Her short sword had been snapped by the blade.</p>
<p>What a loss. Ji Moqing was somewhat depressed. Although her Companion Beast, the short sword, was only at the Mortal stage, a Mortal Companion Beast was sometimes more expensive than an Epic Companion Beast. This Companion Beast had been bought by her family for a large sum of money, but now, it had snapped.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing touched the blade embedded in the rock and felt an extremely cold feeling, as though it was made of cold metal. However, only a part of the blade was revealed.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing extended her fingers and carefully pinched the sides of the blade before shaking it. To her surprise, this shake made the blade move.</p>
<p>She carefully rocked it as she drew it out. After a while, she finally drew out the sharp blade. Ji Moqing immediately realized that it was a saber. It had a straight blade. The blade was cold and looked like it was made of Essence Gold.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1114'>Chapter 1114: Escaping</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Why is there an Essence Gold weapon here? Who hid it here? Ji Moqing brandished the Essence Gold saber twice and felt that it was extremely sharp. With a thought, she continued digging in with the Essence Gold saber.</p>
<p>This Essence Gold saber was much better than her short sword. Soon, it dug through the hole.</p>
<p>Before long, the tip of the Essence Gold Saber dug into something with a clang.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing hurriedly retracted the Essence Gold saber and looked in the direction where the tip of the saber had just stabbed. She saw that there was actually a piece of metal exposed from the rock.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing followed the exposed part of the metal and dug out the rocks beside it. Soon, she realized that it was a bamboo-shaped scabbard.</p>
<p>She took out the scabbard and inserted the Essence Gold saber into it. It matched seamlessly. Clearly, this was a set to begin with.</p>
<p>“This Essence Gold saber’s forging standards are extremely high. It might even be the best Essence Gold weapon now. And this saber looks like it must have been used for many years…” Ji Moqing held the Bamboo Blade and carefully sized it up.</p>
<p>However, she didn’t know that the moment the Bamboo Blade returned to the scabbard, some ephemeral object hidden in the scabbard had been severed. And on the mountaintop of Mount Fangzhang, some strange changes ensued.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was trapped in the strange area as he silently counted the days.</p>
<p>He originally imagined that Wang Mingyuan was definitely trying to use the method of faking his death to fool the monarchs of the dimension. After everything was over, he would release him.</p>
<p>However, no matter how long Zhou Wen waited, Wang Mingyuan didn’t appear to rescue him.</p>
<p>If it were any ordinary person, they would probably go crazy after the solitary confinement. After all, this place was just too lonely.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen endured it. He tried all sorts of methods to escape while he constantly studied and engraved the other Essence Energy Arts.</p>
<p>Time passed slowly. In the beginning, Zhou Wen could only draw one Life Soul. Then he could draw two at the same time. Finally, he could draw several Life Souls at the same time.</p>
<p>However, such success wasn’t a coincidence. This was because according to Zhou Wen’s calculations, he had been trapped here for nearly ten years, but Wang Mingyuan had not come to save him.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Could Teacher have encountered some trouble? Or could it be that the dimensional monarchs discovered that he had killed Di Tian and captured him? Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Time continued to pass as Zhou Wen constantly meditated every day. His comprehension of the other eight Essence Energy Arts had already sublimated. With a thought, he could carve a Life Soul on the Wheel of Destiny. He could even carve several Life Souls at the same time.</p>
<p>However, according to Zhou Wen’s count, he had been here for no less than twenty years.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>At that moment, he no longer had any hopes of Wang Mingyuan coming back to save him. He could only rely on himself to escape his current predicament.</p>
<p>He could only work on his Essence Energy Art, hoping that he could successfully escape one day.</p>
<p>Time passed in a flash. According to Zhou Wen’s count, he had been here for more than a hundred years, and to this day, he had failed to escape.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued cultivating like before, but he suddenly heard a click as though a lock had opened.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised to discover that his body was gradually able to move. He could now clearly sense the body he couldn’t sense previously.</p>
<p>He controlled his body and struggled with all his might. Then, his body touched something. Then, a ray of light shone in through the crack, illuminating his face.</p>
<p>Finally… Zhou Wen was so excited that he couldn’t speak. He pushed with all his might again, causing the crack to widen. Then, he heard the sound of rocks falling to the ground.</p>
<p>Sunlight shone on Zhou Wen’s face, blinding him. All he could do was lower his head to size up what was trapping him.</p>
<p>With this glance, Zhou Wen was immediately stunned.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that the area trapping him was some narrow space.</p>
<p>However, what he saw now was a huge stone furnace. Such a huge stone furnace was enough for three people to sleep inside. For some reason, he hadn’t been able to move at all while lying inside.</p>
<p>After coming out of the stone furnace, Zhou Wen realized that everything about his body was normal. What was even stranger was that he was as young and strong as before. This left Zhou Wen in disbelief.</p>
<p>When he was trapped, his heart muscles had been silently calculating. It had indeed been more than a hundred years, but his body hadn’t aged. It was very strange.</p>
<p>Could it be that those hundred plus years were just a dream? Were they were all illusions? Zhou Wen felt that this explanation was a little unreliable.</p>
<p>If it was really a dream, then the things he had comprehended in the dream wouldn’t exist. However, Zhou Wen realized that everything he had comprehended whilst trapped was something he could do as he pleased. It was impossible for it to have been a dream.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Have I been trapped for more than a hundred years? Just as Zhou Wen was feeling puzzled, he suddenly heard knocking coming from the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>Although the sound was very far away, Zhou Wen heard it very clearly as though it was ringing in his ears.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen subconsciously touched his ear and was immediately overjoyed because he had touched the earring that Truth Listener had transformed into.</p>
<p>Truth Listener is still by my side and has reestablished a connection with me. This is great… Zhou Wen hurriedly checked his other Companion Beasts and realized that they were all there. Even Demonic Neonate, who had expended all her strength, had returned to normal. This made him certain that the past hundred years were definitely not a dream.</p>
<p>My phone… Only then did Zhou Wen recall the problem with his phone. He touched his body, but he didn’t find it. Looking down, he realized that there was a package in the stone furnace. Many of Zhou Wen’s things were inside, including the mysterious phone.</p>
<p>He switched on his phone and entered some dungeons. Seeing that there was nothing wrong with those dungeons, he was completely relieved.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I have to ask someone. Zhou Wen had already heard Ji Moqing digging the mountainside.</p>
<p>However, before he could ask Ji Moqing any questions, a few people landed on the island and quickly arrived in front of the mountain. They discovered Ji Moqing halfway up the mountain.</p>
<p>They quickly caught up to her, scaring Ji Moqing so much that she tried her best to climb up. This was because she had already recognized that one of them was the person who had captured her overseas.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing struggled to climb upwards, but she didn’t have much strength left. Soon, she was surrounded by them against a mountain wall.</p>
<p>“Ji Moqing oh Ji Moqing, I really have to thank you for escaping. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have been able to see the legendary Mount Fangzhang,” the leader said with a laugh.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1115'>Chapter 1115: Master Human Sovereign</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen packed up his things and placed the Immortal Culling Sword back into the Chaos Bead. After checking the area, he realized that all the important things were there. He hadn’t lost anything. Even the Mourning Stick was there.</p>
<p>The only thing missing was the Bamboo Blade, which was now in Ji Moqing’s hand.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing was climbing up the mountain with all her might. The people below were chasing after her. Ji Moqing looked like she was only at the Mortal stage, so her speed was not as fast as the others. She was about to be caught.</p>
<p>One of the pursuers released an eagle-type Companion Beast to grab Ji Moqing from the air, but just as the eagle-type Companion Beast flew into the air, a bolt of lightning appeared out of thin air and instantly charred the eagle.</p>
<p>This gave everyone a fright, but they quickly realized the problem. They didn’t dare summon any more flying Companion Beasts and only climbed up the mountain wall to chase after Ji Moqing.</p>
<p>No more lightning appeared as a result. Soon, they caught up to Ji Moqing. The man at the top reached out to grab her feet.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing held onto a crack in the mountain wall with one hand and slashed at the person’s hand with the Bamboo Blade with the other.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, she was too weak and too slow. The man casually grabbed the blade of the Bamboo Blade and pulled Ji Moqing down, clamping her under his armpit.</p>
<p>“Let go of me. Do you know what you’re doing? You’ll regret what you’ve done,” Ji Moqing said as she struggled.</p>
<p>However, she was too weak, and the man was an Epic expert. He didn’t mind her punches and kicks; Ji Moqing couldn’t injure him at all.</p>
<p>“Miss Ji, of course I know what I’m doing, and I definitely won’t regret it.” The man smiled and continued, “If you think that the person in your family can save you, you are gravely mistaken. Ignoring the fact that he doesn’t know you are here, even if he knows, he won’t be able to save you. On land, he can be said to be invincible, but out at sea, even if he really is a god that descended to the mortal world, he will drown.”</p>
<p>“Who said I’m counting on Brother-in-law to save me? I’m not talking about him,” Ji Moqing said.</p>
<p>“If you aren’t counting on him, who else can you count on? Your father? You can’t count on him either. He has gone to the South District and hasn’t returned yet. He might not even know that you have gone missing,” the man said again.</p>
<p>“Who said I’m counting on my father?” Ji Moqing pursed her lips.</p>
<p>“Oh, who else can you count on?” the man asked with a smile.</p>
<p>Of course, he knew very well that Ji Moqing had no one to rely on. The sea was not under the Federation. Even if the members of the six families came, they wouldn’t dare do much out at sea.</p>
<p>“I’m counting on this,” Ji Moqing said as she pointed at the Bamboo Blade in the man’s hand.</p>
<p>“Counting on it? Do you mean that this saber will kill me? Or do you want me to return it to you and then extend my neck for you to kill me?” The man’s words made everyone laugh.</p>
<p>However, Ji Moqing did not laugh. With a serious expression, she said, “Don’t you find it strange? Why do I have this saber?”</p>
<p>“What’s so strange about that… No… This is an Essence Gold saber, not a Companion Beast weapon. You didn’t bring a weapon with you. There’s no place to find a weapon in this vast sea. Could it be that this saber belongs to Mount Fangzhang?” The man immediately thought of something amiss as he looked at the Bamboo Blade in his hand with a strange look.</p>
<p>“Wu Zonglie, you are a reputable figure in the overseas alliance after all. Furthermore, you are Martial Fanatic. From the looks of it, you are just boasting. I never expected you to be so stupid. I think you should stop calling yourself Martial Fanatic. Just call yourself Martial Idiot or Martial Fool…” Ji Moqing said.</p>
<p>Wu Zonglie said coldly, “Don’t think that we won’t dare to do anything to you just because we want to use you to threaten your brother-in-law. Believe it or not, if you spout any more nonsense, I’ll chop off one of your hands. Having one hand missing won’t affect anything.”</p>
<p>However, Ji Moqing wasn’t afraid at all. She even said plausibly, “Is there anything wrong? When have you seen an Essence Gold weapon in a dimensional zone? Or do you think a dimensional creature will forge an Essence Gold saber in a place like Mount Fangzhang?”</p>
<p>“That makes sense.” Wu Zonglie frowned slightly when he heard that. He looked at Ji Moqing and said, “Where did you get this Essence Gold saber?”</p>
<p>“Someone naturally gave it to me,” Ji Moqing said.</p>
<p>“Who?” Wu Zonglie and company sized up their surroundings. Ji Moqing was right. Since there was an Essence Gold saber here, it meant that someone was here.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I’ll scare you if I tell you the truth. You’d better obediently return the saber to me and kowtow to me respectfully to beg for my forgiveness. When the owner of the saber comes, I can even put in a few good words for you so that he can spare your lives,” Ji Moqing said seriously.</p>
<p>“It’s not that I’m bragging, but there’s no one in this world worthy of me, Wu Zonglie, kneeling and begging for mercy. Furthermore, out in the sea, even if there’s someone here, they are from our overseas alliance. Why would anyone save you?” Wu Zonglie scoffed.</p>
<p>“What if this person isn’t from the overseas alliance?” Ji Moqing asked.</p>
<p>“Even better. If those fellows from the Federation dared to come to the sea, I would let them know the glory of us powerhouses out at sea,” said Wu Zonglie.</p>
<p>“You mean to say that you want to compete with Human Sovereign?” Ji Moqing sneered.</p>
<p>“Human Sovereign?” Wu Zonglie and company were alarmed.</p>
<p>“That’s right. It’s His Excellency, Human Sovereign. When he passed by this place, he saw that I had an extraordinary physique and was smart, kind, adorable, and extremely talented. Therefore, he took me in as his disciple and even gave me the saber to protect myself.” Ji Moqing spoke without blinking, as though she was speaking the truth.</p>
<p>“Do you think I will believe you? If it’s really as you say, why wouldn’t Human Sovereign come to save you? Why would you have to come up with so many lies?” Wu Zonglie said disdainfully.</p>
<p>The last time Ji Moqing had escaped, it was because she had been so eloquent that she had managed to fool all of them. This had given her an opportunity to take advantage of.</p>
<p>This time, Wu Zonglie naturally wouldn’t believe her no matter what. Furthermore, ever since the ranking battle five years ago, Human Sovereign had not appeared again. In this vast sea, the chances of Ji Moqing meeting Human Sovereign were even lower than striking the lottery. How could there be such a coincidence?</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>“That’s something you wouldn’t know. Although my master is an unparalleled hero, he’s old after all. He’s not very good in some aspects…” Ji Moqing blinked and said.</p>
<p>The expressions of Wu Zonglie and company turned odd. Wu Zonglie sneered and said, “Did Human Sovereign tell you that?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. Men all care about their pride. How can he tell me these things? However, I heard from Master that there’s something wrong with his relationship with his wife. That’s why he came here to look for the Elixir of Immortality. That’s my guess…” Ji Moqing said.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter1116'>Chapter 1116: Niten Flying Immortal Palace</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>When Wu Zonglie and company heard her say that, they suddenly felt that it made sense.</p>
<p>Seeing that they seemed to believe her, Ji Moqing struck while the iron was hot and continued, “Now, my master has gone to the top of the mountain to get the Elixir of Immortality. When he comes down with the Elixir and doesn’t see me, you will be in trouble. Therefore, if you release me now and kneel down politely to apologize, I can even put in a few good words for you and spare your lives.”</p>
<p>However, Wu Zonglie didn’t believe her. He sneered and said, “Then shout. Get your Human Sovereign master to kill us.”</p>
<p>Ji Moqing was still too young after all. She complained in her heart. Wu Zonglie had suffered once, so it seemed like he didn’t believe her at all. It wouldn’t be easy to fool him again.</p>
<p>When Wu Zonglie saw Ji Moqing’s gaze, he knew that his guess was definitely right. He was delighted as he said with a smile, “Ignoring the fact that Human Sovereign can’t be here, even if he was, I would definitely make sure he doesn’t return. It’s good to know how powerful I, Martial Fanatic, am. Perhaps the two of you will kneel down and beg for mercy together.”</p>
<p>Wu Zonglie naturally said all this to vent his anger on Ji Moqing. He wasn’t really that arrogant.</p>
<p>The people beside him echoed, “Human Sovereign defeated Di Tian. Lord Martial Fanatic, if you defeat Human Sovereign, it will be a beautiful story of the new generation replacing the old. I believe Human Sovereign will be gratified.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen listened from the mountaintop for a long time. In the beginning, he didn’t know who the Human Sovereign they were talking about was. Only when he heard the last sentence did he suddenly realize that they were talking about him. He couldn’t help but be at a loss whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>When did I become Human Sovereign? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled. Furthermore, he wasn’t sure what era it was.</p>
<p>He had kept track of time himself when he was trapped. It felt like more than a hundred years had passed, but from the looks of it, it hadn’t been that long for these people.</p>
<p>At this point, Ji Moqing could only persist with her lie. She forced herself to calm down and said, “Aren’t you afraid that my master will destroy your Niten Flying Immortal Palace in a fit of anger?”</p>
<p>Wu Zonglie opened his mouth to say something, but he suddenly widened his eyes in horror.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Are you afraid now? Let go of me quickly. You might still have a chance of survival later…” As Ji Moqing spoke, she suddenly felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>This was because Wu Zonglie and company weren’t looking at her, but at the other side of the mountain wall.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing, who was sandwiched by Wu Zonglie, also looked up and was instantly alarmed. She saw a masked man standing at the protruding part of the mountain wall and looking over.</p>
<p>“Who did you say was to kneel and beg for mercy?” Zhou Wen wore the Moonlit Rabbit mask as he stared at Wu Zonglie and asked coldly.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Wu Zonglie thought to himself, How can there be such a coincidence? There hasn’t been any news of Human Sovereign for five years. To think that Ji Moqing would encounter Human Sovereign and be taken in as a disciple? It must be fake.</p>
<p>In fact, even Ji Moqing didn’t believe that Zhou Wen was Human Sovereign. She also knew that it couldn’t be such a coincidence.</p>
<p>With a thought, Ji Moqing deliberately shouted, “Master Human Sovereign, quickly save me. These bad people are bullying me.”</p>
<p>She believed that Zhou Wen was deliberately cooperating with her to act as Human Sovereign to save her, so she immediately cooperated.</p>
<p>Wu Zonglie sized up Zhou Wen and asked, “Are you really Human Sovereign?”</p>
<p>“No,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, Wu Zonglie secretly heaved a sigh of relief. Although he felt that Zhou Wen was definitely not Human Sovereign, he couldn’t help but have second thoughts. After all, this was indeed a coincidence: Zhou Wen had appeared when Ji Moqing said that Human Sovereign was here and he wore a mask that resembled the one Human Sovereign had worn in the video.</p>
<p>“Then are you standing up for her?” Wu Zonglie asked again.</p>
<p>“No.” Zhou Wen shook his head again.</p>
<p>Wu Zonglie and company couldn’t help but be taken aback. Ji Moqing also wore a look of surprise. She originally imagined that Zhou Wen had come out to save her, but his words left her dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“Then why are you here?” Wu Zonglie asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“That saber is mine.” Zhou Wen pointed at the Bamboo Blade in Wu Zonglie’s hand.</p>
<p>An idea came to Ji Moqing’s mind as she immediately shouted excitedly, “Master, I really didn’t lose your saber on purpose. They snatched it away by force. I’m too weak and can’t protect your saber. I don’t deserve to be your disciple…”</p>
<p>Wu Zonglie and company immediately looked at Zhou Wen warily. Although they didn’t believe that Zhou Wen was the true Human Sovereign, since he was the owner of the saber, it was possible that he was related to Ji Moqing. Otherwise, why would the saber be in Ji Moqing’s hands?</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Wu Zonglie stared at Zhou Wen and asked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to explain further to them. He tapped his foot on the mountain wall and flew towards Wu Zonglie, hoping to retrieve the Bamboo Blade.</p>
<p>When Wu Zonglie and company saw Zhou Wen approach, they immediately drew their swords to meet the enemy.</p>
<p>These people were using tachi swords, and they were dual wielding. The moment they used their saber moves, Zhou Wen immediately felt a sense of familiarity. There was a faint inkling of Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t purely Transcendent Flying Immortal. There was only an inkling of it. Zhou Wen seemed to have some impression of the other portion.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen recalled where he had seen similar moves.</p>
<p>Back when he was still schooling at Sunset College, Zhou Wen had once gamed in a stone pavilion in Peony Garden, but he had ended up encountering an old man and a young man. The youth had insisted on competing with him.</p>
<p>In the end, the elder fought Zhou Wen and even used a very special Essence Energy Art. Not only did he fail to defeat Zhou Wen, but he even helped him condense the Dao Sutra Life Soul.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t remember the names of the old and young duo, but he still remembered condensing a Life Soul and the concept of withering that the elder had used.</p>
<p>The two of them had seen him use Transcendent Flying Immortal, but back then, Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal wasn’t as mature as it was now.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder I felt that the concept of Transcendent Flying Immortal in their saber techniques wasn’t perfect. So that’s how it is. It’s probably because the old and young duo fused it into their saber techniques after seeing that move… Zhou Wen had roughly figured out the cause and effect.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t stop. He kept advancing and retreating amidst the saber beams of Wu Zonglie and company. By the time he retreated, the Bamboo Blade had already returned to his hand.</p>
<p>The expressions of Wu Zonglie and company changed drastically to nastiness. Regardless of whether the person in front of them was Human Sovereign, he was an extremely terrifying figure. At the very least, his movement techniques were not something they could match.</p>
<p>Wu Zonglie introduced himself, “We are disciples of the Sword Sage of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace. May I know who you are? Why are you making an enemy of us?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1117'>Chapter 1117: Meeting Honn Shinsakura Again</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“What’s the Sword Sage’s name?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>When Wu Zonglie and company heard this, their expressions turned nasty as though they had been greatly insulted.</p>
<p>“Out at sea, who doesn’t know the Sword Sage, Sei Gasakai of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace? Your Excellency, you are overseas, so how can you not know? Could it be that you are deliberately insulting us?” Wu Zonglie held his two sabers as though he wanted to fight Zhou Wen to the death.</p>
<p>“Sei Gasakai. Yes, that’s the name. That’s no mistake then.” Zhou Wen recalled that the elder’s name was indeed that.</p>
<p>Wu Zonglie and company didn’t know what Zhou Wen meant as they looked at him without saying a word.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and asked Wu Zonglie, “Since Sei Gasakai is known as Sword Sage, what’s his cultivation level now? Has he advanced to the Calamity grade?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen believed that he had been trapped for more than a hundred years. In these hundred years, it was impossible for humans to stay in their original spots. Experts like Jing Daoxian and Night Thearch might have long cracked the restriction that prevented humans from advancing to the Mythical stage. Perhaps there were Calamity-grade experts among humans.</p>
<p>Since Sei Gasakai had the lofty title of Sword Sage, it was highly likely that he had already advanced to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Wu Zonglie and company’s faces flushed red. Wu Zonglie even drew his sword and pointed it at Zhou Wen. He said angrily, “If you dare insult our master again, we won’t let you escape unscathed even if we have to die today.”</p>
<p>“When did I insult Sei Gasakai?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing hurriedly said, “Master, that Sword Sage, Sei Gasakai, only advanced to the Mythical stage with the help of a Guardian’s power. He’s still worlds apart from reaching the Terror grade, much less the Calamity grade.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense. My master is already half a step into the Terror stage. What do you mean worlds apart? You deserve death.” Wu Zonglie was furious when he heard Ji Moqing’s disrespect for Sei Gasakai. He raised his saber and slashed at Ji Moqing, wanting to kill her.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s figure suddenly advanced and retreated. Before Wu Zonglie could react, Ji Moqing had already been pulled away by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Leave,” Zhou Wen said to Wu Zonglie and company. He felt that it was tiring to speak to them. It was best to slowly ask the girl.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Wu Zonglie knew that he wasn’t Zhou Wen’s match. He gritted his teeth and left with his juniors.</p>
<p>After Wu Zonglie and company left, Zhou Wen carried Ji Moqing to the foot of the mountain. He placed her on the ground and asked, “Did you bring your phone?”</p>
<p>“They took everything away when they caught me.” Ji Moqing brushed away the soil on her buttocks and stood up to say to Zhou Wen, “Furthermore, even if i had a phone, there’s no signal here. It would be useless even if I had it.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t want his phone to go online, but to check the date to determine the time.</p>
<p>He had a nagging feeling that something was amiss. It was as though he hadn’t been trapped for a hundred years.</p>
<p>“Since they’re all gone, stop pretending. My brother-in-law sent you here, right? Where’s brother-in-law? He didn’t come himself, right?” Seeing Zhou Wen standing there motionless, Ji Moqing reached out to grab his mask. “Honn Shinsakura is definitely nearby. After they meet Honn Shinsakura, he will definitely be able to guess that you were sent by my brother-in-law. It’s useless to wear a mask. Quickly take it off. It makes me uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen dodged slightly, but he still took off his mask.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing couldn’t help but be taken aback when she saw Zhou Wen’s face. Then, she sized him up and said, “I never expected you to be so powerful at such a young age. As expected of my brother-in-law’s man.”</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, Ji Moqing pulled Zhou Wen and ran towards the beach. “Let’s not talk about this now. Let’s leave quickly. When Wu Zonglie finds Honn Shinsakura, we’ll be in trouble.”</p>
<p>However, after taking a few steps, Ji Moqing’s legs went limp and she nearly fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing hadn’t eaten or drunk for more than ten days. After such a long time, she was already at her limits.</p>
<p>“Did you bring any food or water?” Ji Moqing asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took out a packet of biscuits and a bottle of water from the Chaos Bead and handed them to her. Thankfully, the time and space in the chaos space were different from the outside world. Food didn’t go bad.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing opened the bottle and poured water into her mouth. Then, she stuffed the biscuits into her mouth. As she stuffed them into her mouth, she walked towards the beach. She said in a daze, “Let’s… leave quickly… Don’t let them… catch up…”</p>
<p>“It’s probably too late to leave now,” Zhou Wen said as he looked into the distance.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing looked up and saw a huge whale swimming over from the distant sea.</p>
<p>Wu Zonglie and company were standing on the back of the whale, but the person in the lead wasn’t Wu Zonglie. Instead, it was a young man in a white sword outfit.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>“It’s over, it’s over. Honn Shinsakura actually came so quickly. I can’t escape. Leave quickly. Go back and tell my brother-in-law that there’s no need to worry about me. I have a way to escape and get him to not go to the Niten Flying Immortal Palace.” Ji Moqing pushed Zhou Wen, indicating for him to leave quickly.</p>
<p>On the whale’s back, they also saw Zhou Wen. Wu Zonglie pointed at him and said, “Senior Brother Shinsakura, it’s that punk who disguised himself as Human Sovereign and snatched Ji Moqing away. It’s useless even if he takes off his mask. He hasn’t changed his clothes. He can’t be mistaken.”</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura’s gaze landed on Zhou Wen. When he saw Zhou Wen’s face, his body involuntarily trembled as his eyes turned odd.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Senior Brother Shinsakura, that punk even insulted Master. You have to tear him to pieces. You can’t let him die too easily,” shouted Wu Zonglie and company.</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura didn’t say a word as he stared intently at Zhou Wen with mixed feelings.</p>
<p>Back then, he had still been a youth who believed himself to be a genius. He had believed that his talent was top-notch and that no one his age could match him.</p>
<p>However, he had met Zhou Wen that year. Even now, Honn Shinsakura couldn’t forget their meeting—he would never forget it for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>“I told you to leave. Why are you still standing here?” Ji Moqing couldn’t help but panic when she saw Zhou Wen standing still.</p>
<p>However, Ji Moqing quickly realized that it was too late. Honn Shinsakura had already arrived on the island with Wu Zonglie and company.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing knew how powerful Honn Shinsakura was. Although they were nominally disciples of Sword Sage Sei Gasakai, Wu Zonglie and company were in fact only in-name disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace, while Honn Shinsakura was Sei Gasakai’s personal disciple. Furthermore, he was the one with the highest achievements.</p>
<p>Therefore, despite being much older than Honn Shinsakura, Wu Zonglie addressed him as Senior Brother Honn Shinsakura.</p>
<p>Legend had it that Honn Shinsakura’s achievements in the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū were almost comparable to Sei Gasakai’s. He was an extremely famous young expert overseas.</p>
<p>“Punk, let’s see if you still dare to act mysterious this time… Senior Brother Shinsakura, it’s him…” As Wu Zonglie spoke, he turned to look at Honn Shinsakura, but he was petrified.</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura held his two sabers with both hands before kneeling down and bowing in front of Zhou Wen. This was an honorable bow that disciples used to pay respect to their masters. In the Niten Flying Immortal Palace, only Sei Gasakai could receive such a bow from Honn Shinsakura.</p>
<p>2</p>
<h3 id='chapter1118'>Chapter 1118: Changes in Five Years</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Ji Moqing looked at Honn Shinsakura and Zhou Wen in shock, almost unable to believe her eyes.</p>
<p>Wu Zonglie and company were dumbfounded, completely petrified.</p>
<p>After Honn Shinsakura bowed, he stood up with his sword in hand and said, “My master has repeatedly exhorted me to bow as a disciple if I see you again.”</p>
<p>“I’m surprised that you still remember me.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.</p>
<p>When Ji Moqing heard their conversation, she felt as though she had been struck by lightning. She immediately understood everything and could not help but retreat.</p>
<p>She had already realized that Zhou Wen hadn’t been sent by her brother-in-law. It was even very likely that he was a famous overseas devil. Otherwise, why would a person like Honn Shinsakura bow so respectfully to him and even say that the Sword Sage had instructed him to bow as a disciple?</p>
<p>Even the Sword Sage, Sei Gasakai, held him in such high esteem. He was definitely not as simple as he looked on the surface. Under his young appearance, he was very likely an old devil that had eternal youth.</p>
<p>After figuring everything out, Ji Moqing retreated, wanting to escape immediately.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t chase after her, nor did he speak. Honn Shinsakura didn’t get anyone to chase after her either. Ji Moqing summoned the Sea Turtle Companion Beast and quickly left the island.</p>
<p>“Sir, should we bring her back?” Honn Shinsakura asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Why do you want her captured?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura recounted the entire story. It involved a lot of information that Zhou Wen was eager to know. Furthermore, many things were different from what Zhou Wen had imagined.</p>
<p>Now, only about five years had passed since his battle with Di Tian. It was far from the hundred-plus years that Zhou Wen had counted.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was certain that he had been trapped for more than a hundred years. After all, enduring such a long period of imprisonment wasn’t an easy task.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had a firm will. An ordinary person would probably have suffered mental problems even if they hadn’t starved to death.</p>
<p>Although there was nothing wrong with Zhou Wen’s mind, he had spent a large amount of time practicing all sorts of Essence Energy Arts over the past hundred years. They were benefits that were as real as they could be. Furthermore, they had been built up over time. They couldn’t be faked.</p>
<p>Since it was true that Zhou Wen had been imprisoned for a hundred years and that only five years had passed in reality, there was only one possibility. Wang Mingyuan had used some kind of power to change time to achieve such an effect.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen hadn’t starved to death in the past five years. That was strange.</p>
<p>Although using five years to exchange for a hundred years seemed like a huge gain, the feeling of being imprisoned for a hundred years was almost maddening.</p>
<p>Even if Zhou Wen could focus on studying the Essence Energy Arts and try his best not to think too much, there were still a few times when he nearly had a mental breakdown.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen really didn’t know if he should thank Wang Mingyuan or beat him up to vent his anger.</p>
<p>Over the past five years, Earth had undergone tremendous changes. It was different from what Zhou Wen had imagined. The Guardians had failed to occupy Earth, much less become its owners.</p>
<p>Of course, the current owner of Earth wasn’t humanity either. In fact, the situation of humans was even worse than five years ago.</p>
<p>Earth was still undergoing constant changes. As more and more dimensional zones suffered breakouts, the space that humans could survive in became smaller and smaller.</p>
<p>Now, the living environment of humans was the opposite of before. In the past, humans wouldn’t be in danger as long as they didn’t enter dimensional zones. There were only a few dimensional creatures that could break out.</p>
<p>However, it was completely different now. If humans didn’t enter dimensional zones, the chances of survival were much lower.</p>
<p>Earth was filled with dimensional creatures that could break through the restrictions. There was no lack of Mythical and even Terror-grade existences. Even Calamity-grade dimensional creatures occasionally appeared.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Humans could only enter dimensional zones and use the dimensional zones’ rejection of alien, break-out dimensional creatures. Only then could they live an abject existence.</p>
<p>The dimensional zones that humans had previously viewed as a forbidden zone of death had now become humanity’s final refuge.</p>
<p>Of course, the dangers in dimensional zones still existed, but as long as one was familiar with the dangers, they could effectively avoid them. Many humans had already established human factions in various dimensional zones.</p>
<p>In such a harsh environment, the Federation surprisingly didn’t completely perish. However, the Federation was different from before. It was no longer an era where the six families controlled everything.</p>
<p>Up to now, no pure-blooded human had relied on their own strength to break through to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>And now, the common way to advance to the Mythical stage was still to contract with Guardians. Absorbing and fusing Guardians was still a very rare way to advance. This was because this advancement method had very high requirements for humans. Not everyone had the ability to fuse with Guardians.</p>
<p>However, another relatively more mature advancement method had appeared two years ago. It was to extract energy from the bodies of dimensional creatures to strengthen human bodies to achieve the goal of advancing to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>However, this method also had many problems. For example, a Mythical creature could only be used to create a single Mythical Serum. A single Mythical Serum could only be provided for one person. As for whether this person could advance to the Mythical stage with the help of the Mythical Serum, it depended on many factors. The overall success rate was only a few percent. Furthermore, if they failed, there would be many side effects. They might even instantly die.</p>
<p>Even if the person succeeded, their Life Providence, Life Soul, and Wheel of Destiny would be affected by the Mythical creatures.</p>
<p>In other words, the strength of the Mythical creatures used to create the Mythical Serum determined the strength of this person after advancing to the Mythical stage. It also determined the possibility of them advancing further in the future.</p>
<p>Furthermore, just like fusing with a Guardian, the genes of humans would mutate. Their appearance would be somewhat different from ordinary humans, and some would even completely beastify.</p>
<p>As for whether there would be other latent dangers in the future, it was still unknown.</p>
<p>However, up to now, most of the Mythical powerhouses among humans had used this method to advance. Now, a large portion of the Federation’s system relied on the Mythical Serum. As for the faction that controlled the Mythical Serum, it was now the actual ruler of the Senate.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen heard the name of the creator of the Mythical Serum, his expression couldn’t help but turn odd.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng… Federation President… Zhou Wen repeated the name silently. To him, this was a memory from a hundred years ago, so he found it somewhat unfamiliar. Furthermore, the two terms together sounded even more unfamiliar.</p>
<p>Heavens… What happened in the past five years… Zhou Wen snapped to his senses and groaned inwardly.</p>
<p>What surprised Zhou Wen wasn’t just that the changes in the past five years had been too drastic, but he wished he could immediately return to land and see how his family and friends were doing.</p>
<p>However, from what he gathered from Honn Shinsakura , the An family still resided in Luoyang. Not only had it not declined, but it had also become stronger.</p>
<p>The An family ran quite a number of dimensional zones in Luoyang and had taken in many refugees who had fled to Luoyang. They were now considered one of the few major factions in the East District. Even the people from the Senate were somewhat afraid of the An family.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1119'>Chapter 1119: Fuji Island</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen got Honn Shinsakura to capture Ji Moqing before following him to the Niten Flying Immortal Palace.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Zhou Wen didn’t wish to return to Luoyang immediately, but what was about to happen overseas had piqued his interest.</p>
<p>The reason Honn Shinsakura had wanted to capture Ji Moqing was because he wanted to obtain the help of someone in Ji Moqing’s family. The ability and Companion Beast that person had might be able to help the Niten Flying Immortal Palace tide through a calamity.</p>
<p>Now, Earth’s anomalies were extremely intense. There were terrifying dimensional creatures everywhere. Occasionally, they would encounter existences at the Terror grade. Many people died without knowing how.</p>
<p>The only refuge for humans was the dimensional zones that had been previously occupied by dimensional creatures. Under normal circumstances, dimensional creatures that weren’t from the corresponding dimensional zone would find it difficult to enter. Or rather, some force restrained dimensional creatures, preventing them from entering dimensional zones that didn’t belong to them.</p>
<p>However, such a situation would lose its effect in one circumstance—dimensional creatures could enter different dimensional zones without any scruples. That would be humanity’s greatest disaster whenever it happened.</p>
<p>Based on the research done over the past few years, there weren’t many possibilities for such a situation to happen. Most of it was due to the descent of a Calamity creature.</p>
<p>Every Calamity creature that descended would trigger a large number of dimensional creatures to go berserk. Humans suffered heavy losses every single time.</p>
<p>Now, there were signs of a Calamity creature’s descent overseas. Once a Calamity creature truly descended, the dimensional zones would no longer be able to protect humans. Humans had to directly face the dimensional creature tide that accompanied the Calamity creature.</p>
<p>The reason why humans hadn’t been wiped out in all the disasters wasn’t because humans were powerful. Part of it was because humans had tenacious vitality, but the most important reason was that the Calamity creatures had no intention of destroying Earth and humanity.</p>
<p>Or rather, humans were nothing to them. Not long after every Calamity creature descended, they would rush out of Earth and disappear. This was the biggest reason why humans had survived until today.</p>
<p>If those Calamity creatures really wanted to destroy humanity, humanity would have long ceased to exist in this world.</p>
<p>Even the Guardians who had advanced to the Terror grade were unable to fight against the Calamity creatures born on Earth. The King of Earth created by the dimension looked like a joke now.</p>
<p>The Niten Flying Immortal Palace didn’t plan on fighting the Calamity creature. They only hoped to survive the terrifying calamity and minimize the losses.</p>
<p>As for the Calamity creature this time, there was something special about it. The dimensional creature tides it triggered all had extreme Yin attributes.</p>
<p>Therefore, Honn Shinsakura wanted to use the power of extreme Yang to protect the foundation of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing’s brother-in-law, Fang Mingsu, had an extreme Yang-elemental Guardian and Companion Beast. Therefore, Honn Shinsakura had captured Ji Moqing and wanted to use her to threaten Fang Mingsu.</p>
<p>This matter had been done secretly by Honn Shinsakura without Sei Gasakai’s knowledge. Although Honn Shinsakura wasn’t happy about doing such a thing, in order to protect the foundation of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace, Honn Shinsakura was willing to lose his reputation and even had the resolve to be expelled by Sei Gasakai.</p>
<p>“Hyakki Yagyō, the Night Parade of One Hundred Demons?” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but think of a myth when he heard Honn Shinsakura and company’s description of the descent of the Calamity creature.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“That’s right. It’s the Ghost Parade.” Honn Shinsakura nodded slightly. In fact, they used this word to describe the coming disaster.</p>
<p>When Wu Zonglie and company saw how Honn Shinsakura treated Zhou Wen as though he were an elder, they couldn’t help but wonder about his origins.</p>
<p>They shared the same thoughts as Ji Moqing. They felt that Zhou Wen definitely wasn’t as young as he looked. He was definitely an old monster who knew how to retain his youth. He just looked young.</p>
<p>Under their lead, Zhou Wen arrived at the dimensional zone where the Niten Flying Immortal Palace was.</p>
<p>Beside the dimensional zone known as Fuji Island, Zhou Wen saw the tiny palm symbol he hadn’t seen in a long time.</p>
<p>He took out his phone and snapped a picture of the palm engraved with the words “Fuji Island”. The phone quickly entered the download screen.</p>
<p>It’s been a long time since I downloaded a dungeon. Zhou Wen’s hundred years felt like a dream. He hadn’t touched the game in the past hundred years. Now that he was holding his phone, he couldn’t help but feel his hands itch.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>It wasn’t for gaming or farming equipment. It was just that his hands were itching.</p>
<p>“The taboo power in Fuji Island is extremely strange. Apart from pure physical strength and the power of swords and sabers, you can’t use any other powers. Otherwise, it will trigger the taboo power and be instantly destroyed. The power of all kinds of Companion Beasts is included.” Before entering the island, Honn Shinsakura specially exhorted Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“That’s a little odd. If I have fire-elemental powers, can I use them?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“No. Other than pure physical strength, no other power can be released,” Honn Shinsakura answered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed Honn Shinsakura onto the island and gave it a try. Indeed, he couldn’t release his Essence Energy outside his body as though his body had become a cage.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder Sei Gasakai chose this place to establish the Niten Flying Immortal Palace. It’s indeed a good place, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing was detained by Wu Zonglie and followed behind. She looked around as though she was searching for a way to escape.</p>
<p>She was quite bold. Despite being a seventeen-year-old girl that was being escorted to such a place, she showed no panic on her face.</p>
<p>However, her eyes darted around, but she couldn’t think of a way to escape.</p>
<p>Wu Zonglie and company felt terrible as though their curiosities were being scratched by a cat. They wanted to know about Zhou Wen, but Honn Shinsakura kept mum about his origins. It made them feel terrible.</p>
<p>After entering Fuji Island, Honn Shinsakura bowed at Zhou Wen and said, “Sir, I need to make a move first. I’ll inform my master that you are here. Wu Zonglie will take you there.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded slightly. Only then did Honn Shinsakura bid farewell and leave.</p>
<p>Wu Zonglie continued leading Zhou Wen and Ji Moqing forward. Soon, they arrived at a man-made city.</p>
<p>This city wasn’t big, and most of the buildings were made of wood. Zhou Wen realized at a glance that the wood hadn’t been cut with saws or other tools, but with blades.</p>
<p>All the buildings in the city were cleaved out with blade strikes. Furthermore, there were definitely many people who used them.</p>
<p>After entering the city and walking along the streets, the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace sized up Zhou Wen and Ji Moqing curiously.</p>
<p>Just as they took a step down the street, they suddenly saw a group of people rushing over.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen recognized the person in the lead. It was the elder, Sei Gasakai, whom he had met in Peony Garden. However, not only had Sei Gasakai not aged, but he also looked younger. Furthermore, his aura was more elegant and ethereal.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1120'>Chapter 1120: Return Blade</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The surprise in Wu Zonglie and company’s hearts intensified. With Sei Gasakai’s current status overseas, even if those famous devils came, they had to treat him with respect. There was no reason for Sei Gasakai to welcome them.</p>
<p>Now, not only had Sei Gasakai come out to welcome him, but he had even walked as far as half a street. From his looks, if Zhou Wen hadn’t entered Fuji Island, he would probably have directly welcomed him at the dock.</p>
<p>The ordinary disciples on the way didn’t know what had happened. However, when they saw Sei Gasakai appear on the long street, they automatically retreated to the side and stopped to watch.</p>
<p>Soon, Sei Gasakai arrived near Zhou Wen. He had originally wanted to walk in front of Zhou Wen, but he seemed to think of something and stopped a few steps away from him.</p>
<p>“All disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Sect, listen up,” Sei Gasakai said with a solemn expression. His voice spread throughout the Niten Flying Immortal Palace.</p>
<p>The disciples in the palace looked at Sei Gasakai and respectfully waited for his orders.</p>
<p>“Return Blade,” Sei Gasakai said.</p>
<p>Everyone was taken aback, but they quickly reacted. They sat on the ground in a kneeling posture before unsheathing the blade at their waists. Together with the scabbard, they carefully placed it on the ground in front of them.</p>
<p>Return Blade was a ritual of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū. Typically, when juniors sought guidance from their seniors, they would respectfully place their blades in front of them to indicate their intentions.</p>
<p>They didn’t know why Sei Gasakai wanted them to perform Blade Return.</p>
<p>However, Sei Gasakai was the creator of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū. He was a god-like existence in the hearts of his disciples, so no one dared to question his orders. Although they didn’t understand, they did as he said.</p>
<p>On the long street, only Zhou Wen, Ji Moqing, and Sei Gasakai were still standing.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai also pulled out the two blades attached to his waist. He held them with both hands and offered them to Zhou Wen. “Sir, in front of you, Sei Gasakai doesn’t dare carry a blade. Please accept them.”</p>
<p>With that said, many disciples were shocked beyond words. Sei Gasakai was publicly acknowledged as the number one in the Sword Dao overseas. Although he wasn’t the strongest in terms of level and strength overseas, he was the true number one when it came to swords.</p>
<p>Many famous experts overseas, such as Uesugi Nao, had once consulted Sei Gasakai regarding sword arts and had benefited greatly.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai was no longer just a single person. He symbolized a spirit. To be recognized as a Sword Sage overseas, his status in the hearts of many overseas experts was obvious.</p>
<p>However, such a person just claimed that he didn’t dare hold a blade in front of Zhou Wen. It was as though it was an insult to the blade. How could they not be alarmed?</p>
<p>Wu Zonglie was dumbfounded. He originally imagined that Zhou Wen and Sei Gasakai were old acquaintances or related by blood. Therefore, Sei Gasakai had made a disciple like Honn Shinsakura treat him as an elder.</p>
<p>However, from the looks of it, that wasn’t the case. Sei Gasakai’s actions were shocking.</p>
<p>This fellow is definitely a super devil… Could he be Jing Daoxian… Ji Moqing was extremely alarmed. Apart from Jing Daoxian, she couldn’t think of anyone else who was worthy of Sei Gasakai’s treatment.</p>
<p>“I haven’t used a weapon for a long time. Put it away,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai bowed slightly before putting away the two blades. However, he didn’t hold them again. Instead, he threw the two blades on the ground and said to the disciples, “Without Mr. Zhou, there wouldn’t be the present me and the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū. In the future, you have to treat him with more respect than you treat me. If there’s any disrespect, I will personally kill you.”</p>
<p>With that said, he led Zhou Wen to his residence.</p>
<p>The disciples knelt on the ground with their blades placed on the ground as they watched Zhou Wen and Sei Gasakai leave in a daze.</p>
<p>Only when the two of them entered Sei Gasakai’s Sword Sage Palace did Honn Shinsakura retract his blade and stand up. Then, he bowed slightly in the direction of Sword Sage Palace before retreating.</p>
<p>Devil… He must be a super devil… Who is he? Could he really be Jing Daoxian? But I heard that Jing Daoxian looks like an old man… Ji Moqing’s mind raced as she felt extremely unlucky. She never expected to encounter such a devil while escaping.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai was a martial arts fanatic. He discussed swords with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>It would probably be very difficult for an ordinary person to communicate normally with this elder known as Sword Sage. However, Zhou Wen had been trapped for a hundred years and had already developed the Heart Defying Sword formed by the three thousand sword intents to its limits.</p>
<p>He didn’t dare say anything else, but his cultivation in the Sword Dao was probably inferior to Sei Gasakai’s.</p>
<p>Furthermore, part of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū created by Sei Gasakai was inspired by Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal. The details Zhou Wen mentioned often enlightened Sei Gasakai.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if he should be happy or sad. He had never expected his Transcendent Flying Immortal to shine overseas.</p>
<p>However, from the looks of it, the conflict between the Federation and overseas was actually nothing. Humans faced too many survival crises, so they couldn’t be bothered with any internal strife.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai also shared some of his insights and Sword Dao insights, asking Zhou Wen for advice.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be impressed with Sei Gasakai when he heard that. He was indeed a sword arts genius. Zhou Wen had only figured out many of the insights Sei Gasakai had mentioned after being trapped for decades.</p>
<p>However, as Zhou Wen needed to cultivate more Essence Energy Arts, he didn’t constantly focus on his sword. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have taken him that long.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen occasionally gave him some pointers, speaking of Sei Gasakai’s innermost thoughts. He hit the nail on the head, making Sei Gasakai treat him like a god.</p>
<p>If what Sei Gasakai had done previously was just to remember his roots and his gratitude towards Zhou Wen, then now, Sei Gasakai was truly convinced. He almost considered himself a disciple.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Their discussion was interrupted only when a train whistle sounded. Just as Zhou Wen was wondering why there was a train here, a disciple rushed over in a panic to report that a dimensional creature that looked like a train was rushing towards Fuji Island.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also somewhat curious as he followed Sei Gasakai out to take a look.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen saw a train outside.</p>
<p>The train looked like an ancient steam train, but the front of it looked like the skull of a bull. As for the train carriages in the back, they looked like huge black coffins.</p>
<p>It chugged across the sea in the dark night; it’s wheels were burning with blue flames, like a ghost train from hell.</p>
<p>Wherever the Ghost Train went, seawater surged over as well, turning into huge waves that slammed into the island. Ordinary waves naturally couldn’t threaten the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū, but after the waves passed, the disciples who had been drenched by the waves seemed to lose their minds and they walked towards the Ghost Train. They couldn’t be stopped no matter what.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1121'>Chapter 1121: Ghost Train</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Hum!</p>
<p>With a sword hum tearing through the night sky, Honn Shinsakura slashed at the strange train with his two blades in hand.</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura held a long blade in one hand and a short blade in the other hand. The two blades flowed with pink flames, and his body looked very strange. He was very different from ordinary humans.</p>
<p>He was wearing armor. It wasn’t Guardian armor, but an ordinary Companion Beast armor.</p>
<p>However, at that moment, the Companion Beast armor was dyed pink by the pink flames flowing out of his body. Furthermore, as the pink flames constantly seeped out, they turned into points of light that resembled scattering snowflakes.</p>
<p>The light seemed to be emitted from his flesh and blood, not his Essence Energy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also sensed a powerful dimensional creature’s aura in the flames.</p>
<p>Could this be the Mythical Serum he mentioned? Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura slashed at the train like a flying immortal with intense pink flames. Just as the blade in his primary hand was about to slash at the train…</p>
<p>Wu!</p>
<p>The train’s steam whistle suddenly sounded as it spewed out large amounts of smoke from the exhaust. When Honn Shinsakura’s blade beam collided with the smoke, he was immediately enveloped by it. The pink flames immediately dimmed.</p>
<p>“Oh no, thanks to the effects of the Ghost Parade, the taboo power of Fuji Island is weakening.” Sei Gasakai’s expression changed slightly. He stepped forward and raised his blade above his head. His other hand also grabbed the hilt and swung down with both hands.</p>
<p>The invisible blade beam slashed at the train head, and a large amount of smoke spewed out from the mouth of the ox skeleton head at the train head. After making contact with Sei Gasakai’s invisible blade beam, Sei Gasakai’s invisible blade beam immediately vanished like a rock sinking into the sea.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai appeared to the left of the train as though he had teleported. He slashed with his blade repeatedly, and with every strike, his figure would switch to another position. His figure flickered, making him look like a ghost.</p>
<p>The continuous blade beams formed an invisible blade net. With the size of the train, it seemed impossible to dodge such blade beams.</p>
<p>The smoke it spewed out was only at the front of the train. The coffin-like carriages behind weren’t enveloped by smoke. Sei Gasakai’s target was those carriages.</p>
<p>Indeed, the train couldn’t dodge Sei Gasakai’s blade beam net. Blade beams slashed at its carriage.</p>
<p>The distant disciples were overjoyed. They believed that Sei Gasakai had succeeded and the train monster would be slain.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, they were alarmed to discover that Sei Gasakai’s Mythical-level blade beams, which he produced with the help of the Guardian armor, struck the train carriage like water entering a sponge. They were instantly absorbed and didn’t leave any marks on the carriage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned slightly because he could already tell that this train monster was likely a Terror-grade existence.</p>
<p>With a thought, a clown symbol appeared on his Life Wheel. The clown symbol was ghostly and demonic, as though it was an unreal existence in the void. It also seemed very corporeal—the red color on the clown’s face was vivid like blood.</p>
<p>On the other side of the Life Wheel, a Sword Pill appeared, causing Zhou Wen’s sword intent to flourish.</p>
<p>In the next second, Zhou Wen’s figure appeared in front of the train. The Bamboo Blade in his hand slashed through the thick smoke with a terrifying sword beam. He extended his hand and pulled Honn Shinsakura, who was about to be sucked into the train. Before the smoke could envelop them, he teleported out again.</p>
<p>On the other side, Sei Gasakai’s aura had already reached its limits. His entire body and Guardian armor emitted a powerful aura.</p>
<p>The originally invisible blade beam condensed into something corporeal in his hand, turning into two blades—one long, one short.</p>
<p>The blades were filled with vitality. Under the influence of the long blade, the flowers and plants in the nearby area quickly bloomed.</p>
<p>As for the short blade in his other hand, it had a deathly aura. Any creature that came into contact with that aura immediately withered.</p>
<p>The dual blades in Sei Gasakai’s hand danced as they matched his body that seemed to be spirited away. He constantly appeared in different spots around the train. As he dodged the smoke, he released blade beams of life and death at the train.</p>
<p>The blade beams of life and death slashed at the train carriage, scuffing it. However, the scuffs were too shallow. Furthermore, the carriage seemed to have self-healing abilities. In an instant, the scuffs vanished.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai seemed to have expected this situation. His expression remained unchanged as the two blades fused into one in his hand, turning into a saber.</p>
<p>The saber had life and death coexisting, as though it had some fateful power of reincarnation, causing all life in the surroundings to turn upside down.</p>
<p>The withered grass regained its vitality once again. The tree that was originally filled with vitality instantly withered. In the same area, it was as though Death and the Goddess of Life had simultaneously released their divine powers. The power of life and death constantly intertwined.</p>
<p>Finally, Sei Gasakai raised his saber high and slashed down.</p>
<p>A single strike separates the path of life and death. Destiny is not in the hands of humans. What a powerful will of life and death. It’s no wonder Sei Gasakai can be called a Sword Sage. Just this strike alone makes him worthy of the title. Zhou Wen marveled inwardly, but he didn’t believe that this strike could seriously injure the train monster.</p>
<p>As the terrifying saber beam slashed down, the train’s steam whistle sounded again. However, this time, what spewed out wasn’t smoke, but blue spectral flames.</p>
<p>The spectral flames instantly spread across the entire train. When the raging blue flames had enveloped the entire train, it made the strange train even more illusory. The carriages seemed to have turned into blue flames, allowing one to see straight through the carriage.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai’s Life-and-Death Saber Beam failed to injure the train. The saber beam passed through the train’s body as though the train was only an illusion and not a real existence.</p>
<p>Wu!</p>
<p>The train suddenly accelerated and slammed into the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū lineage. After the disciples were hit, they didn’t fly out with tragic cries. Instead, they vanished as though they had been devoured by the Ghost Train. It also made people realize that the train wasn’t an illusion, but a real Terror creature.</p>
<p>“A true Terror-grade dimensional creature; retreat immediately to the valley.” Sei Gasakai’s face was somewhat pale as he ordered all the disciples to retreat.</p>
<p>He was known as a half-step Terror which meant that his realm of thought had reached the Terror grade. However, his true strength and level weren’t at the necessary level. It was impossible for him to fight a Terror-grade creature.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū didn’t panic. They retreated in an orderly manner, but their speed of retreat was far inferior to the train. They watched as the train roared and charged forward again.</p>
<p>The eyes of the disciples at the back were filled with horror, but they didn’t scatter in random directions. Instead, they turned around and charged at the train with blades in hand. Their faces were filled with determination as though they wanted to use their bodies to buy time for their companions to escape.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen knew very well that their actions were no different from courting death.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen’s Wheel of Destiny changed again.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1122'>Chapter 1122: Might of the Hell King</h3>
<p>1</p>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>On the Wheel of Destiny, a third symbol appeared. It was an existence that resembled a god or devil. It sat cross-legged with its eyes closed like an old monk in meditation, but also like a sleeping devil.</p>
<p>When the symbol was complete, a huge Hell King projection appeared in front of Zhou Wen. As for Zhou Wen, he had already teleported above the train.</p>
<p>​ </p>
<p>The Supreme Hell King shadow, that resembled a giant godfiend, slammed down on the head of the train.</p>
<p>The chugging Ghost Train slowed down. Supreme Hell King blocked the front of the train with both hands, but his body was rapidly pushed back by a terrifying force. His hands that had made contact with the front of the train were also being devoured by the strange blue flames.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat delighted when he saw that Supreme Hell King’s strength was effective against the train.</p>
<p>Supreme Hell King was still at the Mythical stage after all. To be able to reduce the Ghost Train’s speed in a head-on collision meant that Supreme Hell King’s strength had a powerful restraining effect on the Ghost Train. Otherwise, other Mythical Life Souls would have long been devoured by it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen seemed to gain some insight as he sensed the information from Supreme Hell King.</p>
<p>After a hundred years of cultivation, the Small Perfection of Wisdom had been pushed to the limits of the Mythical stage by Zhou Wen. Supreme Hell King was also at the peak of the Mythical stage, but for some reason, he had failed to take the next step forward.</p>
<p>Now, having Supreme Hell King fight the Terror-grade ghost train, it made Zhou Wen understand the root of the problem.</p>
<p>The reason Supreme Hell King had failed to advance wasn’t because Zhou Wen’s realm wasn’t high enough, but because his body had been limited when he was trapped.</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhou Wen had a vague guess that he had really been trapped for five years, not a hundred years.</p>
<p>This was because his realm had been constantly improving, but the Essence Energy Art in his body hadn’t kept up with the improvement in his realm. It was very likely because his body clock and thoughts weren’t synchronized.</p>
<p>In other words, Zhou Wen felt that he had experienced a hundred years, but his body had only experienced five years.</p>
<p>What did Teacher do? Or could it be that it was originally the power of Mount Fangzhang? Teacher only used its powers? Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to think about that.</p>
<p>Supreme Hell King was quickly pushed back by the train as his body constantly burned with the blue spectral fire.</p>
<p>However, the Ghost Train slowed down significantly as a result. It allowed the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū to retreat to the side in time. Only the train continued pushing Supreme Hell King forward.</p>
<p>Supreme Hell King was like an emotionless machine as he transmitted everything he had experienced to Zhou Wen’s mind, intensifying his feelings.</p>
<p>Then let’s give it a try. Zhou Wen’s eyes focused as the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra quickly flowed in his body. The Supreme Hell King symbol on the Wheel of Destiny also burned with invisible karmic sinflames.</p>
<p>After the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū escaped, they watched the battle between the Ghost Train and the Supreme Hell King.</p>
<p>They could tell that Supreme Hell King was clearly a Life Soul. Furthermore, Zhou Wen didn’t have the aura of a dimensional creature or a Guardian. He was likely a human.</p>
<p>However, it was unbelievable that a pure human could be on a par with the Ghost Train.</p>
<p>After all, Sei Gasakai and Honn Shinsakura were experts at the Mythical stage. Sei Gasakai was known as a half-step Terror. Even he found it difficult to fight the Ghost Train. A pure human who could use his Life Soul to temporarily fend off the Ghost Train was already shocking enough.</p>
<p>However, at that moment, they couldn’t be bothered to think too much. They watched as Supreme Hell King slammed into the mountain behind him, courtesy of the Ghost Train. Furthermore, Supreme Hell King’s body was completely enveloped by blue spectral flames. Flames burst out everywhere from his collision. The blue spectral flames rose and expanded, completely devouring Supreme Hell King’s body and the mountain behind him.</p>
<p>Everyone believed that Supreme Hell King was doomed, but only Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up. At the same time, the Supreme Hell King symbol on the Life Wheel emitted a blinding light.</p>
<p>As the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū were retreating, they suddenly realized that something was amiss.</p>
<p>After the Ghost Train hit the mountain, it stopped. It didn’t shatter the mountain, nor did it crash through the mountain.</p>
<p>Its wheels were still spinning, and the steam whistle was still humming, but it didn’t continue advancing.</p>
<p>The mountain in front of it was still enveloped by the raging spectral flames as Zhou Wen floated above it.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>A strange sound came from the mountain peak wrapped in spectral flames. It sounded like something had cracked, or like firecrackers crackling.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the blue flames rapidly dissipated. Rather than saying that they had vanished, it was better to say that they had been devoured. However, no one could see what had devoured the spectral flames.</p>
<p>As the spectral flames subsided, a mountain peak enveloped in flames gradually appeared. In front of the mountain peak was Supreme Hell King, who they imagined had been destroyed.</p>
<p>However, Supreme Hell King probably couldn’t be called Supreme Hell King anymore.</p>
<p>He sat cross-legged like a Buddha, but he had four faces and eight arms. Each arm had a different stance and formed different hand seals. The four faces were also different.</p>
<p>The forward-facing face was emotionless, as though it was a machine without any feelings.</p>
<p>On the left side, there was a smile on his face, making anyone who cast their eyes on him feel like they were welcoming a spring breeze.</p>
<p>The right side of his face was the complete opposite. There were faint tears of blood at the corners of his eyes as he wore a look of pity and sorrow.</p>
<p>The back-facing face was indiscernible, but one could vaguely sense that the eyes on the face seemed to be prying into the secrets of all life.</p>
<p>No one could see the face on the back because behind him, there was a black hole that resembled hell. It was like a black Buddhistic glow floating behind him.</p>
<p>The interior of the black hole was filled with all sorts of strange things. There was also the faint sound of ghosts crying or howling. Although one couldn’t see anything, it made them feel endless fear.</p>
<p>As for the Ghost Train, it no longer advanced. Not only did it not advance, but it also began to retreat.</p>
<p>Its wheels spun in the reverse direction and a siren sounded, but its body failed to retreat. Not only did it not retreat, but it was also pulled by a strange force as it constantly approached Supreme Hell King.</p>
<p>Supreme Hell King’s eyes were slightly closed as one of his palms slowly slapped down.</p>
<p>The Ghost Train spewed out spectral flames in a bid to stop the descending hand, but before the spectral flames could touch the hand, it was devoured by invisible karmic sinflames.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The terrifying Ghost Train was shattered by the palm of the hand, turning into flames that filled the sky. However, the flames were devoured by the invisible karmic sinflames while still in midair.</p>
<p>As for the people who had been devoured by the Ghost Train, they also fell out. Following that, a resplendent emerald-green crystal dropped.</p>
<p>The disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū stared blankly at Supreme Hell King and Zhou Wen, who was floating above Supreme Hell King. They seemed to understand why Sei Gasakai, who they viewed as a god, held Zhou Wen in such high esteem.</p>
<p>He advanced to the Mythical stage with a human body… Is he really human… Honn Shinsakura looked at Zhou Wen with a complicated expression as he muttered to himself.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1123'>Chapter 1123: New Function</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s not a Companion Egg. In a room, Zhou Wen played with the crystal that had dropped from the Ghost Train. He used his phone to snap a picture and found it to be a 96-Strength Crystal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Strength hadn’t reached its peak, so it was perfect for him.</p>
<p>​ </p>
<p>A warm stream fused into Zhou Wen’s body before his Strength stat rapidly increased. It only stopped after reaching 81.</p>
<p>It actually reached 81 points—the limit of the Mythical stage? Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. The previous advancements had required special methods to add the additional point.</p>
<p>However, this time, it reached 81 points without any restrictions.</p>
<p>Does this mean that my body can already match a natural Mythical creature? Zhou Wen guessed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t think too much about this problem. Now, he wanted to know more about the situation with Supreme Hell King. He used his phone to carefully look at his stats.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen: Mythical</p>
<p>Life Providence: Sigh of the King</p>
<p>Life Soul: Slaughterer</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: No Engravings (One Spin)</p>
<p>Terror Form: Great Brahma (S-grade)</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>I really gained the ability to transform into the Terror form, but my level is still at the Mythical stage. This will be the same as Little Neo. Zhou Wen was somewhat delighted.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate had always been different. Now that he had an ability similar to Demonic Neonate, it meant that he was no longer ordinary. Furthermore, he seemed to be able to continue making breakthroughs with the other Essence Energy Arts and obtain the Terror transformation ability in a seemingly feasible manner.</p>
<p>It’s really interesting that the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra condenses Great Brahma. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and looked at the description on his phone.</p>
<p>Previously, when he advanced to the Mythical stage, his phone game gained three new functions—Bloodline, Samsara, and Birth. He had been trapped for ages without having the chance to use his phone. He didn’t know what these three functions were, so he decided to study them.</p>
<p>After carefully studying the three functions, Zhou Wen’s expression turned odd.</p>
<p>The Bloodline function was a function that enhanced Companion Beasts’ abilities. One could use Companion Beasts as raw materials to strengthen another Companion Beast.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Companion Beasts that were used as raw materials would vanish. As for another Companion Beast, it was possible to obtain double Life Providences, or even triple Life Providences. There might even be more.</p>
<p>At a glance, this function was amazing. Wouldn’t a Companion Beast with multiple Life Providences be invincible?</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen knew that things weren’t that simple. The previous pet fusion function had already taught him a lesson. It wasn’t easy to even roll skills. The chances of creating a double Life Providence were definitely not high. The chances of having multiple Life Providences were definitely terrifyingly low.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen randomly used a few low-level Companion Beasts to give it a try. The chances were indeed very low. He used the Bloodline function ten times in a row, but he failed all ten times. There was no mechanism that gave guaranteed success from doing it ten times in a row.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>However, this function was still pretty good for Zhou Wen. After all, he had plenty of Companion Beasts. No matter how low the success rate was, throwing hundreds or thousands of Companion Beasts at the problem would eventually lead to success.</p>
<p>Of course, the premise was that a Companion Beast as a main pet had the value of being upgraded.</p>
<p>For example, if Demonic Neonate and Banana Fairy had a Life Providence that suited them, Zhou Wen didn’t mind helping wasting Companion Beasts on them.</p>
<p>The function of Samsara wasn’t as simple as the Bloodline function. Zhou Wen didn’t understand what it meant for the time being. In-game, it only mentioned that killing dimensional creatures gave him a chance of obtaining Samsara Stones. Samsara Stones could allow a Companion Beast to be reincarnated.</p>
<p>As for what the Samsara Stone looked like and what effects it had after reincarnation, there was no detailed description.</p>
<p>The final Birth function was the strangest function. It was a Companion Beast’s birth function.</p>
<p>Companion Beasts didn’t need to mate to conceive. Regardless of whether they were male or female, as long as they reached the requirement to give birth, they could have children.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen studied the conditions for Birth and realized that things weren’t simple. It wasn’t easy to get a Companion Beast to give birth. Furthermore, the higher the Companion Beast’s grade, the more stringent the conditions for giving birth. Furthermore, the Birth conditions for each Companion Beast were different.</p>
<p>As long as he used the Birth function to check on a Companion Beast, he would know its fertility conditions, but not all Companion Beasts had it stated—Demonic Neonate being an example.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy did have fertility conditions to give birth, but her fertility conditions required her to choose her spouse freely. He had no idea how Banana Fairy chose her spouse.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Could there be a Banana Man in this world? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and found it unlikely. He had never heard of any famous banana creature being male.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth’s fertility conditions were even more extreme. It directly indicated that it was the only Behemoth in the world, so it couldn’t find a fertility partner.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>After looking through his Companion Beasts, he realized that there were all sorts of strange fertility conditions, but there weren’t many Mythical Companion Beasts that could immediately give birth.</p>
<p>Now, the only ones who could meet the fertility requirements were the Light Concealment Sword and the Night Immaculate Sword.</p>
<p>The fertility conditions of these two Mythical swords were sword-type partners. They happened to be matched as a pair. Since Zhou Wen didn’t use them much, he decided to give it a try and see what the Birth function could produce.</p>
<p>He placed the Light Concealment Sword and the Night Immaculate Sword in the selection box before clicking on Birth.</p>
<p>Then, he saw the Light Concealment Sword and Night Immaculate Sword light up at the same time before flying together. Just as they were about to collide, the phone screen turned black. Then, a notification appeared: “Birth in progress. It will take 36 days.”</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, is this censorship? Zhou Wen still wanted to see how the two swords could reproduce. He couldn’t help but feel depressed.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In the past two years, the signal from Earth’s communication satellites had been worsening, especially at sea. There was almost no signal, causing the separation between the Federation and overseas to worsen.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai told Zhou Wen that there was a Companion Beast that could deliver long-distance communications. However, he didn’t have such a Companion Beast. If Zhou Wen wanted to use his phone for communication, he had to return inland.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and decided to stay for the time being.</p>
<p>It was actually not common for a Calamity-grade creature to appear. Sometimes, it might not even appear once a year. Sometimes, it would appear several times a year. Furthermore, the location was not fixed.</p>
<p>The last time a Calamity creature appeared was in West District. It was a grand Undead Calamity that swept through the entire West District. Thankfully, the Calamity creature rushed out of Earth not long after it appeared, and the Undead army scattered. Otherwise, the humans in the West District would have been wiped out.</p>
<p>Humans didn’t get out of it without benefits. After the Undead Calamity, large numbers of Undead creatures appeared everywhere in the West District. Hunting Undead creatures also benefited humans.</p>
<p>According to past experience, with the birth of a Calamity creature, many Terror-grade creatures would appear. Furthermore, they were rare top-grade creatures.</p>
<p>I wonder if the appearance of a Calamity creature can be downloaded into a game dungeon? Zhou Wen felt that he could give it a try because Sei Gasakai had told him that every Calamity-grade creature that appeared resulted in the destruction of a dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to see if he could download the dimensional zone before the Calamity creature appeared. That way, a Calamity creature might appear in-game.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1124'>Chapter 1124: Bride Island</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>According to Sei Gasakai, the Ghost Parade covered many areas in the East Sea. Many places had large numbers of Yin-attribute dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>This was only the prelude to the Ghost Parade. When the true Calamity creature appeared, there were definitely more Yin-attribute dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>​ </p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know much about the legends here. Sei Gasakai told him that if the Ghost Parade was the same as the legends, there would probably be hundreds of dimensional creatures like the Ghost Train.</p>
<p>As for the source of the Ghost Parade, Sei Gasakai wasn’t too sure either. He only knew that a large number of Yin-attribute dimensional creatures had first appeared in the Ryukyu Islands. As for which dimensional zone had appeared first, Sei Gasakai wasn’t too sure.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen planned on heading to the Ryukyu Islands to take a look before the Calamity creature appeared.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai originally wanted to accompany Zhou Wen, but because he needed to resist dimensional creatures that might appear, he ultimately chose to give up. However, he still got one of his personal disciples to be Zhou Wen’s guide.</p>
<p>As for Ji Moqing, who had been captured, Sei Gasakai didn’t plan on using her to threaten Fang Mingsu. Therefore, he got Zhou Wen to take Ji Moqing along and send her back inland.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had plans on returning inland, so he agreed.</p>
<p>After the three of them set off together, Ji Moqing didn’t believe anything Zhou Wen said. She felt that Zhou Wen was a super devil overseas. There must be a conspiracy behind bringing her along. It was very likely to be to deal with Fang Mingsu.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered to explain. On the other hand, Sei Gasakai’s disciple treated Zhou Wen as though he was a god. Or perhaps it was because of Sei Gasakai’s orders that she listened to Zhou Wen like a maid.</p>
<p>The female disciple of Sei Gasakai was named Shiraishi Satomi. She was around 27 years old. Although she was still at the Epic stage, she was accomplished in the way of the sword. Apart from Honn Shinsakura, she was the disciple Sei Gasakai was most proud of.</p>
<p>Not only was Shiraishi Satomi in charge of leading the way, but she also took care of Zhou Wen’s food and lodging during the journey. Almost without Zhou Wen needing to say a word, she prepared everything. She was even more meticulous than Zhou Wen when handling his own matters.</p>
<p>This devil is indeed lying to me. This isn’t the direction to return inland at all. Ji Moqing cursed inwardly, but she didn’t dare show it in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Under Shiraishi Satomi’s guidance, Zhou Wen quickly arrived at the Ryukyu Islands. Indeed, he realized that there were many Yin-attribute dimensional creatures on the islands.</p>
<p>“What famous dimensional zones does Ryukyu have?” Zhou Wen asked Shiraishi Satomi.</p>
<p>“Ryukyu isn’t too far from the overseas islands or inland. Its culture has been affected by two aspects. Its myths and legends aren’t overly complicated, but there are many scattered local legends. In particular, there are many legends regarding the uninhabited islands and sea monsters. Many of those uninhabited islands have dimensional zones. However, I’ve never heard of any of them being famous. With the Ghost Parade stemming from the Ryukyu area, it has left many people alarmed.”</p>
<p>After a pause, she continued, “If you want to talk about the famous ones, there are a total of four famous uninhabited islands’ dimensional zones here—Emotional Island, Bride Island, Minor God Island, and Seed Island.”</p>
<p>Shiraishi Satomi gave Zhou Wen the details of the four islands. Finally, she told him, “Minor God Island is rather far from the area where the Yin-attribute dimensional creatures are appearing. I don’t think it will be there. The most likely ones are Emotional Island, Bride Island, and Seed Island. We are the closest to Bride Island now. Do you want to take a look?”</p>
<p>“Let’s head to Bride Island first.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.</p>
<p>It was still daytime, so there weren’t many Yin-attribute creatures that appeared. Furthermore, they were relatively low-level. It was hard to tell if that were the case at night. Even if it wasn’t an island, it would be very dangerous out at sea.</p>
<p>The reason Bride Island had this name was because of an ancient legend.</p>
<p>Legend had it that three diligent fisherman brothers lived on that island, but because they were too poor, the three brothers didn’t get married. In the end, the three brothers came up with a plan and gathered money to have their eldest brother wed somebody.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they agreed that after the eldest brother got a wife, the three brothers would continue working hard together and save money for the second brother.</p>
<p>The three brothers gathered enough money and got a wife for the eldest brother who was overjoyed because of her beauty.</p>
<p>Early the next morning after the wedding, the eldest brother went out to sea to catch fish. Considering how his second brother wasn’t getting any younger, he wanted to catch more fish for money to get him a wife.</p>
<p>However, the eldest brother never returned. A few days later, his boat floated back, but it was empty.</p>
<p>Unable to find their eldest brother, the two brothers knew that he was definitely doomed; they had no choice but to hold a funeral for him.</p>
<p>Life wasn’t easy back then, so there wasn’t much to be particular about. After the eldest brother died, the second brother and third brother came up with a plan and had the second brother marry their eldest brother’s wife.</p>
<p>On the second day of their marriage, the second brother went fishing out at sea, never to return as well.</p>
<p>The nearby fishermen began to spread rumors, saying that the bride jinxed her husband and that she was a witch.</p>
<p>However, the third brother didn’t believe them. He still married the same bride after his brother’s funeral.</p>
<p>After all, the bride was too beautiful. It was no wonder the third brother was tempted. However, he remained a little wary. After getting married, he planned on resting for a few days and not go out fishing so quickly.</p>
<p>However, no one saw the third brother again. After a period of time, someone boldly went to the island and arrived at the three brothers’ house. It had already been abandoned. In the house, there was a man’s skeleton, but the bride was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>The nearby fishermen said that the bride was a sea demon. No one dared to go to the island again, and that was how the name Bride Island came about.</p>
<p>After the dimensional storms, dimensional zones appeared on Bride Island. The nearby fishermen had once heard female sobbing on the island. None of the people who boldly went to the island returned alive. This island thus became notorious.</p>
<p>Now that the origins of the Ghost Parade were nearby, Bride Island was considered one of the more suspicious dimensional zones.</p>
<p>Soon, the three of them arrived near Bride Island. Zhou Wen looked at the legendary Bride Island and realized that it wasn’t very big. It was probably smaller than a village, but the island was covered in fog. Even with Truth Listener’s ability, it couldn’t hear what was on the island.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was sizing up Bride Island, he suddenly saw a few large ships approaching from afar. On careful look, the symbol on the large ship belonged to the Federation.</p>
<p>When Ji Moqing saw the Federation’s ships, she was delighted, then a little worried.</p>
<p>This place wasn’t too far inland, so it wasn’t strange to encounter Federation ships. However, in Ji Moqing’s opinion, Zhou Wen was a peerless overseas devil. If she sought help from those Federation ships, she might end up harming them.</p>
<p>Just as Ji Moqing was still hesitating about whether to call for help, the ships had already cruised over. There was a person standing on the deck of the large ship in front. When Ji Moqing saw the person’s appearance, she was immediately overjoyed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1125'>Chapter 1125: The New Four War Gods</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>That person was Fang Mingsu, Ji Moqing’s brother-in-law.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know Fang Mingsu, but Shiraishi Satomi long knew of his fame. If she had met him in the past, under such circumstances, she would definitely have turned tail without giving him a chance to see her.</p>
<p>​ </p>
<p>However, with Zhou Wen beside her, she didn’t think she needed to run.</p>
<p>Although Fang Mingsu was very strong and was known as one of the four new war gods of the Federation, with his Guardian having reached the Terror grade, Shiraishi Satomi didn’t believe that he was stronger than Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing lowered her head and didn’t say a word. She had also seen Zhou Wen’s strength. Such a terrifying Ghost Train had been smacked to death by his Life Soul. Such strength was probably not much weaker than Fang Mingsu’s.</p>
<p>Now that she was in Zhou Wen’s hands, she was afraid that Fang Mingsu would be threatened by Zhou Wen and company because of her.</p>
<p>“It’s Fang Mingsu,” Shiraishi Satomi whispered when she saw that Zhou Wen didn’t seem to recognize him.</p>
<p>So he’s Fang Mingsu? Zhou Wen sized up Fang Mingsu and felt somewhat intrigued.</p>
<p>He was curious about Fang Mingsu not because of how strong he was or how famous he was, but because Fang Mingsu and An Tianzuo were the four new War Gods of the Federation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was mainly curious how strong a person who was An Tianzuo’s peer was.</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu clearly knew that Ji Moqing was here and was here for her.</p>
<p>When the ships were a few hundred meters away from Zhou Wen and company, they finally stopped. Fang Mingsu stood at the bow and said to Ji Moqing with a smile, “Little Qing, don’t worry. Since I’m here, I won’t let you suffer any more grievances.”</p>
<p>“Brother-in-law.” Ji Moqing’s eyes immediately turned red.</p>
<p>After all, she was only seventeen. Although she was rather scheming, it would be a lie to say that she wasn’t afraid after being abducted overseas.</p>
<p>Now that Fang Mingsu was here, she finally had someone she could rely on. She no longer needed to rely on herself. She was immediately awash in emotions.</p>
<p>“Don’t cry.” Fang Mingsu stepped down from the boat and walked step by step over the seawater. The seawater didn’t even wet his shoes.</p>
<p>“I’ve long heard of the famous name of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū. I’ve always yearned for the name of Sword Sage, but I never expected him to do such a thing. It’s really disappointing. I guess Sword Sage Sei Gasakai’s title is just an empty title. Otherwise, why would he do such a despicable thing?” Fang Mingsu said as he walked. Soon, he was less than ten meters away from Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Fang Mingsu insult Sei Gasakai, Shiraishi Satomi was immediately enraged. Although she knew that she was no match for him, she still drew her blade to defend her master’s honor.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out to press down on Shiraishi Satomi’s hand that was holding the blade. He looked at Fang Mingsu and said, “There’s more to this matter than meets the eye. It wasn’t done by Sword Sage. Thankfully, this lady wasn’t injured. Now that she’s returned to you perfectly fine, how about we drop this matter?”</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu did not answer. He only looked at Ji Moqing and asked, “Little Qing, did they bully you?”</p>
<p>“No.” Ji Moqing hurriedly shook her head.</p>
<p>If it were any other time, with Fang Mingsu as her backer, she would definitely add fuel to the fire and complain. However, after seeing how terrifying Zhou Wen was, she also hoped that this matter would end here and not cause any further problems.</p>
<p>“I’ll leave her to you. We’ll take our leave now.” Zhou Wen gestured for Shiraishi Satomi to throw Ji Moqing at Fang Mingsu before turning the boat’s bow and leaving.</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu caught Ji Moqing and again asked her if she had suffered.</p>
<p>On the other side, the other ships blocked Zhou Wen’s path.</p>
<p>“What’s the meaning of this?” Zhou Wen asked Fang Mingsu.</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu didn’t even look at Zhou Wen as he continued speaking to Ji Moqing.</p>
<p>Many humans appeared on the ship. One of them was a brawny, bald man in a military uniform with a huge ax over his shoulder. He said loudly, “Do you think our marshal’s sister is someone you can capture and release as you wish? Would you be willing to have me abduct your wife for a month before returning her to you?”</p>
<p>“Then what must be done to satisfy you?” Zhou Wen felt that although the man’s words were crude, they weren’t wrong.</p>
<p>This matter was indeed Honn Shinsakura’s fault. It was not their fault for being overbearing.</p>
<p>“You can’t make the decision on this matter. Let Sei Gasakai talk to us,” the bald man said.</p>
<p>“Can you make calls on matters pertaining to the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū?” Zhou Wen asked Shiraishi Satomi.</p>
<p>Shiraishi Satomi first shook her head before nodding at Zhou Wen. “I can’t make the decision, but you can, according to Master before he left. You can even have our lives”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded and looked at the bald man. “I can make some decisions regarding the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū. I’ll get Honn Shinsakura to apologize and let you vent your anger. He didn’t do anything out of line. How about letting him live?”</p>
<p>The bald man was slightly taken aback as though he never expected Zhou Wen to be so easy-going. He couldn’t help but look at Fang Mingsu.</p>
<p>Only then did Fang Mingsu look up and say to Zhou Wen, “You can’t make the decision on this matter. Take me to Sei Gasakai. He has to personally give me an explanation.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown slightly as he looked at Fang Mingsu and said, “This matter has nothing to do with the Sword Sage. Why do you have to see him? Do you want to seek justice for her or do you want to go to the Niten Flying Immortal Palace?”</p>
<p>“Both. Lead the way,” Fang Mingsu said indifferently.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen already understood that Fang Mingsu’s true goal wasn’t to save Ji Moqing, or rather, it wasn’t entirely to save her. Perhaps Ji Moqing’s abduction had been a trap all along.</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu’s true target was the Niten Flying Immortal Palace and Sei Gasakai. There was no doubt about this, but Zhou Wen didn’t understand why.</p>
<p>“Sorry, if you want to go to the Niten Flying Immortal Palace, it’s best you go yourself. I don’t have time to accompany you.” Zhou Wen gestured for Shiraishi Satomi to continue sailing.</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu frowned slightly. In his intelligence, there didn’t seem to be such a person on Fuji Island. The three most important people in the Niten Flying Immortal Palace were Sei Gasakai, Honn Shinsakura, and Shiraishi Satomi.</p>
<p>As for Shiraishi Satomi, she seemed to follow this young man’s lead, but this young man wasn’t Honn Shinsakura. This left Fang Mingsu somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>However, there was no turning back now. Even if the young man in front of him was as powerful as Honn Shinsakura, it wouldn’t affect the overall situation much.</p>
<p>“Brother-in-law…” Ji Moqing seemed to come to a realization. She wanted to tell Fang Mingsu what had happened on Fuji Island, but she was cut off by Fang Mingsu. He even gave her a reassuring gesture.</p>
<p>“Regardless of whether you have the time or not, you have to make this trip.” With Fang Mingsu’s voice, the soldiers on the ship had already summoned their Companion Beasts and got them to target Zhou Wen and Shiraishi Satomi.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Scales appeared on the bald man’s body as he slashed at Zhou Wen like a monster.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1126'>Chapter 1126: Trapped on Lone Island</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned slightly. Just as he was about to summon his Companion Beast to fight the baldy, he suddenly felt a powerful spatial fluctuation.</p>
<p>Almost instantly, everyone felt the intense spatial fluctuations. In the next moment, before they could react, they saw the lighting in front of them change. The scenery around them no longer looked the same.</p>
<p>​ </p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood on the spot without moving, but the scene in front of him had turned into a white beach.</p>
<p>Previously, he was clearly standing on his boat, but now, there was actual sand beneath his feet.</p>
<p>Spatial powers? Furthermore, spatial teleportation on a large scale? Zhou Wen looked around and was immediately alarmed to discover that he was on Bride Island—the one he had seen at sea.</p>
<p>Standing on the beach, Zhou Wen could still see Emotional Island, which was across the sea from Bride Island.</p>
<p>Not far from the beach, Ji Moqing was lying on the ground. She looked unconscious. Her level was too low and her body was too weak. Zhou Wen didn’t feel anything from the spatial fluctuations, but she couldn’t withstand it and had fainted.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t see anyone else. It was as though the spatial fluctuations had teleported them to different locations on Bride Island.</p>
<p>Not in the mood to bother with Ji Moqing, Zhou Wen summoned a Poison Bat and got it to fly out of Bride Island. It hadn’t flown far when its body seemed to be sliced open by an invisible force. Blood spewed out and fell into the sea, dyeing the seawater red.</p>
<p>A spatial rift? Zhou Wen summoned another group of Poison Bats and sent them flying in different directions.</p>
<p>The outcome was the same. No matter where the Poison Bats flew, they would definitely be sliced apart once they were ten meters away from the island.</p>
<p>If Bride Island isn’t totally enveloped by spatial powers, it means that there’s an extremely terrifying spatial creature controlling everything, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen felt that the former was more likely. His present sensing abilities were excellent. If such an existence controlled everything, he should have sensed something.</p>
<p>If the entire island is enveloped by spatial powers, departure with teleportation and teleportation powers will definitely be prevented. Zhou Wen thought about how he could leave the island.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was in thought, Ji Moqing slowly woke up. When she was almost completely awake, she realized that Zhou Wen was beside her. She immediately jolted and got up to run.</p>
<p>However, as Ji Moqing ran, she realized that not only was her body not moving forward, but she was also retreating. Then, she felt a hand grab the back of her neck.</p>
<p>“Lord, please spare me. I really didn’t want to be your enemy. It’s that baldy who wants to deal with you. It really has nothing to do with me,” Ji Moqing pleaded with a sullen face.</p>
<p>“Your brother-in-law doesn’t seem to agree,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to make things difficult for Ji Moqing. He had taken note of Ji Moqing trying to persuade Fang Mingsu previously.</p>
<p>The reason he had captured her was because he didn’t want her to run around the island and die here for no reason. After all, she was a human life as well.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Heavens, what sins did I commit in my previous life? Why did you send me to this devil’s side again? Ji Moqing was utterly depressed, but she had no choice but to smile. “My brother-in-law doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth. That’s why he made an enemy of an expert like you. It really has nothing to do with me. I know how powerful you are. How can I be your enemy? Just a sneeze from you can kill me a thousand or ten thousand times…”</p>
<p>Although Ji Moqing said that, she was thinking to herself, Hmph, you devil. You can’t even compare to my brother-in-law. Otherwise, why would you release me the moment you saw him? Aren’t you afraid of him? Anyway, this island isn’t big. Let’s see what you can do to me when he comes to find me.</p>
<p>“Very good. I like good children who tell the truth,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>“I don’t have any other merits, I just don’t know how to lie.” Ji Moqing heaved a sigh of relief when she saw this, thinking that she had escaped another calamity.</p>
<p>“Alright then. You will keep telling the truth from now on. If I hear you lie or if what your truths sound unpleasant, I’ll chop off your head,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You… are really a smartas…” Ji Moqing had just said a word when she saw Zhou Wen look at her. She immediately changed her words.” You are so smart and handsome. I don’t know how to describe you. Even those fancy words can’t describe one in ten thousand of your good qualities…”</p>
<p>“Follow me. Let’s talk as we walk. If I hear any repeated truths, I’ll immediately behead you.” Zhou Wen walked slowly along the beach, hoping to find Shiraishi Satomi.</p>
<p>Bride Island didn’t look big, but Truth Listener’s ability couldn’t reach the center of the island. There seemed to be a mysterious force guarding it.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could see a village in the middle of the island with his naked eye, but he wasn’t willing to take the risk. He wanted to walk around the beach and see if he could find Shiraishi Satomi.</p>
<p>Even if he couldn’t find her, just finding the tiny palm symbol would be even better.</p>
<p>“Your eyes are like the sea of stars, deep and charming. Your voice is even more moving than the singing of angels. Please, let me hear your voice again. Even the word ‘scram’ will make me blush for a long time. You are the greatest man on Earth…”</p>
<p>Ji Moqing had long believed that Zhou Wen was a devil, so she took his words seriously. She racked her brains to think of all sorts of praises for Zhou Wen, but she didn’t dare stop for a moment. She didn’t care if her words disgusted her.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t pay attention to what Ji Moqing was saying. He kept staring ahead. There was a human-like figure standing by the beach.</p>
<p>The person was standing by the sea with a lute on his back, as though he was looking into the distance.</p>
<p>From the point of view of an ordinary person, he seemed to be a zither player, but Zhou Wen could tell from his extremely weak aura that he wasn’t a human, but a dimensional creature.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned Demonic Neonate, who had long recovered. She came out in her Terror form and sat on Zhou Wen’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing couldn’t see Demonic Neonate in her Terror form, nor was she in the mood to look. She was still pondering over what words to praise Zhou Wen with.</p>
<p>However, the zither player by the sea seemed to sense something as he turned to look at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he prepared for battle, but he heard the zither player say to him, “The path ahead is dangerous. It’s best you return.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if he really had no ill intentions or if he had other motives, so he asked, “What’s the danger?”</p>
<p>“I can’t say.” The zither player shook his head and turned back to continue looking at the distant sea.</p>
<p>Seeing that he had no intention of fighting, Zhou Wen attempted to circle around him and continue walking forward.</p>
<p>“If you encounter a woman standing by the bridge, don’t approach her or speak to her.” Zhou Wen had already walked over with Ji Moqing when the zither player suddenly said this, but he obviously had no intention of chasing after him.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter1127'>Chapter 1127: The Woman on the Bridge</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>This was the first time Zhou Wen had seen such a dimensional creature. He suspected that he was up to no good, so he didn’t dare trust him.</p>
<p>He continued walking forward with Ji Moqing. Bride Island was indeed very odd. He could see as far as the eye could see in the direction of the sea, but when he looked into the island, he could only see up to a few meters away. When he looked further into the distance, he felt that there was a fog enveloping the island. The forest and the village were faintly discernible—he couldn’t see them clearly.</p>
<p>​ </p>
<p>After walking for a short distance, a small river appeared in front of them. The small river slowly flowed around the village. The clean green water and green bamboo made one find it unbearable to step on them. Even breathing seemed to taint the air here.</p>
<p>“A woman!” Ji Moqing suddenly pointed ahead and shouted.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally saw that there really was a woman in front of him. Furthermore, she was standing on the bridge over the river.</p>
<p>It was a wooden bridge. It was unknown when it had been built, but the wood was the color of the original wood. There were no traces of paint. Time had left marks of wind and frost on the wood. Not only did it not affect the beauty of the wooden bridge, but it also gave off an ancient feeling.</p>
<p>Amidst the bamboo forest with the bridge and rivers, the woman in a kimono with red flowers embroidered on it stood on the bridge, holding a paper umbrella in her hand. Her black hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall. A breeze blew past, and a few bamboo leaves fluttered. As her sleeves fluttered slightly, one could vaguely see her fair skin and graceful figure.</p>
<p>Although it was just her back view, it was already infinitely beautiful.</p>
<p>“So beautiful!” Even as a woman, Ji Moqing couldn’t help but be attracted by the woman’s back.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also sizing up the woman, but his focus wasn’t on her beauty or figure. He had been sensing her aura, but no matter how hard he sensed, she was a living woman without any dimensional creature aura.</p>
<p>There are still humans on this island? Zhou Wen frowned slightly.</p>
<p>When they approached the bridge, the woman finally turned around. Her face seemed to be filled with joy and anger, and there was a hint of delicateness in her softness.</p>
<p>“Why are you here? Don’t you know that Bride Island is very dangerous?” the woman said worriedly when she saw Zhou Wen and Ji Moqing.</p>
<p>“What danger can there be? Aren’t you here too?” Ji Moqing asked.</p>
<p>“I’m different from you. I’m trapped here and can’t leave. It’s best you leave quickly. Otherwise, when night falls, I’m afraid you won’t be able to escape death,” the woman on the bridge said.</p>
<p>“Why are you trapped here? Who trapped you here?” Ji Moqing asked again.</p>
<p>“It’s a dimensional creature with a lute on his back. However, this has nothing to do with you. Leave Bride Island quickly before it turns dark,” the woman on the bridge said.</p>
<p>“We want to leave, but the entire island is enveloped by a spatial rift. We can’t leave either,” Ji Moqing said.</p>
<p>At fixed distances along the way, Zhou Wen would use the Poison Bats to probe, but none of them had managed to escape. Ji Moqing naturally had seen all of this.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>“Walk forward from here. After passing through the bamboo forest, you will see a mountain. Go around the mountain from the left. There’s a ferry crossing behind. If you leave Bride Island from there, you won’t encounter the spatial rift,” the woman on the bridge said.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing looked at Zhou Wen. Clearly, she couldn’t tell if the woman on the bridge was telling the truth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sized up the woman. He had already tried using many skills to look at her, but they all showed that she was human. However, Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Previously, the dimensional creature had said to be careful of the woman on the bridge, but this woman had said that the dimensional creature with the lute had imprisoned her here. It was unknown who was lying.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and ignored the woman on the bridge as he continued walking forward.</p>
<p>“How did you get trapped here? Can you leave with us?” Ji Moqing couldn’t bear to leave the woman behind and asked.</p>
<p>“Unless the dimensional creature with the lute on his back is killed, I won’t be able to leave this bridge. It’s just too difficult. He’s a Terror-grade dimensional creature. You are far from his match. It’s best you leave quickly. If you are going to Nankai Island in the future, please inform my parents and tell them not to worry about me. I’m fine here. There’s no danger to my life,” the woman said.</p>
<p>“Why did that dimensional creature trap you here? Why didn’t he kill you?” Ji Moqing continued asking.</p>
<p>“Beauty is a woman’s greatest sin.” The woman sighed and didn’t explain much. Then, she urged Zhou Wen and Ji Moqing to leave quickly. “It’s getting late. Leave quickly. Otherwise, there won’t be a chance to leave after dark.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go,” Zhou Wen said indifferently as he continued walking forward.</p>
<p>He’s indeed a cold-blooded devil, Ji Moqing couldn’t help but think.</p>
<p>Despite encountering his own kind, and such a beautiful woman at that, Zhou Wen had no intention of saving her. Only devils would do such a thing.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing was only at the Mortal stage and didn’t have the ability to save the woman. All she could do was bid farewell to the woman and continue walking forward with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The woman stood on the bridge and watched them leave, but she didn’t do anything abnormal.</p>
<p>After walking for a short distance, they heard someone behind them. Ji Moqing turned her head and saw that the bald officer who had followed Fang Mingsu had brought a few people to the vicinity of the wooden bridge.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing was delighted. The bald officer was a Mythical expert. Perhaps he could save the woman.</p>
<p>It didn’t seem as if they had encountered the dimensional creature with the lute on its back. When they arrived in front of the wooden bridge, they exchanged a few words with the woman. A few soldiers went over to rescue the woman.</p>
<p>However, just as the soldiers stepped onto the wooden bridge, a strange wind gushed out of thin air, sweeping the soldiers into the river.</p>
<p>The river didn’t seem deep, but after a few soldiers fell in, they couldn’t crawl out. They were all Epic existences. Ignoring the fact that they knew how to swim, even if they didn’t, it shouldn’t have been difficult for them to get out of the water.</p>
<p>However, not only did they fail to break out of the water, but they also began sinking deeper and deeper as they struggled with all their might. They were about to sink completely.</p>
<p>The soldiers on the riverside wanted to save them, but be it their Companion Beasts or themselves, as long as they approached the river, they would be swept into the river by the strange wind.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing immediately realized that something was amiss. She looked at the woman on the bridge in disappointment and secretly rejoiced. If she hadn’t been with a cold-blooded devil like Zhou Wen, she would probably have drowned in the river.</p>
<p>The bald officer also realized that there was something wrong with the woman. Relying on the fact that he had fused with a Mythical creature, the scales on his body rapidly grew. He held a huge ax in his hand as he leaped up and slashed at the woman on the bridge.</p>
<p>The woman didn’t dodge. She only looked at the bald officer with a delicate look.</p>
<p>The bald officer was quite steel-hearted. He remained unmoved as he cleaved down with his ax.</p>
<p>However, the ax which was formed by a Mythical Companion Beast failed to slice apart the thin paper umbrella. Instead, it was held motionless in midair.</p>
<p>The woman smiled at the bald officer and spun the paper umbrella in her hand. The bald officer was immediately swept into the river by a strange wind.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1128'>Chapter 1128: Birthplace of the Calamity</h3>
<p>The river didn’t seem to be more than a meter or two deep, but even a Mythical expert like the bald officer could only struggle with all his might when he fell in. He couldn’t escape no matter how hard he tried and was about to fully sink at any moment.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a voice came from the bamboo forest beside him. “Among the ghosts of a Ghost Parade, there’s a ghost named Hashihime—Bridge Lady. She stands by the bridge, and if a man is tempted by her, he will be lured into the river where he will drown. I believe you are that Hashihime?”</p>
<p>“Brother-in-law…” Ji Moqing was overjoyed when she heard the voice. She looked in the direction of the voice and saw Fang Mingsu walking out of the bamboo forest.</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu’s gaze was firm. He wore golden armor and emitted a dazzling golden light like the sun. As he spoke, he approached the wooden bridge. When the golden light shone on Hashihime, she let out a tragic cry as white smoke emitted from her body.</p>
<p>The woman hurriedly used the paper umbrella to block the golden light from Fang Mingsu’s body, but the golden light seemed to have a strong restraining effect on her. Wherever the golden light shone, not only Hashihime, but even the wooden bridge and river water began to emit white fog.</p>
<p>Hashihime glared fiercely at Fang Mingsu. Her body suddenly turned into white fog and vanished along with the wooden bridge and river.</p>
<p>On a second look, there was no river. The bald officer and company were struggling on the grass. After realizing their predicament, they stood up and looked at each other, unsure if they had been hallucinating.</p>
<p>“Brother-in-law!” Ji Moqing looked at Fang Mingsu as though she had found a backer. She stopped praising Zhou Wen and turned to run towards him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally didn’t stop her. He found Ji Moqing a burden to begin with—he had only brought her along on account that she was a fellow human.</p>
<p>Since she had already found a powerful relative like Fang Mingsu, Zhou Wen naturally couldn’t be bothered with her. He continued walking forward.</p>
<p>“Devil, why aren’t you acting all fierce now? Are you afraid of my brother-in-law?” Ji Moqing pulled a face and shouted at Zhou Wen’s back, “You aren’t handsome at all. You don’t have any poise. You’re just a cold-blooded devil.”</p>
<p>She had been disgusted by her praise of Zhou Wen. It wasn’t easy for her to find someone to rely on. If she didn’t deliver him a few sarcastic remarks, she would feel terrible.</p>
<p>“Little Qing, stop it.” Fang Mingsu stopped her from continuing.</p>
<p>“He’s most afraid of you. With you around, he wouldn’t dare do anything to me,” Ji Moqing said.</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu shook his head and said, “I’m afraid you are mistaken. If he really wants to deal with me, it would be impossible for him to easily let you return to my side. If he wants you to return, it means that he has no intention of fighting with us.”</p>
<p>With that said, Fang Mingsu shouted in Zhou Wen’s direction, “Friend, thank you for taking care of Little Qing. If you don’t mind, why don’t you travel with us?”</p>
<p>“There’s no need,” Zhou Wen said as he left without looking back.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only wanted to find Shiraishi Satomi quickly. It was too dangerous here. Sei Gasakai had requested Shiraishi Satomi to accompany him. It wasn’t nice for him to go back and tell him that his disciple was dead, right?</p>
<p>However, not long after Zhou Wen walked out, he heard a strange sound coming from the village.</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu and company also heard the sound. They turned their heads and saw the village in the fog suddenly become clearer.</p>
<p>Standing here, they could roughly see the situation in the village.</p>
<p>Just the parts they could see were filled with strange dimensional creatures. They looked like demons and ghosts with all kinds of appearances.</p>
<p>Hashihime was also among them. However, at that moment, she was prostrating on the ground with the other demons and ghosts. They were all kneeling in the middle of the village.</p>
<p>They had already experienced the horror of Hashihime. For such a powerful dimensional creature to prostrate on the ground without even daring to raise her head, what was she bowing to?</p>
<p>Everyone, including Zhou Wen, couldn’t help but look in the direction where the demons and ghosts were prostrating. It was also the center of the village.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen and company didn’t discover any terrifying creatures. In the middle of the village was an empty space. Most of the area was empty except for a well.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that the strange sound was coming from the well.</p>
<p>“That’s bad. This is the birthplace of the Calamity creature. We need to go.” Fang Mingsu’s expression suddenly changed drastically. He retreated as he pulled Ji Moqing. The bald officer and company hurriedly followed Fang Mingsu.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was too late for them to leave. Large numbers of dimensional creatures had already appeared on the surrounding bamboo forests and beaches.</p>
<p>The dimensional creatures looked strange, but their levels weren’t low. They were at least at the Epic stage, and there were even Mythical creatures.</p>
<p>The most powerful ones were the man who carried the lute on his back and Hashihime.</p>
<p>There were still many ghosts in the village that hadn’t come out. The most powerful one had a face that resembled an evil ghost. It had a long nose and wings on its back. It looked like a mythical Daitengu.</p>
<p>Behind the Daitengu was a white-haired woman in a snow-white kimono. Her body floated as snowflakes danced around her. She looked like the legendary Yuki Onna—snow woman.</p>
<p>“Daitengu, Yuki Onna, Hashihime, and Umibōzu. I’m afraid this is really the birthplace of the Calamity creature… Could that well be where the Calamity creature is?” the bald officer said in shock.</p>
<p>“Stay close to me.” Fang Mingsu pulled Ji Moqing. The Guardian armor on his body glowed with golden light. Wherever the golden light went, the ghosts retreated. If they retreated any slower, they would be burned to ashes by the golden light.</p>
<p>The Guardian’s power is extreme Yang in nature. It’s indeed the nemesis of ghosts. It’s no wonder Honn Shinsakura wants to use Fang Mingsu to deal with the ghosts. Zhou Wen sized it up and guessed which race Fang Mingsu’s Guardian came from.</p>
<p>Without needing to guess, he quickly knew where Fang Mingsu’s Guardian originated.</p>
<p>Although the golden light on Fang Mingsu’s body was extremely effective against ghosts, the four Terror-grade creatures like the Daitengu and the Yuki Onna weren’t too afraid. They surrounded Fang Mingsu.</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu had no choice but to go all out when fighting four adversaries. Soon, he revealed all his strength.</p>
<p>Seeing the familiar golden flames ignite on Fang Mingsu’s body as he resisted the four Terror creatures, Zhou Wen immediately recognized that it was identical to the phoenix flames of the phoenix chick.</p>
<p>Could it be that the Guardian Fang Mingsu obtained is the one Chick’s mother is guarding? It’s no wonder he can become one of the four war gods of the new era. Zhou Wen had reared Chick for so long and had a deep understanding of a phoenix’s might.</p>
<p>If Fang Mingsu really obtained the Phoenix race’s Guardian, his strength definitely wouldn’t be too weak.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1129'>Chapter 1129: Birth</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen secretly circulated the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra as invisible karmic sinflames emitted from his body. The ghosts didn’t dare approach him.</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu and company were besieged, but Zhou Wen was leisurely sitting on the bamboo watching the battle.</p>
<p>Yuki Onna‘s abilities were very similar to Ice Maiden’s, and their battle prowess was also very close.</p>
<p>Of Hashihime and Umibōzu who had a lute on his back, one appeared and disappeared unpredictably. The other delivered aural attacks. As for the Daitengu, not only did it possess both strength and speed, but it was also proficient in curse-type powers.</p>
<p>The four Terror-grade creatures attacked Fang Mingsu together. Even though the phoenix flames were very effective against Yin-attribute dimensional creatures, he was still at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>The soldiers were in an even worse state. Fang Mingsu was no longer able to take care of them. Just the shockwaves from the Terror-grade battle killed more than half of them.</p>
<p>Only the baldy and a few powerful ones rushed out of the danger zone, but they found themselves in an endless sea of ghosts. It was only a matter of time before they died.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t save them. Not because he didn’t want to save them, but that there was no hope.</p>
<p>No matter how powerful the phoenix flames were, no matter how strong Fang Mingsu was, he was only at the Terror grade. Power at the Calamity grade surged out from the well. The terrifying Yin aura was endless like a tidal wave, greatly augmenting the ghosts. Even if they were killed, they would constantly regenerate amidst the Yin aura.</p>
<p>The Calamity creature was about to be born. If Zhou Wen didn’t escape Bride Island quickly, he would probably be in danger, much less be able to save the others.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the Earth Elemental Beast and used Earth Escape to quickly move around the island in search of Shiraishi Satomi.</p>
<p>Now, all the ghosts were attracted to Fang Mingsu and company. The powerful ghosts no longer had the time or energy to deal with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Bride Island was filled with ghost creatures. Before long, Zhou Wen found Shiraishi Satomi, who was fighting the ghosts.</p>
<p>Shiraishi Satomi’s attainments in the sword were extremely high. Furthermore, her abilities had hints of Transcendent Flying Immortal. She stormed through the horde of ghosts and killed many dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, she was still at the Epic stage. After encountering a Mythical monster, she was unable to keep up. She was greatly suppressed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked towards Shiraishi Satomi as the Great Brahma aura on his body revealed itself slightly. The ghosts around him immediately retreated as though they had encountered poisonous creatures like snakes or scorpions. They didn’t dare stand in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen arrived in front of Shiraishi Satomi, the ghosts had already retreated to a distance of a hundred meters. None of them dared to rush forward—even those at the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>“I’m fine.” Shiraishi Satomi looked at Zhou Wen before looking at the retreating dimensional creatures with an abnormal expression.</p>
<p>“That’s good. Let’s go.” Zhou Wen led Shiraishi Satomi to the beach. Even if he couldn’t find a way to break out of the spatial rift, he had to force his way out. Otherwise, he could only wait for death.</p>
<p>When he had killed Di Tian, the Immortal Culling Sword Sword had nearly taken Zhou Wen’s life. He didn’t want another repeat.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen already knew that the Di Tian he had killed was only an avatar. The real Di Tian had been killed by Wang Mingyuan’s sneak attack.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen led Shiraishi Satomi along the coast, but unfortunately, they didn’t find a way out. It was as though all the places were enveloped by spatial rifts, preventing them from leaving.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>In the village, a terrifying Yin aura surged into the sky like a volcanic eruption, instantly turning the sky black. It was clearly daytime, but it now looked like night.</p>
<p>“The Calamity creature is about to appear…” Shiraishi Satomi’s expression changed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned slightly. He knew that it wasn’t realistic to find a way out. The only way was to use force.</p>
<p>Striking a spatial rift with force was definitely unrealistic. A spatial rift was equivalent to a blade pointing out. The faster one charged, the faster they would die.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s so-called use of force was actually to use a trick. It wasn’t a reckless charge.</p>
<p>After circulating the Godfiend Era, Zhou Wen engraved a clown-like symbol on the Wheel of Destiny. This symbol represented the Godfiend Life Providence and the New Era Life Soul. It had a strange spatial power.</p>
<p>Just spatial powers weren’t enough for Zhou Wen to rush out of Bride Island that was covered in spatial rifts.</p>
<p>Let me see if space here has really been completely sealed. Zhou Wen extended his finger and the clown ring appeared on his finger. At the same time, the clown’s eyes flashed with a strange and warped light.</p>
<p>As the power of the clown ring was released, the spatial fluctuations on the ring became more and more intense, as though it was about to resonate with the spatial rifts on Bride Island.</p>
<p>At that moment, he suddenly saw a golden beam flash in the sky. A golden figure flew over like a comet.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The golden ball of light landed on the beach. It was Fang Mingsu, who was hugging Ji Moqing.</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu was in terrible condition. The Guardian armor on his body had already cracked in many places. Blood constantly seeped out from the cracks. It looked like his injuries were not light.</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu suddenly threw Ji Moqing, who was in his arms, at Zhou Wen. At the same time, he said, “I’ll hold them back and give you time to escape. If you can escape, take her with you.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid you can’t hold on any longer.” Zhou Wen looked in the direction of the well and could already sense that there was an extremely terrifying creature accompanying the Yin aura.</p>
<p>As for the four Terror-grade creatures, they had already caught up. Under the augmentation of the endless Yin aura, Daitengu, Yuki Onna, Hashihime, and Umibōzu‘s strength were greatly augmented. It was very unlikely for Fang Mingsu to match them.</p>
<p>“I’ll hold them back, but it won’t be for long.” As Fang Mingsu spoke, the phoenix flames on his body rose again. He was like a phoenix that had been reborn from the flames of nirvana. The wounds on his body rapidly healed as his vitality increased greatly.</p>
<p>Soon, Ji Moqing could no longer see Fang Mingsu. All she could see was a golden flame that resembled a phoenix dancing in the black sky.</p>
<p>The fire phoenix charged between the four Terror creatures and forcefully suppressed them. The ordinary ghosts around them were reduced to ashes by the phoenix flames. It was unimaginably terrifying.</p>
<p>The phoenixes’ Guardian is indeed terrifying. He can actually produce such terrifying strength in such a harsh environment. Although Zhou Wen felt that Fang Mingsu was indeed very strong, he didn’t believe that he could stall for too long.</p>
<p>This was because Zhou Wen had already sensed that the Calamity creature in the well had been born.</p>
<p>At that moment, a figure slowly emerged from the ancient well.</p>
<p>The flaming phoenix that Fang Mingsu had transformed into danced wildly. Wherever it passed, golden flames would destroy the world. The Yuki Onna was restrained too much and could no longer participate in the battle.</p>
<p>Daitengu‘s hair and beard were charred black, making it look extremely pathetic.</p>
<p>Hashihime and Umibōzu couldn’t approach Fang Mingsu either. Instantly, Fang Mingsu suppressed the four Terror-grade creatures with his own strength. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but marvel at how powerful the phoenixes were.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the clown ring on Zhou Wen’s finger kept flickering, but it was still a little short of taking the final step for the breakthrough.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a white figure walked over from the ancient well. It looked like it was walking very slowly, but in the blink of an eye, it had already appeared on the battlefield.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1130'>Chapter 1130: Nirvana</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen could clearly see that the white figure that came out of the ancient well was a woman with silver hair and eyes like the moon.</p>
<p>In the woman’s arms was a saber. The hilt and scabbard were pitch-black, forming a stark contrast to her white clothes.</p>
<p>​ </p>
<p>The woman’s expression was cold. She looked at Fang Mingsu, who was fighting the four Terror-grade creatures, as though she was looking at a dead person.</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu completely unleashed the power of a Guardian. Just as he gained the upper hand—</p>
<p>The saber in the silver-haired, white-robed woman’s arms suddenly moved. Zhou Wen only saw a saber flash. Even with his eyesight, he couldn’t see the trajectory of the saber clearly. All he saw was a crescent blade flash before his eyes. In the next second, the phoenix-like Fang Mingsu was sent flying.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu crashed to the ground. The golden armor on his body shattered. The Terror-grade Guardian armor was completely destroyed.</p>
<p>On Fang Mingsu’s chest, a bone-deep wound could be seen. Blood was rapidly gushing out.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s surprise, after Fang Mingsu’s armor shattered, the clothes were also mostly destroyed. What appeared in his vision was a female body.</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu is a woman? Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>Although Fang Mingsu looked a little delicate, her actions were very masculine. Furthermore, Ji Moqing kept calling her brother-in-law. Zhou Wen hadn’t read too much into it.</p>
<p>He never expected Ji Moqing’s brother-in-law to be a woman.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen looked at Ji Moqing, he realized that she was also alarmed. She stared at Fang Mingsu with widened eyes as though she couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to figure out why Fang Mingsu was a woman. He pulled Ji Moqing and teleported away.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether Fang Mingsu was a woman or a man, she was doomed. Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t take the risk to save her. Escape was the most important thing now.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen hoped that the dimensional creature that had crawled out of the ancient well would quickly leave Earth and head to space like Sei Gasakai had said.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen soon realized gloomily that the woman didn’t continue pursuing the heavily injured Fang Mingsu. She had cast her gaze at Zhou Wen and walked towards him.</p>
<p>As the entire island was enveloped by spatial rifts, Zhou Wen was unable to teleport out. All he could do was teleport elsewhere on the island and distance himself from the woman.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen teleported out, he was immediately alarmed to discover that the woman had already arrived in front of him. She was looking at him with her emotionless eyes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately teleported again. Furthermore, he constantly teleported. After teleporting a few times, Zhou Wen saw the situation in front of him clearly. His heart chilled as goosebumps rose all over his body.</p>
<p>That woman actually appeared in front of him again and looked at him coldly.</p>
<p>I’ve been trapped for too long. I actually forgot that something happens every time I enter a dimensional zone. If I had known this would happen, I wouldn’t have come to this darn place even if I’d be beaten to death. Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed as he threw Shiraishi Satomi and Ji Moqing in different directions, allowing them to escape.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Wen himself, he knew that he had been targeted by the strange dimensional creature in front of him. Since he couldn’t escape Bride Island, he could only risk his life.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Demonic Neonate and Banana Fairy had already recovered while he was trapped. With the Mourning Stick and Immortal Culling Sword still around, Zhou Wen didn’t lack the capital to go all out.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s aura erupted as Great Brahma appeared in front of him. The Mourning Stick also appeared in his hand.</p>
<p>Immortal Culling Sword was too dangerous. He would basically be crippled with each use. Even if he could kill this terrifying female dimensional creature, Zhou Wen might not be able to escape alive.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen wanted to stall for time, hoping that she would lose her patience and leave Earth as soon as possible.</p>
<p>After Ji Moqing was sent flying by Zhou Wen, she gritted her teeth and ran in the direction where Fang Mingsu had fallen. Although she knew that Fang Mingsu was probably doomed, she still wanted to take a look.</p>
<p>After Shiraishi Satomi landed, she didn’t choose to escape. Instead, she held her blade as though she wanted to put her life on the line.</p>
<p>“Don’t come over. You will only affect my battle.” Zhou Wen’s voice dispelled her intention to immediately attack. However, she didn’t plan on escaping. She continued searching for opportunities nearby.</p>
<p>The woman suspected to be at the Calamity Grade stared at Zhou Wen as she slowly walked over. It was unknown when the saber in her arms would be unsheathed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, golden phoenix flames rose from Fang Mingsu’s direction.</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu, whose Guardian armor was almost completely shattered, was surrounded by a group of dimensional creatures. Just as she was about to be dismembered, terrifying phoenix flames suddenly erupted around her. Any dimensional creature that approached Fang Mingsu was burned to ashes. Even Yuki Onna and the other three Terror-grade creatures suffered some injuries and retreated far away to dodge the phoenix flames.</p>
<p>A phoenix cry resounded through the clouds. The phoenix flames that filled the sky transformed into a Phoenix that circled around Fang Mingsu a few times before flying towards her body.</p>
<p>As the Fire Phoenix fused into her body, the shattered Guardian armor on Fang Mingsu’s body rapidly recovered amidst phoenix flames. Soon, it formed brand new golden armor.</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu was bathed in phoenix flames. The power that erupted from her body was even stronger than back when she had given her all.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu’s figure flew across the sky like a Phoenix. She was unbelievably fast.</p>
<p>Daitengu was actually unable to dodge her punch. Under its forceful resistance, it was sent flying by Fang Mingsu’s punch. The clothes on its body and the feathers on its back burned. Daitengu circulated its strength, but it was unable to extinguish the phoenix flames on its body.</p>
<p>In the end, it could only cut off the burning part in a sacrificial act.</p>
<p>Yuki Onna, Hashihime, and Umibōzu all surrounded her, but this time, their siege seemed even more powerless in front of Fang Mingsu. In just a moment, they were beaten back by her.</p>
<p>Firstly, it was because the phoenix flames were very effective against ghost-type dimensional creatures. Secondly, it was because after her Guardian armor underwent Nirvana Rebirth, the might it could produce was much stronger than before.</p>
<p>Among those who could become strong in such a way, Li Xuan was an example Zhou Wen had seen before Fang Mingsu.</p>
<p>However, she was different from Li Xuan. Fang Mingsu couldn’t learn the techniques of others. Her strengthening only made her Guardian armor stronger.</p>
<p>The woman suspected to be a Calamity seemed to be attracted by Fang Mingsu’s gaze as she didn’t continue walking towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>On the other side, Fang Mingsu had beaten back the Yuki Onna and the others. She began a massacre as though she had entered a no man’s land. The phoenix flames on her body became more and more intense, almost turning half of Bride Island into a sea of flames.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing couldn’t help but be overjoyed when she saw that not only was Fang Mingsu still alive, but that she had become even stronger.</p>
<p>However, before she could run over, Fang Mingsu had already charged towards the woman who was suspected to be a Calamity with a sea of flames.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1131'>Chapter 1131: Spatial Stillness</h3>
<p>Fang Mingsu also knew that if they wanted to escape Bride Island, they had to defeat that woman. Otherwise, even if they killed all the dimensional creatures here, there was no chance of survival.</p>
<p>Back then, Human Sovereign could defeat the Calamity-grade powerhouse, Di Tian. Brother-in-law can do the same. Ji Moqing secretly prayed for Fang Mingsu.</p>
<p>However, when she thought that Fang Mingsu was actually a woman, Ji Moqing’s expression became complicated.</p>
<p>How could Fang Mingsu not want to defy the heavens and change her fate like Human Sovereign did and defeat a Calamity-grade dimensional creature? Furthermore, she had to do it, or death was the only outcome.</p>
<p>When the woman looked at the flames and Fang Mingsu, her eyes remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The phoenix flames on Fang Mingsu’s body grew stronger and stronger. The flames on her back engulfed the world like a pair of phoenix wings that covered the sky. As Fang Mingsu threw a punch, the phoenix flames that filled the sky also cascaded down like a waterfall.</p>
<p>When the phoenix flames arrived in front of her, the woman finally moved again. The pitch-black saber in her arms was unsheathed once more as a beam of moonlight flashed.</p>
<p>The phoenix flames that filled the sky were instantly shattered, and Fang Mingsu’s armor was slashed apart again.</p>
<p>However, the injured Fang Mingsu didn’t fall again. The phoenix flames on her body rapidly healed her shattered armor. The wings on her back spread out and she attacked the woman from another direction.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing’s heart felt like it was on a roller coaster, unable to settle down as the situation developed.</p>
<p>However, when she saw the woman slash at Fang Mingsu again, and how she had recovered each time, Ji Moqing’s hope was gradually ignited.</p>
<p>He can do it; he definitely can do it. If Human Sovereign can defeat Di Tian, Brother-in-law can definitely defeat this Calamity-grade creature… Ji Moqing thought excitedly.</p>
<p>However, just as she had this thought, she suddenly saw an unbelievable scene.</p>
<p>When Fang Mingsu attacked the woman again, the woman didn’t continue drawing her saber. However, the pupils in her eyes were like the moon, constantly evolving into crescent moons hidden behind dark clouds.</p>
<p>In the next moment, something unbelievable happened. Everything around them seemed to freeze.</p>
<p>The rising flames turned still. Fang Mingsu, who was flying in the air, was also frozen in place. Ji Moqing, who had her mouth agape in shock, maintained that posture the entire time. She couldn’t even move her eyes.</p>
<p>The whole of Bride Island seemed to become a painting, including the other dimensional creatures. Everything became still as though it was a lifeless painting.</p>
<p>Only the woman was alive and could walk in the painting.</p>
<p>She walked to Fang Mingsu’s side, who was covered in flames. She extended her finger and pinched the frozen phoenix flames. With a casual rip, the motionless phoenix flames were torn off and thrown to the side by the woman.</p>
<p>The woman moved her fingers again, and the phoenix flames around Fang Mingsu’s body were completely torn apart. Then, there was her Guardian armor, her clothes, and finally…</p>
<p>Everyone remained conscious and they could see everything, but for some reason, their bodies couldn’t move.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing watched helplessly as Fang Mingsu’s armor was torn off. She was already in despair.</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu was very strong, but she had borrowed the power of the Guardian armor. Now, even the Guardian armor had been casually torn off by the woman and thrown to the ground like trash. One could imagine Fang Mingsu’s outcome.</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu was very calm. She knew that she no longer had a chance. She felt somewhat relieved. “I should have died more than twenty years ago. To be able to live for another twenty more years is already a blessing from the heavens.”</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu wanted to close her eyes and wait for death to descend, but in the Calamity domain, she didn’t even have the ability to close her eyes.</p>
<p>The woman’s finger reached out to Fang Mingsu again. Now, there was nothing left on Fang Mingsu’s body. If she continued tearing, the only thing that could be torn off was her flesh.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a strange force spread out on the picturesque Bride Island like layers of ripples.</p>
<p>The woman’s fingers paused for a moment. She didn’t extend her hand towards Fang Mingsu as she turned to look at the center of the ripples.</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu and Ji Moqing happened to be facing that direction—they saw that in the middle of the ripples was Zhou Wen, who was standing far away.</p>
<p>Ripples spread out from Zhou Wen’s body as though space had turned into water.</p>
<p>In this motionless space, Zhou Wen’s fingers moved slightly. Every movement of his fingers caused a ripple in space.</p>
<p>As his fingers moved faster and faster, the range and fluctuations of the ripples increased.</p>
<p>In the end, it wasn’t just his fingers. Zhou Wen’s arms, body, and legs gradually moved as though a character in a painting was gradually gaining life.</p>
<p>It only took a few seconds from the initial clumsy movements to the gradual freedom of movement.</p>
<p>How… How is that possible… Fang Mingsu looked at Zhou Wen as though she had seen a ghost.</p>
<p>Her Guardian, Nirvana, was already at the Terror grade, and it could be considered a top-notch existence among Terror-grade creatures. However, it still couldn’t resist the woman’s Calamity Domain.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t have any Guardian armor on him. Nor could she sense the aura of a dimensional creature, much less any signs of fusing with a Guardian.</p>
<p>No matter how she looked at it, his body was purely human. However, Fang Mingsu had no way of believing that he was really a human.</p>
<p>There was still no precedent to date, of any human relying on their own strength to advance to the Mythical stage when it came to human evolution on Earth.</p>
<p>Ignoring the Terror grade, there wasn’t a single pure human among the known Mythical humans. They either relied on Guardians to advance to the Mythical stage or used Mythical Serum.</p>
<p>Now, to suddenly be informed that a human could rely on his own strength to resist the Calamity Domain, Fang Mingxiu found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>Even though she saw it with her own eyes, she still found it unreal.</p>
<p>However, things were slowly happening in front of her. In the Calamity Domain where even the Terror-grade Nirvana couldn’t move, Zhou Wen had completely regained his freedom. However, his actions looked extremely slow, as though he was walking in the deep sea.</p>
<p>On his finger that could move at first, a clown ring was emitting intense spatial fluctuations.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The ring shattered as the clown ring’s surface slowly rose. As it rose, it constantly expanded and finally transformed into a clown mask that covered Zhou Wen’s face.</p>
<p>The moment the clown mask completely fused with Zhou Wen’s face, his body became extremely relaxed as though he had returned to the land from the deep sea.</p>
<p>The Calamity Domain with spatial powers was unable to restrain his body or affect his actions.</p>
<p>The clown mask wore a smile. It was evil, crazy, bloodthirsty, and filled with hope.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1132'>Chapter 1132: He’s Human Sovereign?</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen felt the power of Godfiend Era spread through his body as the clown symbol on the Wheel of Destiny became clearer. Through the clown mask, the world he could see was somewhat different.</p>
<p>The woman glanced at Zhou Wen and waved her hand. She wanted to tear Fang Mingsu’s body apart.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen teleported in front of the woman and reached out for her face.</p>
<p>The woman stretched out her hand to block Zhou Wen. She was much faster than him, but when her hand touched his hand, it hit nothing. Zhou Wen vanished in front of her eyes.</p>
<p>The woman seemed to realize something. When she turned her head, she realized that Fang Mingsu had vanished.</p>
<p>When she turned around, she realized that Shiraishi Satomi and Ji Moqing had also disappeared.</p>
<p>On Fangzhang Island, Fang Mingsu and Shiraishi Satomi stood by the coast. Zhou Wen’s figure appeared again as he threw Ji Moqing to the ground.</p>
<p>After Godfiend Era’s Terror transformation, Zhou Wen’s understanding of space had broken through to an extremely high realm. The spatial rifts on Bride Island couldn’t trap him anymore.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, not only did his teleportation range greatly increase, but there were almost no restrictions. He could continuously teleport without limit.</p>
<p>“Everyone, run for your lives. I need to escape as well.” With that said, Zhou Wen teleported away, not daring to stay for a moment.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that he didn’t want to take Shiraishi Satomi back to Fuji Island, but the Calamity creature was also a spatial-type creature. If she could teleport from afar, taking Shiraishi Satomi back to Fuji Island would be equivalent to bringing destruction to it if she were to track him down.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen had taken them to the uninhabited Fangzhang Island before letting them leave by themselves. When that happened, even if the Calamity creature chased after them, she would only track Zhou Wen himself.</p>
<p>“Take us with you!” Ji Moqing shouted twice, but no one answered her.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t need to escape,” Fang Mingsu with her restored Guardian-armored said thoughtfully as she looked at the spot where Zhou Wen had vanished.</p>
<p>“No need to escape? Why? Didn’t he already escape?” Ji Moqing asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen could save them and was indeed very powerful, a Calamity-grade creature was a Calamity-grade creature. Even if humans could escape one, it was difficult for them to fight one.</p>
<p>“Because he’s Human Sovereign, sovereign of all humans. He’s an existence that has slain a Calamity. There’s no need for him to escape,” Fang Mingsu said with certainty.</p>
<p>“He’s Human Sovereign? Impossible. Isn’t he an overseas devil? How can he be Human Sovereign?” Ji Moqing was momentarily unable to digest the information Fang Mingsu had given her as she spoke incoherently.</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu glanced at Shiraishi Satomi and continued, “I’ve been paying attention to him. Earlier on, I saw him take out a white wooden stick. It’s identical to the white wooden stick that Human Sovereign used when he fought Di Tian. I thought it was just a resemblance, but from the looks of it, it’s not just that. It’s the same wooden stick.”</p>
<p>“He’s Human Sovereign?” Ji Moqing repeated what she had said in a daze. She really couldn’t connect the great devil with Human Sovereign that quickly.</p>
<p>“It can’t be wrong. I originally thought that the claim that Human Sovereign was pure human was nothing more than humanity’s self-consolation. It’s impossible for such a thing to happen. Now, it looks like I was wrong. Human Sovereign is actually a pure human. It’s hard to imagine how he did it. A pure human advancing to the Mythical stage can actually be done. Furthermore, he did so five years ago.” Fang Mingsu looked at Shiraishi Satomi as though she wanted to hear what she had to say.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Shiraishi Satomi didn’t know anything. She was still awash with adrenaline and had nothing to say.</p>
<p>“He’s Human Sovereign… Then he’s going…” Ji Moqing’s mind cleared up as she thought of a possibility.</p>
<p>“That’s right. He must have gone to kill that Calamity creature to prevent her from bringing disaster to the human world.” Fang Mingsu sighed and said, “Over the years, I thought I had done very well. I could be considered somewhat accomplished among humans, but compared to Human Sovereign, I’m nothing. I really never expected Human Sovereign to be a pure-blooded human, and he’s so young.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t he an old monster who has some way to retain his youth?” Ji Moqing had always felt that Zhou Wen only looked young, but was actually an old man in person. Otherwise, how could he have such a powerful cultivation level?</p>
<p>“Of course not. My Nirvana Guardian is most sensitive to vital energies. Although he looks very accomplished—something expected from age—he is still a very young life. He’s actually not that old. He’s only in his early twenties,” Fang Mingsu said after some thought.</p>
<p>“In his early twenties… That’s impossible… How old was he when he defeated Di Tian five years ago?” Ji Moqing thought about it carefully and felt that what Fang Mingsu said was too fantastic. It didn’t make sense at all.</p>
<p>“Although I’m equally unwilling to believe it, the truth is right in front of us. When he defeated Di Tian, he was probably not even twenty years old,” Fang Mingsu said with a sigh.</p>
<p>She originally believed that she was already considered a top genius among humans, but after seeing Zhou Wen, she realized that so-called geniuses were nothing.</p>
<p>“Less than twenty years old… Is there really such a human in this world? Is he really Human Sovereign?” Ji Moqing looked out into the sea with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>“It’s very simple to know if he’s Human Sovereign. When a Calamity appears, it will definitely bring calamity to the world. Only Human Sovereign can kill a Calamity to stop the disaster,” Fang Mingsu said.</p>
<p>Ji Moqing’s eyes immediately lit up. “As long as we don’t see the appearance of a Calamity, it means it must have been killed. In other words, he’s really Human Sovereign?”</p>
<p>“Actually, there’s no need to go through so much trouble. He’s definitely Human Sovereign. Apart from Human Sovereign, who else can advance to the Mythical stage as a human? Who else can fight a Calamity-grade creature?” Fang Mingsu had already determined that Zhou Wen was Human Sovereign.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen knew that the three of them had seen through his identity and believed that he would kill the Calamity creature, he would probably be at a loss whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>He was really fleeing for his life. Godfiend Era’s Terror transformation was indeed very strong. Coupled with Slaughterer, he was capable of infinite teleportation. Even a Calamity-grade creature would find it difficult to kill him, but it was probably not a realistic thought that he could defeat a Calamity-grade creature.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen constantly teleported, hoping to escape back to the mainland. After a few teleportations, he was still out at sea when a figure suddenly appeared in front of him. It was none other than the newly born Calamity creature.</p>
<p>She still looked the same. She had long silver hair and white clothes. In her arms was a pitch-black saber. There was no emotion in her eyes.</p>
<p>She still managed to catch up? Can’t you leave Earth? Why are you chasing me? Zhou Wen grumbled inwardly as he used teleportation to escape again.</p>
<p>However, after a few teleportations, he still failed to shake off the Calamity creature.</p>
<p>The woman seemed to be attempting to use spatial powers to control him, but the Terror-form Clown Mask gave Zhou Wen spatial powers that allowed him to ignore the spatial seal. He couldn’t escape, but the woman couldn’t control him either.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to continue teleporting when he suddenly heard the woman speak.</p>
<p>“Marry me and I won’t kill you,” the woman said in all seriousness as she looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1133'>Chapter 1133: Let’s Get Married</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen was dumbfounded, unsure what was going on.</p>
<p>He had never been confessed to in his life, much less by a dimensional creature, even less a Calamity-grade dimensional creature.</p>
<p>Although the woman looked beautiful and had a strange charm that humans didn’t possess, Zhou Wen was a more traditional human. He found it unacceptable to have a love that transcended species.</p>
<p>“We don’t seem to be creatures of the same species, right?” Zhou Wen gave a measured response. He didn’t dare reject her too directly, afraid that he would anger this terrifying Calamity-grade existence.</p>
<p>If she flew into a rage out of humiliation and completely unleashed her Calamity-grade strength, even if Zhou Wen could escape through teleportation, a large area would probably be affected by the calamity.</p>
<p>“Will you marry me or not?” The woman was much more straightforward than Zhou Wen. She pulled out the crescent-like saber in her arms and pointed it at Zhou Wen. It was as though she would chop off his head if he said no.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hated being threatened, so he immediately teleported again. At most, he could use the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art to escape to other planets and return after the woman left Earth.</p>
<p>In the past, Zhou Wen hadn’t advanced to the Mythical stage, so his physique hadn’t been enough for him to survive in space. Now, with his Mythical body, as long as he didn’t encounter overly terrifying energy eruptions or radiation, surviving for a period of time wasn’t a problem.</p>
<p>After teleporting out, Zhou Wen’s expression suddenly changed. He found himself in front of the woman again. He had failed to appear where he wanted to go.</p>
<p>With the augmentation of Clown Mask, Zhou Wen saw that the surrounding space had become extremely strange. The sea and sky formed a line, intersecting and distorting the location of the moon. It transformed the nearby area into an independent space that resembled a Möbius loop.</p>
<p>This spatial connection was completely severed from the outside world. No matter how Zhou Wen teleported, he was still in this space and couldn’t leave.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen realize that this Calamity-grade woman was far more terrifying than he had imagined.</p>
<p>“Are you marrying me or not?” the woman continued pointing her saber at Zhou Wen as she asked expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“Ahem, why do you want me to marry you?” Zhou Wen felt that one shouldn’t be too hot-tempered. It was best to reason and negotiate.</p>
<p>The woman didn’t answer Zhou Wen’s question. She still pointed her saber at him and stared straight at him. Clearly, she only wanted an answer and didn’t wish to answer the question.</p>
<p>Seeing that the woman didn’t take action directly, Zhou Wen continued, “Legend has it that the bride on Bride Island married three brothers, but all three brothers died. Don’t tell me you are that legendary bride?”</p>
<p>The woman finally spoke. “How can the place where I live be a place where mortals live?”</p>
<p>Although the woman didn’t say if she was the bride, she had indirectly admitted that the myth did exist. The deaths of the three brothers were related to her.</p>
<p>“I’m also a mortal. Don’t tell me you want to marry me before killing me?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“No,” the woman answered with certainty.</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen pressed.</p>
<p>“Are you marrying me or not?” The woman clearly didn’t wish to answer this question as she once again forced Zhou Wen to give an answer.</p>
<p>“Since you wish to marry a human, you should at least follow human rules, right?” Zhou Wen wanted to stall for time to see if he could find a way to escape.</p>
<p>“We can get married immediately by doing the rites.” The woman clearly knew some human rules, but the rules she knew seemed to be ancient.</p>
<p>“Those are rules from the past. Things these days are different.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he attempted to use the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art to escape, but it was useless. The stars in the pocket universe were dim. In this strange space, it was clearly impossible to use interstellar teleportation.</p>
<p>“Oh, what are the rules now?” the woman asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“Rules these days talk about free love. If you want to get married, you have to fall in love with the other party first,” Zhou Wen said as he stalled for time.</p>
<p>The woman seemed to understand Zhou Wen’s words as she sheathed her saber.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen secretly heaved a sigh of relief, believing that he had finally convinced the woman. All he needed to do was find an excuse to escape from her.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, after she sheathed her sword, the woman began to take off her clothes and walk towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What are you doing…” Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>“Isn’t the so-called love of humans just lust? You said that you can only marry if you fall in love with the other party. I can do it now,” the woman said as she continued walking towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Stop. Who did you hear that from? It’s not like that at all.” Zhou Wen retreated as he called for a stop.</p>
<p>“What is it then?” the woman stopped and asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“That’s… That’s…” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and couldn’t think of something. All he could do was say what he could think of. “It’s just that the two of them need to understand each other and see if their personalities are compatible or if their thoughts are compatible…”</p>
<p>“Humans are still as hypocritical as ever,” the woman said with a frown. After a pause, she continued, “Then let’s get to understand each other. We shall get married after understanding each other. How do you want to understand me?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the woman in a daze, momentarily at a loss for words.</p>
<p>Understand? What the hell? Zhou Wen had no intention of dating a dimensional creature.</p>
<p>Ignoring dimensional creatures, even if a living person stood in front of Zhou Wen, he wouldn’t know how to date her, much less a terrifying Calamity-grade creature.</p>
<p>“That… That… Why don’t we watch a movie first…” Zhou Wen recalled that Li Xuan had once said that if he felt bored dating girls, he would take them to the movies. He had at least an hour and a half to relax or sleep.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that this wasn’t a bad idea. Perhaps he could take this opportunity to think of a way to escape this woman’s clutches.</p>
<p>“What’s a movie?” the woman asked with a frown.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen roughly explained what a movie was. The woman nodded. “Alright, let’s watch a movie.”</p>
<p>“Going to a movie is a very pleasant thing. If we end up covered in blood, it will affect our mood. Shouldn’t we restrain ourselves a little…” Zhou Wen was already beginning to regret taking a Calamity creature to a human city to catch a movie. Zhou Wen felt that this idea was too stupid. He didn’t know what was wrong with him to come up with such a stupid idea.</p>
<p>“It’s inauspicious to get married when there’s death. I understand,” the woman said calmly.</p>
<p>“I still don’t know your name?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.</p>
<p>“Tsukuyomi,” the woman answered.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1134'>Chapter 1134: Movie Etiquette</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly alarmed when he heard the name. He couldn’t help but carefully size up the woman.</p>
<p>When he had learned about the Ghost Parade previously, Zhou Wen had learned a little about the overseas myths. Although it wasn’t very detailed, Zhou Wen still knew a famous Mythical figure like Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>​ </p>
<p>Tsukuyomi was one of the three Supreme Gods of a certain pantheon overseas. Legend had it that she was one of the three children of the Creator. She was a twin of one of the other three Supreme Gods, Amaterasu.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>However, in some other myths and legends, there were also some which said that Tsukuyomi was male. There were also some which said that Tsukuyomi and the beautiful Kaguyahime were the same person.</p>
<p>None of that was important. What was important was that if this woman was really the legendary Tsukuyomi, her status would be second only to the Creator.</p>
<p>Myths could be exaggerated, but to have such a status in a pantheon, no matter how exaggerated, meant that her true strength had to be extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>Watching a movie with the daughter of the Creator? Zhou Wen felt that this was a bad idea.</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu and company waited on Fangzhang Island for a few days, but they didn’t see Zhou Wen return. The Ghost Parade that appeared every night also decreased significantly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the famous ghosts didn’t appear again. The ones that appeared again were ghosts with unknown names. The strongest ones were at the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>After the trio obtained further information, they became more certain that Zhou Wen was Human Sovereign. They imagined that the Calamity creature had been killed by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I never expected him to really be Human Sovereign. Furthermore, he’s so young.” Ji Moqing still found it unbelievable that Zhou Wen was Human Sovereign.</p>
<p>Fang Mingsu took Ji Moqing back inland and secretly investigated Zhou Wen’s identity.</p>
<p>He realized that Human Sovereign’s appearance was very similar to Zhou Wen from the An family camp. However, the An family’s Zhou Wen had been in Luoyang the past few days and hadn’t left. It was unlikely.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>After Shiraishi Satomi returned, she told Sei Gasakai that Zhou Wen was Human Sovereign. It thrilled Sei Gasakai. “It’s no wonder. He was Human Sovereign all along. It’s no wonder. I should have known. Apart from him, how can there be a human who can slash out such a strike… By the way… You should keep this to yourself… Don’t spread it…”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>To humans nowadays, watching movies was a luxury.</p>
<p>With dimensional creatures breaking through the restrictions on a large scale, there were very few cities that humans could defend. Most humans retreated to a particular dimensional zone and relied on the repulsive forces of the dimensional zones to barely survive.</p>
<p>All sorts of modern instruments and tools had been severely damaged. Furthermore, due to the cut-off of roads, raw materials couldn’t be supplied. Even if the factories weren’t destroyed, the possibility of continuing production wasn’t high.</p>
<p>In such an environment, other than the Federation occasionally shooting some promotional videos, it was very rare for a person to film a movie.</p>
<p>More and more research was done using Companion Beasts to replace high-tech equipment. Most of the areas where humans gathered had already been popularized with Companion Beast power generation systems.</p>
<p>However, human hobbies sometimes had nothing to do with practicality.</p>
<p>The infamous overseas devil, Sasser, was an avid movie enthusiast. Furthermore, he was someone who had to go to the cinema to watch movies.</p>
<p>However, in this era, cinemas were very difficult to find. There were none overseas. Therefore, every time Sasser’s movie addiction flared up, he would sneak inland.</p>
<p>Although Sasser wasn’t as infamous as Jing Daoxian, people who knew him definitely had a fear of him that was no less than Jing Daoxian’s.</p>
<p>Although Jing Daoxian was infamous, not many people had seen him kill.</p>
<p>Apart from the crazy massacre at the Federation building, many of the brutal legends regarding Jing Daoxian were actually just people committing acts under his name.</p>
<p>However, Sasser was different. Sasser wasn’t famous, but the number of people he killed far exceeded Jing Daoxian’s. Furthermore, he didn’t leave any survivors, so very few people knew of him.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>After putting on a decent suit, a white shirt, and a bow tie, Sasser, who had meticulously combed his white hair, arrived at the cinema’s entrance. He lined up to buy a ticket, coke, and a bucket of popcorn. Then, as though he was on a pilgrimage, he walked into the cinema’s theater hall.</p>
<p>These habits stemmed from when Sasser was young. Back then, when his parents took him to the movies, they would always dress him up nicely. Then, they would buy coke and popcorn and catch a movie together.</p>
<p>Therefore, this habit remained.</p>
<p>Sasser found his seat and sat down. He sat up straight and sized up the movie screen. Just as he had imagined, this spot was indeed the best spot in the theater. Thankfully, it hadn’t been bought by others. Otherwise, he would have spent more time thinking of a way to adjust his seat.</p>
<p>It was a rather nice cinema. The fragrant popcorn that was still emitting steam, the iced coke, and the perfect seat made Sasser feel good. He adjusted his bow tie and waited for the movie to begin.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a young man and woman walked in. The spot they had chosen happened to be in the row just in front of Sasser. This made Sasser frown slightly.</p>
<p>He recalled an unhappy experience he had when he watched a movie previously. A couple sat in front of him and whispered to each other from time to time. They even kissed in front of him, greatly affecting his movie experience.</p>
<p>As a result, Sasser sewed the couple’s mouths together and hung them to death at the entrance of the theater after the movie ended.</p>
<p>Why did he have to wait for the movie to end? Movie time was sacred, so how could he kill someone during the movie?</p>
<p>Thankfully, the young men and women who had just entered were very silent. They didn’t talk to each other, making Sasser feel much better.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, this should be a perfect movie experience today. Sasser sat up straight and waited for the movie to begin. Although this movie was an old movie and Sasser had watched it a few times, he still liked it. He wouldn’t get sick of watching it a few more times.</p>
<p>After a while, Sasser suddenly heard the young man in front speak.</p>
<p>“Do you want anything to eat or drink?”</p>
<p>When Sasser heard that, he was immediately infuriated as he thought to himself, What’s wrong with young people these days? They don’t understand the essence of watching movies at all. You have to buy iced coke and popcorn before entering. How can you buy them after entering the hall?</p>
<p>“Anything,” the woman said coldly.</p>
<p>“Wait for me here. Don’t move. I’ll be back soon.” As the youth spoke, he left, leaving the young woman sitting in front.</p>
<p>The young woman was very quiet, and she was still. This made Sasser appreciate her.</p>
<p>He still remembered that two months ago, when he went to watch a movie, a young woman was eating melon seeds while watching a movie. She kept fidgeting around. Hence, after the movie ended, Sasser shattered all the woman’s teeth and stuffed them into her stomach before hanging her to death at the entrance of the theater.</p>
<p>“Orange juice and melon seeds. Try them.” The man returned with two large cups of orange juice and a huge bag of melon seeds.</p>
<p>You have to drink coke and eat popcorn when watching a movie. Don’t you even know that? Sasser wished he could snatch the melon seeds and orange juice and smash them at the young man’s face.</p>
<p>However, years of movie-watching cultivation made Sasser endure it. However, he was already planning how to teach the young man some movie-watching etiquette after the movie ended.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1135'>Chapter 1135: Boring Movie</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Speaking of which, Zhou Wen felt wronged. If you were to ask him how to kill dimensional creatures or which dimensional zones had which taboo, he might know something about that.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen really didn’t know what taboos to look out for when watching movies at a cinema. His knowledge of movie theaters basically came from Li Xuan’s descriptions, so how could he know much?</p>
<p>​ </p>
<p>Li Xuan was only focused on showing off and bragging. He wouldn’t talk about the trivialities. He only talked about how he was popular with girls and how they threw themselves at him.</p>
<p>After passing the melon seeds and orange juice to Tsukuyomi, Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to eat snacks, so he sat there resting with his eyes closed. In fact, he was thinking about how to get rid of Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>Previously, after Tsukuyomi dispelled the Calamity domain, Zhou Wen had thought of escaping, but he ultimately gave up.</p>
<p>The main reason was that Tsukuyomi had spatial abilities. Now, Tsukuyomi had no intention of killing him. If he failed to escape and she caught him, it would probably be a situation of fighting to the death.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if Tsukuyomi really went berserk and the Ghost Parade erupted, too many innocent people would suffer.</p>
<p>If he could peacefully send Tsukuyomi away, Zhou Wen would be very happy to give it a try.</p>
<p>I heard from Sei Gasakai that most Calamity creatures leave Earth not long after they are born. A small portion of them vanished. No one saw where they went, but they basically never appeared on Earth again. They probably left Earth as well. Although I don’t know why Calamity creatures leave Earth, there must be some restrictions. I wonder if Tsukuyomi will be affected by this restriction? If she will be affected as well, I just need to wait until she has to leave before I call it a win, right? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>However, stalling for time was one thing. It was impossible to make Zhou Wen sacrifice himself—sexually.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was thinking about how to stall for time, Sasser, who was behind him, had a sullen expression and twitching eyes. He had the urge to murder.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know the etiquette of the cinema, much less Tsukuyomi, a dimensional creature. Although she had already transformed into a human and wore human clothes, she was still a dimensional creature.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was thinking while Tsukuyomi was munching on melon seeds. Although the munching sounds weren’t loud, it made Sasser feel uneasy.</p>
<p>“Young lady, you can’t eat melon seeds during a movie. This is basic etiquette.” Before the movie began, Sasser decided to remind them.</p>
<p>However, Tsukuyomi ignored him. This was because in Tsukuyomi’s eyes, other than Zhou Wen, no other humans mattered. They were lifeforms that were inferior to ants. There was no need to care about their feelings.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned his head to look at Sasser and saw that it was an old man with a head full of white hair. He apologized before saying to Tsukuyomi, “Don’t eat melon seeds when watching the movie later.”</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi nodded slightly before putting the melon seeds aside and stopping eating.</p>
<p>Seeing that their attitude wasn’t bad, Sasser’s mood improved slightly. Since the movie hasn’t started, I’ll spare you for now.</p>
<p>Soon, the movie began. It was an old movie called The Prestige.</p>
<p>In fact, in recent years, all the movies that were shown in theaters were basically old movies. It wasn’t just because of nostalgia, but mainly because there were very few new movies being filmed.</p>
<p>Sasser knew all the details of The Prestige like the back of his hand, but he was still very engrossed every time he watched it.</p>
<p>The movie began. That’s when Sasser picked up his coke and popcorn and enjoyed the classic that delighted him.</p>
<p>However, not long after, he suddenly saw Tsukuyomi in front of him stand up and say to Zhou Wen, “Watching boring movies here is a waste of time. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>With that said, Tsukuyomi turned around and walked towards the exit.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted when he heard that. He stood up and followed Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>A creature at Tsukuyomi’s level had almost infinite life. By saying that it was a waste of time, it was very likely because of some restriction she was under. Time had an extraordinary meaning to her.</p>
<p>This made Zhou Wen feel that his previous guess was right. Tsukuyomi had no choice but to leave Earth after a certain period of time. This was very beneficial for him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted, but Sasser was about to explode from anger.</p>
<p>Boring movie… A waste of time… Sasser’s gaze became abnormally terrifying. It’s already unforgivable to leave early in front of such a great movie, yet you still dare…</p>
<p>Sasser slowly stood up. Having watched movies for so many years, this was one of the few times he had left early.</p>
<p>“You don’t like this movie? We can switch to another one,” Zhou Wen said as he walked alongside Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>“I don’t like such boring movies,” Tsukuyomi said.</p>
<p>“Then what do you like?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi lowered her head and thought for a moment. After a while, she said, “I don’t know. Anyway, I don’t like watching movies.”</p>
<p>As the two of them spoke, they had already reached the entrance of the theater.</p>
<p>Sasser followed. Upon hearing Tsukuyomi’s words, the killing intent in his heart burned even more. Standing on the steps, his body produced a faint energy fluctuation.</p>
<p>You actually dare belittle a movie? Then I’ll let you have a taste of being killed by a movie. Sasser’s eyes were cold as his strength secretly condensed into a camera in his hand. He pressed the shutter button as the camera aimed at Tsukuyomi and Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>In the next second, Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi, who had just walked down the steps of the cinema, suddenly realized that their surroundings had changed drastically.</p>
<p>The streets had vanished, and the entire city seemed to suddenly vanish. It was supposed to be nighttime, but the sun was shining brightly here. In front of them was a blue sea, blue sky, and a beautiful huge ship.</p>
<p>Blue sea, blue sky, seagulls flying.</p>
<p>The two of them were standing on the cruise ship. A breeze blew past them, making them feel very comfortable.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised as he circulated his Essence Energy Art, but he realized that he couldn’t use it.</p>
<p>Not only was he unable to use Essence Energy Arts, but he couldn’t even summon Companion Beasts. He seemed to have become an ordinary person.</p>
<p>“Can you use your strength?” Zhou Wen asked Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi shook her head slightly and said, “No.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression changed slightly. If even Tsukuyomi couldn’t use her powers, things had likely turned very troublesome.</p>
<p>Could it be that the monarchs of the dimension discovered that I wasn’t dead and wanted to kill me across dimensions? Otherwise, who would have the ability to trap Tsukuyomi? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he constantly switched Essence Energy Arts, hoping that something would be of use.</p>
<p>Soon, when Zhou Wen circulated the Dao Sutra, the Essence Energy that hadn’t reacted finally reacted. But it still couldn’t circulate.</p>
<p>However, this already delighted Zhou Wen. At critical moments, I still need to rely on the Dao Sutra. From the looks of it, we have been pulled into a domain limited by certain rules. If the Dao Sutra advances further, I might be able to break through. I wonder if my opponent will give me the time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked around. He didn’t have the ability to resist now. It was too easy for the enemy to kill him. However, all he could see were ordinary humans.</p>
<p>No, it shouldn’t be said that they were ordinary humans. The humans here were much weaker than ordinary humans. They seemed to be humans who had never cultivated.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1136'>Chapter 1136: Sea Disaster</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was looking around, he suddenly felt a violent quake beneath his feet. Then, he heard a loud crashing sound before an ear-piercing screech.</p>
<p>​ </p>
<p>Before he could figure out what had happened, the ship’s massive body began to tilt to the side. At the same time, there was a muffled explosion.</p>
<p>An iceberg appeared out of nowhere, slamming into the deck. The shattered ice struck people, leaving many bleeding.</p>
<p>Cries and screams intertwined as the ship’s side tipped even more. Many people slid and fell. An explosion happened somewhere nearby as a heatwave surged over, sending Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi flying.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no idea where in hell he was. Not only was he unable to use Essence Energy Skills and various other abilities, but even his body had become extremely weak as though he had never cultivated.</p>
<p>Thankfully, although his strength and abilities were unusable, his technique and reaction remained. When Zhou Wen tumbled down, he grabbed the railing and prevented himself from falling into the sea.</p>
<p>Previously, Zhou Wen had doubted if Tsukuyomi could use her powers, but he quickly realized that she couldn’t. She grabbed a metal column that was taller than Zhou Wen, but the cabin beside her suddenly exploded. The fragments smashed into Tsukuyomi’s head, immediately causing her to bleed. She seemed to show signs of fainting as she fell and rolled down the deck, about to fall into the sea.</p>
<p>The temperature of the seawater was already below zero degrees Celsius. In the past, Zhou Wen could shower in such low temperatures, but now, his body was like an ordinary person’s. If he fell, it wouldn’t be long before all the heat in his body was sucked away by the seawater. When that happened, only death awaited him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen subconsciously reached out to grab the half-conscious Tsukuyomi and pulled her over.</p>
<p>Although this was a good opportunity to kill Tsukuyomi, Zhou Wen felt that it was likely that the dimensional monarchs were targeting him. Tsukuyomi was suffering an undeserved catastrophe.</p>
<p>The enemy of an enemy was a friend. Perhaps saving Tsukuyomi today would give the dimension another Calamity-grade enemy in the future.</p>
<p>After all, Tsukuyomi was a natural Calamity creature born on Earth. It was somewhat different from the monarchs of the dimension.</p>
<p>“How are you?” Zhou Wen realized that the wound on Tsukuyomi’s forehead was very deep. It was a result of a few metal fragments stabbing into her and she was constantly bleeding. From the looks of it, the situation wasn’t good.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi opened her mouth but didn’t make a sound. Her eyes had already lost their focus and she was on the brink of unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and pulled Tsukuyomi along the deck, hoping to find something that could be used as a lifeboat, even if it was just a floating plank.</p>
<p>Once the ship sank, ordinary humans wouldn’t be able to last long in the icy-water sludge. They had to leave the sea to have a chance of survival.</p>
<p>However, there were people running for their lives everywhere. Some people jumped into the sea disregarding anything, hoping to leave the ship as soon as possible to prevent themselves from being pulled into the sea by the suction force produced when the ship sank. From Zhou Wen’s point of view, it was no different from having a death wish.</p>
<p>Some people also found lifeboats before jumping into the sea and then using these tools to escape.</p>
<p>However, there were too many people who were escaping. In order to survive, many people tried their best to climb into the lifeboats near them. This resulted in overcapacity—the lifeboats capsized and everyone fell into the sea.</p>
<p>There were also a few crew members organizing the children and women to board the lifeboats. Zhou Wen looked around and didn’t find anything that could be used as a boat.</p>
<p>The nearby hatch doors were all metal and couldn’t be used as rafts.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only carry Tsukuyomi and constantly run for the high ground, constantly searching, hoping to find something that could save himself.</p>
<p>After losing his strength, Zhou Wen realized that the strength of humans was pathetic. Just running for a while with Tsukuyomi in his arms made his heart beat vigorously. His limbs ached and he was out of breath.</p>
<p>Dao Sutra kept circulating intermittently. Zhou Wen also kept trying his best to engrave the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder on the Wheel of Destiny, but due to the strange power here, the difficulty of engraving it was too great. The shallow marks on the Wheel of Destiny quickly vanished, preventing him from engraving the complete Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder.</p>
<p>Just as he was climbing up, a black shadow suddenly smashed down from above. Zhou Wen dodged to the side and the thing smashed into the metal pillar beside him. Only then did Zhou Wen realize that it was a table.</p>
<p>I’ve got it! Zhou Wen was overjoyed. Seeing that the table was about to continue sliding down, he hurriedly rushed over and kicked it towards the surface of the sea.</p>
<p>After the table fell, Zhou Wen jumped down after it and fell into the sea with Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi’s face was covered in blood and she was unconscious. As the seawater met her face, the blood all over her face was washed away, dyeing the nearby seawater red.</p>
<p>The bone-chilling seawater made Zhou Wen shiver as he hurriedly pulled the unconscious Tsukuyomi onto the floating table.</p>
<p>However, the table’s buoyancy couldn’t withstand their weight and sank a little. Zhou Wen’s calves were soaked in the seawater as he felt his body’s heat rapidly wick away.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the waves would hit them from time to time, making them shiver from the cold.</p>
<p>A lifeboat happened to row by at that moment. On it were a few women and children. They watched Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi as they rowed.</p>
<p>“Our boat allows for one more person…” a woman shouted at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the unconscious Tsukuyomi in his arms and gritted his teeth before handing her over.</p>
<p>The women pulled Tsukuyomi onto the lifeboat. The lifeboat’s waterline was almost at its limit, so it was impossible for Zhou Wen to board it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen waved his hand at them, gesturing for them to leave.</p>
<p>Without Tsukuyomi’s weight, the table’s surface rose significantly, but it was still covered in the seawater. A portion of Zhou Wen’s calf remained soaked in the seawater, numbing it until it showed a purplish-black color.</p>
<p>At that moment, he couldn’t care less. As he paddled, he tried his best to get the top of the table surface out of the water. At the same time, he constantly engraved the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and infused his insights from his hundred years of imprisonment into it.</p>
<p>Without the augmentation of Essence Energy, it was difficult to leave deep marks on the Wheel of Destiny with just his thoughts. However, with Zhou Wen’s thoughts changing, even without the augmentation of Essence Energy, the marks became deeper and deeper. Soon, Zhou Wen finally succeeded in carving out the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder.</p>
<p>At the instant the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder appeared, Zhou Wen felt his Essence Energy surge out like a spring. It instantly nourished his body and restored his original strength. The cold seawater was no longer able to affect his body.</p>
<p>How did this happen? Sasser kept watching the scene on the camera. When he saw that Zhou Wen could actually use Essence Energy in the movie world, his expression turned nasty.</p>
<p>Although his Life Soul was magical, it could only send people into the movie world. He was unable to control the plot in the movie. All he could do was watch Zhou Wen recover his strength.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Suddenly, Sasser felt a mysterious force flow into his Life Soul, causing the movie world in the camera to change.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1137'>Chapter 1137: Tripartite Struggle</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Sasser wore a look of horror. He realized that he couldn’t control his Life Soul. The movie world that shouldn’t have been changed had undergone a tremendous change.</p>
<p>Why is this happening? Who’s controlling my Life Soul… Impossible… Sasser looked around, but he found nothing.</p>
<p>​ </p>
<p>He became more alarmed. He couldn’t find the other party, but they had controlled his Life Soul. This was a terrifying thought.</p>
<p>Sasser desperately wanted to retract his Life Soul and dispel the movie world, but it was already too late. The camera-like Life Soul seemed to have its own consciousness as it crazily absorbed Sasser’s Essence Energy. In just a moment, his face was as pale as snow. His cheeks clearly thinned.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had just recovered his Essence Energy when he suddenly saw a huge storm of dark clouds in the sky. The storm poured down as lightning constantly flashed and rumbled in the sky.</p>
<p>The strong winds blew at the seawater, forming huge waves that came crashing over.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder that Zhou Wen had just condensed shattered once again.</p>
<p>What a powerful taboo power. Even the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder can’t withstand it. Are the monarchs of the dimension bent on killing me? Zhou Wen was once again relegated to an ordinary person.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Amidst the storm, Zhou Wen was thrown into the seawater by a huge wave. He kept tumbling in the bone-chilling seawater. After managing to finally surface, he found his body was almost frozen.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Another huge wave smashed over as something slammed into Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen hugged the thing and tumbled out of the sea. It felt like a person.</p>
<p>After he stabilized himself and rushed out of the water with the person, he realized that it was Tsukuyomi who had slammed into him.</p>
<p>Not far away, there were women and children who had fallen into the water. They couldn’t escape in such a storm even if there were lifeboats. They were instantly swept deep into the sea.</p>
<p>Many people could have lived, but now, it was unlikely any of them could.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hugged Tsukuyomi and felt that her body no longer had any warmth. She was probably close to death; this only served to make him extremely depressed.</p>
<p>He wasn’t sad that Tsukuyomi was dying, but even the lives of Calamity-grade creatures were in the hands of the dimensional monarchs. As for him, he was also at their mercy. Seeing so many humans die like ants filled Zhou Wen’s chest with anger and indignation, making him feel like his chest was about to explode.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen knew very well that no matter how angry he was, it was useless. The world wouldn’t change because of a human’s anger, nor would it change the rules because of human emotions.</p>
<p>The only thing he could do was turn his anger into motivation and work hard to understand the rules and make use of them until he became the person who decided on the rules.</p>
<p>Under the bombardment of the massive waves, even the huge cruise ship sank, not to mention humans. The sunken ship soon became the center of a huge whirlpool.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hugged Tsukuyomi, whose fate was unknown, and was swept into the sea. His body constantly slammed into objects that were swept down by the seawater, but his frozen body didn’t feel any pain.</p>
<p>Sasser was about to become a dry corpse. Although he had advanced to the Terror grade after fusing with a Guardian, the power of the Terror grade still couldn’t withstand such terrifying suction.</p>
<p>Who is the one behind this… Who is it… Unforgivable… Absolutely unforgivable… Sasser’s eyes were red as they emitted a ruthless red glow.</p>
<p>He wasn’t angry because he had been used by others, or even because he might die.</p>
<p>The reason he was angry was because the original movie world had been wrecked to an unbearable extent.</p>
<p>Although he used the movie world to kill people, he never destroyed the ending as expected of the movie world.</p>
<p>However, under the influence of that terrifying power, the male and female protagonists in the movie world had been completely wiped out, causing a touching movie to lose its meaning of existence.</p>
<p>Unforgivable… Unforgivable… The last bit of strength in Sasser’s body completely erupted. The camera in his hand was emitting smoke everywhere as sparks constantly shot out, as though it had missed a spark.</p>
<p>Everything that happened inside the camera’s movie world began rewinding. It was as though he had pressed the rewind button while watching a movie.</p>
<p>Sasser wanted to restore this destroyed movie world. He definitely couldn’t tolerate the destruction of this movie he deemed a classic—even if it meant risking his life.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, who was constantly deducing the Dao Sutra, suddenly felt time and space around him strangely retreat. Even the Life Mark he had engraved had vanished.</p>
<p>Rules… Rules… Only by understanding all the rules can I use them… Zhou Wen forced himself to calm down in the chaotic space. He engraved the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder again and again, correcting his understanding of the rules.</p>
<p>Many people believed that freedom without rules and restrictions was true freedom, but Zhou Wen believed that without rules and restrictions, there was no freedom.</p>
<p>Only by understanding the rules and grasping them could one truly obtain freedom.</p>
<p>Being lawless wasn’t called freedom. It would only lead to destruction. That wasn’t what Zhou Wen needed.</p>
<p>Pfft!</p>
<p>Blood spewed out of Sasser’s mouth as he looked like a ferocious ghost. The terrifying force drove the movie world, allowing the movie plot to continue progressing.</p>
<p>Sasser had tried his best, but he still couldn’t stop it.</p>
<p>F*ck you. Get back here. The blood vessels in Sasser’s body burst, and blood flowed from his seven orifices. His blood burned, and the movie rewound again.</p>
<p>However, the force increased again, allowing the plot to continue moving forward.</p>
<p>Sasser completely disregarded his life as he unleashed his vital potential again and again, forcefully rewinding the movie.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>After all, this was Sasser’s Life Soul. Although the force was extremely terrifying and even stronger than Sasser, under Sasser’s desperate efforts, they were in a stalemate. It alternated between fast-forwarding and rewinding. The entire movie world’s timeline constantly changed.</p>
<p>In the chaos of time and space, the marks on Zhou Wen’s Wheel of Destiny deepened. Be it the effects of rewinding or fast-forwarding, they had little influence on the mark.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen finally engraved the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder again, but this time, it wasn’t over. Zhou Wen carved a Life Mark on the activated Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. The Life Mark transformed into scriptures that constantly appeared in the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. It was Zhou Wen’s comprehension of the rules.</p>
<p>With the appearance of the scripture, the light from the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder intensified. The influence the movie world had on Zhou Wen decreased, and it was even affected by the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>A strange light bloomed in the movie world.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1138'>Chapter 1138: So This Is Free Love</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>In the chaotic movie world, the tempest raged on. Dark clouds blotted out the sky as lightning streaked across the sky as waves devoured everything in their path.</p>
<p>However, a human emitted a holy glow as he slowly surfaced from the sea. It was none other than Zhou Wen who had fallen into the sea.</p>
<p>​ </p>
<p>He held Tsukuyomi in one hand and held a mysterious ancient scripture in the other. The words on the ancient scripture emitted a mysterious glow.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was in the movie world, but the power in the movie world could no longer affect him.</p>
<p>However, this wasn’t the outcome Zhou Wen wanted. He looked at the ancient scripture in his hand as the sutra’s glow intensified, illuminating the entire space.</p>
<p>The dark clouds dispersed as the wind and rain came to a stop. In the mysterious holy light, the humans who had been swept into the sea appeared again as though on rewind. Finally, the huge cruise ship slowly floated up from the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>The entire timeline in the movie world was rewinding. The mysterious power that had resisted Sasser suddenly vanished, leaving only Sasser’s power and the power of the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder at odds with each other.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Sasser wanted to rewind time and turn the plot back to normal.</p>
<p>But now, not only had time rewound to normal, but it was also constantly rewinding. It was almost back at the movie’s beginning.</p>
<p>Sasser wanted to stop it, but he realized that his strength was no longer able to resist the power to rewind time. Despite exerting his full strength, the movie rewound to the beginning. The camera’s screen was covered in snowflakes.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The camera that was already producing sparks finally exploded. As the camera exploded, Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi, who were in the movie world, appeared out of thin air.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time as the camera exploded, Sasser spat out a mouthful of blood. His body, which was almost unrecognizable, forcefully transformed into a stream of light and escaped into the movie theater’s large screen that was playing a trailer. Then, he vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood on the steps in front of the theater with Tsukuyomi in his arms. The commotion had attracted the attention of many passers-by. At that moment, everyone was staring at Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi, who was being princess-carried by Zhou Wen, slowly opened her eyes as her injuries rapidly healed.</p>
<p>Her expression was gentle as her eyes appeared misted. She looked at Zhou Wen and said shyly, “You saved me. From now on, I’m yours.”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>With that said, Tsukuyomi closed her eyes. A charming blush rose on her beautiful face, inevitably making one have evil thoughts.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Although they didn’t know what had happened, everyone around them began clapping when they heard Tsukuyomi’s confession. Some even shouted, “Kiss her!”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Tsukuyomi and suddenly threw her to the ground.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>This action stunned everyone. Tsukuyomi reacted very quickly. Just as she was about to fall to the ground, she blinked and was already standing up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen left without looking back. Tsukuyomi hurriedly chased after him.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, this brother is too awesome. Such a beauty delivered a public confession, but he threw her down without a word. After that, the beauty even chased after him. Why do I never encounter such a good thing?”</p>
<p>“The heavens are truly blind. Why didn’t that beauty take a fancy to me?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Why?” Tsukuyomi chased after him and asked.</p>
<p>“Why? I should be asking you. Do you think I’m a fool? You were the one controlling the movie space, right?” Zhou Wen glared at her.</p>
<p>Previously, Zhou Wen had believed that the dimensional monarchs were attacking him, so he didn’t suspect Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>However, after shattering the movie world, he realized that the other party was likely at the Terror grade—definitely not the monarchs from the dimension. Otherwise, even if the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder had Terror transformed, it would be impossible for him to shatter the movie world so easily.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen refused to believe that a Terror form Life Soul was able to nearly kill Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi’s eyes narrowed into crescents as she said with a smile, “Didn’t you say that free love requires romance? A hero saving a beauty. Isn’t it romantic enough for a beauty to marry him in return?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat speechless as he looked at Tsukuyomi. He was momentarily at a loss for words. All he could do was shake his head and continue walking forward.</p>
<p>“Is that wrong? I think that’s what you humans say in your stories. I’m certain of it.” Tsukuyomi took out her phone and opened the Qidian app. She read it again and felt that she hadn’t done anything wrong.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>“Tell me what I did wrong. I’ll change,” Tsukuyomi followed and asked in all seriousness.</p>
<p>“Please act more realistically next time. Do it in a way that I can’t tell, alright?” Zhou Wen wasn’t able to put across his point clearly, so he gave a patronizing answer.</p>
<p>“So that’s how it is. To deceive the other party without the other party seeing through it. Is this what it means by free love?” Tsukuyomi nodded thoughtfully as though she had gained some insight.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was rendered speechless when he heard that. He decided to stop telling Tsukuyomi about such pointless matters in the future. It was best not to say anything.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen could tell that Tsukuyomi had no intention of killing him. Furthermore, she seemed to have a request for him.</p>
<p>What do I have that Tsukuyomi wants? Could it be that Heavenly Happiness Token? However, Dragon Girl previously told me that the Heavenly Happiness Token can allow one to escape the restrictions of dimensional zones. Tsukuyomi has long escaped the restrictions of dimensional zones, why would she want the Heavenly Happiness Token? Could it be that it’s not the Heavenly Happiness Token? Zhou Wen thought for a moment but apart from the Heavenly Happiness Token, there didn’t seem to be anything that was worth Tsukuyomi’s efforts.</p>
<p>If she wanted the Immortal Culling Sword or something else, she could just snatch it from him. There was no need for her to marry him. After some thought, only the Heavenly Happiness Token needed Tsukuyomi to do these things because the Heavenly Happiness Token was something useless even if she snatched it.</p>
<p>What’s the Heavenly Happiness Token that Emperor of Shang gave me? Zhou Wen really wanted to go to the dimension to ask Emperor of Shang, but unfortunately, the only path he knew was in Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>The Thearch of Chess Mountain was probably even more difficult to deal with than Tsukuyomi. Zhou Wen didn’t wish to provoke her.</p>
<p>How long can this Tsukuyomi stay on Earth? Zhou Wen secretly paid attention to Tsukuyomi and realized that she was browsing the Internet with her phone—one that Zhou Wen had bought for her.</p>
<p>However, from Tsukuyomi’s relaxed look, it seemed like she wasn’t in a rush to leave.</p>
<p>Could I be wrong? Not all Calamity-grade creatures need to leave Earth? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>Since he couldn’t escape, Zhou Wen could only get used to it.</p>
<p>With Tsukuyomi on the phone the entire time, he took out his phone and prepared to try the Bloodline function he had activated.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy and Demonic Neonate constitute my main combat strength. I can try to add some useful Life Providences for them. If Doctor Darkness and Explosive Fiend Man have some more powerful Life Providences, they can become stronger. Perhaps they might have a chance to advance further. I wonder if there are any Life Providences that can resolve Truth Listener’s problem. Zhou Wen browsed through all the Companion Beasts he had. He didn’t worry about which stage they were in, only looking at their Life Providences. As long as their Life Providences were good enough, it didn’t matter if their levels were low.</p>
<p>After browsing for a while, Zhou Wen discovered many low-leveled Companion Beasts who had very unique Life Providences. They could be said to be fantastic.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1139'>Chapter 1139: Gone Viral</h3>
<p>The Ancient Splitting Tadpole’s Split Life Providence was an extremely powerful Life Providence. It split into an individual that was comparable to its own strength. Many Companion Beasts’ strength would increase drastically after possessing this Life Providence.</p>
<p>However, the Ancient Splitting Tadpole was too rare. Zhou Wen only had one drop to date. The success rate of the Bloodline function was too low, so it was almost impossible to get another Companion Beast to gain the Split Life Providence with one Ancient Splitting Tadpole.</p>
<p>However, although the Epic Dark Gold Tadpoles were much weaker than the Ancient Splitting Tadpole, they had the same Life Providence as the Ancient Splitting Tadpole—Split.</p>
<p>He couldn’t bear to use the Ancient Splitting Tadpole, but he had no qualms regarding the Dark Gold Tadpoles.</p>
<p>It’s time to showcase my true skills. Zhou Wen carefully counted and looked at how many Dark Gold Tadpoles he had. He realized that there were more than three hundred of them.</p>
<p>In the past, Zhou Wen had farmed the dungeon many times, hoping to obtain another Ancient Splitting Tadpole, but he had failed to obtain one.</p>
<p>However, he did manage to farm many Epic Dark Gold Tadpoles as a result. He originally thought that they were useless, but they came in handy now.</p>
<p>Who should I test it on first? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that he shouldn’t test it on Banana Fairy and Demonic Neonate immediately. If there were any flaws with the Bloodline function, it wouldn’t be worth it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and summoned the Bronze Sparrow Sword. He planned on using the Bronze Sparrow Sword to see if the Bloodline function could really allow it to have two Life Providences without any negatives.</p>
<p>He placed the Bronze Sparrow Sword as the primary pet and chose a Dark Gold Tadpole as the bloodline sacrifice.</p>
<p>After clicking on begin, there was a flash on the phone screen. The Dark Gold Tadpole vanished while the Bronze Sparrow Sword remained.</p>
<p>Failure is the mother of success. Let’s do it again. Zhou Wen had plenty of Dark Gold Tadpoles on hand, so he didn’t care about one or two.</p>
<p>He placed another Dark Gold Tadpole in and chose Bloodline transfer again, but it still failed.</p>
<p>I have plenty of Companion Beasts. Again. Zhou Wen was already mentally prepared and knew that it wouldn’t be easy to succeed.</p>
<p>Therefore, he placed the Dark Gold Tadpole in again and again, but he failed even after ten attempts.</p>
<p>Failure is a necessary path to success. As long as the bricks are paved well, there’s no path that can’t be crossed. If ten bricks aren’t enough, I’ll lay another ten. Zhou Wen continued tapping away.</p>
<p>Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!</p>
<p>However, he still failed repeatedly. He sacrificed thirty ancient tadpoles without success.</p>
<p>Is the success rate of Bloodline transfer so low? Zhou Wen’s heart raced.</p>
<p>He wanted to give up, but he couldn’t bear to do so. If he gave up now, wouldn’t the thirty Dark Gold Tadpoles have been thrown away for nothing?</p>
<p>If thirty won’t do, I’ll do another thirty. I don’t believe that I can’t even have one success. Zhou Wen sacrificed another thirty, but he still failed.</p>
<p>I don’t believe it. Even if the success rate is only 1%, I should be able to succeed after sacrificing another thirty to forty of them, right? Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and sacrificed another forty.</p>
<p>The idea was nice, but reality was cruel. A hundred Dark Gold Tadpoles were sacrificed, but none of them succeeded.</p>
<p>Could the success rate really be that low? It’s not even 1%? It can’t be 0.1%, right? Zhou Wen began having second thoughts.</p>
<p>If there was really a 0.1% chance of success, then his 300 Dark Gold Tadpoles might not be able to create a dual Life Providence.</p>
<p>This wasn’t about experimenting anymore. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that it wasn’t a solution.</p>
<p>Without continuing to use Bloodline transfer, Zhou Wen first went to the bathroom to remove the filth in his body. Then, he washed his hands and cleaned himself up. He then bowed in all directions raising both hands before taking out his phone again and placing a Companion Beast on it.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen didn’t use the Bronze Sparrow Sword. Although the Bronze Sparrow Sword was very powerful, Zhou Wen didn’t lack weapons. Without knowing if he could succeed, Zhou Wen felt that it was better to bet on Explosive Fiend Man.</p>
<p>Placing the Dark Gold Tadpole in still resulted in repeated failures. This situation was already within Zhou Wen’s expectations. Now, he didn’t wish for high success rates. He just wanted one success out of the remaining 200 plus Dark Gold Tadpoles.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt like he was releasing firecrackers. With a bang, they were reduced to ashes.</p>
<p>As this went on over and over again, there was a festive atmosphere. Yet, he didn’t even succeed once.</p>
<p>Coupled with the hundred failures from before, the three hundred plus Dark Gold Tadpoles quickly vanished. There were less than fifty left with not one iota of hope left to be seen.</p>
<p>It can’t be… Although Zhou Wen didn’t mind failure, he still felt somewhat depressed. At the same time, he felt that the Bloodline function was just useless. With such a low success rate, unless it involved Companion Beasts that appeared en masse like music sprites, it would be very, very difficult to succeed.</p>
<p>The last thirty did not succeed.</p>
<p>The last twenty did not succeed.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen continued putting Companion Beasts in dejectedly and was about to use the Bloodline transfer function again, Tsukuyomi, who was playing on her phone, put it down and walked over to Zhou Wen. As she walked, she asked, “What are you playing? It looks fun?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly put down his phone and looked at Tsukuyomi. “It’s a mobile game. Do you want to play?”</p>
<p>“How do you play mobile games?” Tsukuyomi asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Give me your phone. After I download it for you, you can use your phone to play.” Zhou Wen placed the mysterious phone in his pocket and took Tsukuyomi’s phone. Then, he logged on to the website to download the game, Dimension, that Huang Ji had created.</p>
<p>However, when he searched for the game, Dimension, Zhou Wen was somewhat dumbfounded. He realized that the game, Dimension, was already first on the mobile game rankings. Furthermore, the number of downloads far exceeded second place. The difference was huge. The number of downloads for second place was just a rounding error for Dimension.</p>
<p>Is it the same game? Zhou Wen was somewhat suspicious. Perhaps this Dimension only had the same name as the game that Huang Ji had created.</p>
<p>However, on careful look, the icon for Dimension was still the same. There were no changes at all.</p>
<p>Could it really be the same game? Has Huang Ji’s Dimension really gone viral? Zhou Wen attempted to download it.The current app was clearly much bigger than before. Thankfully, the Internet speed here was rather impressive. It took him nearly half an hour to download the game.</p>
<p>After entering the game, Zhou Wen still couldn’t be sure if this was a game produced by Huang Ji. Be it the graphics or controls, it was much better than the previous version of Dimension. They were on completely different levels.</p>
<p>However, the most basic modes were still the same as Dimension.</p>
<p>Only when Zhou Wen went on Dimension’s official website and saw that the overall game designer’s name was Huang Ji, did he confirm that this Dimension was indeed the former Dimension mobile game.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1140'>Chapter 1140: Successful Division</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>After a brief search online, Zhou Wen realized that the popularity of Dimension far exceeded his imagination.</p>
<p>There were many humans playing Dimension. The current game dungeons were no longer limited to the few dungeons in Luoyang. Many dungeons from around the world were available.</p>
<p>​ </p>
<p>Of course, most of them were dungeons that humans had explored, but the assortment was rather complete.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen chose a few dungeons that he was more familiar with and entered the game to take a look. He realized that it was rather realistic. The various habits and actions of dimensional creatures had been done very realistically.</p>
<p>After familiarizing himself with the attack patterns of dimensional creatures in-game, it would definitely be of great help in real life.</p>
<p>For example, the Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior in the Metalwork Temple dungeon—the signs prior to it using its runes were very realistic.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was very surprised. He never expected that the mobile game he had randomly aided in its creation would be so popular in the world. Furthermore, it seemed to have become a dimensional zone database for everyone. This was something Zhou Wen had never expected.</p>
<p>Dimension had similar functions as Zhou Wen’s phone, but it didn’t have the mind connection function. It could only play dungeons that humans had already explored.</p>
<p>As for the mysterious phone, it could download dungeons that had never been entered. There was still a fundamental difference.</p>
<p>“Using mobile games to familiarize yourself with dimensional zones and dimensional creatures. You humans sure have some ideas.” Tsukuyomi was smart. After watching Zhou Wen play for a while, she knew what the game was about.</p>
<p>“Alright, you can play by yourself.” Zhou Wen returned the phone to Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>Seemingly intrigued, Tsukuyomi took her phone and started playing.</p>
<p>Seeing that Tsukuyomi was gaming, Zhou Wen took out the mysterious phone again. When he turned on the screen, he was immediately given a fright.</p>
<p>Previously, because of Tsukuyomi, Zhou Wen, who was choosing a pet, had put away his phone. Perhaps his fingers had touched a Companion Beast when he put it away, allowing him to place Torch Dragon on it.</p>
<p>On careful look, he realized that it had already undergone Bloodline transfer. What surprised Zhou Wen even more was that he had succeeded. Beside him was a notification that Bloodline transfer had succeeded.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at Torch Dragon’s information. Indeed, in the Life Providence column, there was not only the Life Providence, Son of a World King, but also Split.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me? It succeeded? Zhou Wen threw the remaining dozen or so Dark Gold Tadpoles at Explosive Fiend Man, but none of them succeeded.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me the Bloodline transfer function completely depends on luck? Zhou Wen really couldn’t tell if there was any pattern. Why did Torch Dragon succeed in one try?</p>
<p>He didn’t have the luxury of time to think much about it. Zhou Wen summoned Torch Dragon in-game to see what changes it would undergo after having the Split Life Providence.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me it can split into tiny Torch Dragons like the Splitting Tadpoles that can explode after death? Zhou Wen couldn’t imagine what it would be like.</p>
<p>To verify Torch Dragon’s new Life Providence, Zhou Wen took Torch Dragon to the snow valley behind the Valley of No Return.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been to Snow Valley many times in the past, but the blood-colored avatar died without knowing why. He didn’t even know the cause of death.</p>
<p>He had long suspected that there were Terror creatures there. Now was the time to take a look. He could also farm some Dark Gold Tadpoles.</p>
<p>He farmed all the way to Snow Valley. All he saw was silver snow. Apart from that, there were no other creatures in Snow Valley.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was no longer the same as before. With the Wheel of Destiny activated, the valley in his eyes immediately changed.</p>
<p>The originally beautiful Snow Valley became extremely terrifying in Zhou Wen’s eyes.</p>
<p>In the snow that looked extremely pure, there were countless tiny worms crawling around. They were densely packed and uncountable.</p>
<p>The worms looked like maggots, but they were even smaller. They drilled through the gaps in the snow, preventing any changes in the snow.</p>
<p>When he saw the countless tiny maggots squirming in the snow, Zhou Wen had the urge to vomit.</p>
<p>However, another thought suppressed the urge to vomit.</p>
<p>Although these worms are very small, they aren’t so small that I can’t see them. I couldn’t see them at all previously. Could it be that these worms are at the Terror grade? Zhou Wen was shocked by this thought.</p>
<p>There were countless worms in Snow Valley. The idea that they were all Terror creatures was terrifying.</p>
<p>If the worms here were to fly out, they would probably be able to destroy the entire world.</p>
<p>It’s impossible that they are all Terror creatures, right? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and ordered Torch Dragon to rush into Snow Valley. At the same time, he got it to activate the Bright Torch Vision World to see if it could kill the tiny worms in the snow.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World opened as its mirror-like eyes looked towards Snow Valley. The thick snow in Snow Valley immediately vanished.</p>
<p>However, the worms didn’t disappear with the snow. They remained where they were and landed on the ground below.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the Bright Torch Vision World was ineffective against them. The Mythical Torch Dragon Youngling couldn’t see them either, indicating that they might really be Terror-grade creatures.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon’s actions infuriated the tiny worms. On their white bodies, pairs of invisible wings unfurled.</p>
<p>Then, countless tiny worms flapped their wings and flew towards Torch Dragon like a fog.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon couldn’t see the tiny worms, so it had no idea that danger was approaching. It continued standing there in a daze.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly ordered it to attack, but it was useless. It couldn’t see the worms, so its strongest offensive skill, Bright Torch Vision World, was useless.</p>
<p>Countless tiny worms pounced on Torch Dragon and drilled into its body through any possible gaps.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen finally knew how the blood-colored avatar had died in the past. Just the thought of countless worms entering his mouth and nose made Zhou Wen feel uncomfortable. His throat felt itchy as he couldn’t help but swallow his saliva.</p>
<p>With the countless worms entering Torch Dragon’s body and about to kill it, Zhou Wen ordered it to use World King Transformation.</p>
<p>Numerous Torch Dragon Eyes opened on Torch Dragon’s body. Its aura immediately became terrifyingly powerful. Despite so many Torch Dragon Eyes using Bright Torch Vision World together, they still failed to injure the tiny worms.</p>
<p>Instead, Torch Dragon let out a painful roar. Its body had almost been bitten through by the worms.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Torch Dragon’s body split apart, but its body didn’t shatter into pieces. The rows of Torch Dragon Eyes that appeared on its body after the World King Transformation split apart. Every Torch Dragon Eye transformed into a miniature Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>Instantly, the huge Torch Dragon Youngling turned into a bunch of tiny Torch Dragon Younglings with one eye.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the tiny Explosive Dragon Youngling in a daze. This was clearly different from the Ancient Splitting Tadpole’s Split.</p>
<p>The Ancient Splitting Tadpole’s Split was a passive skill. It could only split after an explosion. As for Torch Dragon Youngling’s Split, it seemed to split on its own accord, splitting its body into smaller Torch Dragons. The smaller Torch Dragons were clearly not bombs, and they had no intention of self-destructing.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1141'>Chapter 1141: The Way for Continued Growth</h3>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was feeling alarmed, he realized that Torch Dragon had unleashed World King Transformation again.</p>
<p>A group of smaller Torch Dragons unleashed their World King Transformation as rows of Torch Dragon Eyes grew out of their bodies. At the same time, they activated Bright Torch Vision World. Instantly, the entire valley was wiped clean by Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>With so many miniature Torch Dragons using the World King Transformation and Bright Torch Vision World simultaneously, it was similar to a small-scale apocalypse. Everything that could be seen, other than Torch Dragon itself, vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>However, no matter how powerful Bright Torch Vision World was, Torch Dragon was still at the Mythical stage. It couldn’t undergo Terror transformation. Without being able to see the worms, Bright Torch Vision World was ineffective against them.</p>
<p>The tiny worms rushed forward again and burrowed into the tiny Torch Dragons’ bodies. However, the tiny Torch Dragons began to split apart again. The eyes on its body split into even smaller Torch Dragons.</p>
<p>After splitting again and again, Torch Dragon stopped after splitting nine times. It had the same maximum of nine splits as the Ancient Seed Splitting Tadpole.</p>
<p>However, unlike the Ancient Splitting Tadpole, Torch Dragon didn’t have the self-destruction skill. Therefore, it only split and didn’t self-destruct. The number of tiny Torch Dragons that were produced from nine splits was already shocking.</p>
<p>With so many tiny Torch Dragons using World King Transformation and Bright Torch Vision World together, the huge Snow Valley turned into a dead zone.</p>
<p>Bright Torch Vision World was constantly superimposed onto each other. Not only did the Bright Torch Vision World between the different Torch Dragons not harm each other, but it also strengthened it by reflecting each other’s Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>In the Bright Torch Vision World that constantly reflected, Zhou Wen realized that a portion of the worms had vanished. It was as though they had been affected by the power of Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>It can’t be. Only a Terror-grade power can injure a Terror-grade. No matter how strong Torch Dragon Youngling is, it can’t undergo Terror transformation; yet, its power can actually kill the tiny worms. Could it be that those tiny worms aren’t at the Terror-grade? Zhou Wen carefully observed for a while and realized that not all the tiny worms would be destroyed by the Bright Torch Vision World. Only a portion of them would be affected.</p>
<p>However, Snow Valley suffered. It had been completely wrecked and the entire Valley of No Return was affected. If Zhou Wen hadn’t been prepared, the blood-colored avatar would probably have been destroyed by Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>As the ground was devoured by Bright Torch Vision World, a terrifying sound suddenly came from below the snow valley. A huge snow-white worm crawled out of the ground.</p>
<p>The worm was the size of a truck. It was snow-white and had six transparent wings on its back. It looked like the tiny worms.</p>
<p>As the huge worm burrowed out of the ground, the worms approached it and fused into its body like water entering the sea.</p>
<p>So that’s how it is… So this is the true body of the Terror creature. The tiny worms are just avatars that it split out… However, to be able to eliminate a portion of the Terror-grade avatars, Torch Dragon’s ability is sick. Zhou Wen immediately came to a realization.</p>
<p>The appearance of the huge worm’s true body made it apparent that it was much stronger than the tiny worms. Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World was useless against it. It flew in the Bright Torch Vision World and opened its suction cup-like mouth to suck in a tiny Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>Unlike the tiny worms, this huge worm didn’t need to enter Torch Dragon’s body at all. Furthermore, it wanted to devour Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>The tiny Torch Dragons were devoured as the other tiny Torch Dragons failed to put up much of a resistance.</p>
<p>What a pity. If Torch Dragon was also at the Terror grade, how could this huge worm be its match? Torch Dragon could probably instantly kill it with a glance. Zhou Wen wasn’t alarmed but delighted.</p>
<p>After Torch Dragon obtained the Split Life Providence, not only did its life-preservation abilities greatly increase, but its offensive strength also greatly increased. Once it advanced to the Terror grade, Zhou Wen felt that even Banana Fairy might not be able to defeat Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>How can I advance Torch Dragon to the Terror grade? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Soon, the tiny Torch Dragons were devoured by the huge worm. The phone system also indicated the death of Torch Dragon Youngling.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned Banana Fairy and Demonic Neonate as he activated his Wheel of Destiny. Clown Mask and the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder appeared at the same time.</p>
<p>However, before Zhou Wen could do anything, Banana Fairy sent out a Supreme Yin Wind. The huge worm’s body immediately flew up. When it was in the air, it gradually froze and turned into an ice sculpture.</p>
<p>Splash!</p>
<p>The huge worm landed on the ground and its huge body shattered. However, its shattered body transformed into tiny worms that gathered together again.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy frowned unhappily and blew again. However, this time, it was the Supreme Yang Wind.</p>
<p>This time, he saw the huge worm struggle in the flames with a tragic cry, but to no avail. Its wings were burned to ashes. Regardless of whether it amalgamated or dispersed, it was burned to ashes when it encountered the Supreme Yang Wind. It had no ability to resist.</p>
<p>The previously mighty worm was literally a worm in front of Banana Fairy. It was burned to death.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>With a crisp sound, a system notification popped up. ‘Killed Terror Creature Gu Mother. Discovered Dimensional Crystal.’</p>
<p>It’s not a Companion Egg? Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed as he looked at the crystal that dropped and realized that it was an 87 Essence Energy crystal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to pick up the Essence Energy Crystal and use it himself, but he realized that Banana Fairy was staring at him. No, she was looking at the Essence Energy Crystal in his hand.</p>
<p>“You want this?” Zhou Wen asked Banana Fairy.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy nodded immediately. She looked like she really wanted it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hesitated for a moment before handing the Essence Energy Crystal to Banana Fairy. After Banana Fairy obtained the dimensional crystal, it immediately transformed into threads of light that fused into her body.</p>
<p>Soon, the 87-Essence Energy crystal completely vanished. As for Banana Fairy, she looked like she hadn’t had enough.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at Banana Fairy’s stats and realized that her Essence Energy had already reached 87, while the other three stats were still 82.</p>
<p>I see. So Terror-grade creatures are the same as humans. They need to absorb Essence Energy Crystals to increase their stats. They aren’t born with full stats. Zhou Wen was delighted and worried.</p>
<p>He was happy that he finally knew how to ensure Banana Fairy’s continued growth, but he was worried about where to get so many stat crystals for himself and Banana Fairy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could still use Mythical stat crystals, but Banana Fairy had to use Terror-grade stat crystals. Only Terror-grade creatures dropped them.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I have to make another trip to the sapphire sky in the underground sea and the Endless Sea of Stars. Zhou Wen thought to himself about the dungeons he had downloaded and the possibility of any Terror creatures.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1142'>Chapter 1142: Battling the Sapphire Sky Again</h3>
<p>It was unknown if the Planet Devourer in the Endless Sea of Stars was at the Terror grade, but the huge dimensional creature in the Sapphire Sky was definitely at the Terror grade.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen found it odd. Why were Torch Dragon and Qiongqi who were guarding the temple at the Mythical stage while there was a Terror-grade creature in the Sapphire Sky?</p>
<p>Could it be that the temple isn’t the core of the Zhuolu ruins? The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that it was right.</p>
<p>Sapphire Sky, Longevity Tree, Demon Blood True Dragon Guardian, White Bone Desert, and other places had all sorts of mysteries. In contrast, the temple wasn’t as exaggerated.</p>
<p>Although there was a powerful creature like Torch Dragon, it was only a youngling. It hadn’t even reached the Terror grade.</p>
<p>After killing the Gu Mother, Zhou Wen left the Valley of No Return dungeon because he didn’t know how long it would take for it to respawn. He headed for the Zhuolu underground sea to hunt the Terror creature in the Sapphire Sky.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen and Banana Fairy needed to raise their stats. As for Demonic Neonate, she hadn’t truly advanced to the Terror grade. Her stats had reached their limits, so she couldn’t raise them for the time being.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen’s situation was similar to Demonic Neonate’s. However, humans had just advanced to the Mythical stage. They weren’t like Demonic Neonate who had maxed out her stats from the beginning. They still needed to slowly raise their stats.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the underground sea, the nine black dragons had already respawned. Zhou Wen first grinded the nine dragons, and another Companion Egg dropped.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen already had seven Demon Blood True Dragon Companion Beasts. Only the last two types hadn’t been obtained.</p>
<p>Since the Demon Blood True Dragon with the Wu character hadn’t dropped a Companion Egg all this while, the other Demon Blood True Dragons couldn’t fuse. There was a constant indication that the main core was lacking. This made Zhou Wen suspect that the Demon Blood True Dragon with the Wu dragon pearl was the main core.</p>
<p>The Guardian in the war wagon was gone. Guardians weren’t like dimensional creatures and wouldn’t respawn.</p>
<p>I wonder how much that Guardian in Ant City has grown. With my present abilities, with Banana and Demonic Neonate, I should be able to kill her, right? Zhou Wen planned on giving it a try later.</p>
<p>After coming out of the sea, Zhou Wen looked up at the Sapphire Sky. The behemoth was in there and could be seen from afar.</p>
<p>The Sapphire Sky was clearly solid, but the behemoth swam around the Sapphire Sky as though it wasn’t solid but ordinary seawater.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously attempted to shatter the Sapphire Sky, but the sapphire was abnormally hard. The power of a Mythical could only leave faint marks on it. It was impossible to shatter it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully observed the creature in the Sapphire Sky. The creature looked very strange. Its entire body was blue and translucent. Its upper body resembled a human’s body. It also had arms and hands, but its lower body didn’t have legs. It had many blue ribbon-like objects.</p>
<p>Its head was also different from humans. It looked like a jellyfish without any human facial features.</p>
<p>It wandered in the Sapphire Sky and occasionally swept its gaze over the blood-colored avatar, as though it was also observing it. Clearly, it had long discovered the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, it didn’t leave the Sapphire Sky to attack the blood-colored avatar. It only occasionally moved its jellyfish-like head beneath the Sapphire Sky to observe the blood-colored avatar and the Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Could it be that the Sapphire Sky is actually a prison? An idea flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind as he thought of this possibility.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been to the underground sea countless times, but apart from being attacked when he approached the Sapphire Sky, he was never in danger.</p>
<p>If it’s really imprisoned here, who imprisoned it? Why is it imprisoned here? Zhou Wen didn’t have any more clues and couldn’t figure it out.</p>
<p>After summoning Banana Fairy and Demonic Neonate, Demonic Neonate summoned Grim Demon.</p>
<p>Back when he had fought Di Tian, after Wang Mingyuan suppressed Grim Demon, he had used Grim Demon’s identity to enter the cube’s arena. Later, when Zhou Wen returned, Wang Mingyuan had imprisoned Zhou Wen in Fangzhang Mountain, and Grim Demon returned.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was trapped, and Grim Demon had been sealed in the Demonic Sword the entire time. He had no chance of coming out.</p>
<p>Now, to kill the dimensional creature in the Sapphire Sky, Grim Demon would come in handy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen got the blood-colored avatar to stand far away as Banana Fairy and Grim Demon approached the Sapphire Sky.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy blew a gust of Supreme Yin Wind at the Sapphire Sky from afar, but the Supreme Yin Wind was blocked by the Sapphire Sky. It couldn’t enter, so it naturally couldn’t injure the dimensional creature.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately felt that something was amiss. Although the Sapphire Sky trapped the dimensional creature, it also prevented anyone from killing it.</p>
<p>That thing was indeed extraordinary, considering how even the Terror-grade Supreme Yin Wind couldn’t stir the Sapphire Sky.</p>
<p>Seeing that the Supreme Yin Wind had failed, Grim Demon emitted a terrifying demonic aura that swept towards the Sapphire Sky.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Grim Demon’s punch struck the Sapphire Sky, creating a huge crater more than two meters in diameter. Although the destructive power was shocking, it was just a tiny gap in the entire sapphire sky—as inconspicuous as a needle eye.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after Grim Demon retracted his fist, sapphire shards automatically flew back and filled up the shattered hole. Soon, it returned to its original state without any trace of it being damaged.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was even more alarmed. The power of the Sapphire Sky was clearly not self-healing; it was more like an ability like Time Reversal.</p>
<p>Just as Grim Demon retracted his palm, the dimensional creature in the Sapphire Sky emitted a blue beam of light that blasted out through the Sapphire Sky.</p>
<p>The dazzling light was so intense that it was almost blinding, but after passing through the Sapphire Sky, it became much weaker. It was extremely weak by the time it reached Grim Demon.</p>
<p>Even without using the Wheel of Destiny, Zhou Wen could see the blue beam.</p>
<p>This meant that the power of the blue beam was almost below the Terror grade. That was why it could be seen by the human eye.</p>
<p>Grim Demon was very disdainful of such weak strength. With a casual wave of his hand, he shot out a demonic beam, hoping to shatter the blue beam.</p>
<p>However, after the demonic aura came into contact with the blue light, the latter didn’t shatter. Instead, it seeped into the demonic aura, causing a strange blue color to suffuse the black demonic aura.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the blueness in the demonic aura became more and more obvious. Soon, the demonic aura that Grim Demon produced turned into sapphire.</p>
<p>Eh, that’s odd. Why can the Sapphire Sky block and weaken the power of dimensional creatures, but the dazzling light it emits can transform demonic aura into something like the Sapphire Sky? Zhou Wen found it odd.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1143'>Chapter 1143: It’s a Long Story</h3>
<p>After some thought, he couldn’t think of a reasonable explanation. All Zhou Wen could do was get Grim Demon and Banana Fairy to continue attacking.</p>
<p>However, across the Sapphire Sky, Grim Demon and Banana Fairy’s powers were almost unable to injure the dimensional creature. The dazzling blue beam released by the dimensional creature was greatly weakened. It could only barely transform the demonic aura into sapphire. Furthermore, the blue beams dissipated not long after passing through the Sapphire Sky. It couldn’t exist for long.</p>
<p>However, this was already very shocking. Be it Grim Demon’s demonic aura or Banana Fairy’s wind, none of them could completely eliminate the blue beam.</p>
<p>Even if one’s strength was far stronger than the blue beam, it would be permeated by the blue beam and become a part of the demonic aura or wind before slowly turning into sapphire.</p>
<p>However, due to the power of the dazzling light being too weak, it could only convert a tiny portion of the demonic aura or wind into sapphire-like crystals before being exhausted.</p>
<p>After shattering, the demonic aura and wind that had turned into sapphire would automatically fly to the Sapphire Sky, becoming a part of it.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Is it imprisoned here or did it trap itself? Could it be that it can only survive in the Sapphire Sky? It will die if it leaves the Sapphire Sky, so it tries to turn everything into sapphire? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that this idea wasn’t too reliable.</p>
<p>However, since he couldn’t break through the Sapphire Sky’s obstruction, it was impossible for him to kill the Terror creature. Zhou Wen had no choice but to change his strategy and use the Terror form of Great Brahma.</p>
<p>Great Brahma was in a Spirit Body state, something that Zhou Wen wanted to exploit to see if it could pass through the Sapphire Sky.</p>
<p>The four-faced and eight-armed Great Brahma flew towards the Sapphire Sky. The black hole behind him was like the entrance to hell, as though it could devour everything. It also seemed like countless evil spirits were about to crawl out.</p>
<p>It really passed through! Zhou Wen watched as Great Brahma entered the Sapphire Sky. Just like the dimensional creature, Great Brahma looked like it had entered water. His actions were slowed down a little but weren’t too affected.</p>
<p>The ribbon on the lower half of the dimensional creature’s body danced as it shimmered with blue light that swept towards Great Brahma.</p>
<p>As they were in the Sapphire Sky, the might of the dazzling blue beam wasn’t weakened. It was unimaginably terrifying.</p>
<p>Great Brahma was still sitting cross-legged with his eight hands forming different hand seals. The expressions on the three faces were also different. Only the face facing the black hole had no discernible expression.</p>
<p>Only when the blue beam descended in front of Great Brahma did he strike out with a palm.</p>
<p>The blue beam was extinguished by Great Brahma’s palm as though a candle had been extinguished.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, Great Brahma is unstoppable! Zhou Wen was overjoyed, but he could also tell that the dimensional creature inside the Sapphire Sky was undoubtedly a soul. Great Brahma was most effective against such creatures.</p>
<p>Great Brahma could almost be said to be the nemesis of ghosts and souls. At the same level, creatures like ghosts were unable to put up a fight.</p>
<p>Although the dimensional creature inside the Sapphire Sky was a Spirit Body, it was somewhat different from ordinary ghosts. It wasn’t completely suppressed by Great Brahma as it constantly emitted blue beams to fight.</p>
<p>Its figure floated erratically in the Sapphire Sky as though it could teleport. It appeared around Great Brahma as blue beams constantly bombarded him.</p>
<p>However, no matter how strange and powerful the blue beams were, they were suppressed by Great Brahma’s palm. They immediately dimmed and were extinguished, making the attack meaningless.</p>
<p>“Nicely done. Kill it!” Zhou Wen directed Great Brahma to kill the dimensional creature.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen soon realized gloomily that Great Brahma wouldn’t take the initiative to attack. He would only counterattack when his opponent attacked.</p>
<p>Great Brahma’s counterattacks were clearly insufficient to kill the dimensional creature.</p>
<p>It can’t be! Great Brahma only knows how to be beaten up? Zhou Wen found it unbelievable. With his understanding of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, it didn’t seem to be the case.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Great Brahma had four faces. One was heartless, one was bliss, and the other was filled with pity. Although the fourth face remained unknown, the three faces made him unlikely to be someone who only knew how to take a beating.</p>
<p>Did something go wrong? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sank his mind into Great Brahma. It was born from him and was equivalent to his avatar. Zhou Wen immediately received some information about Great Brahma, making his expression change.</p>
<p>Although Great Brahma was nurtured by Zhou Wen, it didn’t mean that he understood everything about it.</p>
<p>Great Brahma’s power didn’t only come from Zhou Wen. It also came from the profundity of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra and the Guardian’s blood that served as a foundation. Therefore, the Terror-form Great Brahma was actually an extremely complicated individual. Even Zhou Wen found it difficult to understand everything about him.</p>
<p>From the basic information he received, the power that Great Brahma used in battle was actually only a quarter of his total strength.</p>
<p>He had a total of four faces, and each face represented a different power. Now, what was really used in battle was the expressionless side in front.</p>
<p>The power of the left and right faces wasn’t used for combat, so they weren’t suitable for attacking.</p>
<p>And the last face that even Zhou Wen couldn’t see hid an extremely terrifying power. Even as Great Brahma’s owner, Zhou Wen felt his heart palpitate as though there was something terrifying about it. Once it was activated, even the owner couldn’t predict the outcome.</p>
<p>However, this was in-game, so Zhou Wen naturally didn’t have any qualms. He directly activated the unknown face of Great Brahma.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen issued the order, Great Brahma finally did something different. The face facing the black hole slowly turned around.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what the face looked like. He was staring at the side of his face that was spinning, when he suddenly realized that the scene around him had undergone a strange change.</p>
<p>The black hole that was like a Buddhistic glow behind Great Brahma gradually expanded as he turned around.</p>
<p>Before Great Brahma could fully turn his head, the black hole had already devoured the Sapphire Sky. Countless evil spirits roared out of it, turning the underground sea into hell.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only saw Great Brahma’s side profile. Before he could see it clearly, the game screen suddenly turned black.</p>
<p>As a dark cloud hung over him, Zhou Wen was rendered speechless. He was probably the first person in history to be killed by his Terror form power.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, I’m the creator of Great Brahma after all. Even I’m killed! This doesn’t make sense! Zhou Wen’s feelings were indescribable.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1144'>Chapter 1144: Tsukuyomi’s Request</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Great Brahma’s fourth face was definitely a powerful killing machine. It was extremely powerful at the Terror grade, but its indiscriminate killing was a huge problem.</p>
<p>Great Brahma was Zhou Wen’s Terror form, so he couldn’t put too much distance between him and Great Brahma. Otherwise, Great Brahma would automatically return to his body.</p>
<p>​ </p>
<p>Unless Zhou Wen could withstand the power of Great Brahma’s fourth face, using it again was equivalent to suicide.</p>
<p>Great Brahma’s power seems somewhat similar to Truth Listener. Could there be a relationship between the two? Zhou Wen felt that the power of Great Brahma’s fourth face was indeed somewhat similar to Truth Listener when it released six earrings. It just wasn’t as strong.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was considering how to use Great Brahma’s power when Tsukuyomi walked over.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Zhou Wen looked up at Tsukuyomi and asked.</p>
<p>“The game is boring.” Although Tsukuyomi was holding her phone, she had already quit the game.</p>
<p>“Why don’t I take you to get something to eat?” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“Human food is no different from rocks to me. It is all material energy,” Tsukuyomi said indifferently.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately felt a headache. If he were made to kill dimensional creatures, he could think of a way to defeat his opponent.</p>
<p>However, he really couldn’t guess a woman’s thoughts.</p>
<p>“Have you been to school?” Tsukuyomi suddenly asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Of course.” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled, unsure why Tsukuyomi would suddenly ask such a question.</p>
<p>“What’s it like to go to school?” Tsukuyomi asked again.</p>
<p>“It’s just studying. What else would it be?” Zhou Wen found Tsukuyomi’s question odd.</p>
<p>“Then take me to school,” Tsukuyomi blinked and said.</p>
<p>“School?” Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss. He didn’t know what Tsukuyomi meant.</p>
<p>“Dimensional creatures are born with knowledge, so there’s no concept of schooling. I want to know what it’s like to go to school. Take me there,” Tsukuyomi said seriously.</p>
<p>So that’s how it is. Zhou Wen thought about it and realized that it was true. Dimensional creatures really didn’t need to study like humans.</p>
<p>However, Tsukuyomi’s request left Zhou Wen in a dilemma.</p>
<p>A school wasn’t like street markets. It wasn’t a place he could go as he wished. Although Zhou Wen had been a student in the past, he hadn’t graduated. Five years had passed and his former classmates had already graduated. Zhou Wen also had no intention of returning to school to study.</p>
<p>Looking at Tsukuyomi’s expression, Zhou Wen knew that they had to go. After some thought, he had an idea.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be difficult for Zhou Wen to take Tsukuyomi into Sunset College, but it would be too dangerous. If Tsukuyomi ended up p*ssed and started a massacre at Sunset College, no one would be able to stop her. It would probably result in a bloodbath in Luoyang.</p>
<p>However, he had to agree to Tsukuyomi’s request. Otherwise, she would immediately fall out with him.</p>
<p>Therefore, after weighing the pros and cons, Zhou Wen planned on taking Tsukuyomi to the Royal College and letting her experience and enjoy the school’s atmosphere for two days.</p>
<p>Royal College was a very famous university in the Federation. It was ranked above Sunset College.</p>
<p>Royal College didn’t usually recruit foreign students. It was a school that only the children of the Cape family and its vassal families could attend. The people inside were basically people related to the Cape family.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have a good relationship with the Cape family. Although he didn’t go so far as to destroy the Cape family, any nasty job or operation was linked to them.</p>
<p>After making up his mind, Zhou Wen led Tsukuyomi to the Royal College in West District.</p>
<p>The two of them had spatial powers, so they naturally didn’t need to walk. After Zhou Wen explained the location, Tsukuyomi directly teleported him over. Tsukuyomi’s long-distance teleportation was fast and accurate, much better than Zhou Wen’s. As expected of a Calamity. Zhou Wen only sighed. His level was still lacking.</p>
<p>It was definitely too late to complete the matriculation procedures now. Zhou Wen didn’t plan on really studying. All he wanted to do was take Tsukuyomi around, so he planned on just gate-crashing certain classes.</p>
<p>Royal College was a sealed college. It was difficult for outsiders to enter, but to Zhou Wen, it was just a matter of teleportation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi appeared out of nowhere in Royal College without attracting anyone’s attention.</p>
<p>“Is this a school?” Tsukuyomi looked around as though she was very curious.</p>
<p>“Yes, this is one of the most famous schools for humans,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Whose statue is that? Why is it placed there?” Tsukuyomi pointed at a spot near the entrance and asked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned his head and saw a statue erected at the school’s entrance. It was a person holding a sword that was slashing at the sky.</p>
<p>Although it was only a statue, it revealed a might that seemed to slice the sky into two.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the statue’s posture and found it somewhat familiar. When he carefully looked at the statue’s face, he was immediately enlightened. Wasn’t this him slicing through Di Tian’s nine firmaments?</p>
<p>“This is a memorial statue. The engraved figure is called Human Sovereign.” Zhou Wen felt a little embarrassed when he introduced it to Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>“The Human Sovereign who defeated Di Tian in the cube’s arena?” Tsukuyomi clearly knew of Human Sovereign’s deeds.</p>
<p>In fact, as long as one went online, it was very easy to obtain information regarding Human Sovereign. It wasn’t strange for Tsukuyomi to know.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Zhou Wen answered with a nod, pretending that it had nothing to do with him.</p>
<p>The two of them chatted as they walked in Royal College. Zhou Wen originally believed that it wouldn’t be difficult to gatecrash on campus.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he had forgotten that this was Royal College. Furthermore, it only recruited students from families like the Capes, so basically everyone in this school was from the West District.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi looked like people from the East District. After walking around the school for a while, they attracted the attention of many people.</p>
<p>Thankfully, most of the students were only curious and looked at them a few more times without any intention of stopping them.</p>
<p>After walking for a while, a female student finally walked over and stopped them. “Are you students from Bright Prospects College?”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen didn’t deny it as he asked.</p>
<p>“I especially admire your school’s Professor Tomorrow. I heard that he’s leading a team to our Royal College for an exchange. Is that true? Will he go on stage to give a speech? Can I ask you to help me get the signature of Professor Tomorrow?” the girl said it all in one breath.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I don’t know Professor Tomorrow. It’s best you ask him yourself.” Zhou Wen obviously didn’t know Professor Tomorrow.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you students from Bright Prospects College? How can you not know Professor Tomorrow?” the girl said in disbelief.</p>
<p>“I really don’t know him,” Zhou Wen repeated before preparing to leave with Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>“It’s fine if you don’t want to help. Why are you lying? You’re clearly walking towards the venue,” the girl muttered as she followed. Zhou Wen and company were heading in the direction of the venue.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1145'>Chapter 1145: Swordsman Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The two of them saw that there were many students gathered at the venue ahead. Tsukuyomi was intrigued as she walked over.</p>
<p>“What are they doing?” Tsukuyomi looked at the students and asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Didn’t the student just say that a person named Professor Tomorrow is coming here to give a lecture?” Zhou Wen said casually.</p>
<p>“What do humans teach during lectures? Is it the knowledge known as science? Will it teach me how to make phones?” Tsukuyomi asked curiously.</p>
<p>“That might not be the case.” Although Zhou Wen didn’t know who Professor Tomorrow was, he believed that it wasn’t about scientific knowledge. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be so popular.</p>
<p>Humans in this era were far more interested in Companion Beasts and cultivation than in scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>“Can we listen in too?” Tsukuyomi asked.</p>
<p>“Of course.” Zhou Wen found two seats and sat down with Tsukuyomi, preparing to attend Professor Tomorrow’s class.</p>
<p>To their surprise, after a while, the girl who had spoken to them came in. When she saw Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi, she took the initiative to walk over.</p>
<p>“Why are you sitting here? Doesn’t Bright Prospects College have special seats?” the girl asked the two of them in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“We’ll just sit here and watch,” Zhou Wen replied.</p>
<p>The girl looked at Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi and seemed to come to a realization. “You want to know the true evaluation our Royal College students have of you, right? Actually, you don’t have to worry. Although Bright Prospects College’s ranking isn’t high in the Federation, with an existence like Professor Tomorrow teaching there, no one dares to underestimate the students of Bright Prospects College, much less Professor Tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“You admire Professor Tomorrow?” Tsukuyomi’s curiosity was piqued by the girl. She now wanted to know what kind of person Professor Tomorrow was.</p>
<p>“Of course, everyone who uses a sword worships Professor Tomorrow. In the battle at East Sun Mountain, if Professor Tomorrow hadn’t single-handedly entered the dimensional creature tide and killed nineteen Mythical creatures, as well as the Terror creature in the lead, I’m afraid the city at the foot of East Sun Mountain would have been massacred… At the bank of Futu River, Professor Tomorrow assassinated the leader of the Guardians who presided over the Futu Conference, preventing the League of Guardians’s conspiracy from succeeding…” When the girl spoke of Professor Tomorrow’s various deeds, she described him like a god descending to the mortal world.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen broke out into a cold sweat for the girl when he heard that. She spent most of her time explaining how powerful Professor Tomorrow was and how many dimensional creatures he had killed.</p>
<p>Little did she know that Tsukuyomi, who was beside her, was a genuine dimensional creature. Furthermore, she was a virtually invincible Calamity-grade existence. She could kill her countless times with a single spit.</p>
<p>“In short, Professor Tomorrow is handsome, has a good temper, is extremely powerful, and is very humble. He’s practically a perfect Prince Charming. He’s the idol of many students at our school…” The girl talked non-stop about Professor Tomorrow as if she had endless praise for him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled when he heard that. Professor Tomorrow could actually kill a Terror-grade creature. His strength was considered top-notch among humans.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the sound of it, Professor Tomorrow didn’t seem old. He could be considered young and promising.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi was also very intrigued. She waited for Professor Tomorrow’s arrival, hoping to see what kind of person he was.</p>
<p>The number of students at the venue gradually increased. The staff were all busy with work. In today’s society, a strong person like Professor Tomorrow was even more famous than the celebrities of yesteryear. Even Royal College didn’t dare to slight him.</p>
<p>The venue was almost full. Before Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi saw Professor Tomorrow, they already heard the girls scream.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow… Tomorrow…” The girls’ screams were like a tsunami’s roar.</p>
<p>The girl beside Zhou Wen also stood up and shouted ‘Tomorrow’ with the other girls. However, she was still sweeping her gaze in search. Clearly, she hadn’t seen Professor Tomorrow yet. Her vision was blocked by the person in front.</p>
<p>After a while, a handsome young man walked up to the podium. At this moment, the shouting reached its climax. Thankfully, this was an outdoor venue. Otherwise, the roof would have been overturned by the tsunami-like sound waves.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi looked at the young man on stage with interest. When Zhou Wen saw the young man, he couldn’t help but be taken aback. This was because he actually knew Professor Tomorrow.</p>
<p>Strange, isn’t his name Ming Xiu? When did he change his name to Tomorrow? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>Five years had changed Ming Xiu from a boy to a man. He stood on the podium calmly and elegantly. He gestured with his hands and the ear-piercing screams stopped.</p>
<p>“Thank you for all your love and support. What would you like to hear from me?” Ming Xiu said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow Sword Art…” the students said almost in unison.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was taken aback again as he recalled that the name Tomorrow Sword Art was named by him.</p>
<p>“Professor Ming, you are known as Swordsman Tomorrow. If swordsmen aren’t talking about sword arts, are they going to teach us how to dance?” a bold male student joked.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu didn’t mind. He smiled and said, “This student is right. I’m a swordsman. All my life, I’ve only learned how to use a sword. The only thing I can teach you is sword arts.”</p>
<p>“Professor Ming, I heard that your Tomorrow Sword Art was self-created. Is it true?” another boy asked.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu said seriously, “Tomorrow Sword Art wasn’t independently created by me. The so-called self-creation is actually just a rumor. The reason I can master the Tomorrow Sword Art is because of two people.”</p>
<p>“Which two?” a student immediately asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Do you want to hear me tell a story or do you want to hear me talk about sword arts?” Ming Xiu said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Both!” Noticing Ming Xiu’s good nature, many students jested.</p>
<p>“Then let’s talk about sword arts first,” Ming Xiu said as he began talking about sword arts.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu was already one of the few sword experts in the Federation. Although most of these students came from wealthy families and had seen many experts since they were young, they still listened with relish. Many of the things Ming Xiu said were very novel and different from what they had heard in the past.</p>
<p>The girl beside Zhou Wen listened attentively, her eyes filled with admiration for Ming Xiu.</p>
<p>However, Tsukuyomi felt bored after listening for a while. The anticipation she had for Ming Xiu was completely gone.</p>
<p>In fact, at the level of Tsukuyomi, Ming Xiu’s realm was indeed much weaker. The things he said were completely unable to pique her interest.</p>
<p>“The famous Tomorrow Sword Art among humans is nothing much after all,” Tsukuyomi said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“It’s indeed a little lacking.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.</p>
<p>Although Ming Xiu’s realm was considered top-notch among humans, such a realm was still inferior to Zhou Wen’s. Ming Xiu’s realm had also improved more slowly than he had expected.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1146'>Chapter 1146: Meeting</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>When the girl beside them heard their conversation, she immediately sized them up suspiciously and asked, “Are you guys students from Bright Prospects College or not?”</p>
<p>Without waiting for Zhou Wen to answer, the girl seemed to come to a realization. “I get it. You aren’t students at Bright Prospects College, but like Professor Ming, you are tutors at Bright Prospects College. You are jealous of Professor Ming because of his popularity, right?”</p>
<p>​ </p>
<p>With that said, the girl seemed to get where Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi were coming from. She reached out to pat Zhou Wen on the shoulder and said, “It’s not your fault that your talent and accomplishments aren’t as good as others, but to speak ill of others behind their backs out of jealousy is not a good thing. I can understand your feelings. Seeing the gap between yourself and a genius grow bigger and bigger really makes one feel despair. However, one has to be honest or one will easily suffer a beating. Many of the students here are fans of Professor Ming.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked around and realized that there were indeed many students glaring at the two of them. Their conversation had already incited public anger.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen smiled and didn’t say another word. However, Tsukuyomi didn’t have the mindset of a human, nor did she care what humans thought. She continued, “The sword art is indeed very ordinary. I’m just telling the truth.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>The Tomorrow Sword Art is very ordinary? When the students beside them heard this evaluation, they were even more certain that Tsukuyomi and Zhou Wen were jealous of Ming Xiu.</p>
<p>That was a sword art that had once killed a Terror-grade creature. If such a sword art was considered ordinary, then were the sword arts they cultivated even called sword arts?</p>
<p>All the students glared at Tsukuyomi. If it wasn’t because of her beauty, they probably would have spat at her.</p>
<p>The girl beside them had already confirmed that Tsukuyomi and Zhou Wen were teachers from Bright Prospects College. They were jealous of Ming Xiu, so she decided to ignore them.</p>
<p>Some of the more radical students were eager to teach Tsukuyomi and Zhou Wen a lesson.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this was a venue on campus. They definitely couldn’t get into a brawl. This, in a way, saved their lives. If they really dared to rush forward, even if the tutors and the school’s leaders attacked together, they wouldn’t be able to escape being completely wiped out.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Tsukuyomi didn’t say anything else. Instead, she got up and prepared to leave the venue. She really seemed bored.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to get up and leave with her. He also knew that leaving now was the best choice. Otherwise, if those students really angered Tsukuyomi, the outcome would be unimaginable.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi leave, the students thought that they had left in embarrassment, so they ignored them.</p>
<p>The commotion attracted Ming Xiu’s attention. When Ming Xiu saw Zhou Wen’s figure, his body immediately trembled as an unbelievable look of pleasant surprise flashed in his eyes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt Ming Xiu’s gaze and turned his head to nod at him.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Understanding Zhou Wen’s intentions, Ming Xiu held back his surprise and nodded in response. He stood on the podium and continued lecturing.</p>
<p>After leaving the venue, the two of them strolled around other places in the school. It only left Tsukuyomi very disappointed. She originally imagined that she could learn more of humanity’s scientific knowledge and technological products.</p>
<p>To her surprise, the school was filled with people teaching Essence Energy Arts and Essence Energy Skills. It was rare to see high-tech subjects.</p>
<p>In fact, ever since dimensional creatures broke through the restrictions on a large scale, humans had no choice but to retreat into dimensional zones. The importance of physics, biology, and other subjects had declined greatly. Very few people focused on studying related subjects. Most of them only completed the compulsory classes in order to pass the tests. Most of their energy was spent on cultivation and hunting dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>“It’s boring. Let’s go.” After circling around, Tsukuyomi was already a little sick of it. Furthermore, she didn’t have the interest from before. She didn’t wish to stay here any longer. This was far from the school she had imagined.</p>
<p>“I’m meeting a friend. Let’s wait a while. Let’s have a break over there,” Zhou Wen said as he pointed at the flower bed not far away.</p>
<p>“That Swordsman Tomorrow is your friend?” Tsukuyomi seemed to have realized something. The silent communication between the two of them hadn’t escaped her notice.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Zhou Wen didn’t plan on hiding it. He knew that he definitely couldn’t hide his prior actions from Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t signaled to Ming Xiu just now, Ming Xiu might have jumped down from the podium. That would have been even worse.</p>
<p>The two of them sat down on the flower bed. It was rather quiet nearby.</p>
<p>“Your strength and realm are much stronger than that Swordsman Tomorrow. Why is he so famous, but those students don’t recognize you?” Tsukuyomi asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“I don’t like fame,” Zhou Wen said with a shrug.</p>
<p>Just as Tsukuyomi was about to say something, she saw a few students walking over. Furthermore, they were looking around as though they were searching for something.</p>
<p>“Why are you here? Did you see Professor Ming?” The girl who had been sitting beside Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi was among them. When she saw the two of them, her eyes lit up as she ran over with a few students.</p>
<p>She believed that Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi were Ming Xiu’s colleagues. Ming Xiu had previously headed in their direction and was likely looking for them. If she followed them, she might be able to encounter Ming Xiu.</p>
<p>She also felt that she had an obligation to let Ming Xiu know that the two of them were speaking ill of him behind his back. She wanted him to be careful of Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>In her eyes, Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi were scheming b*tches who acted differently on the surface. The kind and adorable Ming Xiu must have been fooled by them. He didn’t know their true colors and treated them as friends. Who knew if he might be secretly harmed by them in the future.</p>
<p>The more she thought about it, the more she felt that she should let Ming Xiu recognize these two scheming b*tches. Otherwise, he would inevitably suffer in the future.</p>
<p>Just as this was on her mind, she saw Ming Xiu walk over. This made the girl feel that her deduction was correct.</p>
<p>The girls surrounded him, wanting to tell Ming Xiu about the two scheming b*tches.</p>
<p>However, Ming Xiu’s figure flashed and passed through them. He ignored them and arrived in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Coach, I finally get to see you again. I’ve missed you so much!” Ming Xiu gave Zhou Wen a hug.</p>
<p>Although everyone knew that Zhou Wen was in Luoyang and Ming Xiu had seen him in Luoyang over the past five years, Ming Xiu knew that it wasn’t the real Zhou Wen despite the person looking identical and flawless.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>However, Ming Xiu kept this matter to himself and didn’t say it out loud. He felt uneasy, uncertain about what had happened to Zhou Wen. Only when he saw Zhou Wen today did he finally relax.</p>
<p>The girls widened their mouths as they looked at Ming Xiu and Zhou Wen. Their expressions turned abnormally odd as an ominous thought surfaced in their minds.</p>
<p>Could it be that Professor Ming likes men…</p>
<h3 id='chapter1147'>Chapter 1147: Five Years in the Federation</h3>
<p>“Um… Excuse me… Professor Ming… Is he your colleague?” a female classmate asked hopefully.</p>
<p>“No, he’s my coach,” Ming Xiu answered.</p>
<p>As he didn’t know if Zhou Wen would expose his identity, he didn’t mention his name.</p>
<p>“Coach?” Many scenes surfaced in the girls’ minds.</p>
<p>Time: night; location: training room; characters: Professor Ming and male coach.</p>
<p>Professor Ming, who was only in sports attire, took off his top because it was too hot, revealing his sweaty, firm chest.</p>
<p>The shameless male coach leaned against Ming Xiu from behind with one hand on his waist and the other hand holding Ming Xiu’s sword. He even pretended to correct Ming Xiu’s actions, but…</p>
<p>It’s not like that… It’s definitely not like that… The girl from before didn’t believe that Ming Xiu was such a person. She anxiously asked, “Professor Ming, your relationship with him isn’t what we are thinking, right?”</p>
<p>Ming Xiu imagined that they didn’t believe that Zhou Wen was his coach, so he said, “It’s exactly it. Tomorrow Sword Art was named by Coach. Without Coach, there’s no Tomorrow Sword Art.”</p>
<p>Tomorrow Sword Art is actually a love memento! The girls felt as though they had been struck by lightning as they felt their beliefs crumble instantly.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu clearly wasn’t in the mood to talk to them. He pulled Zhou Wen and said, “Coach, this isn’t a place to talk. Let’s find a place with no one around to have a good chat…”</p>
<p>No one around… Have a chat… The girls were petrified as an indescribable scene surfaced in their minds.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed Ming Xiu out of the flower garden. Tsukuyomi silently followed behind them without doing anything out of line.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu found a private lounge and used a Companion Beast with sound-proofing abilities. He looked at Tsukuyomi and saw Zhou Wen nod slightly. Only then did he chat with Zhou Wen and tell him about what had happened in the Federation over the past few years.</p>
<p>In the past five years, the dimension hadn’t activated the cube rankings again, nor had it chosen a new King of Earth.</p>
<p>However, there were already quite a number of Guardians on Earth and they had established the League of Guardians. Many Senators were members of the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>Therefore, many Federation resolutions were influenced by the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>The previous president had died for some baffling reason. Many people suspected that it had something to do with the League of Guardians because the previous president was a member of the anti-Guardian faction.</p>
<p>Now, President Hui Haifeng didn’t openly oppose Guardians, but he had been secretly working hard, hoping to escape the League of Guardians’s influence on the Federation and the Senate.</p>
<p>However, from the looks of it, the efforts were fruitless.</p>
<p>Although Hui Haifeng had developed the Mythical Serum, it was very difficult to rely on it to advance to the Mythical stage. It was even more difficult to advance to the Terror grade using it.</p>
<p>The Federation was actually still controlled by the League of Guardians. There was no lack of powerful Terror-grade Guardians in the League of Guardians. In five years, many Guardians had grown stronger.</p>
<p>“You used the Mythical Serum?” Zhou Wen looked at Ming Xiu and saw that the body under his clothes was in a strange crystalline state, like jade.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu nodded slightly. “I’d rather become a monster than bow to those Guardians.”</p>
<p>“What about Qiuyan?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“He also used the Mythical Serum. He’s stronger than me,” Ming Xiu answered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what to say. Although he knew that humans had the possibility of advancing to the Mythical stage, that path was too difficult. Apart from himself, Xia Jiuhuang was the only other person Zhou Wen knew that had taken this path.</p>
<p>However, it was difficult to say if Xia Jiuhuang had truly succeeded. After all, he had ultimately borrowed the power of the Guardian in the log. It was impossible to determine if he had advanced to the Mythical stage independently.</p>
<p>“Who’s in charge of the League of Guardians now?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“There are four Guardian Heavenly Kings in the League of Guardians. They are Blood Shaman, Cave Era, Hermit, and Great Skyfiend. They are all Terror-grade existences, but they aren’t the true leaders of the League of Guardians. Up to now, no one has seen his true face. All we know is that the Guardians of the League of Guardians call him Immortal,” Ming Xiu said.</p>
<p>After a pause, Ming Xiu continued, “Apart from the League of Guardians, there’s also an organization that specializes in hunting Guardians. It’s called the Holy Spirit Association. The entire organization is very mysterious and it’s very difficult to find any traces of them. The president of the Holy Spirit Association is Ya, who previously occupied first place on the cube.”</p>
<p>“From your tone, you seem to be very displeased with the Holy Spirit Association. It doesn’t seem to be a problem for them to hunt Guardians, right?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu sighed and said, “It’s fine if it’s just hunting Guardians, but they don’t differentiate between good and bad. They don’t care if the humans who contract with Guardians are good or bad either. They kill them all. They don’t even spare the humans who contract with Guardians. I really can’t agree with their actions. What’s the difference between such indiscriminate killing and those devils?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head and didn’t say anything else. With Zhong Ziya’s character, it was really in his character to do such a thing.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, Zhou Wen asked about the situation of the people he cared about. Ming Xiu had always paid attention to them and told Zhou Wen one by one.</p>
<p>Ya’er was taken back to the An family by An Sheng and was pampered by Ouyang Lan. To everyone’s surprise, even An Tianzuo doted on Ya’er greatly. Ya’er was now like a princess of the An family. She could have anything she wanted.</p>
<p>Li Xuan had been wandering around. Every time he returned to Luoyang, he would visit ‘Zhou Wen’ but in fact, he was visiting Ya’er.</p>
<p>As for who was impersonating the An family’s Zhou Wen, Ming Xiu didn’t know either. He only felt that it was extremely similar. He couldn’t tell the difference from his appearance. His aura and abilities were also very similar to Zhou Wen’s.</p>
<p>It was almost impossible to tell unless one was especially familiar with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The chick and antelope had also been staying at the An family’s residence. The antelope hadn’t changed much, but the chick now had the body of an eagle. The last time Ming Xiu went, he happened to see it burn a Mythical creature to death at Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan had been cultivating with Ming Xiu all these years. With the Life Providences of Ming Xiu’s Peerless Duo, the two of them improved rapidly.</p>
<p>Of course, it was mainly because their talent and efforts were rare in this world.</p>
<p>Wang Lu had officially taken over the Wang family. However, no matter where she went, she would take her sister, Wang Chan.</p>
<p>Wei Ge replaced Shen Yuchi as the Special Investigation Bureau’s director-general. However, the Special Investigation Bureau had already severed ties with its original owner, the six families, becoming a blade in the hands of the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>Many people from the six families had joined the League of Guardians, but other than the Cape family, the other families were against the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>The Zhang family had a rule that as long as one contracted with a Guardian, they would be removed from the family tree.</p>
<p>As the two of them were chatting, Zhou Wen suddenly sensed that someone was secretly approaching their lounge. After carefully sensing it, he realized that it wasn’t a pure person, but a human who had contracted a Guardian. At that moment, he was walking towards the lounge in Guardian armor.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1148'>Chapter 1148: Sword of Tomorrow</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned slightly. The Guardian was clearly targeting them, and it was highly likely that he was here for Ming Xiu.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been missing for many years and had just returned inland. Not many people knew him. Even if his enemies recognized him, they shouldn’t have taken action so quickly. At the very least, they would investigate his current situation.</p>
<p>​ </p>
<p>The Guardian didn’t deliberately hide his aura. As he approached, Ming Xiu also sensed his arrival.</p>
<p>The Guardian stopped in front of the lounge door. Although the door was closed, it didn’t affect his vision at all. He looked at Ming Xiu through the door and said, “Swordsman Tomorrow, I’ve heard so much about you. Do you dare accept my challenge?”</p>
<p>With the Guardian’s arrival, many students also discovered him. They whispered in the distance but didn’t dare approach. Clearly, they knew the Guardian.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t dare,” Ming Xiu said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow and Wind Trace are known as the two peerless masters of swords and sabers. No one can surpass them with swords and sabers. I also use swords and believe that my sword arts are alright. If I can’t win in ten strikes, it will be considered my loss,” the Guardian continued.</p>
<p>“You’ve already won.” Ming Xiu was no longer the competitive youth from before. He spoke casually without any signs of being moved.</p>
<p>“I never expected the famous Swordsman Tomorrow to be a coward. You don’t even have the courage to accept a challenge. From the looks of it, the so-called invincible Tomorrow Sword Art is just an exaggeration that serves as self-consolation for humans. A sword art created by humans ultimately can’t live up to the required standards,” the Guardian continued goading.</p>
<p>This time, Ming Xiu didn’t back down. He didn’t care about his reputation, but there were some things he absolutely couldn’t allow others to taint.</p>
<p>“Coach, please wait a moment. I’ll be back soon,” Ming Xiu said to Zhou Wen before getting up to open the door.</p>
<p>The students watching from afar became excited when they saw Ming Xiu come out.</p>
<p>The Guardian’s name was Judge, and the person he contracted was Buzz. He was a very famous Guardian of the Cape family and was also a member of the League of Guardians. Although he hadn’t advanced to the Terror grade, he had already gained some fame in the Federation with the ability, Sword of Judgment.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Ming Xiu had once killed a branch leader of the League of Guardians and destroyed a plan hatched in the East District by the league. That Guardian was also a member of the Cape family.</p>
<p>Although there were rumors in the outside world that Ming Xiu had once killed a Terror-grade dimensional creature, no one had seen it with their own eyes. The League of Guardians had also analyzed Ming Xiu, believing that he was still at the Mythical stage and hadn’t advanced to the Terror grade. The rumors of him killing a Terror creature previously weren’t credible.</p>
<p>When Buzz saw Ming Xiu come out, his eyes lit up.</p>
<p>If he could defeat Ming Xiu, not only would he be able to avenge the Cape family, but his name would also resound across the Federation.</p>
<p>This was because in the battle when Zhou Wen was conferred the title of sovereign, humans were totally against Guardians. Even if they could accept a half-human like Ya, even if they were willing to treat the mutated humans who used the Mythical Serum as a part of humanity, they were unwilling to accept pure humans who contracted Guardians.</p>
<p>This made humans very resistant towards the League of Guardians. It also infuriated the humans who had contracted Guardians.</p>
<p>They had clearly obtained powerful strength, but they were unable to obtain the recognition of their fellow species.</p>
<p>For a human like Ming Xiu who used Mythical Serum, the fame and anticipation he obtained were things that a contractor like Buzz couldn’t enjoy.</p>
<p>Even within the Cape family, these youths from the Royal Academy were more willing to worship Ming Xiu than Buzz and his Guardian.</p>
<p>Furthermore, people would only mention Judge when talking about him. Ordinary people couldn’t even remember Buzz’s name.</p>
<p>Buzz looked forward to the reaction of those who idolized Ming Xiu after he defeated him.</p>
<p>Ever since Ming Xiu accepted Royal College’s invitation, Buzz had been looking forward to it. He had already asked a professional analyst in the League of Guardians to help him do the analysis. His ability had a certain restraining effect on Ming Xiu. As long as Ming Xiu didn’t advance to the Terror grade, his chances of winning were more than 70%.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu’s Tomorrow Sword Art gave people the illusion that they could block his sword, but if they really blocked it, they would realize that the strike came later than they imagined.</p>
<p>The Sword of Judgment could slice through illusions and aim right at the core. Even if Buzz made a mistake, the Sword of Judgment could accurately block Ming Xiu’s sword. Therefore, Ming Xiu was at an absolute disadvantage against him.</p>
<p>“The Royal College’s arena should be able to allow us to fight with our full strength,” Buzz said as he looked at Ming Xiu.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. Let’s do it here.” Ming Xiu reached out to grab his hilt.</p>
<p>“Here?” Buzz frowned slightly. This was the lounge. There were students and tutors nearby. With their strength, fighting here would probably affect many people.</p>
<p>After all, the Royal College was the Cape family’s school. Buzz was also a member of the Cape family, so he naturally had his reservations. He thought that Ming Xiu wanted to use this to threaten him.</p>
<p>“Yes, right here,” Ming Xiu said as he drew his sword.</p>
<p>The moment the sword was unsheathed, Buzz’s pupils constricted. He still wanted to retreat, but he only took half a step before stopping.</p>
<p>As for Ming Xiu, he had already sheathed his sword. He turned around, pushed open the door, and entered the lounge behind him.</p>
<p>Only when Ming Xiu turned around and pushed open the door did the students and tutors not far away see the sword flash, piercing through Buzz’s abdomen.</p>
<p>Only then did the wound on the standing Buzz’s abdomen split open. Blood immediately gushed out. He hurriedly covered the wound with his hand as his face turned pale. Without a word, he turned around and left. He had to immediately treat his injuries or he would die there and then.</p>
<p>The students watched in a daze as Buzz retreated in a sorry state. When they looked at Ming Xiu again, they realized that he had already entered the lounge and could only see the tightly shut door.</p>
<p>“The sword kills before the flash is seen. This sword is just too fast.”</p>
<p>“Swordsman Tomorrow lives up to his reputation.”</p>
<p>“Judge can be considered a famous Guardian. He actually lost in one strike. It’s too terrifying.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Coach, sorry to have kept you waiting,” Ming Xiu said apologetically when he returned to the lounge.</p>
<p>“Your Tomorrow Sword Art can be considered as having achieved some level of mastery,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>If anyone else said such words, they would only be considered arrogant. However, when Zhou Wen said it, Ming Xiu’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>“Coach, can you teach me how to proceed in the future?” Ming Xiu asked sincerely.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could say a word, Tsukuyomi suddenly said, “There are plenty of tomorrows, each one coming after the other that tomorrow never comes. When actually is your tomorrow?”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>When Ming Xiu heard that, he was stunned. His eyes stared straight ahead, but he wasn’t looking at anything. He stood there motionless as though he had lost his focus.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1149'>Chapter 1149: Hermit</h3>
<p>In the medical room of the Cape family, a man stood in front of the bed. His palm emitted a faint glow as he pressed it above the wound on Buzz’s abdomen.</p>
<p>Buzz’s wound healed at a speed visible to the naked eye. Not only was it a physical wound, but even the wound on the Guardian armor rapidly healed. Soon, the wound completely vanished.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, I’m incompetent. I’m sorry to trouble you to personally treat me.” Buzz stood up and bowed.</p>
<p>The man retracted his palm and said indifferently, “It’s not your fault. Ming Xiu’s sword art has indeed reached an extremely high level. Among Mythical creatures, there aren’t many who can withstand a single strike from him. This matter ends here. What happens in the future has nothing to do with you or the Cape family. Just do your job well.”</p>
<p>“Your Excellency… Are you going to do it yourself?” Buzz’s body trembled as he hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>He knew very well how terrifying this person was. Among the four heads of the League of Guardians, although Hermit’s reputation wasn’t as great as Cave Era and Blood Shaman, anyone who knew him knew that this person might be even more terrifying than the former two.</p>
<p>“Just do your job well,” Hermit said.</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Excellency.” Buzz hurriedly bowed his head in agreement.</p>
<p>After speaking to Hermit, he happened to meet Beryl, who had come to visit him. Beryl gave Hermit a curious glance when Buzz hurriedly pulled her aside and introduced her to him. “Your Excellency, this is my niece, Beryl.”</p>
<p>Hermit nodded slightly and left the hospital without looking at Beryl.</p>
<p>“Uncle Buzz, who is that person? You appear to be afraid of him?” Beryl asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Child, don’t ask. Why are you here?” Buzz hurriedly stopped before looking in the direction Hermit had left. He heaved a sigh of relief when he realized that Hermit was gone.</p>
<p>“Uncle Buzz, you are really heartless. I came to see you out of kindness, but you are giving me such an attitude,” Beryl said angrily.</p>
<p>“Alright, I surrender. I’m fine. I won’t die. Don’t worry,” Buzz said dotingly.</p>
<p>“That Ming Xiu is really detestable. To think that I used to worship him so much. He actually wanted to kill you. Thankfully, you’re fine,” Beryl said.</p>
<p>Buzz shook his head and said, “He didn’t try to kill me with that strike. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be my abdomen that was injured.”</p>
<p>“I see. In that case, he’s not too bad.” Beryl looked in the direction where Hermit had left. Seeing that there was no one there, she whispered, “Uncle Buzz, is that person from the League of Guardians? Seeing how afraid you are of him, he must be a high-ranking member of the League of Guardians, right?”</p>
<p>“I told you not to ask. In the future, you can’t mention anything about the League of Guardians. Got it?” Buzz repeatedly exhorted Beryl.</p>
<p>Although Beryl agreed, she had something on her mind.</p>
<p>After leaving the hospital, Beryl found an excuse to return to school and ran straight for the lounge where Zhou Wen and company were.</p>
<p>The seated Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi were chatting in the lounge while Ming Xiu stood there motionless for quite some time.</p>
<p>Due to Tsukuyomi’s words, Ming Xiu seemed to have had an epiphany. The strength in his body was undergoing a tumultuous change.</p>
<p>This was an extremely dangerous moment, so Zhou Wen had no choice but to guard him and not let anyone disturb him.</p>
<p>Just as he was chatting with Tsukuyomi, Zhou Wen suddenly sensed someone walking towards the lounge. Furthermore, the footsteps were rushed. He used Truth Listener to carefully scan the area and realized that the person was the girl they had met a few times on campus.</p>
<p>“Professor Ming, are you there?” Beryl came to the door and knocked anxiously.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen opened the door and asked.</p>
<p>“Leave quickly. The people from the League of Guardians want to kill Professor Ming,” Beryl immediately whispered when she saw Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Weren’t they here earlier?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Uncle Buzz only wanted to defeat Professor Ming. He definitely didn’t have the intention to kill anyone. However, the upper echelons of the League of Guardians are different. They want Professor Ming’s life. It’s best you leave quickly and quietly. Don’t let anyone discover you. I think he will take into account our Cape family and won’t attack you on campus. You have to be careful once you leave…” Before Beryl could finish her sentence, she was interrupted by an abrupt voice.</p>
<p>“Why would I take into account the Cape family?” Hermit’s voice made Beryl shiver. She turned her head and saw a familiar figure walking down the long corridor.</p>
<p>He was wearing something like a cloak. Although it didn’t completely cover his face, his face remained indiscernible.</p>
<p>Hermit walked over. His speed wasn’t fast, but his gait seemed to have a unique rhythm. Every step seemed to be in cadence with the beating of one’s heart, making them feel flustered as their heart raced.</p>
<p>Beryl took two steps back in fright as Zhou Wen pressed down on her shoulder and pulled her behind him.</p>
<p>“I’ve never met you before. What’s your name?” Zhou Wen asked when he found the person unfamiliar. He definitely hadn’t seen him before.</p>
<p>“The moment I contracted with the Guardian, my name became meaningless. The Guardian’s name is my name. You can call me Hermit,” Hermit said as he walked.</p>
<p>“Hermit… He’s one of the four Heavenly Kings of the League of Guardians…” Beryl exclaimed softly as her face turned pale.</p>
<p>There were more than four Terror-grade existences in the League of Guardians, but the four Heavenly Kings were the most terrifying. Even the members of the six families felt fear just from the mention of their names.</p>
<p>Beryl finally knew why Buzz had forbidden her from asking. With this person around, even if the head of the Cape family personally came, he probably wouldn’t be able to stop him from killing.</p>
<p>“You aren’t his match. Run…” Beryl turned around to urge Ming Xiu to escape, but she saw Ming Xiu standing there motionless as though he hadn’t heard her.</p>
<p>Beryl wanted to walk over, but she was stopped by Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>“He can’t move now unless you want him to die,” Tsukuyomi said indifferently.</p>
<p>Beryl was immediately stunned. She carefully observed Ming Xiu and realized that something was amiss with him.</p>
<p>“Could he be breaking through?” Beryl said with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Tsukuyomi answered affirmatively.</p>
<p>“What should we do? Why does it have to be at this time?” Beryl was anxious and at a loss.</p>
<p>“We’ll leave after he breaks through,” Tsukuyomi said.</p>
<p>“How can we wait until then?” Beryl didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. If they could wait, she wouldn’t be reeling with anxiety.</p>
<p>They could wait, but Hermit wouldn’t.</p>
<p>Beryl turned to look outside. To her surprise, Hermit had stopped outside the door and didn’t rush in.</p>
<p>“Hermit? I’ve never heard of you. What are you doing here?” When Beryl heard Zhou Wen’s words, she nearly fainted.</p>
<p>To her, provoking Hermit in such a manner was equivalent to him hanging himself in front of Death.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1150'>Chapter 1150: Ming Xiu’s Coach</h3>
<p>Hermit sized up Zhou Wen with a frown. The more he looked at Zhou Wen, the more familiar he found him. It was as though he had seen him somewhere before.</p>
<p>However, if it was someone he had seen before, Hermit was very confident that his memory wouldn’t forget him.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to be able to be so calm and composed in front of him wasn’t something an ordinary person could do. After all, his entire body’s pulse resonated with the heavens and the earth. It was impossible for an ordinary person to face him so easily.</p>
<p>It was even more impossible to forget such a person.</p>
<p>This couldn’t be blamed on Hermit not recognizing Zhou Wen. It was because the person impersonating Zhou Wen had slowly changed his temperament, appearance, and figure over the past five years.</p>
<p>As it was a subtle change accumulated over time, with slight adjustments each time, it made people slowly begin to recognize that that was how Zhou Wen ought to be.</p>
<p>Now that the real Zhou Wen had appeared, coupled with the changes in his appearance and temperament over the past five years, it was difficult for others to associate him with ‘Zhou Wen’ unless they were very familiar with him.</p>
<p>Hermit had only seen Zhou Wen’s pictures and videos in the past. To be able to sense that he was familiar was already testament to his acumen.</p>
<p>Hermit couldn’t tell Zhou Wen’s origins, nor could he tell from his clothes and the things on him. Therefore, he asked, “How may I address you?”</p>
<p>“My name isn’t important. What’s important is who I am,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Hermit was very patient as he asked again.</p>
<p>“I’m Ming Xiu’s coach,” Zhou Wen answered seriously.</p>
<p>“So what?” Hermit stared at Zhou Wen and pressed his middle finger on his thumb. Strength secretly gathered between his two fingers.</p>
<p>“So if you are here for Ming Xiu, you can return now,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Beryl wrote Zhou Wen off as crazy when she heard that. His tone made it seem as though he didn’t think much of Hermit. It was as though as long as he was around, Hermit couldn’t harm Ming Xiu at all.</p>
<p>Hermit’s gaze turned sharp as he stared coldly at Zhou Wen and said, “It’s fine if you want me to return, but it depends on whether you are capable of enforcing that.”</p>
<p>With that said, the fingers in Hermit’s sleeve moved.</p>
<p>After all, he was one of the four heads of the League of Guardians. If he was scared off by a few words from the other party, how could he still have a foothold in the League of Guardians?</p>
<p>However, Hermit didn’t plan on fighting Zhou Wen head-on. In fact, that wasn’t his specialty.</p>
<p>As Hermit flicked his finger, an invisible particle flew towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Hermit was best at micro powers. In this era, many people pursued greater and stronger things. Giant monsters that resembled dragons received the attention of most people. They yearned to possess such powerful strength.</p>
<p>However, it was different for Hermit. Although he also pursued becoming stronger, his pursuit was towards miniaturization.</p>
<p>“What determines strength and weakness are often trivial things.” This had always been Hermit’s belief. In fact, he had never been wrong.</p>
<p>Relying on his micro powers, Hermit had defeated many powerful opponents. Some of his opponents’ strengths were not inferior to his, but even if their strengths were comparable, his micro powers gave him a huge advantage.</p>
<p>A power that was so tiny that it was invisible to the Terror grade could erupt with terrifying power once it entered a body. It was impossible to guard against.</p>
<p>This micro crystal was so small that it was at the nanometer scale. Even Terror-grade creatures might not be able to see its existence because it was just too small.</p>
<p>However, such a tiny micro crystal didn’t even need to enter his body. All it needed to do was approach Zhou Wen and the power that erupted would be enough to severely injure a Terror-grade creature.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was casually standing in front of the door, he had engraved his Life Wheel with the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, Great Brahma, and Godfiend Era. He just didn’t project them into existence.</p>
<p>The enhancement that Great Brahma gave Zhou Wen was enough for him to see a matter at the quark scale. Although Hermit’s micro crystal was tiny, it couldn’t escape Zhou Wen’s senses.</p>
<p>The micro crystal flew towards Zhou Wen’s mouth, and just as it was about to enter his mouth to blast open his head…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t move despite the micro crystal reaching his lips. Hermit didn’t feel any joy. Instead, he felt a little uneasy.</p>
<p>In the next moment, Zhou Wen opened his mouth as a clown face appeared over his face. With a strange smile, he swallowed the micro crystal.</p>
<p>The unease in Hermit’s heart intensified as he retreated at full speed, but it was still too late.</p>
<p>The micro crystal that had been devoured by Clown Mask strangely appeared behind him. As he retreated, he immediately slammed into the micro crystal, causing it to explode.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>One of Hermit’s arms was blasted into a bloody mist. This was still under Hermit’s extremely fast reaction and control of the micro crystal. Otherwise, his entire body would have been blown to smithereens.</p>
<p>Hermit held his bleeding arm and didn’t say a word. He turned around and attempted to escape.</p>
<p>“If you have a death wish, continue fleeing,” Zhou Wen said casually without any intention of chasing after Hermit.</p>
<p>However, Hermit didn’t escape. He stopped in his tracks and didn’t dare take another step.</p>
<p>“Whose order was it to kill Ming Xiu?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“There wasn’t an order. Ming Xiu is an enemy of the League of Guardians to begin with. There’s no need for an order,” Hermit said.</p>
<p>“Does that mean you want to kill Ming Xiu?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“You could say that,” Hermit said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“Then stay here and guard Ming Xiu. If Ming Xiu lives, you live. If Ming Xiu dies, you die too. This shall continue until Ming Xiu gives you permission to leave.” Zhou Wen turned around and returned to the lounge.</p>
<p>Beryl watched Zhou Wen walk back in a daze as though she had seen a ghost. She couldn’t help but take two steps back as she felt horror.</p>
<p>She even saw the single-armed Hermit standing outside the door. He really didn’t leave—he just stood guarding the door.</p>
<p>“You… Who are you?” Beryl looked at Zhou Wen in surprise and finally couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>She didn’t even see Zhou Wen take action. It was as though Zhou Wen had just stood there and exchanged a few words with Hermit when one of Hermit’s arms suddenly exploded.</p>
<p>Then, because of one sentence from Zhou Wen, Hermit, one of the Four Heavenly Kings of the League of Guardians, actually stood at the door as a guard. This made her feel like she was living in a dream.</p>
<p>“Ming Xiu’s coach.” Zhou Wen didn’t wish to say his name because there was still another Zhou Wen in the An family.</p>
<p>“You… You…” Beryl repeated ‘you’ for a long time, but she couldn’t think of anything to say. Or perhaps she wanted to ask too many questions that she didn’t know where to start.</p>
<p>She suddenly recalled that Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi had claimed that Ming Xiu’s sword art was very ordinary. Back then, Beryl had thought that they were jealous of Ming Xiu, but now, she suddenly realized that they were speaking the truth.</p>
<p>Who is he? Is there such a powerful existence among humans? I don’t think I saw him use a Guardian, nor did I see any signs of dimensional creatures on him. Could he be a pure-blooded human? Impossible. It’s impossible for him to be a pure-blooded human. He must have hidden it well and fused with a Guardian or dimensional creature. I just can’t tell… Beryl looked at Zhou Wen and then at Hermit standing outside the door. Everything was so surreal.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1151'>Chapter 1151: Combination Ability</h3>
<p>Hermit’s injured arm didn’t recover the entire time. In fact, Hermit was good at healing. He was the one who had previously treated Buzz’s injuries.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, his injuries had yet to recover. Although the bleeding from his severed arm wasn’t fast, the drops of blood slowly dripped to the ground. Clearly, it hadn’t healed.</p>
<p>Hermit felt as though a strange force was constantly corroding his wound, preventing it from healing itself. He didn’t dare escape because of the existence of this power.</p>
<p>Hermit had a vague feeling that the force was like a time bomb that could explode at any moment.</p>
<p>Although few people had seen Hermit’s true appearance, a person with a severed arm standing at the door of the lounge and bleeding profusely attracted the attention of many students. The news quickly reached the Cape family.</p>
<p>Buzz’s heart skipped a beat when he heard that and his expression changed drastically. He hurriedly rushed to school.</p>
<p>He didn’t dare go to the lounge directly. Instead, he checked the situation through the surveillance cameras and watched the previous surveillance footage.</p>
<p>After he had seen everything, the shock in his heart was unimaginable.</p>
<p>Ordinary students didn’t know who Hermit was or what kind of existence he was, but Buzz knew very well.</p>
<p>Despite being the powerful and terrifying Hermit, the young man didn’t even move his hand. Just by looking at Hermit, he had blasted off one of Hermit’s arms, forcing him to obediently stand at the door as a guard. What terrifying strength was this?</p>
<p>Due to Clown Mask being at the Terror grade, ordinary humans couldn’t see it, much less the recording. Therefore, Buzz didn’t see Clown Mask appear. All he saw was Hermit’s arm suddenly explode for no reason.</p>
<p>Who is he? Ming Xiu actually has such a teacher? It’s no wonder he could rapidly rise in just a few years. Who is this person? He definitely didn’t contract a Guardian. He doesn’t look like he has fused with a Guardian or dimensional creature… The more Buzz observed the situation, the more alarmed he became.</p>
<p>After the observation, the clothes on Buzz’s back were drenched. He was already somewhat glad that Ming Xiu had injured him and not the other way around.</p>
<p>If he had angered such an existence, he didn’t know what the outcome would have been. Just the thought of a person that even Hermit didn’t dare disobey was terrifying.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Beryl has hit it off with that person. He shouldn’t make things difficult for our Cape family, right? Buzz didn’t dare be negligent. He immediately got someone to seal the area near the lounge, preventing students and teachers from going there.</p>
<p>Of course, he stayed far away and pretended not to know anything.</p>
<p>Beryl stood in the lounge, feeling uneasy. She couldn’t sit or stand. Her palms were sweaty from nervousness.</p>
<p>In her eyes, Ming Xiu was already an extremely powerful existence. Hermit was an extremely terrifying expert, but in front of this young man who looked to be in his twenties, they didn’t seem as grandiose as she imagined.</p>
<p>So Professor Ming actually has such a powerful coach. It’s no wonder he’s so strong. However, this person doesn’t look much older than Professor Ming. Could it be that he’s actually an old monster that’s over a hundred years old despite looking young? That’s right. That must be it. Beryl thought to herself.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored Beryl as he studied his Essence Energy Art.</p>
<p>Previously, he had circulated the Small Perfection of Wisdom, Godfiend Era, and Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder at the same time. The Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder had always taken on a supportive role, so there weren’t many changes.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen used Great Brahma and Clown Mask at the same time, there was an unexpected change.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept using Great Brahma to lock onto the micro crystal. At the same time, he used Clown Mask’s spatial teleportation ability to teleport the micro crystal behind Hermit.</p>
<p>The powers of Great Brahma and Clown Mask acted on the micro crystal at the same time, producing a special effect. Even Zhou Wen never expected the two powers to combine.</p>
<p>After Clown Mask’s spatial ability combined with Great Brahma’s karmic sinflames, it formed a spatial coordinate on the injured Hermit’s arm wound. Zhou Wen could directly teleport his powers there without any intermediate processes.</p>
<p>However, the only power that could teleport there was Brahma’s karmic sinflames—nothing else.</p>
<p>Even so, it was already extremely useful. As long as he was hit by Zhou Wen’s strike and his coordinates marked, the subsequent karmic sinflames could be acted on his wounds until he died.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was experimenting to see if there was any possibility of further fusion between Clown Mask and Great Brahma. If they could cooperate further, they might be able to produce even more terrifying powers.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, Ming Xiu’s body suddenly emitted a powerful sword intent fluctuation. Furthermore, his body began to undergo a strange transformation.</p>
<p>His skin, that was originally like milky-white jade, became even more crystalline. A strange energy fluctuation gradually spread from his body.</p>
<p>Slowly, Ming Xiu’s body became more and more transparent before disappearing from sight. The sword intent also vanished.</p>
<p>Eh! Zhou Wen looked in surprise at the spot where Ming Xiu had vanished.</p>
<p>He could sense that Ming Xiu had reached the stage of Terror transformation, but even so, Zhou Wen should have been able to see him with his Wheel of Destiny activated.</p>
<p>Strangely, Zhou Wen couldn’t see Ming Xiu. He seemed to have really vanished.</p>
<p>However, Ming Xiu soon appeared in his vision again. At that moment, Ming Xiu had returned to his normal human form. He was even more normal than before.</p>
<p>“Coach, this is your wife, right? Ma’am is really amazing. She really enlightened me with one sentence. I finally understood the profundity of time and completely absorbed the Mythical Serum. If it wasn’t for her, I don’t know when I would have been able to completely absorb it. Coach is indeed a coach. Not only is he strong himself, but even his wife is so strong…” Ming Xiu said excitedly.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to explain, Tsukuyomi smiled and handed a sword to Ming Xiu. “Take this as a gift from me then.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Ma’am.” Ming Xiu happily received the sword. He didn’t really think that the sword was good, but he was just happy.</p>
<p>However, when he truly experienced the power of the sword in the future, he would realize how precious it was.</p>
<p>“Ming Xiu, you have to thank this student. She took a huge risk to inform you.” Zhou Wen hurriedly changed the topic, unwilling to harp on this matter.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu looked at Beryl in puzzlement, unsure what had happened.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen recounted what had happened. After Ming Xiu heard that, he thanked Beryl.</p>
<p>As for Hermit, Ming Xiu didn’t do anything to him. Instead, after getting Zhou Wen’s permission, he released him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could roughly guess what Ming Xiu was thinking, so he didn’t ask further. However, after seeing Ming Xiu, he missed his friends and family even more.</p>
<p>Looking at Tsukuyomi, Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and decided to take her back to Luoyang.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1152'>Chapter 1152: Divorce Is Very Common Nowadays</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>In the An family in Luoyang, a guard reported to An Tianzuo in the study. “Overseer, Miss Ya’er has been cooped up in her room the entire day. She is not responding to Nanny Yu at all. Madam isn’t home, so Nanny Yu is afraid something will happen. Overseer, she would like to consult you on what to do?”</p>
<p>“Why isn’t she eating again? Didn’t I tell you that she likes desserts?” An Tianzuo said as he got up.</p>
<p>“Nanny Yu said that she bought all the best desserts in Luoyang and even hired the best dessert chefs. However, Miss Ya’er won’t eat anything. She didn’t eat anything last night either, much less come out today,” the guard said.</p>
<p>“She hasn’t eaten anything since last night. How can she…” As An Tianzuo spoke, he walked out of the study and quickly walked towards Ya’er’s yard.</p>
<p>“Ya’er, why didn’t you eat today? Is the food at home not to your liking? Shall I take you out to eat?” An Tianzuo knocked on the door and said gently.</p>
<p>“I’m not hungry. I don’t want to eat.” The door creaked open and a girl about seven or eight years old walked out. She was as beautiful as a doll, but her expression was cold. It didn’t look like an expression a girl her age should have.</p>
<p>“You have to eat a little even if you don’t want to. You are still growing, so you have to eat more. If you are sick of Luoyang’s desserts, I’ll invite the famous dessert masters from the south over. They will make desserts that will be more delicious…” An Tianzuo said with a smile.</p>
<p>Ya’er shook her head. “Uncle, I’m really not hungry. I don’t want to eat.”</p>
<p>“How can you not be hungry? Wait in the living room. Uncle will personally cook something delicious for you. My signature dish. I guarantee you that you will like it,” An Tianzuo said as he headed for the kitchen.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Ya’er sat on the sofa in the living room and held her chin in boredom.</p>
<p>Although the An family’s life was very comfortable and everyone treated her well, she still liked the life of adventuring with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a figure flashed and two figures appeared in the living room. They were Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen really couldn’t shake off Tsukuyomi, but seeing that she wasn’t a dimensional creature that killed at will, after much hesitation, he took her back to Luoyang.</p>
<p>As he didn’t know why the An family had created a fake Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen didn’t directly walk through the main door. He decided to teleport to the spot where he had eaten with Ouyang Lan to see if he could bump into her.</p>
<p>After completing the teleport, he didn’t see Ouyang Lan. Instead, he saw Ya’er sitting on the sofa in a daze.</p>
<p>Although Ya’er was much older than before, he could still make out her former appearance. Furthermore, she had a unique aura that others couldn’t sense. Zhou Wen had spent a lot of time with Ya’er, so he was very familiar with her unique aura.</p>
<p>When Ya’er saw Zhou Wen, she was first taken aback before she jumped up from the sofa in pleasant surprise and threw herself into Zhou Wen’s arms.</p>
<p>“You said you would take care of me!” Ya’er said angrily before opening her mouth and biting Zhou Wen’s neck.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a pain in his neck, but he didn’t dodge. However, Ya’er didn’t really want to injure him. All she did was leave behind teeth mark without tearing his skin.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t what I wanted either, but I was locked up by someone else. I couldn’t come back to find you even if I wanted,” Zhou Wen explained.</p>
<p>“Who was it?” Ya’er bit her lip and asked.</p>
<p>“We’ll talk about that later.” Zhou Wen stroked Ya’er’s head. “You’ve grown taller and grown up. You’ve become even more beautiful and adorable.”</p>
<p>Ya’er narrowed her eyes like a kitten and leaned her hair on Zhou Wen’s hand. She rubbed it gently as though she enjoyed his touch.</p>
<p>“Ya’er, Uncle has made you…” An Tianzuo walked in with a bowl of piping hot glutinous rice balls. He was wearing a white shirt and military pants. He also wore an apron and was covered in flour. There was even a pinch of flour at the tip of his nose. He looked completely different from his usual dignified appearance.</p>
<p>However, when he saw Zhou Wen hugging Ya’er, the gentleness on his face immediately vanished as though he had instantly returned to the cold and arrogant Overseer An.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>However, he was wearing an apron and holding a bowl. His face was covered in flour, and his bearing was rather inferior to his usual self. He didn’t look as arrogant as he usually was.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen turn his head, An Tianzuo immediately pulled off his apron and threw it at the guard beside him. He placed the bowl of glutinous rice balls on the table beside him and wiped his face. His expression instantly turned arrogant and cold.</p>
<p>“When did you return?” An Tianzuo asked Zhou Wen coldly.</p>
<p>“Just,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo said coldly, “Since you’re back, stay at home for the next few days and don’t cause trouble.”</p>
<p>With that said, An Tianzuo glanced at Ya’er, who was in Zhou Wen’s arms with a smile on her face. He turned around and left. When he reached the door, he paused for a moment and said, “Ya’er hasn’t eaten much in the past two days. I’ve prepared a bowl of glutinous rice balls for her in the kitchen. Give it to her. To throw a child at home and be away for so long without returning. Aren’t you afraid the child will go bad?”</p>
<p>With that said, An Tianzuo walked out of the living room without looking back.</p>
<p>After leaving the living room, An Tianzuo instructed the guards beside him, “Give An Sheng a message. Tell him that the person is back.”</p>
<p>“Does the order need to be transmitted?” the guard asked.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. He knows what to do.” An Tianzuo took a few steps and seemed to recall something. He said to the guard beside him, “Go to the kitchen and get a cup of freshly squeezed orange juice for Ya’er. Heat it to 43 degrees.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Overseer.” The guard accepted the order and left.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sat on the sofa and watched Ya’er eat the glutinous rice balls. Having not seen her for five years, Ya’er’s language skills had improved significantly. Although she still didn’t like to speak, her occasional words weren’t as simple and stiff as before.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could also tell that Ya’er’s personality had become more cheerful. Clearly, the An family had taken good care of her in the past five years.</p>
<p>Ya’er had a good appetite perhaps due to Zhou Wen’s return. She quickly finished the bowl of glutinous rice balls and licked her lips as though she hadn’t had enough. She felt that the glutinous rice balls today were especially delicious.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen by her side, Ya’er didn’t wish to speak. As long as she was by Zhou Wen’s side, she felt at ease and didn’t need to say much.</p>
<p>However, Ya’er’s gaze at Tsukuyomi seemed to carry some hostility.</p>
<p>“She’s Tsukuyomi, my friend. This is Ya’er, who’s no different from my sister.” Zhou Wen hurriedly introduced the two of them to prevent any trouble.</p>
<p>“I’m not an ordinary friend. I’m Zhou Wen’s wife,” Tsukuyomi deliberately emphasized her identity as she said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Divorce is very common nowadays,” Ya’er said expressionlessly.</p>
<p>6</p>
<h3 id='chapter1153'>Chapter 1153: Battling the Planet Devourer Again</h3>
<p>Their gazes met in the air as though sparks were flying.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, you’re back.” An Sheng came in at the right time, interrupting Tsukuyomi and Ya’er’s staring showdown.</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng.” Zhou Wen was overjoyed. On the one hand, it was a long-awaited reunion, but on the other hand, he was grateful for An Sheng’s timely arrival. If they were to really fight, Zhou Wen was afraid that Luoyang would be reduced to ruins.</p>
<p>He got An Sheng to sit down and have a chat, but Zhou Wen didn’t ask about the fake Zhou Wen. An Sheng didn’t say anything about him either. All he did was talk about his family.</p>
<p>At night, just before Zhou Wen went to sleep, he found a bookshelf in his room. Zhou Wen pulled out a book to take a look. It recorded a lot of information that Zhou Wen wanted to know. An Sheng had secretly sent him a message about the book.</p>
<p>After some reading, Zhou Wen roughly knew why the An family had a fake Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen had been imprisoned, Wang Mingyuan secretly visited the An family and told them that Zhou Wen would go missing for five years. He got them to create a fake Zhou Wen in these five years to replace Zhou Wen. They were not to let others discover any flaws.</p>
<p>However, there were no records of the person impersonating Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>How did Teacher know that I would escape in five years? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled. This was because his awakening and escape seemed to be a coincidence, but the time was identical to Wang Mingyuan’s inference. This made Zhou Wen suspect if his escape was a coincidence.</p>
<p>However, Wang Mingyuan was now in the dimension, so his guesses were useless.</p>
<p>The book contained information on another thing that Zhou Wen wanted to know. Ouyang Lan had been investigating the former principal’s expedition team for the past five years.</p>
<p>She had made some discoveries some time ago and Ouyang Lan had already rushed to Netherworld City. She wanted to find Chu He, who was trapped there. She wanted to confirm some of her guesses.</p>
<p>If those guesses were confirmed, the disappearance of the expedition team was very likely related to the Trajectory Holy Temple of the six Holy Temples.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was shocked when he found out that Ouyang Lan had gone to Netherworld City.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that there were break-out dimensional creatures everywhere outside, Netherworld City itself was an extremely terrifying place. It wasn’t easy to enter and come out alive.</p>
<p>“I’ve told you about the situation in Netherworld City. You should know how dangerous it is. Why didn’t you stop Sis Lan?” Zhou Wen sent a message to An Sheng.</p>
<p>Soon, An Sheng replied: “You know Madam’s temper. Even Overseer couldn’t change her mind. However, you don’t have to worry too much. Overseer sent many experts from the Sunset Army to accompany her. If Netherworld City were to be explored, Madam wouldn’t be the one entering personally. With the information you gave, there shouldn’t be much danger.”</p>
<p>“I’m just afraid that the present Netherworld City is different from the past.” Zhou Wen knew that Netherworld City wasn’t simple. If he could suffer all the punishments, he would be able to see the real Netherworld City.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” An Sheng asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen told An Sheng what City Lord Netherworld had said. An Sheng heaved a sigh of relief when he heard that. “Don’t worry. No one among them can withstand all the punishments. Nothing will happen.”</p>
<p>An Sheng explained the current situation of the Federation to Zhou Wen. It was similar to what Zhou Wen had previously gathered. Earth could now be divided into five factions.</p>
<p>The Federation President and some of his supporters, the League of Guardians, the Holy Spirit Association, the overseas factions, and the local wealthy families like the An family.</p>
<p>There were also some powerful freelance hunters, among which some were very powerful existences. However, compared to these large factions, an individual’s strength was still relatively weak.</p>
<p>The six hero families didn’t decline, nor were they completely controlled by the League of Guardians. Their branches extended into the various factions. Even if one side collapsed, the six hero families wouldn’t be completely destroyed.</p>
<p>In fact, there were many members of the six families in the League of Guardians. Although the Zhang family nominally objected to their family members entering the League of Guardians, there were still some Zhang family members who joined the League of Guardians. No one knew if those people had really been expelled from the Zhang family.</p>
<p>“This is the foundation of a large family. As long as their model for survival isn’t destroyed, as long as the supply chain for resources persists, it doesn’t matter even if a few geniuses and powerhouses die. They have the ability to create more geniuses and powerhouses. All they need is time,” Ah Sheng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that Ah Sheng was right. The reason the six families were strong wasn’t because a particular genius was strong, but because they already had a complete model for the family’s survival. They could obtain endless resources and nurture all sorts of geniuses. To overthrow such a family, killing a few geniuses and powerhouses was useless. Unless the entire family was thrown into a situation of certain doom, they would eventually rise again.</p>
<p>Just like the Cape family, many geniuses had died because of Zhou Wen, but they remained standing.</p>
<p>According to An Sheng, the antelope and Chick were by the fake Zhou Wen’s side. Only by doing so could they fool the people who were paying attention to Zhou Wen. Therefore, they weren’t in the An family, but guarding Chess Mountain with the fake Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>After chatting with An Sheng, Zhou Wen took out his mysterious phone and entered the game again.</p>
<p>Snow Valley’s Gu Mother hadn’t respawned. Zhou Wen didn’t choose to head to the Sapphire Sky either. Instead, he chose to head to the Endless Sea of Stars dungeon to see if he could kill the Planet Devourer.</p>
<p>He also farmed the Constellation Sea, but he still failed to obtain the final twenty-eight Lunar Mansions skill.</p>
<p>After leaving the range of the Constellation Sea, Zhou Wen summoned Banana Fairy and Demonic Neonate. Not long after, he sensed spatial fluctuations as the gigantic Planet Devourer appeared above them.</p>
<p>The jellyfish-like Planet Devourer emitted intense starlight, but ordinary people couldn’t see it.</p>
<p>In its body, there was a vortex that resembled a black hole. Everything that approached it was sucked into the black hole.</p>
<p>The moment the Planet Devourer descended, the terrifying suction force descended.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy directly used the Supreme Yin Wind at the Planet Devourer. With the augmentation of Three Realms’ Best Wind, this surge was extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>However, when the Supreme Yin Wind reached the Planet Devourer, it was sucked in by the black hole in its body.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy fanned out Supreme Yang Wind next, but the outcome was the same. They were all sucked into the black hole.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy frowned slightly. The fan in her hand which was transformed from the banana leaf showed a half Yin and half Yang state. At the instant she fanned at the Planet Devourer, Yin and Yang combined into one, transforming into Boundless wind that swept towards the Planet Devourer.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1154'>Chapter 1154: Singularity Universe</h3>
<p>Boundless Wind swept toward the Planet Devourer, but it was unable to blow it away.</p>
<p>Its body was like a black hole. No matter what kind of force surged at it, it would be swallowed into the black hole. This had nothing to do with the strength of the force. This was the characteristic of the Planet Devourer.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a headache come on. A dimensional creature with a black hole body couldn’t be injured by typical forces. It would be useless no matter how powerful the attack was.</p>
<p>No wonder it can devour planets… Zhou Wen could only teleport with Banana Fairy to dodge the Planet Devourer’s suction as he pondered over a solution to kill it.</p>
<p>The Planet Devourer was also spatially powerful. It constantly teleported with Zhou Wen, hoping to devour him.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen, who was wearing Clown Mask, could teleport infinitely. The Planet Devourer couldn’t catch up to him.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen teleported to a tiny planet. After the Planet Devourer teleported over, it devoured the tiny planet. Zhou Wen took this opportunity to teleport to another tiny planet.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought that since the Planet Devourer was a dimensional creature, surely it couldn’t devour matter indefinitely. Therefore, if he could use these small planets to “feed” it, he might have a chance of finishing it off.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen soon realized that his idea was ridiculously wrong. After the Planet Devourer devoured the tiny planet, not only did it not show any signs of being ‘satiated,’ but the range and suction force of the black hole increased.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen realize that he was backwards in his thinking. The more matter the Planet Devourer devoured, the stronger it became. It didn’t seem like satiation was possible.</p>
<p>Since I can’t satiate it, I’ll starve it to death. With a thought, Zhou Wen teleported to a spot where there were fewer planets.</p>
<p>Teleportation required a large amount of Essence Energy. With the massive size of the Planet Devourer, the energy expended from teleportation was even more terrifying. After repeated teleportations, Zhou Wen could clearly sense that the Planet Devourer’s black hole had weakened significantly. The suction range and strength were shrinking.</p>
<p>It’s indeed effective! Zhou Wen was delighted as he continued wandering the Endless Sea of Stars with the Planet Devourer.</p>
<p>The Planet Devourer had expended quite a bit of energy. It suddenly stopped chasing after Zhou Wen and instead rushed towards a small, nearby planet. Clearly, it wanted to devour the small planet to replenish its energy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally couldn’t let it do as it wished. He teleported to the tiny planet. The Clown Mask on his face emitted a strange aura as the surrounding space distorted.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pressed his palm on the tiny planet, hoping to teleport it away.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he quickly realized that although the Clown Mask was powerful spatially, it was still too difficult to teleport a small planet far away.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could successfully teleport the tiny planet, the Planet Devourer had already devoured it. All Zhou Wen could do was teleport away.</p>
<p>It doesn’t seem realistic to forcefully teleport planets away, but what if I use the teleportation ability of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art? Zhou Wen didn’t give up on his plan as he thought of a way to achieve his goal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen circulated the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art and engraved it on the Wheel of Destiny. It was a point, the Universe’s singularity.</p>
<p>The singularity was the beginning of the universe, as well as the eternity of the universe. It looked like a point, but inside, it seemed to be a pocket universe with countless stars revolving.</p>
<p>Back when Zhou Wen condensed the Singularity Life Soul, he had already begun advancing to the Mythical stage. He hadn’t had much time to study the ability of this Life Soul then.</p>
<p>After being trapped for five years, his mind had experienced more than a hundred years. Over the long years, Zhou Wen had gained a deep understanding of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art and Singularity.</p>
<p>However, research was ultimately research. As he was trapped, he could only think about it without completing any verification. Therefore, Zhou Wen didn’t know if he was right.</p>
<p>Now, in the Endless Sea of Stars, Zhou Wen could test his ideas.</p>
<p>With the power of Singularity Universe, Zhou Wen could freely traverse the tiny planets in the Endless Sea of Stars. However, he could only locate the tiny planets. He couldn’t teleport easily like when he was using Clown Mask, but the teleportation distance was much further.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen landed on a tiny planet and attempted to use the power of Singularity Universe to teleport the tiny planet to another location.</p>
<p>However, the outcome wasn’t that instantaneous. Although the star corresponding to the tiny planet in the Singularity Universe kept flickering, there was no movement.</p>
<p>The Planet Devourer had already caught up to him. Zhou Wen had no choice but to give up on the idea of teleporting the planet. He teleported to another planet.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t totally give up. He continued trying again and again, believing that he would succeed.</p>
<p>Since this Essence Energy Art is called Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping, there’s no reason why it can’t shift a tiny planet… Sun-Swapping… Zhou Wen suddenly thought of something as his eyes lit up.</p>
<p>He tried again, but this time, he didn’t just want to teleport this small planet. He wanted to swap it with another small planet.</p>
<p>In the Singularity Universe, two stars lit up. As the hands Zhou Wen used to press down on the tiny planet produced spatial fluctuations, the entire planet seemed to be affected.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A powerful spatial energy fluctuation exploded from Singularity Universe, as though a universe had undergone a Big Bang. It instantly produced a strange pocket universe phantom that fused with Zhou Wen’s body, giving him a strange feeling that the universe was him and he was the universe.</p>
<p>In the next second, an unbelievable thing happened. Spatial energy suddenly erupted. Then, the tiny planet under Zhou Wen’s hands, with its main body composed of metal, instantly turned into a tiny stone planet. It was the one Zhou Wen had chosen to exchange with.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, it really works. Then can I exchange Earth with other planets in real life? Let Earth leave the Milky Way? Zhou Wen imagined himself traveling with Earth in the universe.</p>
<p>However, on careful thought, it probably wasn’t that easy.</p>
<p>When the Singularity Universe advanced to the Terror grade, it could only move such a tiny planet. The size of a small planet was about the size of a mountain. It was far inferior to Earth. It was probably not that easy to swap it with a real planet.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there were so many terrifying creatures and dimensional zones on Earth. It was impossible to teleport with so many terrifying things on it without expending energy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at the blood-colored avatar’s stats and realized that the Terror transformation condensed by the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art was called Singularity Universe. It was also an S-grade Terror transformation.</p>
<p>Up to now, Zhou Wen had already condensed four S-grade Terror forms of Great Brahma, Godfiend Era, Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, and Singularity Universe. However, his level was still at the Mythical stage, and his stats hadn’t exceeded 81.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1155'>Chapter 1155: Double Terror Strength</h3>
<p>The Singularity Universe’s Terror transformation allowed Zhou Wen to obtain one of the abilities of Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping, but this ability could only be used via an exchange. He couldn’t teleport the tiny planet away.</p>
<p>Sending one away and swapping to another planet that ended up being devoured by the Planet Devourer still allowed it to replenish its mass and be rejuvenated. This was clearly far from the outcome Zhou Wen wanted.</p>
<p>Is there no other way? Zhou Wen constantly gained insight into the power Singularity Universe gave him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping technique didn’t necessarily need a planet to be exchanged. He could exchange a planet with a paper ball. That was also possible.</p>
<p>However, with the current strength of Singularity Universe, he was still unable to achieve that. This was because the positioning was too vague. The smallest unit that the Singularity Universe could locate was a planet. It was impossible to locate a paper ball from afar, so there was naturally no way to do a swap.</p>
<p>Since I’m already at the Terror grade, shouldn’t the resolution be raised? Even if I can’t see a paper ball, I should still be able to locate a mountain or river! Zhou Wen felt somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>However, on second thought, Zhou Wen’s heart stirred again.</p>
<p>Just the Singularity Universe definitely couldn’t be that precise. After all, the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art was a rather macroscopic Essence Energy Art.</p>
<p>However, the power of the Godfiend Era was different. It was also spatial power, but the Godfiend Era was a spatial power with relatively high precision.</p>
<p>If I can use the power of Clown Mask and Singularity Universe at the same time like I can use Great Brahma and Clown Mask, what will the effects be? Will I be able to do some more precise location and exchange? With a thought, Zhou Wen circulated the two Terror form powers simultaneously.</p>
<p>Since he wasn’t afraid of death in-game, there was no harm trying.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen attempted to fuse the powers of the two Terror forms. The blood-colored avatar’s body split apart and vanished. The game screen turned black as a notification popped up: ‘Successful Suicide.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s face darkened as he thought to himself, How can this be considered suicide? I’m clearly donating my body for experimentation.</p>
<p>Although his attempt failed, Zhou Wen knew very well that this was only because he hadn’t grasped the rhythm of the two fused Terror form powers. It didn’t mean that they couldn’t fuse.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen began trying again, only to be notified that he had succeeded in his suicide.</p>
<p>Every death brought him some benefits. Zhou Wen knew that he wasn’t far from success.</p>
<p>If I can make all nine Essence Energy Arts reach the Terror form and use all nine Terror forms of power simultaneously, what will happen? Zhou Wen wondered at the back of his mind.</p>
<p>After practicing hard for most of the night, Zhou Wen finally succeeded in fusing the two Terror form powers into one for the first time. Then, he attempted to teleport a tiny planet out.</p>
<p>However, when he pressed his palm on the planet, a black hole appeared and swallowed the planet.</p>
<p>The black hole also began devouring everything around it, nearly sucking the blood-colored avatar in. Thankfully, Zhou Wen reacted quickly and teleported out.</p>
<p>This was completely different from what Zhou Wen had expected. Clearly, the fused spatial powers hadn’t developed in the direction Zhou Wen wanted. Instead, they had produced a black hole.</p>
<p>I wonder if I can deal with the Planet Devourer by pitting a black hole against a black hole? Just as Zhou Wen was thinking, he realized that the Planet Devourer had already descended on the small black hole he had created.</p>
<p>The Planet Devourer rushed towards the small black hole. After the two collided, not only did they not clash, but they fused into one, making the Planet Devourer even stronger.</p>
<p>That black hole betrayed me! Zhou Wen nearly spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>
<p>He knew that it was because his control of the fused Terror powers wasn’t good enough. Furthermore, using a black hole to resist another black hole wasn’t the right solution.</p>
<p>With no choice, Zhou Wen could only continue experimenting. Thankfully, he already had the experience of success, so everything went much smoother.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen quickly mastered the method to create a black hole. However, all the black holes he could create were miniature black holes. Furthermore, he needed enough external matter to support them.</p>
<p>Although this move was useless against the Planet Devourer, it was still very effective against other Terror creatures.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued his research. His main goal was to truly achieve sky-stealing and sun-swapping. He wanted to teleport the planet away without giving the Planet Devourer a chance to replenish its matter.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t able to complete his goal until morning, but he made some progress.</p>
<p>An Sheng sent a message early in the morning, telling Zhou Wen to temporarily stay in the An family residence and not go anywhere. Tonight, he could exchange identities with the fake Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Who’s that Zhou Wen?” Zhou Wen replied.</p>
<p>“Guess.” An Sheng replied.</p>
<p>“I’ve no idea.” Zhou Wen thought to himself, Guess my ass! How would I know who it is?</p>
<p>However, on second thought, it wasn’t easy to pretend to be him without revealing any flaws.</p>
<p>His signature Companion Beasts were unique. Furthermore, the person needed to have sufficient strength. Even with the chick and antelope as cover, it wouldn’t be easy to find such a person.</p>
<p>“It can’t be you, right?” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“No, it’d be too obvious if it was me. I’d definitely be seen through.” An Sheng debunked Zhou Wen’s guess.</p>
<p>“Who is it?” Zhou Wen really couldn’t figure it out. There were only a few experts in Luoyang. It was impossible for Leng Zongzheng and An Tianzuo to impersonate him. Zhou Wen really couldn’t guess who else had such abilities.</p>
<p>“You’ll know when the time comes.” An Sheng clearly liked this feeling and didn’t tell Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Since An Sheng didn’t say anything, Zhou Wen had no choice but to stop asking. After chatting with An Sheng for a while, An Sheng got busy with work.</p>
<p>Ya’er pushed open the door and walked in. She was holding a plate with breakfast on it. Furthermore, it looked like it was for two.</p>
<p>Ya’er placed the plate on the table and sat down opposite Zhou Wen. She blinked and said, “Breakfast, together.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hadn’t slept in the first place. He went to sit down and prepare to have breakfast with Ya’er, but to his surprise, Tsukuyomi walked in before he even sat down. She took Zhou Wen’s seat and took a bite of his breakfast. She looked at Ya’er and said with a smile, “Not bad. It’s pretty good. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to thank me. Anyway, I feed the dogs at home every day. I’m used to it.” Ya’er pushed the remaining portion of the plate to Tsukuyomi. “Eat more if you like it.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know why Tsukuyomi liked to be at odds with Ya’er, but when he saw that they were about to fight again, he hurriedly went over to pull Ya’er away. He coughed lightly and said to Tsukuyomi, “Don’t you want to see how humans learn? I’ll take you to the place I used to go to school, okay?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it just a place like the Royal College? It’s boring,” Tsukuyomi said.</p>
<p>“It’s different. The place I attended is rather interesting, but we can only go there later.” Zhou Wen wanted to meet his old classmates, but on careful thought, they had already graduated. Unless they had continued studying or become a tutor, it would be impossible for him to see them again.</p>
<p>I wonder how Gu Dian is now? Zhou Wen thought of the devil-like man.</p>
<p>He had already roughly learned about Li Xuan and company from An Sheng. Only Gu Dian had disappeared after graduation. It was unknown where he had gone.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1156'>Chapter 1156: Greetings Prince Consort</h3>
<p>At night, An Sheng came over to invite Zhou Wen and Ya’er to the meal held at the front hall.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi followed Zhou Wen the entire time, so he had no choice but to take her along.</p>
<p>Before the group reached the front hall, they saw a golden stream of light fly out and instantly appear in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his arm and saw a strange golden-feathered bird land on it. It was Chick.</p>
<p>However, Chick’s body now resembled a huge eagle. Its body was also very similar in shape, leaving Zhou Wen puzzled. He thought to himself, How strange. Isn’t it a descendant of a phoenix? Why does it look more and more like an eagle?</p>
<p>However, being able to reunite with Chick delighted Zhou Wen. He reached out to stroke Chick’s feathers and vaguely felt a heat flowing beneath them.</p>
<p>Chick intimately extended its head and rubbed against Zhou Wen’s body. It didn’t feel unfamiliar despite the five years of separation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen still didn’t understand why the phoenix had chosen him to deal with Chick.</p>
<p>After entering the front hall, Zhou Wen saw the antelope lazily sprawled on the sofa without approaching the dining table.</p>
<p>At the dining table, An Tianzuo sat at the main seat with An Jing sitting on his right.</p>
<p>Having not seen her for so many years, An Jing’s appearance was very different from before. She was now as tall as Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Without the baby fat on her face, she looked even more heroic. Furthermore, she looked much more composed. She sat with a straight back, a clear indication of a soldier’s bearing.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo and An Jing looked at Zhou Wen without a word.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, sit here.” An Sheng got Zhou Wen to sit on An Tianzuo’s left. Ya’er sat beside Zhou Wen. An Sheng had planned on arranging for Tsukuyomi to sit on An Jing’s side, but Tsukuyomi sat down beside Ya’er.</p>
<p>An Sheng had no choice but to walk to An Jing’s side and sit down. Then, he said to Zhou Wen, “Young Master Wen, why don’t you introduce this beautiful lady to us?”</p>
<p>“Her name is Tsukuyomi. She’s a friend I met overseas.” Zhou Wen found it odd because An Sheng had previously said that he should be able to see the person impersonating him tonight, but there was only An Tianzuo and An Jing here.</p>
<p>It’s definitely impossible for An Tianzuo. Could it be that the person impersonating me was An Jing? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but glance at An Jing.</p>
<p>An Jing happened to be looking at him as well. When their eyes met, the two of them subconsciously looked away, feeling uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Miss Tsukuyomi, are you from overseas? Which island do you live on?” An Tianzuo asked Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>“Bride Island,” Tsukuyomi answered truthfully.</p>
<p>“Bride Island?” An Tianzuo frowned slightly as he sized up Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>Clearly, he knew what kind of place Bride Island was and knew that it was impossible for humans to live there.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was afraid that An Tianzuo would continue asking, so he explained, “Bride Island isn’t as terrifying as the legends say. I’ve been there and seen the Ghost Parade…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s topic immediately piqued An Sheng’s interest. “I heard that the Ghost Parade disaster has appeared overseas. A Calamity creature should have appeared, but for some reason, there was no news all of a sudden. Young Master Wen, since you’ve been there, do you know what happened?”</p>
<p>An Jing and An Tianzuo also looked at Zhou Wen. Clearly, they also wanted to know the answer.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally knew what had happened, but he couldn’t tell them in front of Tsukuyomi that he had abducted the newly born Calamity creature, so the dimensional creatures that accompanied her had temporarily ended up settling down.</p>
<p>“Actually, it’s just a rumor. Calamity creatures aren’t as terrifying as the outside world described them to be. They are still very kind and reasonable. They are also very amiable. I reasoned with them, and they probably felt that what I said made sense, so they stopped their parade.” With Tsukuyomi beside him, he could only speak against his conscience.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if he angered Tsukuyomi, Luoyang would probably be doomed.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo, An Jing, and An Sheng looked at him. The look in their eyes said everything. They felt that Zhou Wen was spouting nonsense.</p>
<p>Reason with a Calamity creature? Very kind and amiable. It would be a miracle if they believed it.</p>
<p>An Jing said indifferently, “If they are so kind and nice, why didn’t you invite them back as guests?”</p>
<p>What do you mean by not inviting them? Isn’t one just beside me? Zhou Wen thought to himself, but he said, “It’s too far. The journey’s rough, so I’ll see if there’s a chance in the future.”</p>
<p>An Jing curled her lips and didn’t say anything else. Clearly, she felt that Zhou Wen was bullsh*tting.</p>
<p>An Sheng hurriedly tried to smooth things over. “Overseer, the food is ready. Why don’t we get them to serve the dishes now?”</p>
<p>An Tianzuo nodded slightly as An Sheng hurriedly instructed someone to serve the food.</p>
<p>It was a great spread, but it wasn’t extravagant. The most expensive food was probably the dessert that Ya’er ate. The rest were ordinary home-cooked dishes, but they were made exquisitely.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was especially tense as they ate together.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo ate a few mouthfuls, put down his bowl and chopsticks, and asked Tsukuyomi, “Miss Tsukuyomi, you live on Bride Island. Have you seen the Ghost Parade with your own eyes?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” Tsukuyomi answered.</p>
<p>“I wonder which are the hundred ghosts in the parade. Please broaden my horizons,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“Although the Ghost Parade is known as having a hundred ghosts, there are actually more than a hundred of them. Just at the Terror grade, there are already more than a hundred. For example, Great Daitengu, Yuki Onna, and Hashihime are all at the Terror grade,” Tsukuyomi answered.</p>
<p>“You are really lucky to escape alive with so many Terror creatures there.” An Jing clearly didn’t believe Tsukuyomi’s words.</p>
<p>“Didn’t Zhou Wen already say that the dimensional creatures there are very kind and amiable? We get along very well, like we’re friends. There’s no need to flee, right?” Tsukuyomi’s last sentence was directed at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Yes, they are especially friendly. They are really kind. We are all friends.” What else could Zhou Wen say? All he could do was echo Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>“Then you should invite them back next time. Let us meet these amiable friends,” An Jing said casually.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to wait. I can introduce you to them now,” Tsukuyomi said.</p>
<p>An Jing felt that there was no point in continuing. Just as she was about to end the topic, the lights in the hall suddenly went off.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the living room. The entire An family residence sank into darkness as all the lights were extinguished.</p>
<p>An Jing and An Sheng’s expressions changed. Just as they were about to get up, An Tianzuo said calmly, “Sit down.”</p>
<p>An Jing and An Sheng had no choice but to sit down again. However, just as they sat down, a cold wind blew open the door to the living room. Snowflakes swept in with the cold wind. At the same time, a woman in white floated in.</p>
<p>“Yuki Onna?” An Sheng and An Jing stared at Yuki Onna. They had already guessed her identity, but they still found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>Yuki Onna walked to Tsukuyomi’s side and bowed slightly at Tsukuyomi and Zhou Wen. “Your Majesty, Prince Consort. Greetings from your subject, Yuki Onna.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1157'>Chapter 1157: Tsukuyomi’s Performance</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>An Jing and company were dumbfounded. The entire An family residence was silent.</p>
<p>With the An family’s defense, with such a huge commotion, the troops and hidden forces should have long rushed into the hall, but there was no movement at all.</p>
<p>The dark yard was dead silent. The night was terrifyingly dark, as though a dark behemoth was entrenched in the An residence.</p>
<p>The sound of wings flapping was heard. Almost at the same time, Daitengu landed in the living room. It retracted its wings and bowed at Tsukuyomi and Zhou Wen. “Your Majesty, Prince Consort. Greetings from your subject, Daitengu.”</p>
<p>An Jing and company had naturally heard of the name ‘Daitengu.’ Legend had it that it was formed after an emperor died. It had a very high status in a particular country’s pantheon.</p>
<p>Is this really the legendary Daitengu? An Jing’s body trembled as she looked at the Daitengu that resembled a winged devil. It looked very similar to the legendary depiction.</p>
<p>Even if it wasn’t the legendary Daitengu, just its ability to appear out of thin air made it an extremely powerful existence. Without a doubt, it was at the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Before An Jing could figure out if it was really Daitengu, she suddenly heard a strange sound as though a behemoth had stepped into An Manor.</p>
<p>Soon, she saw a strange temple appear in front of the living room. The strange temple seemed to have a life of its own. Its open door was pitch-black like the mouth of a terrifying monster.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, Prince Consort. Greetings from your subject, Noderabō.” The temple rumbled as it landed in front of the hall. A ghastly voice sounded.</p>
<p>An ethereal sound of a stringed instrument came from the side door. Umibōzu carried his lute as he walked. After arriving in the hall, he bowed slightly at Tsukuyomi and Zhou Wen. “Your Majesty, Prince Consort. Greetings from your subject, Umibōzu.”</p>
<p>In a moment, four terrifying dimensional creatures appeared. Furthermore, there were layers of ghostly shadows in the distance, as though countless ghosts were heading their way.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>An Sheng and An Jing’s strength were extraordinary. They could sense that the strength of those creatures was extremely terrifying. They were definitely not ordinary Mythical creatures.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo didn’t look at Yuki Onna and company. He only stared coldly at Tsukuyomi. He had already guessed Tsukuyomi’s identity when Yuki Onna appeared.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, Tsukuyomi wasn’t a real human, but a Calamity creature that had appeared overseas. Only she could control so many terrifying creatures.</p>
<p>An Jing and An Sheng naturally thought the same. Their eyes were filled with horror as they looked at Tsukuyomi. No one expected the woman who had returned with Zhou Wen to be a Calamity creature that had appeared overseas.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me she wants to trigger the Ghost Parade in the An family? An Jing felt extremely uneasy.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>If it was really as Tsukuyomi had said, with more than a hundred Terror creatures gathered here, once violence erupted, the entire Luoyang City would probably suffer.</p>
<p>“Tsukuyomi, that’s enough. We are eating. Let them return,” Zhou Wen said with a frown.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>When Tsukuyomi heard Zhou Wen’s words, she was surprisingly gentle. She didn’t retort him and obediently waved her hand. Yuki Onna, Daitengu, and the other Terror creatures instantly retreated and vanished into the darkness. As for the An family, they returned to normal as the lights lit up again.</p>
<p>The guards outside didn’t seem to know what had happened. They were still patrolling as usual.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo’s brows relaxed when he saw that everyone was fine.</p>
<p>“Let’s sit down for the meal.” Zhou Wen secretly heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Tsukuyomi dismiss the dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>If they really came to blows, even if he could use the Immortal Culling Sword to kill Tsukuyomi, the An family and Luoyang would suffer heavy losses.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi seemed to have changed into a different person today. She was especially gentle and obedient as she picked up the bowl and chewed slowly. However, her present appearance was completely different from before in the eyes of An Jing and company.</p>
<p>A Calamity creature treated Zhou Wen’s words like an imperial edict. It was just too shocking.</p>
<p>Only each individual knew what they were feeling while having this meal.</p>
<p>“I’m full. I wish to get some rest.” Tsukuyomi looked at Zhou Wen as though she was asking for his opinion.</p>
<p>“Return first.” After Zhou Wen said that, Tsukuyomi got up and left.</p>
<p>After Tsukuyomi left, the atmosphere immediately relaxed. An Sheng whispered, “Young Master Wen, is she really the one who appeared overseas…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded and said helplessly, “Yes.”</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, pretty amazing. Even a Calamity-grade creature listens to you. Could it be that you’ve already advanced to the Calamity grade?” An Sheng asked.</p>
<p>Although An Sheng, An Tianzuo, and company knew that Zhou Wen was Human Sovereign, they could also tell that Zhou Wen had relied on the power of the sword to defeat Di Tian, not because Zhou Wen had advanced to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>An Jing and An Tianzuo also looked at Zhou Wen. They clearly wanted to know what level Zhou Wen had reached to make a Calamity-grade creature be so submissive.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi didn’t seem to go against Zhou Wen’s wishes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head and said with a bitter smile, “I’m still at the Mythical stage. I’m still very far from the Calamity grade. As for Tsukuyomi, I can’t explain it for the time being. It’s a long story.”</p>
<p>An Sheng naturally didn’t believe him. He said with a smile, “To be able to make a Calamity-grade creature listen to you, I also want to give such a long story a try.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t explain it clearly. No one would believe that a Calamity creature insisted on marrying him.</p>
<p>After the meal, Zhou Wen took Ya’er back.</p>
<p>Chick and antelope also followed, seemingly without much reluctance.</p>
<p>“Overseer, it looks like we don’t have to worry about Young Master Wen’s safety. Even a Calamity-grade creature acts so obedient towards him. Even if Young Master Wen hasn’t really advanced to the Calamity grade, he’s definitely much stronger than before. It won’t be easy for the League of Guardians to touch him,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Have we ever been worried about his safety?” An Tianzuo said indifferently, “Furthermore, just as he said, his strength hasn’t reached the Calamity grade. He hasn’t even reached the Terror grade. Tsukuyomi must have another reason for following him. It might not be a good thing.”</p>
<p>“Tsukuyomi doesn’t seem to have any ill intentions towards Young Master Wen,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Not having any ill intentions doesn’t mean anything. You still have to continue with the previous arrangements. It’s not time for wishful thinking,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“Overseer, don’t worry. I’ll do my best.” An Sheng stood up and saluted solemnly.</p>
<p>An Jing sat by the side and ate without saying a word. She originally imagined that she had grown a lot in the past five years, but now, she suddenly realized that her growth was nothing in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen returned to his room and realized that Tsukuyomi was waiting for him.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Zhou Wen return, Tsukuyomi blinked and asked, “How was my performance?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“My performance at the banquet, of course. Didn’t you humans say that a good wife has to give her husband face in front of outsiders? Was what I did considered giving you enough face? Was I considered a good wife?” Tsukuyomi asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>2</p>
<h3 id='chapter1158'>Chapter 1158: Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Skill</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately rendered speechless as he looked at Tsukuyomi, fully at a loss for words.</p>
<p>What kind of charm does the Heavenly Happiness Token have to make a Calamity-grade creature stoop to such a level? Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>Back when Emperor of Shang gave him the Heavenly Happiness Token, he didn’t think that there was any problem. Now, he realized how big a problem it was.</p>
<p>Emperor of Shang should have been the loser back then. Is the token he gave me really that powerful? After some thought, Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>“Is that wrong? I read about this on the Internet.” Seeing Zhou Wen remain silent, Tsukuyomi thought that she had done something wrong. She opened the webpage and saw that it had the words “Love’s Thirty-Six Stratagems.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing wrong. It’s written like this. Is there a problem with my usage?” Tsukuyomi studied it again.</p>
<p>Seeing that she had no intention of leaving, Zhou Wen had no choice but to give up his room to her and find another place to stay.</p>
<p>Chick and antelope returned to his side, making Zhou Wen feel indescribably at ease.</p>
<p>He summoned Banana Fairy, Demonic Neonate, Truth Listener, and the other Companion Beasts and allowed them to move freely in the room. Zhou Wen lay in bed and continued gaming. At the same time, he studied the combination of Clown Mask and Singularity Universe.</p>
<p>As he constantly failed, Zhou Wen became more and more adept at combining the two powers.</p>
<p>Finally, he thought of a way to move the tiny planet away without getting another planet in return.</p>
<p>When he arrived in front of a small planet again, Zhou Wen picked up a stone and pinched it before throwing it into the distance.</p>
<p>After the stone flew away, Zhou Wen pressed his palm on the tiny planet. In the next second, a strange thing happened. The tiny planet under Zhou Wen’s hand vanished as the stone he had thrown appeared in his hand.</p>
<p>I did it! Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he made a few more attempts. The success rate was rather high, and he could do the reverse as well.</p>
<p>However, he had to leave his coordinates on one of the objects before he could swap them from a distance.</p>
<p>The further the distance, the greater the expenditure.</p>
<p>To use this method, he had to use the power of Clown Mask and Singularity Universe at the same time. Neither one could be missing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen constantly practiced to allow himself to complete the swap at faster speeds. Only this way could he finish off the Planet Devourer.</p>
<p>After countless practice, when Zhou Wen felt that it was about time he found the Planet Devourer again.</p>
<p>He constantly used teleportation to expend the Planet Devourer’s powers. When the Planet Devourer’s black hole’s suction force was reduced to a certain extent, it attempted to devour the nearby tiny planets as expected.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately teleported to a tiny planet and teleported a stone out.</p>
<p>Just as the Planet Devourer was about to devour the tiny planet, it suddenly vanished. Zhou Wen also vanished with the tiny planet, leaving behind a fist-sized stone.</p>
<p>After the Planet Devourer devoured the stone, the replenishment it received was almost negligible.</p>
<p>The Planet Devourer quickly teleported to another tiny planet, planning to devour it again.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, Zhou Wen teleported over and appeared on the tiny planet. He teleported the tiny planet away again, leaving behind a stone.</p>
<p>A strange battle began. No matter which tiny planet the Planet Devourer appeared on, Zhou Wen would appear in time and swap the tiny planet away, leaving behind a fist-sized stone.</p>
<p>Without any replenishment, the black hole in the Planet Devourer’s body became weaker and weaker. Likewise for its suction force. Even its body gradually shrank.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expenditure was greater than that of the Planet Devourer, but with Slaughterer replenishing large amounts of Essence Energy and the augmentation of the Heaven-Opening Scripture’s Essence Energy recovery, it was almost equivalent to infinite Essence Energy.</p>
<p>The Planet Devourer’s body became smaller and smaller until it was about the size of a small planet. Then, its body suddenly collapsed and was destroyed.</p>
<p>Ding! A Companion Egg dropped from where the Planet Devourer had collapsed.</p>
<p>‘Killed Terror creature, Planet Devourer. Discovered Companion Egg.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted. This was the first Terror-grade Companion Egg that had dropped for him.</p>
<p>He reached out to grab the Companion Egg and saw that it was crystalline. There was a strange vortex pattern in it that seemed to be constantly swirling.</p>
<p>Planet Devourer: Terror</p>
<p>Life Providence: Black Hole</p>
<p>Life Soul: Star Core</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Devour</p>
<p>Terror Form: Devourer</p>
<p>Strength: 89</p>
<p>Speed: 92</p>
<p>Constitution: 94</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 93</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Spacetime Transfer, Energy Release.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Glove</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen saw the stats, he couldn’t help but be slightly taken aback. He never expected its companion form to be a glove. However, on careful thought, it did look a little like a glove, but it was just too big in size.</p>
<p>He directly chose to incubate it. A large amount of Essence Energy was sucked away by the Companion Egg. It was only with Zhou Wen’s double augmentation of Slaughterer and the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder that he could do so. Ordinary Mythical creatures couldn’t afford such enormous Essence Energy expenditure.</p>
<p>With the injection of Essence Energy, the Planet Devourer gradually hatched. It was identical to the Planet Devourer from before and was extremely large.</p>
<p>When the Planet Devourer was completely hatched, it transformed into a black beam that injected into Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen summoned it again, the Planet Devourer had already transformed into a glove. It was a black crystalline glove. In the palm was a mysterious black vortex that emitted a powerful suction force.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tested it and realized that he could control the suction force of the black hole in his palm. He attempted to use the Planet Devourer Glove on the nearby tiny planets.</p>
<p>The tiny planet that was the size of a mountain was pulled over by the black hole on the glove. The closer the tiny planet was to the black hole, the smaller it became. Finally, it was sucked into the black hole. Zhou Wen immediately felt that the power of the black hole had become much stronger after absorbing the tiny planet.</p>
<p>The Planet Devourer’s strength is sufficiently powerful, but the suction force of the black hole is a little too slow. Before sucking an object in, as long as one’s speed is fast enough, one can still dodge it. However, if I were to use the glove to strike the enemy, I would be able to suck the enemy into the black hole. It would be impossible for them to escape again. Zhou Wen thought about the ways to use Planet Devourer.</p>
<p>However, there was something that worried Zhou Wen. Planet Devourer’s black hole was somewhat similar to Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World. He didn’t know if he could retrieve the items that dropped if he sucked in the dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>He gave Planet Devourer a spin and indeed, as he had guessed, nothing would be left behind after being sucked into the black hole.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1159'>Chapter 1159: Alma Mater</h3>
<p>The next morning, An Sheng modified Zhou Wen’s appearance before letting him leave the An family.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the changes An Sheng had given him and realized that the contours on his face had softened. His hairstyle had also changed a little, but the other changes weren’t too big.</p>
<p>He took Ya’er and Tsukuyomi to Sunset College which was still considered Zhou Wen’s alma mater, even though he hadn’t graduated from there.</p>
<p>Luoyang was relatively intact because there were dimensional zones everywhere around it. Furthermore, there were several layers of dimensional zones below Luoyang City. The whole of Luoyang was equivalent to a massive and complicated dimensional zone. It was difficult for dimensional creatures from the outside world to rush in, so it had become abnormally safe.</p>
<p>As for the various dimensional zones in Luoyang, there were quite a number of dimensional creatures that had breached the restrictions. However, as people were already familiar with these dimensional creatures and with the constant battles over the past five years, they ultimately managed to preserve humanity’s foundation in Luoyang.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had also read quite a bit of information regarding Luoyang on the Internet. It could be said that Luoyang was a unique existence in the Federation.</p>
<p>Two of the four war gods of the new era were in Luoyang. One was An Tianzuo, and the other was Sunset College’s chancellor, Leng Zongzheng.</p>
<p>It was said that in the past five years, Luoyang had experienced countless break-out battles of all sizes. The biggest reason why humans could always entrench themselves was because of these two guards.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the familiar school entrance again, Zhou Wen felt mixed emotions. Although it had only been five years, the campus had undergone huge changes. Many buildings were new, and even the main entrance was different from before. It had probably been recently renovated.</p>
<p>Although the entire school looked brand new and looked even more grandiose than before, one could tell upon careful thought that the reason the school had undergone a large-scale renovation was definitely not because of aesthetic pursuits, but because it had to be rebuilt.</p>
<p>From this, it could be seen how many terrifying battles this school had experienced to make the entire school look almost brand new.</p>
<p>Just past the school entrance stood the statue of Human Sovereign with his heaven-defying strike. It was similar to the one Zhou Wen had seen before, but it looked even more majestic.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the Human Sovereign statue, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but shake his head and smile bitterly. Humans treated him as their savior and worshiped him like a god. However, he wasn’t thinking too much back then, nor was he thinking of saving humanity. He hadn’t had a choice.</p>
<p>Taking out the pass An Sheng gave him, he successfully took Tsukuyomi and Ya’er into the school.</p>
<p>It was obvious that the guards recognized him and were very respectful. Zhou Wen gathered that this respect was meant for the Zhou Wen, who was acted by An Jing, and not him.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, An Jing must have done quite a number of things while acting as me. Zhou Wen walked into the school and saw a very different scene from the Royal College.</p>
<p>Although this place placed great importance on the cultivation of Companion Beasts, Essence Energy Arts, and Essence Energy Skills, one could also see the shadow of technology. There were also many things that combined Companion Beasts and technology.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi was very curious when she saw the technological components.</p>
<p>“You’re right. The place where you attended school is indeed different from the school we went to previously,” Tsukuyomi said as she looked at the students practicing shooting on the field.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Although Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to admit it, he had to admit that it was mostly thanks to An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo always placed great importance on scientific research. Furthermore, Zhou Wen had heard that the effects were rather good. The Essence Energy compression accelerator he had created had played a vital role in the early battles during Luoyang’s defense.</p>
<p>However, due to the excessive expenditure of Essence Crystals, the Essence Energy compression accelerator was seldom seen in the subsequent battles.</p>
<p>As An Jing, who impersonated Zhou Wen, had been in the military all year round, ordinary students did not recognize Zhou Wen, only the soldiers who were deployed on campus did.</p>
<p>However, there were many legends about Zhou Wen on campus. He was considered a legend.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the training grounds, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but reminisce about the times he had practiced with Li Xuan, Feng Qiuyan, and company.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen circled the training grounds with Ya’er and Tsukuyomi. Just as he was about to leave, a student came in front of him and said politely, “Senior, can I help you?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at the student in front of him. He was about seventeen or eighteen years old, probably in his sophomore or junior year. Although he wasn’t as tall as Zhou Wen, he was still considered tall and handsome.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen knew that he had mistaken him for a graduate student, but Zhou Wen could indeed be considered his senior.</p>
<p>“Is this beautiful senior your girlfriend?” The student didn’t answer and instead asked while looking at Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>“No,” Zhou Wen said with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>“It’s fiancée,” Tsukuyomi added. This time, she didn’t say that she was Zhou Wen’s wife. Instead, she used the word fiancée. He did not know where she learned it from.</p>
<p>“Fiancée? That means you aren’t married?” The boy’s eyes lit up as he looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Senior, please fight me. If I win, can you agree to let me have dinner at the cafeteria with her?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at Tsukuyomi and saw that she wasn’t angry. Then, he looked at the boy and asked, “What’s your name?”</p>
<p>This boy was actually quite bold to have thoughts of chasing after a Calamity creature. It was unknown if he still had the guts to do so after knowing Tsukuyomi’s true identity.</p>
<p>“Qin Mu.” The boy’s tone was very calm, but from the way he raised his eyebrows, one could tell that he was proud of his name as though he was very famous.</p>
<p>In fact, many students on the training grounds were secretly discussing as they watched. Zhou Wen’s eyes and ears were extremely sensitive, so he quickly figured out Qin Mu’s origins.</p>
<p>Qin Mu was a sophomore, but his strength had already reached the peak of the Legendary stage. He was only half a step away from advancing to the Epic stage.</p>
<p>Although there were many dimensional creatures now, to have such achievements at such a young age made him an outstanding elite in Sunset College.</p>
<p>At this year’s school ranking, Qin Mu had only lost to the president of the student council and was ranked second. From this, one could tell how strong he was.</p>
<p>However, there was another reason why Qin Mu had such strength.</p>
<p>This was because Qin Mu was the younger brother of the famous female sword immortal in Luoyang. Although the female sword immortal’s fame wasn’t comparable to a figure like An Tianzuo, she was also a well-known figure in the Federation. She had never tasted defeat when it came to sword technique.</p>
<p>Speaking of sword techniques in the East District, the most outstanding ones were for males, Ming Xiu, and for females, this female sword immortal.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1160'>Chapter 1160: Female Sword Immortal’s Sword Art</h3>
<p>The female sword immortal’s name was Qin Zhen. Qin Mu’s relationship with Qin Zhen was very good, and he especially admired this sister. When he was at home, Qin Zhen was always the one who mentored him.</p>
<p>Of course, Qin Zhen’s teaching was only one aspect. Qin Mu himself was a bona fide genius, but he was a little too proud. Furthermore, his personality was more defiant and rebellious. He had caused a lot of trouble in school, giving his tutor a headache.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you want to fight me?” Zhou Wen asked Qin Mu.</p>
<p>“You don’t dare?” Qin Mu returned with a question.</p>
<p>“I do, but I just find it unfair.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said, “You can date her if you win, but I won’t get any benefits if I win. Do you think that’s fair?”</p>
<p>“Then if you win, I’ll arrange for my sister to date you. That’s fair, right?” Qin Mu said with a grin.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was glad that he hadn’t drunk any water. Otherwise, he might have spat it out. With a younger brother of this caliber, the female sword immortal was really unlucky.</p>
<p>“How is that? Do you dare to agree?” Qin Mu continued to ask.</p>
<p>Qin Mu was certain that Zhou Wen would agree to it. A graduate student being provoked by a sophomore and in front of his girlfriend was something no one could tolerate.</p>
<p>“Here?” Zhou Wen looked around and asked. There were already quite a number of students who had come to watch the commotion. However, they knew Qin Mu’s character very well and were no longer surprised.</p>
<p>“Yes, right here. Everyone can be our witnesses. Of course, if you’re afraid of losing and embarrassing yourself, we can also get a private room,” Qin Mu said with a grin.</p>
<p>“Doing it here will do.” Zhou Wen also wanted to see what standards the top students of Sunset College had after five years. He wanted to know how they compared with his class.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll use a sword. Senior, what will you use?” Qin Mu took a practice sword from the weapon rack and asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Since you use a sword, I’ll use a sword too,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Don’t regret posturing.” Qin Mu curled his lips and threw a practice sword at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen caught the sword before walking to the center of the training grounds.</p>
<p>“You’re a senior, shouldn’t you give me a three-strike handicap?” Qin Mu asked with a grin.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Zhou Wen nodded with a smile.</p>
<p>“Senior, I won’t stand on ceremony then,” Qin Mu thought to himself. I know all the powerful ones among the graduate students. I haven’t seen this one before, so he’s definitely not at the Epic stage. He wants to beat me at the Legendary stage? To think he dares give me a three-strike handicap. He’s simply blinded by greed. That’s good too. If I finish you in three strikes, I can definitely make that female senior view me in a different light.</p>
<p>No. Three strikes isn’t cool enough. I’ll finish him in one strike. Qin Mu thought for a moment and still felt that dealing a single deathblow was more handsome and could leave an impression in the eyes of the beautiful female senior.</p>
<p>“Senior, I’m about to strike. You have to be careful.” Qin Mu was very confident in his sword art. Unless one’s level was higher than his, there weren’t many people at the same level who could dodge his full-powered strike.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen nodded with a smile.</p>
<p>Qin Mu didn’t immediately strike. Instead, he took a few steps forward and found Zhou Wen standing still. He stood there with his sword in hand and allowed him to approach with no intent of retreat. He couldn’t help but sneer inwardly. You know I’m Qin Zhen’s younger brother, yet you still dare let me come so close. You can only blame it on yourself if you can’t even block one strike.</p>
<p>When he reached the attack range that he was most proficient in, Qin Mu suddenly struck out with his sword. That strike was like a fleeting glimpse. Coupled with his movement technique, it was unbelievably fast, but it was also extremely elegant. It was like an immortal riding a sword for an assault on the enemy. In a flash, he could take the head of the general amidst thousands of soldiers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be surprised when he saw Qin Mu’s sword art.</p>
<p>Although Qin Mu’s sword art was fast, it was only fast enough among Legendaries. In Zhou Wen’s eyes, this strike was extremely slow. It was impossible for it to touch him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was surprised that the sword art was very similar to his Transcendent Flying Immortal. It wasn’t the present Transcendent Flying Immortal, but the Transcendent Flying Immortal from his college days. Although this strike had some changes, the core remained the same.</p>
<p>Strange, why would he use my Transcendent Flying Immortal? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>This was unlike Sei Gasakai, who had only observed Zhou Wen’s sword moves and sword intent before figuring out a concept similar to Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>Although the two were very similar, there were still some differences in the core and details.</p>
<p>However, Qin Mu’s sword art was different. His sword art had details that were unique to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Strange, I’ve never taught anyone my sword art, much less someone with the surname Qin. Why does this Qin Mu know my sword art? Zhou Wen was filled with puzzlement.</p>
<p>Qin Mu originally wanted to defeat Zhou Wen with one strike and had used 90% of his strength. His speed was also astonishing.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, the practice sword in Zhou Wen’s hand blocked Qin Mu’s sword, preventing him from succeeding.</p>
<p>Qin Mu was slightly surprised. He didn’t expect this unremarkable graduate student to be able to block the sword art his sister had taught him.</p>
<p>I’ll see how many strikes you can block. When Qin Mu saw that Zhou Wen didn’t react, he thought that he had already used all his strength to block his attack and didn’t have the ability to counterattack. Therefore, he launched a storm-like attack.</p>
<p>Strike after strike, Qin Mu’s sword art was elegant and ruthless. It was indeed a good sword art that was hard to come by.</p>
<p>After watching a few strikes, Zhou Wen finally understood. This sword art was indeed Transcendent Flying Immortal from back when he was at school. However, it had been modified by someone and had indeed reached a very high level. It was much stronger than Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal from back then. However, the core hadn’t changed. It was considered a variant of Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen still couldn’t recall when he had taught the sword art to a person with the surname Qin.</p>
<p>After more than ten strikes, Zhou Wen had already seen through Qin Mu’s sword art. There was no need for him to continue. Therefore, he struck out and sent Qin Mu’s practice sword flying.</p>
<p>“It looks like I’ve won.” Zhou Wen placed his practice sword back on the rack and asked Qin Mu, “Who taught you your sword art?”</p>
<p>“My sister.” Qin Mu thought of Qin Zhen and what he had said to Zhou Wen. He immediately felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen really requested to go on a date with Qin Zhen, Qin Mu wouldn’t tell her it was down to a battle. The reason he had said that was because he hadn’t expected to lose.</p>
<p>However, on second thought, the other party’s girlfriend was here. He wouldn’t suggest going on a date with his sister, right?</p>
<p>“Where did your sister learn her sword art from?” Zhou Wen wanted to know where she had learned Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>“Why are you asking this?” Qin Mu sized up Zhou Wen warily. He imagined that Zhou Wen was eyeing Qin Zhen’s sword art.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that you wanted to arrange a date between me and your sister? Can we do it today?” Zhou Wen wanted to meet the female sword immortal, Qin Zhen, and ask her where she had learned Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1161'>Chapter 1161: Female Sword Immortal</h3>
<p>Qin Mu’s face darkened. He didn’t dare take Zhou Wen to his sister. Furthermore, he never expected him to really dare visit his sister.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that his girlfriend was here, just the fame of his sister as Female Sword Immortal was enough to scare away many suitors. Ordinary men didn’t have the courage to stand in front of his sister.</p>
<p>However, Qin Mu thought about it again. He had seen many outstanding men, but when they really stood in front of his sister, all of them quickly lost their confidence. They would become at a loss for words because Qin Zhen’s aura was too strong.</p>
<p>Even if he really took Zhou Wen to see Qin Zhen, Zhou Wen probably wouldn’t dare say anything rash in front of her. Perhaps he could bluff his way through.</p>
<p>“Senior, do you really want to meet my sister?” Qin Mu asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Didn’t we agree on this?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Alright, I, Qin Mu, admit defeat. I’ll take you there now. Follow me if you have the guts.” After Qin Mu said that, he walked out of the training grounds.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Tsukuyomi and saw that she didn’t have any special reaction. Only then did he pick up Ya’er and follow. Tsukuyomi followed behind.</p>
<p>As for many students who had enjoyed the battle, they followed behind as though they wanted to see if Zhou Wen would really date Female Sword Immortal. She was the goddess that many boys in school had a crush on.</p>
<p>Qin Mu walked in front for a while and saw that Zhou Wen had really followed him. Furthermore, he had brought two beauties—one young, one old—with him. He couldn’t help but ask in surprise, “Don’t tell me you plan on taking them to see my sister?”</p>
<p>“Can’t I?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Sure, of course. As you wish.” Qin Mu thought to himself, Is this fellow stupid? It would be strange if he doesn’t get beaten up when he takes this woman to see my sister. However, this is also good. When that happens, my sister won’t be in the mood to care about me.</p>
<p>Qin Zhen was a tutor at Sunset College. She lived there, so they didn’t need to leave the campus.</p>
<p>Luoyang had a very high status in the Federation, and Sunset College had long been famous throughout the Federation.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that the Federation President had once studied at Sunset College, just Luoyang’s present strength was enough to match the six families.</p>
<p>However, these powerful figures didn’t completely belong to the An family. Otherwise, the An family might have become the seventh family clan.</p>
<p>Qin Mu quickly led Zhou Wen and company to Qin Zhen’s residence. This place surprised Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Four Seasons Garden. Your sister lives here?” Zhou Wen asked as he looked at the building in front of him.</p>
<p>This was the Four Seasons Garden that had previously been reserved for special admissions students. Furthermore, the building that Qin Zhen lived in was the same one that he used to live in.</p>
<p>Although many small buildings in Four Seasons Garden had been rebuilt, the three buildings in the last row didn’t seem to have changed much. They were about the same as before.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Are you going in?” Qin Mu asked Zhou Wen with a grin.</p>
<p>He was very relaxed now. Zhou Wen was holding the hand of a girl who was about seven or eight years old. Behind him was a beauty who looked to be in her twenties. All he needed to do was tell Qin Zhen that this man wanted to woo her. With Qin Zhen’s temper, the outcome was obvious.</p>
<p>“Why not?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Alright, wait a moment. I’ll take you to see my sister now.” Qin Mu pushed open the door and walked in. When he arrived in front of the building, he pressed the doorbell.</p>
<p>“Sis, are you there?” Qin Mu shouted at the video doorbell.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” A cold woman’s voice sounded from inside. She didn’t sound old, but her attitude was very cold.</p>
<p>“There’s a senior who wants to get to know you. I brought him over to meet you,” Qin Mu said as he turned his body to the side, allowing Qin Zhen to see Zhou Wen standing behind him through the video.</p>
<p>“By the way, Senior, what’s your name?” Only then did Qin Mu realize that he didn’t even know Zhou Wen’s name.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored him and looked at the door. He didn’t use Truth Listener to scan the situation inside. After all, she was a woman and not an enemy. It would be impolite.</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhou Wen didn’t answer, Qin Mu asked again.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could answer, the door to the building opened. A young woman in her twenties walked out.</p>
<p>She wore the combat uniform produced by the An family, accentuating her perfect figure. Although she wasn’t too tall, her figure was very well-proportioned.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately found the woman’s face familiar. After some thought, he immediately recalled and knew where she had learned Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>I never expected that the silent and introverted junior from back then would have already become a famous Female Sword Immortal in the Federation, Zhou Wen thought wistfully.</p>
<p>Back then, he noticed that a female junior had quite a bit of talent in the way of the sword, so he had casually given her some scattered notes he had already memorized while practicing Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t take this matter to heart at all. He had long forgotten about it. Furthermore, he never expected that the junior would use the scattered notes in the notebook to cultivate Transcendent Flying Immortal to such an extent. She had even become a famous Female Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for Zhou Wen’s good memory, he would have found it unbelievable that Qin Zhen was the junior from back then.</p>
<p>When Qin Mu saw Qin Zhen walk out, he thought that Qin Zhen wanted to chase Zhou Wen away. Therefore, he fanned the flames and said, “Sis, let me introduce you. This senior wants to date you. And this person is his fiancée… I don’t know what relationship this little girl has with them. Senior, could this be your daughter…”</p>
<p>Qin Mu was secretly delighted. He felt that Qin Zhen would definitely teach this reckless senior a lesson.</p>
<p>Just as he expected, Qin Zhen walked towards Zhou Wen like a gust of wind.</p>
<p>Qin Mu was already beginning to worry for Zhou Wen. If Qin Zhen was too heavy-handed and crippled him, it would be difficult to explain things to the college.</p>
<p>As he was thinking, Qin Zhen stood in front of Zhou Wen. Just as Qin Mu thought that Qin Zhen’s terrifying attack was coming, he saw Qin Zhen stop in front of Zhou Wen. She didn’t draw her sword or attack.</p>
<p>What was even more unbelievable was that Qin Zhen’s face revealed an expression that Qin Mu had never seen before.</p>
<p>It was difficult to describe her expression. It was as though she was pleasantly surprised, but at the same time, she seemed to be at a loss. The present Qin Zhen had no indication of the female sword immortal’s killing intent and arrogance at all. She was like a girl-next-door who was secretly in love with an older boy.</p>
<p>“Heavens… Is there something wrong with my eyes? That’s definitely not my dream goddess, Female Sword Immortal Qin Zhen, right? How can she have such an expression?” The male students who had come to watch the commotion were dumbfounded when they saw Qin Zhen’s expression.</p>
<p>Qin Mu was shocked beyond words. As a younger brother, he had never seen Qin Zhen like this.</p>
<p>“Senior.” Qin Zhen bowed her head and called out bashfully, as though she had become that introverted and shy junior from back then.</p>
<p>“God, smite me with lightning. I don’t want to live anymore. Tell me that it’s not Sword Immortal Qin Zhen. It’s definitely not…” Many boys wanted to kill Zhou Wen. How could a goddess show such an expression to another man? It was absolutely unforgivable.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1162'>Chapter 1162: Zhou Wen’s Return</h3>
<p>“Sis, this person has a fiancée,” Qin Mu hurriedly reminded Qin Zhen.</p>
<p>However, Qin Zhen ignored Qin Mu as if she hadn’t heard him.</p>
<p>“Not bad with your sword practice,” Zhou Wen praised as he looked at Qin Zhen. His words came from the bottom of his heart. To be able to master the sword art to such an extent using just a notebook was indeed extraordinary.</p>
<p>Although he hadn’t seen Qin Zhen use a sword, he could roughly tell from Qin Mu, whom she had taught.</p>
<p>Only Zhou Wen could say ‘not bad.’ In the eyes of others, it wasn’t as simple as ‘not bad.’</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, the students and Qin Mu had the urge to roll their eyes. Was there a need for him to praise the female sword immortal’s sword art? Furthermore, what did he mean by ‘not bad?’ Was he praising or criticizing her?</p>
<p>“I don’t deserve so much praise, Senior. My sword art still has many shortcomings. It’s not even a fraction of yours. If not for your guidance, I wouldn’t have my achievements today…” Qin Zhen said seriously.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Qin Zhen’s words, the entire campus seemed to explode. Qin Mu widened his eyes and stared at Zhou Wen in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Who is this person? Qin Zhen actually said that her sword art was thanks to his pointers?”</p>
<p>“Is there such an impressive figure in our school?”</p>
<p>“In terms of sword arts, I’m afraid only Overseer An and Chancellor Leng can guide the female Sword Immortal. However, this person is so young. He definitely isn’t Chancellor Leng or Overseer An.”</p>
<p>“I think Qin Zhen is being polite. This person might be the teacher who initiated her journey.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that must be it. However, he’s not very old. He’s not much older than Qin Zhen. How can he have initiated her journey?”</p>
<p>“What’s this senior’s name? Does no one know him?”</p>
<p>As everyone discussed, Qin Zhen continued, “Senior, there are still many things that I don’t understand about my sword art. Can you give me some pointers? I’m willing to pay any price.”</p>
<p>Everyone was dumbfounded when she said that. Qin Zhen, the Federation’s female Sword Immortal, actually wanted him to give pointers for her sword art. This was definitely not something a teacher who initiated her journey could do. The only possibility was that this person’s sword arts were better than Qin Zhen’s—and not just by a little.</p>
<p>“Who is he? Could he be the legendary Swordsman Tomorrow, Ming Xiu? I heard that Ming Xiu had once attended classes at our school. Perhaps he had taught Qin Zhen back then.”</p>
<p>“It’s not Professor Ming. It’s not like we haven’t seen Professor Ming’s photo before. This senior isn’t as delicate as Ming Xiu.”</p>
<p>“Ming Xiu might not necessarily be stronger than Qin Zhen, right?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Sis… This… Who is this senior?” Qin Mu stammered.</p>
<p>“This is Senior Zhou Wen. How can you not know him?” Qin Zhen finally heard Qin Mu’s words and answered.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen… He’s the Zhou Wen who was once invincible among his peers and suppressed the younger generation of the six families!”</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, so it’s him. No wonder. I just didn’t expect Qin Zhen to have learned her sword art from him.”</p>
<p>“I heard that he has been holding down the fort at Chess Mountain for the past few years. It’s no wonder I don’t recognize him.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing Qin Zhen say Zhou Wen’s name, many students felt relieved. Although Zhou Wen wasn’t in school most of the time, he was one of Sunset College’s legends.</p>
<p>“Follow me,” Zhou Wen said to Qin Zhen before turning to leave.</p>
<p>Qin Zhen immediately followed without any hesitation. Everyone wanted to follow, but Zhou Wen and company quickly left campus, while the students couldn’t.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took Qin Zhen to the An family’s training room and got her to showcase her sword art. She was stronger than Zhou Wen expected. Qin Zhen’s talent and concept in sword arts were also better than his expectations.</p>
<p>“Wait a moment.” Zhou Wen took out a pen and paper from the Chaos Bead and planned on writing down his experience of Transcendent Flying Immortal for Qin Zhen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t care if his sword art would spread. If someone could learn his sword art, he had the hope that there would be a few more people like Qin Zhen among humans.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Transcendent Flying Immortal had extremely high requirements for cultivators. It was difficult to gain basic mastery, and it was even more difficult to achieve anything higher. Therefore, it wasn’t suitable for most people to cultivate.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai had also fused the concept of Transcendent Flying Immortal into the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū that made it easy for others to pick up. Although it resolved the problem of most people finding it difficult to gain basic mastery, it also indirectly raised the difficulty of reaching the pinnacle.</p>
<p>For Zhou Wen, a person like Qin Zhen was a rare inheritor who could pick up his mantle.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>That night, An Tianzuo sat at the dining table and saw An Sheng and An Jing sitting on both sides. He said with a frown, “He’s getting more and more unruly. Doesn’t he know that it’s time to eat? Even if he’s not hungry, doesn’t he know that children need to eat more during their growth spurt?”</p>
<p>An Sheng hurriedly said, “Overseer, Young Master Wen brought a guest back. He’s currently busy in the training room.”</p>
<p>“What guest is more important than Ya’er’s body? If he wants to entertain guests, why doesn’t he let Ya’er come back for dinner?” An Tianzuo snorted coldly.</p>
<p>“I went to get Ya’er just now. She said she’s not hungry,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo couldn’t help but frown. After a pause, he asked, “Who did he bring back?”</p>
<p>“It’s Qin Zhen,” An Sheng answered.</p>
<p>“Qin Zhen?” An Tianzuo was slightly taken aback. “That female Sword Immortal from the college?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Overseer.”</p>
<p>“What are they doing in the training room?” An Tianzuo asked.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure. Perhaps they are sparring,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo was no stranger to the name Qin Zhen. There were very few experts from Sunset College—Hui Haifeng, Feng Qiuyan, Li Xuan, and Wei Ge were all very famous figures in the Federation.</p>
<p>However, there weren’t many who were truly willing to stay at Sunset College for the An family and Luoyang.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng was now the Federal President, while Feng Qiuyan was the pride of the Sea Return family. Although Li Xuan’s Li family was a wealthy family in Luoyang, Li Mobai was the one in charge. He wasn’t an easy person to deal with. Sometimes, even An Tianzuo had a headache over him.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was out most of the year and seldom returned.</p>
<p>There was no need to mention Wei Ge. He was in charge of the Special Investigation Bureau and was the eyes and ears of the Federation. Now that he had joined the League of Guardians, it was even more impossible for him to be used by the An family.</p>
<p>Among the experts remaining on campus, Qin Zhen was the strongest.</p>
<p>However, An Tianzuo always believed that Qin Zhen was more suitable for the battlefield than teaching in school. Therefore, he had personally persuaded Qin Zhen to join the army many times, but Qin Zhen had rejected him.</p>
<p>Through their interaction, An Tianzuo knew that Qin Zhen wasn’t someone who was afraid of challenges, but for some reason, she was unwilling to leave the school.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo found it odd that Qin Zhen had followed Zhou Wen to the An family home. After some thought, he stood up and said, “Let’s go take a look.”</p>
<p>An Sheng and An Jing got up and followed An Tianzuo to the training room. They were also very curious about what Zhou Wen and Qin Zhen were doing.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1163'>Chapter 1163: There’s Something Very Problematic About You</h3>
<p>“Young Master Wen, are you still busy? The food has been prepared. Overseer is here to take Miss Ya’er back. Why don’t you let Miss Ya’er return for dinner?” An Sheng arrived outside the training room and pressed the video doorbell.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could finish writing, he got Ya’er to open the door for An Sheng and company.</p>
<p>Ya’er opened the door and An Tianzuo and company looked inside. Indeed, they saw Qin Zhen standing there.</p>
<p>However, what puzzled An Tianzuo and company was that Qin Zhen and Zhou Wen weren’t sparring. It didn’t even look like they had sparred. Instead, Zhou Wen was standing in front of a table, writing. Qin Zhen was watching from the side, completely engrossed.</p>
<p>Does this punk know calligraphy? An Tianzuo was puzzled.</p>
<p>Writing beautiful words wasn’t difficult for humans at their level and their level of evolution.</p>
<p>He didn’t even need much practice. All he needed to do was take a look at some famous masterpieces and he could easily imitate the beautiful fonts.</p>
<p>However, a nice font didn’t mean it was good calligraphy. One needed to fuse their thoughts into the words to form a unique style. Only then could it be called calligraphy.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo secretly glanced at it and realized that although Zhou Wen’s words weren’t ugly, they definitely weren’t good.</p>
<p>Yet, such ordinary calligraphy left Qin Zhen engrossed as she stood there motionless.</p>
<p>Since it’s not a problem of the text, it should be the content. An Tianzuo wanted to see what Zhou Wen had written, but Zhou Wen had already finished writing.</p>
<p>After putting away the pen, Zhou Wen picked up the notebook and handed it to Qin Zhen. “Take a look.”</p>
<p>“Can… can I?” Qin Zhen didn’t dare to take it.</p>
<p>She had watched the entire process. Although Zhou Wen wrote quickly and the content was too profound, Qin Zhen had only taken a few general glances in many sections and hadn’t read them carefully.</p>
<p>However, just the content she saw made Qin Zhen understand that Zhou Wen wasn’t giving her parts of a sword art, but a systematic introduction to the sword art. Furthermore, it had some of Zhou Wen’s own experience and insights.</p>
<p>The value of this book made Qin Zhen hesitate.</p>
<p>“Of course. Sword arts are created for people to use. If you can learn it, take it,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>Qin Zhen looked at Zhou Wen and saw that his expression was the same as when he had given her the notebook. She couldn’t help but feel a little dazed as she reached out to receive the Transcendent Flying Immortal notebook that Zhou Wen had written.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo also understood that what Zhou Wen had written was likely some kind of sword art. From Qin Zhen’s solemn expression, he guessed that this sword art was no trifling matter.</p>
<p>However, An Tianzuo didn’t know if the sword art Zhou Wen had written was his or was obtained from somewhere else.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo wanted to know, but he didn’t ask.</p>
<p>However, An Sheng didn’t have any qualms. He said with a smile, “Young Master Wen, are you very familiar with Sword Immortal Qin? Can you even study sword arts together?”</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could say a word, Qin Zhen said with a serious expression, “Adjutant An, don’t joke around. How am I qualified to study sword techniques with Senior? Senior Zhou is my tutor. He taught me my sword arts.”</p>
<p>With that said, An Tianzuo and An Jing looked at each other. Qin Zhen could be said to be one of the most outstanding women in Sunset College over the years. She could go down in history for the school.</p>
<p>Yet, she said that Zhou Wen had taught her sword arts, but they knew very well that Zhou Wen had been missing for five years. How could he have taught Qin Zhen sword arts?</p>
<p>However, An Sheng didn’t care. His eyes darted around as he said to Qin Zhen, “Qin Zhen, since you learned your sword arts from Young Master Wen, you should be focusing on actual combat. Are you interested in joining the Sunset Army? On the one hand, you can protect everyone. On the other hand, you can also hone your sword arts…”</p>
<p>Qin Zhen didn’t answer as she looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glared at An Sheng and said, “My sword art does focus on actual combat, and it’s extremely risky in actual combat. You might lose your life if you aren’t careful. It’s best to follow your heart and not be affected by others.”</p>
<p>An Sheng smiled without saying a word as though he hadn’t seen Zhou Wen’s glare.</p>
<p>Qin Zhen thought for a moment before looking at An Sheng and asking, “Can I go to the place that Senior went to in the past?”</p>
<p>“Of course, but it’s very dangerous there,” An Sheng said solemnly.</p>
<p>“I’m not afraid of danger,” Qin Zhen said.</p>
<p>“Then it’s settled. Sword Immortal Qin, Overseer has already prepared some food. Shall we have a meal with Young Master Wen?” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Qin Zhen nodded slightly and agreed.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo was somewhat delighted when he saw Qin Zhen agree.</p>
<p>With Qin Zhen’s talent, it was too wasteful for her to teach on campus. After she trained in the military for a few years, she would definitely be a mighty person who could hold her own in the future.</p>
<p>However, he had invited Qin Zhen to join the army several times, but he hadn’t been able to succeed. Now, Qin Zhen had clearly joined the Sunset Army because of Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen hadn’t even said a word, making An Tianzuo very displeased.</p>
<p>However, this didn’t stop him from liking Qin Zhen. He had already thought of how to train her, how to make her truly become a female Sword Immortal on the battlefield, and not just a female Sword Immortal in the arena.</p>
<p>Although both represented excellent combat strength, there were still some differences.</p>
<p>At the dining table, under An Sheng’s guidance, Qin Zhen told them what had happened between her and Zhou Wen. An Tianzuo and An Jing were stunned.</p>
<p>That punk really has good taste. Or was he lucky? He can actually produce a female Sword Immortal with just a crappy notebook? It must be luck. That punk might have only found her pretty… An Tianzuo couldn’t accept that the person he thought highly of was someone Zhou Wen had unintentionally nurtured.</p>
<p>After the meal, An Sheng got someone to take Qin Zhen back, but Zhou Wen stopped him and pulled him to a corner. “It wasn’t easy to find a successor for my sword art. I don’t want to see her die.”</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, don’t worry. Qin Zhen is talented, but she lacks the baptism of the battlefield. In the future, she will definitely become an existence like a war goddess. Overseer has long made plans for her. He definitely won’t let such a person die in vain.” An Sheng paused before saying, “Furthermore, in this world, with Qin Zhen’s strength, it’s only a matter of time before she enters the battlefield. It’s better to do so earlier rather than later, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally understood this principle. All he could do was sigh helplessly and say nothing else.</p>
<p>He, too, had no choice. He didn’t know how long he could live.</p>
<p>An Sheng was right. Letting Qin Zhen enter the Sunset Army now, with An Sheng taking care of her and An Tianzuo’s recognition, was better than being forced to participate in a battle in the future.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, I realize that there’s something very problematic about you!” An Sheng suddenly sized up Zhou Wen and said in a strange tone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt his hair stand on end from An Sheng’s gaze. “Ah Sheng, don’t spout nonsense. What problem can I have?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1164'>Chapter 1164: Bad News</h3>
<p>“We are already so familiar with each other. Young Master Wen, just admit it honestly. My lips are sealed,” An Sheng said with a wink.</p>
<p>“What do I admit?” Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat as he thought to himself, Could it be that An Sheng has discovered the secret of the phone?</p>
<p>“You’re actually a reincarnator, right?” An Sheng whispered.</p>
<p>“What’s a reincarnator? Is it some level? Or a Guardian?” Zhou Wen asked in a daze.</p>
<p>“Stop pretending. A reincarnator is someone who has lived once and returned to the past. Young Master Wen, you are a reincarnator, right? Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen finally understood what An Sheng meant. He said, at a loss whether to laugh or cry, “Have you watched too much television recently? Have you been brainwashed by television?”</p>
<p>An Sheng smiled and said, “Young Master Wen, if you weren’t a reincarnator, how could you do so many things that seem prescient?”</p>
<p>“What have I done that seemed prescient?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>An Sheng listed them one by one. “After you became Wang Mingyuan’s disciple, he entered the dimension and became an overlord of the dimension. You have a good relationship with Wang Mingyuan’s disciples. Now that Hui Haifeng has become the president of the Federation, he has developed Mythical Serums. It’s like he has a cheat code. Zhong Ziya might very well be the president of the Holy Spirit Association. That fellow, Liu Yun, has footprints all over Earth. He has entered countless mysterious dimensional zones and has stolen countless benefits. He’s known as the number one thief.</p>
<p>“What’s outrageous is that you have a good relationship with Li Xuan. Li Xuan is almost immortal now. Furthermore, he has an extremely good relationship with the Dugu family and has great influence. Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu both view you as their master. Now, they are known as the dual masters of swords and sabers. Their fame has shaken the Federation. They are the idols of young bladesmen. Even worse is that a random notebook you threw at her created a female Sword Immortal. Do you dare say that you aren’t a reincarnator? You must have known that they had excellent talent long ago, so you established a relationship with them, right?”</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng, I think with your imagination, it’s a waste of talent not to write novels.” Zhou Wen didn’t explain as he turned around and left.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen couldn’t explain it. Thinking about it, he really did look like a f*cking reincarnator.</p>
<p>“It’s just a joke. Young Master Wen, don’t be angry!” An Sheng chased after him. He was indeed joking. How could there be reincarnators in this world? However, Zhou Wen’s past was indeed like a bug in games.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi sat in the stone pavilion in the yard with her phone in her hand, but she wasn’t looking at it. Instead, she stared blankly at the moon in the sky and sat motionless for a long while.</p>
<p>Eventually, Tsukuyomi retracted her gaze and sighed softly. She muttered to herself, “Must I really leave?”</p>
<p>As she muttered to herself, Tsukuyomi switched on her phone and looked at Zhou Wen’s number in the chat app. After clicking it open, she entered some words. Then, seemingly finding it inappropriate, she deleted them and wrote some words before deleting them again.</p>
<p>After repeating this process a few times, Tsukuyomi ultimately didn’t send the message and locked the phone.</p>
<p>This is my life. Why do I have to do so much? Tsukuyomi put down her phone and stared blankly at the sky. She knew that she didn’t have much time left.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, an urgent message was placed on An Tianzuo’s desk. An Tianzuo read it again and again with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>“Overseer, did something really happen in Netherworld City?” An Sheng rushed over in a hurry without even buttoning his clothes.</p>
<p>This was almost impossible for An Sheng. Even in a life-and-death situation, he would tidy himself up meticulously. He wouldn’t be so flustered even if the sky collapsed.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo’s expression darkened as he nodded slightly and said, “Missing. Everyone has gone missing. The people we sent found Netherworld City and saw where my mother and company had stationed themselves. However, there wasn’t a single person at the camp. From the traces at the scene, I don’t know why, but they entered Netherworld City.”</p>
<p>“Did anyone enter Netherworld City to look for them?” An Sheng hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, but they didn’t see anyone,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“That’s impossible. Madam and the rest are already very familiar with the situation in Netherworld City. Even if they were forced to enter, it’s impossible for them to die in such a short period of time…” An Sheng said in disbelief.</p>
<p>“There’s indeed no one. It’s as though they vanished into thin air,” An Tianzuo said as he stood up and said calmly, “Make preparations. I’m going to Netherworld City. Also, don’t tell An Jing about this.”</p>
<p>After a pause, An Tianzuo added, “Don’t tell that punk either.”</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen knows Netherworld City very well. If he travels with us, the chances of rescuing Madam will be much higher,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“His surname isn’t An, nor is he my mother’s son. He has no obligation to risk his life for us,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“But…” An Sheng wanted to say something, but he was interrupted by An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>“No buts. Make the preparations. Do as I say and prepare everything as soon as possible. I have to set off before noon today.” An Tianzuo waved his hand, gesturing for An Sheng to prepare.</p>
<p>“Yes.” An Sheng could only leave to prepare.</p>
<p>After some hesitation, An Sheng finally went to Zhou Wen’s yard and told him about it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression turned solemn after hearing the news.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan and company had long figured out the situation in Netherworld City. Even if they were forced to enter, they should have been able to come out.</p>
<p>Even if they couldn’t come out, it was impossible that they would die so quickly.</p>
<p>Now that they were nowhere to be found—either dead or alive—Zhou Wen thought of a terrifying possibility.</p>
<p>Could it be that they experienced all the punishments and saw the true Netherworld? Zhou Wen’s expression changed.</p>
<p>He remembered very clearly what City Lord Netherworld had said. The Netherworld City he saw wasn’t the real Netherworld City. Only by experiencing all the punishments could one enter the real Netherworld.</p>
<p>c</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng, I need to make a trip. Help me take care of this place.” Zhou Wen originally wanted to leave Ya’er behind, but to his surprise, Ya’er looked at him. Zhou Wen knew from her gaze that it was impossible to leave her here again.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, go to Netherworld City with Overseer. You can take care of each other,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“No, I’m not going to Netherworld City. I want to make a trip to the South District,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“South District?” An Sheng was slightly taken aback, unsure what Zhou Wen meant.</p>
<p>“If I’m not wrong, I have to find someone to save Sis Lan,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Who?” An Sheng hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan.” Zhou Wen knew that he had to find Li Xuan as soon as possible and get him to follow him to Netherworld City. If he wasted too much time, it would probably be useless even if he entered the real Netherworld.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1165'>Chapter 1165: Myriad Elephant Valley</h3>
<p>Earth had undergone serious dimensionalization. Even a Mythical expert wouldn’t be able to travel from the East District to the South District as easily as they had done five years ago. Even if everything went smoothly, it would probably take more than half a month to make the trip.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen was proficient in spatial teleportation and had a spatial Calamity-grade expert, Tsukuyomi, by his side.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s spatial teleportation ability wasn’t enough to provide him with precise positioning from great distances, much less teleporting with Ya’er and company.</p>
<p>However, for the Calamity-grade Tsukuyomi, teleporting them to the Dugu family in the South District was just a matter of waving her hand.</p>
<p>As he didn’t know where Li Xuan was, Zhou Wen had no choice but to make a trip to the Dugu family residence to find Worm Dugu and ask him where he was.</p>
<p>The Dugu family was known as the most cowardly family. Even their old residence was built directly in a dimensional zone. The large-scale break-out of dimensional creatures didn’t affect the Dugu family much.</p>
<p>The dimensional zone where the Dugu family’s old residence was was called Myriad Elephant Valley. There were no elephants there, but the valley was strange. Without the guidance of the Dugu family, even a Mythical expert might not be able to walk out and for the rest of his life would be trapped in Myriad Elephant Valley.</p>
<p>At that moment, a man and a woman were standing outside the Myriad Elephant Valley with a little girl, a golden eagle, and a white antelope. They were sizing up the stone monument outside Myriad Elephant Valley.</p>
<p>This entourage was naturally Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi. The chick and antelope also followed. Zhou Wen wanted them to stay with the An family, but they refused.</p>
<p>Outside Myriad Elephant Valley stood a stone monument. On the left of the stone monument were the words: “Calling to the heavens and earth, none heed my call.” On the right were the words “A life of solitude.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at it for a long time and found it odd. It wasn’t a couplet, nor was it a poem. It looked odd no matter how he looked at it.</p>
<p>If it’s a life of solitude, it might be a name chosen because of superstition, but, when written in Chinese characters, the word “solitude” is written in opposite order from the Dugu family’s surname. It shouldn’t be a human name. Zhou Wen looked outside Myriad Elephant Valley for quite some time, but he didn’t see anyone from the Dugu family.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s eyes and ears were extremely sharp. He had long discovered that there were many strange creatures lurking around. There were Gu that resembled grains of sand and dimensional creatures that resembled grass.</p>
<p>The seemingly calm entrance to Myriad Elephant Valley was actually filled with killing intent. However, the strange creatures didn’t attack solely because they hadn’t received their master’s orders.</p>
<p>“I’m Zhou Wen, a friend of Worm Dugu. I’m here to visit,” Zhou Wen shouted at the valley.</p>
<p>“You are Zhou Wen from Luoyang’s An family?” A voice sounded from the valley, but no one could be seen.</p>
<p>“I’m from Luoyang, but my surname isn’t An. My name is Zhou Wen,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Why do you want to see our Second Master?” That voice sounded again.</p>
<p>“I have something to ask him.” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback when he heard the title Second Master. Then, he recalled that Worm Dugu was ranked second in his generation. Dugu Ge called him Second Uncle. Presumably, this Second Master was what juniors called him.</p>
<p>“What is it?” the voice asked again.</p>
<p>“I can only say it when I see Worm Dugu,” Zhou Wen said with a frown.</p>
<p>“Second Master isn’t home. Go back,” the person in the valley said again.</p>
<p>“Where did he go?” Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed when he heard that. If Worm Dugu wasn’t around, it would be even harder to find Li Xuan. He couldn’t wait that long.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” the voice in the valley said.</p>
<p>Since I can’t find Li Xuan, I can only try to receive Netherworld City’s punishment myself. Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. He had tried Netherworld City’s punishment. If he didn’t use Great Brahma to cheat, Zhou Wen wasn’t confident that he could survive all the punishments.</p>
<p>However, if he used Great Brahma to cheat, he wouldn’t be able to open the true entrance to the Netherworld. Therefore, it was best if he could find Li Xuan. If he couldn’t, Zhou Wen could only give it a try himself.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly heard a bang. Turning his head, he saw a man covered in blood rush out of Myriad Elephant Valley and fall to the ground.</p>
<p>“Save me. I know where Second Master is.” The man seemed to use his last ounce of strength as he shouted at Zhou Wen before fainting.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately saw that the person’s injuries weren’t trivial. They weren’t as simple as losing consciousness. He was about to die.</p>
<p>In his body, he could see many Gu drilling around. His heart and other organs were riddled with holes. It was already a miracle that he was still alive.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally didn’t plan on crossing the Dugu family, but something was amiss about this whole thing. Furthermore, the person said that he knew of Worm Dugu’s whereabouts.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was watching, swarms of worms suddenly flew out of Myriad Elephant Valley like black fog and swept towards the unconscious man.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the Bronze Sparrow Sword and made it fly over. Wherever the flames passed, large swaths of worms were immediately burned to death.</p>
<p>“This is a family matter for our Dugu family. I believe it has nothing to do with you?” the voice in the valley sounded again.</p>
<p>“Your Dugu family’s matters are indeed unrelated to me, but he knows Worm Dugu’s whereabouts. After he wakes up and tells me Worm Dugu’s whereabouts, I’ll hand him over to you,” Zhou Wen said as he walked towards the unconscious man.</p>
<p>The man’s condition was terrible. His body was almost shutting down from the Gu’s bites. The only difference from a dead person was his breathing. He needed immediate treatment.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t know Second Master’s whereabouts. He just wants to use you to escape,” the voice in the valley said.</p>
<p>“We’ll know if it’s true after asking.” Zhou Wen stood in front of the man and began carving the Ancient Sovereign Sutra on the Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>In his present situation, ordinary healing abilities were useless. Even if he used the Rejuvenation Pill, he could only heal some wounds. However, the Gu in his body were still there. It was useless just to heal his wounds.</p>
<p>Only the Ancient Sovereign Sutra could heal this man under such circumstances and extract all the Gu in his body.</p>
<p>“It’s not up to you to decide on the Dugu family’s matters.” Just as Zhou Wen was about to help the man, he saw another person rush out of Myriad Elephant Valley.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a careful look and saw that the person’s face was covered in a black veil. His entire body was wrapped up, making it impossible to see his appearance. All he knew was that it was a man.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, I’ve heard of your name. You are indeed an impressive person. However, this is a family matter of my Dugu family. If you insist on interfering, even if our Dugu family is unwilling, we can only treat you as an enemy and dispose of you with all our might.” At the moment the black-robed man appeared, a large number of Gu flew out with him. It was unknown how many of them there were. Furthermore, there were many types, not just one.</p>
<p>“If you trust our Dugu family, I can use the Dugu family’s reputation to guarantee that this traitor doesn’t know the whereabouts of Worm Dugu. He only wants to use you,” the black-robed man said again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that the black-robed man’s words made sense, but he didn’t plan on returning the person. He had to personally interrogate him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1166'>Chapter 1166: God of Unkilling</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out to grab the man on the floor. The black-robed man didn’t hesitate to order a large number of Gu to lunge at the unconscious man. Like a sandstorm, they were everywhere.</p>
<p>The characteristics of those Gu were completely different. If it were an ordinary person, they would definitely not be able to handle so many.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could move, Chick let out a long cry. Countless Gu instantly fell from the sky. Although they didn’t die, they lay on the ground trembling, completely ignoring their master’s orders.</p>
<p>The black-robed man’s pupils constricted as he urged the Gu, but it was completely useless. Even the Mythical Gu were trembling silently on the ground. No matter how he urged, there was no reaction.</p>
<p>The man in black bit the tip of his tongue and spat out a mouthful of blood. He wanted to use his Blood Essence to jolt the Gu, but the Gu remained motionless.</p>
<p>How is this possible? The black-robed man was alarmed.</p>
<p>Those Gu’s lives were intricately connected to him. He had forcefully spewed out his Blood Essence and Essence Energy to stimulate his potential, making the Gu feel the threat of death. Usually, they would fight to the death. Even if they encountered their natural enemy, they would fight to the death.</p>
<p>However, no matter how he stimulated his body’s potential, the Gu didn’t move as he wished—they only trembled.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already grabbed the unconscious man by the collar and lifted him up.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, do you know that our Dugu family has worked with the An family for many years? Do you really want to destroy the trust and relationship the two families have built over the years because of a traitor’s lies?” The black-robed man paused before continuing, “Furthermore, he has already been poisoned by all kinds of Gu. It’s impossible for him to live on. Is it worth it to do all that for a person who’s about to die? Hand him over to me. Our Dugu family will think of a way to contact Second Master. You just need to wait for a period of time.”</p>
<p>“I’ve already told you that my surname isn’t An. Furthermore, if the relationship is so easily severed, there’s no point maintaining it.” Zhou Wen looked at the man in his hand and continued, “Most importantly, I don’t have that much patience.”</p>
<p>With that said, Zhou Wen stabbed at the man’s body with his other hand. His fingers that were akin to a sharp blade stabbed into the man’s body with a resplendent glow.</p>
<p>His hand was like a blade as it slashed across the man’s body repeatedly.</p>
<p>When the black-robed man saw Zhou Wen’s actions, he imagined that he was going to personally finish off the unconscious man. He said with a smile, “Whoever understands the times is a great man. The Dugu family will remember your friendship. We will find Second Master as soon as possible…”</p>
<p>Before he could finish his sentence, his smile froze on his face. Then, his eyes were filled with horror.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s final punch struck the unconscious man. The Gu that had drilled into his body were sent flying. Even the Brain Drilling Worms that had drilled into his brain were no exception.</p>
<p>The moment the Gu were blasted out, Chick spat out a golden flame that burned all the Gu to ashes.</p>
<p>The black-robed man clearly saw that Zhou Wen’s attack had beaten the man into a pulp. There was no reason for him to continue living, nonetheless the man’s injuries rapidly healed. In an instant, he was like a normal person. The wounds on his body were completely gone.</p>
<p>The unconscious man had already woken up. He landed on the ground and crawled up. He looked at his body in surprise and delight.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, my Dugu family is being besieged by a group of unknown people. Second Master and the rest are trapped in Myriad Elephant Valley…” the man anxiously shouted at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Really?” Zhou Wen frowned as he looked at the black-robed man.</p>
<p>The black-robed man wasn’t flustered at all. He said with a smile, “Don’t tell me you will listen to a traitor spouting nonsense?”</p>
<p>“Does that mean the Dugu family is fine?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“They’re not exactly fine. It’s just a matter caused by this traitor. We’ll naturally be fine after capturing him,” the black-robed man said.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you must not believe him. He’s not a member of our Dugu family…” the man said anxiously.</p>
<p>“Isn’t your method too despicable? You want to incite Zhou Wen to become enemies with my Dugu family so that you can escape in the chaos? It’s useless. You are also a member of the Dugu family, so you should know the means of the Dugu family,” the black-robed man said indifferently.</p>
<p>The man was about to say something when Zhou Wen interrupted him and said, “Since the Dugu family is fine, I’ll take him in to take a look. If he’s a traitor, I’ll personally hand him over to Worm Dugu.”</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s do that. I’ll go in with you.” The man was delighted when he heard that and hurriedly expressed his stance.</p>
<p>“Sure.” The black-robed man agreed without any hesitation. He even looked at the man and sneered. “Unkilling Dugu, I’m afraid you are mistaken to use such means to sow discord between our Dugu family and Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen and Second Master are close friends. So what if you let him enter Myriad Elephant Valley?”</p>
<p>However, Unkilling Dugu said to Zhou Wen, “Zhou Wen, you have to be careful. Since he’s letting us into the valley, there must be an ambush inside.”</p>
<p>“Your name is Unkilling Dugu?” Zhou Wen didn’t know who was speaking the truth or who was lying. However, he knew the name Unkilling Dugu.</p>
<p>This person was very famous in the Dugu family. His birth name wasn’t this, but after condensing a Life Providence named God of Unkilling, he had the nickname Unkilling Dugu. Perhaps because the name of the God of Unkilling was too resounding, eventually, no one remembered his original name.</p>
<p>The God of Unkilling was indeed famous, but it was famous for being a crippled Life Providence. This was because with this Life Providence, Unkilling Dugu couldn’t even kill an ant. His Life Providence destined him to never be stained with blood.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Unkilling Dugu nodded.</p>
<p>“Your Life Providence is the God of Unkilling?” Zhou Wen sized up Unkilling Dugu and was somewhat suspicious. This was because the legendary Unkilling Dugu was likely in his forties or fifties, and this man looked to be in his thirties.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Unkilling Dugu saw Zhou Wen’s puzzlement and explained, “The Essence Energy Art I cultivate is somewhat special. It makes me look much younger than my actual age. Perhaps this is the benefit of not killing.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded and didn’t harp on Unkilling Dugu’s identity. He looked at the black-robed man and asked, “Can we enter the valley now?”</p>
<p>“Of course, you can do so anytime. I still have to thank you for helping our Dugu family capture the traitor. Our Dugu family will definitely repay you. However, you have to watch over Unkilling Dugu. He’s very sinister and he’s cunning. Don’t let him escape.” As the black-robed man spoke, he made an inviting gesture before walking towards Myriad Elephant Valley.</p>
<p>“He can’t escape.” Zhou Wen gestured for Unkilling Dugu to lead the way.</p>
<p>Unkilling Dugu didn’t hesitate. He gritted his teeth and walked towards Myriad Elephant Valley without any intention of retreating.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed behind Unkilling Dugu into Myriad Elephant Valley. Ya’er, Tsukuyomi, Chick, and the antelope followed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1167'>Chapter 1167: Unable to Tell the Truth</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Myriad Elephant Valley looked like a valley from the outside, but after walking in, he realized that there was a sea of clouds in front of him. Continuous mountain peaks protruded from the sea of clouds. It was a magical scene.</p>
<p>As for the spot where Zhou Wen and company were standing, it was surprisingly the top of a mountain. Wherever they looked, they could see palaces in the sea of clouds. They looked like real existences, but also like mirages.</p>
<p>In the sky, there were three suns and seven moons. There were even mountain peaks that grew in the opposite direction, as though they were about to plunge into the sea of clouds from above, forming an extremely bizarre world.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned around and realized that the entrance to the valley had vanished.</p>
<p>The Dugu family’s old residence was extremely mysterious, unknown to outsiders. Zhou Wen didn’t know much about Myriad Elephant Valley, so he couldn’t help but marvel at such a scene.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t see the scene of the battle, nor did he discover any signs of battle. This was different from what Unkilling Dugu had said.</p>
<p>“The truth is obvious. You should now know who’s lying, right?” the black-robed man said to Zhou Wen with a smile.</p>
<p>Unkilling Dugu hurriedly explained, “Zhou Wen, don’t believe him. There’s an all-encompassing taboo in Myriad Elephant Valley. Everything here is constantly changing. Everything is a superposition of reality and illusion. Be it the mountain peaks or the palaces, they are constantly switching between reality and illusion. Second Master and the rest are trapped in the old residence. The old residence is on Boundless Mountain. At this hour, it should still be in an incorporeal state, preventing us from entering. However, as long as we reach Boundless Mountain, we can see the ethereal Boundless Mountain and those people.”</p>
<p>“Since you say so, I’ll take Zhou Wen to Boundless Mountain to take a look. Let’s see how long you can insist otherwise,” the black-robed man said as he turned around and flew in a certain direction.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to summon his flying mount, he saw Chick flap its wings and immediately fly up. It grew bigger and bigger in midair, quickly turning into a golden cloud.</p>
<p>Chick chirped at Zhou Wen as though it wanted him to sit on its back.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted when he saw that Chick had such a transformation ability. He carried Ya’er onto Chick’s back as Tsukuyomi and the antelope followed.</p>
<p>Chick glared at Unkilling Dugu when he wanted to come up.</p>
<p>Unkilling Dugu wasn’t in the mood to fuss over this. He summoned an avian Companion Beast and followed.</p>
<p>After flying for a while, Unkilling Dugu suddenly shouted, “That’s not right. The direction he’s heading in isn’t Boundless Mountain. That’s…”</p>
<p>The black-robed man in front stopped and stared at Unkilling Dugu with a sneer. “So that’s how it is. You want to use Zhou Wen’s strength to rush into the Shinra Temple. What a good plan.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense. The direction you are heading in is the Shinra Temple. Zhou Wen, this is the way to Boundless Mountain. You have to believe me,” said Unkilling Dugu anxiously.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched the two of them argue, momentarily unable to tell who was speaking the truth and who was lying.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was more willing to believe Unkilling Dugu. This was because up to now, they had not seen a second member of the Dugu family. If the black-robed man was telling the truth, why didn’t a member of the Dugu family come out to help him explain?</p>
<p>As long as the other members of the Dugu family came out, they could naturally convince Zhou Wen. Although Zhou Wen didn’t know them all, he knew a few important figures of the Dugu family.</p>
<p>“You keep saying that the Dugu family is fine. Then call the other members of the Dugu family out.” Unkilling Dugu had clearly thought of this.</p>
<p>The black-robed man frowned and said, “Boundless Mountain is in an ethereal state. No one can come out.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to tell Zhou Wen that you are the only one guarding the entire Myriad Elephant Valley today?” Unkilling Dugu said coldly.</p>
<p>The black-robed man hesitated for a moment before explaining to Zhou Wen, “Today is the day of our Dugu family’s grand ceremony. Apart from me in charge of guarding the pass, everyone else is at Boundless Mountain. If you don’t believe me, you’ll know when you get there.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that Second Master isn’t around? Now, you’re saying that they’re all at Boundless Mountain?” Unkilling Dugu caught the flaw in the black-robed man’s words.</p>
<p>“Second Master hasn’t returned at all. It’s naturally impossible for him to participate in the grand ceremony,” the black-robed man said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw the two of them exchange words. Although what Unkilling Dugu said made sense, he couldn’t completely believe it.</p>
<p>“What kind of place is Shinra Temple?” Zhou Wen couldn’t decide who to listen to.</p>
<p>“Shinra Temple is the most mysterious place in Myriad Elephant Valley. There are extremely terrifying dimensional creatures suppressed inside. It’s a forbidden zone for my Dugu family. No one is allowed to enter. In the past, people from my Dugu family accidentally entered, but they were never to be found. He’s luring us over because he wants to use the power of the Shinra Temple to kill us,” Unkilling Dugu said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the black-robed man who said, “Shinra Temple is indeed our Dugu family’s forbidden zone. Outsiders are not allowed to enter. It’s extremely dangerous inside.”</p>
<p>“In that case, why did you say that Unkilling Dugu wants to rush into the Shinra Temple?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>The black-robed man answered, “Others will definitely die if they enter, but it’s different if Unkilling Dugu goes in. If he enters, not only will he not die, but he will also obtain extremely terrifying power. We definitely can’t let him enter.”</p>
<p>“Others die if they enter, but I obtain terrifying power when I enter. Isn’t that ridiculous?” said Unkilling Dugu.</p>
<p>“The matter is rather complicated. It’s a long, complicated story. To put it simply, it’s related to Unkilling Dugu’s Life Providence. If he enters and obtains the power of the Shinra Temple, not only will our Dugu family be damaged, but the entire Federation will also be greatly affected. Therefore, we definitely can’t let him succeed,” the black-robed man said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen really couldn’t tell who was speaking the truth.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, he’s stalling for time. Second Master and the rest are trapped in Boundless Mountain. If we are late, I’m afraid there’ll be no hope,” Unkilling Dugu said anxiously.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, I know that you have a good relationship with Second Master. If you are tricked by him and forcefully barge into the Shinra Temple, my Dugu family will be severely damaged. How will Second Master forgive himself?” the black-robed man said.</p>
<p>“What’s suppressed in Shinra Temple? A dimensional creature? Guardian? Or is it something else?” Zhou Wen had no choice but to continue asking.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. It is a secret of my Dugu family. Only the incumbent patriarchs know the truth,” the black-robed man said.</p>
<p>“Your claims are full of flaws. Since only the patriarch knows the truth, how do you know that I will obtain immense benefits if I enter? You are clearly stalling for time. Zhou Wen, quickly save Second Master and the rest. It will really be too late if you delay any further.” Unkilling Dugu wore an anxious expression.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1168'>Chapter 1168: Shinra Temple</h3>
<p>“Going anywhere is fine,” Tsukuyomi suddenly said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found it reasonable. With a Calamity-grade bigshot like Tsukuyomi with him, there was no danger to speak of no matter which route they took.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there was the antelope of unknown level beside him. With such a powerful lineup, it would be difficult for anything to happen.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s character was different. He felt that the resolution of anything with force was the last resort. He had a nagging feeling that there was no way to resolve the problem with force. Once he failed, there was no way out. He didn’t like that feeling.</p>
<p>Today was somewhat different. Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to waste. He had to find Li Xuan as quickly as possible before taking him to Netherworld City.</p>
<p>“Let’s head over there to take a look.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and finally chose the direction that Unkilling Dugu had mentioned.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen chose to head in this direction not because he believed Unkilling Dugu, but because in theory, if they were telling the truth, it either meant that the black-robed man was luring them to their deaths, while Unkilling Dugu only wanted to obtain strength. The latter was relatively less dangerous. In both cases, he would be tricked, but the latter was clearly safer.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, if he enters the Shinra Temple, the consequences will be unimaginable,” the black-robed man said with a heavy expression. He knew that he couldn’t stop Zhou Wen, so he could only continue, “If you have to go, it’s best you imprison Unkilling Dugu.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need. Let’s go.” Zhou Wen shook his head. He had his own thoughts, so there was no need to imprison Unkilling Dugu.</p>
<p>“Let’s leave quickly. I hope we can still save Second Master and the rest.” Unkilling Dugu rode his bird and flew in the direction he had chosen.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, do you know what you’ve done?” the black-robed man asked with a frown.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as he got Chick to speed up and followed behind Unkilling Dugu.</p>
<p>The black-robed man followed. Although he knew that he couldn’t stop Zhou Wen, it was impossible for him to do nothing. All he could do was wait for an opportunity.</p>
<p>Under Unkilling Dugu’s lead, the group flew through the sea of clouds, passing through various mountain peaks and palaces.</p>
<p>Some palaces were just illusions. They could directly pass through the palaces, but some palaces and mountains that looked like phantoms turned corporeal moments later. It looked magical and strange.</p>
<p>On many mountain peaks, the figures of dimensional creatures could be seen. However, in the illusory mountain peaks, the dimensional creatures couldn’t rush out. The corporeal mountain peaks were circled by Unkilling Dugu. Clearly, he didn’t wish to waste time.</p>
<p>After flying for more than an hour, the man in black, who had been silently following behind, suddenly said, “Shinra Temple is ahead. Now is the time. If we let him rush in, it will be too late to stop him.”</p>
<p>“What’s inside Shinra Temple?” Zhou Wen asked. He felt that even if the black-robed man wasn’t lying, he had to be hiding something.</p>
<p>A palace appeared in the sea of clouds in front of him. Unlike the other palaces, this palace was inverted at the end of the sky above.</p>
<p>There were many mountain peaks hanging down from the sky in Myriad Elephant Valley, but there was only one inverted palace. Regardless of whether this palace was Shinra Temple, it was an extraordinary place.</p>
<p>At this point, seeing that Unkilling Dugu was gradually approaching the palace, the black-robed man hesitated for a moment before saying, “I don’t know much. I only know that there’s a person trapped in Shinra Temple.”</p>
<p>“A person?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>“A member of our Dugu family. Furthermore, he’s someone we can’t let Unkilling Dugu meet. This is what the Patriarch said. There’s definitely no mistake.” The black-robed man looked at Unkilling Dugu and continued, “It’s not too late to stop him now. Don’t let him in.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen said to Unkilling Dugu, “The palace ahead isn’t Boundless Mountain, right? There’s no need to approach it. Let’s circle around it.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Unkilling Dugu agreed verbally, but he didn’t change his direction. He continued charging towards the inverted palace.</p>
<p>At this moment, it was obvious that Unkilling Dugu had been lying. His goal was the palace.</p>
<p>Chick let out a long cry and spewed out golden flames at Unkilling Dugu.</p>
<p>Although Chick now looked like an eagle, it actually had a phoenix bloodline. It spewed out phoenix flames and Unkilling Dugu and his Companion Beast were swept into the terrifying golden flames.</p>
<p>The Mythical Companion Beast was burned to ashes. Even Unkilling Dugu was aflame and on the brink of turning to ashes.</p>
<p>Even so, Unkilling Dugu didn’t die. With his body burning with phoenix flames, he suddenly sped up and transformed into a stream of light that rushed towards the inverted palace.</p>
<p>He can still live despite being burned to such a state. His ability is almost comparable to Li Xuan’s. Zhou Wen looked at Tsukuyomi. With a Calamity like Tsukuyomi around, it was impossible for Unkilling Dugu to charge into the Shinra Temple.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, Tsukuyomi had no intention of attacking at all. She only stood there and watched as the charred Unkilling Dugu tore through the door and rushed into the Shinra Temple.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled, but he wasn’t too surprised.</p>
<p>“It’s over.” The black-robed man sighed. Although he wanted to stop it, the speed that Unkilling Dugu had displayed at the end was something he couldn’t stop.</p>
<p>However, the black-robed man also knew that it wasn’t the time to blame Zhou Wen. Solving the problem was the priority.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, I’m afraid I’ll have to trouble you to stop Unkilling Dugu later. You can’t let him leave Myriad Elephant Valley. After the grand ceremony ends, our Dugu family will rush over to provide support. We are still about an hour away before the grand ceremony ends and Boundless Mountain materializes. I hope we can hold on until then,” the black-robed man said.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll naturally answer for the trouble I’ve caused,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>The man in black shook his head and smiled bitterly. He thought to himself, You have no idea how big the trouble you have stirred up.</p>
<p>However, since Zhou Wen was willing to stay behind to help, he didn’t harp on the matter. He continued, “I don’t know what kind of power Unkilling Dugu will obtain inside. You mustn’t be careless. Prepare for the worst. If you have any means to deal with it, it’s best you prepare immediately.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded but didn’t do anything. All he did was look at Shinra Temple.</p>
<p>Shinra Temple was pitch-black like ink. There were no signs of bricks at all, as though it was carved from a complete boulder. The appearance of the palace was ancient. It was only one floor, and it was squarish. It was somewhat different from ordinary rectangular palaces.</p>
<p>However, this palace had no signs or plaques. He didn’t know why it was called Shinra Temple.</p>
<p>“Why is this place called Shinra Temple?” Zhou Wen asked the black-robed man.</p>
<p>“This is the center of Myriad Elephant Valley, the core of everything. That’s why we call it Shinra Temple. If you want to ask me what’s inside, I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed. I’ve already told you everything I know. I only know that there’s a terrifying creature trapped inside, and it’s a member of our Dugu family,” the black-robed man said helplessly.</p>
<p>As the two of them spoke, Tsukuyomi suddenly walked towards the entrance of Shinra Temple.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1169'>Chapter 1169: Nameless Dugu</h3>
<p>Seeing Tsukuyomi walk over, Zhou Wen led Chick and the antelope towards Shinra Temple.</p>
<p>When the black-robed man saw that Zhou Wen and company were about to enter the Shinra Temple, he hurriedly said, “Shinra Temple’s taboo powers are extremely strong. If someone who has killed enters, they will definitely be injured by the taboo power. If they have killed plenty, they will probably be killed on the spot.”</p>
<p>In this era, other than special people like Unkilling Dugu, who hadn’t killed before? Even vegetarians had to hunt dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi acted as if she hadn’t heard him and walked straight into Shinra Temple.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already engraved the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. It was very difficult for the taboo power to have any effect on him. If needed, Zhou Wen could still use the power of the Heaven-Opening Scripture to protect Ya’er and Chick.</p>
<p>Ever since he had the scripture, the power of the Heaven-Opening Scripture could not only protect him, but it could also be used on others.</p>
<p>The antelope and Chick rushed in, looking even more anxious than Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was puzzled. He didn’t know why the two of them were in such a rush to enter, so he hurriedly followed.</p>
<p>After entering Shinra Temple, he saw Tsukuyomi, the antelope, and Chick inside. They weren’t injured by the taboo power.</p>
<p>Even Ya’er, who Zhou Wen was carrying, wasn’t injured by the taboo power. If it wasn’t for Zhou Wen’s Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder converting the taboo power into Essence Energy, Zhou Wen would have wondered if the taboo power mentioned by the black-robed man existed.</p>
<p>The black-robed man stood outside Shinra Temple, but he didn’t dare enter. He looked inside and realized that Zhou Wen and company hadn’t been injured by the taboo power. He couldn’t help but be surprised.</p>
<p>What’s going on with these fellows? Could it be that they have a special Life Providence like Unkilling Dugu? The black-robed man looked at Zhou Wen and company in surprise.</p>
<p>It was naturally impossible for Zhou Wen and company to have the God of Unkilling Life Providence. Apart from the antelope, who he had no idea if it had killed before, everyone else had definitely killed something.</p>
<p>Furthermore, an existence like Tsukuyomi was an existence that had triggered a calamity. The number of lives she had killed was probably uncountable. The number of sins she had committed far exceeded that of ordinary creatures.</p>
<p>However, Tsukuyomi was a Calamity-grade big shot. Since she had dared to enter Shinra Temple, she naturally had a way to deal with it. That wasn’t something Zhou Wen could understand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could roughly guess that Chick wasn’t affected by Shinra Temple’s taboo power.</p>
<p>It had the bloodline of a phoenix, and the phoenix itself was a nirvana creature. It wasn’t tainted by powers like karmic sinflames, so it was reasonable that the taboo powers of Shinra Temple were useless against it.</p>
<p>As for how the antelope did it, Zhou Wen had no idea, but he didn’t find it strange.</p>
<p>The only thing that surprised Zhou Wen was that Ya’er wasn’t affected. It looked like the taboo power hadn’t descended on her at all. It was unknown how she had done it.</p>
<p>Ya’er had killed any humans before, so she shouldn’t be unaffected.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t think too much about it as he began sizing up Shinra Temple. He saw a seven-meter-tall stone furnace in the middle of the squarish stone temple which had an ancient design. There were patterns like the sun, moon, and stars engraved on it, but they were simple dots and lines. It looked very crude.</p>
<p>Chains extended out from the stone furnace, trapping a strange creature on the walls.</p>
<p>At that moment, Unkilling Dugu stood in front of the stone furnace and pressed his hand on the creature’s body.</p>
<p>The creature had a human body, but it had a bull’s head. Furthermore, it was far taller than the average person. It was probably nearly three meters tall.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a look and a Mythical figure immediately appeared in his mind. He thought to himself, Don’t tell me this is Ox-Head of the Ox Head and Horse Face—guardians of the underworld?</p>
<p>Unkilling Dugu pressed his hands on Ox-Head’s chest. It was strange. There was a strange force flowing towards Unkilling Dugu from Ox-Head.</p>
<p>The power suffused a demonic golden light. After it entered Unkilling Dugu’s body, it made his body glow golden. Not only was his body changing, but it even began to condense golden armor that gradually enveloped his body.</p>
<p>Is that the power of a Guardian? That’s not right. It’s not a Guardian. It seems to have the aura of a human… Could it be… Zhou Wen looked at Ox-Head who was tied to the stone furnace and revealed a puzzled look.</p>
<p>To simultaneously have the power of a Guardian and the aura of a human, the only possibility Zhou Wen could think of was Wang Mingyuan and Zhong Ziya’s situation.</p>
<p>“The creature tied to the stone furnace is from your Dugu family?” Zhou Wen turned to ask the black-robed man outside the hall.</p>
<p>The man in black shook his head. “I don’t know. I’ve never seen him with my own eyes. However, I think it should be him.”</p>
<p>Clearly, the black-robed man wasn’t too sure either. Perhaps he really wasn’t lying.</p>
<p>At this moment, Unkilling Dugu, who was covered in golden armor, spoke. “That’s right. He’s from our Dugu family. Furthermore, everyone knows his name.”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me he’s that hero from the Dugu family?” Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat as he blurted out.</p>
<p>Among the six heroes of the Federation, the only one who was still alive was the old hero of the Dugu family.</p>
<p>However, what was the difference between living and dying if this was the way he lived?</p>
<p>“No, our patriarch is still presiding over the grand ceremony at Boundless Mountain,” said the black-robed man.</p>
<p>However, Unkilling Dugu sneered and said, “You are half right. He’s our hero, but only half.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“The so-called six heroes should be seven because our Dugu family has two heroes. Furthermore, they are twins. However, these twins are somewhat special. They basically don’t appear in front of outsiders at the same time. Therefore, outsiders only know that my Dugu family’s Nameless Dugu is a hero, but they don’t know that it’s untrue that Nameless doesn’t have a name. It’s just that they are two different people. They have their own names and no one can replace the other. That’s why they used this name,” said Unkilling Dugu.</p>
<p>The black-robed man’s eyes were filled with shock. Clearly, he hadn’t known of such a thing in the past.</p>
<p>“Since he’s the hero of the Dugu family, why is he trapped here?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“It’s because he chose a different path and submitted to the Holy Temple. He obtained the power the Holy Temple gave him and even wanted to take the entire Dugu family with him. That’s why he was imprisoned here by the other Nameless Dugu.” As Unkilling Dugu spoke, the golden light on the ox-headed man’s body weakened.</p>
<p>His extremely strong body began to shrink and quickly, it turned into a dried corpse.</p>
<p>As for the golden light over Unkilling Dugu’s body, it intensified. A golden helmet appeared over his face. The helmet enveloped his entire head—in the shape of an ox head.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1170'>Chapter 1170: Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light</h3>
<p>“From the looks of it, his strength suits you very well,” Zhou Wen said as he sized up Unkilling Dugu.</p>
<p>“You can’t really talk about suitability. Apart from that old fart, I’m the only one from the Dugu family who can enter Shinra Temple. He has no other choice.” Unkilling Dugu sized up Zhou Wen and company and said, “Thankfully, you aren’t from my Dugu family. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have had the chance to inherit Nameless Dugu’s power.”</p>
<p>Clearly, Zhou Wen and company weren’t affected by Shinra Temple, leaving Unkilling Dugu very surprised.</p>
<p>If a single person wasn’t affected, it could be said to be a coincidence. However, it was odd that so many people and pets weren’t affected.</p>
<p>However, this didn’t matter. Unkilling Dugu had already obtained what he wanted. Even though Zhou Wen and company had entered, there was no way for them to stop him.</p>
<p>Unkilling Dugu looked at Zhou Wen and said, “I still have to thank you for saving my life and helping me obtain true strength. After I become the owner of Myriad Elephant Valley, I will definitely repay you.”</p>
<p>“Since that half of Nameless Dugu failed to become the master of the Dugu family and is still trapped here, do you think you can do what he didn’t?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“He can’t, but I can,” said Unkilling Dugu confidently.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I can’t give you such a chance. I have to resolve the trouble I caused. I can’t trouble others,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You’re making things difficult for me. No matter what, I owe you. I don’t want to kill you,” said Unkilling Dugu with a sigh.</p>
<p>“Your debt to the Dugu family is greater for raising you. You don’t seem to have any intention of letting them off. I’m nothing,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Indeed. Since you’ve chosen this path, you have no choice but to continue.” Unkilling Dugu nodded slightly and looked at Zhou Wen. “It’s still not too late for you to back out now.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as he looked at Tsukuyomi and the antelope. Zhou Wen felt that the reason that the two of them had entered so eagerly wasn’t just to destroy Unkilling Dugu.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen remain silent, Unkilling Dugu continued, “Boundless Mountain is about to corporealize. I don’t have time to wait any longer. Since you aren’t willing to back off, I can only send you on your way.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, the golden light over Unkilling Dugu’s body turned into a blinding light. The golden light seemed to be able to pierce into a person’s soul, as though it was about to melt it.</p>
<p>The black-robed man’s expression changed drastically when he saw the golden light. He loudly warned Zhou Wen, “Retreat quickly… That’s the Soul-Washing Divine Light…”</p>
<p>“What’s the Soul-Washing Divine Light?” Zhou Wen’s body was bathed in the golden divine light, but he didn’t sense anything special.</p>
<p>“Outsiders only know that Nameless Dugu is good at movement techniques, but very few people know that his strongest trait isn’t his movement technique, but the Soul-Washing Divine Light. Those who are illuminated by the Soul-Washing Divine Light will have their memories wiped. No matter how strong your body is or how strong you are, if you don’t have any memories, you’ll be like a newborn baby. You will forget everything. It’s useless even if you have a powerful body… Quickly retreat… Don’t be illuminated by the Soul-Washing Divine Light again… You will completely lose your memories…” the black-robed man said anxiously when he saw that Zhou Wen still had no intention of moving.</p>
<p>Without waiting for Zhou Wen to say anything, Unkilling Dugu spoke. “This isn’t the Soul-Washing Divine Light. It should be called the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light. Nameless Dugu’s original powers combined with mine produces an effect that far exceeds the original Soul-Washing Divine Light. Now, not only can this divine light wash away memories, but it can also wipe out one’s souls, turning one’s body into a soulless, empty shell… However, I’m indebted to you after all… Now, I’ll only erase your memories… If you don’t leave… the next step won’t be as simple as erasing memories.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that he really couldn’t recall certain things, but it wasn’t his present memory.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Tsukuyomi again. She was the one who said that any path was fine. It was impossible for her to do nothing and leave the trouble to him, right?</p>
<p>However, Tsukuyomi’s eyes didn’t look at Unkilling Dugu at all. She kept staring at the stone furnace.</p>
<p>The Ox-Head on the stone furnace had already turned into a dessicated corpse. It looked like it would turn to dust the moment the wind blew. It looked like everything had been passed down to Unkilling Dugu.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi wasn’t looking at the creature, but the stone furnace itself.</p>
<p>The stone furnace was ancient and the patterns on it were very crude. If it wasn’t so big and in a mysterious place like Shinra Temple, Zhou Wen probably wouldn’t have taken a second look at it.</p>
<p>However, Tsukuyomi seemed to be looking at it very carefully, as though she was observing the patterns inch by inch.</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhou Wen had no intention of retreating, Unkilling Dugu frowned and said, “In that case, don’t blame me. Let me use the strongest Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light to send you away.”</p>
<p>As Unkilling Dugu spoke, his eyes suffused a golden glow. The golden glow became brighter and brighter before finally turning into a blazing white color.</p>
<p>At the same time, his body gradually fused with the divine light. It was as though only the pair of eyes that resembled blazing lamps hung in the air as they stared intently at Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>“He has already reached the Terror grade… He’s stronger than my family’s old hero back then. Perhaps it’s really as he said. That divine light might be able to wipe out souls. Quickly retreat,” the black-robed man said in horror.</p>
<p>However, just as the black-robed man finished speaking, he suddenly saw Tsukuyomi beside Zhou Wen move. She walked in the direction of the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light that illuminated the hall like it was daytime and walked towards Unkilling Dugu.</p>
<p>Unkilling Dugu was slightly taken aback when he saw this. However, he was still very confident in his Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light. He gathered all his strength and stared at Tsukuyomi with his blazing white eyes.</p>
<p>Back then, Nameless Dugu had relied on the Soul-Washing Divine Light to take his place among the six heroes. He had never encountered anyone who could match him. Back then, Nameless Dugu was only at the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Later on, when he was trapped in the Shinra Temple, his strength improved further over time. He had already advanced to the Terror grade. Now, with the addition of his powers, Unkilling Dugu refused to believe that this once invincible divine light couldn’t kill the young woman.</p>
<p>The Terror-grade Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light completely bloomed, turning into two beams of divine light that shone on Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>The black-robed man outside felt his heart turn cold. He originally wanted to use Zhou Wen’s strength to temporarily hold back Unkilling Dugu, but Zhou Wen had been too careless. The few of them had actually braved the attempt to withstand the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light, but there was no doubt about the destined outcome.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, the black-robed man’s pupils suddenly constricted as his mouth gaped open as though he had been petrified.</p>
<p>Unkilling Dugu’s Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light shone at Tsukuyomi. With a wave of Tsukuyomi’s hand, the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light immediately vanished. As for Unkilling Dugu, his body was sent flying as he slammed into the stone furnace. His golden armor shattered.</p>
<p>Blood spewed out of Unkilling Dugu’s mouth, but his face was filled with disbelief, finding what had happened utterly unbelievable.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1171'>Chapter 1171: Free Benefits</h3>
<p>“No way…” In a daze, the black-robed man stared at Unkilling Dugu, who struggled to get up to no avail. He found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>However, Tsukuyomi didn’t care about Unkilling Dugu at all. Her gaze was still fixed on the stone furnace. Unkilling Dugu, who was staggering as he stood up, blocked her vision again. Her eyes focused, causing Unkilling Dugu’s body to fly away and slam into a stone wall to the side. He smashed his head and died on the spot.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi ignored Unkilling Dugu’s death. Her gaze remained fixed on the stone furnace as she walked towards it step by step.</p>
<p>As Tsukuyomi walked towards the stone furnace, the originally simple and crude stone furnace began to tremble.</p>
<p>The dessicated corpse that was tied to the stone furnace turned to ashes. The chains also shattered. The patterns of the sun, moon, and stars emitted a strange black aura.</p>
<p>Everyone was attracted by the sudden turn of events, but Zhou Wen felt for his mysterious phone.</p>
<p>The mysterious phone vibrated violently as though it was about to jump out. Zhou Wen took it out and secretly took a look. Indeed, the Dead Man Tree was stirring.</p>
<p>Seeing everyone looking in the direction of the stone furnace, Zhou Wen took out his phone and snapped a picture of Unkilling Dugu’s corpse. Immediately, his corpse was stored into his phone and devoured by the Dead Man Tree.</p>
<p>A sprout finally grew from the Dead Man Tree that had been barren for a long time.</p>
<p>I never expected to benefit from nothing. Zhou Wen was delighted, but carrying Ya’er, he retreated with Chick.</p>
<p>There was a limit to Unkilling Dugu’s strength regardless of how strong he was; however, the stone furnace’s anomaly brought about unpredictable consequences. Zhou Wen didn’t dare take risks considering how this wasn’t in-game.</p>
<p>However, before Zhou Wen could leave the Shinra Temple, he heard a bang as the door closed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to teleport out, but he found himself slamming into some spatial barrier and bounced back.</p>
<p>“Tsukuyomi, what’s happening?” Zhou Wen had no choice but to turn to ask Tsukuyomi. She seemed to know what the stone furnace was.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi stared at the stone furnace and said, “There’s a powerful creature that doesn’t belong to Earth in that stone furnace.”</p>
<p>A powerful creature that doesn’t belong to Earth? Could it be a creature from the dimension? Zhou Wen’s expression turned solemn. To be called powerful by Tsukuyomi probably meant that it was not much weaker than her.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Ghost aura spewed out from the stone furnace like a volcanic eruption. Accompanying it was a figure who rose from the stone furnace.</p>
<p>It was an extremely ugly man. He wore black armor and emitted terrifying energy. Even with Zhou Wen’s present strength, he felt his heart palpitate when he sensed the man’s strength. He had goosebumps all over his arms.</p>
<p>It wasn’t fear, but a natural reaction to overwhelming power.</p>
<p>However, from the aura from his body, he was indeed somewhat different from the dimensional creatures born on Earth. His aura was somewhat similar to Ice Maiden’s. It was very likely that he came from the dimension.</p>
<p>However, according to what Zhou Wen knew, dimensional creatures that descended on Earth would be suppressed by Earth’s rules. It was impossible for them to maintain their Calamity-grade strength. Otherwise, dimensional creatures would have long invaded Earth.</p>
<p>“You actually dare disturb a king’s slumber. Do you have any idea of the consequences?” The terrifying creature floated above the stone furnace like a god that looked down on all living beings as it enunciated each word clearly.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi narrowed her eyes and looked at the dimensional creature. “This isn’t the dimension. It’s not a place you can call yourself king.”</p>
<p>The eyes of the dimensional creature moved slightly as he sized up Tsukuyomi. He said coldly, “You have suffered a lot by staying on Earth, haven’t you?”</p>
<p>“At least I don’t have to hide like a turtle,” Tsukuyomi said with a smile.</p>
<p>These words immediately infuriated the dimensional creature. Ghost aura erupted from his body like a tsunami.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi emitted a faint moonlight that shielded Zhou Wen and company behind her. The moonlight constantly clashed with the ghostly aura before silently annihilating it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t affected by the conflict behind Tsukuyomi, but he could still sense the horror of the clash between the moonlight and the ghostly aura.</p>
<p>He released Ice Maiden from the Chaos Bead and secretly asked her, “Ice Maiden, do you know who that is?”</p>
<p>Ice Maiden had been trapped in the Chaos Bead for ages. Although there was food and water inside that prevented her from starving to death, it was miserably boring. Just as she was about to berate Zhou Wen, she was alarmed by the dimensional creature she noticed from the corner of her eye. She didn’t have the time to blame Zhou Wen as she whispered, “How is he still alive?”</p>
<p>“Who is he?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked when he saw that Ice Maiden recognized the dimensional creature.</p>
<p>“Asura, the monarch of the Asura Clan, one of the Octokind,” Ice Maiden said with a heavy expression. “What is this place? Why is he here?”</p>
<p>“Asura Clan’s monarch? I remember you saying that among the Octokind, the monarchs of the Celestials and Dragons are the strongest. The others are weaker, right?” Zhou Wen felt a lot more at ease when he heard that.</p>
<p>Although Asura was strong, he was probably weaker than Di Tian, so he shouldn’t be too difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden read Zhou Wen’s mind and curled her lips. “The Di Tian you defeated was only a Body Cleansing Stone avatar. It’s hard to say how much strength he had. Furthermore, this Asura isn’t the Asura of the present Asura Clan. He’s the previous Asura. In ancient times, he once defeated Di Tian with martial strength. He also has another name—Not Heaven. Like Heaven, but Not Heaven.”</p>
<p>Ice Maiden paused for a moment before saying, “However, in ancient times, his true body descended to Earth and participated in the terrifying divine battle. Legend has it that he had long died in battle. Why is he here? What kind of place is this?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss when he heard that. He hurriedly explained the situation to Ice Maiden.</p>
<p>After Ice Maiden heard what had happened, her expression changed. After a while, she said, “Something’s wrong. There’s something wrong with this Not Heaven. Dimensional creatures will be suppressed by the rules on Earth. Unless they use the bodies of humans, they won’t be able to unleash Calamity grade powers. However, he isn’t attached to a human, but he can still release the power of a Calamity-grade. That leaves only one possibility.”</p>
<p>“What possibility?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“He has given up on the dimension and betrayed it,” Ice Maiden said.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>“It’s difficult to explain. All you need to understand now is that Not Heaven is already a traitor of the dimension. He definitely wouldn’t dare let the terrifying existences of the dimension discover him. Therefore, for us who know that he’s here…” Ice Maiden didn’t continue, but her meaning was very clear.</p>
<p>Not Heaven was bound to silence them; he definitely wouldn’t let them walk out alive.</p>

<p>Crack!</p>
<p>As the two of them spoke, Tsukuyomi took a step back and cracked the stone bricks on the ground.</p>
<p>The moonlight on her body dimmed significantly, but the ghostly aura on Not Heaven’s body intensified. It occupied most of Shinra Temple and continued to suppress the moonlight.</p>
<p>The moonlight on Tsukuyomi’s body was slowly shrinking under the suppression of the ghostly aura, causing Tsukuyomi’s body to involuntarily retreat.</p>
<p>Is Tsukuyomi not his match either? Zhou Wen’s expression changed slightly. He knew that what Ice Maiden had said was true. Not Heaven’s strength was indeed terrifying.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the antelope. It always acted mysteriously and had unfathomable strength. It was very likely a Calamity-grade existence. If it provided its help, the two Calamities might have a chance of defeating Not Heaven.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen nearly exploded from anger. That fellow was standing even further back than he was. He even wanted to use his horns to slam open the door. If not for Shinra Temple’s power imprisoning them here, it would have long fled.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that the antelope wasn’t reliable. It had charged faster than anyone when it sensed benefits ahead. Now that it had discovered danger, it also ran away faster than anyone else.</p>
<p>Seeing Tsukuyomi being increasingly suppressed to the point of slowly retreating, Zhou Wen knew that he had to do something.</p>
<p>He was only willing to use the Immortal Culling Sword as a last resort. The price of using it was too high, and it was very easy for him to be discovered by the dimension.</p>
<p>Asura had defected from the dimension while Zhou Wen’s identity as Human Sovereign was a secret.</p>
<p>Apart from the Immortal Culling Sword, what other powers are useful? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>He had the power of a Terror-grade but the effects of Terror-grade powers were very limited in front of a Calamity-grade.</p>
<p>Although it wasn’t the case that only a Calamity-grade could defeat a Calamity-grade, in front of the overwhelming strength of a Calamity-grade, a Terror-grade had no chance of approaching the other party.</p>
<p>Unless he could break through the Calamity domain and reach Not Heaven, Zhou Wen’s strength was useless against him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took in the present situation. Even Tsukuyomi’s Moonlight Domain couldn’t break through Not Heaven’s Calamity Zone, so it was even more impossible for him to rush over with his strength alone.</p>
<p>Since it’s impossible to rush over, is there a way to help Tsukuyomi? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Although Tsukuyomi’s power isn’t purely spatial, it definitely contains spatial powers. Can I transfer my power to her? It should be of some use, right? What if she’s just lacking a little? Zhou Wen was considering how he could transfer his power to Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>To transfer one’s strength to others was a special technique—it wasn’t something that could be done just because one wanted to.</p>
<p>Just the transmission of Essence Energy met with many restrictions. If one wasn’t careful, not only would the transmission of Essence Energy fail to help the other party, it might even injure them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen wanted to transmit spatial powers, making it even more problematic. Zhou Wen had never practiced such techniques in the past. After some thought, he couldn’t come up with a good solution.</p>
<p>The nine Demon Blood True Dragons can freely transmit their powers amongst themselves because their powers are one. As for Tsukuyomi’s power, it isn’t purely spatial. There might be some time or other attributes. If I rashly transmit the power of Clown Mask or Singularity Universe, I’m afraid it won’t be of any help. Instead, it will bring her harm. After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that this idea just wouldn’t work. He had to find another way.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s mind raced as he thought about how he could help Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>Wait… What kind of creature is Tsukuyomi? I wonder if the replication ability of the Demon God Body is effective on her? Zhou Wen had a crazy idea.</p>
<p>The Demon God Body could scan dimensional creatures and turn himself into a dimensional creature. However, typically speaking, it could only turn into a dimensional creature of a lower level or something not much higher.</p>
<p>The difficulty of transforming into a demon was the lowest. It was worse for other races, so transforming into a dimensional creature was more troublesome.</p>
<p>In theory, Tsukuyomi was also a dimensional creature born on Earth. He should be able to scan and replicate her. However, her level was too high. Furthermore, she was most likely not a demon.</p>
<p>It’s not realistic to completely transform into Tsukuyomi, but I can still give it a try. If I can achieve a certain level of assimilation and change my attributes to be like hers, I might be able to transfer my powers to her. Zhou Wen planned on giving it a try.</p>
<p>After being trapped in Fangzhang Mountain for a hundred years, Zhou Wen had done more research on the Demon God Bloodline Catalog. This was because he had a nagging feeling that the restrictions of the Demon God Transformation were too great. If he could lift the restrictions, he might be able to transform into any form at will, like the 72 Transformations in myths.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had many ideas regarding the Demon God Transformation, but due to his circumstances, they were limited to ideas. He didn’t know which ideas could be realized.</p>
<p>He would just have to give it a try and see how many of those ideas could be realized.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood not far behind Tsukuyomi. Now that Tsukuyomi was resisting Not Heaven with all her might, she naturally didn’t have the strength to care about anything else.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen engraved the Demon God Bloodline Catalog on his Wheel of Destiny. At the same time, his body changed. His eyes became abnormally demonic as though they were glowing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared at Tsukuyomi’s figure which reflected onto his eyes.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen realized that things weren’t as simple as he had imagined. Tsukuyomi’s level was too high, and her vital state was too different from his. The Demon God Body failed to obtain any detailed information while scanning Tsukuyomi’s body. All it gathered was some superficial information.</p>
<p>The information could only change Zhou Wen’s appearance, making him look like Tsukuyomi, but it was useless. It was just a change in appearance that wasn’t much different from an illusion. It had no practical use.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen made a few attempts, but none of them worked. The difference in life’s natural order was too great, so it was impossible for him to scan and replicate it.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was feeling disappointed, he suddenly realized that the Demon God Eyes had passed through Tsukuyomi’s body and obtained her data. Furthermore, it was extremely detailed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood that Tsukuyomi knew what she was doing and had taken the initiative to open up her body to him. Otherwise, even if she wasn’t guarding against him, it would have been difficult for him to obtain her stats.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he circulated the Demon God Bloodline Catalog with all his might. His body gradually changed.</p>
<p>No… It still won’t work… Although I have Tsukuyomi’s data, it’s still too much of a burden for me to replicate such data. Unless the Demon God Bloodline Catalog can improve further… Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and made repeated derivations. He also constantly changed the engravings of the Demon God Bloodline Catalog.</p>
<p>As the engravings deepened, the Demon God Chart that Zhou Wen engraved became even more demonic.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter1173'>Chapter 1173: You’re Right</h3>
<p>The Demon God Chart on the Wheel of Destiny increasingly resembled Zhou Wen, but Zhou Wen’s body was becoming more and more like Tsukuyomi. This wasn’t just a change in appearance, even his Essence Energy attribute was beginning to change towards Tsukuyomi’s.</p>
<p>However, because Tsukuyomi’s order in life was too high, Zhou Wen wasn’t able to completely replicate it. He focused on replicating Tsukuyomi’s Essence Energy attribute, so his body wasn’t completely the same as Tsukuyomi’s.</p>
<p>However, when the symbol on the Wheel of Destiny completely transformed into Zhou Wen’s appearance, the Demon God Body instantly broke through some restrictions and transformed into a state identical to Tsukuyomi’s. The two of them were like twins. Even Monkey Sun with his fiery eyes and golden pupils probably couldn’t tell the difference.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his palm and pressed it on Tsukuyomi’s back, injecting his Essence Energy into her body.</p>
<p>Now, his Essence Energy attribute was identical to Tsukuyomi’s. He directly injected it into her body like water entering the ocean. It directly fused with hers without causing any discomfort.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen was only an ordinary Terror-grade, his Essence Energy would be useless at helping a Calamity-grade.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had Slaughterer’s massive amounts of Essence Energy and the Heaven-Opening Scripture’s ultra-fast recovery of Essence Energy. The combination of the Essence Energy output and the fact that his body had turned into Tsukuyomi’s Calamity body had quite an effect on the Calamity-grade Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was far inferior to a Calamity-grade in every other aspect, but in terms of Essence Energy, he was able to be of some use.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi’s Moonlight Domain brightened significantly. Although she didn’t turn the tides, she stabilized the situation. Not Heaven’s ghostly aura didn’t continue its domination.</p>
<p>“Interesting…” Not only was Not Heaven not angry, but he also sized up Zhou Wen with interest.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s support, Tsukuyomi only stabilized the situation. Furthermore, Not Heaven’s Calamity Domain was constantly growing stronger.</p>
<p>“He seems to be able to use the power of this palace. There’s no chance of defeating him here. Think of a way to rush out.” Ice Maiden saw the problem and told Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally noticed as well, but if he could escape, he would have long done so. Why would he wait until now?</p>
<p>Even Tsukuyomi couldn’t rush out of a god-forsaken place like the Shinra Temple, let alone him.</p>
<p>As time passed, the ghostly aura once again suppressed the Moonlight Domain. As for Zhou Wen, he had to keep up his transformation and inject Essence Energy into Tsukuyomi. He was already at his limits.</p>
<p>“What’s your name?” Not Heaven suddenly looked at Tsukuyomi and asked.</p>
<p>“Tsukuyomi.” Tsukuyomi asked, “And who are you?”</p>
<p>“Not Heaven.” Not Heaven reported his name and continued, “I’ve been asleep for too long. I never expected to encounter such a powerful creature the moment I woke up. How many existences like you are on Earth?”</p>
<p>“Why should I answer you?” Tsukuyomi said indifferently.</p>
<p>Not Heaven didn’t get angry and continued, “Based on your strength, there should be quite a number of Calamity-grade creatures on Earth. If I leave the Shinra Temple, with you guys as cover, I might not be discovered. Therefore, there’s no need for us to fight to the death.”</p>
<p>“And then?” Tsukuyomi knew that it wasn’t that Not Heaven wanted a truce. Otherwise, he could have stopped at any time, considering how he had already gained the absolute advantage.</p>
<p>“I want this human. You can take the rest away. Shall we end this?” Not Heaven pointed at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“No,” Tsukuyomi said directly.</p>
<p>“I know what you want from him. Don’t worry, I have a solution. Since he doesn’t agree, we can also let the token do its job and let you complete the contract. You can stay on Earth without any restrictions,” Not Heaven said again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat. He knew that the reason Tsukuyomi hadn’t attacked him was because of the Heavenly Happiness Token. If Not Heaven could do what he claimed, would Tsukuyomi have any qualms about protecting him?</p>
<p>“That thing can’t be contracted by force,” Tsukuyomi said.</p>
<p>“Of course it can’t be resolved by force. However, back when I was in the dimension, I once heard from an Apocalyptic existence that there’s a way to reach a contract without the permission of the owner,” Not Heaven said. “When the time comes, I’ll get the person and you can take the token. We’ll get what we need, so why fight with our lives?”</p>
<p>“What method?” Tsukuyomi asked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that things were going south. With Tsukuyomi around, he still had a chance of turning the tables. If Tsukuyomi allied with Not Heaven, he would probably die today.</p>
<p>Even if he could pull out the Immortal Culling Sword again, the single sword wouldn’t be able to kill two Calamity-grade creatures.</p>
<p>“The method is a little complicated, but as long as you agree to withdraw, I can help you complete the contract and let you obtain that token,” Not Heaven said.</p>
<p>This condition was extremely tempting. If Zhou Wen was Tsukuyomi, he really couldn’t think of a reason to reject it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen retracted his palm and left his transformed state, allowing his Essence Energy to recover. At the same time, he secretly held the Immortal Culling Sword. He was already prepared to give his all.</p>
<p>“What if I don’t agree?” Tsukuyomi’s words left Zhou Wen slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>Not Heaven said indifferently, “I doubt you will make such a choice. You have stayed on Earth for too long and your body has been severely damaged. There’s no chance of you defeating me.”</p>
<p>“That might not be the case,” Tsukuyomi said calmly.</p>
<p>“If you forcefully break through the restrictions, you can definitely unleash all your combat strength. It’s hard to say if you can defeat me, but if that’s the case, you will definitely be forced to leave Earth in an extremely short period of time. When that happens, it’s useless even if you have a token. This isn’t what you want. You helped him because you wanted to borrow the power of that token to stay on Earth. Since this is impossible, is there any point in helping him?” Not Heaven smiled and said, “If you cooperate with me, you can stay on Earth without being restrained by him. There are only benefits, so why not? Could it be that you are really willing to leave Earth like this? I think you should know that doing so is almost a path of certain death. If you are willing to take that path, you won’t have to suffer by staying by a human’s side all the time, isn’t that so?”</p>
<p>“You’re right.” Tsukuyomi nodded slightly and turned to look at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart tightened as he gripped the Immortal Culling Sword he had taken out. At this point, he could fight it out.</p>
<p>“In that case, give him to me. I’ll help you complete the contract. We’ll take what we each need.” Not Heaven seemed to be confident of victory as he wanted to grab Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>However, a terrifying force pushed Not Heaven back. Tsukuyomi’s body glowed brightly as moonlight swirled around her. It constantly distorted space, making her look beautiful and demonic.</p>
<p>“You’re right, but I don’t like it,” Tsukuyomi said coldly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1174'>Chapter 1174: It’s Meaningless</h3>
<p>“Do you know what it means to completely release the power of the Calamity domain here?” Not Heaven looked at Tsukuyomi in puzzlement. He really didn’t understand why Tsukuyomi was doing this. It didn’t benefit her at all.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also looked at Tsukuyomi in puzzlement. He never expected her to choose to stand on his side under such circumstances.</p>
<p>“I know the consequences better than you.” As Tsukuyomi spoke, the moonlight on her body became even brighter. The moonlight formed halos that sliced the space around her into many distorted domains.</p>
<p>In the domains, terrifying ghosts appeared. There was Yuki Onna, Hashihime, Daitengu, and Umibōzu, who Zhou Wen was familiar with. There were also many ghosts that Zhou Wen had never seen before.</p>
<p>Instantly, the entire Shinra Temple was filled with ghosts. It was as if it had become a Moonlit Ghost Domain.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen could tell that the ghosts weren’t the real Yuki Onna or Daitengu. They were just illusions.</p>
<p>However, the illusions looked extremely real. The ghosts surrounded Tsukuyomi like they were escorting royalty as they majestically marched towards Not Heaven’s Calamity Domain.</p>
<p>The Calamity Domain that could suppress the Moonlight Domain was now suppressed by the moonlight. As the Ghost Parade entourage advanced, the ghostly aura domain shrank even more.</p>
<p>The moment the illusory Night Parade of One Hundred Demons touched Not Heaven’s domain, it immediately devoured the ghostly aura in his domain.</p>
<p>“Are you crazy? With such explosive strength, you will soon be expelled from Earth… Asura Battlefield…” Not Heaven didn’t have the time to finish his sentence. Tsukuyomi’s Ghost Parade was too ferocious. He had no choice but to deal with it with all his might.</p>
<p>Not Heaven’s surroundings turned into an Asura Battlefield domain. There seemed to be countless terrifying Asura Battle Souls roaring and fighting inside.</p>
<p>While the two domains clashed, the power that erupted was unimaginably terrifying. As for the Asura Battlefield domain, it was being devoured by the Ghost Parade domain, becoming smaller and smaller.</p>
<p>Not Heaven’s expression was extremely nasty. He used all his strength to withstand Tsukuyomi’s domain, but the ghostly aura on his body weakened as he constantly retreated.</p>
<p>“Tsukuyomi, are you really not afraid of being expelled from Earth?” Not Heaven shouted as he tried his best to resist Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>There was only a tiny area left of the Asura Battlefield domain around him, and it was just moments before it was completely devoured. Not Heaven used all his strength to barely hold on, slowing down the speed at which the domain was devoured.</p>
<p>The moonlight on Tsukuyomi’s body became weaker and weaker. She was about to turn into light. She was like a goddess on the moon. Her clothes fluttered with moonlight.</p>
<p>Something’s amiss! Zhou Wen looked at the extremely powerful Tsukuyomi and felt an abnormal power fluctuation.</p>
<p>A strange force gradually appeared on Tsukuyomi’s body. It seemed to be pulling her body, pulling her into the endless void.</p>
<p>“Tsukuyomi, how do you use this token?” Zhou Wen took out the Heavenly Happiness Token and shouted at Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had roughly guessed that the power that wanted to pull Tsukuyomi into the infinite void was the repulsive force that Not Heaven had mentioned.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen didn’t know why a powerful existence like Tsukuyomi would die if she left Earth, he didn’t wish for her to leave Earth.</p>
<p>The Heavenly Happiness Token was useless to Zhou Wen. If he could save Tsukuyomi and make her stay, he wouldn’t mind using it now.</p>
<p>“There’s no need.” Tsukuyomi didn’t turn around or take the Heavenly Happiness Token. She only said indifferently, “What will come will come. It’s meaningless to take something that doesn’t belong to me.”</p>
<p>“You’re mad.” The Asura Domain around Not Heaven’s body was about to collapse. He tried his best to resist Tsukuyomi, but the Asura Battlefield domain kept shrinking.</p>
<p>However, Not Heaven’s eyes remained firm as steel as he stared at Tsukuyomi and said, “You have no chance. Before you defeat me, you will be expelled from Earth…”</p>
<p>Not Heaven wasn’t being an alarmist. Tsukuyomi’s entire body was about to turn into moonlight, and the force that was pulling her had already reached her head. It wasn’t affected by her domain at all. Like a black hole that devoured everything, it wanted to devour Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>“Tsukuyomi, this token is meaningless to me. If you need it, I can cooperate with you to complete the contract,” Zhou Wen said again.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi suddenly turned her head and smiled brightly at Zhou Wen. “If it’s meaningless to you, it’s meaningless to me as well. When it’s meaningful, you can use it to find me.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Tsukuyomi, unsure what she meant.</p>
<p>In the next second, Tsukuyomi turned her head and infinite moonlight erupted from her body. Her entire body completely turned into light as the pure moonlight instantly shattered everything.</p>
<p>Moon—a pure moon. Under the moonlight, everything was purified.</p>
<p>The illusory Hundred Ghosts vanished in the moonlight. The Asura Battlefield also turned to ashes. Not Heaven let out a tragic cry as his body dissipated in the moonlight as though he had melted into it.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The stone furnace in Shinra Temple was shattered by the moonlight and turned to dust.</p>
<p>Moonlight filled everyone’s vision, but in the next second, the moon was devoured by the void and instantly vanished.</p>
<p>The moonlight dissipated and Shinra Temple returned to normal. However, there was no sign of Tsukuyomi or Not Heaven. Everything seemed so unreal.</p>
<p>“Tsukuyomi!” Zhou Wen held the Heavenly Happiness Token in his hand as he looked at the spot where Tsukuyomi had vanished with a complicated expression. His face was filled with puzzlement, perplexity, shame, and indignation.</p>
<p>He was ashamed for doubting Tsukuyomi, and he didn’t understand why she had made such a choice. He had already agreed to cooperate with her to use the Heavenly Happiness Token, so why had she given up?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen still didn’t fully understand Tsukuyomi’s final words.</p>
<p>If an Essence Energy Art or Essence Energy Skill were placed in front of Zhou Wen, no matter how difficult it was, he could find a pattern to resolve it. However, there were some things that had no pattern. This was something Zhou Wen wasn’t good at.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was still in a daze, he suddenly saw a stone furnace fragment on the ground. Ghost aura rose out of it as the Ghost aura gradually condensed into Not Heaven’s body, allowing him to reappear.</p>
<p>He’s not dead? Zhou Wen’s expression changed drastically as he gripped the Immortal Culling Sword tightly.</p>
<p>Not Heaven’s body walked out of the demonic aura again as he looked coldly at Zhou Wen and said, “Unfortunately, she failed to kill me. No one can save you now. If you are obedient, you can suffer less. Otherwise…”</p>
<p>Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>Before Not Heaven could finish his sentence, two hooves suddenly descended from the sky and struck his head, smashing him to the ground.</p>
<p>Not Heaven sprawled on the ground and was dumbfounded when he saw an antelope descend from the sky and shatter the stone furnace that emitted a demonic aura.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1175'>Chapter 1175: Orphan</h3>
<p>Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>Before Not Heaven could react, the antelope stomped down again. Not Heaven’s head exploded as blood and brain matter splattered everywhere.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was dumbfounded as he stared blankly at the antelope. He felt as though curses were running through his mind.</p>
<p>Not Heaven didn’t revive this time. He could not be any more dead. With his death, the power that sealed Shinra Temple vanished and it returned to its original state.</p>
<p>“F*ck, if you could kill him, why didn’t you… stomp down earlier…” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but question the antelope.</p>
<p>The antelope glanced at him and said disdainfully, “Do you think he’s that easy to kill? If Tsukuyomi hadn’t severely injured him, I’m afraid all of you would have died here. It’s only because he had been suppressed for so long that his strength was far from its peak.”</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t have been difficult to defeat him if you had joined forces with Tsukuyomi, right? Why did hold out, forcing Tsukuyomi to leave Earth?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it the same? There’s no difference. Anyway, Tsukuyomi had to leave. It’s something that was bound to happen sooner or later. If you want to blame someone, blame yourself for not retaining her.” The antelope curled its lips and walked out of the Shinra Temple.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at Not Heaven’s corpse on the ground. It looked very similar to a human’s corpse.</p>
<p>When Tsukuyomi was around, Zhou Wen had thought of all sorts of methods, hoping to escape her and let her leave Earth early. But now that she was gone, Zhou Wen felt a little odd.</p>
<p>When he walked out of Shinra Temple, he realized that there were already many people outside. They were likely members of the Dugu family. The leader was a person with white hair, but his face made it appear as though he was thirty. He was likely the hero of the Dugu family, Nameless Dugu.</p>
<p>Of course, this was only one of the two Nameless Dugu. Zhou Wen didn’t know if he was the elder or younger brother.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s guess was right. It was Nameless Dugu. He walked into Shinra Temple alone and took Zhou Wen to a secret chamber in the Dugu family.</p>
<p>“Brother Zhou, I believe you have already learned about my brother,” said Nameless Dugu with a sigh.</p>
<p>“Yes, a little, but I’m not too sure of the details. Furthermore, I’m not interested in these things, so I won’t shoot my mouth. All I want to know now is where Worm Dugu is.” Zhou Wen made his stance clear.</p>
<p>Nameless Dugu continued, “Qianqiu and I were twins. It was an era of foolishness. In our village, twins were an ominous symbol, just like Gu. In a Gu container, only one poisonous bug can survive to the end and turn into a Gu. As long as a second one is alive, they will continue fighting. Therefore, when we were born, the elders in the family wanted to drown one of the babies.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps he wasn’t destined to die. The drowning baby was accidentally saved by someone and luckily survived.” Nameless Dugu told a very long story.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally didn’t care about the Dugu family’s matters, but as he listened, he couldn’t help but be attracted by the story.</p>
<p>He wasn’t interested in the love and hate between the two brothers, but later, Nameless Dugu mentioned their entry into the Holy Land.</p>
<p>The two brothers had entered the Trajectory Holy Temple. Zhou Wen had also entered the temple and experienced many strange things there.</p>
<p>The Ah Lai that Li Xuan had taken in had come out of the Trajectory Holy Temple. However, there was no such person among the people who had entered the Holy Land.</p>
<p>The Dugu brothers’ encounter in the Trajectory Holy Temple was equally bizarre. However, after they entered the Trajectory Holy Temple, they didn’t see each other despite being inside.</p>
<p>Nameless Dugu only knew what he had experienced in the Trajectory Holy Temple. He had only heard what his younger brother had experienced later. However, he was unable to determine the truth.</p>
<p>However, ever since they had left the Trajectory Holy Temple, his younger brother no longer showed his true face to others. Furthermore, he had convinced Nameless Dugu to share the same identity—Nameless Dugu, one of the six heroes of the Federation.</p>
<p>Nameless Dugu was good at movement techniques, but not only was his younger brother good at movement techniques, he also had the ability to use the Soul-Washing Divine Light. He had even broken through to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Nameless Dugu originally imagined that his brother was talented, but he later learned that it was because his brother had signed some agreement in the Trajectory Holy Temple and obtained the help of the Holy Temple that he absorbed a Guardian to advance to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>“After leaving the Trajectory Holy Temple, my brother’s actions became weirder and weirder. Furthermore, many of the things he did were incomprehensible to me. I secretly paid attention to him. Later, I realized that he secretly nurtured many orphans.” When Nameless Dugu said that, he wore a strange expression.</p>
<p>“What’s so special about those orphans?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>“In the beginning, there wasn’t anything special. I thought that he only wanted to nurture a faction that belonged to him, so I didn’t take it to heart. However, as those orphans grew up, I gradually discovered something extremely terrifying.” Nameless Dugu’s expression was extremely complicated. It was indescribable.</p>
<p>“What happened to those orphans?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked. He was also very curious.</p>
<p>“Nothing happened to the orphans. They were very normal. The abnormality was with the Federation,” said Nameless Dugu.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was infuriated when he heard that. He thought to himself, Can’t you finish what happened in one go?</p>
<p>Nameless Dugu continued with a strange expression, “In the beginning, I didn’t pay too much attention to it. Later, the Federation developed very smoothly. Stabilizing our families and expelling those devils were many things that we needed to do. However, I’d never seen my brother use the orphans he raised. I found it odd. After spending so much time and effort to nurture so many orphans, it’s definitely impossible for him to just keep them without doing anything. However, twenty to thirty years have passed. I’ve never seen those orphans appear. Don’t you think it’s strange?”</p>
<p>“Could it be that he has secretly sent them away without your knowledge?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“That’s what I thought too, so I went to take a look again. The orphans were still there, and not only had their numbers not dropped, but there were even more. Some of them had already grown up, while some were still children. The oldest were in their thirties or forties, and the youngest were only a few months old. When I saw the faces of the older ones, I was stunned.” Nameless Dugu seemed to sink into his memories as he revealed a look of lingering fear.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wished he could tear open the top of Nameless Dugu’s head to see what was on his mind.</p>
<p>Without making Zhou Wen wait too long, Nameless Dugu continued, “Those few people’s faces were very similar to many of the famous people in the Federation back then. I wouldn’t just call it similar, but identical. Those people were top figures in the various fields of the Federation. Some were experts in certain areas, while others were Senators of the Senate…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt his blood run cold when he heard that, but it also rang a bell.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1176'>Chapter 1176: The Invisible Hand</h3>
<p>“Those people just changed their looks, right?” Zhou Wen asked with an odd expression.</p>
<p>Nameless Dugu shook his head and said, “I thought so too at the beginning, but I quickly realized that it wasn’t the case. Those orphans had those faces from the very beginning. They did not undergo any plastic surgery. They naturally had those looks.”</p>
<p>“That’s impossible…” Zhou Wen felt a chill run down his spine.</p>
<p>If it was plastic surgery, it would be understandable. It was simply producing certain people via operating.</p>
<p>However, if they hadn’t undergone plastic surgery, how could Dugu Qianqiu be sure that they would look identical to a certain important figure when they grew up?</p>
<p>“I thought it impossible as well, but ever since then, I’ve been secretly paying attention to those orphans. I realized that as long as the orphan existed, I would be able to find a corresponding person of status outside. Even if they weren’t to be found, they were bound to appear in the future. Among them, there were a few orphans who didn’t have a corresponding person of status when they were young. However, when they grew up, there were people who looked like them who rose to prominence…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen became increasingly horrified. He tried his best to think of a reasonable possibility. “Could it be that your brother raised twins separately and supported one of them to become a person of status while raising the other in the orphanage?”</p>
<p>“Among those famous people, there were many of them who were members of the six families. Do you think it’s possible to obtain so many twins?” Nameless Dugu asked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and found it a little unrealistic. How could he get so many twins? Furthermore, all of them became famous eventually. Even an elite academy couldn’t guarantee that everyone that passed through their gates would become elites, much less raise so many twins. It was too difficult to guarantee that all of them would become top figures in different fields.</p>
<p>However, other than that, Zhou Wen really couldn’t think of any other reasonable explanation. To raise orphans from a young age and have famous people who resembled these orphans after they reached adulthood, there were only two possibilities. If they weren’t twins, could it be that Dugu Qianqiu had the ability to predict the future?</p>
<p>Were the experts from the former principal’s expedition team replaced by these orphans? The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he found it strange. He asked, “Among those orphans, was there an expert named Chu He…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen recounted the situation regarding the experts in the expedition team, hoping to know if the expedition team had been replaced by the orphans.</p>
<p>“Probably,” said Nameless Dugu after some thought.</p>
<p>“What do you mean probably?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>Nameless Dugu sighed and said, “After I discovered this secret, I thought of a way to secretly restrain Qianqiu and imprison him. I wanted to know the details from him, but he refused to say a word. After I imprisoned him, I went to the orphanage, hoping to bring back the orphans, but I realized that the orphanage had been burned to ashes. The orphans were also gone. They were nowhere to be seen. No corpses were found, and I never saw them again.”</p>
<p>“Your brother had been imprisoned in Shinra Temple ever since?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.</p>
<p>“Yes, I didn’t know what crazy things he was plotting, so I didn’t release him,” said Nameless Dugu.</p>
<p>“When was that?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“Forty years ago.” Nameless Dugu gave a rough number.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen did some calculations. Among the experts, there were young professors in their twenties to their seventies. It was difficult to infer anything from the time.</p>
<p>“You never saw those orphans again?” Zhou Wen had too many questions on his mind.</p>
<p>“No. Even if I did, I wouldn’t be able to recognize them,” Nameless Dugu gave an odd answer.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen understood what he meant. If the orphans appeared as impersonations, he wouldn’t be able to tell them apart.</p>
<p>“Your brother didn’t say a word despite being imprisoned for so many years?” Zhou Wen wanted to get to the bottom of things.</p>
<p>“No, he didn’t say anything. No matter how I tried to get it out of him, he kept mum. However, according to my observations, this matter has something to do with the Trajectory Holy Temple,” said Nameless Dugu.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that it made sense. All the anomalies had begun after Dugu Qianqiu returned from the Trajectory Holy Temple. There was no way Zhou Wen would believe that this matter had nothing to do with the Trajectory Holy Temple.</p>
<p>Nameless Dugu continued, “Later on, I also sent quite a number of disciples from the Dugu family into the Trajectory Holy Temple, but they didn’t gain anything. Or perhaps they obtained something without my knowledge.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew what Nameless Dugu was worried about. He also didn’t know if the Dugu family had such an orphan or if someone had long been replaced.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found it terrifying just thinking about it. A person who had a very good relationship with his family and friends was suddenly swapped without anyone knowing. It was a terrifying idea.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the people who were replaced by the orphans were basically experts and top talents in various fields.</p>
<p>Just the thought of it sent a chill down Zhou Wen’s spine.</p>
<p>Nameless Dugu mentioned a few more matters, some pertaining to Unkilling Dugu. He was a genius, a rare genius of the Dugu family. Unfortunately, his Life Providence was the God of Unkilling, so he could only remain ordinary.</p>
<p>However, geniuses were unwilling to be ordinary. That was why Unkilling Dugu had tried his best to resolve the problem of his Life Providence. For some reason, Unkilling Dugu learned of Dugu Qianqiu and even communicated with him. He took advantage of the Dugu family’s grand ceremony to rush into the Shinra Temple to inherit Dugu Qianqiu’s power.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gained a rough understanding of all that had happened, but he became even more puzzled.</p>
<p>According to what Nameless Dugu had said, those orphans were nurtured by Dugu Qianqiu. However, Dugu Qianqiu had been imprisoned here for so many years. Who was controlling those babies behind the scenes?</p>
<p>Trajectory Holy Temple, Dugu Qianqiu, orphans, expedition team… What’s the connection? Zhou Wen felt as though an invisible hand was secretly controlling everything.</p>
<p>The Dugu family used special means to quickly contact Worm Dugu. Thankfully, Li Xuan was with him.</p>
<p>Upon hearing that Zhou Wen was looking for him, Li Xuan said that he would rush back immediately and requested Zhou Wen to wait for him for two days.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen couldn’t afford to wait. After asking where Li Xuan and company were, he used spatial teleportation to rush over.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it wasn’t too far away. Even without Tsukuyomi, Zhou Wen could still teleport over with Ya’er and company. However, he needed them to enter the Chaos Bead first.</p>
<p>After meeting Li Xuan at the designated location, he realized that Li Xuan hadn’t changed much. He still appeared frivolous, but he physically looked more mature.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, it’s been five years, but you still aren’t as handsome as me.” Li Xuan walked over and hugged Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that Li Xuan’s aura was very strange. It was different from the creatures he had seen in the past, but it wasn’t purely human. However, he was certain that Li Xuan was very strong.</p>
<p>“I need your help,” Zhou Wen said to Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Let’s go,” Li Xuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>“It’s very dangerous. It might cost you your life. Give it some thought,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Since you came to me, it means that I’m the only one who can do this, isn’t that so?” Li Xuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>“I still have a backup plan,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Enough of that. It’s not like I don’t understand you. Let’s go,” Li Xuan said with a smile.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1177'>Chapter 1177: Returning to Netherworld City</h3>
<p>A strange ancient city stood in the sandstorm. Outside the ancient city’s entrance was a group of soldiers. One of them was a cold-looking officer who was sizing up the ancient city with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>“Overseer, Charlie Team has already exited the city, but nothing was discovered.” A soldier’s report made the officer’s expression turn colder.</p>
<p>After An Tianzuo arrived at Netherworld City, he had immediately sent four teams to explore it in batches. According to the experience and data he had obtained, three teams had successfully cleared Netherworld City, but they hadn’t brought good news.</p>
<p>Although there were many of the living dead in Netherworld City—people who didn’t even know that they were dead and were being tortured day after day—Ouyang Lan and the accompanying soldiers hadn’t been found.</p>
<p>“Overseer, it looks like Young Master Wen is right. Madam and the rest might have entered the true Netherworld. We need to experience all the punishments before we can open the true entrance to the Netherworld,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo glanced at the officers and soldiers behind him. At this point, there was only one possibility left.</p>
<p>However, the punishments in Netherworld City weren’t something anyone could withstand. Even someone as powerful as him couldn’t withstand all the punishments in a day.</p>
<p>Apart from the fact that his body couldn’t withstand it, time was also a critical problem.</p>
<p>There were three ironclad rules in Netherworld City. Those who committed murder would die, and those whose feet left the ground would die. One had to kill one person every day they entered the city, or they would die.</p>
<p>There was an unresolvable contradiction, so one had to leave Netherworld City within a day. Otherwise, no matter how powerful an existence was, they would be killed by the taboo power of Netherworld City.</p>
<p>One had to experience all 239 punishments in a day. Even if one’s body could withstand it, there wasn’t enough time.</p>
<p>As powerful as An Tianzuo was, and he had countless capable people under him, no one could fulfill this condition.</p>
<p>“If Delta Team returns with nothing, we will enter the city,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>An Sheng whispered, “Overseer, should we wait for Young Master Wen? He’s gone to look for Li Xuan. He should be here soon.”</p>
<p>“There’s no time to waste. Every minute we wait means one less chance of survival for my mom and the others,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“But if Young Master Wen isn’t around, I’m afraid we won’t be able to withstand all the punishments in a day,” An Sheng reminded.</p>
<p>“Commander Lu, you have already seen the punishments in Netherworld City. What are your thoughts about them?” An Tianzuo asked an officer from Charlie Team.</p>
<p>The officer was fair and chubby. He had a smile on his face as his eyes narrowed into slits. He looked harmless.</p>
<p>However, from his figure, he was at least two hundred kilograms. He was almost the shape of a ball. In this era, there weren’t many people who could be this fat.</p>
<p>Commander Lu’s name was Lu Bushun, or literally ‘awry.’ As for why his parents gave him such a name, it was not something outsiders would know.</p>
<p>Upon hearing An Tianzuo call him out, Lu Bushun moved his body and took a step forward. He raised his arm with great difficulty and gave a military salute. He widened his eyes and said, “Overseer, I’ve tried a few types of punishments. Those punishments can ignore the defenses of the body. Even a Mythical power can’t withstand them. The only thing that’s effective is a body’s self-healing abilities. As you know, Overseer, this is my specialty. As long as there’s enough time, it won’t be difficult for me to withstand all the punishments.”</p>
<p>An Tianzuo nodded slightly and looked at another young officer. “Jingyu, what about you?”</p>
<p>An Jingyu was a few years younger than An Tianzuo. He was an expert that had risen from the An family in recent years. He was extremely talented and his strength was temporal in nature, a rare power.</p>
<p>Although An Tianzuo had once had an unhappy relationship with the An family’s elders, he was still the leader of the An family’s current generation. He still spared no effort to nurture the youths who had a chance of success.</p>
<p>An Jingyu was one of the young members of the An family that he valued the most. He had brought him along this time.</p>
<p>Although according to the family hierarchy, An Jingyu should address An Tianzuo as Uncle, he could only salute obediently in military fashion. “Overseer, I’ve already tried. I can use time acceleration to accelerate the punishment. As long as Commander Lu can withstand it, I’m confident that I can make him suffer all the punishments in twenty-four hours.”</p>
<p>An Tianzuo nodded slightly and didn’t question further. He said to An Sheng, “Make the preparations. We’ll enter the city once Delta Team comes out.”</p>
<p>Since he was here, he was naturally prepared. He didn’t come blindly.</p>
<p>It wasn’t An Sheng’s place to say anything else. He also knew that what An Tianzuo said made sense. Every minute wasted meant less hope for Ouyang Lan and company.</p>
<p>However, he had a nagging feeling that there was a huge problem with Netherworld City. If he could wait for Zhou Wen to come along, their chances would be higher.</p>
<p>However, now that they had reached the point of no return, they had no choice. This was because he didn’t know when Zhou Wen would arrive. It was impossible for them to keep waiting.</p>
<p>An Sheng could only pray that Zhou Wen would arrive early, but Zhou Wen hadn’t arrived by the time Delta Team exited the city.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo personally chose the candidates to enter Netherworld City with him. Including him and An Sheng, there were a total of sixteen people. These sixteen people might not be the strongest in the An family and the Sunset Army, but they each had their own unique abilities. They might be of use when facing different problems.</p>
<p>“Prepare to set off.” An Tianzuo didn’t wish to delay any further.</p>
<p>“Ah, Overseer, please wait. I’ve left something important in the camp. I’ll go get it now. I’ll be back soon.” An Sheng smiled apologetically as he ran towards the tent.</p>
<p>What should I do? This is killing me. Why isn’t Young Master Wen here yet? Inside the tent, An Sheng was like an ant on a hot pan. He knew that this trip was very dangerous. If they could wait for Zhou Wen, they would have a higher chance of survival.</p>
<p>An Sheng circled the tent a few times, hoping to stall for more time, but he heard An Tianzuo’s voice from outside. “Adjutant An, if I don’t see you in three seconds, you can forget about going.”</p>
<p>“I’m coming!” An Sheng could only leave the tent with a bitter expression. As he walked towards An Tianzuo, he held his stomach and walked especially slowly as though he was in pain.</p>
<p>When he finally came close to An Tianzuo, An Sheng said, “Overseer, I need to relieve myself. I want to use the bathroom…”</p>
<p>“Go,” An Tianzuo said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Overseer…” An Sheng was delighted. He could stall for time again.</p>
<p>To his surprise, An Tianzuo added, “You don’t have to come back if you go. Just return to Luoyang.”</p>
<p>“Overseer, I don’t think it’s a big deal,” An Sheng immediately said as he stood up.</p>
<p>“Can we leave now?” An Tianzuo asked An Sheng.</p>
<p>“As long as Overseer says so.” An Sheng stood straight and answered without looking sideways.</p>
<p>“Let’s set off.” An Tianzuo glanced in the direction of the desert, but it was only for an instant. He quickly retracted his gaze and firmly walked towards the entrance of Netherworld City.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen!” An Sheng followed An Tianzuo towards Netherworld City. Just as they were about to reach the door, An Sheng looked back and was immediately overjoyed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1178'>Chapter 1178: Saw Punishment</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>An Tianzuo and company turned around and followed An Sheng’s gaze. Indeed, they saw Zhou Wen walking out of the desert with Ya’er in his arms.</p>
<p>Beside him was the grinning, cheeky Li Xuan. On the other side was a white antelope and a flying golden eagle.</p>
<p>He made it! An Sheng secretly heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen quickly walked over. Although he and An Tianzuo thought little of each other, they shared the same stand when it came to saving Ouyang Lan.</p>
<p>“Why did you bring Ya’er here? Don’t you know how dangerous this place is?” An Tianzuo frowned when he saw Zhou Wen carrying Ya’er over.</p>
<p>“She’s the safest with me,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>Their gazes met in the air. An Sheng had an illusion that there were sparks flashing where their gazes met.</p>
<p>“If anything happens to Ya’er, I won’t let you off easily. Let’s go,” An Tianzuo said coldly before turning around and walking towards Netherworld City.</p>
<p>Everyone followed An Tianzuo through the gates of Netherworld City. An Sheng stayed behind him and waved at Zhou Wen, gesturing for him to follow quickly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan exchanged looks before walking towards Netherworld City.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had already been to Netherworld City once and had cleared it countless times in-game, he was still somewhat nervous when he came here again.</p>
<p>City Lord Netherworld, who could toy with the dead, left a very deep impression on him. Even though he already had the power of a Terror-grade, he still found City Lord Netherworld extremely terrifying when he thought about it.</p>
<p>At the instant he entered the gates of Netherworld City, his body seemed to traverse spacetime. When he finished taking the step, he was already standing on the long street of Netherworld City.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo and company were nearby. The antelope and Chick were also standing on a stone slab. Everyone had a number on the stone slab beneath their feet.</p>
<p>As no one had moved, all the numbers were at 365. Even the antelope and Chick were no exception.</p>
<p>Due to the taboo power of Netherworld City, no one could use Companion Beasts. They could only rely on their own Essence Energy Arts and Essence Energy Skills.</p>
<p>If there were Guardians, they could also use the powers of Guardians. This had been confirmed through previous testing.</p>
<p>Most of the officers under An Tianzuo had advanced to the Mythical stage by using the Mythical Serum. Only two officers had contracted Guardians and were wearing Guardian armor. One of them was An Jingyu.</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng,” An Tianzuo sized up the torture chamber beside him and said to An Sheng.</p>
<p>“Got it,” An Sheng answered as a strange glow suffused his body. A halo spread out from beneath his feet, forming an area with a radius of about two meters around him.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo and company walked towards the halo which An Sheng had formed. When they were outside the halo, the number beneath their feet would change with every stone slab they walked on. However, when they entered An Sheng’s halo, the number beneath their feet no longer changed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at An Sheng in surprise. This ability was clearly similar to his Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. It was an ability that could restrain taboo powers.</p>
<p>However, An Sheng’s ability was regional. It was likely some kind of halo.</p>
<p>Seeing the surprise on Zhou Wen’s face, An Sheng said with a smile, “This is my Wheel of Destiny ability. It can temporarily block the taboo powers of Netherworld City. Young Master Wen, come over as well.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held Ya’er’s hand and walked over with Li Xuan and company. Chick and the antelope also entered the halo.</p>
<p>Within An Sheng’s halo, not only did the number under their feet not change, but it also didn’t trigger the ghosts of torture in Netherworld City. As long as they were inside the halo, they could walk around freely.</p>
<p>Everyone arrived in front of the first torture chamber. The torture chamber wasn’t open yet. An Sheng looked at An Tianzuo before looking at Zhou Wen. “Time is limited. It’s impossible for us to attempt two punishments. Who will bear the punishment here?”</p>
<p>“Of course it’s me,” Lu Bushun said as he wobbled his fat body forward.</p>
<p>“Let me do it,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Commander Lu’s body has infinite regeneration. Let him do it,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“It’s better to let Li Xuan do it. The power of these torture chambers is very special. Just a regeneration ability alone might not result in reaching the end.” Zhou Wen had suffered quite a number of punishments himself, so he naturally knew how formidable they were. It wasn’t just about a self-healing ability. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have specially sought out Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, I know you are an extraordinary person. My strength can’t compare with yours, but in terms of self-healing, I’m afraid no one will dare claim first place if I, Fatty Lu, claim second,” Lu Bushun said with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>“In that case, let’s split up,” Zhou Wen said as he looked at An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>An Sheng said, “Jingyu can only use Time Acceleration on one person. I’m afraid he won’t be able to divert his attention.”</p>
<p>“Just do your job. Don’t worry about us. We don’t need Time Acceleration,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“If you don’t use Time Acceleration, I’m afraid you won’t make it in time, right? Although there’s supposedly twenty-four hours, the torture chamber only opens once every hour. In fact, there are only twelve hours. There’s not enough time to withstand 239 punishments in twelve hours,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“I have my ways.” Zhou Wen didn’t explain further.</p>
<p>“Let him be,” An Tianzuo said indifferently.</p>
<p>When the time came, the torture chambers opened. Li Xuan and Lu Bushun walked towards the first torture chamber at the same time. The torture chamber stated ‘Saw Punishment.’</p>
<p>“You first.” Li Xuan and Lu Bushun arrived at the door. Seeing that Lu Bushun had no intention of giving way, Li Xuan made way.</p>
<p>Lu Bushun didn’t stand on ceremony as he entered the torture chamber. There was a steel saw with a wooden head in the torture chamber. The moment he entered, his body was chained to a log. When the saw landed, it began to slice his body into two.</p>
<p>Lu Bushun’s expression remained unchanged. The saw pulled back and forth, sawing open his stomach and revealing snow-white fat. However, after the sawing, his flesh automatically healed at an unbelievable speed.</p>
<p>The saw moved back and forth from his body. It should have sliced his body into two, but after the saw finished one cycle, his body completely healed without any injuries.</p>
<p>What an amazing self-healing ability! Even Zhou Wen was surprised by Lu Bushun’s self-healing ability.</p>
<p>After Lu Bushun came out, he gave Li Xuan a provocative look.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was amused as he gave Lu Bushun a friendly greeting. “Your self-healing ability is pretty good.”</p>
<p>“It’s alright.” Upon hearing Li Xuan, Lu Bushun stopped provoking him.</p>
<p>“There’s not much time. Continue.” An Tianzuo didn’t wish to waste a second as he urged Lu Bushun to continue heading to the next torture chamber.</p>
<p>Li Xuan walked into the saw torture chamber and with a flash, he was tied to a log. The steel saw also landed.</p>
<p>Others only saw the steel saw fly into the air, but Zhou Wen could tell that there was a white-robed ghost holding a saw on both sides of the steel saw. It directed the steel saw towards Li Xuan’s body.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1179'>Chapter 1179: Give it some Oomph</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>On An Tianzuo’s side, many people looked over. They also wanted to know if Zhou Wen and Li Xuan could really handle the sawing.</p>
<p>After all, this type of torture that could saw a person into two wasn’t something ordinary self-healing abilities could withstand.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they also wanted to know how Zhou Wen and company would resolve the problem of insufficient time.</p>
<p>After all, An Jingyu had used the Guardian’s temporal ability to accelerate the saw’s speed to finish the punishment quickly. Otherwise, the saw’s speed wasn’t fast. If the sawing was done slowly, it would probably take ten minutes for the punishment to end.</p>
<p>“Ah! It hurts!” Just as the saw touched Li Xuan’s body, Li Xuan cried out when the saw tore through his skin.</p>
<p>“Ah… Ah… Ah…” With every slice, Li Xuan let out a tragic cry.</p>
<p>The officers couldn’t help but frown. Although they knew that such a sawing would definitely be painful, Lu Bushun had endured it all without even letting out a grunt. It wasn’t very manly to shout like that.</p>
<p>As Li Xuan hadn’t entered the military and instead traveled around, he had spent most of his time in the South District. Therefore, they didn’t know much about him. All they knew was that Li Xuan was the third scion of Luoyang’s Li family, Zhou Wen’s good friend and classmate.</p>
<p>Seeing Li Xuan scream so tragically, Zhou Wen comforted him. “Li Xuan, bear with it. It’ll be fine in a while. I’ll get them to saw faster so that you won’t have to suffer for so long.”</p>
<p>When An Jingyu and company heard Zhou Wen’s words, they found it odd. What did he mean by asking them to saw faster? Was such a matter negotiable?</p>
<p>They originally imagined that Zhou Wen was only joking. He would probably use abilities similar to Time Acceleration or abilities with similar functions.</p>
<p>To their surprise, Zhou Wen stood outside the door and shouted into the torture chamber, “Saw faster.”</p>
<p>If this works, why would I be needed? An Jingyu muttered. He didn’t believe that this would work.</p>
<p>However, as soon as Zhou Wen said that, the steel saw that was pulling back and forth suddenly became like a connected electric saw. Its speed instantly increased.</p>
<p>However, despite the steel saw rapidly pulling back and forth, it couldn’t split Li Xuan at the waist despite the tremendous amount of blood on the saw. It looked terrifying, but the saw just didn’t go any lower.</p>
<p>Li Xuan cried out even more tragically, but his self-healing ability wasn’t inferior to Lu Bushun’s. When the steel saw stopped, he had already healed himself and cleared the round.</p>
<p>“It really f*cking hurts. It nearly killed me. Old Zhou, it’ll cost ya!” Li Xuan gritted his teeth as he walked out.</p>
<p>An Jingyu and company looked at Zhou Wen and Li Xuan with odd expressions.</p>
<p>This matter was negotiable? An Jingyu’s face was filled with puzzlement. He couldn’t help but look at the second torture chamber and hesitate. Should he try Zhou Wen’s method?</p>
<p>The second torture chamber was Oil Pot Punishment. There was a huge pot in the torture chamber, and the oil inside was atboiling point. Anyone who entered would probably be cooked instantly.</p>
<p>Lu Bushun had already been thrown in. The fats were sizzling and he was turning golden-brown. He even emitted a fragrance.</p>
<p>This punishment took at least ten minutes. An Tianzuo and company definitely couldn’t wait that long, so they needed An Jingyu to use Time Acceleration to make the ten minutes pass quickly.</p>
<p>But now, An Jingyu was a little suspicious. Could he negotiate with the oil pot in the torture chamber and get it to fry Lu Bushun faster?</p>
<p>Since Zhou Wen could negotiate, there was no reason why they couldn’t. If they could negotiate, he could save a lot of Essence Energy to deal with any subsequent problems.</p>
<p>If they really experienced all the punishments and entered the true Netherworld, they would definitely encounter many problems.</p>
<p>With this in mind, An Jingyu mimicked Zhou Wen’s actions and attempted to shout into the torture chamber, “Fry him faster.”</p>
<p>After he shouted, An Tianzuo and company stared at the pot of oil inside. They were also very curious if this matter was negotiable.</p>
<p>However, after waiting for a while, they realized that the pot remained the same. Nothing had changed.</p>
<p>An Jingyu’s face couldn’t help but turn red as he secretly spat in his heart. I must have been bewitched. There’s no room for negotiation regarding such matters. It would be a miracle if the negotiation succeeded.</p>
<p>“An Jingyu, what are you waiting for? Hurry up and use Time Acceleration.” Inside, Lu Bushun urged An Jingyu. The feeling of being fried didn’t feel good.</p>
<p>Although Lu Bushun had been enduring it, the terrifying pain nearly made him crush his teeth to pieces from all the gritting.</p>
<p>An Jingyu hurriedly used Time Acceleration to accelerate the punishment time. After two minutes, the Oil Pot Punishment was completed. Lu Buyu was teleported out of the oil pot.</p>
<p>His golden-brown flesh had already recovered, but his forehead was covered in cold sweat. It looked like he had been in excruciating pain.</p>
<p>Just as he walked out, Li Xuan walked in slowly. As he walked, he said, “Old Zhou, you’re really mean. You didn’t mention any of these while we were coming over. This will definitely cost ya!”</p>
<p>“Definitely.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he thought to himself, This isn’t a problem. When it’s time for the Wooden Horse Punishment, you can ask for as much as you want.</p>
<p>When Li Xuan entered the torture chamber, an invisible force immediately lifted his body and threw him into the boiling pot of oil.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Oil splattered everywhere as Li Xuan screamed tragically.</p>
<p>However, after a while, An Jingyu and company realized that Li Xuan’s body hadn’t been fried golden-brown by the oil pot. Apart from some red spots, there weren’t many changes.</p>
<p>Li Xuan also seemed to realize that the temperature of this thing wasn’t as high as he imagined. Therefore, he calmed down and leaned back against the pot. He placed his hands on the edge of the pot as though he was bathing in a bathtub.</p>
<p>Lu Bushun was dumbfounded. One had to know that the punishment here ignored defensive skills. One could only rely on their bodies to withstand it. After all, he had attained a Mythical body through the use of the Mythical Serum. Furthermore, his body was especially strong; yet, he couldn’t withstand the frying and was nearly fried into crispy pork.</p>
<p>As for Li Xuan, he was completely fine and even had a bath inside.</p>
<p>How strong is this fellow’s body of flesh and blood? An Jingyu and company were secretly alarmed.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, get them to give it some oomph,” Li Xuan shouted at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>He wasn’t showing off, but he wanted to use the Oil Pot Punishment to temper his body. The more his body endured, the stronger he became.</p>
<p>“Give it more heat,” Zhou Wen shouted.</p>
<p>If this works, I might as well go home, An Jingyu thought.</p>
<p>However, with Zhou Wen’s words, the flames under the pot suddenly intensified, nearly enveloping the entire pot. The temperature in the pot rose sharply.</p>
<p>An Jingyu’s eyes nearly popped out. The other officers were also dumbfounded.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1180'>Chapter 1180: Repeated Punishments</h3>
<p>“Faster,” Zhou Wen continued.</p>
<p>Time was limited, so there was no time for Li Xuan to slowly temper his body.</p>
<p>From the point of view of the average person, the Oil Pot Punishment seemed to obey Zhou Wen’s orders as though time was being accelerated.</p>
<p>However, An Sheng was naturally different. He could see some ethereal creatures—white-robed ghosts that were carrying out the punishments.</p>
<p>When he first saw them, they were slowly throwing in chopped wood that ordinary humans couldn’t see into the fire. However, when they saw Zhou Wen, the two white-robed ghosts immediately trembled in fear. At Zhou Wen’s order, they quickly added more wood to the bottom of the pot.</p>
<p>It was the same in the saw torture chamber. This left An Sheng very surprised, unsure how Zhou Wen had done it.</p>
<p>It was indeed right to wait for Young Master Wen to come. With him and Li Xuan around, the chances of safely rescuing Madam Lan are much higher. I hope Madam Lan and company can last until we arrive, An Sheng thought to himself.</p>
<p>A minute later, Li Xuan, who had completed the Oil Pot Punishment, came out. As An Jingyu and Lu Bushun had been watching Li Xuan , Lu Bushun hadn’t entered the third torture chamber to be punished.</p>
<p>“If you aren’t going, I’ll go in first.” Li Xuan smiled at Lu Bushun before entering the third torture chamber—Nail Chamber.</p>
<p>There were 108 foot-long steel nails in the Nail Chamber. One had to have all the nails nailed through their bodies to complete the punishment.</p>
<p>After Li Xuan entered, his limbs were immediately confined to the wall. Then, a nail flew towards his left hand. On the other side, a hammer slammed into the back of the nail, smashing through Li Xuan’s palm.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Li Xuan let out a tragic cry and couldn’t help but curse. “It f*cking hurts!”</p>
<p>“Just bear with it.” As Zhou Wen consoled him, he told the torturing ghosts to be faster.</p>
<p>Nails flew up one after another as the hammers brandished repeatedly, rapidly stabbing into Li Xuan’s body. Li Xuan kept screaming in pain.</p>
<p>In just a minute, all 108 steel nails were nailed into Li Xuan’s body. One of them was nailed to his manhood, causing Li Xuan’s face to turn green from the pain.</p>
<p>Thankfully, although he screamed miserably, none of his injuries looked serious. His injuries automatically healed and there were no signs of any injuries when he came out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be envious. Although he had some self-healing abilities, he was far inferior to Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Without any time to daydream, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan continued heading for the next torture chamber.</p>
<p>“Overseer, do we continue?” An Sheng asked carefully.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were faster than them. If they could pass all the punishments, there was naturally no need for Lu Bushun and company to continue.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo looked at Lu Bushun. Before he could say anything, Lu Bushun took the initiative to request an order. “Overseer, although Li Xuan’s self-healing ability is strong, he might not be stronger than me. Furthermore, it’s hard to say if he can withstand all the punishments with the way he is. If he fails, we won’t have the time to do it ourselves. Please let me continue.”</p>
<p>After Lu Bushun said that, he looked at Li Xuan’s back with eyes filled with determination.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s continue.” An Tianzuo nodded slightly.</p>
<p>“Overseer, don’t worry. If things don’t go well, I will definitely not embarrass our Sunset Army.” With that said, Lu Bushun walked towards the Nail Chamber.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and Lu Bushun suffered tortures at the same time, experiencing the torture chambers one by one.</p>
<p>The two of them had terrifying self-healing abilities. Others would experience tortures that spelled certain death every time if they were in their shoes, but the latter made one attempt after another. Their bodies didn’t suffer much damage.</p>
<p>The only difference was that Li Xuan kept crying out in pain, but Lu Bushun endured it quietly from beginning to end. No matter how painful the punishment was, he didn’t grunt.</p>
<p>Everyone watched as they walked down the torture chambers one after another. When the torture chambers closed, the two of them had experienced almost thirty punishments. However, every time they came out, their injuries were almost healed. People believed that there wouldn’t be any major problems and that they would definitely be able to withstand all the punishments in a day.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen knew very well that things weren’t as simple as they imagined.</p>
<p>The physical damage of the punishments here was only one aspect. Another aspect was the soul and psyche. Furthermore, such damage would constantly accumulate, eventually causing a mental breakdown. Li Xuan and Lu Bushun’s abilities to recover physically were fine, but it was still a question if they could last to the end.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was still very confident in Li Xuan. Although this fellow looked frivolous on the surface, his perseverance far exceeded that of the average person.</p>
<p>Back when he was in extreme rage, Li Xuan had managed to hold back from killing Li Mobai. Zhou Wen believed that he could hold out.</p>
<p>As the torture chamber would open again every hour, Zhou Wen and company stood on the long street to rest.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was resting, his eyes subconsciously glanced at the torture chamber behind him. It was the Wooden Horse Punishment torture chamber. According to his current progress, Li Xuan should enter the room in the next hour.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, shouldn’t you do something considering my great sacrifices?” Li Xuan said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What should I do?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t lack anything but a useful Companion Beast. My requirements aren’t high. Just get me a Terror-grade Companion Beast.” Li Xuan was actually joking. He wasn’t even taking himself seriously.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen agreed immediately.</p>
<p>“Really? You have a Terror-grade Companion Egg?” Li Xuan was slightly taken aback before he laughed, believing that Zhou Wen was joking.</p>
<p>A Terror-grade Companion Egg wasn’t something that could be obtained easily.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that the Terror-grade dimensional creatures were in the terrifying dimensional zones, it wasn’t easy to kill them. Even if one could kill them, they might not have a Companion Egg drop.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. I’ll definitely get you a Terror-grade Companion Beast. However, we have an agreement. You have to help me complete this trip through Netherworld City,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Why? Don’t you have confidence in me? Why are you using this trick to encourage me?” Li Xuan said unhappily.</p>
<p>“Just tell me if you can complete it.” Zhou Wen knew that as long as Li Xuan could complete the trip, he would definitely do so. He also wanted to take this opportunity to give Li Xuan a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“There’s definitely no problem,” Li Xuan said confidently.</p>
<p>Lu Bushun and company found his words unbelievable. Li Xuan’s tragic cries were still ringing in their ears.</p>
<p>“Alright, give me your hand,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“What? You want to read my fortune?” Li Xuan extended his hand and looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement, unsure what he was up to.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pressed his hand on Li Xuan’s hand and circulated the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1181'>Chapter 1181: Already Sullied</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>In Singularity Universe, a star was destroyed. At the same time, a Companion Beast on Zhou Wen’s body was transferred to Li Xuan. A strange mark appeared in Li Xuan’s palm.</p>
<p>The symbol was the Planet Devourer’s symbol. It was the Companion Beast that Zhou Wen had planned on transferring to Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Li Xuan hadn’t raised any questions and came without a word when he requested his help. However, this trip was just too dangerous. No one knew what was in the true Netherworld and what dangers there were.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had transferred the Planet Devourer to Li Xuan, hoping that he would have more self-protection abilities. If anything happened to him in the real Netherworld, he might be able to use it.</p>
<p>Of course, this was only the worst case scenario. With a Calamity bigshot like the antelope around, there might not be any danger even if they reached the true Netherworld.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, a Terror-grade Companion Beast?” After Li Xuan obtained the Planet Devourer, he also obtained some information about it. After learning of the Planet Devourer’s level and abilities, he immediately looked at Zhou Wen in surprise.</p>
<p>He wasn’t only surprised that Zhou Wen had really given him a Terror-grade Companion Beast, but he was also surprised that Zhou Wen had given him a hatched Companion Beast. Such an ability was completely unheard of.</p>
<p>If hatched Companion Beasts could be transferred at will without paying any price, the Federation would have long been in chaos.</p>
<p>When An Jingyu and company heard Li Xuan say that, they found it unbelievable. They imagined that Li Xuan was joking.</p>
<p>After all, they had never heard of casually gifting hatched Companion Beasts. Furthermore, it was a Terror-grade Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“Why are you giving me this? Take it back,” Li Xuan said with a frown.</p>
<p>“I only know how to give it to others and not take it back. If you don’t want it, why don’t you give it back to me?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Fine! You are rich and have what it takes to be willful. It’s a waste not to take it,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“You can’t take it for nothing. You have to help me complete this trip no matter what,” Zhou Wen said seriously.</p>
<p>“That’s nothing,” Li Xuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>Li Xuan didn’t summon the Planet Devourer. All he did was test it in its glove state without activating the Devourer ability before putting it away.</p>
<p>An hour later, the torture chambers opened again. Li Xuan strode to the next torture chamber and muttered, “If there’s such a good deal next time, remember to get me again.”</p>
<p>“Sure, I’ll definitely look for you,” Zhou Wen replied with a smile.</p>
<p>They cleared one torture chamber after another. Although Li Xuan cried out tragically, he managed to hold through them all. Finally, he arrived in front of the Wooden Horse Punishment torture chamber.</p>
<p>Li Xuan looked inside and his expression changed when he saw the wooden horse with horns on its back. Just as he was about to retreat, Zhou Wen kicked him into the wooden horse room.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, Zhou Wen, you tricked me… Ah…” Li Xuan’s cursing suddenly stopped. Then, there was a tragic cry and dead silence.</p>
<p>“Quickly finish it.” Zhou Wen didn’t look inside and covered his eyes with his hand as he shouted.</p>
<p>A minute later, Li Xuan limped out. His eyes were filled with tears as he wore a look of despair as though he was a maiden who had been defiled by a hundred men.</p>
<p>His lips trembled as he held his buttocks with one hand and pointed at Zhou Wen with a trembling finger. After a while, he said, “F*ck you.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen lowered his head and whispered like an old monk, “Ahem, form is emptiness and emptiness is form. Everything else is fleeting. It doesn’t exist. It doesn’t exist.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“F*ck your not existing. My first time is gone just like that. I feel that I’m not pure anymore. I’m already sullied…” Li Xuan looked up at a 45-degree angle as though he was holding back his tears.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. No one saw it. I covered my eyes,” Zhou Wen said with a fawning smile.</p>
<p>“Cover my ass! The gap between your fingers was bigger than the Grand Canyon,” Li Xuan said angrily.</p>
<p>“Ahem, aren’t you able to heal yourself? It’s fine. You’re completely fine now. Let’s forget about the past. It won’t affect anything anyway,” Zhou Wen said carefully.</p>
<p>“Shut up.” Li Xuan glared at him. “Be honest. Are there such punishments further on?”</p>
<p>“Probably… Perhaps… There’s still… some… I guess…” Zhou Wen stammered.</p>
<p>“F*ck it, I quit,” Li Xuan said angrily.</p>
<p>“You’ve taken the Companion Beast. Didn’t you say that there’s definitely no problem? Didn’t you say that it’ll be alright?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s lips moved, but he didn’t say a word for a while. Finally, he said hatefully, “Blame my luck for getting in too deep. Tell me honestly, how many more such punishments are there?”</p>
<p>“About three… four… five… six… seven… eight…”</p>
<p>“How many?”</p>
<p>“Nine.”</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, screw you. You will die a horrible death.”</p>
<p>Despite cursing, Li Xuan could only bite the bullet and walk to the next torture chamber.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo and company were curious as to what torture chamber it was that nearly made Li Xuan fall out with Zhou Wen. As their progress was much slower than Zhou Wen and company’s, they hadn’t seen the situation inside the Wooden House Punishment torture chamber.</p>
<p>When they walked over to take a look, their expressions immediately changed. Their expressions when they looked at Lu Bushun became odd.</p>
<p>Lu Bushun’s face was also somewhat pale. He felt his throat go dry. His lips quivered, but he didn’t say a word. All he did was gulp.</p>
<p>“Let’s head over now.” In the end, it was An Tianzuo who gave the order. He led the others over, leaving Lu Bushun and An Jingyu in front of the Wooden Horse Punishment torture chamber.</p>
<p>Lu Bushun closed his eyes and gritted his teeth before charging into the torture chamber.</p>
<p>In an hour, Li Xuan could withstand more than thirty punishments, while Lu Bushun could do about twenty plus. The main reason was that An Jingyu’s Time Acceleration wasn’t as effective as Zhou Wen’s words, so Lu Bushun was a little slower.</p>
<p>After suffering more than half the tortures, everyone could clearly sense that something was amiss with Lu Bushun.</p>
<p>Although his body looked like it had recovered, his expression was ugly. His expression was extremely grotesque as his body seemed to tremble slightly.</p>
<p>“Commander Lu, there’s no need to force it,” An Tianzuo said to Lu Bushun.</p>
<p>Lu Bushun looked at Li Xuan in front of him. Although Li Xuan kept screaming, he still persisted. Furthermore, his condition didn’t seem as bad as Lu Bushun’s.</p>
<p>“Overseer, don’t worry. I can still persist. I won’t embarrass our Sunset Army.” As Lu Bushun spoke, he strode towards the next torture chamber.</p>
<p>However, when Lu Bushun came out, he became even more beaten.</p>
<p>How did he persist all this time? Lu Bushun already knew the horror of consecutive punishments. Every time he was tortured, he felt as though he had entered hell. The pain had exceeded the limits of what humans could endure. Furthermore, as the number of punishments increased, the pain continued to increase.</p>
<p>Now, whenever Lu Bushun looked at a torture chamber’s door, he felt a kind of forbidding horror. It was as though it wasn’t a door but the entrance to hell.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1182'>Chapter 1182: The Last Torture Chamber</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that there were fewer of the living dead in Netherworld City than the last time he came. He didn’t see Chu He either.</p>
<p>Could it be that Chu He’s soul has already dissipated and can no longer be revived? Zhou Wen knew that the living dead in Netherworld City would constantly revive and repeat a life of torture.</p>
<p>However, every time they died, a portion of their memories would be erased.</p>
<p>Now that Chu He had vanished, it was highly likely that he was completely dead and had no chance of reviving.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was observing, he heard a tragic cry. However, this time, it wasn’t from Li Xuan, but Lu Bushun.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned his head and saw that Lu Bushun wasn’t in the torture chamber. He had already arrived outside, but he was slumped there with his two hands covering his head. His body trembled violently as he let out a horrified cry.</p>
<p>“Old Lu, are you alright? You are already out.” The officer who had a good relationship with Lu Bushun immediately pounced forward and shook his hand.</p>
<p>Gradually, Lu Bushun recovered. His eyes focused again as he became angry.</p>
<p>He stopped screaming and his body stopped trembling. However, his hand still trembled involuntarily.</p>
<p>“Overseer, I’ll rest for two minutes before we continue,” Lu Bushun said as he struggled to stand up.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to continue. Rest,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“Overseer, I can do it. I just need to rest for a while,” Lu Bushun hurriedly said.</p>
<p>“That shall be all. It’s an order,” An Tianzuo said expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“Yes, Overseer.” Lu Bushun saluted and had no choice but to stop.</p>
<p>In fact, Lu Bushun knew very well that it was very difficult for him to continue. Even if he continued experiencing the tortures, he probably wouldn’t be able to last more than a few chambers before he went crazy.</p>
<p>Looking at Li Xuan again, he realized that he had already exceeded him by more than twenty torture chambers. Although he could hear Li Xuan’s tragic cries, Li Xuan still persisted. He showed no signs of Lu Bushun’s situation.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo glanced at Lu Bushun’s chamber. It was the 134th torture chamber. There were still more than a hundred chambers from the 239th torture chamber, but Lu Bushun was at his limits. The difference was just too great.</p>
<p>And ahead, Li Xuan happened to come out of the torture chamber. He was still bickering with Zhou Wen, showing no signs of Lu Bushun’s situation.</p>
<p>“The Li family’s three brothers aren’t simple. Unfortunately, the Li family’s eldest brother died too early. Otherwise, the Li family would definitely have been a hegemon,” An Tianzuo said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan and Young Master Wen have an extremely good relationship. The Li family will likely help Luoyang in the future. This is a good thing,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“That depends on whether we can return alive.” An Tianzuo also knew that there would be great danger this time.</p>
<p>“With you and Young Master Wen around, we will definitely be able to return alive,” An Sheng said firmly.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo didn’t say a word as he looked at Zhou Wen and Li Xuan in front of him. Whether they could enter the true Netherworld now depended on them.</p>
<p>Li Xuan entered the torture chamber again. Although he was still chatting and laughing, Zhou Wen could sense that he was under immense pressure.</p>
<p>Being tortured repeatedly was different from being tortured by a random punishment. The damage to one’s mind and soul constantly accumulated. Even if one rested for an hour, it was impossible to expel all the buildup.</p>
<p>He could only rely on his psyche and beliefs to persist. There was no other way.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s screams were still tragic, but it additionally chilled the hearts of those who heard him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that he was truly in pain, and it was the kind that was produced when he was close to his limits.</p>
<p>There are still 23 torture chambers left. The torture chambers will open another three times today. Adding to this instance, there’s more than enough time. Let’s see if Li Xuan can last to the end. Zhou Wen counted the remaining torture chambers.</p>
<p>“Do you want to rest for a while? There’s still plenty of time,” Zhou Wen asked after some thought when he saw Li Xuan come out.</p>
<p>Li Xuan shook his head. He wasn’t injured, but his face was pale. However, there was a strange red flush on his pale face.</p>
<p>“Continue,” Li Xuan said as he walked to the next torture chamber.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo and company had already rushed over. When they saw Li Xuan being tortured, their hearts skipped a beat.</p>
<p>Even a veteran soldier like Lu Bushun couldn’t withstand the pain of the punishments. He had long broken down.</p>
<p>The fact that Li Xuan could last until now had already impressed them. However, Li Xuan’s situation seemed to be worsening. They were somewhat worried if Li Xuan could reach the end.</p>
<p>When Li Xuan came out again, he nearly fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was quick to react and went forward to help him up.</p>
<p>Li Xuan wasn’t injured and he still had strength left, but his mind was in a terrible mental state.</p>
<p>“How many torture chambers are there left?” Li Xuan asked again.</p>
<p>“Twenty-two,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“Continue.” Li Xuan pushed Zhou Wen’s hand away and walked in.</p>
<p>This time, the torture chamber was the torture of the hot pillar. After Li Xuan entered, he was tied to the iron pillar with his hands and feet hugging it. His face and body were stuck to it.</p>
<p>Sizzle!</p>
<p>White smoke rose from Li Xuan’s body and a burnt smell accompanied it. In an instant, Li Xuan had lost his human form. Just looking at him made one’s legs go limp, much less Li Xuan, who was being tortured. It was difficult to imagine how much pain he was in.</p>
<p>But now, Li Xuan stopped screaming.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ordered the punishment ghosts to speed up, but the torture of the hot pillar needed one to endure it for ten minutes. Even if the punishment ghosts wanted to speed it up, they couldn’t do so.</p>
<p>“Lend him to me. Any condition is fine.” Zhou Wen came in front of An Tianzuo and pointed at An Jingyu.</p>
<p>He wasn’t good at accelerating time, so he could only seek help from others to accelerate Li Xuan’s torture.</p>
<p>“This is my family’s business to begin with,” An Tianzuo said before ordering, “Jingyu, cooperate with them to complete the remaining punishments.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” An Jingyu quickly stepped forward and used Time Acceleration on the hot pillar.</p>
<p>However, Time Acceleration could only accelerate time, but it couldn’t shorten it. Li Xuan still suffered the same pain.</p>
<p>As time accelerated, a black carapace suddenly appeared on Li Xuan’s body and quickly enveloped him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart tightened when he saw the carapace on Li Xuan’s body.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s Life Soul and Wheel of Destiny were unique. Other people’s Life Souls and Wheel of Destiny were separate, but his was one. It was somewhat similar to Zhou Wen’s situation, but it wasn’t completely the same.</p>
<p>The carapace could be said to be his second life. The appearance of the carapace meant that Li Xuan was indeed reaching his limits.</p>
<p>After the carapace appeared, Li Xuan’s condition improved significantly. After enduring the punishment of hot pillar, he walked straight to the next torture chamber.</p>
<p>He was in a much better state. He went to the torture chambers one after another without any hesitation.</p>
<p>One couldn’t see his expression under the carapace, but one could tell from his trembling body that he was enduring the pain with all his might. He didn’t even dare say a word, afraid that he would lose the grit the moment he opened his mouth, losing the courage to continue the journey.</p>
<p>Seeing that there was only one torture chamber left, Zhou Wen and company were extremely nervous. The last torture chamber’s door had the words “Dream Punishment.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked into the room, but he didn’t see the white-robed punishment ghost. All he saw was a white-haired old woman sitting inside.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1183'>Chapter 1183: Thousand Year Dream</h3>
<p>What punishment is Dream Punishment? Zhou Wen frowned slightly. Apart from the white-haired granny, the stone table, and the stone bench, he didn’t see anything else in the room.</p>
<p>There didn’t seem to be any danger, but Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. He held back Li Xuan, who was about to enter the torture chamber.</p>
<p>“What?” Li Xuan’s voice was somewhat hoarse.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could sense his body trembling slightly. It was an uncontrollable spasm, not because of the damage to his body, but because of the psychological pressure.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen hadn’t attempted all the punishments in the past, from his attempts, he knew that the mental pressure and damage were immense. Even Zhou Wen suffered immense pressure despite his tenacity—and that was when he hadn’t attempted all the punishments.</p>
<p>However, even if the pressure was greater, Zhou Wen was likely able to withstand it. However, his recovery ability wasn’t as strong as Li Xuan’s. It was impossible for him to withstand all the punishments in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>“This torture chamber is the last torture chamber. I don’t think it’s that simple. It might be very dangerous,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“We’ll know if it’s dangerous after I enter. Anyway, we have to clear this round. There’s no need to think too much,” Li Xuan said as he walked into the Dream Punishment Chamber.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that Li Xuan was just saying that to make things appear fine, but he felt uneasy when he looked at the white-haired granny.</p>
<p>There were a total of 239 torture chambers on the long street. The other 238 torture chambers were filled with ordinary punishment ghosts. Only this room had a white-haired old lady. From this, one could tell that this torture chamber was definitely not simple.</p>
<p>However, just as Li Xuan had said, even if he knew that there were risks, he had to clear it.</p>
<p>After Li Xuan walked into the torture chamber, he wasn’t directly placed on torture equipment like before. He could still move freely as though he was outside.</p>
<p>“What punishment is this? Do you want me to sleep here and have a dream?” Li Xuan said to the white-haired granny.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and An Sheng suddenly realized that something was amiss. This was because only they could see the torture ghosts from before. Others couldn’t see them, but now, Li Xuan could see the white-haired granny.</p>
<p>“Can you see the white-haired granny inside?” An Sheng immediately asked Lu Bushun and company.</p>
<p>“I can see her. Your question is weird. Are we not supposed to see her?” Lu Bushun asked An Sheng in puzzlement as the others looked at him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and An Sheng exchanged looks. They knew that there was indeed a huge problem with this torture chamber.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo also looked at An Sheng, wanting to know what he meant. Just as An Sheng was about to say something, the white-haired old lady inside suddenly moved. Everyone’s eyes were immediately attracted to her, so An Sheng didn’t say a word.</p>
<p>The white-haired granny took out a tea bowl and a teapot from somewhere. She placed the tea bowl on the stone table in front of her and slowly poured water to fill it.</p>
<p>The tea in the bowl was a jade-green color, as though it had been soaked in bamboo leaves. However, there wasn’t a single tea leaf inside, much less a bamboo leaf.</p>
<p>“One dream in a thousand years; one dream for a thousand years. Drink this bowl of Thousand Year Dream. If you can walk out of it alive, you will be able to see the real Netherworld,” the white-haired old lady said in a strange tone that made one feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“You mean that I’ll sleep for a thousand years after drinking this bowl of tea?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“It won’t take that long since you don’t have that long of a lifespan. Even if you do, you would starve to death before being able to sleep for a thousand years,” the white-haired old granny said with a smile.</p>
<p>“My body is fine. I don’t need to sleep that much. Can I wake up early?” Li Xuan asked again.</p>
<p>“No. Even if a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal descends to the mortal world and drinks this bowl of Thousand Year Dream, he will definitely sleep for a thousand years. Not one second more, not one second less,” the white-haired granny said.</p>
<p>“There’s no solution?” Li Xuan frowned.</p>
<p>“There’s one.” The white-haired granny’s answer surprised everyone.</p>
<p>“What?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“One dream for a thousand years; one dream in a thousand years.” The white-haired granny repeated what she had said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan, come back.” Zhou Wen’s expression changed as he called Li Xuan out.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo and An Sheng’s expressions changed. Clearly, they understood what the white-haired granny meant.</p>
<p>One dream for a thousand years meant that this single dream would last for a thousand years. When the white-haired granny said that there was a solution, it was implying the first half of the sentence.</p>
<p>Since he could have one dream in a thousand years, he could also spend a thousand years in a dream but only spend a day or less in reality.</p>
<p>From the sound of it, having one dream in a thousand years was much easier than having a dream last a thousand years. After all, it was only a thousand years in a dream. In reality, he wouldn’t starve to death or be injured. It didn’t seem dangerous.</p>
<p>However, that wasn’t the case. To spend a thousand years in a dream, ignoring what kind of dream it was, just a thousand years was enough to make one’s will collapse.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been trapped on Fangzhang Mountain for only a hundred years. He had relied on his powerful willpower and focus on cultivation to last for a hundred years.</p>
<p>However, that didn’t mean that Zhou Wen was having a good time. If it hadn’t been for his extreme focus, he would have gone crazy from being imprisoned for a century.</p>
<p>Li Xuan clearly understood what the white-haired granny meant and asked, “One dream in a thousand years… How long is this dream?”</p>
<p>“Take the 238 prior punishments as one cycle, and one cycle lasts a day. If you want it long and have a long dream, it can be long. If you want it short, it can also be short. It all depends on your will,” said the white-haired granny.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan, come back. There’s no need to continue. Sis Lan and company definitely wouldn’t have been able to clear this round. It’s impossible for them to have entered the true Netherworld,” Zhou Wen’s expression changed as he said to the white-haired granny.</p>
<p>The white-haired granny had already made it very clear that suffering all the prior punishments in the dream was only considered a day. Then, how many times would he have to suffer in a dream that lasted a thousand years? Zhou Wen was momentarily unable to do the math, nor did he wish to.</p>
<p>No matter how resilient Li Xuan was, he had to suffer all the punishments once a day for a thousand years. To experience a thousand years like that would give a normal person a mental breakdown.</p>
<p>“Let’s end it here,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>Although there were various signs that Sis Lan and company had indeed entered Netherworld City, they hadn’t seen them in Netherworld City. It was highly likely that they had entered the real Netherworld. He wanted to enter no matter what.</p>
<p>However, such punishments weren’t something humans could withstand. An Tianzuo wasn’t willing to see Li Xuan die for nothing.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan had no intention of leaving the torture chamber. He looked back at Zhou Wen and said, “Since Sis Lan and company have entered Netherworld City, there’s no other possibility. They must have entered the real Netherworld. Since we’re here, we have to go in and take a look regardless.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1184'>Chapter 1184: Li Xuan’s Terror Transformation</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen’s figure flashed as he teleported into the Dream Punishment Chamber, hoping to pull Li Xuan out.</p>
<p>In the past, when he activated Great Brahma, he could do whatever he wanted. Even the punishment ghosts had to obey him, but this time, it was different.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was repelled by a force, preventing him from rushing into the torture chamber.</p>
<p>“One dream in a thousand years—living an additional thousand years longer than others is a good thing. It’s not something one can even beg for, so I lucked out,” Li Xuan said as he reached out to pick up the tea bowl.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan, don’t be silly. There’s no need to do this. We can think of another solution.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he condensed his strongest Terror power, hoping to rush in to stop Li Xuan.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, this torture chamber was completely different from the previous torture chambers. His Terror powers couldn’t penetrate it at all.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, don’t be anxious. I’ll be out in a jiffy. If I don’t come out in time, wait for me outside,” Li Xuan said as he drank the bowl of Thousand Year Dream without leaving a single drop.</p>
<p>“Nice tea.” Li Xuan licked his lips. Just as he finished speaking, he collapsed to the ground and fell asleep.</p>
<p>“Let him out.” Great Brahma appeared behind Zhou Wen as he attempted to order the white-haired granny to release Li Xuan.</p>
<p>However, the white-haired granny remained unperturbed. She sat there calmly and looked at Li Xuan who was sleeping on the ground.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo frowned as An Sheng shook his head with a bitter smile. Although one’s body wasn’t injured in the dream of a thousand years of torture, the mental pressure was enough to make any steel-willed human collapse.</p>
<p>An Sheng and An Tianzuo were people with extremely powerful wills, but even they didn’t dare claim that they could definitely withstand the torture.</p>
<p>Although the white-haired granny said that the Thousand Year Dream could be short if one wanted to, they didn’t have much time left in Netherworld City. If Li Xuan didn’t come out in time, even if he could withstand the Thousand Year Dream, his body would be killed by the rules of Netherworld City.</p>
<p>What can I do? Zhou Wen regretted inviting Li Xuan over.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried a few times, but he failed to charge into the Dream Punishment Chamber. He had already used several Terror-grade powers. Since the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and Great Brahma were useless, the rest were even more useless.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the antelope. At this moment, he could only rely on this Calamity-grade fellow.</p>
<p>When the antelope saw Zhou Wen look at it, it immediately turned its head to the side and pretended not to see him.</p>
<p>B*stard. Zhou Wen was somewhat helpless. However, from the antelope’s appearance, he knew that the white-haired granny in the Dream Punishment Chamber definitely had a terrifying background. She was definitely a Calamity-grade existence.</p>
<p>“Come on… Come on… Hehe… All together…” Just as Zhou Wen was feeling worried, he suddenly heard Li Xuan’s voice.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly turned his head and realized that Li Xuan wasn’t awake. Instead, he was talking in his sleep.</p>
<p>However, seeing the wretched smile on his face and the lascivious voice, it didn’t look like he was suffering torture in a dream.</p>
<p>“Harder… Harder…” Li Xuan cried out in pleasure.</p>
<p>Lu Bushun and company stood outside as they stared at the sleep-talking Li Xuan with a strange expression. They questioned what kind of dream he was having. Was it really as the white-haired granny had said—a torture?</p>
<p>What the hell is this fellow dreaming of? Zhou Wen looked at Li Xuan and felt that he wasn’t dreaming of torture.</p>
<p>However, it didn’t take long before Li Xuan’s face began to sweat. Not only was he sweating, but he was also heating up. His carapace mask was red as white smoke constantly emitted from his head.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that it was just a dream? Why did his body become like this?” Zhou Wen stared at the white-haired granny, prepared to use the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>“The brain of any creature has its limits. Under normal circumstances, the brain can only think about one thing. However, in the Thousand Year Dream, he’s making time pass too quickly in the dream. Time in reality is too slow, and this results in his brain needing to complete the thought processes that should have taken years, even decades, or centuries in an extremely short period of time. It’s already very rare that his brain didn’t explode,” the white-haired granny said.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you say so before?” Zhou Wen asked with a sullen expression.</p>
<p>“If you need others to explain everything to you without thinking for yourself, what use is your brain?” the white-haired granny said indifferently.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s carapace helmet was about to turn into flames. Zhou Wen knew that he couldn’t wait any longer. Otherwise, even if he could save Li Xuan, his mind might end up fried.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to draw his sword, he suddenly saw Li Xuan’s carapace flash with a strange light.</p>
<p>With Li Xuan’s head as the starting point, points of light flowed out like a data stream, instantly flowing through Li Xuan, turning his entire body into data points of light.</p>
<p>This power is… Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he found the power somewhat familiar.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen recalled why it looked familiar. Although this power had Li Xuan’s original attributes, it also had another creature’s attributes.</p>
<p>Alpha! Zhou Wen immediately realized what had happened.</p>
<p>Back then, the Guardian, Alpha, who resembled a nanomachine had possessed Li Xuan. In order to preserve his life, he had contracted Li Xuan in a strange manner.</p>
<p>One of the reasons Li Xuan could advance to the Mythical stage was because of Alpha.</p>
<p>The power that erupted from Li Xuan’s body, other than his Strength stat, was Alpha’s Strength stat. However, the two powers had already fused.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s body seemed to turn into a data stream. His entire body seemed to be formed by countless glowing points of light, making him look extremely illusory and unreal.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s vision, he could clearly see that Li Xuan’s body couldn’t be called a human body. The cells in his body seemed to have turned into nanomachines.</p>
<p>It was impossible for the human brain to handle so much work in such a short period of time, but now, Li Xuan’s entire being was like a super-brain, rapidly processing all sorts of data streams.</p>
<p>As the digitalization of his body sped up, Zhou Wen also felt the power fluctuations of the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Is he advancing to the Terror grade? Zhou Wen looked at Li Xuan in surprise and delight. He didn’t know if Li Xuan could survive the Thousand Year Dream after advancing to the Terror grade.</p>
<p>In the eyes of Lu Bushun and company, Li Xuan, who was glowing, was gradually turning transparent before completely disappearing as though he had turned invisible.</p>
<p>“Terror transformation?” An Jingyu looked in horror at the spot where Li Xuan had vanished and finally couldn’t help but shout.</p>
<p>Currently, there weren’t many humans who could reach the Terror grade. Most of them were humans who had contracted Guardians, and had raised the Guardian to the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Humans who advanced to the Terror grade on their own were very rare, even if they used the Mythical Serum.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was clearly different from the people who had contracted Guardians. His body was undergoing Terror transformation, not simply letting the Guardian undergo Terror transformation.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1185'>Chapter 1185: River of Forgetfulness Soup</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen could see Li Xuan in his Terror form as the data stream on his body constantly shimmered like a smart-brain that was rapidly processing calculations.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen didn’t know much about Li Xuan’s Terror transformation, it didn’t seem like the effects of the Thousand Year Dream on him were that intense.</p>
<p>After about half an hour, the rapidly flowing data over Li Xuan’s body finally stopped. His sleeping body also woke up.</p>
<p>After escaping the Terror transformation, Li Xuan’s body landed heavily on the ground.</p>
<p>“Does that count as me clearing the Dream Punishment? Do I need to do it again?” Li Xuan asked the white-haired granny.</p>
<p>However, when he looked over, he realized that the white-haired granny was gone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company didn’t notice when the white-haired granny had vanished either.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? I guess I cleared it?” Li Xuan walked out of the torture chamber.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Just as Li Xuan walked out of the torture chamber, he heard a loud bang. The door at the back of Netherworld City slowly opened, revealing a path that led outside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found it odd that he hadn’t seen City Lord Netherworld. The City Lord Netherworld he met previously had completely vanished. He hadn’t appeared from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as the door to Netherworld City opened, there was no desert scenery outside. Instead, a bridge appeared.</p>
<p>The stone bridge led into the distance, but there was no end in sight. Yellow smoke beneath the bridge churned, and nothing beneath could be seen.</p>
<p>At one end of the stone bridge sat the white-haired granny from the Dream Punishment Chamber. However, there was no stone table in front of her. There was only a huge pot. There seemed to be something boiling in the pot, but the steam was billowing above it as well. It was impossible to tell what was being cooked.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me this is the legendary Bridge of Helplessness and Granny Meng Soup?” Lu Bushun’s expression turned odd when he saw the bridge and pot.</p>
<p>In fact, when they saw this scene, the others also had the same thoughts as him.</p>
<p>The legend of the Bridge of Helplessness and Granny Meng’s soup was known by everyone in the East District.</p>
<p>Legend had it that after a person died, they would turn into a ghost. If a ghost wanted to reincarnate, they had to drink a bowl of Granny Meng’s soup and wash away the memories of their previous life. Only then could they undergo reincarnation as a pure soul.</p>
<p>In the Six Paths of Reincarnation for the Three Realms, all living beings had to drink such a bowl of soup when they reincarnated. It was obvious how magical and strange Granny Meng’s soup was.</p>
<p>After crossing the Bridge of Helplessness, it would be the true Netherworld. It wasn’t a place where the living were supposed to go.</p>
<p>At this point, even if hell was ahead, Zhou Wen and company could only take the risk.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo led his men towards the stone bridge. Zhou Wen and Li Xuan exchanged looks before heading towards it.</p>
<p>“The path to the Underworld must be taken without any lingering memories. If you wish to step onto the Bridge of Helplessness, you have to drink a bowl of River of Forgetfulness soup,” the white-haired granny said when An Tianzuo and company approached the stone bridge.</p>
<p>“Since this is really the River of Forgetfulness and the Bridge of Helplessness, this soup should be the Granny Meng Soup that can make people forget their past lives, right?” An Jingyu asked.</p>
<p>“I only know the River of Forgetfulness Soup, but I don’t know what Granny Meng Soup is,” the white-haired granny answered calmly without any change in expression.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you Granny Meng?” Lu Bushun asked.</p>
<p>“I’m only a bridgekeeper. All I know is to watch the bridge and sell soup. I’ve long forgotten my name.” The white-haired granny still had the same expression as before, as though it all had nothing to do with her.</p>
<p>“Then, will drinking your soup make people lose their memories?” Lu Bushun asked again.</p>
<p>“Yes,” the white-haired granny answered.</p>
<p>“Can we cross the bridge without drinking soup?” Unwilling to give up, Lu Bushun asked again.</p>
<p>“Yes.” The white-haired granny’s answer surprised everyone.</p>
<p>However, the white-haired granny continued, “As long as you die, you can cross the Bridge of Helplessness without drinking the River of Forgetfulness Soup.”</p>
<p>“Overseer, it looks like we can only force our way through,” Lu Bushun said softly to An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>“We mustn’t,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Although he had never seen this white-haired granny, who claimed to be a bridgekeeper, attack, from the antelope’s reaction, her strength was definitely at the Calamity grade. Furthermore, this was her territory. If they really fought, it was unknown how many people could survive, much less talk about saving Ouyang Lan and company.</p>
<p>“You forget everything when you drink the soup. What can we do if we don’t barge in?” Lu Bushun asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked in front of the white-haired granny and sized up the Bridge of Helplessness. He couldn’t see anything. All he could see was billowing yellow smoke. It was unknown how deep the River of Forgetfulness was.</p>
<p>“May I ask if a group of humans came here about ten days ago?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I forgot. I only sell soup and don’t look at their faces,” the white-haired granny answered expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“Then did you sell any soup ten days ago?” Zhou Wen wasn’t anxious as he asked after some thought.</p>
<p>“Yes.” The white-haired granny finally answered Zhou Wen’s question.</p>
<p>“Can you tell me how many bowls you sold that day?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“Eight bowls,” the white-haired granny answered.</p>
<p>“That’s right. It should be Madam Lan and company. According to the clues and information, there should have been eight who retreated into Netherworld City,” Lu Bushun said happily.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo and An Sheng jolted. Madam Lan and company were likely still alive, so this was naturally good news.</p>
<p>“Did all of them drink the soup?” An Tianzuo asked.</p>
<p>“To cross the Bridge of Helplessness, they naturally have to drink the River of Forgetfulness Soup unless they’re dead,” the white-haired granny answered.</p>
<p>“Is it possible to drink the River of Forgetfulness Soup without losing your memories?” An Tianzuo asked again.</p>
<p>“There’s the Three-Lives Stone in the River of Forgetfulness. If you can engrave your name on the Three-Lives Stone, you won’t lose your memories of your past life even if you drink the River of Forgetfulness Soup,” the white-haired granny answered.</p>
<p>“Where’s the Three-Lives Stone?” Lu Bushun hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“In the River of Forgetfulness.” The white-haired granny’s answer disappointed everyone.</p>
<p>It was unknown how big or deep the river with the billowing yellow smoke was. They also didn’t know what the Three-Lives Stone looked like. It was like searching for a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen…” An Sheng looked at Zhou Wen. It seemed a little difficult to find the Three-Lives Stone now. If possible, it was best to barge through.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had previously said that they couldn’t barge in, so An Sheng wanted to seek his opinion.</p>
<p>“Let’s search for it.” Zhou Wen looked at the River of Forgetfulness, hoping to find the legendary Three-Lives Stone.</p>
<p>The legendary Three-Lives Stone was something that recorded one’s past and present lives. However, it looked different from the legends.</p>
<p>Lu Bushun and company looked at An Tianzuo. They ultimately followed his lead.</p>
<p>“Find the Three-Lives Stone.” An Tianzuo glanced at Zhou Wen before looking at the River of Forgetfulness.</p>
<p>“Overseer, we can use Companion Beasts here. Let me give it a try,” an officer said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company also realized that this place was different from Netherworld City. There was no taboo power that prohibited flight and Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo nodded as the officer summoned a huge silver eagle. Under his control, the eagle flew towards the River of Forgetfulness. Just as it touched the yellow smoke in the river, it was suddenly yanked into the yellow smoke. Then, it vanished. The eagle symbol on the officer’s body also vanished.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1186'>Chapter 1186: River of Forgetfulness</h3>
<p>The officers under An Tianzuo made a few more tries, but the outcome was the same every time. No matter what kind of Companion Beast it was—regardless of its attributes or type—as long as it approached the River of Forgetfulness’s smoke, it would immediately plummet into the river without a trace. It wouldn’t even cause a ripple.</p>
<p>It was useless for the Companion Beasts to attack the River of Forgetfulness. They all vanished the moment they entered the river. It was unknown how deep the River of Forgetfulness was.</p>
<p>It was impossible to even enter the River of Forgetfulness, much less search for the Three-Lives Stone in the river.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan also summoned some low-level Companion Beasts and made them attempt to approach the River of Forgetfulness. However, just like An Tianzuo and company’s attempts, no Companion Beast could survive in the River of Forgetfulness.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen listened attentively and used Great Brahma to strengthen his senses. He looked into the River of Forgetfulness, but he didn’t discover anything.</p>
<p>“Overseer, let me give it a try.” An officer stood up and saluted An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan glanced at the officer and saw that he was wearing a military uniform and a military coat. He wore a gas mask and a military cap.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan had some impression of this officer because his attire was very odd. They didn’t know what he looked like or what his name was.</p>
<p>“Are you confident?” An Tianzuo asked the officer.</p>
<p>“I noticed something. I can give it a try,” the officer answered.</p>
<p>“Proceed.” An Tianzuo nodded slightly.</p>
<p>The officer saluted slightly before walking towards the River of Forgetfulness. However, to Zhou Wen’s surprise, he didn’t summon his Companion Beast. Instead, he walked towards the River of Forgetfulness himself.</p>
<p>He walked very slowly. It could be described as being very careful, but for him to step into the River of Forgetfulness was clear madness.</p>
<p>Previously, when they used Companion Beasts to scout a path, a Mythical Companion Beast had been sucked into the River of Forgetfulness without any resistance. For the officer to walk in alone was no different from suicide.</p>
<p>The moment the person stepped out, his military uniform seemed to be pulled by some powerful invisible force. It was ripped from his body and dropped down into the River of Forgetfulness along with his military boots, military cap, and mask.</p>
<p>As for the officer’s body, it floated above the River of Forgetfulness without falling.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were alarmed when they saw the officer’s appearance.</p>
<p>The officer’s body no longer looked like a human’s. There was no flesh or blood on it. What they saw was a humanoid gray smoke. As he moved, the smoke ebbed, making him look extremely strange.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that this officer wasn’t a monster. He had only used the Mythical Serum created from a special dimensional creature. His body had mutated to a higher level, allowing him to be in such a state.</p>
<p>The smoke-like officer’s feet had now stepped onto the River of Forgetfulness, but he wasn’t sucked down. Everyone heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“What dimensional creature’s Mythical Serum did this person use? How interesting,” Li Xuan said as he looked at the officer in surprise.</p>
<p>An Sheng explained, “That’s Commander Jia Nong of 413 Task Force. The Mythical Serum he used was created by a strange Mythical creature that broke out of Chess Mountain. His body mutated severely, but he also obtained a very special Mythical power. From the looks of it, his strength can restrain the power of the River of Forgetfulness.”</p>
<p>“Overseer, I’ll go down and take a look.” Jia Nong realized that things were as he had guessed. The River of Forgetfulness’s strange power was useless against him, so he sought An Tianzuo’s permission.</p>
<p>“Safety first,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Jia Nong answered and was about to fly down the River of Forgetfulness.</p>
<p>However, he suddenly saw yellow smoke billowing in the distance of the River of Forgetfulness. It was as though something was burrowing beneath. Furthermore, the churning fog was approaching Jia Nong at an extremely fast speed.</p>
<p>Jia Nong assumed a battle stance, but An Tianzuo suddenly shouted, “Jia Nong, return!”</p>
<p>Upon hearing An Tianzuo’s order, Jia Nong retreated and left the River of Forgetfulness.</p>
<p>At the instant he retreated, the yellow smoke exploded where he was standing. A blood-colored palm extended out.</p>
<p>Just one finger of the blood-colored palm was more than a meter long. The huge palm seemed to be condensed from blood. With a grab, a terrifying sonic boom sounded in the air.</p>
<p>After grabbing nothing, the blood-colored palm quickly retreated to the River of Forgetfulness and vanished in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Jia Nong felt a lingering fear. Although his body wasn’t afraid of ordinary physical attacks, the blood-colored palm had only swiped against his body once and had melted much of the gray fog over his body. If he had really been caught, he would probably have vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>“What was that?” Li Xuan wrinkled his nose as he smelled a strong scent of blood.</p>
<p>No one could answer him because no one knew the answer. The white-haired granny guarding the bridge might know the answer, but she didn’t say a word.</p>
<p>Finding the Three-Lives Stone was more difficult than they had imagined. Currently, the only person who could enter the river was Jia Nong, but he couldn’t withstand the blood-colored hand.</p>
<p>Lu Bushun said with a strange expression, “Legend has it that the River of Forgetfulness is the dividing line between life and death. There are countless wraiths lingering between life and death in the river. As those wraiths can’t cross the Bridge of Forgetfulness, they can’t reincarnate. They can only wander in the River of Forgetfulness forever. If a living person comes to the River of Forgetfulness, they will pull them down to replace them. From there, they can escape the restrictions of the River of Forgetfulness and obtain the chance to reincarnate. Was that blood hand from before a kind of legendary wraith?”</p>
<p>“What you said is a scapegoat in myths. You can obtain a chance of rebirth by finding a substitute to replace yourself,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Yes, a scapegoat. Could that bloody hand be that thing?” Lu Bushun nodded.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but from the looks of it, we can only think of a way to resolve it if we want to find the Three-Lives Stone,” An Sheng said as he stared at the river.</p>
<p>“Commander Jia, only you can enter the river now. I can only request you make another trip to lure it out,” An Tianzuo said to Jia Nong.</p>
<p>“Yes sir.” Without any hesitation, Jia Nong entered the River of Forgetfulness again.</p>
<p>This time, he was rather careful, but he couldn’t sense the blood-colored hand ahead of time. It was only when An Sheng warned him that he could escape in time.</p>
<p>When the blood-colored hand appeared, Lu Bushun and the other officers immediately attacked it. Essence Energy of different attributes struck the blood-colored hand, scattering it.</p>
<p>However, in the blink of an eye, the scattered sanguine aura condensed again, turning into a blood-colored hand that drilled back into the River of Forgetfulness.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1187'>Chapter 1187: Three-Lives Stone</h3>
<p>Everyone was dumbfounded to see their attacks rendered ineffective.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo frowned and said, “From the looks of it, the blood-colored hand is something like a scapegoat. It has an extreme Yin attribute. It’s very difficult for ordinary strength to really injure it. Only the most extreme Yang forces can do so.”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, Miss Jing didn’t come. Her Essence Energy Art is extreme Yang. It’s the nemesis of these Yin creatures,” An Sheng said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“Although I’ve long expected to encounter such a creature, the Yang-type Companion Beasts we prepared aren’t enough to kill the scapegoat. If there’s no other way, I’m afraid we won’t be able to go down the river to find the Three-Lives Stone,” Lu Bushun said gloomily.</p>
<p>“Commander Jia, can I trouble you to lure the bloody hand out again? Let me give it a try,” Zhou Wen said to Jia Nong.</p>
<p>“Of course.” What Zhou Wen and Li Xuan had done was enough to make Jia Nong and company respect them. Therefore, Jia Nong didn’t think too much about it. He immediately asked An Tianzuo for permission before heading down the river.</p>
<p>Perhaps angered by the previous attack, the moment Jia Nong entered the river, the blood-colored hand rushed out unexpectedly.</p>
<p>As it was too sudden, An Sheng didn’t have the time to warn them. Just as everyone was alarmed, they suddenly saw a golden light flash.</p>
<p>Before the blood-colored hand grabbed Jia Nong, the golden beam pierced through the blood-colored hand.</p>
<p>A golden monkey appeared behind the blood-colored hand. It opened its mouth and sucked in the blood mist that formed the blood-colored hand. Like red milk tea, it was sucked into the monkey’s mouth. The blood-colored hand couldn’t resist at all.</p>
<p>The remaining portions of the blood-colored hand wanted to escape back to the River of Forgetfulness, but it was too late.</p>
<p>Two earrings on the little monkey’s ears shattered one after another, turning it into a dark-gold behemoth. Golden light shone everywhere over its body. Wherever the golden light went, it dispersed the yellow fog over the River of Forgetfulness, revealing a huge blood-colored ghostly shadow.</p>
<p>The blood-colored ghostly shadow was neither human nor ghost. Lurking in the river, one of its palms had been severed.</p>
<p>Truth Listener roared and rushed above the fleeing blood-colored shadow. It opened its mouth and swallowed it as though it was slurping jelly.</p>
<p>That’s… the Companion Beast that fought Di Tian… Human Sovereign… Could Zhou Wen be Human Sovereign… An Jingyu suddenly jolted when he saw Truth Listener transform. He thought of something unbelievable as he widened his eyes and couldn’t help but look at Zhou Wen who was standing by the River of Forgetfulness.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just An Jingyu. Everyone who had seen Truth Listener fight Di Tian recognized it. After all, Truth Listener’s appearance and battle had been too shocking.</p>
<p>That was a terrifying existence that could withstand a Calamity-grade creature. Even five years later, no human had such a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“No wonder. So that’s how it is. It’s no wonder that in Netherworld City, even the torture tools in the torture chambers have to obey Young Master Wen’s orders. So Young Master Wen is Human Sovereign… I never expected…” Lu Bushun said in delight.</p>
<p>The way everyone looked at Zhou Wen changed. If it was only respect before, now, their eyes seemed to be filled with worship.</p>
<p>To be able to fight alongside Human Sovereign made them feel honored.</p>
<p>“Adjutant An… Is Young Master Wen really… that person?” Lu Bushun wasn’t sure as he whispered to An Sheng.</p>
<p>“If you think so, so be it. If you think otherwise, so be it,” An Sheng said ambiguously.</p>
<p>Lu Bushun was somewhat depressed. He felt his heart itching to know the answer. Meanwhile, over the River of Forgetfulness, Truth Listener had already shown its might.</p>
<p>Truth Listener charged into the River of Forgetfulness. Wherever it passed, the yellow smoke was melted by the golden light from its body. Scapegoats appeared one after another.</p>
<p>However, Truth Listener was extremely effective against dimensional creatures like scapegoats. As long as the scapegoats approached it, they would immediately be devoured. It was like a god incarnate.</p>
<p>The scapegoats that originally made people feel terrified now gave off a weak and pitiful feeling.</p>
<p>After Truth Listener charged around for a while, it suddenly discovered a strange stone erected by the riverside where the smoke dissipated.</p>
<p>The stone was thirty feet tall and stood alone near the riverbank. However, it was different from ordinary river rocks. The stone was red in color and its form resembled a baby in swaddling clothes. The stone emitted a faint red glow.</p>
<p>Previously, it had been hidden by the yellow smoke and scapegoats in the river and couldn’t be seen. Now that it was right in front of everyone, they immediately felt that it was extraordinary.</p>
<p>“Is that the Three-Lives Stone?” Li Xuan asked as he sized up the strange stone.</p>
<p>No one could answer him. No one had seen the legendary Three-Lives Stone before, so they naturally couldn’t tell if it was real or fake.</p>
<p>“Overseer, let me give it a try.” Jia Nong sought An Tianzuo’s permission.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo nodded slightly as Jia Nong flew towards Three-Lives Stone.</p>
<p>With Truth Listener there, the surrounding yellow smoke and scapegoats didn’t approach. Jia Nong successfully arrived in front of the strange stone. He extended his smoky fingers that swiped at the Three-Lives Stone.</p>
<p>The white-haired granny had said that as long as they could leave their names on the Three-Lives Stone, they wouldn’t be affected by the River of Forgetfulness Soup.</p>
<p>However, Jia Nong’s finger failed to leave any marks on the strange stone.</p>
<p>Jia Nong condensed his strength again. This time, he used all his strength. The gray smoke converged into a sharp blade and slashed at the strange stone. The strange stone remained unharmed. It didn’t leave a mark.</p>
<p>“Let me give it a try.” An Jingyu wanted to use his temporal powers to leave a mark on the strange stone.</p>
<p>He pointed at the strange stone. Although it was only a single point, countless fingers seemed to point at the same spot.</p>
<p>This move of his was called Water Droplet Penetration. It used the power of time to turn the attack of a single tap into a continuous attack. With An Jingyu’s present ability, he had actually repeated the same tap more than three hundred times.</p>
<p>However, despite such continuous attacks, the Three-Lives Stone remained unmoved. It didn’t leave any imprints—not even a fingerprint.</p>
<p>Although they had found the Three-Lives Stone, they couldn’t leave their names on it. It was no different from not having found it.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at An Tianzuo and Zhou Wen. They suspected that Zhou Wen was Human Sovereign and felt more respect for him. They couldn’t help but think of him when they encountered problems.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and An Tianzuo had no intention of making an attempt. Instead, An Tianzuo walked back and arrived in front of the Bridge of Helplessness. He asked the white-haired granny, “Ma’am, how can one leave their name on the Three-Lives Stone?”</p>
<p>The white-haired granny said coldly, “The Three-Lives Stone is about three lives. One naturally has to have a past and present life to leave a name on it. Without a past and present life, it’s naturally impossible to leave a name on it.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1188'>Chapter 1188: Leaving Names</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Do humans really have past lives?” Zhou Wen frowned inwardly. He didn’t believe in reincarnation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had always felt that it didn’t matter if someone died. There wouldn’t be anything like a previous life or next life.</p>
<p>“We’ll know once we give it a try.” Li Xuan was intrigued. He ran to the Three-Lives Stone and made an attempt, but like An Jingyu and company, he failed to leave a mark on it.</p>
<p>“It’s indeed a lie. How can I not have a previous life? I must have been an emperor in my previous life with a huge harem,” Li Xuan muttered hatefully.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo also got the remaining officers to give it a try, but just like An Jingyu, none of them could leave a mark on the Three-Lives Stone.</p>
<p>Everyone felt that it was very likely that they had been fooled by the white-haired granny. However, when it was An Sheng’s turn, his finger sank in upon gently touching it. This was different from the previous attempts in which the Three-Lives Stone was extremely hard and undamageable by any weapon. It was now like sand.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>An Sheng was slightly taken aback before he casually wrote down his name.</p>
<p>After An Sheng finished writing his name, his finger left the Three-Lives Stone. The name on it flashed with golden light before disappearing.</p>
<p>“Does this count as a success?” Everyone looked at the Three-Lives Stone and An Sheng in surprise.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo also went up to give it a try, but like the other officers, he failed to leave any marks on the Three-Lives Stone.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t make sense. Isn’t it said that all creatures can be reincarnated? Why is Adjutant An the only one with a past and present life, while we don’t? We aren’t any less real than Adjutant An. Why is he the only one with a past and present life?” Lu Bushun grumbled.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if he has a past or present life. What matters is how we cross the Bridge of Helplessness. Only Adjutant An can leave his name on the Three-Lives Stone. We can’t just let him go alone, right?” An Jingyu said.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo frowned at the thought. Clearly, he couldn’t accept such an outcome.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, do you want to give it a try too?” Lu Bushun asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Lu Bushun was eager to know if Zhou Wen was Human Sovereign or if he just had a similar Companion Beast.</p>
<p>The others also looked at Zhou Wen, wondering if he could leave his name on the Three-Lives Stone.</p>
<p>Although reincarnation was said to be ethereal and unreal, many people still hoped that there would be a next life. It could be considered a form of spiritual sustenance.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and walked towards the Three-Lives Stone with Ya’er in his arms. He also wanted to know if he could leave his name on the Three-Lives Stone like An Sheng.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his finger and pressed it on the Three-Lives Stone. Everyone’s eyes were drawn by his finger.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen pressed his finger on it, the Three-Lives Stone didn’t react at all. Clearly, he didn’t have a past life.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to retreat, Ya’er extended her finger and pressed it on the Three-Lives Stone. However, the hard rock turned extremely soft under Ya’er’s finger. Soon, Ya’er wrote the word “Ya’er” on the Three-Lives Stone.</p>
<p>Could it be that reincarnation really exists in this world? Zhou Wen felt odd when he saw this.</p>
<p>Ya’er was half-human and half-ghost, but when she first born, it was said that she was the reincarnation of a Gu God.</p>
<p>Now, she had managed to engrave her name on the Three-Lives Stone. This made one’s imagination run wild. Why was she able to engrave her name? Could she really be the reincarnation of a Gu God?</p>
<p>In the end, only An Sheng and Ya’er left their names on the Three-Lives Stone, but it was impossible for them to cross the bridge to save Ouyang Lan. Everyone was somewhat vexed.</p>
<p>Despite knowing that Ouyang Lan and company might be ahead, they couldn’t walk forward no matter what.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, the only way is to storm through by force.” Lu Bushun rubbed his fists in eagerness.</p>
<p>Everyone returned to the white-haired granny. Zhou Wen knew that it was impossible to barge in. He looked at her and asked, “Apart from leaving our name on the Three-Lives Stone, is there no other way to cross the Bridge of Helplessness without losing our memories?”</p>
<p>“No,” the white-haired granny answered firmly.</p>
<p>Everyone fell silent as Zhou Wen pondered for a moment before suddenly turning around and walking towards the Three-Lives Stone.</p>
<p>Even the antelope didn’t dare offend the white-haired granny; therefore, it was almost impossible for them to barge through. They might as well think of a solution regarding the Three-Lives Stone.</p>
<p>Previously, Zhou Wen had only casually pressed down, so it was understandable that he hadn’t left any traces.</p>
<p>Now that he was at the end of his tether and he was bent on crossing the Bridge of Helplessness, he could only turn his sights back to the Three-Lives Stone again.</p>
<p>As he circulated Terror-grade power, he struck the Three-Lives Stone, but the outcome was the same. Even Terror-grade power couldn’t deal damage to the Three-Lives Stone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen switched to several different Terror powers and used all of them, but none of them worked.</p>
<p>Demon God Body, Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, Clown Mask, Singularity Universe, and Great Brahma’s powers were useless.</p>
<p>How can I satisfy this condition of having a past and present life? Zhou Wen frowned in thought.</p>
<p>Lu Bushun and company were somewhat alarmed when they saw that Zhou Wen was still unable to leave a mark on the Three-Lives Stone despite all his efforts.</p>
<p>If even Zhou Wen couldn’t do it, there was probably no hope.</p>
<p>I don’t believe it. Can’t I leave a mark on it? Zhou Wen began carving Sword Pill on his Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>Soon, a sword pill appeared in Zhou Wen’s palm. He reached out to grab it, and it immediately transformed into a sword.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the sword transformed from Sword Pill and slashed at the Three-Lives Stone, but things remained the same.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had no intention of stopping. He continued slashing at the Three-Lives Stone again and again. He seemed to treat the Three-Lives Stone as a blade tester as he constantly slashed at it.</p>
<p>However, no matter how terrifying Zhou Wen’s strike was, it couldn’t leave a mark on the Three-Lives Stone.</p>
<p>Indeed, it’s just a Companion Beast of the same species. From the looks of it, Young Master Wen isn’t Human Sovereign. Seeing that Zhou Wen hadn’t even cracked the Three-Lives Stone’s surface after slashing at it for so long, Lu Bushun began to doubt his previous judgment.</p>
<p>Human Sovereign’s slash at Di Tian was an extremely dominating force. Although the force Zhou Wen was dishing out was powerful, it wasn’t as powerful as Human Sovereign’s. Furthermore, the weapon in Zhou Wen’s hand wasn’t the legendary sword.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to them, the Immortal Culling Sword couldn’t be used casually.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t care what they thought as he continued slashing at the Three-Lives Stone. At the same time, he engraved the Sword Pill on his Wheel of Destiny again and again.</p>
<p>He gave all his ideas a try. Not only did he push his sword techniques closer to perfection, but he also made Sword Pill begin to change.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1189'>Chapter 1189: Incomplete Sword Pill</h3>
<p>Although Sword Pill was in the form of a sword, its essence was a Qi Refinement technique. It was a technique that absorbed the Heaven and Earth energies for its own use.</p>
<p>In ancient times, Qi Refinement warriors pursued Qi Refinement to strengthen themselves to reach the ethereal realm of immortality.</p>
<p>Although he had never heard of any Qi Refinement warrior reaching the realm of immortality, it was an extension of humanity’s pursuit of life.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen condensed his energy into a sword. Instead of saying that he was practicing his sword art, it was better to say that he was converting his beliefs into a sword.</p>
<p>My mind is on the sword. Life and death are separated by a thought. I only wish for my thoughts to be free in this life. What has my next life got to do with me? Zhou Wen engraved the Sword Pill repeatedly, hoping to draw it into the shape of a sword.</p>
<p>At that moment, what Zhou Wen was drawing wasn’t a sword, but his beliefs. The sword was akin to him as a person—his heart. The more resilient his heart was, the sharper the sword.</p>
<p>I’d rather be average in an aboveboard manner than compromise my values. The sword that Zhou Wen had drawn was just and moderate; its blade was straight, in the most traditional East District sword style. The sword was like its owner, and this sword was a reflection of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, the sword engraved on the Wheel of Destiny failed to help Sword Pill advance to the Terror grade.</p>
<p>What’s missing? What’s missing? Zhou Wen reflected on himself. In his hundred years of meditation, he had spent relatively less time on the Qi Refinement Art and Sword Pill.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because Zhou Wen didn’t like using swords, but because the Qi Refinement Art was too monotonous. Just practicing and comprehending summarized the essence of this Essence Energy Art.</p>
<p>However, with his body trapped, Zhou Wen could only hypothesize without actual practice. Without being able to practice, he lacked the most basic step, making it very difficult for him to take the next step forward. Thus, Zhou Wen hadn’t spent too much time on Qi Refinement.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen slashed down again and again, carving the Sword Pill over and over again. The Sword Pill he drew was somewhat different every time, but none of them could stabilize the Wheel of Destiny. Clearly, he hadn’t truly found his Sword Heart.</p>
<p>What’s my Sword Heart? Killing? Protection? Acting recklessly? None of them seem to be the case. Zhou Wen realized that he didn’t seem to understand himself.</p>
<p>He failed again and again. It had been a long time since Zhou Wen had failed like this. The previous few Essence Energy Arts had successfully completed a Terror transformation, making him feel a little smug. He felt that he would achieve the remaining few Essence Energy Arts in just a matter of time.</p>
<p>Does it still not work? The Sword Pill that had been engraved on the Wheel of Destiny vanished again, leaving Zhou Wen somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the hardest thing to understand wasn’t one’s opponent, but oneself. This was because one could see others, but not oneself.</p>
<p>Before a mirror appeared, no one knew what they looked like. It could be said that they were their most familiar strangers.</p>
<p>A mirror reflects the body; whereas a person reflects the heart. I haven’t met a person who can let me see myself for who I am. I’m afraid it will be difficult for me to condense a true Sword Heart… Zhou Wen’s mind raced.</p>
<p>He knew where his flaws were, but he had no intention of giving up. He wanted to take another path.</p>
<p>Since I still don’t understand my heart, can I use other methods to replace it? Zhou Wen thought of the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>Back when he slew Di Tian with a single strike, he had personally experienced the terrifying sword intent of the Immortal Culling Sword. No one understood the concepts and beliefs in that sword better than him.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen recalled the Immortal Culling Sword, he continued carving on the Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>Lu Bushun and company watched Zhou Wen slash the Three-Lives Stone countless times, but none of them left a mark. Instead, the sword condensed in his hand shattered again and again. They had lost hope.</p>
<p>“Overseer, can we think of a way to cross the Bridge of Helplessness without passing it?” Lu Bushun said as he sized up the River of Forgetfulness.</p>
<p>An Sheng shook his head and said, “Legend has it that the River of Forgetfulness is the boundary between the two worlds. It’s no longer a matter of distance from the world of the living to the world of the dead. If we could cross the Bridge of Helplessness without taking it, there wouldn’t be so many wraiths trapped in the River of Forgetfulness.”</p>
<p>“But we can’t continue like this. Young Master Wen’s sword art is so powerful, yet he can’t leave a mark on the Three-Lives Stone. I’m afraid we won’t be able to take this path,” Lu Bushun said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“Overseer, why don’t I go over and take a look first?” An Sheng suggested. He wanted to cross the Bridge of Helplessness to find Ouyang Lan and company.</p>
<p>“Wait a little longer,” An Tianzuo said as he looked in the direction of the Bridge of Helplessness.</p>
<p>Lu Bushun and company were somewhat puzzled. They didn’t know what An Tianzuo was waiting for, but An Tianzuo’s words were military orders. They didn’t dare ask further and could only continue waiting.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the sword transformed from the Sword Pill in Zhou Wen’s hand increasingly resembled Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>The more Sword Pill resembled Immortal Culling Sword, the more illusory it looked to others. It was so indiscernible that it was close to vanishing.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>A strange sword hum alarmed the talking Lu Bushun and company. Everyone turned their heads and saw Zhou Wen standing in front of the Three-Lives Stone bare-handed. There was a foot-long sword mark on the indestructible Three-Lives Stone.</p>
<p>Following that, they saw Zhou Wen move his palm in the air as though he was holding an invisible sword.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen moved his palm, the fragments scattered from the Three-Lives Stone as sword marks appeared. Soon, Zhou Wen’s name was engraved.</p>
<p>The strokes of the two words were like a sword’s edge. Every stroke was filled with terrifying sword intent. Just looking at the two words made Lu Bushun and company feel a chill run down their spines as they subconsciously took half a step back.</p>
<p>What a terrifying sword intent! After snapping to their senses, everyone realized that it was only the sword intent contained in the words.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s name was forcefully engraved on the Three-Lives Stone. It didn’t vanish like An Sheng and Ya’er’s names. It was unknown if engraving a name in such a way was effective.</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng, I’ll cross the bridge with you.” Zhou Wen retracted the Terror form Sword Pill and secretly glanced at the information on his phone.</p>
<p>Terror transformation: Incomplete Sword Pill (S-grade)</p>
<p>Although there was something wrong with the name, it was within his expectations. After all, this Terror form Sword Pill was based on the Immortal Culling Sword, not his own Sword Heart.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t because he didn’t have the luxury of time, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have chosen this path. It was safer to advance to the Terror transformation stage with a Sword Heart he could call his own.</p>
<p>“Overseer, why don’t Young Master Wen and I head over to take a look?” An Sheng requested An Tianzuo’s permission again.</p>
<p>“Does engraving a name like that count?” An Tianzuo didn’t answer An Sheng as he asked the white-haired granny.</p>
<p>“Just leaving a name would do,” the white-haired granny said calmly.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo turned around and walked towards the Three-Lives Stone. As he walked towards it, a strange figure appeared behind him.</p>
<p>It was a white humanoid armored creature. He floated behind An Tianzuo with a device similar to a rocket launcher behind him. He held a sword in one hand and a Gatling-like weapon in the other. He looked like a modern robot.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1190'>Chapter 1190: Stepping onto the Bridge</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Da! Da! Da!</p>
<p>The Gatling-like weapon swept crazily at the Three-Lives Stone as blue flames spewed out from its muzzle. When the bullets struck the Three-Lives Stone, they drilled in. Rows of bullets dotted out the words ‘An Tianzuo.’</p>
<p>“Old Zhao, you are in charge of commandeering this area. Everyone, stay put and wait for our return.” As An Tianzuo spoke, he walked towards the Bridge of Helplessness.</p>
<p>“Overseer…” Lu Bushun and An Jingyu wanted to say something, but An Tianzuo stopped them with a wave of his hand.</p>
<p>“It’s an order,” An Tianzuo said as he walked to the Bridge of Helplessness.</p>
<p>As he walked, the robot-like creature had already transformed into armor that enveloped his body.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Zhou Wen looked at An Tianzuo in surprise.</p>
<p>When the armor enveloped his body, An Tianzuo’s figure had already vanished from the eyes of ordinary people. Only Zhou Wen could still see him. Without a doubt, this was the result of his Terror transformation.</p>
<p>However, An Tianzuo himself didn’t undergo Terror transformation. Instead, the transformation came from the robot-like creature that was in the form of an armor.</p>
<p>If it was a Guardian, it would be understandable. However, it wasn’t a Guardian. There was no Guardian’s aura.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen had seen An Tianzuo use something similar in the past. It was likely his Life Soul, but this Life Soul was very different from before. This difference wasn’t completely due to the Terror transformation. There seemed to be other factors mixed in.</p>
<p>Could it be that An Tianzuo didn’t use the Mythical Serum, but allowed his Life Soul to fuse with something similar to the Mythical Serum? Zhou Wen guessed, but he wasn’t able to verify his guess.</p>
<p>“Overseer, I’ll go first. You can come up later.” An Sheng hurriedly ran over, hoping to step onto the Bridge of Helplessness before An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>However, a spoon stopped them. The white-haired granny held a bowl of soup in her other hand and said expressionlessly, “You must drink the River of Forgetfulness Soup before stepping onto the Bridge of Helplessness.”</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, An Sheng took the bowl and glanced at the billowing yellow smoke in the bowl. He raised it to his mouth and swallowed all the yellow smoke.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo looked at An Sheng from the side without stopping him. Zhou Wen, on the other hand, was extremely nervous.</p>
<p>An Sheng waited for a while and after confirming that he hadn’t lost his memories, he said to An Tianzuo, “Overseer, I’m fine. My memories are still intact. Overseer, I’ll step onto the bridge first. You can step onto the bridge when I reach the opposite bank without any problems.”</p>
<p>With that said, An Sheng stepped onto the Bridge of Helplessness and carefully walked towards the opposite bank.</p>
<p>Every few steps An Sheng took, he would turn his head and shout. However, Zhou Wen and company could only see him open his mouth without hearing anything. It was merely a short distance, but it was as though an invisible barrier had screened his voice.</p>
<p>The Bridge of Helplessness was an arched bridge. When An Sheng reached the highest point of the bridge, his body suddenly vanished as though he had stepped into another world.</p>
<p>When An Tianzuo saw this, he picked up a bowl of River of Forgetfulness Soup and downed it in one gulp. He turned to look at Zhou Wen and said, “Don’t risk Ya’er’s life. Leave her here.”</p>
<p>With that said, An Tianzuo walked onto the Bridge of Helplessness.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t let go of Ya’er. Although An Tianzuo said it for Ya’er’s sake, Zhou Wen still believed that it was safer to keep Ya’er by his side.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out to get the River of Forgetfulness Soup, but to his surprise, his hand was blocked by the white-haired granny’s spoon.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo also stopped and looked at the white-haired granny. Lu Bushun and company also surrounded her.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to drink it,” the white-haired granny said expressionlessly as she retracted her spoon.</p>
<p>“I can step onto the bridge without drinking the soup?” Zhou Wen looked at the white-haired granny in puzzlement. Lu Bushun and company were also puzzled.</p>
<p>“Yes,” the white-haired granny answered.</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“There’s no reason. You can choose not to step onto it if you don’t want to.” The white-haired granny still had that dead expression as though nothing was worthy of her being moved.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. If he had known that he didn’t need to drink the River of Forgetfulness Soup, he wouldn’t have gone through so much trouble to leave his name on the Three-Lives Stone.</p>
<p>“What about her?” Zhou Wen pointed at Ya’er in his arms.</p>
<p>The white-haired granny didn’t say a word as she handed over a bowl of River of Forgetfulness Soup.</p>
<p>Ya’er looked like a child, but her soul wasn’t. Without waiting for Zhou Wen to say anything, she took the River of Forgetfulness Soup and drank it in one mouthful.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo didn’t immediately continue forward. He watched Ya’er finish the River of Forgetfulness Soup without losing her memories before turning to walk to the other side of the bridge.</p>
<p>“If there’s any danger, head back,” Zhou Wen said to Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll run faster than anyone if there’s danger,” Li Xuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Then I’m relieved.” He turned around and carried Ya’er onto the Bridge of Helplessness.</p>
<p>To his surprise, not long after Zhou Wen went up the bridge, the antelope and Chick followed. The white-haired granny glanced at them and didn’t stop them or get them to drink the River of Forgetfulness Soup.</p>
<p>Chick landed on Zhou Wen’s shoulder as the antelope slowly followed behind him. It looked like it was on a vacation as it occasionally looked at the River of Forgetfulness under the bridge.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He never expected the antelope to follow him. He had no idea what it was up to.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen walk on the Bridge of Helplessness with the bird and antelope, Lu Bushun and company’s expressions turned odd.</p>
<p>Lu Bushun couldn’t help but run to the bridge’s end. He squeezed out a smile on his fat face and asked the white-haired granny, “Well, Granny, if they can cross the bridge without drinking the River of Forgetfulness Soup, can we do the same?”</p>
<p>The white-haired granny ignored him and tapped the bowl with her spoon. The meaning was obvious—if he wanted to step onto the bridge, he had to drink the soup first.</p>
<p>“That’s not fair. Why do we have to drink the soup when they can choose not to?” Lu Bushun deliberately said in an unhappy manner. In fact, he wanted to get the reason from the white-haired granny.</p>
<p>The white-haired granny rolled her eyes and smashed the spoon in her hand on Lu Bushun’s head, smashing his body into the mud. Only his head was exposed like a radish planted in the ground.</p>
<p>“Do you think it’s fair now?” the white-haired granny asked coldly.</p>
<p>“It’s fair. It’s very fair.” Unable to move, Lu Bushun could only squeeze out a fawning smile and nod.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked onto the Bridge of Helplessness and looked into the River of Forgetfulness. The scenery he saw was different from the scene from the bank.</p>
<p>Under the bridge wasn’t a bottomless abyss, nor was there any billowing yellow smoke. There was only a small river below. The river water was clear, and it wasn’t deep. However, beneath the bridge were piles of bones that covered the riverbed. It was like hell.</p>
<p>From the outside, it looked like there was no end to the bridge, but when he really stepped onto it, he realized that it wasn’t very long. Zhou Wen didn’t walk far before he reached the top of the bridge. Taking a step forward, the scene in front of him changed again.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1191'>Chapter 1191: Six Realms</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen had heard many ghost stories from his grandfather since he was young. Many of them were about the Netherworld.</p>
<p>He had heard plenty of stories about Yama’s Hall, Lord Yama, the judges, and small ghosts, etc. In Zhou Wen’s impression, he would be at Fengdu City after crossing the Bridge of Helplessness.</p>
<p>Fengdu City was also the legendary Ghost City. Legend had it that the ten Yama Kings lived in Fengdu City.</p>
<p>There was an earlier Ghost Thearch, Lord of the Earth, who also lived in Fengdu City. However, in myths and legends, his residence was called Ghostly Capital.</p>
<p>Regardless of which legend it was, one should be able to see some legendary eminences and a ghost city after crossing the Bridge of Helplessness. However, the scene Zhou Wen saw when he stood on the Bridge of Helplessness was somewhat different from what he had imagined.</p>
<p>There was no Fengdu City or Yama Palace—not even a small temple.</p>
<p>On the other side of the Bridge of Helplessness, there were only six huge doors. On them were the words “Devas Realm,” “Asura Realm,” “Hell Realm,” “Hungry Ghost Realm,” “Animal Realm,” and “Human Realm.”</p>
<p>An Sheng and An Tianzuo were standing in front of the six doors, as though they were hesitating about which door to enter.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked over with Ya’er in his arms. An Sheng and An Tianzuo weren’t too surprised when they saw Chick and the antelope coming over. In the past five years, Chick and the antelope had exhibited many strange phenomena when they followed An Jing, who was impersonating Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when Zhou Wen hadn’t been around, An Sheng had been in charge of taking care of them. With An Sheng’s meticulousness, how could he not discover the strangeness of the antelope?</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen walk over, An Sheng said, “These six gates should be the legendary Six Realms of Rebirth. Legend has it that ghosts will reincarnate when they enter, but it doesn’t say what will happen when living people enter.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said, “If this is really the land of the six realms of rebirth and existence, with so many creatures dying every day on Earth, this place would have long been filled with ghosts. How can it be so quiet? It’s probably just a dimensional zone.”</p>
<p>An Sheng nodded slightly. “Although that’s the case, since there are six paths, it’s very likely that there’s a taboo power that corresponds to the six realms of rebirth and existence. We have to be wary of that. Furthermore, we don’t know which door Madam and the others entered. If we try them one by one, it will waste too much time.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sized up the six doors and said, “In theory, entering the Mortal Realm door is naturally the most normal choice.”</p>
<p>“She would not choose the Human Realm,” An Tianzuo, who had been silent all this while, suddenly said.</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo didn’t answer. An Sheng hurriedly explained, “Madam’s personality is somewhat different from ordinary people. If it were an ordinary person, they would definitely choose the most reliable Human Realm. However, if it were Madam, she would definitely think of something else. Perhaps she would think an obvious hint like the Human Realm is a trap, and choose another door.”</p>
<p>“Of course, this is only an example. In fact, Madam might go one step deeper. With her personality, the possibility of her choosing to enter the Human Realm is indeed very low,” An Sheng added.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that what An Sheng said made sense. From the looks of it, Ouyang Lan was indeed an unpredictable person.</p>
<p>The first time Zhou Wen went to her place to eat, she had hoodwinked her daughter. Zhou Wen was truly alarmed back then.</p>
<p>“Then which door would Sis Lan choose?” Zhou Wen sized up the other five doors.</p>
<p>His understanding of Ouyang Lan was limited. He really couldn’t guess which path she would choose.</p>
<p>“This… Didn’t I just say that Madam has a unique personality? It’s really difficult to guess which path she took,” An Sheng said helplessly as he spread out his hands.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo suddenly said, “Although her personality is strange and unique, she’s definitely not the type to act rashly without any reason. She will definitely choose a path that we can guess.”</p>
<p>An Sheng looked at An Tianzuo and asked, “Overseer, in your opinion, which path would Madam choose?”</p>
<p>“I’m thinking about it,” An Tianzuo answered.</p>
<p>An Sheng looked at the doors and said, “I doubt it would be the Beast Realm. Madam is someone who loves beauty, so it’s impossible for her to have any desire of becoming another creature. The Hungry Ghost Realm and the Hell Realm are collectively known as the Three Evils with the Beast Realm. They aren’t great candidates either. I believe the chances of Madam choosing them aren’t high. The remaining Devas Realm and Asura Realm seem to be possible. Typically, ordinary people would choose the Heaven Realm that legends foretell good fortune, but with Madam’s personality, she might also choose the Asura Realm.”</p>
<p>“What kind of place is the Asura Realm in legends?” Zhou Wen only knew the name of six realms, so he didn’t understand it in detail.</p>
<p>“The Asura Realm is a fiendish path. Typically, when one sinks into the fiendish path, it refers to the Asura Realm. However, the Asura Realm is also listed as one of the Three Goods. The reason is very complicated. I don’t understand it in detail either,” An Sheng explained.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo looked at the door of the Asura Realm and said, “Asuras spread across the six realms. There’s Deva Asuras in the Devas Realm, Human Asuras in the Human Realm, Hell Asuras in the Hell Realm, and Hungry Ghost Asuras in the Hungry Ghost Realm. Asuras are different across the different realms. The only similarity is that Asuras are warlike. It’s the same no matter which realm they are in.”</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng, you’re right. With her personality, she most likely chose the Asura Realm. Furthermore, she can only choose the Asura Realm,” An Tianzuo said as he walked towards the door of the Asura Realm.</p>
<p>“Why?” An Sheng asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Although the possibility of Devas Realm was smaller, it wasn’t impossible.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo said without turning his head, “That’s because she doesn’t have a good impression of things with the character ‘tian’ after watching a particular battle1 in the past. She even wanted to change the ‘tian’ in my name, so she definitely wouldn’t choose the Devas Realm.”</p>
<p>“Which battle? Why don’t I know?” An Sheng asked.</p>
<p>However, An Tianzuo didn’t answer him as he walked through the door of the Asura Realm.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also somewhat curious as to which battle made Ouyang Lan dislike the character “tian.”</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, let’s go in as well.” When An Sheng saw that An Tianzuo had vanished, he called out to Zhou Wen and immediately rushed through the Asura Realm’s door.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to follow him in, he suddenly felt a force pulling at his clothes, pulling him to the other side.</p>
<p>Looking down, he saw the antelope biting the corner of his shirt and pulling him to the other side.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Zhou Wen asked the antelope.</p>
<p>The antelope wrote a few words on the ground with its hooves. “Ouyang Lan didn’t enter the Asura Realm. Follow me.”</p>
<p>“How do you know that she didn’t enter the Asura Realm?” Zhou Wen didn’t believe the antelope as he stared at him and asked.</p>
<p>“Why do you think Ouyang Lan entered this place?” the antelope asked in return.</p>
<p>“She was forced to enter after encountering danger,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“Since she knows that there’s danger and knows that you will definitely come to save her, she will guess that An Tianzuo will think that she entered the Asura Realm. If she enters the Asura Realm, it’s very likely that you will face the same danger. What do you think she would choose?” the antelope said.</p>
<p>“You mean that in order to prevent us from being in danger, she would do the opposite and take a path that An Tianzuo would never think of?” Zhou Wen immediately understood the antelope’s intentions and couldn’t help but look at the Devas Realm.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo had said that Ouyang Lan hated the character “tian.” It was impossible for her to choose the Devas Realm. If the antelope’s deduction was right, Ouyang Lan had most likely entered the Devas Realm.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1192'>Chapter 1192: Deva</h3>
<p>Although this was only the antelope’s guess, Zhou Wen felt that it made sense. Since An Tianzuo and company had entered the Asura Realm, it was a form of double insurance if he headed for the Deva Realm.</p>
<p>The antelope led the way into the Deva Realm as Zhou Wen followed, carrying Ya’er as he led Chick.</p>
<p>The Deva Realm’s door was like water. The moment Zhou Wen’s body touched the door, he sank in and arrived in front of a huge mountain.</p>
<p>How big could a mountain be? In Zhou Wen’s imagination, the largest was an existence like the Himalayas.</p>
<p>But the mountain in front of him gave Zhou Wen the feeling that there was no end or peak. Looking left and right, he couldn’t see the land beyond the mountain. Looking up, he couldn’t see the top that penetrated the clouds.</p>
<p>Then, Zhou Wen realized that he was actually very far from the mountain. It was only because the mountain was so huge that it gave an oppressive feeling, making him feel like he was at its base.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen used teleportation to arrive near the mountain. However, despite doing so several times, he was astonished to discover that the mountain remained so far away. It was as though he hadn’t approached it in any way.</p>
<p>“Walk over.” The antelope wrote on the sand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded and carried Ya’er forward. After walking for a short distance, he suddenly saw a figure fly over.</p>
<p>“A Fairy?” Zhou Wen sized up the figure in the air—an extremely beautiful woman. Her clothes fluttered like an otherworldly fairy, but she had the aura of a dimensional creature. She was somewhat similar to the Fairies Zhou Wen had seen before.</p>
<p>There was a strange glow over the Fairy-like woman’s body, making her skin look moist and crystalline like milk.</p>
<p>“It’s a Deva.” The antelope wrote on the ground.</p>
<p>“You’ve really been here before?” Zhou Wen asked the antelope.</p>
<p>The antelope didn’t answer, but the female Deva had already flown over. Before Zhou Wen could decide what to do, Chick spat out a golden flame and burned the female Deva to ashes.</p>
<p>An Essence Energy Crystal dropped from the sky and landed in the sand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen picked up the Essence Energy Crystal and looked at it on his phone. He realized that it was a 64-valued Essence Energy Crystal. Clearly, the female Deva had been at the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>The group continued walking forward and soon saw a few more Devas. There were men and women among them. All of them were extremely handsome, and they were Mythical creatures.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Chick thought nothing of the beauty. It spewed out golden flames and burned all the Devas it saw to death. Two more crystals dropped. One of them was an 80-valued Constitution Crystal, allowing Zhou Wen to boost his stats.</p>
<p>Although he had advanced to the Mythical stage for quite some time, his stats hadn’t maxed out. Up to now, only one of his stats had reached 81 points.</p>
<p>“These Devas are clearly at the Mythical stage. Why do they look so weak?” Zhou Wen asked the antelope in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Although Chick was very strong, those Devas were at the Mythical stage after all. It didn’t seem reasonable for them to be burned to death without any resistance.</p>
<p>The antelope curled its lips and wrote on the ground, “Weak? In a while, you will know if they are weak or strong.”</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen asked again, the antelope didn’t say anything else and walked towards the mountain.</p>
<p>Along the way, they encountered a few more Devas which were burned to death by Chick. These Devas weren’t the fastest nor were they strong. They lined the bottom of the Mythical stage, similar to the Mythical fake immortals in Deer Terrace Pavilion, only weaker.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen previously hadn’t managed to come close to the mountain despite teleporting several times, but he was now getting closer and closer to the foot of the mountain. Just as he was about to reach the foot of the mountain, he suddenly saw a red-dressed female Deva surrounded by red flowers.</p>
<p>After discovering Zhou Wen and company, the female Deva flew over. Chick spat out a golden flame without any mercy.</p>
<p>However, this time, Chick’s flames failed to burn the female Deva to death. She actually dodged Chick’s flames.</p>
<p>Chick flapped its wings angrily and rushed forward to spew out more golden flames.</p>
<p>However, the female Deva’s movement technique was outstanding. She danced in flight, dodging all of Chick’s flaming attacks.</p>
<p>When she danced, the red glow over her body flowed like petals. It looked extremely beautiful. When Chick rushed over, it touched the red light petals, causing the petals to automatically vanish like bubbles.</p>
<p>The female Deva only dodged without counterattacking. She didn’t seem to take the initiative to attack.</p>
<p>After watching for a while, Zhou Wen became more and more puzzled. This female Deva’s movement technique was very good, and even on par with Zhou Wen’s former Transcendent Flying Immortal movement technique, but Chick’s movement technique and speed were higher than female Deva’s. With them both being at the Mythical stage, it didn’t make sense that Chick failed to finish her after so long.</p>
<p>However, the truth was that the female Deva easily dodged all of Chick’s attacks, making Zhou Wen frown.</p>
<p>This was no longer a matter of movement techniques or speed. Zhou Wen had already noticed that the female Deva had strangely dodged Chick’s attack several times in virtually impossible situations.</p>
<p>Chick looked like it was about to succeed several times, but still failed. Its ferocious nature was immediately triggered. It raised its head and let out a long cry as golden light emitted from its mouth. Golden flames spewed out like a tidal wave, turning into a surging sea of flames that enveloped a large area, burning the female Deva to ashes on the spot.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the female Deva didn’t leave anything behind.</p>
<p>How strange. Do the Devas here not hurt people? Zhou Wen frowned in thought.</p>
<p>From the battle just now, the female Deva hadn’t launched any attacks from beginning to end. It wasn’t that she hadn’t had a chance, but it was as though she had no intention of attacking. This was the first time Zhou Wen had seen such a dimensional creature.</p>
<p>“She has already attacked. It’s just that you didn’t see it. If it were any other Mythical creature fighting her, this wouldn’t be the situation you’re seeing.” The antelope wrote on the ground.</p>
<p>She’s not at the Terror grade. There’s no reason why I can’t see her attack. Even if she is at the Terror grade, I should be able to see her… Wait… Could her attack be the red light over her body? Zhou Wen immediately understood that there was definitely something wrong with the red light. It was only because Chick’s physique was too strong that it hadn’t been affected.</p>
<p>“This is just the beginning. The fun lies ahead.” After the antelope finished writing, it headed for the mountain.</p>
<p>Before long, he saw another Deva that emitted a red glow. However, this time, it was a man. Chick went up to fight again.</p>
<p>Just like before, the Deva dodged the attacks that certainly should have hit several times. It infuriated Chick to spew out a sea of flames, burning the Deva to ashes.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1193'>Chapter 1193: Devas’ Ability</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Although Chick still wielded the absolute advantage, it was very odd that Chick, who was nearly invincible among its peers, found it so difficult to deal with a Mythical creature.</p>
<p>Although there weren’t many Devas here, they weren’t rare. The glowing-red Devas weren’t a rare species, so Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised that they could fight Chick to such an extent.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already noticed that the problem lay with the Devas’ movement technique. After plenty of observation, Zhou Wen still couldn’t figure out what the strange movement technique was.</p>
<p>As he walked up the mountain path, he quickly saw another glowing-red Deva appear. Chick no longer had its previous spirit. Although the expenditure was nothing to it, fighting glowing-red Devas left Chick somewhat depressed. It no longer charged forward eagerly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to figure out what was going on with the glowing-red Devas’ movement techniques, so he summoned two Golden Battle God Halberds and made them fly towards the glowing-red Deva in a pincer attack.</p>
<p>The Golden Battle God Halberd was extremely sharp. Its offensive strength was rather good among Mythical creatures, but they were just too clumsy. The two Golden Battle God Halberds failed to touch the Red-Flow Deva in their pincer attack.</p>
<p>At the same time, a strange scene happened. In the battle, red rust appeared on the Golden Battle God Halberd’s golden body. Furthermore, the red rust increased, making the two originally golden divine weapons look like scrap metal that had been thrown in a pile for years.</p>
<p>Is this the glowing-red Deva’s ability? Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated. He had never seen such an ability. Thankfully, Chick could resist this power; otherwise, the outcome would be unimaginable.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>A rusted Golden Battle God Halberd smashed at the glowing-red Deva, but it missed him. Then, it failed to stop in time and smashed into the mountain wall beside him. The Golden Battle God Halberd snapped and Zhou Wen lost a Mythical Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, what’s going on? Zhou Wen widened his eyes. After all, that was a Mythical creature. To shatter from smashing into a rock was somewhat bizarre.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen finally understood what the antelope meant. It wasn’t that these Devas weren’t strong, but their strength was different from ordinary dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>“What kind of power is this?” Zhou Wen retreated a distance to ensure that he wasn’t affected by the red glow before asking the antelope.</p>
<p>He was ultimately at the Mythical stage. Although he had the strength of the Terror grade, he hadn’t reached the Terror grade. It was best to be careful. Before figuring out what the strange power was, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to be touched.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Before the antelope could answer, the other Golden Battle God Halberd broke due to the excessive rust. It made Zhou Wen feel the pinch of losing two Mythical Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Although it was relatively easy to have Golden Battle God Halberds drop, and Zhou Wen still had two of them on him, their skills were still pretty good. No one would complain about having too many of the necessary skills in a combined attack.</p>
<p>After the Golden Battle God Halberds died, the glowing-red Deva flew towards Zhou Wen again. Now, looking at the red glow that appeared to be dancing like flowers over her body, Zhou Wen didn’t find it beautiful. He felt horrified.</p>
<p>Not daring to let the glowing-red Deva approach, Zhou Wen summoned Banana Fairy. She blew out a gust of Supreme Yin Wind, freezing the glowing-red Deva in midair before she slammed into the mountain wall. Her body was reduced to ice shards and she died on the spot.</p>
<p>A Companion Egg that suffused a red glow dropped. Zhou Wen was delighted as he hurriedly picked it up and incubated it.</p>
<p>A Mythical Companion Egg wasn’t enough to delight Zhou Wen. However, with this Companion Egg, he could know what stats and skills a Deva had. It would be of great help to his future plans.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen refused to believe that there wasn’t a Terror-grade Deva in a place like this. If he could figure out what the abilities a Terror-grade Deva had before encountering one and the way to restrain them, the danger would be greatly minimized.</p>
<p>With the injection of Essence Energy, the glowing-red Deva Companion Beast transformed into a red stream of light that rushed into Zhou Wen’s body, forming a picture of a Fairy on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had already received some information from the Fairy, he still looked at the mysterious phone’s data. He was more used to getting direct data.</p>
<p>Crimson Deva: Mythical</p>
<p>Life Providence: Deva Blessing</p>
<p>Life Soul: Crimson Body Glow</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Lesser Deva’s Five Signs of Decay</p>
<p>Strength: 63</p>
<p>Speed: 78</p>
<p>Constitution: 62</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 71</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Fairy, Luck, Fortune</p>
<p>Companion Form: Deva Robe</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen had studied all the abilities of the Crimson Deva, he finally understood why Chick had failed to hit her so many times.</p>
<p>Not only was a Crimson Deva’s movement technique good, but what was even more terrifying was that it had powers like Luck, Blessings, and Fortune. Although these abilities didn’t seem to have any offensive power, their effects were definitely terrifying.</p>
<p>As for the Wheel of Destiny ability—Deva’s Five Signs of Decay—became even more ridiculous when combined with abilities like Luck and Fortune.</p>
<p>Deva’s Five Signs of Decay could make an enemy unlucky. Not only would they be unlucky, but they would also age and perish.</p>
<p>With the enemy becoming unlucky, while they enjoyed good luck and fortune, it was obvious how difficult it would be for an opponent to hit them.</p>
<p>Although this Crimson Deva isn’t strong in combat, these skills and abilities are really strong. If skills like Luck and Fortune can be transferred to a combat pet, it will be even better. Zhou Wen finally understood why a Crimson Deva could sometimes dodge attacks in an unbelievable manner. It wasn’t because their movement techniques were good, but because their opponent was unlucky while they were very lucky.</p>
<p>The only pity was that the Luck and Fortune skills of a Crimson Deva were only effective on themselves and wouldn’t affect the people around them.</p>
<p>Everything else is fine. No matter how lucky she is, she won’t be able to dodge area-of-effect attacks. However, this Deva’s Five Signs of Decay is somewhat troublesome, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Legend had it that Deva’s Five Signs of Decay was an ominous omen before the death of a Deva. It was also divided into a Lesser and Greater Deva’s Five Signs of Decay. Now, it had become the Wheel of Destiny ability of a Deva.</p>
<p>Just the power of the Lesser Deva’s Five Signs of Decay was strange enough. If he encountered a Greater Deva’s Five Signs of Decay or a Terror-grade Deva, perhaps a single Deva’s Five Signs of Decay would plague them with bad luck. They would be unlucky and die without knowing why.</p>
<p>What kind of power can crack the Deva’s Five Signs of Decay? Zhou Wen carefully ran through the list of Companion Beasts he had.</p>
<p>Among the few at the Terror grade, Banana Fairy likely didn’t have a promoting and inhibiting relationship with Deva’s Five Signs of Decay. Ice Maiden was about the same. Jade Rabbit and the Seven Seas Dragon King were most likely going to be inhibited.</p>
<p>There didn’t seem to be any power that could restrain the Deva’s Five Signs of Decay. Truth Listener was the one most likely to inhibit it.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Among Zhou Wen’s few powers, perhaps only the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder was useful.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1194'>Chapter 1194: Terror Deva</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen planned on experimenting on a Crimson Deva to see if Truth Listener and Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder were of any use.</p>
<p>It was better to try it on a Mythical Crimson Deva than a Terror-grade Deva.</p>
<p>He continued walking along the mountain path, hoping to find another Crimson Deva. However, after walking for a short while, he saw a female Deva emitting a lotus-like golden light flying towards him.</p>
<p>As he hadn’t seen the gold-glowing Deva enter her Terror transformation, Zhou Wen didn’t know if she was at the Terror-level. He hesitated without charging forward. Instead, he summoned the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General and made it charge at her.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to give it a try. He wanted to see if the attributes of Deva’s Five Signs of Decay, Luck, and Fortune were effective against the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, a Companion Beast filled with negative powers.</p>
<p>In any case, the Jinxes Master skill was a sore point for Zhou Wen. He wouldn’t feel the pinch even if the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General died.</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General charged forward, brandishing the Demonic Spear to stab at the gold-glowing Deva. Like the others, she did not attack; she only circled around the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General and dodged its attack.</p>
<p>However, the golden lotus flower that emitted from her body fused into the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s body upon contact. It was probably the same as the ability of the Crimson Deva. It had the effects of the Deva’s Five Signs of Decay, but it was unknown if it was the Lesser or Greater version.</p>
<p>After a while, Zhou Wen revealed a look of pleasant surprise. Not only was the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General unaffected by the gold-glowing Deva, but the demonic purple flames in its body became even more exuberant due to the infusion of the golden lotus.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, not only can the Deva’s Five Signs of Decay not bring misfortune to the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, but it will also accelerate his strengthening. Zhou Wen observed for a while and found the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General becoming stronger and stronger. The gold-glowing Deva was in a sorry state from the pursuit, with several wounds over her body.</p>
<p>Her Deva’s Five Signs of Decay didn’t have much effect on the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. Luck and Fortune skills didn’t seem to be of much use either. They were completely restrained by the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>Before long, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General slew the gold-glowing Deva with his spear. Unfortunately, nothing dropped.</p>
<p>The gold-glowing Deva’s speed and strength were stronger than the Crimson Deva, but it was still within the range of the Mythical stage. It hadn’t reached the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Knowing that the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General could also restrain Deva’s Five Signs of Decay, Zhou Wen felt much better. He charged forward with the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General and later encountered several Crimson Devas and gold-glowing Devas.</p>
<p>After experimenting, Zhou Wen found that although Truth Listener’s Evil Annihilation was effective against the Deva’s Five Signs of Decay, it couldn’t completely eliminate it.</p>
<p>As for the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, it could perfectly restrain the Deva’s Five Signs of Decay. As long as he activated the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, the Devas didn’t pose any harm to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>This put Zhou Wen at greater ease. Even if he encountered a Terror-grade Deva, he would be invincible against them.</p>
<p>However, along the way, Zhou Wen didn’t discover any clues related to Ouyang Lan. This made him suspect if Ouyang Lan had come to Deva Realm.</p>
<p>“Were we wrong? Did Sis Lan predict that An Tianzuo would have the same thought process as us, so she did the opposite and went to the Asura Realm?” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>The antelope looked at the mountain path ahead and wrote on the ground, “It’s also possible. However, we are already here. Don’t you want to go up and take a look?”</p>
<p>“You are the one who wants to go up, right? What’s up there?” Zhou Wen felt that the antelope might not have taken this path to save Ouyang Lan from the beginning.</p>
<p>The antelope seemed to know that it had to say something. It wrote, “There’s something on the mountain that can help Chick complete a Terror transformation. Even if the person you are looking for isn’t there, this trip won’t be for nothing.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” Zhou Wen continued asking.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure if that thing is still there. Let’s go up and take a look first.” The antelope refused to say anything as it continued walking with its head lowered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and followed. He wasn’t sure if Ouyang Lan had come to Deva Realm, but since he was already here, he decided to continue his search.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen walked, he carved on the Wheel of Destiny, maintaining his Terror form to deal with any unexpected situations.</p>
<p>With the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General leading the way, he killed quite a number of Crimson Devas and a few gold-glowing Devas. A skill crystal dropped from a Crimson Deva.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t immediately absorb it. Instead, he put it away and continued on the path.</p>
<p>It was unknown how high the mountain was. Zhou Wen estimated that they had already climbed a few thousand meters, but they still couldn’t see the peak. It was difficult to imagine how huge the mountain was.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General killed another gold-glowing Deva and a Companion Egg dropped.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted as he picked up the Companion Egg and hatched it. The Companion Beast he hatched was called Golden Deva.</p>
<p>The Golden Deva’s attributes were very similar to that of Crimson Immortal. The only difference was that its Life Soul was called Golden Body Glow. The other attributes were basically the same.</p>
<p>Even the Wheel of Destiny was the Lesser Deva’s Five Signs of Decay. The Greater Deva’s Five Signs of Decay that Zhou Wen had expected didn’t appear.</p>
<p>He continued on his way and when he arrived at a platform, Zhou Wen’s heart couldn’t help but skip a beat. He saw a divine altar on the platform. Sitting on it was a Deva. The Deva was clearly different from the previous ones.</p>
<p>The glow over his body was black. Furthermore, without using the Wheel of Destiny, he couldn’t be seen.</p>
<p>Terror-grade Deva! Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated. He originally wanted the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to return, but to his surprise, it charged forward as though it could see the Terror-grade Deva.</p>
<p>The Devas from before didn’t seem to attack, but the black-glowing Deva was different. Just as the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General charged over, he threw a slap.</p>
<p>A black beam tore out of his palm and instantly struck the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, sending it flying back. He slammed into the mountain wall, and his fiend armor caved in.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw this, he hurriedly retracted the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. Although he had the urge to kill it at times, he couldn’t stand seeing it suffer serious injuries.</p>
<p>After condensing the Sword Pill, Zhou Wen used the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and used Clown Mask to teleport. He arrived behind the black-glowing Deva and slashed at his head.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the black-glowing Deva turned his body in a seemingly prescient move and dodged Zhou Wen’s strike.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated, but he didn’t stop. As he constantly teleported, he thrust out Sword Pill again and again. Every strike was extremely bizarre, making it impossible to dodge.</p>
<p>Strangely, no matter how fast Zhou Wen’s teleportation was or how accurate his strike was, it was dodged by the black-glowing Deva. It was as though he could predict the future. He could dodge any of Zhou Wen’s attacks ahead of time. No matter how fast the sword was, it was difficult for it to injure him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1195'>Chapter 1195: Another Companion Egg</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed. This was the result of the Heaven-Opening Scripture’s protection. From the Essence Energy that was rapidly converted by the Heaven-Opening Scripture, he could tell how terrifying the black-glowing Deva’s Five Signs of Decay was.</p>
<p>If it were anyone else, not only would they not be able to hit the black-glowing Deva, but they would probably have their lives taken by the power of the Deva’s Five Signs of Decay.</p>
<p>None of his hits connected. Zhou Wen’s sword technique was already as fast as lightning, but he couldn’t touch even a strand of the black-glowing Deva’s hair.</p>
<p>How can I crack the black-glowing Deva’s Luck and Fortune skill? Zhou Wen knew that if he couldn’t crack it, it was useless no matter how fast his sword was.</p>
<p>The opposite of luck is misfortune or bad luck. Speaking of bad luck, Tai Sui should be the best choice. However, Tai Sui’s combat strength isn’t strong. It’s fine against microorganisms, but it probably won’t be of much use against a Deva. Furthermore, this is a Terror-grade Deva. A Mythical Tai Sui is probably useless… As Zhou Wen thought, he suddenly had an idea and took out the Bamboo Blade.</p>
<p>Bamboo Blade was one of the Four Gentlemen Blades. Legend had it that it was a blade with the curse of misfortune. It was unknown if it was of any use.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen could only make a last-ditch effort. He didn’t have any other solutions. If it still didn’t work, he would have to get Banana Fairy to take action and see if an area-of-effect attack was effective against the black-glowing Deva.</p>
<p>However, after slashing a few times, he failed to injure the black-glowing Deva. Just as Zhou Wen was feeling disappointed, the Bamboo Blade tore through the black-glowing Deva’s sleeve.</p>
<p>Eh, looks like it’s still useful. Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he injected his Terror powers into the Bamboo Blade and slashed at the black-glowing Deva again and again.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen realized that the chances of the Bamboo Blade hitting the black-glowing Deva were very low. It took more than a hundred strikes to hit, and it was very difficult to strike a vital spot.</p>
<p>Even so, Zhou Wen was overjoyed. As long as he could touch the black-glowing Deva, there was a chance of killing him. It was better than nothing.</p>
<p>If a hundred slashes didn’t work, he would use a thousand slashes. If a thousand slashes didn’t work, he would use ten thousand slashes. There would come a time when he could successfully kill him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal was already fast enough. Coupled with the Clown Mask’s teleportation ability, it was unbelievably fast. Blade beams flashed as though they were slashing at the black-glowing Deva from all directions. It was unknown how many strikes he had delivered.</p>
<p>The wounds on the black-glowing Deva gradually increased. Although they weren’t vital spots, they still affected him. In the end, the black-glowing Deva’s body was covered in blade wounds—suffering a death from abrasions.</p>
<p>A unique Terror-grade creature was killed by Zhou Wen just like that. All that was left was a pile of white bones. Its flesh had been sliced clean.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wish to be so cruel, but he had no choice. He wouldn’t have been able to kill the black-glowing Deva if not for this strategy.</p>
<p>With a clang, a Companion Egg that emitted a black glow dropped out of black-glowing Deva’s body, delighting Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>A Terror-grade Companion Egg! Zhou Wen hurriedly picked up the Companion Egg. He never expected it to come so easily. Furthermore, the black-glowing Deva’s ability was very special. It would definitely be of great use in the future.</p>
<p>The Companion Egg’s black glow flowed as though it contained infinite mystery. Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate to hatch it.</p>
<p>As large amounts of Essence Energy surged in, the Companion Beast transformed into a black stream of light that entered Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly took out his phone and looked at the information inside.</p>

<p>So the Greater Deva’s Five Signs of Decay is the power of the Terror transformation. It’s no wonder I didn’t see it on the Golden Deva or the Crimson Deva. However, this fellow is actually called Deva Asura. That’s Asura of the Deva race… Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be overjoyed when he saw his stats.</p>
<p>His companion form is a saber. If I use the saber transformed from Deva Asura to slay other Deva Asuras, what will happen with the augmentation of Luck and Fortune? Zhou Wen thought as he summoned Deva Asura in its saber form.</p>
<p>The Asura Saber was a long and narrow saber that was slightly curved. It was pitch-black, but it suffused a cold glow. It looked cold and mysterious, like the arc of the moon left behind during a lunar eclipse.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the saber and continued walking up the mountain. He couldn’t wait to see if it could restrain Deva Asuras.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen and company encountered another Deva. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a Deva Asura, but a Crimson Deva.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen slashed out with the Asura Saber, slaying the Crimson Deva under his blade. Zhou Wen didn’t use much strength and even deliberately held back. Yet, the Crimson Deva was still beheaded in one strike.</p>
<p>It’s indeed useful. Zhou Wen still wanted to know if it was effective against Deva Asuras. He continued walking up the mountain.</p>
<p>At first, he didn’t wish to encounter Devas, but now, he couldn’t wait to meet them. However, he only encountered some Crimson Devas and Golden Devas. He didn’t encounter Deva Asuras.</p>
<p>After slaying eleven Devas, quite a number of stat crystals dropped, but he didn’t obtain any Companion Eggs or see a Deva Asura. This left Zhou Wen somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>As he walked forward, he suddenly saw a tree growing on the mountain wall in front of him.</p>
<p>Ever since Zhou Wen and company had entered the Deva Realm, they hadn’t seen any plants. There was sand and mountain rocks everywhere. But not a single blade of grass grew.</p>
<p>However, there was a crooked tree growing on the mountain wall in front of him. The crooked tree’s roots were embedded in the mountain wall, and the tree’s body was hanging outside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what type of tree it was, but he could see that there were some red fruits on it. The fruits were about the size of a fist and looked a little like the fruits of a paper mulberry tree.</p>
<p>When the antelope saw the tree and fruits, its eyes immediately lit up. As for Chick, it was even more direct. It flapped its wings and flew towards the tree.</p>
<p>The antelope pressed Chick down from the sky with its hoof and wrote on the ground with its other hoof, “That tree is extraordinary. It has already entered the saint stage and can’t be easily desecrated.”</p>
<p>“That tree is what you are looking for?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“The tree is useless. The fruit on the tree is what’s very useful. I never expected it to still be there, but it’s somewhat difficult to pluck them.” The antelope continued writing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the fruit on the tree and frowned slightly. If even a Calamity-grade like the antelope said it was difficult, then it was truly difficult.</p>
<p>“What are those fruits? How can I pluck them?” Zhou Wen looked for a while and didn’t discover any danger, leaving him puzzled.</p>
<p>There were no Devas near the tree, nor were there any other dimensional creatures. If the fruits on the tree were so precious, why didn’t the numerous Devas not pluck the fruits? Why would they still be there?</p>
<h3 id='chapter1196'>Chapter 1196: Meru Mustard Seed</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“Do you know what mountain this is?” The antelope wrote down a question in return.</p>
<p>“No.” Zhou Wen had no idea what mountain it was. He had never been here before, nor were there any rock monuments at the foot of the mountain stating its name.</p>
<p>“The terror of being uneducated. Since you know that this is the Deva Realm, have you never heard of Mount Meru?” The antelope wore a disdainful expression.</p>
<p>“This is Mount Meru? Then is the mountaintop where the legendary Śakra Buddha lives?” Zhou Wen looked up at the mountaintop, but he still couldn’t see its end.</p>
<p>“You sure read too much into things. That’s not something you should be thinking about now. It’s best that you come up with a way to pluck the fruit.” The antelope continued writing. “Since you’ve heard of the word Meru, you should know of the Meru Mustard Seed.”</p>
<p>“This… I don’t think I’ve taken note of this word… What does Meru Mustard Seed mean?” Zhou Wen really hadn’t kept abreast of such knowledge. Mount Meru was something he had chanced upon when reading Buddhist scriptures. He had only read it as a story without studying it in detail.</p>
<p>The antelope was somewhat astounded as it explained, “Mustard Seed refers to an extremely tiny space. Meru refers to Mount Meru. Meru Mustard Seed refers to a tiny space that can accommodate a mountain.”</p>
<p>“A storage space?” Zhou Wen immediately thought of a word.</p>
<p>“Something like that. It’s mostly that.” The antelope nodded slightly.</p>
<p>“What has this got to do with that crooked tree?” Zhou Wen sized up the tree again.</p>
<p>“That’s a Mustard Tree. The fruit on it is the Mustard Seed,” the antelope answered.</p>
<p>“The fruit is a Mustard Seed? Didn’t you say that the Mustard Seed is extremely small? Why is the fruit so big?” Zhou Wen found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>“Who told you that the fruit is a mustard seed?” The antelope wrote in disdain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was first taken aback before he understood what the antelope meant. He stared at the fruit and said, “You mean that there are many mustard seeds in that fruit?”</p>
<p>“A mustard seed can hold one Mount Meru. There are many mustard seeds in the fruit. If you reach out to pluck them, you will immediately fall into an endless space. You might not be able to escape even if it takes the rest of your life.”</p>
<p>“Then how do I pluck it?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. If it was that easy to pluck it, it wouldn’t still be there. Even a Calamity-grade creature might not be able to escape if it fell into the endless Meru pocket space,” the antelope said.</p>
<p>“If you don’t even know how to pluck it, what’s the point of bringing us here?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“Solutions are thought up by people. You are also considered a person, so can’t you use your brain?” The antelope rolled its eyes at him.</p>
<p>“It’s not like I want that mustard seed fruit. I’m only here to find someone. Why should I think about it? If you want it, think of a solution yourself.” Zhou Wen ignored the antelope and prepared to leave the mountain.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Ouyang Lan hadn’t come here at all. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for them to leave no traces when they passed by Deva Asura.</p>
<p>Even if they had a way to avoid fighting Deva Asura, they should have left some traces from using their skills. However, there was nothing along the way.</p>
<p>“If Chick eats those fruits, it can advance to the Terror grade.” The antelope wrote calmly.</p>
<p>“Chick has fire-elemental attributes. If it wants to eat it, it should be eating Fire Dragon Fruits. Why would it eat something that clearly has spatial attributes?” Zhou Wen felt that the antelope was trying to trick him into plucking the Mustard Fruit.</p>
<p>The antelope patiently explained, “You’re right that phoenixes are fire-elemental, but have you ever thought about why phoenixes can constantly undergo Nirvana Rebirth without truly dying?”</p>
<p>“Phoenix’s Nirvana and resurrection are naturally fire-elemental abilities. What’s there to say?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“From this, it can be seen that you don’t understand phoenixes at all. It’s too superficial. Fire represents destruction and an end, as well as a new life. However, a phoenix’s Nirvana can’t just rely on the renewal power of fire.”</p>
<p>The antelope pointed at the Mustard Fruit and continued writing, “A Mustard Fruit is a Mustard Seed World. A thousand Mustard Seed Worlds make a small chiliocosm. A thousand small chiliocosms make a medium dichiliocosm. A thousand medium dichiliocosms makes a great trichiliocosm. Look at how many Mustard Fruits there are on that tree.”</p>
<p>“Three,” Zhou Wen said after taking a look at the Mustard Tree and confirming it.</p>
<p>“Three Mustard Fruits represent the three thousand worlds. If Chick can swallow three Mustard Fruits, it will obtain the spatial powers of the three thousand worlds. Only then can it truly obtain the ability to undergo nirvana and be reborn. As the saying goes, there are no rootless fruits in the world. If it wants to undergo nirvana and be reborn, it needs to have some kindling. If Chick leaves kindling in the three thousand worlds, then it will have the possibility of nirvana and rebirth in the future.” The antelope wrote.</p>
<p>“Is that so?” Zhou Wen stared at the antelope, momentarily unsure if it was bluffing him or telling the truth.</p>
<p>“It’s up to you to believe it or not. After all, without the Mustard Fruit, Chick will probably need hundreds of years to advance to the Terror grade. And this is under the circumstances of being sufficiently lucky. If you have the patience, keep waiting.” With that mentioned, the antelope released its hoof that was pressing down on Chick.</p>
<p>Chick wanted to fly towards the Mustard Fruit, but Zhou Wen called it back.</p>
<p>From Chick’s reaction, although what the antelope said might not be true, there was no doubt that Chick wanted the Mustard Fruit.</p>
<p>“How can I pluck the Mustard Fruit? Furthermore, even if I pluck it, as you said, if there are really three thousand worlds inside, how can Chick consume it?” Zhou Wen asked the antelope.</p>
<p>“You’ll need to think of a way to pluck it, but you don’t have to worry about the consumption. Three Mustard Fruits only represent three thousand worlds, not real ones. As long as you can pluck them, that will cut off their energy supply and the spatial powers will naturally converge. When the time comes, they will only be three fruits. How difficult would it be for Chick to eat them?” The antelope had clearly thought it through.</p>
<p>Even if it’s not the real three thousand worlds, the spatial powers of the Mustard Fruits are too terrifying. It won’t be easy to pluck them. Zhou Wen thought about how he could pluck the Mustard Fruits.</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t have had the chance if it was easy. They would have long been plucked clean by the Devas.” The antelope wrote.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and managed to come up with a solution. Therefore, Zhou Wen said, “There’s a solution, but I don’t know if it will work. Let’s give it a try.”</p>
<p>With that said, Zhou Wen plucked a mountain rock from the ground beside him. He weighed it in his hand before throwing it at a Mustard Fruit.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was naturally using the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art. As long as the stone touched the Mustard Fruit, he could swap them.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if this method was effective against spatial-type Mustard Fruits.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1197'>Chapter 1197: Mustard Fruits</h3>
<p>The stone quickly flew close to a fruit. Just as it was about to approach the fruit, it suddenly vanished, similar to when Zhou Wen used teleportation.</p>
<p>The antelope didn’t lie to me this time. The Mustard Fruit is indeed spatial in nature. There’s a huge space inside. The mark Zhou Wen left on the stone still existed. He could sense that the stone had been teleported to a special space.</p>
<p>I wonder if it will work! Zhou Wen could still sense the spatial label on the stone. He planned on trying the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping technique, but he didn’t know if he could succeed under the present circumstances. After all, the stone had been sent into another space. It was difficult to say if the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art would work.</p>
<p>Clown Mask that represented the Godfiend Era and the Singularity Universe that represented the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art circulated at the same time, producing a strange resonance. Zhou Wen sensed the spatial label on the stone and used the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping technique.</p>
<p>This technique combined two spatial Terror powers. The instant he used it, Zhou Wen found the fruit undergoing a strange change.</p>
<p>The Mustard Fruit that was originally growing on the tree branch, suddenly turned into a fist-sized stone. In the next second, the stone shattered and the Mustard Fruit dropped.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was overjoyed—he had succeeded. He had exchanged the Mustard Fruit with the stone in the Mustard Space. As there was no space in the stone, the Mustard Fruit naturally dropped.</p>
<p>However, the Mustard Fruit had already left the Mustard Tree. Without an energy supply, the spatial powers within the Mustard Fruit clearly became weaker.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could catch the Mustard Fruit, Chick rushed out excitedly. Like a golden bolt of lightning, it swallowed the Mustard Fruit in midair.</p>
<p>After Chick swallowed the Mustard Fruit, it suddenly vanished. However, it immediately appeared in another place before disappearing again. It was elsewhere when it appeared again.</p>
<p>Chick seemed to constantly teleport as its figure blinked in and out of existence. It took a while before it gradually stabilized.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Chick slowly return to normal. He picked up another stone and used Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping to get another Mustard Fruit.</p>
<p>Chick was very greedy as it flew over and swallowed the second Mustard Fruit. This time, its figure shimmered even more as it constantly vanished and appeared in different spots.</p>
<p>It lasted longer this time. Chick didn’t completely return to normal. Even if it stood there motionless, its figure would suddenly vanish before suddenly appearing again.</p>
<p>“Oh no, a terrifying fellow is coming. Quickly pluck the third fruit.” The antelope suddenly made a sound and didn’t write on the ground. Its expression turned extremely solemn.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also felt that something was amiss. He saw dark clouds billowing over the mountain, instantly darkening the world as though it was doomsday.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, a beam of light tore through the dark clouds. It illuminated the area where Zhou Wen and company were.</p>
<p>The light was too fast. Before Zhou Wen could pluck the third fruit, the light had already scattered, brightly illuminating the area.</p>
<p>“Paradise Domain… F*ck you… I’m not done with life… I don’t want to go to the Western Paradise…” The antelope cried out as a third vertical eye at its glabella suddenly opened. Its entire body emitted a crackling sound.</p>
<p>Originally, the antelope was thin and weak, making it look like a malnourished antelope, but at that instant, its body became as strong as a bull. The horns on its head were snow-white and crystalline like curved blades. A sanguine glow spewed out from its vertical eye, turning into a blood-colored barrier that enveloped the nearby area.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The brilliance collided with the sanguine barrier. The latter quaked and abruptly shrank. However, it ultimately resisted the terrifying beam and prevented it from descending.</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhou Wen had already used Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping to remove the last Mustard Fruit.</p>
<p>However, Chick was still constantly shuttling through space. It couldn’t control its body. It tried flying towards the third fruit, but as it flew, it involuntarily entered a spatial teleportation state. When it appeared again, it was somewhere else.</p>
<p>After several attempts, Chick failed to approach the falling Mustard Fruit.</p>
<p>“What are you waiting for? Quickly take the fruit and run. When that fellow comes down, we will all be doomed,” the antelope cried out.</p>
<p>Blood tears were already flowing out of its vertical eye. The eye looked like it was about to crack open. The sanguine barrier quaked as it shrank, as though it would shatter at any moment.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen teleported over and grabbed the falling Mustard Fruit. Then, he went over to grab Chick, hoping to take it away.</p>
<p>However, just as he grabbed Chick, Chick’s body automatically tore through space and vanished from Zhou Wen’s hand, appearing elsewhere.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized things were going south. Chick’s situation was too unstable, so it was impossible for him to grab it and escape. He made a prompt decision and took out the Chaos Bead.</p>
<p>When Chick phased into existence again, Zhou Wen stuffed it into the Chaos Bead’s space and stuffed the remaining Mustard Fruit inside.</p>
<p>After confirming that Chick hadn’t tunneled out of it, Zhou Wen fled down the mountain at full speed.</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhou Wen had succeeded, the antelope turned around and ran. It ran much faster than him and overtook him in moments.</p>
<p>Rumble!</p>
<p>However, the brilliance kept targeting the antelope. Furthermore, it became more and more resplendent. It blasted the antelope’s sanguine barrier. It kept crackling and fractures appeared. The brilliance was seeping in.</p>
<p>Struck by such a heavy blow, blood spewed out of the antelope’s vertical eye. Its eyeball was about to burst.</p>
<p>“F*ck you. Do you really think I have nothing?” The antelope cursed and suddenly opened its mouth to spit something out. At the same time, it shouted, “Supreme Venerable Sovereign, be quick, as if this were a command! Seal…”</p>
<p>Upon saying the sutra, the antelope spat out another mouthful of blood on the thing it had spat out previously.</p>
<p>It was a yellow paper talisman. After the blood spewed out, the yellow paper talisman emitted a sanguine glow. A blood-colored Dao talisman lit up like a lamp.</p>
<p>The yellow paper talisman flew to the sanguine barrier and stuck to it like a seal. The sanguine barrier that was about to shatter stabilized and wasn’t shattered by the brilliance.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still reeling in astonishment at the might of the yellow paper talisman when the antelope suddenly rushed over. With a flick of its horn, it sent Zhou Wen and Ya’er flying. It leaped into the air and let Zhou Wen and Ya’er land on its back.</p>
<p>In the next instant, it galloped forward without any regard for its life. Its speed was so fast that even Zhou Wen felt the scenery on both sides rapidly sweep backward, turning extremely blurry.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>An apocalyptic beam descended and struck the sanguine barrier. Even with the power of the yellow paper talisman, the sanguine barrier shattered as a terrifying beam of brilliance fell.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1198'>Chapter 1198: Asura Realm</h3>
<p>“Pui! Pui! Pui!” The antelope shouted as it spat out three mouthfuls of blood. The three mouthfuls of blood bloomed into three blood flowers that rose up and shielded their heads.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The terrifying brilliance collided with the three blood flowers, producing a terrifying shockwave that sent the antelope, Zhou Wen, and company flying.</p>
<p>The antelope’s majestic body was already covered in blood patterns as its vertical eye surged with blood.</p>
<p>It transformed into a sanguine beam in midair and carried Zhou Wen and Ya’er out of Mount Meru, heading straight for the exit of the Deva Realm.</p>
<p>Only then did the three blood flowers shatter. The brilliance continued chasing after the antelope and company, and just as it was about to catch up, the antelope had already rushed to the entrance of the Deva Realm and leaped out.</p>
<p>However, the brilliance couldn’t leave the Deva Realm; it couldn’t chase after them.</p>
<p>The antelope landed on the ground and its forelimbs went limp as it collapsed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen landed on the ground and hurriedly turned to look at the antelope. He saw that it had already gotten up. The vertical eye on its forehead had vanished, but there was a bloody mark between its brows. Its body had returned to its normal antelope form.</p>
<p>Even so, its body was still stained with blood, and blood was still seeping from the corner of its mouth.</p>
<p>After spitting out a mouthful of blood, the antelope cursed, “That bastard on Mount Meru made me lose a bet. When I recover, I’ll definitely storm my way up Mount Meru and capture those turtles and let some blood spill.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the antelope in shock. Its appearance overturned his former impression of it.</p>
<p>This fellow used to be lazy and ignored anyone while sprawled on the sofa. Furthermore, it didn’t speak at all. Occasionally, he would write a few words with its hooves, looking aloof.</p>
<p>But now, the antelope was like a hooligan. It kept spewing out vulgarities.</p>
<p>“Um, do you need me to treat you?” Zhou Wen asked as he looked at the antelope’s body.</p>
<p>“Even Mount Laojun’s Nine Revolutions Golden Pill can’t treat my injuries. Can you treat it?” The antelope was clearly in a bad mood. It glared at Zhou Wen and spat in the direction of the Deva Realm’s door. “Pui.”</p>
<p>“You mentioned a bet. What bet was it?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>The antelope rolled its eyes unhappily. “It’s none of your business. Stay out of it.”</p>
<p>After a pause, the antelope asked, “How’s Chick? Did it eat the third Mustard Fruit?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked inside the Chaos Bead. He also wanted to know how Chick was.</p>
<p>However, his expression immediately changed from the scene he saw. He scanned the Chaos Bead several times, but he didn’t find Chick.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, Chick is missing. Don’t tell me it’s still in the Deva Realm?” Zhou Wen was immediately alarmed.</p>
<p>The antelope was very calm and after some thought it asked, “Is the third Mustard Fruit still there?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he somewhat understood the antelope’s intentions. He hurriedly looked into the Chaos Bead and realized that the Mustard Fruit was indeed gone.</p>
<p>“The Mustard Fruit is gone,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Then it’s fine. After some time, Chick will naturally complete its evolution and return… Ugh…” As the antelope spoke, it suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood. Its body staggered and it nearly fell. It looked like it had suffered serious injuries.</p>
<p>“I have a Dragon Tiger Pill Essence here. It has a resurrective effect. Take a look and see if it’s of any use.” Seeing that the antelope’s situation was terrible, Zhou Wen summoned the Mythical Dragon Tiger Pill Essence.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for the antelope going all out, they probably wouldn’t have made it out alive. Although the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence was rare, there was still a chance of it dropping in the future. In such a dangerous place, having the antelope with such combat strength was far more useful than a pill essence.</p>
<p>“That low-grade item is useless to me. Keep it for yourself.” The antelope glanced at the door of the Asura Realm and continued, “The person you are looking for is probably in the Asura Realm. If you want to go, be careful. I’m injured, so I won’t join you in the fun.”</p>
<p>The antelope was straightforward. With that said, it turned around and walked towards the Bridge of Helplessness to leave the strange six realms of rebirth and existence.</p>
<p>As it walked, it cursed. “What a huge loss. Sooner or later, I’ll skin those b*stards and hang them on a flagpole and use them as lanterns…”</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen watched the antelope walk onto the Bridge of Helplessness, a thought suddenly flashed across his mind. Could it be that this fellow’s bet was to not speak?</p>
<p>Without any time to think, Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and turned to walk towards the door of Asura Realm. Since Ouyang Lan and company weren’t in Deva Realm, the most likely possibility was the Asura Realm.</p>
<p>The Asura Realm was fiendish, so it wasn’t safer than the Deva Realm. It might even be more dangerous.</p>
<p>Since there were Calamity-grade existences in the Deva Realm, it was definitely the same for the Asura Realm. Zhou Wen only hoped that An Sheng and company were fine.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Zhou Wen walked into the Asura Realm.</p>
<p>The moment he entered, Zhou Wen was immediately given a fright. He saw a cold saber cleave down, almost hitting his face.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen was prepared. The Asura Saber in his hand blocked the saber in front of him.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The Asura Saber was transformed from Deva Asura. How could an ordinary weapon compare to a Terror-grade weapon? When the blade touched the Asura Saber, it immediately snapped into two.</p>
<p>The Asura Saber didn’t stop there as it split the saber-wielding figure into two.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen identify the creature slashing at him—a humanoid creature wearing a ghoul mask. It bared its muscular upper body and revealed a strange bird tattoo on its back.</p>
<p>The strange bird symbol occupied almost all of his entire back and left shoulder. It looked like a peacock, but it was blood-red.</p>
<p>As for his lower body, he was wearing a black feathered piece of clothing that resembled a skirt and pants. It was difficult to tell what it was.</p>
<p>“Kill!” A tsunami-like battle cry sounded, causing Zhou Wen’s eardrums to buzz.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, there were creatures everywhere on the dilapidated land that resembled an ancient battlefield. They held long sabers and their eyes were filled with killing intent as they swept toward Zhou Wen like a tidal wave.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen brandished the Asura Saber and instantly killed countless nearby creatures, but the other creatures continued charging forward fearlessly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen slew the aggressors as he advanced, hoping to find An Sheng and company. However, before long, he discovered a problem.</p>
<p>The creatures he had killed came to life again. Even if their bodies were diced up, they could automatically reconnect. In the blink of an eye, they were no longer injured as they continued their charge.</p>
<p>Strange? The Deva Asura is a Terror-grade saber. It can slay even Mythical, much less these creatures who don’t even have combat strength at the Mythical stage. Yet, they are completely fine. Something’s amiss. Zhou Wen realized the problem as he rushed forward.</p>
<p>An Sheng and company would probably be in trouble if they were entangled by these undying and indestructible monsters. Zhou Wen’s number one desire was to find them quickly.</p>
<p>With his previous experience, Zhou Wen didn’t teleport. All he did was constantly charge across the land. With the Asura Saber in hand, the tidal-like creatures couldn’t stop him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1199'>Chapter 1199: Saint</h3>
<p>When An Sheng and An Tianzuo entered the Asura Realm, their encounter was identical to Zhou Wen’s. Under such circumstances, it was impossible for them to wait for Zhou Wen to enter and move together. All they could do was charge in.</p>
<p>An Sheng suspected that Ouyang Lan and company had entered the Asura Realm. It was so dangerous here that even if Ouyang Lan and company had really entered, they might have retreated.</p>
<p>After all, such a battlefield was too dangerous. There were Asuras everywhere, giving one no time to rest.</p>
<p>However, An Tianzuo seemed to be certain that Ouyang Lan had taken this path. He kept rushing deeper into the Asura Realm.</p>
<p>Wearing his armor, An Tianzuo was a Terror-grade existence. He held a Gatling firearm in his hand as he crazily swept at the ghoul-like Asuras. Wherever he passed, large swaths of Asuras fell, their bodies peppered with holes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Asuras stood up again shortly after. Their bodies returned to their original states as they lunged forward again.</p>
<p>Among the Asuras, there was no lack of Mythical existences, but when faced with An Tianzuo’s firepower, their bodies exploded before they could even charge forward. Occasionally, one or two would slip to the cracks, but they were killed by An Sheng.</p>
<p>The two of them charged forward and after an unknown distance, they saw a strange altar in front of them.</p>
<p>The altar was made of twelve black stone pillars, and on the stone pillar in the middle stood a flag.</p>
<p>The flag fluttered in the wind, and there was an anchor symbol drawn on it.</p>
<p>However, An Tianzuo and An Sheng didn’t look at the flag. Their eyes were focused on the stone pillars.</p>
<p>A few people were tied to the different stone pillars. On one of the stone pillars was Ouyang Lan. The people on the other stone pillars were the Sunset Army generals who had followed Ouyang Lan to Netherworld City.</p>
<p>They were chained to the stone pillars. All of them were on their last breaths and most of them had already fainted.</p>
<p>When he saw the whip marks on Ouyang Lan and company and their ripped clothes with blood seeping out of the cracks, An Tianzuo’s eyes instantly turned cold.</p>
<p>Gatling flames spewed out as the firepower seemed to become even more violent. It blasted the horde of Asuras ahead, turning them into sieves. Even existences as powerful as Mythical creatures were as weak as paper in the storm of bullets.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo flew up and wanted to rush up the altar to save Ouyang Lan and company.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a cold beam of light appeared and shot towards An Tianzuo’s chest like a phantom. The cold beam was too fast and reached his heart in the blink of an eye. An Tianzuo didn’t have the time to adjust the Gatling gun’s muzzle.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The broadsword in An Tianzuo’s other hand struck the cold beam like a ghost.</p>
<p>Sparks flew, revealing the cold beam’s true face—an arrow. As the tip of the arrow collided with the hilt, sparks flew everywhere. An Tianzuo uncontrollably took a step back as the arrow deviated from its trajectory and hit the ground beside him.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A huge crater was blasted into the ground, but the arrow vanished.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo frowned as he looked in the direction of the altar. He saw a person wearing purple armor and a ghoul mask standing on a stone pillar.</p>
<p>He held a hunting bow in his left hand with his other palm open. The arrow that vanished appeared in his palm and was gently pinched by his fingers.</p>
<p>“You’re finally here? I’ve been waiting for you for a long time,” the person said indifferently as he looked at An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” An Tianzuo asked slowly as he stared at the person.</p>
<p>The person had the aura of a Guardian, but there was no inkling of a human aura. It was unknown if there was a human inside the armor.</p>
<p>“Saint… Xiao…” the person said calmly.</p>
<p>“You were waiting for me?” An Tianzuo didn’t immediately rush towards the altar but asked coldly.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Xiao nodded slightly.</p>
<p>“You forced them here to lure me here?” An Tianzuo continued asking.</p>
<p>Xiao nodded before shaking his head. “Partially. You need to die; likewise for them.”</p>
<p>“Why?” An Tianzuo wasn’t outraged as he continued asking.</p>
<p>Xiao didn’t answer, but he suddenly laughed. “People say that one should give birth to a child like An Tianzuo. From what I see today, you’re nothing much. Your mother is hung here by me, her fate unknown, but you still have the mood to chat with me.”</p>
<p>An Tianzuo’s expression didn’t change as he looked at Xiao and said, “Since you aren’t willing to tell me, let me guess.”</p>
<p>“Oh, please be my guest.” Xiao looked at An Tianzuo with interest.</p>
<p>“You want to kill us because we investigated the expedition team.” An Tianzuo’s tone wasn’t a question, but an affirmative description.</p>
<p>“Is that all?” Xiao didn’t deny it. It wasn’t difficult to guess this conclusion.</p>
<p>“You come from the Holy Land,” An Tianzuo continued.</p>
<p>“Not bad.” Xiao nodded in acknowledgment. He looked at An Tianzuo with a smile and said, “From the word ‘Saint’ I just mentioned, you can confirm that I’m from the Holy Land. This isn’t difficult to guess.”</p>
<p>“You come from the Trajectory Holy Temple,” An Tianzuo said again, unmoved.</p>
<p>Xiao was somewhat surprised as he looked at An Tianzuo and asked, “How did you know that I came from the Trajectory Holy Temple?”</p>
<p>“It’s not difficult to guess. Figure it out yourself,” An Tianzuo said indifferently.</p>
<p>Xiao laughed. “You are indeed an interesting person. I can’t bear to kill you. Unfortunately, you have to die here today. An Tianzuo will no longer exist in this world.”</p>
<p>With that said, Xiao raised the hunting bow in his hand and nocked the arrow. However, he wasn’t aiming at An Tianzuo, but Ouyang Lan on the stone pillar.</p>
<p>“It’s best if you don’t move. You should know that with my arrow speed, I can kill her before you arrive. If you want her to live for now, break an arm. Then, I can give you a chance to fight me,” Xiao said.</p>
<p>“You’ve already lost. You don’t have the confidence to defeat me,” An Tianzuo said as he looked at Xiao.</p>
<p>Xiao said indifferently, “I just don’t like trouble.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?” An Tianzuo’s hand that was holding the sword suddenly moved. He slashed at his right arm and severed the arm that was holding the Gatling.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The Gatling along with the arm fell to the ground together, blood flowing everywhere.</p>
<p>“Overseer!” An Sheng was alarmed and furious.</p>
<p>“Do you still want my left arm? I can give it to you as well,” An Tianzuo stopped An Sheng and said coldly.</p>
<p>Xiao’s eyes narrowed slightly as he slowly moved the bow in his hand away from Ouyang Lan and slowly aimed it at An Tianzuo. He said coldly, “An Tianzuo, Overseer An, Luoyang’s God of War. You have the right to be arrogant, but you chose the wrong time and place to be arrogant. You even chose the wrong person.”</p>
<p>“Many people have said such words to me, but they are all dead,” An Tianzuo said indifferently.</p>
