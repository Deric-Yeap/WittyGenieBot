<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“Is that so?” Xiao pointed his bow and arrow at An Tianzuo. The tip of the arrow gradually lit up like a light bulb. As time passed, the light on the tip of the arrow became brighter and more intense, like a sun.</p>
<p>“Sun True Body, Sun Strafe Art?” An Tianzuo was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>The Sun True Body was nothing; one had a chance of obtaining it as long as one went to the Sun God Holy Temple. However, according to what he knew, An Jing was the only one who knew the Sun Strafe Art. He originally imagined that Zhou Wen had also practiced it, but he later realized that Zhou Wen wasn’t practicing the Sun Strafe Art.</p>
<p>The crux of the matter was that the Sun Strafe Art was essentially exclusive to the An family. It didn’t seem like it should be passed on to outsiders.</p>
<p>At the instant An Tianzuo fell into a daze, the arrow shot out. It was like the descent of a heavenly sun as it charged at An Tianzuo with an extremely blazing power.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo only had one arm left as he held the broadsword. His eyes were firm and determined as he raised the sword and slashed at the sun.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The sun-like dazzling light was sliced apart by the broadsword. The blade collided with the tip of the arrow, and the terrifying light exploded like a hydrogen bomb.</p>
<p>The surrounding Asuras were instantly annihilated as An Sheng was sent flying by the shockwave.</p>
<p>Thankfully, although An Sheng hadn’t reached the Terror grade, his skills and Companion Beasts were very good. He managed to leverage himself in the air as he traveled through it, all the while reducing the impact on his body.</p>
<p>After the light faded, An Tianzuo stood in his spot with the broadsword in hand. A large area around him had turned into a deep pit as the wrecked Asuras squirmed and recovered.</p>
<p>“Where did you learn the Sun Strafe Art?” An Tianzuo asked as he stared at Xiao.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you good at guessing? Guess,” Xiao teased.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo clearly wasn’t a person who liked to waste his breath. He slashed his broadsword at Xiao.</p>
<p>Xiao stood motionlessly on the stone pillar until the broadsword was in front of him. Just as it was about to touch his hair, his body seemed to warp. Not only did he not retreat, but he charged at An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>As space distorted, the broadsword seemed to automatically avoid him as it brushed past him. Instead, Xiao used the hunting bow’s bowstring as a blade to slash at An Tianzuo’s neck.</p>
<p>The broadsword was clumsy to begin with, and the two of them were too close. An Tianzuo had lost an arm, so he had no time to block.</p>
<p>Everyone believed that An Tianzuo would dodge, but he didn’t. At the instant the bowstring approached, he opened his mouth and bit the bowstring with his teeth, snapping it instantly.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time he snapped the bowstring, An Tianzuo slashed horizontally at Xiao.</p>
<p>Xiao did a twist and drew an arc. It didn’t seem fast, but he dodged the sword’s attack. The sword’s trajectory seemed to be distorted. It should have been able to hit Xiao’s blade, but it slashed past him.</p>
<p>“The Dugu family’s movement technique,” An Tianzuo said as he slashed at Xiao again without stopping.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that I came from the Trajectory Holy Temple? What’s so strange about me knowing the Dugu family’s movement techniques?” Xiao’s figure moved erratically as he dodged An Tianzuo’s repeated attacks.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo knew that the truth wasn’t as Xiao said.</p>
<p>The Dugu family’s movement technique was indeed from the Trajectory Holy Temple, but what the Trajectory Holy Temple had given them was only the tricks to the Trajectory movement technique. The Dugu family’s present achievements were due to their continuous research on the Trajectory movement technique.</p>
<p>The Dugu family’s Trajectory movement technique had already been imprinted with their own unique trademarks.</p>
<p>Even if he had learned the Trajectory movement technique from the Trajectory Holy Temple, it would be impossible for it to be identical to the Dugu family’s.</p>
<p>However, Xiao’s Trajectory movement technique clearly had the inklings of the Dugu family’s. It wasn’t purely the Trajectory movement technique.</p>
<p>“Your sword art isn’t as arrogant as you.” Xiao dodged a few strikes before finally counterattacking.</p>
<p>As he dodged the broadsword, frost appeared on the bow that had its string snapped. It swept at An Tianzuo like an ice popsicle.</p>
<p>“The frost battle aura of the Ultimate Family Clan?” An Tianzuo’s broadsword clashed with the bow. A cold aura immediately spread from the broadsword, forming frost on half the blade.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo blasted the bow away, but Xiao used the bow like a staff in an extremely strange manner. An Tianzuo’s broadsword had no choice but to constantly clash with the bow.</p>
<p>Every time they clashed, the frost battle aura on the bow was transmitted into the broadsword, and traveled through the broadsword up to An Tianzuo’s hand. His sword-wielding arm was already covered in frost that was spreading towards his body.</p>
<p>“Now, are you still sure that I’m from the Trajectory Holy Temple?” Xiao said as he attacked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” An Tianzuo answered very calmly, but his tone was very certain.</p>
<p>He brandished his sword and sent Xiao retreating. The frost on his body instantly shattered and splattered everywhere. Ice shards fell to the ground, but An Tianzuo’s body wasn’t affected by the freezing.</p>
<p>“You are actually immune to the freezing forces of the frost battle aura. You shouldn’t have revealed it so early. If you had waited a little longer and suddenly attacked when I was close, you would have been able to cause me some trouble,” Xiao said as he retreated.</p>
<p>“There’s no need.” An Tianzuo struck again and again.</p>
<p>His sword art was domineering and orthodox. Ordinary people would have some evil aura when their sword art was so domineering.</p>
<p>It was just like how Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal was domineering. But, despite being domineering, An Tianzuo’s sword art gave off an upright feeling. It was truly odd.</p>
<p>Xiao’s movement technique was ever-changing, and his moves were varied. It appeared as though he could freely use the famous techniques of the six families as if he had practiced them since he was young.</p>
<p>Even An Tianzuo was alarmed.</p>
<p>He knew that this was definitely not an mime ability, but something he had truly cultivated with great effort. He could sense that something was different.</p>
<p>Who is this fellow? An Tianzuo was momentarily unable to gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>An Sheng hadn’t reached the Terror grade yet. Although his talent was special and he could vaguely see some shadows—blurry ones. It wasn’t much different from not being able to see them. He only roughly knew where they were fighting.</p>
<p>Gritting his teeth, An Sheng avoided the area where they were fighting and rushed towards the altar, hoping to save Ouyang Lan and company.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>An Sheng wanted to rush up the altar. There was clearly no obstruction, but when he rushed over, it was as though he had slammed into a wall. He bounced back, his face swollen and his nose bleeding.</p>
<p>An Sheng summoned his Companion Beast and transformed it into a dagger that stabbed into the air. There was only a clang, and the hand holding the dagger went numb—the dagger failed to break through.</p>
<p>He tried various methods to break through the invisible barrier, but none of them worked.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, An Tianzuo and Xiao were fighting evenly. Neither of them had the absolute upper hand.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo’s figure suddenly froze as he pointed the broadsword at Xiao. Instantly, the entire world seemed to vanish, leaving only the broadsword in the world.</p>
<p>Xiao was wearing a mask. It was unknown what expression he had, but his body stopped moving as he stared intently at An Tianzuo. The purple armor on his body emitted a golden glow as the Light of Terror above his head condensed into a crown.</p>
<p>“Holy Emperor Body?” An Tianzuo recognized what it was and couldn’t help but frown slightly.</p>
<p>The Holy Emperor Body originated from the Divine Emperor Holy Temple. It had always been the heritage of the Cape family.</p>
<p>“Your Terror powers are similar to nomological powers. They can destroy all evil, but this power of imperial authority should be your nemesis, right?” Xiao looked down at An Tianzuo like a supreme god emperor.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1201'>Chapter 1201: Inside the Altar</h3>
<p>The broadsword that originally occupied the world seemed to become tiny in an instant. Instead, when Xiao’s hand slammed down, the sword beam immediately disintegrated in a rapid collapse.</p>
<p>The broadsword in An Tianzuo’s hand hummed as though it would snap at any moment.</p>
<p>Under the immense pressure, every step Xiao took made An Tianzuo take a step back. The broadsword’s blade began to bend under the pressure.</p>
<p>“In front of the imperial authority, the law is just a toy. Your nomological sword can’t defeat imperial authority, so you can’t win against me either.” Xiao constantly oppressed An Tianzuo while verbally disturbing his will.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo didn’t say a word as he drilled his feet into the rocks like nails. He didn’t retreat any further as the broadsword in his hand forcefully resisted the power of Xiao’s imperial authority. It bent further and further under the pressure. The broadsword seemed to turn into bamboo as it bent to a ninety-degree angle.</p>
<p>“An Tianzuo, you lost because you were too confident and arrogant. If you had both your hands, I might not have been able to clinch victory so easily. Unfortunately, you are too weak with only one hand.” As Xiao spoke, the divine imperial authority from his body completely erupted. He threw a punch and the golden light snapped the broadsword, drowning An Tianzuo in a brilliant golden light.</p>
<p>However, at that moment, Xiao’s expression suddenly changed drastically. He circulated his Trajectory movement technique and quickly retreated, but it was too late.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The glorious golden imperial authority shattered. An Tianzuo instantly appeared in front of Xiao with the snapped sword, stabbing at his heart.</p>
<p>Xiao’s trajectory movement technique changed strangely. Just as he thought he could escape the snapped sword’s attack, it suddenly flew out from An Tianzuo’s hand and penetrated his heart.</p>
<p>The force from the broadsword didn’t stop as it slammed into the stone pillar behind him, pinning him to it.</p>
<p>Xiao reached out to pull out the broken sword, but when his fingers touched it, they were immediately repelled by the power of the broken sword as though they had been electrocuted. At the same time, the broken sword was nailed deeper.</p>
<p>“So what if it’s imperial authority? In my eyes, there’s only right and wrong, nothing else. Ignoring the fact that there aren’t any emperors in this era, even if there are, they still have to accept the punishment of the law.” As An Tianzuo spoke, he rushed towards the altar to rescue Ouyang Lan and company.</p>
<p>Xiao, who was nailed to the stone pillar, suddenly cackled crazily. He grabbed the broken sword at his chest with both hands and allowed its nomological power to slice through his body, but he remained unperturbed.</p>
<p>His armor and flesh were lacerated by the nomological power, but he managed to pull the broken sword out of his chest.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Xiao threw the broken sword to the ground. His almost shattered heart and the wounds on his body were rapidly healing at an unbelievable speed. In the blink of an eye, he had completely recovered.</p>
<p>“Invincible Connate Divine Art?” An Tianzuo frowned as he looked at Xiao. He recognized the power.</p>
<p>Floating in the air, Xiao stopped laughing and said coldly, “Your so-called law is just a product of the strong’s circlejerk. Only by being strong enough can you set the law and ignore imperial authority. If you aren’t strong enough, talking about the law and sanctions is just a joke. If you, An Tianzuo, say that there are laws, there can be laws. That’s because you are strong enough, but what’s the difference between that and imperial authority? It’s just a difference in name. An Tianzuo, your nomological sword is ultimately a sword of authority. Why are you fooling yourself?”</p>
<p>At their level, battle was no longer a battle of pure technique. It was a battle of faith.</p>
<p>If a person knew that he was in the wrong, he could fight with all his might without any distractions. But even a momentary lapse in concentration could become a fatal flaw.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if one believed that they were in the right, their beliefs unbreakable, they could deliver 120% of their original strength.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo remained unmoved as he extended his hand and beckoned. The broken sword automatically flew back into his palm. An Tianzuo held the broken sword and said, “It doesn’t matter. I’ve never believed in equality for everyone. My methods are for the law, and only for the law.”</p>
<p>With that said, An Tianzuo walked towards Xiao step by step. The broken sword in his hand produced the nomological law that constantly condensed on it like a chain. It mended the damaged sword body and made its power stronger.</p>
<p>Xiao held the broken bow. His Terror power was strange and unpredictable. He had used many powers, so it was difficult to tell which power he had.</p>
<p>At the instant An Tianzuo raised his sword, Xiao took a step forward. With this step, the entire world seemed to press down on An Tianzuo. This wasn’t the Dugu family’s Trajectory movement technique, but the Xia family’s Path to Snatching Heaven.</p>
<p>No matter how Xiao’s movement technique and strength changed, the broken sword in An Tianzuo’s hand remained the same. It didn’t have many tricks or various magical abilities, but all opposing might was destroyed by his sword force. No matter how Xiao transformed, he couldn’t gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>“Xiao, there’s no time for you to continue playing.” A voice sounded from the altar as a figure walked out from behind a stone pillar with a flag planted.</p>
<p>The person was dressed very similarly to Xiao. He was also wearing armor and a mask, but his figure was even taller and brawnier. He was nearly three meters tall and no longer looked like a normal human.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo and An Sheng’s hearts tightened. What they were most worried about had happened.</p>
<p>The other party had spent so much effort to lure them here. There was no reason for Xiao to be alone.</p>
<p>In fact, it was true. The man walked out from behind the stone pillar and slowly walked to the stone pillar where Ouyang Lan was. He glanced at the nearly unconscious Ouyang Lan who was chained to the stone pillar.</p>
<p>“It’s none of your business,” Xiao said.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to interfere either, but they have to die,” the man said as he raised his fist. His fist emitted a sun-like glow as it blasted at Ouyang Lan with scorching power.</p>
<p>“Stop…” An Sheng slammed into the altar with all his might. He wasn’t strong enough to break through the altar’s barrier as it only resulted in him fracturing his bones. Blood seeped out of his mouth and nose.</p>
<p>Knowing that it was impossible to rush in, An Sheng gritted his teeth as his eyes emitted a demonic glow. It was as though numbers were flowing in his pupils.</p>
<p>Inside the altar, the man’s arm seemed to be bound by an invisible rope. He paused slightly and turned to look at An Sheng.</p>
<p>An Sheng bled from his seven orifices as the strange light in his eyes intensified.</p>
<p>“Annoying worm.” The man turned his arm and threw a punch at An Sheng.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>An Sheng didn’t have the time to dodge. As his body was drowned by the sun-like punch, a huge crater was blasted open in the ground.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1202'>Chapter 1202: Supreme Yin Cracks Supreme Yang</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>The armor on An Sheng’s body shattered as his body was severely burned. His flesh was almost charred as he collapsed into the huge crater, smoking. It was difficult to tell if he was dead or alive.</p>
<p>The man turned around and was about to attack Ouyang Lan again when he realized that the force had wrapped around his arm again. He turned his head and saw An Sheng struggling to get up from the ground. His injuries were so serious that it was difficult for him to even stand up, but the demonic glint in his eyes didn’t weaken.</p>
<p>“What a disgusting worm. It’s as nauseating as a cockroach.” The man glanced at An Sheng in disgust. The power of Supreme Yang over his fist became stronger and stronger, and soon, it was so intense that one couldn’t look straight at it.</p>
<p>Even outside the altar, one could sense the terrifying heat from his fist. Clearly, the man wasn’t interested in wasting time with An Sheng and wanted to finish him off in one strike.</p>
<p>This time, the power of the Supreme Yang over his fist was more than a hundred times stronger than before. It was power at the Terror grade, unlike the casual strike from before.</p>
<p>An evil glint flashed in the man’s eyes. He didn’t turn his fist towards An Sheng but continued aiming at Ouyang Lan.</p>
<p>If An Sheng gave up now, his fist would blast at Ouyang Lan. If he didn’t give up, he wouldn’t even have a chance of escaping—he would be killed.</p>
<p>An Sheng had already seen through the man’s plan, but he had no other choice. He stood in the crater with great difficulty as the numbers in his eyes constantly streamed, transforming into a strange force that wrapped around the man’s arm, preventing him from attacking Ouyang Lan.</p>
<p>An Sheng knew very well that his strength wasn’t enough to restrain the man. The reason the man didn’t attack Ouyang Lan directly was to deliberately put him in a dilemma and watch him suffer mental torment.</p>
<p>An Sheng wasn’t outraged; instead, he felt lucky because his strength wasn’t enough to really stop the man and he couldn’t rush into the altar. The man’s actions allowed him to stall for time.</p>
<p>“Your time is up.” Seeing that An Sheng was unmoved, the man lost his interest in continuing the game. The terrifying sun-like punch blasted at An Sheng. The entire world seemed to be drowned by the incandescent punch. Even the air seemed to melt.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo wanted to rush over a few times, but he was held back by Xiao. Unable to help, he shouted at An Sheng, “Ah Sheng, leave!”</p>
<p>“Overseer, I hope that I can still be your adjutant in my next life.” An Sheng faced the sun-like punch calmly. He no longer had the chance to leave, nor did he want to.</p>
<p>The terrifying light and heat melted everything. Just as An Sheng’s figure was about to be overwhelmed by it, a breeze suddenly blew over.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>When the terrifying flames encountered the breeze, not only did they fail to intensify, but they were instantly extinguished. In an instant, the sun-like punch silently extinguished. Wherever the breeze blew, frost formed on the ground.</p>
<p>A girl who was as graceful as a fairy flew to An Sheng’s side on a banana leaf.</p>
<p>When An Sheng saw the girl, he was immediately overjoyed. He turned his head and saw Zhou Wen carrying Ya’er over. “Young Master Wen, you’re finally here. What took you so long?”</p>
<p>Upon seeing Zhou Wen, An Tianzuo’s expression eased as he stared intently at Xiao.</p>
<p>“It’s not bad that I managed to arrive alive.” Zhou Wen came in front of the altar and looked at the man on it.</p>
<p>The man sized up Zhou Wen and Banana Fairy and asked coldly, “You are Zhou Wen, right? You came at the right time; you saved me the trouble of making another trip.”</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Zhou Wen asked the man.</p>
<p>“Saint… Blaze…” the man answered arrogantly.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, they are from the Holy Temple. The disappearance of the expedition team is related to them,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Got it. Leave it to me.” Zhou Wen summoned some pill essences and threw them to An Sheng before walking towards the altar.</p>
<p>“You sure are confident. Are you just banking on that Terror-grade Supreme Yin Companion Beast? Her strength indeed restrains me. She might be able to stop me for a moment, but unfortunately, you can’t even enter the altar. You don’t even have the right to stop me,” Blaze said coldly as he threw a punch at Ouyang Lan and company. He didn’t want any further trouble. He wanted to kill Ouyang Lan and company immediately.</p>
<p>However, before Blaze’s fist could land, he suddenly heard a boom. The barrier outside the altar instantly shattered as a sword beam tore through the air.</p>
<p>In his horror, Blaze threw a punch at the sword beam, but his Supreme Yang punch failed to withstand it. The bones in his hand were instantly torn through. If he hadn’t ducked to the side, even his body would have been penetrated.</p>
<p>The sword beam passed through Blaze’s fist bone and circled around it before flying back to Zhou Wen’s side, transforming into a sword that floated beside him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already arrived beside Ouyang Lan. He held the sword transformed from Sword Pill and slashed thrice, severing all the chains that bound her. He reached out to catch Ouyang Lan and fed her a pill essence he summoned.</p>
<p>Ya’er and the antelope stayed by An Sheng’s side. When An Sheng saw that Ouyang Lan had been saved, he finally heaved a long sigh of relief.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Blaze looked at the Sword Pill in Zhou Wen’s hand, no longer as arrogant as before.</p>
<p>The Supreme Yang glow over Blaze’s body constantly condensed as his entire body emitted light and heat like the sun. At the same time, he said loudly, “Xiao, didn’t they say that the only Terror-grades in Luoyang are An Tianzuo and Leng Zongzheng? What’s the matter with this fellow?”</p>
<p>“How would I know? I know as much as you do,” Xiao said indifferently. “But that’s good. It’s more interesting this way. Don’t tell me you can’t even deal with an adopted son of the An family?”</p>
<p>Blaze wasn’t in the mood to waste his breath on Xiao. The Supreme Yang glow over his body became stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>“You have the power of Supreme Yang. Are you from the Sun God Temple?” Zhou Wen sized up Blaze and asked.</p>
<p>“Don’t compare me to worms like you. I’m a saint of the Sun God Holy Temple,” Blaze said coldly.</p>
<p>“In that case, you aren’t human?” Zhou Wen sized up Blaze in surprise. As the Guardian aura on Blaze’s body was intense, he couldn’t be sure if there was anyone inside the armor. However, he had a feeling that Blaze wasn’t a pure Guardian.</p>
<p>“Of course not.” Blaze constantly gathered his strength, making him look like a nuclear bomb that could explode at any moment.</p>
<p>“Were you the ones who captured Professor Ouyang and the expedition team?” Zhou Wen continued asking.</p>
<p>“Ask him in hell,” Blaze said as the power accumulated in his body instantly erupted. The terrifying power of Supreme Yang exploded like a supernova, producing a terrifying blast of light and fire.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t move as Banana Fairy spat out another mouthful of Supreme Yin Wind.</p>
<p>The power of Supreme Yang that Blaze had accumulated for a long time was blown out by the Supreme Yin Wind, as well as the flames over his body. He was swept up by the Supreme Yin Wind, and only stopped when he slammed into the stone pillar.</p>
<p>When he fell to the ground, frost had already formed over his body, almost turning him to an ice sculpture.</p>
<p>Blaze struggled to stand up, but his eyes were filled with horror. He knew that Banana Fairy was a Companion Beast with the Supreme Yin attribute, but he never expected such intensity. She was his nemesis. His Supreme Yang power was completely suppressed and useless.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1203'>Chapter 1203: Different Asuras</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen teleported to Blaze’s side planning on capturing him alive. After investigating for so long, he finally had clues, so he naturally had to get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>“Come to hell with me.” However, before Zhou Wen could touch Blaze, Blaze’s body suddenly bloated up. Light and fire spewed out from his body as he chose to self-destruct without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Damn it! Zhou Wen could teleport away, but there were other people chained in the altar. If Blaze self-destructed here, the others would definitely die.</p>
<p>Instantly, Zhou Wen made a decision. Almost at the same time Blaze’s body exploded, he reached out and pressed down on him, transferring his body away.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>In the distant Asura horde, a terrifying explosion happened. The explosive force exploded like a hydrogen bomb, instantly wiping out countless Asuras.</p>
<p>When Xiao saw this scene, his figure flashed and drew a strange trajectory as he charged towards the exit of the Asura Realm.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo chased after Xiao and held him back. Under An Tianzuo’s attacks, Xiao couldn’t escape for the time being.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan woke up after consuming the pill essence. Zhou Wen placed her by An Sheng’s side and waved his sword to rescue the other prisoners. Only then did he rush over, planning on helping An Tianzuo take down Xiao.</p>
<p>They could only make headway on the former principal’s disappearance through these people. He wanted to know if the former principal was still alive.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held Sword Pill and joined the battle. His sword art wasn’t inferior to An Tianzuo’s, but their styles were different. Although they had never fought together, it didn’t affect their performance at all. They had good teamwork.</p>
<p>Facing the siege of the two, Xiao was immediately at a disadvantage. He was in imminent danger.</p>
<p>Xiao was a ruthless person. He endured An Tianzuo’s full-powered strike and forcefully broke out of the encirclement. However, to his surprise, he didn’t rush in the direction of the Asura Realm’s exit. Instead, he charged towards An Sheng, Ouyang Lan, and company.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and An Tianzuo rushed over to stop him when Xiao suddenly did an about-turn and landed on the altar beside him.</p>
<p>The two of them immediately knew that something was amiss. Xiao’s target was the altar. He had rushed towards An Sheng and company only to divert their attention.</p>
<p>This person still has such a clear train of thought under such circumstances and has such executional ability. He’s really good. Zhou Wen teleported over and continued slashing at Xiao.</p>
<p>Xiao suffered An Tianzuo’s strike, but he recovered extremely quickly. Zhou Wen also recognized that it was the Xia family’s Invincible Connate Divine Art. He knew that ordinary injuries were useless against him. Zhou Wen even hid Great Brahma’s power in this strike.</p>
<p>Xiao didn’t dodge. Instead, he raised his chest and allowed it to face Sword Pill. The extremely sharp Sword Pill penetrated his body, causing blood to gush out and drip onto the altar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression changed slightly as he guessed the reason for Xiao’s actions. However, he had no other choice. He brandished Sword Pill, hoping to slice Xiao’s body into two.</p>
<p>Xiao’s body strangely retreated as Zhou Wen slashed out a foot-long wound in his chest, but he failed to slice him into two.</p>
<p>A large amount of Xiao’s blood landed on the altar. After the altar came into contact with the blood, it began spinning like a wheel.</p>
<p>As the altar spun, the stone pillars began to move.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that something bad would definitely happen, so all he wanted was to quickly take down Xiao. The Sword Pill in his hand struck out at ever-increasing speeds.</p>
<p>However, Xiao wasn’t bad at movement techniques either. Its Trajectory movement technique wasn’t inferior to Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal. Its speed was in no way inferior, and he was even faster than Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still at the Mythical stage after all. His stats hadn’t reached the Terror grade, so he was definitely at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>As the altar spun, something strange happened. The Asuras, who weren’t afraid of death, suddenly retreated like a tide and quickly left the altar.</p>
<p>When all the stone pillars formed a circle, a hole opened in the middle of the altar. Endless demonic aura spewed out from below as though a volcano had erupted.</p>
<p>An Asura rushed out with a demonic aura effusing from him. He looked similar to the ordinary Asuras.</p>
<p>He wore a mask and was half-naked. He wore a feathered dress with a strange bird tattoo on his back. He held an Asura Saber in his hand.</p>
<p>The difference was that this Asura’s hair, mask, feather skirt, strange bird tattoo, and Asura Saber were all purple, while ordinary Asuras were black.</p>
<p>A Terror-grade Asura? Just as Zhou Wen was in thought, the Asura slashed at him.</p>
<p>It was unknown what Xiao had done, but despite both of them being on the altar, the Asura ignored him and slashed at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>This strike was filled with a demonic aura. Be it its Strength stat or ability, it was completely different from Deva Asura.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen brandished his sword to block as the Sword Pill collided with the Asura Saber. A strange thing happened. The Asura Saber was like a phantom as the Sword Pill passed through it while the Asura Saber continued slashing at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen teleported away from the altar, having no plans on testing the saber with his body.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen appeared below the altar, the Asura actually chased after him and slashed at his neck like a ghost.</p>
<p>“Let’s meet again if fate allows it,” Xiao said with a chuckle before flying up. He drew a strange trajectory in the air and headed for the Asura Realm’s exit.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo immediately chased after him, hoping to stop him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare chase after him. He might be able to shake off the Asura with teleportation, but if he and An Tianzuo left, An Sheng and company would be in danger if the Asura changed targets.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only hope that An Tianzuo could capture Xiao while he fought Asura.</p>
<p>This Asura was very strange. Zhou Wen used teleportation to dodge his attacks and the Sword Pill had stabbed him several times, but it was as though he had stabbed an illusion. The Asura didn’t suffer any damage.</p>
<p>Could this be an illusion? Zhou Wen was puzzled. When the Asura slashed over again, he deliberately summoned a Poison Bat to block the Asura Saber.</p>
<p>The Poison Bat was cleaved into two by the Asura Saber. It couldn’t be more dead.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen secretly rejoiced that he hadn’t experimented using his body of flesh and blood. At the same time, he felt a headache. His attacks were useless against the Asura, so it was equivalent to his adversary being invincible.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it’s a power similar to a Spirit Body. I can only try Great Brahma. Zhou Wen summoned Great Brahma.</p>
<p>The four-faced, eight-armed Great Brahma with a spinning black hole on his back appeared in front of Asura. The Asura didn’t know what fear was as it slashed over.</p>
<p>Great Brahma automatically counterattacked and struck Asura’s saber. With a clang, Asura’s saber was blocked.</p>
<p>Seeing that Great Brahma could block Asura, Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>However, Great Brahma wouldn’t take the initiative to attack. As the Asura slashed down with his saber, Great Brahma blocked with his palm successfully, albeit unable to kill him.</p>

<p>The Asura was blocked by Great Brahma. Zhou Wen looked at the altar and saw that the exit in the middle of the altar had been sealed. The stone pillars had also returned to their original spots. He heaved a sigh of relief when no other dimensional creatures rushed out.</p>
<p>“Sis Lan, are you alright?” Zhou Wen went to Ouyang Lan’s side and asked.</p>
<p>“I’m fine.” Ouyang Lan felt much better after eating some pills. She said to Zhou Wen, “Little Wen, my father might still be alive.”</p>
<p>“You found the former principal?” Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up as he asked excitedly.</p>
<p>“We previously saw the undead Chu He in Netherworld City. We used some special abilities to extract some memories from him. Although the memories are incomplete, we still gained something,” Ouyang Lan said.</p>
<p>“What did you discover?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan pointed at the flag on the stone pillar. “This… Before Chu He was replaced, he had seen this symbol more than once on those fake expedition members.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if this had anything to do with the conclusion that the former principal remained alive. This only meant that they came from such an organization.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan continued, “Now, we have learned that this symbol is related to the Holy Temple. And after those two fellows captured us, they kept asking about my father. It’s very likely that they are looking for something. If my father has something they need and they haven’t found it, would you kill my father if you were in their shoes?”</p>
<p>“No.” Zhou Wen finally understood why Ouyang Lan said that the former principal might still be alive.</p>
<p>In other words, the former principal might be in the Holy Temple? Zhou Wen was somewhat excited. After such a long investigation, he finally knew where the former principal might be.</p>
<p>“Although it’s only a possibility, it’s better than blindly searching. Unfortunately, entering the Holy Land isn’t an easy task,” Ouyang Lan said with a sigh.</p>
<p>The Holy Land had a restriction on the level of entry. High-level humans couldn’t enter, and low-level humans were useless even if they entered. They would only have their fates toyed inside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had entered the Holy Land before, so he naturally knew that the six Holy Temples there looked like guardians of humanity, but in fact, it was an extremely strange place. If someone of a lower level were to investigate this matter, it would be no different from courting death.</p>
<p>“Sis Lan, this isn’t a place to talk. Get some rest. We’ll return together after I finish off Asura.” Zhou Wen got An Sheng to take care of Ouyang Lan and company before walking towards the Asura.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen yearned to chase after Xiao, but with An Tianzuo already chasing after him, he couldn’t join in the chase. Otherwise, Xiao might suddenly do an unexpected return, causing even more trouble if he captured Ouyang Lan as a hostage.</p>
<p>Xiao’s Trajectory movement technique was too bizarre. Even Zhou Wen wasn’t 100% confident that he could intercept him. Among the few Terror-grade creatures on him, only Banana Fairy and Demonic Neonate could match Xiao’s speed.</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit and Ice Maiden were slow. It would be impossible for them to stop Xiao if they were released.</p>
<p>And when Zhou Wen fought the Asura, Banana Fairy had to guard Ouyang Lan and company to prevent Xiao from launching a sneak attack. It was difficult for her to simultaneously take on another role.</p>
<p>As for Demonic Neonate, she had always been good at sneak attacks. Direct combat wasn’t her forte.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was good at movement techniques to begin with. He knew how terrifying an enemy like Xiao was. Zhou Wen could kill a Strength-type enemy like Blaze without any qualms.</p>
<p>Killing Xiao wasn’t that easy. He was very similar to Zhou Wen in every aspect. He was the type of person that wasn’t easily killed.</p>
<p>The power of Asura was extremely bizarre. Among the few Terror form powers Zhou Wen had, only Great Brahma could deal with him.</p>
<p>However, after observing for a while, Zhou Wen had other ideas.</p>
<p>If he used the back-facing side of Great Brahma, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to kill the Asura. However, its power was similar to Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World. Once it was used, even if he could kill the enemy, he wouldn’t obtain anything.</p>
<p>Since it was too late to rush over, Zhou Wen could only choose to trust An Tianzuo. He would stay behind to kill the Asura and see if he could get something good.</p>
<p>The power of this Asura should be demonic in nature. However, it also exudes a smell of death. Zhou Wen couldn’t tell what kind of power it was.</p>
<p>I’ll give it a try. I wonder if the power of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra can restrain the Asura’s power. Zhou Wen engraved the Ancient Sovereign Sutra on his Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>The Mythical Ancient Sovereign Sutra naturally wouldn’t be of much use against Terror-grade creatures. Therefore, Zhou Wen wanted to attempt to let the Ancient Sovereign Sutra break through to the Terror grade. Only then could it be effective against the Asura.</p>
<p>As the Ancient Sovereign Sutra was engraved on the Wheel of Destiny, a figure that resembled an Ancient Sovereign appeared.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo wasn’t slow, at least not slower than Xiao. However, An Tianzuo had a serious problem. His straight line speed was very fast, but his variability was inferior.</p>
<p>Once he changed directions, his speed would drop drastically.</p>
<p>As for Xiao, it was the opposite. No matter what kind of turns he did, it didn’t affect his speed, preventing An Tianzuo from catching up to him.</p>
<p>However, Xiao wasn’t able to shake An Tianzuo off. An Tianzuo had a good idea of Xiao’s general direction of escape, making it difficult for Xiao to shake him off.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo was ultimately one step ahead of Xiao. He occupied the exit of the Asura Realm and stood there with his broadsword, staring coldly at Xiao.</p>
<p>Xiao naturally understood that he had to rush out before Zhou Wen arrived. He couldn’t be entangled with An Tianzuo here, so not only did he not slow down, but he also rushed over even faster.</p>
<p>With his Terror-grade speed and excellent movement techniques, Xiao’s movement had long exceeded the limits of human vision.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo didn’t move, as though he was an extremely precise instrument. He didn’t move at all, but once he did, it would trigger a chain reaction.</p>
<p>In Xiao’s eyes, although An Tianzuo was just standing there, his entire aura was like an invisible net. The net seemed to be woven by a fairy without any flaws.</p>
<p>“The law shows no kindness, but so what? I’ll use kindness to break it.” Xiao’s eyes shimmered with a strange glint. He held the bow with the broken string and followed a profound trajectory, instantly arriving in front of An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo slashed down with the broken sword as though an invisible net had fallen. Countless criss-crossing sword beams sealed off Xiao’s path of retreat.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>Under the ruthless nomological net, the bow in Xiao’s hand and the armor on his body were shattered inch by inch.</p>
<p>Blood spewed out from Xiao’s wounds, but he remained undeterred. He charged straight at An Tianzuo like a person covered in blood, as though he wanted to perish together with him.</p>
<p>His eyes were peeled to An Tianzuo as though he was provoking him: “Don’t dodge if you have the guts.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1205'>Chapter 1205: Ancient Sovereign Battles Asura</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>An Tianzuo had already slashed out with all his might with the broken sword in his left hand, almost shaving a piece off Xiao, but he ultimately failed to kill him.</p>
<p>If An Tianzuo still had both his hands, he could smash the bloody Xiao into meat paste with one palm. Unfortunately, An Tianzuo only had one hand left.</p>
<p>Even so, An Tianzuo had no intention of retreating as he stood there like a mountain and looked into Xiao’s blood-stained eyes.</p>
<p>The blood that spewed out of Xiao’s body seemed to have a life of its own as it charged towards An Tianzuo. The bloody Xiao was like a blood-colored devil. Its ferocity made one shudder.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo didn’t retreat. At the instant Xiao slammed into him, An Tianzuo headbutted Xiao’s head.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The two unreserved Terror powers collided as Xiao’s head exploded. After his bloody body slammed into An Tianzuo, he was sent retreating. Blood splattered everywhere, no longer able to cling on to Xiao’s ravaged body.</p>
<p>The machine armor on An Tianzuo’s head shattered as his forehead kept bleeding. However, he ultimately guarded the Asura Realm’s exit and didn’t take a step back.</p>
<p>Seeing Xiao’s corpse fall, An Tianzuo’s expression suddenly changed. He immediately turned to look at the Asura Realm’s exit and saw a drop of blood that had spewed out of Xiao’s body falling towards the door.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo drew his sword and slashed, but he was still a step too late. The drop of blood landed on the door like a stone thrown into a lake, causing spatial ripples to appear before it vanished.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Li Xuan, Lu Bushun, An Jingyu, and company waited beyond the Bridge of Helplessness.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t Overseer and the rest out after so long?” Lu Bushun’s fat body paced around without stopping.</p>
<p>“Can you stop pacing around? My head is spinning from watching you,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“What has your dizziness got to do with me? That’s because your kidney is weak,” Lu Bushun retorted.</p>
<p>“Get out of the way!” Just as Li Xuan was about to say something, he suddenly heard a loud shout.</p>
<p>Lu Bushun and company immediately recognized An Tianzuo’s voice. All of them stood up warily and looked in the direction of the Bridge of Helplessness.</p>
<p>However, they didn’t see anything. There was nothing on the Bridge of Helplessness.</p>
<p>Li Xuan saw An Tianzuo rush out of the Bridge of Helplessness. At the same time, he saw a drop of blood shoot towards Lu Bushun at an unbelievable speed.</p>
<p>Li Xuan didn’t have the time to completely turn into his Terror form. All he could do was Terror transform his palm and block Lu Bushun’s forehead.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The drop of blood penetrated Li Xuan’s Terror-form palm like a bullet.</p>
<p>Thankfully, with Li Xuan blocking him, he bought Lu Bushun time. The latter’s reaction was fast enough. He did a roll as the drop of blood brushed past his head.</p>
<p>In midair, the drop of blood took Xiao’s form. Sucking two officers towards him, each of his hands grabbed one by the head. If he were to exert a little more force, their heads would explode.</p>
<p>“An Tianzuo, take another step and I’ll crush their heads,” Xiao said calmly.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo stopped. He knew that Xiao wasn’t joking. A person like him didn’t bluff.</p>
<p>“Overseer, don’t worry about us.” The two officers struggled with all their might, but they were like chickens. No matter how they struggled, they couldn’t escape the butcher’s hands.</p>
<p>“An Tianzuo, what do you say?” Xiao narrowed his eyes as he looked at An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>“Let them go and you can leave,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>Without a word, Xiao released his hand, but he didn’t leave immediately.</p>
<p>The officers surrounded Xiao, but An Tianzuo said indifferently, “Let him go.”</p>
<p>“As expected of An Tianzuo. I hope I can truly determine the outcome of the battle with you another time,” Xiao said as he reached out and grabbed at the air. A wisp of black gas rushed out from the heads of the two officers he had grabbed and landed in Xiao’s palm before disappearing.</p>
<p>“See you again,” Xiao said to An Tianzuo. When he turned around, he glanced at Li Xuan before flying away and disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>“Overseer, who was he?” Lu Bushun said in shock.</p>
<p>“An enemy, try your best to avoid him the next time you encounter him.” An Tianzuo glanced in the direction Xiao had left as though in thought.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo didn’t chase after him, knowing that he couldn’t catch up no matter how hard he tried.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan, do you know that person?” An Tianzuo finally cast his gaze on Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“He wore a mask, so I didn’t recognize him. However, if I knew such a powerful fellow, I would have an impression of him, but I have none,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“That’s strange,” An Tianzuo said after some thought.</p>
<p>Li Xuan knew that An Tianzuo implied that the matter was likely related to him, so he asked, “What’s strange?”</p>
<p>An Tianzuo looked at Li Xuan and said, “These people know our An family very well. They should know that our family values Jingyu very much. In that situation, his best choice of hostages should have been Jingyu and you, but he didn’t do that. Instead, he chose to distance himself and abducted two officers that even he might not know. This clearly goes against common sense.”</p>
<p>Everyone felt that it made sense when they heard that. In that situation, anyone would have targeted An Jingyu, followed by Li Xuan—who was physically closest to An Jingyu.</p>
<p>“Perhaps he knows how powerful I am and saw that An Jingyu was too close to me, so he didn’t dare attack him?” Li Xuan also agreed with An Tianzuo’s speculation.</p>
<p>“His goal was very clear. It wasn’t you from the beginning, but Lu Bushun. You only used your Terror powers after the target was chosen. Your advancement to the Terror grade happened in Netherworld City, so it was impossible for them to know about that, much less avoid you from the beginning. It still doesn’t make sense,” An Tianzuo said with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>“I’m stumped. I really don’t know that person,” Li Xuan said as he spread out his hands.</p>
<p>“Yes.” An Tianzuo nodded and didn’t say anything else as he frowned.</p>
<p>“Overseer, where are Young Master Wen, Adjutant An, and company? Do we need to help them?” Lu Bushun asked.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. Just wait here for them to return.” An Tianzuo didn’t return to the Asura Realm. Firstly, he was afraid that Xiao would return, and secondly, he was confident in Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In the Asura Realm, Zhou Wen’s body emitted a glow like a sun god. He had already fused with the Primordial Human Sovereign and was constantly transforming.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen landed on the top of Great Brahma’s head. When the Asura attacked again, his fist emitted a virile glow as he struck at the Asura.</p>
<p>The Asura’s attack was completely blocked by Great Brahma. Zhou Wen took the opportunity to strike with his fist, leaving him no room to dodge.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s punch struck the chest of the spirit-like Asura body which seemed impervious to any force. A fist-sized hole melted into existence when it was struck by Zhou Wen’s punch.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1206'>Chapter 1206: Alive</h3>
<p>It works! Zhou Wen was delighted.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Asura quickly recovered from the dent produced by the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s power. This left Zhou Wen somewhat vexed.</p>
<p>The power of the Primordial Human Sovereign gave Zhou Wen the ability to heal. No matter how badly he beat his opponent or how serious the damage was, they would ultimately recover.</p>
<p>This was because the usage of the Primordial Human Sovereign’s power to beat someone was actually saving them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that since there were traces of death powers in the Asura’s body, the power of Human Sovereign might possess true lethality.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Zhou Wen was overthinking things.</p>
<p>Could it be that the power of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra really doesn’t have any lethality? Zhou Wen had thought of this problem back when he was trapped, but he failed to come up with an answer.</p>
<p>In fact, the Ancient Sovereign Sutra wasn’t necessarily without lethality. It was just that Zhou Wen’s own insights and advancement direction had made the Ancient Sovereign Sutra lean towards this aspect. This eventually led him to condensing a strange Life Soul like the Primordial Human Sovereign.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, the Asura lunged forward again. Fortunately, it was blocked by Great Brahma.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood on Great Brahma’s head. No matter how the Asura attacked, Great Brahma could withstand his attacks. Even if Zhou Wen stood there in a daze, he wouldn’t be injured at all.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen thought about it, he put theory into practice. From time to time, he would throw a punch at Asura. The Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s power grew stronger, making Zhou Wen feel as though he was about to turn into light.</p>
<p>However, the power of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra remained the same. It didn’t have any true destructive power. The wounds that were inflicted healed in a short while.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the power of the Mythical Ancient Sovereign Sutra couldn’t really harm the Asura.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept pursuing lethality, but he realized that it was counterproductive. Not only did the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s power undergo Terror transformation, but it also weakened. The marks left on the Wheel of Destiny became shallower and shallower.</p>
<p>Realization dawned on Zhou Wen. He knew that he had been too stubborn. Some things couldn’t be forced.</p>
<p>After giving up on forcefully changing the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s characteristics, Zhou Wen restarted his deductions on the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. He engraved all his thoughts and insights into the Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>The sovereign forged from blood and fire led humanity to defy the heavens and seek the true meaning of life.</p>
<p>This was Zhou Wen’s previous understanding of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra, but being trapped for a hundred years had given him a deeper understanding of life.</p>
<p>Even if Zhou Wen didn’t deliberately think about it, he inevitably thought of this problem during his time in imprisonment.</p>
<p>What was life? In the past, Zhou Wen felt that as long as one was alive, it was life. However, after a hundred years of imprisonment, Zhou Wen realized that life wasn’t as simple as being alive.</p>
<p>Living happily, living in sorrow, living while traveling the world and taking in the world’s scenery—even lying in bed like a vegetable was living.</p>
<p>There were many ways of living. Ten thousand people had ten thousand ways to live, but which way was meaningful?</p>
<p>Different people might have different answers. Such questions might crop up in a person’s extreme boredom. Zhou Wen would occasionally have such thoughts and had seriously considered this question, but he hadn’t obtained a final answer.</p>
<p>From Zhou Wen’s point of view, there was no such thing as a better, more outstanding way to live. Some people were very happy just lying there under the sun, eating peanuts and drinking a bottle of beer. Some people put in all their efforts and only achieved happiness when they obtained higher achievements and status.</p>
<p>In fact, there was no right or wrong. As long as one could make themselves feel happy, they would be living their dream.</p>
<p>Such an understanding didn’t allow the Ancient Sovereign Sutra to advance to the Terror grade. Therefore, Zhou Wen knew that he hadn’t grasped the core.</p>
<p>What kind of life does the Ancient Sovereign Sutra pursue? Longevity? Zhou Wen thought to himself, but he felt that this wasn’t the answer.</p>
<p>Qi Refinement Warriors pursued immortality, but not the Ancient Sovereign. From the beginning, the Ancient Sovereign only wanted survival.</p>
<p>If the conditions for survival are satisfied, what should I do next? Zhou Wen planned on considering the problem from a different angle.</p>
<p>An Sheng and company watched Zhou Wen fight Asura. Although they couldn’t see the Terror-form Asura and Great Brahma, they could see the shockwaves produced by their battle.</p>
<p>From their point of view, Zhou Wen floated in the air and spent most of his time thinking. He would occasionally deliver a punch, but even if he stood there motionless, the Terror-grade Asura failed to injure him at all. The terrifying shockwaves shattered everything nearby.</p>
<p>“Madam, Young Master Wen’s strength is probably not inferior to Overseer’s,” an officer who had been rescued said to Ouyang Lan.</p>
<p>“My sons naturally won’t be bad,” Ouyang Lan said matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>An Sheng also nodded and said, “Young Master Wen is extremely talented. His future achievements will definitely not be limited to this. In the future, with Overseer and Young Master Wen presiding over Luoyang, it will definitely be as stable as a mountain.”</p>
<p>The other officers felt something amiss when they heard that.</p>
<p>As the saying went, a mountain couldn’t accommodate two tigers. In the past, they felt that any genius was an underling in front of An Tianzuo. There was always a main and a support, so there was naturally no need to worry about the two tigers fighting.</p>
<p>However, the ability Zhou Wen displayed made them worry. What if Overseer can’t suppress Zhou Wen? Will Luoyang become a battle between dragons and tigers in the future?</p>
<p>Experiences from the ancients and cruel reality told them that such things were too common. They naturally couldn’t help but worry.</p>
<p>However, Ouyang Lan and An Sheng didn’t have such concerns. This was because they knew that Zhou Wen’s ambition wasn’t that small. At the very least, Luoyang wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>At that moment, the light on Zhou Wen’s body stopped growing stronger. Instead, it gradually dimmed.</p>
<p>The Primordial Human Sovereign was still fusing with him, but the sun-like glow was converging as though Zhou Wen was degenerating from a god to a mortal.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s aura didn’t weaken as a result. Instead, it grew stronger.</p>
<p>A thousand people have a thousand ways of survival. With my intelligence, I’m unable to tell which way of survival is the correct one. However, I’m certain of one thing. The form of living I want depends on age. The things done at different ages should be things done at that age. At the age of five, I wanted an ordinary plush toy. That would be my greatest joy, but I failed to obtain it back then. This was because the money my father left me was only enough for my daily meals. If I used the money to buy a toy, I would starve for a week. Therefore, I chose to give up on the toy.</p>
<p>At this point, it’s easy for me to buy thousands of toys, but that happiness, that desire back then, can never be retrieved again. Zhou Wen closed his eyes as the past surfaced in his mind like a movie.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1207'>Chapter 1207: Human Sovereign</h3>
<p>Every compromise, every concession, every act of tolerance in the past—the reasons that seemed imposing to him in the past—appeared pathetic and laughable when he recalled them.</p>
<p>Life is long, but it doesn’t regress. No matter how ridiculous the things you wish to pursue today are, it will only be meaningful if you do it today. If you miss this day, even if there are countless tomorrows in the future, you won’t gain the satisfaction you get today… The glow over Zhou Wen had completely vanished. He didn’t seem to have the god-like halo of a sovereign, but there was an indescribable aura over him.</p>
<p>Perhaps they might be very humble and laughable, but that’s what I only want to do today. I only live in the now, not tomorrow. Zhou Wen’s eyes gradually became firm as the Ancient Sovereign in his body produced a strange resonance.</p>
<p>On the Wheel of Destiny, the mark that belonged to the Ancient Sovereign Sutra became more and more resplendent. It nearly illuminated the entire Wheel of Destiny space, but Zhou Wen’s body didn’t emit any light that could be seen with the naked eye.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body didn’t vanish. An Sheng and company could still see him, but Zhou Wen knew that the Ancient Sovereign Sutra had completed its Terror transformation.</p>
<p>Some Terror forms were invisible to others. Or rather, some powers weren’t something humans could see with their naked eyes.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen had only understood the Ancient Sovereign’s superficialities in the past, he now grasped the Ancient Sovereign’s spirit.</p>
<p>The Asura slashed out again. This time, Zhou Wen didn’t let Great Brahma stop him. He even unsummoned Great Brahma and allowed the Asura to charge at him.</p>
<p>The bizarre Asura Saber came with a monstrous demonic aura. However, from Zhou Wen’s point of view, the Asura wasn’t as ferocious and terrifying as before. It could even be said to be fun.</p>
<p>When one’s heart had no fear, there would no longer be any fear in the world. Even when facing death, fear was something that only brushed past.</p>
<p>At the instant the Asura Saber slashed in front of Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen finally moved. He extended his bare hand and grabbed the Asura Saber.</p>
<p>The sharp blade sliced into his palm as blood flowed out and stained the blade. The Terror-form Asura Saber lost its Terror powers and gradually appeared in An Sheng and company’s eyes.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Asura Saber. The Asura, who was holding the Asura Saber, also slowly regressed from his Terror form, allowing everyone to see him.</p>
<p>After losing his Terror transformation powers, although the Asura was still at the Terror grade, his stats dropped drastically in every aspect—it was no longer as powerful and invincible as before.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s palm snapped the Asura Saber and punched the Asura.</p>
<p>The powerful Asura was sent flying by Zhou Wen’s punch. His chest exploded as his body flew out like a cannonball and slammed into the Asura altar. His body shattered into pieces as blood and bones splattered across the ground.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan and company looked at Zhou Wen in a daze. Although there was no divine light or glorious brilliance, his figure was even more shocking.</p>
<p>The wise man’s saying is right: All demons and ghosts are paper tigers that can’t withstand a single blow. Zhou Wen sighed and retracted his fist, having the melancholic feeling of loneliness by being at the very top.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, the Asura that Zhou Wen had blasted apart instantly recovered under the power of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. He condensed his body again without any injuries.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t… Zhou Wen nearly staggered and fell from the sky. After all this time, the power of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra couldn’t really injure anyone. He had already forgotten about it.</p>
<p>Seeing the Asura charge over again, Zhou Wen felt so depressed that he wanted to vomit blood.</p>
<p>A certain part of his body emitted heat as Demonic Neonate rushed out. The demonic sword in her arms automatically unsheathed and instantly penetrated the Asura’s heart.</p>
<p>In the next second, the demonic aura over the Asura’s body was crazily devoured by the demonic sword. In the blink of an eye, it was completely devoured. Only a skill crystal and a stat crystal dropped.</p>
<p>After the demonic sword devoured the Asura, it circled around and returned to the scabbard in Demonic Neonate’s arms. Then, Demonic Neonate automatically returned to his body and transformed into a tattoo.</p>
<p>What’s going on? That’s it? Zhou Wen was still stunned.</p>
<p>He had gone through all the trouble only to have Demonic Neonate kill the Asura with a single strike. This was completely different from his expectations.</p>
<p>“Eh… Young Master Wen, why don’t we head back now?” An Sheng ran over and picked up the skill crystal and stat crystal dropped by the Asura before handing them to the stunned Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Ahem, alright. Let’s head back.” Zhou Wen coughed lightly and accepted the skill crystal and stat crystal.</p>
<p>“Sis Lan, how did you pass Netherworld City and the Bridge of Helplessness?” Zhou Wen asked on the way back.</p>
<p>Without suffering all the punishments of Netherworld City, it was impossible for them to reach the Bridge of Helplessness. They wouldn’t be able to leave their names on the Three-Lives Stone and retain their memories to enter the six realms of rebirth and existence.</p>
<p>It was understandable that one or two of Ouyang Lan’s entourage were special. However, Zhou Wen found it unbelievable that all of them were special.</p>
<p>“We aren’t very sure either. After we were forced into Netherworld City by them, we were captured and knocked unconscious. When we woke up, we were already tied to the altar,” Ouyang Lan said.</p>
<p>“So entering the Asura Realm wasn’t your choice?” Zhou Wen’s expression turned solemn.</p>
<p>Xiao and company could even determine which path An Tianzuo would choose, so it was obvious that they knew the An family like the back of their hands. Such an enemy made one shudder.</p>
<p>On the way back, Zhou Wen stole a glance at the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s Terror transformation information on his phone.</p>
<p>Terror transformation: Human Sovereign (S-grade)</p>
<p>It was very simple. Even the word ‘primordial’ had been dropped. It felt like it was regressing.</p>
<p>Demon God Body, Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, Godfiend Era, Singularity Universe, Great Brahma, Sword Pill, and Human Sovereign. Only the Chaos Egg and Slaughterer haven’t undergone Terror transformation. The path to advancing to the Terror grade shouldn’t be far for me, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>After walking off the Bridge of Helplessness, he saw An Tianzuo sitting there. An officer was treating his severed arm, but it didn’t seem to be effective.</p>
<p>Regeneration of severed limbs wasn’t easy for ordinary people, but not for a person like An Tianzuo who had all sorts of officers with him. There were also many who had healing abilities, so it wouldn’t be difficult for him to regrow the severed limb.</p>
<p>However, when such power was used on An Tianzuo, it didn’t seem to be effective. Although the wound had healed, he couldn’t regrow his severed arm.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, don’t you have a healing ability? Why don’t you treat the Overseer?” An Sheng handed the arm he had picked up to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“There’s no need,” An Tianzuo said directly before Zhou Wen could say a word. His tone was firm, without any intention of it just being an act of politeness.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1208'>Chapter 1208: Treatment</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“Little Zuozuo, there’s no need to stand on ceremony. We are family,” Ouyang Lan said as she took the arm from An Sheng and stuffed it into Zhou Wen’s hand. She continued, “Little Wenwen, ignore him. If he’s sick, he needs to be treated. Who doesn’t let doctors treat them? Please, treat him.”</p>
<p>With that said, Ouyang Lan winked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss as to what Ouyang Lan’s wink meant.</p>
<p>When the others heard Ouyang Lan call An Tianzuo Little Zuozuo, their expressions changed, but they didn’t dare say a word.</p>
<p>“I said there’s no need.” An Tianzuo got up to leave. He knew Ouyang Lan too well.</p>
<p>However, it was already too late. Ouyang Lan had already pressed down on An Tianzuo’s shoulder. An Tianzuo didn’t dare to shake her off by force. All he could do was say, “It’s just one arm. It’s no big deal. There’s no need to treat it.”</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan ignored An Tianzuo and said to Zhou Wen, “Little Wenwen, I call the shots. Ignore him and quickly treat him. I saw that you were great at treating wounds, so please treat Little Zuozuo.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen heard Ouyang Lan’s words, he immediately came to a realization. Ouyang Lan was referring to the time he beat up the Asura.</p>
<p>Then does she mean that she wants me to take the opportunity to beat up An Tianzuo? Zhou Wen held the severed arm and looked at An Tianzuo, understanding what Ouyang Lan meant.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally believed that even if he wanted to beat An Tianzuo up, he should have done it openly without using such tricks.</p>
<p>However, on second thought, I’m not beating him up; I’m treating him.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen no longer hesitated. He walked in front of An Tianzuo with the severed arm.</p>
<p>“Mom, I’m fine. There’s really no need to treat me.” An Tianzuo wanted to convince Ouyang Lan, but it was useless.</p>
<p>“Overseer An, bear with it. It does hurt a little during the treatment, but you’ll be fine soon,” Zhou Wen said as he threw a punch at An Tianzuo’s face.</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned. That was An Tianzuo, Overseer An, the War God from Luoyang.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo was stunned. He never expected Zhou Wen to suddenly hit him, so he failed to react.</p>
<p>“Little Zuozuo, this is a treatment. Don’t move.” When An Tianzuo reacted and tried to stand up, Ouyang Lan pressed down on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt every cell in his body crackle with exuberance and ignored everything else. He quickly threw out a punch that rained down on An Tianzuo’s face and stump, causing his angular face to cave in.</p>
<p>If looks could kill, Zhou Wen would have died ten thousand times over. If Ouyang Lan hadn’t held An Tianzhuo back, he would have long turned hostile.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo could tell that Zhou Wen wasn’t treating his injuries. He was clearly abusing the mandate he received for personal revenge.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s final punch struck An Tianzuo’s high nose, causing it to collapse.</p>
<p>Seeing that An Tianzuo couldn’t hold back, Zhou Wen took two steps back and muttered to himself, “From the looks of it, it’s mostly done.”</p>
<p>With that said, Zhou Wen shattered the broken arm in his hand and threw it at An Tianzuo. The broken arm automatically connected to the wound that had also been shattered by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>In a moment, An Tianzuo’s severed arm recovered. His face that had caved in from Zhou Wen’s strike also returned to its original state. The injuries from his battle with Xiao had completely vanished.</p>
<p>“Little Wenwen’s treatment is really excellent. You don’t look injured at all. We’re family, so there’s no need to thank him.” Ouyang Lan didn’t dare tease An Tianzuo further when she saw his cold expression. She hurriedly released her grip and pulled Zhou Wen away. “The weather today is rather fine, don’t you think so, Ah Sheng?”</p>
<p>“Indeed, Madam. The weather is excellent today. Why don’t we go back and have a good meal?” An Sheng hurriedly followed Ouyang Lan, not daring to stay behind to face the fuming An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng, you are most considerate. Little Zuozuo just doesn’t understand me.” Ouyang Lan walked as she spoke without stopping.</p>
<p>The group left Netherworld City and rushed back to Luoyang.</p>
<p>The stat crystal left behind by the Asura was a 96 Constitution Crystal. After Zhou Wen absorbed it, his Constitution only reached 81 points without any further breakthroughs.</p>
<p>The other skill crystal was named “Asura’s Evil”. It was a Terror-grade skill crystal that required 81 Constitution. It also required one to cultivate an Essence Energy Art with a demonic attribute, as well as a demonic Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and realized that he had never cultivated a demonic Essence Energy Art. After giving it a try, he realized that he couldn’t absorb it. All he could do was temporarily put it away.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Should I open up Netherworld City in-game? Zhou Wen was very interested in the dimensional creatures in the Six Realms. There were many Mythical creatures there, and there were also Terror-grade ones that could be killed. It was an excellent place for farming resources.</p>
<p>However, when he thought of Netherworld City’s punishments, Zhou Wen had no choice but to temporarily give up.</p>
<p>Ignoring everything else, it wouldn’t be easy to clear the final dream chamber. Zhou Wen didn’t have Li Xuan’s ability that was similar to an AI brain and datastream powers. Just the thought of being punished in a dream for more than a thousand years made even someone as determined as Zhou Wen shiver.</p>
<p>After returning to Luoyang, the An family began to study the possibility of entering the Holy Land.</p>
<p>At the very least, they had to let a Terror-grade human enter the Holy Land. Otherwise, they would only be sending themselves to their deaths.</p>
<p>“Sis Lan, do you know what they want from the former principal?” Zhou Wen privately asked Ouyang Lan when no one else was around.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan shook her head slightly. “I don’t know either. From what they said, I’m guessing that my father obtained something from Zhuolu.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen whispered, “Could it be the silver-haired Companion Beast in Xiyuan’s shop?”</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan was slightly taken aback. “Why would you have such thoughts? Typically, Companion Beasts can’t be traded. The chances of them seeking a Companion Beast isn’t high.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that Ouyang Lan was right. The Companion Beast they wanted was probably the strongest Companion Beast on Earth. The silver-haired Companion Beast didn’t seem to make the cut.</p>
<p>The thing they are looking for is definitely related to the strongest Companion Beast on Earth, but what is it? What did the former principal take out from Zhuolu? Zhou Wen thought about it but couldn’t figure it out.</p>
<p>“Why did you think of that silver-haired Companion Beast?” Ouyang Lan was a shrewd person. Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s question, she felt that there was something amiss.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen recounted the matter about the passcode. Ouyang Lan was the former principal’s daughter, so she should know the former principal better.</p>
<p>“That actually happened? Are you sure that the passcode was given to you by my father?” Ouyang Lan was very surprised when she heard that.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure.” Zhou Wen shook his head. He really couldn’t be sure.</p>
<p>“This matter is odd. There’s something wrong with that silver-haired Companion Beast. It’s right that you didn’t rashly open it.” Ouyang Lan pondered and was about to say something when she heard hurried footsteps from outside.</p>
<p>“Madam, the Cube has been activated again..” An Sheng’s voice sounded from outside.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1209'>Chapter 1209: The Cube Starts Again</h3>
<p>“Why would the Cube activate at such a time?” Ouyang Lan and Zhou Wen found it odd.</p>
<p>Ever since Human Sovereign slew Di Tian, there hadn’t been any more Battles of the Cube. Due to the existence of Human Sovereign, the dimension didn’t dare to randomly activate the Battle of the Cube.</p>
<p>He switched on his phone for the livestream. Indeed, everywhere in the Federation was reporting the restarting of the Cube.</p>
<p>However, the opening of the Cube this time was different from the previous times. There was no ranking. All the Cubes showed the same scene.</p>
<p>It was a red planet, and most of it was covered in hard rock. There were some spots on the planet’s surface that were bubbling with boiling magma. The heat made space seem distorted, making it look very strange.</p>
<p>“This is… Venus?” Ouyang Lan looked at it for a while before recognizing the planet on the screen. She looked at An Sheng in puzzlement.</p>
<p>An Sheng hurriedly said, “Yes, Madam. Many astronomers have confirmed that the planet on the Cube is undoubtedly Venus. However, it’s still unknown why the Cube is showing Venus.”</p>
<p>After a pause, An Sheng pointed at a corner of the Cube’s screen and said, “There’s a 72-hour count here. We don’t know what its use is for now. Everyone is guessing.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go to a Cube. There’s too little we can gather from a phone,” Ouyang Lan said to Zhou Wen as she walked. “From Earth, Venus’s brightness is second only to the moon. In ancient times, Venus was also known as Changgeng, Taibai, Qiming, Evening Star, and so on. The name Venus comes from the West District. Now that it’s suddenly appearing on Cube, I wonder if it’s a blessing or a curse.”</p>
<p>“Nothing good has ever come from the Cube’s appearance, right?” Zhou Wen said helplessly.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan asked An Sheng again, “Has anyone attempted to use the Cube to enter the rankings?”</p>
<p>“Someone has already tried, but they can’t enter the rankings,” An Sheng answered.</p>
<p>“Cannot enter the rankings? What are those fellows from the dimension up to?” Ouyang Lan frowned even more.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen and company rushed to the Cube, An Tianzuo and An Jing were already there. Seeing Zhou Wen follow Ouyang Lan over, An Tianzuo’s gaze met Zhou Wen’s for less than a second before he immediately turned to the side without looking at him again.</p>
<p>“Little Zhou, we meet again.” Qin Wufu was also there as he greeted Zhou Wen with a smile.</p>
<p>“Governor Qin, what’s the situation now?” Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to ask An Tianzuo, so he asked Qin Wufu.</p>
<p>Qin Wufu explained, “It’s been about half an hour since the Cube lit up. The various factions in the Federation are actively probing it, but there’s no movement from it. We can’t enter the rankings, nor is there a combat arena. There’s only the image and countdown of Venus.”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me they want to use Venus as a combat arena?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Qin Wufu said, “Many people think so. There are large amounts of basalt on the surface of Venus. Furthermore, the surface temperature is extremely high. The amount of carbon dioxide in the air exceeds 97%. There will often be sulfuric acid rain…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully listened to Qin Wufu’s introduction. He didn’t know much about Venus. He had heard that the surface temperature of Venus could reach more than 500°C. Even at the Mythical stage, it was very difficult to stay on Venus for long.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with current aerospace technology, it wasn’t easy to reach Venus. Some teleportation abilities could speed up interstellar traveling.</p>
<p>However, not many people had interstellar teleportation abilities. They were considered rare in the Federation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully sized up Venus through the Cube. At the same time, he used Great Brahma’s power to strengthen his vision, hoping to see something.</p>
<p>After some observation, Zhou Wen’s expression gradually turned solemn.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan noticed that Zhou Wen’s expression was odd, so she asked, “Little Wen, did you discover something?”</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Zhou Wen as he pondered for a moment before saying, “There seems to be a shadow slowly surfacing in the magma. However, I can only see a shadow. I can’t tell what it is.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, An Tianzuo and company looked at the scene of Venus in the Cube, but they couldn’t see anything.</p>
<p>An Sheng’s heart stirred as he looked at Zhou Wen and asked, “Young Master Wen, look at the countdown. Could it be the countdown to when the shadow surfaces?”</p>
<p>“It’s very likely, but I can’t be sure. The distance from the Cube is too far. Furthermore, the magma has blocked my vision. There’s too little I can see,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Everyone’s mood was somewhat heavy. For the dimension to suddenly activate the Cube and have it hosted on Venus, they were definitely up to no good.</p>
<p>As they couldn’t verify any of their hypotheses, they could only wait for time to pass and wait for the shadow Zhou Wen mentioned to appear.</p>
<p>Luoyang City had already entered a state of high alert. The citizens who could be evacuated into the dimensional zones began to move into them. If a terrifying creature appeared on Venus, it wouldn’t be difficult for it to reach Earth from that distance.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to leave, he suddenly heard someone shout, “Someone… There’s someone on Venus…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company, who were chatting, hurriedly looked at the Cube. The scene was still Venus, but a humanoid creature appeared on the screen. It floated above Venus and stared at the magma as though it was observing something.</p>
<p>After taking a closer look, Zhou Wen was certain that it wasn’t a human. Although the figure looked like a human, his entire body was like gold. It wasn’t in the form of armor, but his body was like a golden sculpture.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he couldn’t sense his aura through the Cube. He didn’t know what kind of creature he belonged to.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen and company were watching, the unknown creature suddenly plunged into the magma and quickly vanished.</p>
<p>Others only knew that the creature had burrowed into the magma, but Zhou Wen could roughly tell that it was heading for the shadow.</p>
<p>After the golden person entered the magma, it didn’t come out again. After waiting for almost an hour, there was still no movement.</p>
<p>After a while, another dragon from Western legends flew over and similarly arrived beside the magma. Like the golden person, it quickly rushed into the magma.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly felt that the shadow might not be a creature. Instead, it might be some treasure. Although the two fellows that had appeared hadn’t undergone Terror transformation, they were most likely at the Terror grade to be able to enter the magma so easily.</p>
<p>No matter how low their intelligence was, it was impossible for a Terror-grade creature to tempt fate, right?</p>
<p>Should I take a look? Zhou Wen was somewhat tempted. His Singularity Universe had interstellar teleportation abilities, so it would be very easy for him to reach Venus.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1210'>Chapter 1210: Successful Birth</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen was originally worried that this was the dimension’s ploy as a way to lure him over.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen quickly dispelled this thought because he saw Tsukuyomi on the Cube’s screen.</p>
<p>However, Tsukuyomi arrived at Venus in her Terror form. Ordinary people couldn’t see her at all. Zhou Wen nearly exclaimed when he saw Tsukuyomi dressed in white like a goddess of the moon.</p>
<p>However, Tsukuyomi didn’t enter the magma. She only looked at it for a while before turning around and disappearing again.</p>
<p>In the next few hours, Zhou Wen saw two strange creatures appear. One was an angel with black wings, while the other was a skeleton creature that resembled the Grim Reaper.</p>
<p>They arrived near Venus’s magma, but just like Tsukuyomi, they quickly left.</p>
<p>Not long after, the golden person and dragon that had entered the magma came out one after another before disappearing again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already very curious. He wanted to know what was in Venus’s magma that could attract so many powerful creatures. Even the Calamity-grade Tsukuyomi had come.</p>
<p>Although he was extremely curious, Zhou Wen held back and continued gaming at home. Thankfully, he obtained a Demon Blood True Dragon Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen had eight Demon Blood True Dragon Companion Eggs. All that was left was the Wu dragon pearl.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was grinding the Pill Furnace Mountain dungeon, he suddenly heard a notification on his phone. Then, a message popped up.</p>
<p>‘Light Concealment Sword and Night Immaculate Sword have had a successful birth. Obtained a Companion Egg.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback before he realized that thirty-six days had passed without him realizing it. Light Concealment Sword and Night Immaculate Sword had really produced a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>He hurriedly opened the Birth interface and indeed, he discovered a Companion Egg. The Companion Egg was somewhat different from the Light Concealment Sword and the Night Immaculate Sword. It wasn’t completely transparent, nor was it in vapor form like the Night Immaculate Sword. Instead, it was like a shadow, only a shadow without any form.</p>
<p>Could this be the Shadow Concealment Sword? Zhou Wen was puzzled as he opened the Companion Egg’s information. It was indeed the Shadow Concealment Sword.</p>
<p>Shadow Concealment Sword: Mythical</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The stats of the Shadow Concealment Sword were very similar to the Light Concealment Sword and Night Immaculate Sword. Its skills and Life Providence were somewhat different, but it was also a very good Mythical Companion Beast. Its abilities weren’t inferior to Light Concealment and Night Immaculate.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed. If the Birth ability could only give birth to Companion Eggs of the same grade, the birth of Mythical Companion Eggs wouldn’t be of much help to him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was originally looking forward to it. Even if the function couldn’t produce a Terror-grade Companion Egg, it wouldn’t be bad if it could produce an evolvable Companion Egg. However, it was just an ordinary Mythical Companion Egg.</p>
<p>A Mythical sword was indeed of little use to Zhou Wen with the Terror-grade Asura Saber.</p>
<p>He suddenly recalled that he could try out and see the effects a fusion of the three swords would have.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been looking forward to obtaining the nine Demon Blood True Dragon Companion Beasts because he wanted to fuse them, but he didn’t know if there would be any special effects after fusing them.</p>
<p>Light Concealment, Shadow Concealment, and Night Immaculate were said to be a set of swords. Furthermore, Light Concealment and Night Immaculate had an extremely high compatibility when matched to each other. Perhaps he could give it a try.</p>
<p>After incubating the Shadow Concealment Sword, he launched the synthesis interface and placed Light Concealment, Shadow Concealment, and Night Immaculate together. After the three swords were in place, a beam of light flashed on the synthesis column. The synthesis compatibility reached 99%. Furthermore, the three swords were glowing as though they were covered in a layer of divine light.</p>
<p>However, other than that, there was nothing special. There were no special hints.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and pressed the fusion button.</p>
<p>In the next second, the three swords glowed brightly and instantly occupied the entire screen, preventing him from seeing anything.</p>
<p>After a while, the light converged. However, after the light vanished, Zhou Wen looked again and realized that a Companion Beast wasn’t the product.</p>
<p>In the fusion interface, a Companion Egg appeared. There were words under the fusion and a percentage indicator. It was only at 1%.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen waited for more than ten minutes, but the percentage was still 1%. It didn’t move. He didn’t know how long the fusion would take.</p>
<p>After about an hour, it finally jumped to 2%. Zhou Wen estimated that it would take four days to reach 100%. He had no choice but to ignore it and continue grinding Pill Furnace Mountain.</p>
<p>His luck today was pretty good. Zhou Wen had actually obtained another Resurrection Pill Essence. Although its effects were inferior to the Dragon Tiger Elixir, it was still a good healing item. Even if his heart shattered, he could be revived with one pill.</p>
<p>Of course, he couldn’t really die. At the very least, it would only be effective if he ate it on his last breath.</p>
<p>After that, Zhou Wen’s luck seemed to run out. He farmed many Mythical creatures, but nothing dropped.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already figured out the respawn pattern of the Terror-grade creatures he had killed. They could respawn in a week, but the drop rate of Companion Eggs wasn’t high, so he didn’t gain anything.</p>
<p>As time passed, the shadow in the magma became more and more obvious. Zhou Wen was no longer the only one who could see it—many people in the Federation could see the shadow.</p>
<p>There were also impressive people who managed to deduce that the shadow was likely a building.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was certain that the shadow would appear when the countdown was up.</p>
<p>Now, people were guessing that the building in the magma was likely the arena for the Battle of the Cube. When the building appeared, it would be the true beginning of the battle.</p>
<p>However, some people believed that the building wasn’t a combat arena. It was very likely a dimensional zone—a dimensional zone on Venus.</p>
<p>There were also all sorts of random guesses. Zhou Wen also read some of them, but he didn’t really find them plausible.</p>
<p>Tai Sui has eaten all kinds of good stuff. Why isn’t there any reaction? Zhou Wen realized that most of the Dragon King Gu in the calabash had been eaten by Tai Sui. Only a segment about four meters long was left of its huge body. It wouldn’t be able to last much longer.</p>
<p>He was somewhat conflicted about Tai Sui’s advancement. Tai Sui was too infamous. If it advanced to the Terror grade and brought disaster to Zhou Wen, it wouldn’t be worth it.</p>
<p>After grinding all the dimensional zones he could with no harvest to speak of, all he could do was wait for the respawn time and study the shadow on Venus.</p>
<p>It had been two days since Venus appeared on the Cube. There were less than twenty-four hours left on the countdown. When Zhou Wen went to the Cube to take a look, he could see the true appearance of the shadow despite it not having surfaced.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1211'>Chapter 1211: Done</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Beneath the magma, one could see a metal palace. It was completely bronze and mixed with the magma, making it difficult to see it at its core.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully observed it for a while before roughly figuring out that the metal palace looked like a hemisphere. However, this was only the upper half. He couldn’t see the lower half, nor did he know how big it was.</p>
<p>The front of the hemispherical building appeared more than a thousand meters in diameter. There were latitude-like grooves along its parallels. At the topmost parallel, a platform could be seen. It was also circular and about twenty to thirty meters in diameter. It looked like an entrance, but it was sealed. There were no gaps, buttons, or handles.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at it for a while, unsure what the building was.</p>
<p>When his gaze accidentally swept across a corner of the hemisphere, Zhou Wen’s eyes suddenly lit up. In the grid divided by the longitude and latitude meridians and parallels, there was a tiny palm symbol engraved at the bottom periphery. In the palm was a golden circle symbol. It looked like Venus.</p>
<p>There’s actually a tiny palm symbol! Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>He held his phone up at the Cube’s screen to see if he could snap it, but he realized that it was useless. Even if he really stood on Venus, it was too far away. He had to dive into the magma and take a close-up shot.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hadn’t originally planned on taking the risk on Venus, but when he saw the tiny palm symbol, he knew that the metal building was definitely not a combat arena, but a dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the creatures that had appeared previously had safely come out after entering. Zhou Wen felt that it wasn’t too dangerous, so he planned on making a trip and snapping the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>However, before that, Zhou Wen needed to be fully prepared.</p>
<p>After the antelope returned, it slept on the sofa all day. Zhou Wen used to think that it was lazy, but now, he knew that it was heavily injured and was recuperating.</p>
<p>Without a Calamity-grade protecting him, Zhou Wen didn’t dare take Ya’er on adventures. He made her stay with the An family so that they could take care of her.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen’s relationship with An Tianzuo was terrible, he had to admit that An Tianzuo’s care for Ya’er was even more meticulous than his own.</p>
<p>He took Jade Rabbit and Ice Maiden with him, but Zhou Wen felt that Ice Maiden wasn’t of much use. That place was too hot, so Ice Maiden’s strength would be greatly weakened. Her combat strength would definitely plummet.</p>
<p>Deva Asura, Banana Fairy, and Demonic Neonate should be of considerable use. There was also the Seven Seas Dragon King. It was unknown if the fellow’s mucus was susceptible to high temperatures.</p>
<p>He put on the Invisibility Cloak, put on the earrings, and had Doctor Darkness possess him.</p>
<p>Although Doctor Darkness was only at the Mythical stage, his Light of Penetration and Darkness Right Hand were still very useful.</p>
<p>After making sufficient preparations, Zhou Wen used Singularity Universe’s ability and chose Venus as his teleportation target. He instantly arrived above Venus.</p>
<p>Singularity Universe allowed for distant teleportation, but it wasn’t precise enough. When Zhou Wen appeared on Venus, he didn’t land near the magma.</p>
<p>He was in a huge mountain range. The mountain was even taller than the Himalayas.</p>
<p>After gathering his bearings, Zhou Wen was about to head for the magma when he suddenly realized that there was a faint sound coming from the rift valley at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>What’s there? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly activated the Invisibility Cloak’s complete invisibility ability before carefully listening to the commotion in the rift valley.</p>
<p>After using Truth Listener to listen for a while, he realized that there weren’t any creatures in the rift valley. What made the sound was a fake flower.</p>
<p>The reason it was called a fake flower was that it had three red leaves. Above those were white petals. Its entire body was metal, looking nothing like a living plant at all. It looked like a work of art.</p>
<p>However, after listening carefully for a while, Zhou Wen realized that the metal flower wasn’t an artwork, but a living plant. Its roots were embedded in the rocks, and it seemed to survive rather well in the high temperatures and air that was filled with carbon dioxide. As the heat flowed, the leaves rustled slightly and emitted a strange sound.</p>
<p>The sound Zhou Wen had heard was from the leaf.</p>
<p>A metal flower? Zhou Wen was especially sensitive to flowers and didn’t dare head straight into the rift.</p>
<p>With a flash, he summoned a Golden Battle God Halberd and sent it flying into the rift valley.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Zhou Wen didn’t wish to use ordinary Companion Beasts to probe. The temperature of Venus was just too high. Typical Companion Beasts would probably be killed by the high temperature before reaching the rift valley.</p>
<p>The Golden Battle God Halberd flew down the mountain and into the rift valley. Not long after it entered, the Golden Battle God Halberd suddenly disintegrated before it could approach the metal flower.</p>
<p>It was somewhat similar to the shattering of tempered glass. The Golden Battle God Halberd immediately disintegrated into countless fragments. The fragments were much smaller than tempered glass shards—only the size of sesame seeds.</p>
<p>Before the fragments fell to the bottom of the valley, they vanished. The Golden Battle God Halberd’s name also vanished from Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast list.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt his heart ache, but at the same time, he was somewhat puzzled. He only knew that the metal flower’s power had disintegrated the Golden Battle God Halberd. As for what kind of power it was, he couldn’t tell.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen dispelled his plans to continue exploring. After determining where he was, he teleported towards the magma abyss.</p>
<p>Clown Mask’s teleportation ability was already very powerful. His teleportation distance was much further than before, so it didn’t take him long to arrive in the vicinity of the magma abyss.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t walk over directly because it was within the confines of the Cube’s field-of-view. Even if he went in his Terror form, ordinary people might not be able to see him, but he could still be seen by Terror-grade experts.</p>
<p>Therefore, after Zhou Wen determined the distance, he teleported into the magma to prevent himself from being discovered.</p>
<p>The moment he entered the magma, he experienced the terrifying temperature. Thankfully, he had already fused with the Terror-form Human Sovereign. Although Human Sovereign could only heal others and not himself, just the increase in strength produced by the fusion was enough to withstand the high temperature.</p>
<p>Not daring to stay for too long, Zhou Wen continued teleporting inside the magma and quickly arrived in front of the metal building.</p>
<p>Just as he had seen on the screen, there was a huge metal hemisphere at the front. However, in front of it, it looked even more spectacular, making him feel tiny.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that the temperature emitted by the metal building was even more terrifying than the temperature of magma.</p>
<p>Even with Zhou Wen’s Terror-grade power protecting him, he still felt a burning sensation.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on searching the metal building. He found the tiny palm symbol and forcefully dispersed the surrounding magma. He took out his phone and snapped a picture of it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief when the long-awaited download screen appeared.. He put away his phone and let it download slowly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1212'>Chapter 1212: New Mythical Serum</h3>
<p>He didn’t dare stay for too long. Since a Calamity-grade creature like Tsukuyomi had appeared, there might be other Calamity-grade existences.</p>
<p>It would be a tragedy if he encountered a Calamity-grade who wanted his life.</p>
<p>Using Singularity Universe, Zhou Wen returned to Earth. The coordinates of his destination were similarly inaccurate, so he didn’t return to Luoyang.</p>
<p>This is… Holy City? Zhou Wen carefully observed his surroundings and realized that he was standing in an alley. People were coming and going on the streets.</p>
<p>He used Truth Listener to scan the area and realized that this was Holy City.</p>
<p>Back then, Wang Mingyuan had used the power of the six Holy Temples to break through the barrier between Earth and the dimension and forced his way into the dimension. At the same time, he nearly destroyed the Holy Land.</p>
<p>This was Holy City, but it was different from the tragic scene back then. Holy City had been rebuilt—although it was slightly smaller than before, it could be considered a medium-sized human city.</p>
<p>However, Holy City’s defensive barrier hadn’t been repaired. It had lost its greatest defense and could only rely on human experts to protect it.</p>
<p>According to what Zhou Wen knew, the federal government led by Hui Haifeng had its headquarters in the Holy Land. Hui Haifeng had chosen this place himself. As for why he didn’t use the former president’s office, the reason wasn’t something Zhou Wen was privy to.</p>
<p>He took out his phone and took a look. It was still downloading, and it didn’t look like it would be done quickly.</p>
<p>Since I’m already here, it won’t be a bad idea to visit Hui Haifeng. Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to identify the buildings in Holy City and easily found the building for the president’s office.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to scan the interior of the building, hoping to find Hui Haifeng. He teleported over and realized that Truth Listener’s power couldn’t infiltrate the building.</p>
<p>The ring-shaped building was screened by an unknown force. Truth Listener was completely unable to probe the interior.</p>
<p>Interesting. I wonder if it was made by Hui Haifeng or an expert from the Federation. Zhou Wen couldn’t find Hui Haifeng, so after some thought, he gave up on the idea of looking for him.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” Just as Zhou Wen was about to teleport away from Holy City, a boy with a backpack walked over. He looked to be about five or six years old. He wore a pair of wide black-framed glasses that covered most of his face.</p>
<p>At that moment, the boy was looking at him in puzzlement, his eyes constantly sizing him up.</p>
<p>“I’m passing by,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“Passing by?” The boy looked back at the alley before returning his gaze to Zhou Wen’s face. His expression seemed to say: Are you an idiot?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a careful look and realized that the alley was a dead end. Furthermore, there was only one house in the entire alley, and there was only one door. Zhou Wen’s excuse of passing by seemed a little forced.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t mind the details and said with a smile, “I took the wrong path. I’ll leave now.”</p>
<p>“Wait,” the boy said as he placed his backpack on the ground. After opening it, he took out something and threw it at Zhou Wen. “Consider yourself lucky. Take this.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen caught it and saw that it was a palm-sized crystal bottle with a golden liquid inside.</p>
<p>“What’s this? Why are you giving it to me?” Zhou Wen looked at the golden liquid in the tiny bottle before looking at the boy in puzzlement.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the boy didn’t seem to be deliberately plotting against him. Ignoring the fact that he wasn’t suitable for such matters at his age, even if someone really wanted to scheme against Zhou Wen, no one knew that he had come to Holy City. It would be impossible for them to plot a scheme against him in advance.</p>
<p>“I forgot that ordinary people like you have never seen exclusive Mythical Serums before.” The boy revealed a look of enlightenment before saying to Zhou Wen, “It’s fine if you don’t know what it is. This is Mythical Serum. It’s very high-level and is somewhat different from the ones circulating on the market. Children above the age of three can use it. The effects aren’t as intense as ordinary Mythical Serums. It won’t completely fuse with the consumer from the beginning. There will be a long process. This reduces the burden on your body. The effects of the fusion will be better and it will be more suitable for your body. However, you are a little too old. Even if you use it, the chances of you advancing to the Mythical stage are very slim. I suggest you give it to any children of yours. It’s best if they are between three and six years old. Of course, you can use it yourself. It will still be beneficial.”</p>
<p>With that said, the boy packed his bag and picked it up again before turning to leave.</p>
<p>“Wait.” Zhou Wen found the boy odd. He didn’t know whose child it was.</p>
<p>“Is there something else you don’t understand?” The boy turned around and asked Zhou Wen without any signs of impatience.</p>
<p>“Why are you giving me this Mythical Serum?” Zhou Wen asked as he pointed at the tiny bottle.</p>
<p>The boy didn’t answer him and only asked, “Don’t you want it?”</p>
<p>“No.” Zhou Wen shook his head.</p>
<p>The boy nudged his glasses with his finger and looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement. “According to what I know, ordinary Mythical Serum is difficult to find. Many people are fighting to buy a bottle. Such a new Mythical Serum is priceless. Do you really not want it?”</p>
<p>As the boy spoke, he seemed to come to a realization. He looked at Zhou Wen and said, “You don’t have to doubt it. This Mythical Serum is genuine. It’s from the Hui family. Look at the mark at the bottom of the bottle. No one will dare forge the mark of the Hui family in Holy City.”</p>
<p>“Your surname is Hui?” Zhou Wen asked the boy.</p>
<p>“This has nothing to do with you. If you don’t want it, you can return the Mythical Serum to me,” the boy said.</p>
<p>From his expression, Zhou Wen had zero doubts that the boy’s surname was Hui. However, he didn’t know what relationship he had with Hui Haifeng.</p>
<p>“I believe this is a Mythical Serum and I want it. However, I didn’t put in any effort. I can’t take something from others for nothing. If there’s anything you need me to do, we can make a deal. This way, it won’t be me getting it for nothing.” Zhou Wen knew that there had to be a reason for the boy’s odd actions. If he really had something to do with Hui Haifeng, Zhou Wen couldn’t just ignore him.</p>
<p>The boy nodded as though he felt that Zhou Wen’s words made sense. However, he lowered his head and thought for a moment before muttering to himself, “But I don’t have anything I need you to do.”</p>
<p>“Anything is fine. If you have any difficulties, you can tell me,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>The boy shook his head. “If it’s something I find difficult, it’s even more impossible for you to complete.”</p>
<p>Why isn’t this fellow cute at all? He doesn’t sound like a child his age. Zhou Wen was somewhat exasperated.</p>
<p>The boy thought for a moment and said again, “How about this? You can’t do something if it’s too difficult. Lead the way. I’m going to Fireworks Lane to find a woman.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1213'>Chapter 1213: Fireworks Lane</h3>
<p>Fireworks Lane? Find a woman? Zhou Wen looked at the boy with an odd expression before using Truth Listener to scan Holy City. Soon, he found Fireworks Lane.</p>
<p>However, after figuring out where Fireworks Lane was, Zhou Wen’s expression turned even odder.</p>
<p>He originally believed that the name of the place was just something prone to misunderstanding. It was likely a normal place where the boy was looking for his family and friends.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen realized that Fireworks Lane was really as he first imagined. It was filled with colorful neon lights and strange men coming and going. Other than that were a bunch of strange women.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you don’t even know where Fireworks Lane is? I heard from Ah Quan that all men in Holy City know where it is,” the boy said with a frown.</p>
<p>“I know, but who are you looking for at a place like that?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“That’s my business. Just lead the way. Take me to the place and the Mythical Serum will be yours.” The boy clearly didn’t wish to say too much to a stranger.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen didn’t ask further. He wanted to go with him to see what he was up to.</p>
<p>“What’s your name? I have to know how to address you, right?” Zhou Wen asked the boy.</p>
<p>“Hui Wan.” The boy hesitated for a moment before giving his name.</p>
<p>“Did I catch it right? Hui Wan[1]? Is that your name?” Zhou Wen looked at the boy with an odd expression.</p>
<p>“Let’s go now. I don’t have much time. In two hours, I have to return for piano lessons. There’s also the violin, zither, and erhu after that…” The boy raised his wrist and looked at his watch.</p>
<p>“Why are you learning all that?” Zhou Wen was even more curious. In this era, he had heard of people forcing their children to cultivate in Essence Energy Arts. He had never heard of anyone letting their children practice so many musical instruments.</p>
<p>“Why do you have so many questions? If you aren’t going, I’ll go by myself.” As Hui Wan spoke, he walked towards the lane.</p>
<p>“Let’s go now,” Zhou Wen said as he walked. “Fireworks Lane is very long. Do you have the exact address?”</p>
<p>Hui Wan shook his head. “No.”</p>
<p>“Then do you know the name of the woman you are looking for?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“I only know that others call her Ah Cai,” Hui Wan said after some thought.</p>
<p>“It’s much easier with a name. We can ask around when we get there. Why are you looking for Ah Cai?” Zhou Wen continued probing.</p>
<p>However, Hui Wan didn’t answer him this time. He just walked by himself.</p>
<p>Seeing Hui Wan ignore him, Zhou Wen stopped asking. Since he already knew that he was going to find Ah Cai, he could just follow him and not let anything happen to him.</p>
<p>This was the central area of Holy City, and Fireworks Lane was in a relatively remote area. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that it was a slum.</p>
<p>To save time, Zhou Wen summoned an inconspicuous Companion Beast mount and took Hui Wan over.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Hui Wan didn’t sit on Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast. He took out a blanket from his backpack which had a Companion Beast sealed using some unknown method.</p>
<p>Although the Companion Beast didn’t belong to Hui Wan, he could control the blanket to fly with a few buttons on the blanket. As a five-year-old child, Hui Wan could easily steer it.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” Zhou Wen looked curiously at Hui Wan’s flying carpet.</p>
<p>“This is a Pet Flying Carpet that our family recently developed. It hasn’t been mass-produced yet, and is not sold on the market. If you want it, you have to wait at least three months. However, there will only be some trial products then. It won’t be sold on a large scale,” Hui Wan explained.</p>
<p>The Hui family sure knows how to rile things up. This thing is interesting. Zhou Wen sized up the flying carpet and roughly knew how it was done.</p>
<p>Although the method wasn’t difficult, the person who could do it was undoubtedly a genius.</p>
<p>Soon, the two of them arrived at Fireworks Lane. The combination of the adult and child, together with the flying carpet, was very eye-catching.</p>
<p>Many ladies standing at the entrance were looking at them. The bolder ladies even wanted to get their business.</p>
<p>Hui Wan wasn’t shy at all. He didn’t look like a five-year-old child at all.</p>
<p>“Little friend, you’re so cute. Wanna come to my shop to play?” A woman came over to tease Hui Wan.</p>
<p>“Hello, Sister. I’m looking for Ah Cai. Do you know where she is?” Hui Wan asked.</p>
<p>The woman who had reached out to pinch Hui Wan’s cheek suddenly had a drastic change in expression. As though she had been electrocuted, she retracted her hand and turned to leave. She even whispered, “I don’t know… I don’t know…”</p>
<p>“Sister, do you know where Ah Cai is?” Hui Wan asked as he went shop to shop to ask while sitting on the flying carpet.</p>
<p>However, anyone who was asked by him, be it men or women, seemed to be bitten by a scorpion. They turned around and left. Some shops even pulled down their shutters as though they were the plague.</p>
<p>Interesting! Zhou Wen originally wanted to ensure that Hui Wan could return safely, but now, he realized that this matter was much more interesting than he had imagined.</p>
<p>No matter if it was the women or the guests who entered the pubs, as long as Hui Wan asked about Ah Cai, all of them wanted to escape immediately.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Wen was somewhat interested in Ah Cai, considering how her name had such magical power.</p>
<p>As the two of them walked, the originally lively Fireworks Lane suddenly turned bleak and empty. Almost all the bars and clubs closed.</p>
<p>The reason why it was ‘almost’ was that one pub remained open.</p>
<p>The signboard of the pub was still lit and the door wasn’t closed. Zhou Wen saw that the signboard said “Non-Alcoholic Pub.”</p>
<p>Hui Wan was still a child after all. Although he was a little odd, he was only bent on finding Ah Cai.</p>
<p>Seeing that the Non-Alcoholic Pub was still open, he decided to go in and ask if the person inside knew where Ah Cai was.</p>
<p>However, before Hui Wan could enter, someone drew the curtains open and came out.</p>
<p>It was a middle-aged man. His face was fierce and he looked a little ferocious.</p>
<p>“Go back. The one you’re looking for isn’t here,” the middle-aged man said.</p>
<p>“Do you know where Ah Cai is?” Although Hui Wan was young, he was very smart. He could immediately tell that there was something odd with the middle-aged man’s words.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man ignored Hui Wan and said to Zhou Wen, “It’s still not too late to leave now. I’m afraid it will be too late if you wait any longer.”</p>
<p>He believed that Zhou Wen had been sent by Hui Wan’s family to protect him, but he was mistaken.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid it’s too late.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he turned his head and saw that on both sides of the street, a large number of people had appeared with weapons. They filled up both ends of the street.</p>
<p>They didn’t say a word as they surrounded Zhou Wen and Hui Wan. It looked like they wanted to trap them here.</p>
<p>“Come in.” The middle-aged man frowned slightly and moved aside to open the door.</p>
<p>[1] A homophone to playboy.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1214'>Chapter 1214: Faceless Buddha</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Before Hui Wan could say anything, Zhou Wen had already pulled him in.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t think much of these people, he couldn’t just massacre them in Hui Haifeng’s territory.</p>
<p>After entering the Non-Alcoholic Pub, Zhou Wen realized that it was empty. Apart from a male bartender and a waitress, he didn’t see a single customer.</p>
<p>“Little kid, what would you like to drink?” A girl in a bunny costume walked over and bent down to ask Hui Wan with a smile.</p>
<p>“I’m not drinking anything. I’m here to find Ah Cai. Is she here?” Hui Wan said.</p>
<p>“Give him a cup of warm milk,” the bartender said.</p>
<p>The bunny girl responded tersely and quickly placed a cup of hot milk in front of Hui Wan. “Little kid, try it. It’s delicious.”</p>
<p>“What would you like to drink?” the bunny girl asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What’s there?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Hot milk, iced milk, and yogurt,” the bunny girl answered.</p>
<p>“Isn’t this a pub?” Zhou Wen looked at the bunny girl in puzzlement. Why was everything milk-based? Was this a pub or a milk shop?</p>
<p>“Is this your first time in Fireworks Lane?” the bunny girl asked.</p>
<p>“It’s my first time here.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>“No wonder. Didn’t you see that our shop’s name is Non-Alcoholic Pub? In other words, we don’t sell alcohol. We only sell milk products here,” explained the bunny girl.</p>
<p>Selling milk at Fireworks Lane… Zhou Wen’s expression was odd. This was the first time he had heard of such a shop. Furthermore, it did business in a place like Fireworks Lane. It would be odd if business was good. It was no wonder it was so empty.</p>
<p>“Then give me a cup of warm milk.” Zhou Wen had no choice but to order a cup of warm milk.</p>
<p>The moment the bunny girl brought the milk over, the people outside had already blocked the entrance of the Non-Alcoholic Pub.</p>
<p>“Hand him over.” Zhou Wen heard someone shouting outside.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t random shouting. Only the leader spoke.</p>
<p>“Hand who over?” the middle-aged man standing at the door said coldly.</p>
<p>“Old Demon, stop pretending. Do you think we are blind?” When the leader said that, the crowd behind him was immediately enraged. Instantly, shouts reverberated across the sky as the huge crowd seemed eager to rush in.</p>
<p>“Is it convenient for us to be here?” Zhou Wen asked the bartender. He could naturally tell that the bartender was the head of the Non-Alcoholic Pub. Perhaps he was the boss here.</p>
<p>“Since you’ve ordered milk, you are my customers. No one can bully my customers here,” the bartender said calmly.</p>
<p>“But something doesn’t seem right outside.” Zhou Wen heard the commotion outside.</p>
<p>The bartender glanced at the door and said loudly, “Old Demon, let them in.”</p>
<p>With the bartender saying that, the clamoring outside immediately quietened down.</p>
<p>After a while, Old Demon led the leader in. However, he was the only one who entered. Even though there were many people outside, they only stood outside obediently. No one dared to enter.</p>
<p>“Brother Milk.” The leader saw the bartender and squeezed out a smile.</p>
<p>“Brother Jin, they are just two insensible children. They don’t have any ill intentions. Don’t make things difficult for them,” said Brother Milk.</p>
<p>“Brother Milk, aren’t you mocking me? Just call me Old Jin. Since you’ve already said the word, I won’t say anything. I can choose not to capture them. However, Brother Milk, don’t make things difficult for us. We can’t let them stay in Fireworks Lane any longer,” said Old Jin.</p>
<p>Before Brother Milk could say anything, Hui Wan said directly, “Why can’t I stay in Fireworks Lane? I want to find Ah Cai. I won’t leave without finding her.”</p>
<p>“Brother Milk, as you can see, it’s not that we don’t aren’t cutting you some slack and want to make things ugly, but we really can’t answer our boss when we return,” Old Jin said with a bitter expression.</p>
<p>“Sorry to trouble you. Give me some time,” Brother Milk said as he looked at Zhou Wen. “Shouldn’t you take him back?”</p>
<p>“It’s none of my business if he wants to come or leave,” Zhou Wen said with a shrug. He didn’t mind watching the matter escalate. It was getting more and more interesting.</p>
<p>Brother Milk was taken aback when he heard that. Old Jin read the situation well. Seeing what was happening, he got up and said, “How about this, Brother Milk? I’ll wait for you outside. I reckon my boss won’t be able to make it here in half an hour. I really can’t guarantee anything after that. You know my boss’s temper.”</p>
<p>“Sorry to trouble you, Old Jin,” said Brother Milk.</p>
<p>“Brother Milk, there’s no need for that! I’m just doing my part.” As Old Jin spoke, he left the Non-Alcoholic Pub. However, he didn’t retreat. He let his men wait outside.</p>
<p>“Are you really not leaving?” Brother Milk asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“You have to ask him.” Zhou Wen pointed at Hui Wan.</p>
<p>“I’m not leaving. I won’t go back unless I find Ah Cai,” Hui Wan said firmly.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you from the Hui family?” Brother Milk asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Brother Milk said, “It doesn’t matter if you’re from the Hui family. Since you brought him here, you have the obligation to take him back safely. Leave now. You heard what Old Jin said. In half an hour, if that person really comes, I’m afraid you won’t have a chance to leave.”</p>
<p>“He’s just looking for someone. Is there a need to go that far? This child is from the Hui family after all,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Old Demon said coldly, “It looks like you are a greenhorn who doesn’t know anything. It’s because he’s from the Hui family that it’s dangerous. Why would the Hui family let a person like you bring a child out?”</p>
<p>“I was just about to ask; what’s going on?” Zhou Wen was also extremely curious.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng was now the federal President, and Holy City was now the Hui family’s territory. It was too strange for him to say that it was dangerous because Hui Wan was from the Hui family.</p>
<p>“You really don’t know anything? That old saying is right. The ignorant are fearless.” The bunny girl smiled and roughly explained the situation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s jaw nearly dropped when he heard the story. He never expected such a thing.</p>
<p>Someone had actually gone to the Hui family to snatch a woman. Furthermore, the Hui family didn’t dare demand her return. The woman who had been taken away was the Ah Cai that Hui Wan had mentioned. The person who snatched her was the boss of Fireworks Lane. No one knew his real name, but they knew that he had a nickname—Faceless Buddha.</p>
<p>“Is it possible for a person to go to the president’s residence to take a woman away without the president having the guts to demand her return?” Zhou Wen felt like he was listening to a fantasy.</p>
<p>“It’s not a possibility, but a fact. Don’t underestimate Fireworks Lane. This is Holy City’s underground market. There are countless good things flowing here from all over the Federation every day. The number of transactions is unimaginable for you. If the president is the ruler of Holy City’s day, then Faceless Buddha is the king of Holy City’s night.” Old Demon snorted coldly. “Old Jin and company gave you a chance to leave Fireworks Lane on account of Brother Milk. If you don’t leave now, when that Faceless Buddha comes, even the heavens won’t be able to save you.. Even if Hui Haifeng comes personally, he might not be able to take the two of you back.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1215'>Chapter 1215: Super Genius</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen still found it unbelievable. He dares to fight the entire Federation with his strength alone, and in such a blatant manner?</p>
<p>Old Demon said coldly, “Hui Haifeng only represents the federal government. Now, there’s not only the federal government on Earth, but there are also the League of Guardians, the Holy Spirit Association, the overseas faction, and others. And these factions need a place to exchange resources. And that’s the underground market at Fireworks Lane. Here, as long as you have money, you can exchange for anything you want. Even the six families need resources that they don’t have. There aren’t many people who can balance the relationships between the various factions and complete this matter. Do you think the Hui family can touch such a person?”</p>
<p>With Old Demon giving this explanation, Zhou Wen understood that the Faceless Buddha in Fireworks Lane didn’t only represent himself. It also represented the interests of the League of Guardians, the Holy Spirit Association, overseas, and even the Federation itself.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that the federation president didn’t control the entire federal government, even if he could fully control the federal government, he still needed to consider carefully if he wanted to touch Fireworks Lane and Faceless Buddha.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen still found it ridiculous for Faceless Buddha to abduct a woman from the Hui family. There had to be another reason.</p>
<p>“Who’s that Ah Cai? Why would Faceless Buddha abduct her?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid only Faceless Buddha knows why. Perhaps you can ask the Hui family. However, Faceless Buddha once ordered that no one from the Hui family is allowed to enter Fireworks Lane. He’s a man of action. Previously, there were people from the six families who refused to believe his claim and were killed in Fireworks Lane.” Old Demon glanced at Hui Wan. Clearly, the Hui family member he was referring to was Hui Wan.</p>
<p>“Faceless Buddha is a big baddie. He snatched Ah Cai away,” Hui Wan said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if Faceless Buddha is a big baddie, but ever since he came to Fireworks Lane, this place, which was at the bottom of society and suffered bullying, is no longer having women like us suffer random bullying. No one dares to wantonly kill for fun,” the bunny girl said seriously.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but fall silent when he heard that. He had previously heard of it and knew that what the bunny girl said was very pragmatic.</p>
<p>As the Earth’s anomalies became more and more intense, and the environment became worse, many women who didn’t have the ability to protect themselves or even obtain food had to engage in special work.</p>
<p>However, those who could come to such a place to enjoy themselves were people with power or money. Furthermore, the mental pressure was too great. Under the circumstances where the laws were weak, it was very common for women to be bullied. They weren’t paid for their service and might even be beaten or killed.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Holy City. Many human cities had the same problem.</p>
<p>“In that case, Faceless Buddha is not a bad person,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“He’s not human. He’s the Buddha of Fireworks Lane, the god here,” the bunny girl corrected him seriously.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, it’s time for us to leave.” Zhou Wen didn’t wish to be embroiled in such a complicated matter. All he wanted was to take Hui Wan back safely.</p>
<p>“I’m not going back until I see Ah Cai.” Hui Wan was very insistent. However, he wasn’t like ordinary children who did things purely out of spite. He had his own independent thoughts.</p>
<p>“I want to see Faceless Buddha and ask him what’s needed for him to release Ah Cai. As long as he’s willing to release Ah Cai, I’m willing to pay any price. He can take anything within the confines of my abilities—money or the research products of our Hui family,” Hui Wan continued.</p>
<p>“Then how great is the range of your abilities? How much say do you have?” Old Demon asked Hui Wan with contempt.</p>
<p>He didn’t believe that a five-year-old child could have many resources at his disposal. Even if his surname was Hui—even if he was Hui Haifeng’s son—he would at most have some pocket money that ordinary children couldn’t have.</p>
<p>If such money could settle Faceless Buddha, Ah Cai wouldn’t have been forced to leave the Hui family.</p>
<p>It looked like Hui Wan had come prepared. He opened his bag and took out some documents.</p>
<p>“These are the shares of the dimensional zones that I have in Holy City. There are also some shares of the dimensional zones in the North and South District that I bought from the six families. As long as the six families don’t collapse, the profits should be very stable. There’s also my company here. I own 73% of the shares…” Hui Wan gave a general introduction.</p>
<p>Everyone was dumbfounded when they heard that. Even Brother Milk’s expression changed when he looked at Hui Wan. He picked up some documents and looked at them before saying with a strange expression, “These are all genuine.”</p>
<p>Old Demon also picked up one of the documents and took a look. He immediately shouted, “Is the Great Fun Group yours?”</p>
<p>Hui Wan nodded. “Strictly speaking, it belongs to me after I acquired it half a year ago.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised when he heard that. He had recently heard of the name “Great Fun Group.” Its main business was a project that combined Companion Beasts and technology. For example, the construction of some Companion Beast power stations was the business of the Great Fun Group. The An family and the Great Fun Group had business partnerships, so it could be said that it was a large corporation that covered the Federation.</p>
<p>“You’re still so young. Is your family at ease handing such a huge corporation to you?” the bunny girl said to Hui Wan in disbelief.</p>
<p>However, Hui Wan corrected her seriously. “No, it’s not from my family. I bought it myself.”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t the money you used to acquire it come from your family?” Old Demon said.</p>
<p>“No, my money was obtained by selling my inventions and investments. Apart from the experimental equipment and materials that my mother gave me in the beginning, I didn’t take a single cent from my family for nothing,” Hui Wan said.</p>
<p>“What inventions do you have?” Old Demon asked.</p>
<p>“A recent invention that has been pushed to the market. It’s called a Companion Egg backpack. You should have heard of it, right?” Hui Wan said.</p>
<p>“You invented the Companion Egg backpack?” The bunny girl and Old Demon widened their eyes as they looked at Hui Wan as though they were looking at a monster.</p>
<p>They really couldn’t believe that the thing had been invented by such a young child.</p>
<p>“If you don’t believe me, you can take a look at the contract I signed with the six families. The Companion Egg backpacks made by the six families have all purchased my technology.” Hui Wan took out some documents from the thick stack of documents for them to see.</p>
<p>After Old Demon and company read it, they couldn’t treat Hui Wan as a child when they looked at him again.</p>
<p>“As long as Faceless Buddha is willing, I can use all of this to exchange for Ah Cai,” Hui Wan said.</p>
<p>“Although you are very sincere, there are some things that can’t be resolved with money. It’s best you leave quickly,” said Brother Milk.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally knew that if money could resolve the problem, Faceless Buddha wouldn’t have abducted Ah Cai from the Hui family.</p>
<p>“Why? The combined value of these can buy half of Holy City. Can’t it satisfy Faceless Buddha?” Hui Wan clearly didn’t understand.</p>
<p>He might be a super genius in some aspects, but in most aspects, he was still a child.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1216'>Chapter 1216: Faceless Buddha</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“Not enough.” Brother Milk didn’t explain much. He only said two simple words.</p>
<p>“How much more is needed?” Hui Wan asked seriously.</p>
<p>“A hundred times more.” Brother Milk gave a number only because he wanted Hui Wan to return. He didn’t believe that Hui Wan could really do it, at least not in a short period of time.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll earn more money. When I return, I can exchange it for Ah Cai.” Hui Wan was only a child after all, so he took Brother Milk’s words seriously.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll send you out.” Brother Milk sent Zhou Wen and Hui Wan out.</p>
<p>When Old Jin saw Brother Milk take them out, he couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief. He didn’t wish to clash with Brother Milk.</p>
<p>“Everyone, they are just children. Can you not make things difficult for them and give them a way out?” Brother Milk said as he looked at the crowd.</p>
<p>“Since you said so, it must be a misunderstanding,” Old Jin hurriedly added.</p>
<p>Most people took Brother Milk’s prestige into consideration and automatically made way.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thanked Brother Milk and company. Just as he was about to leave with Hui Wan, he suddenly heard the strange sounds of hooves.</p>
<p>With the sound of hooves, everyone’s expression changed. Even the color in Brother Milk’s face drained.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately realized what had happened. He turned his head and looked in the direction of the sound of hooves. He saw a person slowly walking over on a two-headed dragon.</p>
<p>The two-headed dragon’s body was pitch-black, as though it was carved from black gemstones. Every scale emitted a dark light, as though it was an abyss in a mirror.</p>
<p>The person sitting on the double-headed dragon’s back was extremely majestic. He was nearly three meters tall and looked like a giant. However, although he was majestic, he didn’t appear clumsy. His body was in a muscular, streamlined shape, making him exude explosive strength.</p>
<p>Compared to the tight black armor, he looked even more domineering and mysterious.</p>
<p>No one could see the face underneath the faceless mask. Upon seeing the mask, Zhou Wen roughly guessed who he was.</p>
<p>Actually, there was no need to guess. The reaction of the people in Fireworks Lane was enough to explain everything. The person who had arrived was likely Faceless Buddha—a godlike existence in Fireworks Lane.</p>
<p>Wherever Faceless Buddha passed, everyone automatically retreated to the sides of the street. They pressed their palms together and bowed their heads as though they were praying to Buddha. No one dared to look up at Faceless Buddha.</p>
<p>Old Jin’s face was pale. When he saw Faceless Buddha approach from afar, he immediately knelt down and said, “Your Excellency, I saw that they were only children and thought it was a prank, so I wanted to spare them…”</p>
<p>Even Brother Milk, who was rather respected, was less carefree in front of Faceless Buddha. He said with a heavy expression, “Your Excellency, this matter has nothing to do with Old Jin and company. I forced Old Jin to release them. The two of them are only children. You won’t hold anything against two children, right?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t I say that the Hui family isn’t allowed to enter Fireworks Lane?” Faceless Buddha said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Brother Milk answered bitterly.</p>
<p>“Are they from the Hui family?” Faceless Buddha asked again.</p>
<p>Brother Milk opened his mouth, not knowing how to answer.</p>
<p>“I’m from the Hui family. My name is Hui Wan. I came independently. It has nothing to do with them,” Hui Wan said as he came in front of the horse. He took out the various contracts in his backpack and introduced the value of the items.</p>
<p>“As long as you release Ah Cai, these will all be yours. If you think it’s not enough, you can name a price. It doesn’t matter if it’s ten times or a hundred times more; I’ll give it to you as soon as possible.” Hui Wan’s tiny body stood in front of the majestic double-headed dragon, showing zero fear.</p>
<p>“Even if it’s a thousand or ten thousand times, it won’t be enough to exchange for Ah Cai,” Faceless Buddha said indifferently.</p>
<p>Hui Wan froze. Although he was good at earning money, it would still be too difficult to earn a thousand or ten thousand times more. Furthermore, even if he could amass that fortune, the other party wasn’t willing to exchange Ah Cai for it. This made him feel unprecedented helplessness.</p>
<p>Only then did Hui Wan look like an ordinary child. He looked at Zhou Wen, at a loss, his eyes filled with helplessness and unease.</p>
<p>The two-headed dragon continued walking forward and was about to touch Hui Wan. Brother Milk thought that Faceless Buddha was really going to attack Hui Wan, so he hurriedly pulled Hui Wan away. However, he didn’t dare attack Faceless Buddha. He pleaded, “Your Excellency, he’s only a child. Even if his surname is Hui, what the Hui family has done has nothing to do with him. Please spare him.”</p>
<p>Only Brother Milk had the guts to speak. The others, like Old Jin and Old Demon, didn’t even dare breathe. The pressure Faceless Buddha gave was too terrifying. This person seemed to be born with a terrifying pressure.</p>
<p>Despite Brother Milk’s pleas, the two-headed dragon didn’t stop. However, Faceless Buddha didn’t attack Hui Wan either. The two-headed dragon walked past them and arrived in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“When did your surname become Hui?” Faceless Buddha looked at Zhou Wen and asked out of the blue. It left Brother Milk, Old Demon, and company taken aback.</p>
<p>“When did my surname become Hui? Don’t you know my surname?” Zhou Wen said with a smile. He had already recognized the person the moment Faceless Buddha appeared.</p>
<p>“When did you arrive?” Faceless Buddha asked again.</p>
<p>“I just arrived today,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“When are you leaving?” Faceless Buddha asked again.</p>
<p>“I originally planned on leaving now, but since you are here, I have to let you bleed a little. I’ll leave after having a feast,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Come on up.” Faceless Buddha turned the two-headed dragon around, clearly letting Zhou Wen sit on it.</p>
<p>This action made everyone in Fireworks Lane widen their eyes. Although Faceless Buddha was the king of Fireworks Lane, he had always been a loner. He never took anyone with him. No one had ever been to his residence, much less ride with him.</p>
<p>“I brought this child here. I have the responsibility to take him back safely. Can I bring him with me?” Zhou Wen knew that this person wasn’t someone who would attack a child.</p>
<p>“Whatever. It’s up to you.” Faceless Buddha’s answer left everyone gaping in surprise.</p>
<p>Old Demon, Old Jin, and company stole glances at Zhou Wen. They had never heard of anyone who could make Faceless Buddha make such a concession.</p>
<p>Back when the Cape family beat up a woman in Fireworks Lane, Faceless Buddha broke all their limbs and ordered that the Cape family was not to enter Fireworks Lane for three months.</p>
<p>However, a young man from the Cape family ignored him and came to Fireworks Lane. In the end, he was mercilessly killed by Faceless Buddha. The Cape family failed to do anything to him.</p>
<p>Now, because of Zhou Wen’s words, not only did Faceless Buddha let Hui Wan go, but he was also willing to let Hui Wan, a member of the Hui family, go to his house. This was unbelievable.</p>
<p>Hui Wan also looked at Zhou Wen in a daze as he stood there motionless. It was unknown what he was thinking.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen grabbed Hui Wan and got onto the two-headed dragon’s back.. Under the gazes of everyone in Fireworks Lane, the two-headed dragon carried them and vanished deep into the long street.</p>

<h3 id='chapter1217'>Chapter 1217: Reunion</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>In an ordinary-looking yard, there were many plants—all kinds of grass and flowers. Most of them were edible vegetables.</p>
<p>These weren’t plant-type dimensional creatures, but the most ordinary plants on Earth.</p>
<p>“Do you still have to wear a mask at home?” Zhou Wen said to Faceless Buddha who was sitting on the stone bench in the yard.</p>
<p>“I just don’t want to scare others,” Faceless Buddha said as he took off his mask, revealing a face that wasn’t ugly, but was extremely ferocious. Just a look from him was enough to make one shiver.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Ah!” When Hui Wan saw that face, he immediately retreated in fright as though he had seen a ferocious serial killer.</p>
<p>The person known as the Faceless Buddha was none other than Zhou Wen’s classmate, Gu Dian. In the past, Gu Dian had also been a member of the Xuanwen Club. Zhou Wen never expected him to become the famous Faceless Buddha of Fireworks Lane.</p>
<p>“Why did you come here to become Faceless Buddha?” Zhou Wen ignored the terrified Hui Wan and asked Gu Dian.</p>
<p>“To survive.” Gu Dian said it very casually as though it was something extremely normal. However, Zhou Wen could sense the pain and helplessness contained within.</p>
<p>“Ah Cai!” Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, Hui Wan shouted excitedly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned his head and saw Hui Wan excitedly rushing towards a beautiful girl in a cloak. Zhou Wen finally saw the legendary Ah Cai.</p>
<p>She was a delicate and gentle woman who looked to be less than twenty years old. She had a sweet smile that warmed a person’s heart.</p>
<p>“Ah Cai, you don’t have to be afraid. I’ll protect you.” Hui Wan mustered his courage and stood in front of Ah Cai. He glanced at Gu Dian and his legs went limp again, but he didn’t retreat. He remained very firm.</p>
<p>“Little Wan, no one will hurt me,” Ah Cai said gently as she stroked Hui Wan’s head.</p>
<p>“Didn’t he force you here?” Hui Wan wanted to point at Gu Dian, but when he saw him, he didn’t dare do so.</p>
<p>“No, I came here willingly with him. Although he looks very fierce, he’s very nice and gentle,” Ah Cai said.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to be afraid. I… Zhou Wen and I will protect you.” Hui Wan didn’t believe her. No matter how he looked at Gu Dian, he didn’t seem like a very nice and gentle person.</p>
<p>“Take him out to play,” Gu Dian said to Ah Cai.</p>
<p>Ah Cai responded and took Hui Wan out of the yard.</p>
<p>Only then did Gu Dian say to Zhou Wen, “Is it a coincidence that you came here, or are you here specifically for me?”</p>
<p>“A coincidence. After I returned to school, I asked around for your whereabouts, but no one knew where you were. What happened? Why did you become Faceless Buddha?” Zhou Wen opened the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and Great Brahma. One blocked any possible nomological forces, while the other prevented anyone nearby from eavesdropping on their conversation.</p>
<p>Gu Dian said, “Many factions need a place where they can conduct transactions. And the person presiding over this place has to be unrelated to any party. At the same time, he has to be trusted by many parties.”</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t be difficult to find such a person,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“It’s not difficult to find such a person, but there aren’t many people who aren’t human,” Gu Dian said expressionlessly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but fall silent. Half of Gu Dian’s bloodline wasn’t human. Although Zhou Wen and the members of the Xuanwen Club didn’t mind, he would still be categorized as an anomaly among the human race.</p>
<p>However, Gu Dian didn’t seem to mind this as he continued, “Most importantly, the dimension also needs a non-human person like me to work for them. That’s why I became Faceless Buddha of Fireworks Lane.”</p>
<p>“Dimension?” Zhou Wen’s body trembled.</p>
<p>If Gu Dian were to surrender to the dimension, how would he deal with him when Zhou Wen fought the dimension in the future?</p>
<p>“There’s something here. Take a look. Destroy it after you’re done. If there’s nothing else, don’t come again.” Gu Dian took out a package and handed it to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“See for yourself when you return.” With that said, Gu Dian got up and walked out of the yard.</p>
<p>Seeing that he was determined to see him off, Zhou Wen had no choice but to put away the package and get up to walk out of the yard with Gu Dian.</p>
<p>“Ah Cai, you really don’t have to be afraid. I’ll definitely save you.” Hui Wan still didn’t believe that Ah Cai had stayed here willingly.</p>
<p>Ah Cai still wanted to explain, but Gu Dian grabbed Hui Wan’s head and pulled him in front of him.</p>
<p>“Come on, I’m not afraid of you. I’m saving Ah Cai.” Hui Wan punched and kicked in the air, but his tiny arms and legs couldn’t touch Gu Dian.</p>
<p>“Come again when you have the ability to save her.” Gu Dian casually threw Hui Wan to the ground. Hui Wan’s buttocks nearly split open as he cried out in pain.</p>
<p>Then, Gu Dian took Ah Cai back to the yard and closed the door. Hui Wan gritted his teeth and got up, but he didn’t chase after them again. He also didn’t clamor to save Ah Cai.</p>
<p>“Let’s go back.” Zhou Wen left Fireworks Lane with Hui Wan. This time, Hui Wan didn’t insist on staying.</p>
<p>When they passed by Fireworks Lane, everyone consciously made way for them.</p>
<p>Not long after leaving, Hui Wan suddenly asked Zhou Wen seriously, “Faceless Buddha is very polite to you. You must be very powerful, right?”</p>
<p>“So-so. It’s passable,” Zhou Wen said with a shrug.</p>
<p>“Who’s stronger between you and Faceless Buddha?” Hui Wan asked again.</p>
<p>“We’ve never competed, so I don’t know. Why are you asking?” Zhou Wen looked at Hui Wan in surprise.</p>
<p>“I want to defeat Faceless Buddha. No one in the Hui family is stronger than him. I want you to teach me. Tell me whatever conditions you have; I’ll meet them as long as I can.” Hui Wan’s expression was very serious.</p>
<p>“I don’t lack money,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>Hui Wan immediately panicked and hurriedly said, “Do you have any Companion Beasts or Mythical Serums you want? I can think of a way to help you obtain them.”</p>
<p>“Can you obtain such a Companion Beast? If you can, I’ll teach you.” Zhou Wen summoned Banana Fairy.</p>
<p>Hui Wan watched as Banana Fairy’s beautiful figure gradually vanished in front of him. He couldn’t help but widen his eyes. A humanoid Terror-grade Companion Beast?</p>
<p>“How is that? Do you still want to learn from me?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>Hui Wan lowered his head, but he quickly looked up and said with a serious expression, “I can work for you. I’m still very young. I can’t obtain such a Companion Beast now, but I’ll definitely be able to obtain it in ten or twenty years. In those ten years… No… twenty years… I can work for you…”</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen’s expression remain unchanged, Hui Wan continued guiltily, “What about… 30 years…”</p>
<p>“Would you be willing to work for me your entire life?” Zhou Wen asked Hui Wan with a smile.</p>
<p>Hui Wan’s body trembled, but his gaze quickly turned firm. He looked at Zhou Wen and said, “If you can promise to help me defeat Faceless Buddha, I will work for you for the rest of my life.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Hui Wan in surprise and asked, “Is Ah Cai that important to you?”</p>
<p>“It’s not just for Ah Cai. I can’t let my family be harmed like Ah Cai. I want to have the power to protect them.. Just having money isn’t enough,” Hui Wan said.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1218'>Chapter 1218: Imparting the Qi Refinement Art</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“I can teach you, but to what extent you can learn depends on your talent and hard work. It’s not guaranteed that you can defeat Faceless Buddha,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I understand. In that case, are you willing to teach me?” Hui Wan said happily.</p>
<p>“I can teach you, but I don’t need you to work for me forever. I just need you to help me do three things,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“What are they?” Hui Wan hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“I haven’t thought of them yet. I’ll tell you when I think of them.” Zhou Wen didn’t plan on getting Hui Wan to help him. He had only made a passing remark.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Hui Wan was very serious. “I’ll do anything it takes, as long as it’s moral and doesn’t harm my family or friends. Even if I have to give up everything, I will definitely do the three things you want.”</p>
<p>“That’s good.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>“When are you going to teach me?” Hui Wan pressed anxiously.</p>
<p>“What do you want to learn?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>This question stumped Hui Wan. Although his knowledge far exceeded his peers, he didn’t know what he should learn to defeat Faceless Buddha.</p>
<p>“Of course I want to learn what you’re best at. I want to have the strength to defeat Faceless Buddha.” Hui Wan thought for a moment and said, “Does the Essence Energy Art you cultivate require a special physique? I don’t have a special physique, but I can use the Mythical Serum to change my physique.”</p>
<p>“Let me take a look,” Zhou Wen said as he grabbed Hui Wan’s hand and injected his Essence Energy into his body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used the Demon God Body. He didn’t need to transform into Hui Wan’s appearance. All he needed to do was understand his body.</p>
<p>Moments later, Zhou Wen dispelled his Demon God Body and said to Hui Wan, “Your body really doesn’t have any special physiques. I can give you two choices. Both of these Essence Energy Arts suit you. The first choice is to cultivate the Qi Refinement Art. This Essence Energy Art is very difficult to cultivate. Not only do you need massive amounts of resources, but you also need perceptivity and hard work. If you cultivate it well, you can become a first-rate expert or a top expert in the future. If you don’t cultivate it well, as long as you have large amounts of resources, you can barely become a third-rate expert. Everything depends on your effort and hard work. There’s also another one called the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. This Essence Energy Art requires fewer resources than the Qi Refinement Art, but it has extremely high requirements for one’s talent and perceptivity. If you can succeed, you might soar to the sky. If you can’t, you won’t even be considered a third-rate expert. It will be difficult for you to achieve anything in this lifetime. Which one do you choose?”</p>
<p>Hui Wan thought for a while and quickly made a choice. “Qi Refinement Art.”</p>
<p>“Why did you choose the Qi Refinement Art?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. Typically, geniuses who were confident in themselves would choose the latter.</p>
<p>Hui Wan answered, “Talent is something that can’t be controlled. I don’t like things that can’t be controlled, so I want to cultivate an Essence Energy Art that’s within my control.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll teach you the Qi Refinement Art.” Upon hearing Hui Wan’s words, Zhou Wen began to like this child. He indeed had the mind and qualities that were rare in ordinary children.</p>
<p>Although his cultivation talent might not be top-notch, as long as he could maintain such a mindset and with the Hui family’s immense capital, constantly cultivating the Essence Energy Arts would lead to a certain level of achievements in the future.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately taught the Qi Refinement Art to Hui Wan. Hui Wan was really smart. His memory was excellent—his photographic memory was just a basic trait of his.</p>
<p>“Can the Qi Refinement Art really make me an expert who can defeat Faceless Buddha?” After Hui Wan memorized the Qi Refinement Art that Zhou Wen had imparted to him, he couldn’t help but have some doubts.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Hui Wan was doubting Zhou Wen. He only wanted him to demonstrate the might of the Qi Refinement Art so that he could have some confidence.</p>
<p>“I’ve said it before. Whether you can defeat Faceless Buddha depends on your effort and hard work. The more effort you put in, the greater your future achievements will be. The more likely it is to defeat Faceless Buddha.” Zhou Wen had no intention of demonstrating its prowess.</p>
<p>“Then can you use the Qi Refinement Art to defeat Faceless Buddha?” Hui Wan asked again.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>Hui Wan was slightly disappointed, but not knowing was better than definitely not being able to defeat him.</p>
<p>As the two of them spoke, they had already walked out of Fireworks Lane. Not long after they walked out, they were surrounded by a group of soldiers. One of them was a well-dressed man with glasses. He walked in front of Zhou Wen and stared at him. “Who are you? Why did you take Young Master to Fireworks Lane?”</p>
<p>“Secretary Liu, this is the coach I hired. Arrange for him to stay in my yard,” Hui Wan said.</p>
<p>When Secretary Liu heard Hui Wan’s words, he couldn’t help but frown slightly. “Young Master, you already have many coaches. If you still want to learn something new, I can hire the best experts in the Federation for you. You can’t casually bring someone of unknown origins into the residence. This is against the rules. Otherwise, we won’t be able to answer to the president.”</p>
<p>“I’ll explain this matter to my father myself,” Hui Wan said as he pulled Zhou Wen’s hand and walked forward. He knew that Liu Yujin was a very strict person. He maintained a suspicious attitude towards everything. In his eyes, anyone was either a criminal or a suspect.</p>
<p>It wasn’t only Zhou Wen; even if the family heads of the six families came, Liu Yujin would treat them as suspects. As far as Hui Wan could remember, he had never seen any changes in Liu Yujin’s ice-cold face.</p>
<p>Secretary Liu called for an officer and whispered a few words into his ear. Then, he led his men and followed. Instead of calling it protection, it was more like a tight surveillance.</p>
<p>“May I know how to address you?” Secretary Liu walked beside Zhou Wen and asked.</p>
<p>Liu Yujin didn’t underestimate Zhou Wen because of his young age, but he was familiar with the young geniuses from all over the Federation.</p>
<p>He compared Zhou Wen’s appearance to similar-aged experts of the Federation and even overseas and realized that he was momentarily unsure of Zhou Wen’s identity.</p>
<p>It was no wonder Liu Yujin didn’t know Zhou Wen. Liu Yujin knew Zhou Wen’s name and had even seen his old photo. However, the photos he had seen were of An Jing’s impersonation of Zhou Wen. There was already a difference in their temperaments. Furthermore, in the past five years of impersonating Zhou Wen, An Jing had been guarding Chess Mountain and had chosen to keep a low profile. Therefore, Zhou Wen’s name had been silent for too long.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>Liu Yujin was slightly taken aback when he heard that. After carefully sizing up Zhou Wen, he frowned and said, “You are Zhou Wen from Luoyang?”</p>
<p>He was very confident in his memory. Although he had only seen the Zhou Wen in the photo and the Zhou Wen in the photo was somewhat similar to the Zhou Wen in front of him, he still felt that they weren’t the same person.</p>
<p>“I attended school in Luoyang and stayed for quite some time,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“Are you and Overseer An family?” Liu Yujin asked again.</p>
<p>“No, not really..” Zhou Wen’s answer left Liu Yujin slightly taken aback as he sized up Zhou Wen again in surprise.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1219'>Chapter 1219: I’m Not Good At Movement Techniques</h3>
<p>Under Liu Yujin’s “escort,” Zhou Wen arrived in front of a mansion again. However, Hui Wan had taken the side door previously; this time, they were taking the main entrance.</p>
<p>This was the Hui family’s private residence, not Hui Haifeng’s office.</p>
<p>However, the area it covered was still rather sizable. After passing through the entrance, the first thing he saw was a large empty space. It was like a field with many soldiers training.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at the soldiers who were practicing and realized that they were practicing a movement technique that looked familiar.</p>
<p>Isn’t this Hui Haifeng’s Double True movement technique? Zhou Wen quickly recalled.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen watch the soldiers practice their movement techniques, Hui Wan said proudly, “Zhou Wen, what do you think of the movement technique?”</p>
<p>“It’s average,” Zhou Wen said casually.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had partial responsibility for naming the Double True movement technique. Hui Haifeng also said that half of the movement technique was Zhou Wen’s. He was embarrassed to praise the potency of the movement technique as it would be akin to praising himself.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this movement technique was only considered average to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Hui Wan originally wanted to say that this movement technique was created by his father, but when he heard Zhou Wen say that, the latter half of the sentence was stuck in his throat as his face flushed red.</p>
<p>Liu Yujin couldn’t accept what he was hearing. He said coldly, “The Double True movement technique originated from the Hui family, but it’s used by many families in the Federation’s four districts. It’s a compulsory movement technique for the military. It has been verified by countless soldiers in numerous battles. Even an army as strong as Luoyang’s Sunset Army practices the Double True movement technique on a large scale. Sir, you said that this movement technique is average. I believe you possess a better movement technique than the Double True movement technique?”</p>
<p>Hui Wan also looked at Zhou Wen. Although he believed that Zhou Wen was very strong, his father was also his pride.</p>
<p>“I’m not good at movement techniques.” Zhou Wen didn’t wish to argue with them, nor was there a need to. Doing so would be no different from having his left hand fight his right.</p>
<p>It was to Zhou Wen’s surprise that the Double True movement technique was widely used in the military.</p>
<p>He had to admit that Hui Haifeng was a genius. Unfortunately, he had spent most of his energy on research and later became president. Otherwise, with his talent, his cultivation level would have been top-notch.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen admit defeat, Liu Yujin didn’t say anything else.</p>
<p>Hui Wan was somewhat disappointed. He had mixed feelings. Although he didn’t wish for his father’s reputation to be damaged, he also hoped that Zhou Wen would be as strong as possible. As long as that was the case, the value of what he learned from Zhou Wen would be higher.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen admitting that his movement technique was lacking, Hui Wan naturally wasn’t happy.</p>
<p>“Young Master, His Excellency will be back soon. You and Mr. Zhou can wait in the living room for the time being.” Liu Yujin stopped Hui Wan from taking Zhou Wen to the backyard.</p>
<p>Hui Wan also knew that this matter needed Hui Haifeng’s permission. After some thought, he nodded in agreement and entered the living room with Zhou Wen as they waited for Hui Haifeng’s return.</p>
<p>“May I know which aspect you are good at? What would you be teaching Young Master?” Liu Yujin asked again after instructing someone to pour Zhou Wen some tea.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought seriously for a moment before answering, “I’m best at life-preservation. However, I can’t teach this ability to others. Even if I teach it, they won’t be able to learn it. Therefore, I only plan on teaching Hui Wan Essence Energy Arts.”</p>
<p>“Life-preservation?” Liu Yujin was slightly taken aback. When he heard that Zhou Wen was going to teach Hui Wan an Essence Energy Art, he couldn’t control his expression. He said seriously, “Essence Energy Arts are the foundation of everything. How can one randomly learn one? Even the scions of the six families have to go through repeated selections to find the most suitable Essence Energy Art for their cultivation. Is your Essence Energy Art better than the Essence Energy Arts of the six families?”</p>
<p>“I can’t say it’s better for sure. The quality of an Essence Energy Art depends mainly on a cultivator’s talent and ability,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Liu Yujin couldn’t help but sneer; he felt that Zhou Wen was resembling a charlatan.</p>
<p>Just as Liu Yujin was about to say something, he saw someone enter. It was none other than Hui Haifeng, who was dressed in formal attire.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, this…” Liu Yujin was just about to warn Hui Haifeng that Zhou Wen was very problematic.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, when Hui Haifeng saw Zhou Wen, he went over and punched him in the chest. “Why didn’t you inform me before coming to Holy City? You even abducted Little Wan. What’s the meaning of this? Are you jealous that I have a son? If you’re jealous, say it. I’ll get Little Wan to be your godson to prevent you from getting jealous.”</p>
<p>“It’s best if you keep him for yourself. I can’t afford handling someone like him,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency…” Liu Yujin was somewhat surprised. From Hui Haifeng’s expression, he seemed to be certain that this was the real Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng didn’t wait for Liu Yujin to finish before introducing, “Yujin, this is my junior, Zhou Wen. Make a pass for him so that he can enter and leave freely to avoid trouble in the future.”</p>
<p>With that said, Hui Haifeng said to Zhou Wen, “Zhou Wen, I don’t care if you want it or not. Anyway, Little Wan is your nephew. Do as you see fit and teach him something. Let me think about it. Let’s start with movement techniques…”</p>
<p>“Dad…” Hui Wan’s expression was odd as though he wanted to say something.</p>
<p>“Little Wan, what are you waiting for? Hurry up and give your Uncle Zhou your new year’s greetings. A red packet is definitely in order,” Hui Haifeng said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you shameless? It’s only the middle of the year, alright? New year’s greetings? Isn’t that too early?” Zhou Wen was at a loss whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>“I don’t care. In any case, you have to teach him. I only have this one son. Do as you deem fit.” Hui Haifeng sat down and poured himself a cup of tea, ignoring Zhou Wen. He looked as though he was a scoundrel and that he was proud to have a son.</p>
<p>“Dad… He said that he’s not good at movement techniques…” Hui Wan found an opportunity and whispered.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng nearly spat out the mouthful of tea he had just drunk when he heard that. “He isn’t good at movement techniques? If his movement technique isn’t good, is there anyone on Earth who has good movement techniques? He’s partially responsible for naming the Double True movement technique. Part of this movement technique was imitating him. Do you think his movement technique isn’t good?”</p>
<p>Standing beside them, Liu Yujin was dumbfounded. The Double True movement technique that Hui Haifeng had created had spread throughout the various military circles of the Federation. Even many people overseas were learning it, but it was actually an imitation of Zhou Wen’s movement technique.</p>
<p>“I didn’t say so. He said it himself,” Hui Wan waved his hand and pointed at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What’s the point of lying to a child? This won’t do; my son’s young heart has suffered a heavy blow. This will leave an indelible shadow in his life. You have to pay…” Hui Haifeng looked like he was about to extort Zhou Wen’s last coin.</p>
<p>“I’ve already taught your son an Essence Energy Art. Is that enough compensation?” Zhou Wen said with a bitter expression.</p>
<p>“That’s more like it.” Hui Haifeng pressed Hui Wan’s head and asked, “Cultivate the Essence Energy Art your Uncle Zhou taught you. You don’t have to cultivate other Essence Energy Arts in the future.”</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, we spent so much effort to obtain the Essence Energy Art from the Family Clan of Gods and created the corresponding Mythical Serum…” Liu Yujin hurriedly reminded Hui Haifeng.</p>
<p>“With my junior’s Essence Energy Art, what do you need that crap for?” Hui Haifeng’s words left Liu Yujin’s mouth agape.</p>
<p>That wasn’t what Hui Haifeng had said in the past. The crap he was talking about was a top Essence Energy Art he had paid a huge price to obtain from the Family Clan of Gods.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to allow Hui Wan to cultivate it, he had specially created a Mythical Serum that could bestow a special physique on him. The price was unimaginable.</p>
<p>Now, without even knowing what Essence Energy Art Zhou Wen had imparted, Hui Haifeng had described it as crap. This change was too surprising.</p>
<p>“Junior, you can’t only teach him Essence Energy Arts, right? You have to teach him your movement techniques. I only have one son and you only have one nephew. You have to make sure he stays alive…” Hui Haifeng continued trying to squeeze Zhou Wen dry.</p>

<p>In a chamber, there was only Zhou Wen and Hui Haifeng.</p>
<p>“Where have you been for the past five years?” Hui Haifeng asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“How did you know that I wasn’t the one at Chess Mountain?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise. For Hui Haifeng to accurately say five years was clearly not a wild guess.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng rolled his eyes. “Do you think I don’t know your character? Just a glance at a photo was sufficient for me to tell that it wasn’t you.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” Zhou Wen said helplessly. “I was trapped by Teacher. It was no different from being dead. I only came out after five years.”</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng nodded. “I roughly guessed it. You are Human Sovereign, right? The dimension wouldn’t let your killing of Di Tian rest. If you hadn’t died, the past five years wouldn’t have been so peaceful. However, with Teacher’s personality, he probably wouldn’t just let you die for five years. There must be some scheme, right?”</p>
<p>“Sort of. Time passed very slowly in the place where I was trapped. It felt like more than a hundred years had passed,” Zhou Wen said</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng said jealously, “Teacher really dotes on you the most. Five years for a hundred years. If I had so much time, I might have even developed a Calamity-grade dimensional serum.”</p>
<p>“It’s only time for the mind. Your body can’t even move. What can you research?” Zhou Wen was somewhat speechless.</p>
<p>“That’s true.” Hui Haifeng chuckled.</p>
<p>“In just five years, you became the Federation President. Impressive,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“It’s considered a multifaceted coincidence. On the one hand, it’s because of my research. Also, didn’t Teacher give us some things before he went to the dimension? Those things were very helpful to me.” Hui Haifeng paused for a moment before continuing, “However, as the president, it’s all in name with no actual power. In fact, most of the Federation’s power is in the hands of the League of Guardians and the six families. As the president, I can’t even completely control Holy City.”</p>
<p>“Then why are you still the president?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Why not? Although I’m only a figurehead, I’m already in this position. I can slowly change some things and think of ways to realize my dreams. Just like an actor, only by appearing on stage can you let others see your acting skills and infect others with your emotions. If I were to only stand offstage, no matter how good my acting skills were or how much I fantasized, I wouldn’t be able to affect anyone,” Hui Haifeng said.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Zhou Wen looked at Hui Haifeng.</p>
<p>“I want to make sure that there are no more orphans in this world,” Hui Haifeng said seriously. “You might find it ridiculous, and I know that this is almost an impossible goal, but I just want to give it a try.”</p>
<p>“It’s not funny at all.” Zhou Wen was somewhat moved. Although he didn’t have such lofty goals, it didn’t stop him from admiring such a person.</p>
<p>“Of course, I also want to see what it’s like to stand at the peak of the world,” Hui Haifeng chuckled and continued.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng’s change in attitude left Zhou Wen at a loss whether to laugh or cry. “Now that you’ve almost done it, how does it feel to be president?”</p>
<p>“Not good at all. There’s many things I wish to do but can’t.” Hui Haifeng shook his head, clearly not wanting to say too much.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t ask further. This wasn’t his specialty. He couldn’t help Hui Haifeng with anything, so asking was useless.</p>
<p>“What’s going on between you and Gu Dian?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Some fellows don’t wish for me to get too close to Gu Dian, or rather, they don’t wish for me to get too close to the underground market, so this happened,” Hui Haifeng said vaguely, but Zhou Wen still understood.</p>
<p>The two of them chatted about some matters, but they didn’t chat for long. Hui Haifeng was just too busy. Soon, he had to leave to handle some matters.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng got Zhou Wen to stay and wait for him to come back for dinner.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen returned to the temporary room Hui Haifeng had arranged for him. He took out his phone and realized that he had successfully downloaded the Venusian instance dungeon. It took much less time than he had imagined.</p>
<p>After tapping open the Venusian instance dungeon, the blood-colored avatar quickly appeared on the top platform of the hemispherical metal building. It was likely the entrance to the metal building, but it didn’t open.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that such an entrance that couldn’t be opened needed a special method to enter.</p>
<p>Using Human Sovereign’s power, he attempted to forcefully break through the entrance, but he failed. The metal building was unimaginably hard. Even a Terror-grade power couldn’t damage it.</p>
<p>He tried using Truth Listener and Eyes of Penetration, but he failed to see what was happening inside the metal building.</p>
<p>After carving out Clown Mask, Zhou Wen used teleportation to enter. He succeeded. The scene in front of him changed as the blood-colored avatar found itself inside the hemispherical metal building.</p>
<p>However, the scene he saw left him slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>Beneath the entrance was a hexagonal room. In the middle of the room stood a metal statue that was four to five meters tall.</p>
<p>The metal statue was bright silver in color and looked very strange. It was like a huge human wearing modern metal armor. However, he was certain that there was no human inside. It was a pure metal statue.</p>
<p>In his left hand, he was actually holding a weapon. No matter how he looked at it, the weapon looked like a submachine gun but it looked more technologically advanced. The body of the gun was also bright silver metal.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was planning what to do with the strange metal statue, its eyes suddenly lit up with a golden glow.</p>
<p>Click! Click!</p>
<p>Following that, Zhou Wen saw the spear in the metal statue’s hand spew fire at the blood-colored avatar. Large amounts of metal bullets spewed out at an unbelievable speed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar and teleported to the back of the metal statue. He slashed down with the Asura Saber in his hand, splitting the metal statue into two.</p>
<p>‘Killed Mythical creature, Metal Guard. Discovered Dimensional Crystal.’</p>
<p>A Strength Crystal dropped. Before Zhou Wen could pick it up, a door appeared on each of the six walls of the hexagonal room. A large number of Metal Guards rushed in with guns in hand.</p>
<p>At the same time, a large number of bullets shot from all directions. Their firepower covered the entire room, leaving almost no room for dodging.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was an expert who could teleport after all. However, he didn’t choose to teleport. He underwent Terror transformation and allowed the bullets to hit him. They passed through his body as though his body was an illusion. The bullets couldn’t injure him at all.</p>
<p>The bullets hit the wall and many of them hit the Metal Guards, but they quickly melted into the walls or the Metal Guards. They didn’t harm themselves.</p>
<p>If one isn’t at the Terror grade, a Mythical human would probably have been killed instantly. This is just the beginning. This dungeon is interesting.. Zhou Wen now wanted to know what was deep inside the dungeon.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1221'>Chapter 1221: Golden Gun</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>The Metal Guards that rushed out of the six doors came wave after wave. Zhou Wen slashed out and large swaths of Metal Guards were killed. The tinkling sounds of dimensional crystals dropping could be heard.</p>
<p>Among them was a silver metal Companion Egg. Zhou Wen picked it up.</p>
<p>Metal Guard: Mythical</p>
<p>Life Providence: Metal Life</p>
<p>Life Soul: Metal Armor</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Bullet Storm</p>
<p>Strength: 78</p>
<p>Speed: 71</p>
<p>Constitution: 80</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 67</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Precision Shooting, Armor-Piercing Bullets, Crazy Sweep</p>
<p>Companion Form: Metal Submachine Gun</p>
<p>Zhou Wen attempted to summon it in the form of a submachine gun. The Metal Guard transformed into a bright silver submachine gun that was the same as the ones in his opponents’ hands.</p>
<p>He pulled the trigger at the Metal Guard that was rushing over. Flames spewed out, and under the continuous recoil, bullets shot out one after another, hitting a Metal Guard, riddling his body with holes and turning him into a hornet’s nest.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>However, the Metal Guard’s injuries quickly recovered. The metal bullets were completely useless against him.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it’s impossible to use the Metal Guard to kill the other Metal Guards. I can only use it elsewhere in the future. Zhou Wen needed to continue using the Asura Saber to kill the Metal Guards that rushed in.</p>
<p>Finally after killing more than a hundred Metal Guards, no new Metal Guards poured in. Zhou Wen wanted to walk through the six doors.</p>
<p>However, just as he approached the door, his body was repelled by a force. It was as though an invisible force was blocking the door, preventing him from passing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried using teleportation again, but he was similarly unable to teleport over. Even spatial teleportation was blocked by some force.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was wondering how he could enter, an alarm sounded above one of the doors.</p>
<p>Accompanying the shrill alarm, a figure walked out of the door.</p>
<p>It was also a metal lifeform, but this fellow was more than ten meters tall. His entire body was gold in color and he held a golden revolver in each hand. His body was burning with golden flames.</p>
<p>After coming out, he began firing at the blood-colored avatar crazily. Bullets with golden beams rained down on the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen teleported behind the golden guard and slashed at its head.</p>
<p>However, the golden guard’s joints spewed out golden flames that quickly propelled his body, allowing him to dodge Zhou Wen’s strike.</p>
<p>A Terror-grade creature appeared so quickly? Zhou Wen’s eyes flashed as his saber continued accelerating in midair. With Transcendent Flying Immortal, he caught up to the golden guard and split its head into two.</p>
<p>Half of the golden guard’s head was sliced off, revealing a large number of metal components—but it didn’t immediately die.</p>
<p>The Asura Saber in Zhou Wen’s hand slashed repeatedly. As he dodged the twin golden guns’ firing, he diced up his adversary’s body into several pieces, revealing a golden energy source in his chest.</p>
<p>After destroying the golden energy source with one strike, the golden guard finally collapsed.</p>
<p>‘Killed Terror-grade creature, Golden Battle God Mark I. Discovered Dimensional Crystal.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen picked it up and realized that it was an 89-Speed Crystal. He hurriedly picked it up and absorbed it.</p>
<p>Before he could finish absorbing it, he heard another alarm. Another Golden Battle God walked out from another door. He was very similar to the Golden Battle God Mark I from before, but the golden guns in his hand were somewhat different.</p>
<p>Another Terror-grade! Zhou Wen was overjoyed. He was just worrying about finding a place to grind a large number of Terror creatures. The Venusian dungeon was an answer to his dreams.</p>
<p>The Golden Battle God here had powerful offensive strength and extremely strong defense. Its speed wasn’t slow either. It was considered a very powerful Terror-grade dimensional creature.</p>
<p>However, in front of Zhou Wen who was good at teleportation and had powerful offensive strength, these Golden Battle Gods were basically lambs to be slaughtered.</p>
<p>The second Golden Battle God didn’t last long before being slain under Zhou Wen’s blade.</p>
<p>‘Killed Terror-grade creature, Golden Battle God Mark II.’</p>
<p>Unfortunately, nothing dropped this time, leaving Zhou Wen somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the third Golden Battle God quickly appeared. These Golden Battle Gods looked similar. They couldn’t touch Zhou Wen at all before being killed.</p>
<p>This time, the Golden Battle God Mark III dropped another dimensional crystal, allowing Zhou Wen’s four stats to successfully reach 81 points, but there were no signs of him advancing to the Terror grade.</p>
<p>One Golden Battle God after another was killed by Zhou Wen. When the Golden Battle God that walked out of the sixth door was killed by Zhou Wen, a Companion Egg dropped.</p>
<p>The Companion Egg was made of gold. It was burning with golden flames and there were magma-like cracks that lined the surface of the Companion Egg. It looked extremely cool.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted as he hurriedly picked up the Companion Egg and chose to hatch it.</p>
<p>Golden Battle God Mark VI: Terror grade.</p>
<p>Life Providence: Metal Life</p>
<p>Life Soul: Metal Armor</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Infinite Bullets</p>
<p>Terror transformation: Golden Battle God</p>
<p>Strength: 97</p>
<p>Speed: 94</p>
<p>Constitution: 98</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 98</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Explosive Bullets, Crazy Sweep, Rapid Fire</p>
<p>Companion Form: Golden Gun Mark VI</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his hand and beckoned. A golden revolver appeared in his hand. It looked gorgeous and beautiful, identical to the one in the Golden Battle God Mark VI’s hand. However, the model was clearly much smaller, making it suitable for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to test the might of the Golden Gun, but the Golden Battle Gods didn’t continue appearing. The six doors fell silent as though there were only six Golden Battle Gods.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was sizing up the doors, the alarm on the six doors suddenly sounded. The ear-piercing sound made him nervous.</p>
<p>What the hell will it be this time? Just as Zhou Wen was thinking, he suddenly heard a gunshot.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could react, a hole in the blood-colored avatar’s head blasted open. Its head exploded and the phone screen went black.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Thankfully, I’m in-game. Zhou Wen secretly rejoiced that he hadn’t entered this dungeon in real life. The person who had killed him with a bullet was most likely a Calamity-grade creature.</p>
<p>He wanted to drip his blood into the Venus instance dungeon again, but he was notified by the system that the instance dungeon could only be reopened after 24 hours.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng hadn’t returned, so Zhou Wen had nothing to do. He took out the package Gu Dian had given him.</p>
<p>Opening the package, he saw a set of clothes inside.</p>
<p>The clothes were naturally not the run-of-the-mill clothes, but a high-tech combat uniform. This combat uniform was typically used for ordinary soldiers. It was basically useless for humans at Zhou Wen’s level.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that Gu Dian wasn’t the kind of person who would gift clothes, so he scanned the combat uniform and quickly found a hidden memory card in the first-aid kit that came with it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1222'>Chapter 1222: Live Broadcast of the Cube Battle</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>He inserted the memory card into his phone and read the contents. After he was done, Zhou Wen’s expression turned solemn.</p>
<p>The content was very simple. There were no videos or pictures. There was only some short text.</p>
<p>The Cube’s activation this time wasn’t initiated by the dimension? Zhou Wen frowned in thought.</p>
<p>According to Gu Dian’s intelligence, the dimension couldn’t completely control the Cube’s operations. Venus’s appearance was an operation initiated by the Cube.</p>
<p>According to Gu Dian’s analysis, the dimension seemed bent on clearing the dimensional zone on Venus first. Furthermore, it was secretly pushing for this to happen. The League of Guardians had already taken action. Many Guardians that had contracted humans were secretly preparing for battle and buying many items they needed.</p>
<p>The dimension is determined to clear the dimensional zone on Venus? What do they want from Venus’s dimensional zone? Zhou Wen’s expression turned even more solemn after he was done reading.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen destroyed the memory card, not daring to leave any traces of it. Otherwise, it might be restored by some special ability.</p>
<p>I naturally can’t let the dimension obtain what they want. Since they can’t interfere with the operation of the Cube, that makes things simpler. I’ll first explore Venus and might be able to succeed before them. Zhou Wen wanted to enter the dungeon, but the countdown wasn’t up.</p>
<p>When Hui Haifeng returned, the two of them had a meal together. Hui Wan was beside them, chatting as they ate. After the meal, Hui Haifeng left again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stayed for half a day and taught Hui Wan the key to cultivating the Qi Refinement Art before letting him practice it himself.</p>
<p>Little could go wrong with an Essence Energy Art like the Qi Refinement Art. As long as he had Essence Energy Crystals, there wouldn’t be too many problems with his cultivation.</p>
<p>After leaving the Hui residence, Zhou Wen repeatedly teleported all the way back to Luoyang, hoping to reach his destination before the countdown ended.</p>
<p>However, Earth had suffered drastic anomalies, so it took longer to return to Luoyang than Zhou Wen had expected. By the time he returned, the huge metal building had already surfaced.</p>
<p>Only the hemispherical metal part was exposed above the magma. No one knew how deep it went.</p>
<p>Just as the Venusian instance dungeon appeared, the golden person from before came in front of the metal building again. He landed on the platform at the top of the hemispherical building without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen had already arrived at a place with a phone signal and could watch the live broadcast on his phone.</p>
<p>I teleported in, whereas that golden person doesn’t look like he knows spatial skills. How is he going to enter? As Zhou Wen was pondering, he saw the golden person slice off a piece of gold from his body and place it on the platform.</p>
<p>After the piece of gold touched the platform, it seemed to sink like it had dropped into a swamp and was quickly devoured by it.</p>
<p>As the gold was devoured, the platform automatically opened.</p>
<p>The golden person immediately rushed over. As he entered the hemispherical building, the platform’s entrance automatically closed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that he wouldn’t be able to see anything, but to his surprise, the scene of the Cube changed to the interior of the building. He could see the golden person standing inside the hemispherical building.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen had encountered in-game, there was a Metal Guard inside the building. After seeing the golden person, he immediately raised his metal submachine gun and shot at him.</p>
<p>The golden person extended a palm that emitted golden light, transforming into a light shield in front of him. All the bullets that struck the light shield were blocked.</p>
<p>When the Metal Guard stopped shooting, the golden person’s figure blinked and appeared in front of him. He blasted the Metal Guard’s body apart with a punch, turning it into fragments.</p>
<p>Following that, the situation was identical to Zhou Wen’s. The six doors opened as hordes of Metal Guards rushed out and shot at the golden person from different directions.</p>
<p>The ferocious firepower terrified the spectating humans. It was virtually impossible to dodge.</p>
<p>The golden person’s light shield couldn’t block all the bullets from every direction. In the next second, the golden person’s body turned translucent like a visible Spirit Body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he saw the bullet pass through the golden person’s body without injuring him at all. This was likely a Terror transformation.</p>
<p>However, after a Terror transformation, he should be completely invisible. Why was he still visible?</p>
<p>Could it be that his Terror transformation is a relatively rare type? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that something was amiss. I get it. It’s not that the Terror transformation of the golden person is rare, but the Cube deliberately allows ordinary creatures to see the golden person despite the Terror transformation.</p>
<p>The subsequent battle was a one-sided massacre. The Terror-form golden person slaughtered Mythical Metal Guards like livestock. He didn’t even pick up the dimensional crystals that fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Many of the spectating humans widened their eyes as they looked at the shimmering dimensional crystals on the ground. They wished they could help the golden person pick them up.</p>
<p>“He’s really not picking them up. They are all Mythical dimensional crystals!”</p>
<p>“A Companion Egg… A Companion Egg dropped… He’s still not picking it up…”</p>
<p>The golden person quickly finished off all the Metal Guards. Following that, a familiar scene appeared. The alarm sounded as the Golden Battle God Mark I appeared.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The Golden Battle God raised a golden revolver and shot a bullet at the golden person.</p>
<p>The golden person clearly didn’t have Zhou Wen’s teleportation ability. The bullet was too fast, so he couldn’t shoot and deflect it. He condensed a golden shield again, hoping to block the Golden Battle God’s bullet.</p>
<p>The bullet struck the light shield, but it failed to penetrate it. Instead, the bullet shattered.</p>
<p>However, in the next moment, something shocking happened. The shattered bullet turned into a mist of white frost. The frost mist froze whatever it touched.</p>
<p>First was the light shield, then the golden person’s body. Moments later, it was covered in thick frost.</p>
<p>Although the golden person wasn’t really frozen, its mobility was severely affected and its speed slowed down significantly.</p>
<p>The Golden Battle God fired both his guns at the same time, and bullets hit the golden person. Every bullet strengthened the freezing effect on the golden person.</p>
<p>Under a barrage of firing, the golden person’s body exploded, turning into ice shards and gold.</p>
<p>I never expected the Golden Battle God to have such a move! Zhou Wen was alarmed because he had attacked too quickly. The Golden Battle God hadn’t had the chance to use his full strength and was easily dispatched.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen realized that it wasn’t that the Golden Battle God was weak, but that he was too fast.</p>
<p>Once the golden person died, the Cube’s screen returned to its previous point of view, returning to a zoomed out shot of Venus.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen understood that the Cube would broadcast the battle in the dungeon.</p>
<p>Since the Cube isn’t controlled by the dimension, what’s its goal? Zhou Wen frowned in thought.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1223'>Chapter 1223: A Way to Take Advantage</h3>
<p>Everyone was discussing the death of the golden person and the terror of the Golden Battle God. Zhou Wen thought more about it.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi was forced to leave Earth not because she entered the dimension. She didn’t even leave the Solar System. Then, if she said that leaving Earth would be dangerous, where does the danger come from? Zhou Wen thought further.</p>
<p>There’s a Companion Egg in the Moon. Now that Venus has produced such a dimensional zone, could the danger they mentioned be referring to this? Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss when he thought about it. There had to be something he didn’t know, but he couldn’t figure it out from speculation. It made him feel terrible.</p>
<p>I’ll just ignore it. No matter what, I can’t let the dimension succeed. I have to think of a way to obtain the item in the Venusian instance dungeon. Zhou Wen returned to Luoyang as everyone discussed the matter.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, what do you think is going on with the dimensional zone on Venus? Why was it live-streamed by the Cube?” Li Xuan came to Zhou Wen and raised the matter.</p>
<p>“How would I know?” Zhou Wen also wanted to know why the Cube was doing this.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Cube was beyond the dimension’s control; humans knew nothing about it.</p>
<p>“I think the Cube loves to watch people fight to the death. It definitely doesn’t have any good intentions for coming out with a Venusian dimensional zone. Could it be that it wants to lure humans to explore Venus and watch the thrill of humans being killed?” Li Xuan said jokingly.</p>
<p>“That’s not impossible.” Just as Zhou Wen was speaking, he suddenly saw the live broadcast stir again.</p>
<p>A human figure appeared on the platform of the hemispherical building. On careful look, it was a human covered in armor.</p>
<p>“Eh, a human actually went?” Li Xuan looked and quickly recognized him. “That’s a fellow from the League of Guardians. How did he get there?”</p>
<p>“It’s likely through the Cube,” Zhou Wen guessed.</p>
<p>As the two of them were talking, the Guardian scratched his finger and dripped a drop of blood on the platform. Then, the platform automatically opened and sucked the Guardian in.</p>
<p>After the Guardian entered, he didn’t encounter the Golden Battle God. The one who came out was still the Metal Guard.</p>
<p>When the Metal Guard shot the bullets, the Guardian released a terrifying frost power that froze the bullets in midair.</p>
<p>The Guardian was like a figure skater walking on ice as he shuttled through the Metal Guards. Wherever he passed, the Metal Guards would be frozen into ice sculptures.</p>
<p>When all the Metal Guards had turned into ice sculptures and the Guardian had retreated to a distance, the ice sculpture-like Metal Guards’ bodies suddenly shattered, turning into ice cubes.</p>
<p>Unlike the golden person, the Guardian picked up the dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs on the ground. However, before he could finish picking them up, the Golden Battle God had already rushed out of the door.</p>
<p>The bullets shot out again at terrifying speeds. The Guardian also underwent Terror transformation, but under the effects of the Cube, humans could still see a transparent figure that didn’t completely vanish.</p>
<p>He quickly moved and dodged some bullets, but his speed was clearly not as fast as the Golden Battle God’s shooting. Just as he was about to fail at dodging a few bullets, the Guardian grabbed the bullets with both hands and actually squeezed them between his fingers.</p>
<p>The bullets exploded and turned into a terrifying ice mist.</p>
<p>However, this ice mist didn’t injure the Guardian. Instead, it strengthened the Guardian’s freezing power.</p>
<p>“The League of Guardians’ idea isn’t bad. They can use ice-type Guardians to fight those strange dimensional creatures.” Li Xuan watched for a while and knew that the outcome was decided.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen knew that things weren’t that simple. Although the Guardian’s ice-elemental powers did restrain the Golden Battle God Mark I, there were a total of six Golden Battle Gods. Their bullets were different.</p>
<p>This Guardian was purely ice-type. He could restrain one type, but he would probably be at a disadvantage if he encountered others.</p>
<p>The Guardian fought bitterly for more than an hour before finally killing the Golden Battle God. Unfortunately, his luck wasn’t good. Not to mention Companion Eggs, not a single dimensional crystal dropped.</p>
<p>Soon, the Golden Battle God Mark II rushed out again and shot crazily at the Guardian.</p>
<p>The Guardian didn’t dare let his guard down. He condensed an ice wall to block the bullets.</p>
<p>The bullets struck the ice wall and immediately exploded. However, this time, it wasn’t a bullet of frost. Terrifyingly high temperature flames quickly swept through the room.</p>
<p>Such terrifying flames were the nemesis of the Guardian. His ice-elemental abilities were greatly suppressed as the situation became more and more dangerous.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the room was sealed—it was impossible for him to escape. In the end, he was burned to death in the room.</p>
<p>After that Guardian, no one entered the Venusian dimensional zone. The dragon, the black-winged angel, and skeleton monster that had previously visited Venus didn’t appear again, nor did Tsukuyomi appear again.</p>
<p>It was unknown if they were no longer interested or if they were waiting for an opportunity.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen received confirmed news that it was possible to reach the hemispherical building through the Cube.</p>
<p>However, no one dared to head over for the time being. Only Mythical creatures could survive on Venus. However, if they entered the Venusian dimensional zone, the two Terror-grade creatures before them were examples of the outcome.</p>
<p>It was easy to enter, but not so easy to come out again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Venus on the screen and suddenly had an idea.</p>
<p>In the game, one had to wait 24 hours after dying in the Venusian instance dungeon. However, in reality, there didn’t seem to be such a restriction.</p>
<p>The interval between the golden person and the Guardian wasn’t 24 hours, but there were equally many Metal Guards.</p>
<p>If he only killed the Metal Guards and the Golden Battle God before leaving the Venusian instance dungeon, he could kill large numbers of Mythical creatures and Terror-grade creatures in a short span of time. The chances of Companion Eggs and good items dropping would greatly increase.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had such thoughts, he wasn’t in a rush to take the risk. He still needed to confirm something.</p>
<p>It was an excruciating 24-hour wait before he could enter the Venusian instance dungeon again. Zhou Wen immediately entered and grinded the Metal Guards and the Golden Battle Gods inside.</p>
<p>However, this time, Zhou Wen wasn’t that lucky. He didn’t have a Golden Battle God Companion Egg drop and only obtained a skill crystal.</p>
<p>The skill crystal required 81 Constitution and 41 Fire stat. He also needed a Metal Essence Energy Art to absorb it. Zhou Wen had no choice but to give it up since he couldn’t meet the requirements.</p>
<p>When the six alarms sounded at the same time, Zhou Wen used spatial teleportation to leave the Venusian dungeon and arrive at the entrance’s platform.</p>
<p>It does work! Zhou Wen was overjoyed.</p>
<p>Following that, Zhou Wen made another attempt. He got the blood-colored avatar to drip a drop of blood on the platform and used the normal method to enter Venus.</p>
<p>After entering again, the alarm on the six doors stopped ringing. However, there were no more Metal Guards or Golden Battle Gods. The six doors remained open. The dungeon clearly hadn’t refreshed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1224'>Chapter 1224: Son of Heaven’s Three Swords</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately used spatial teleportation to leave the dungeon, but it didn’t work this time. The blood-colored avatar failed to teleport out.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>In the next second, the blood-colored avatar’s head exploded before the gunshot rang. The game screen went black again.</p>
<p>In that case, it means that any creature that enters by normal means can only fight to the death. They won’t have a chance to come out until the end.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned in thought. If that’s the case, I can’t get my allies to enter. I can only wait for others to enter and pick up the spoils after them.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up. That’s right. I can definitely enter to pick up the spoils. After all, those fellows won’t survive after entering and won’t be able to take anything out. It would be a waste if I don’t take the spoils.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen looked forward to someone quickly entering the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>However, after a day and a half, no creature challenged the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>This was also normal. Be it contracting a Guardian or using Mythical Serum, there were very few Terror-grade humans. The death of one in the League of Guardians was probably enough to deeply upset them. Before figuring out the situation, no one would send someone in rashly.</p>
<p>Seeing the lack of opportunity, Zhou Wen could only continue grinding at home. As long as he ensured that the League of Guardians didn’t clear the Venusian dungeon first and that the dimension couldn’t obtain anything, he was in no rush.</p>
<p>‘Progress: 100%. Synthesis complete.’</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was grinding, a message suddenly popped up. Zhou Wen took a careful look and realized that the fusion synthesis of Light Concealment, Shadow Concealment, and Night Immaculate had completed.</p>
<p>Let me see what the outcome of the fusion is. Zhou Wen opened the fusion window and saw an ancient sword floating there.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the formless Light Concealment Sword, nor was it the shadow of the Shadow Concealment Sword, nor was it the aura of the Night Immaculate Sword. It was an ordinary sheathed ancient sword.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen checked the ancient sword’s stats and saw the words “Son of Heaven’s Three Swords.”</p>
<p>Strange, I’ve clearly fused a sword. Why is it called the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords? Zhou Wen was puzzled as he looked at the detailed stats of the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords.</p>
<p>Son of Heaven’s Three Swords: Terror-grade (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Sword of the Son of Heaven</p>
<p>Life Soul: Dao Sword</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Sword of Unkilling</p>
<p>Terror Form: Son of Heaven</p>
<p>Strength: 99</p>
<p>Speed: 99</p>
<p>Constitution: 99</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 99</p>
<p>Talent Skill: None</p>
<p>Companion Form: Sword of the Son of Heaven</p>
<p>What the hell are these attributes? Sword of Unkilling? Could it be that this sword can’t kill? It’s a Terror-grade Companion Beast after all. It doesn’t even have a single skill. Isn’t this too extreme… Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. The only thing that left him gratified was that the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords had an evolutionary attribute.</p>
<p>This meant that the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords might reach the Calamity grade in the future.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords’ stats were rather impressive. All four stats were 99. This was the highest stats among Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Summoning the Son of Heaven’s Sword, Zhou Wen held the hilt and wanted to pull it out to take a look. However, after a few attempts, the sword remained motionless as though it was stuck from all the rust.</p>
<p>It can’t be… I can’t pull this thing out? It really lives up to its Sword of Unkilling name… Zhou Wen fiddled with it for a while, hoping to figure it out.</p>
<p>However, he tragically realized that no matter what strength he used, he couldn’t pull the sword out. Furthermore, the sword didn’t have any special strength. It was no different from a hard rod.</p>
<p>When it appeared in its own form, it was like a dead object. It didn’t even move, much less fly up to fight.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me? Zhou Wen was depressed. It was difficult to imagine that this was a Terror-grade Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Unable to figure it out, Zhou Wen had no choice but to put away the Son of Heaven’s Sword. He would slowly study it in the future.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also knew that there was definitely something special about the sword, but he was momentarily stumped.</p>
<p>In the next few days, Zhou Wen didn’t see any creatures enter the Venusian instance dungeon. He stayed home to grind.</p>
<p>Ding! When Zhou Wen grinded the underground sea again, a crisp sound of a drop sounded, causing his body to tremble.</p>
<p>When he focused his gaze, he realized that it was a Demon Blood True Dragon Companion Egg.</p>
<p>It’s finally here! Zhou Wen’s hands trembled in excitement. After grinding for so long, he had finally obtained the nine Demon Blood True Dragon Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>He picked up the Companion Egg and saw that it was indeed the Wu Dragon’s Companion Egg. Zhou Wen hurriedly hatched it.</p>
<p>The Wu Dragon Companion Egg’s stats were about the same as the others. It wasn’t too special, so Zhou Wen didn’t expect it to be very powerful. What he wanted to know the most was whether he could fuse the nine Demon Blood True Dragons together.</p>
<p>He first placed the Wu Dragon in the window. The game immediately indicated that it could be fused. Zhou Wen attempted to put the remaining eight dragons on it, and it really worked. There was no indication that it lacked a core.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen pressed the Fusion button, the intense light devoured the nine Demon Blood True Dragons and flooded the entire phone screen.</p>
<p>When the light dissipated, a black crystal-like Companion Egg appeared in the Fusion window. There was also a percentage progress bar below.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I’ll have to wait another two days. Zhou Wen really wanted to know what the outcome of the fusion was, but all he could do was wait.</p>
<p>Now, he only hoped that there wouldn’t be a strange Companion Egg like the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords.</p>
<p>It just so happens that I don’t have any particularly good armor. I hope they fuse into some good Terror-grade armor. Zhou Wen’s body was only at the Mythical stage after all. He was somewhat inferior to a true Terror-grade. For instance, Demonic Neonate seldom participated in head-on battles because of her weak body.</p>
<p>If he had Terror-grade armor, it would greatly enhance Zhou Wen’s strength. At the very least, his life-preservation abilities would be elevated.</p>
<p>With another wish fulfilled, what depressed Zhou Wen the most was his failure to obtain the last of the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions’ skills.</p>
<p>The main reason was that the Endless Sea of Stars was just too huge. It took a lot of time just to grind it once, so Zhou Wen could only rely on luck.</p>
<p>“Living quite a good life recently, eh?”</p>
<p>A message made Zhou Wen, who had been enjoying his days, shiver involuntarily. The message was from The Thearch, who had been silent for a long time.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen replied, but he felt extremely worried. Every time The Thearch came to him, nothing good would happen.</p>
<p>Even with his Terror-grade strength, Zhou Wen didn’t dare rashly head to Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>The stronger he was, the more he could understand how terrifying The Thearch was. After obtaining powerful strength, Zhou Wen knew how terrifying the power of wishes was.</p>
<p>“I want to make a deal with you.” The Thearch quickly sent another message.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1225'>Chapter 1225: Here Comes the Opportunity</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen felt his scalp tingle when he saw the word “deal.” A deal with The Thearch definitely didn’t end well. John was a perfect example that remained fresh in his mind.</p>
<p>“Ahem, The Thearch, I recently saw quite a number of powerful fellows among humans. The Great Skyfiend and Hermit in the League of Guardians are especially strong…” Zhou Wen wanted to change the topic.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you say that there’s Blood Shaman and Cave Era?” The Thearch replied.</p>
<p>“Those two are also super strong. I didn’t have the time to tell you.” Zhou Wen hurriedly replied.</p>
<p>“Why don’t I help you destroy the League of Guardians? What say you?” The Thearch replied mockingly.</p>
<p>“Uh! The League of Guardians has nothing to do with me. Whether it’s destroyed or not is up to you.” Zhou Wen was no longer the kid from before. He didn’t blush even when his thoughts were seen through.</p>
<p>The Thearch clearly wasn’t in the mood to talk to him about this. She directly sent a message and asked: “You didn’t contract a Guardian or fuse with other creatures, so how did you advance to the Mythical stage?”</p>
<p>“I just cultivated an Essence Energy Art, and as time went by, I advanced,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>The Thearch naturally didn’t believe him. In fact, it was impossible.</p>
<p>“If you don’t wish to say, I can just let it pass. However, if you continue talking to me like this, do you believe that I’ll let your fifth limb grow on your head?” The Thearch replied.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen really wanted to see if his present ability could withstand The Thearch’s wish powers. However, considering the immense risk of his fifth limb growing on his head, he decided to see what The Thearch wanted of him.</p>
<p>“What deal do you want to make with me?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I won’t ask how you advanced. But tell me, did you advance to the Mythical stage purely as a human?” The Thearch asked again.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and answered truthfully.</p>
<p>“That’s enough. Help me get something. After it’s done, I’ll tell you a secret,” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>“Can you be more detailed? What do I need to get? What’s the secret you want to tell me?” Zhou Wen was working on a way to reject The Thearch.</p>
<p>“Your hometown is in Guide City, right? There’s a Fire God Platform in Guide Ancient City. There’s a stone saber on it. Pull it out and give it to me,” The Thearch sent a message.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed. The Thearch actually wants that stone saber. What does she want? Could it be that the stone saber can help her escape?</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen thought about it, he said, “I’ve heard of that stone saber, but I’ve heard that no one can pull it out…”</p>
<p>“As long as you are a pure human who advanced to the Mythical stage, you will definitely be able to pull it out.” The Thearch seemed very confident and ignored Zhou Wen’s excuse.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, The Thearch sent another message. “You should have seen the situation in the Venusian dimensional zone. However, you might not know what that dimensional zone implies.”</p>
<p>“You know about the Venusian dimensional zone?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“If you can help me retrieve the stone saber, I can tell you how to obtain the item inside through the Venusian dimensional zone.” The Thearch threw out the bait.</p>
<p>“What’s inside the Venusian dimensional zone?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“Help me retrieve the stone saber and you will know everything.” The Thearch immediately sent another message. “There’s no rush. You can think about it. However, if the fellows from the dimension obtain the thing from the Venusian dimensional zone, I’m afraid the Earth Federation will really become a breeding ground for the dimension.”</p>
<p>“Let me consider it.” Since The Thearch didn’t elaborate, Zhou Wen knew that it was useless to ask further.</p>
<p>If it were in the past, Zhou Wen would definitely have rejected it without any hesitation. However, the bait The Thearch threw out was too much; it left Zhou Wen somewhat tempted.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already learned from Gu Dian that the dimension placed great importance on the item in Venus. If he really couldn’t clear the Venusian instance dungeon before the dimension did, he might really have to rely on The Thearch’s strength.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen couldn’t confirm if The Thearch was telling the truth, so he naturally wouldn’t easily believe her.</p>
<p>“There’s no rush. I can divulge some information first. There are six Terror-grade Golden Battle Gods in Venus who can fire bullets of different attributes. After them, there will be a Calamity-grade metal creature. Help me get the stone saber. I have a way that will allow you to kill that Calamity-grade metal creature.”</p>
<p>“What’s the name of that Calamity-grade metal creature?” Zhou Wen knew that The Thearch wasn’t spouting nonsense. He had already verified the existence of the subsequent Calamity-grade creature.</p>
<p>“Bring the stone saber to Chess Mountain when you’ve thought it through.” The Thearch didn’t answer him. She didn’t send any more messages after that.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned in thought. From the looks of it, The Thearch really knows something about the Venusian instance dungeon, but she doesn’t want the item in the Venusian instance dungeon. Instead, she wants the stone saber. Could it be that the stone saber is more precious than the item in the Venusian instance dungeon? Or can the stone saber help her escape?</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen still couldn’t figure out what The Thearch was up to.</p>
<p>The stone saber in Guide Ancient City couldn’t be pulled out. Otherwise, not only would Guide Ancient City undergo a breakout, but a large number of high-level dimensional creatures would appear. Zhou Wen didn’t know what would ensue if he completely pulled out the stone saber.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously investigated its origins.</p>
<p>The Fire God Platform was also known as the Yanbo Platform. It was the first place in the East District used for astronomy, and Yanbo was the Fire God, also the founder of the Shang Dynasty. Speaking of which, it was somewhat related to Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>However, when it came to a Fire God, the first thing most people in the East District thought of was Zhurong, not Yanbo.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was born and raised in Guide City, the Fire God he recognized wasn’t Yanbo Consort, but Suirenshi, who introduced fire to humans. He was the leader of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors.</p>
<p>Could the Ancient Sovereign Sutra engraved on Fire God Platform be related to Suirenshi? If the stone saber is related to Suirenshi, it’s easier to understand. The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more convinced he was of its likelihood.</p>
<p>With The Thearch’s request, Zhou Wen had the urge to return to Guide Ancient City to take a look.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen still didn’t head to Guide Ancient City to prevent himself from being exploited by The Thearch.</p>
<p>He stayed at home and continued grinding dungeons. He grinded the Venusian instance dungeon once a day, but it was too slow. He couldn’t farm Companion Eggs on a large scale. Instead, he obtained a few Terror-grade dimensional crystals which he fed to Banana Fairy. Her stats had increased significantly, averaging above 90 points.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he could only farm it once a day. Most of the time, Zhou Wen could only farm ordinary dungeons.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the phone’s live broadcast stirred. Another creature arrived in front of the Venusian dimensional zone. It was the black dragon that had appeared previously.</p>
<p>Here’s my chance. Zhou Wen’s spirits were lifted. Farming the Venusian instance dungeon once a day was just too slow.. Now was the best time to pick up freebies.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1226'>Chapter 1226: Limitless Demon Dragon King</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Let me wait and see. Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to head over. He planned on understanding the situation first.</p>
<p>His main goal was to determine the black dragon’s level. Although it didn’t seem like a Calamity-grade creature, the old saying was right. One couldn’t judge a book by its cover. If it was a Calamity-grade, Zhou Wen might very well be killed if he went to pick up the spoils.</p>
<p>It wasn’t only Zhou Wen. Many people in the Federation had their eyes peeled to screen. Many bigwigs from various factions wanted to figure out what was so special about the Venusian dimensional zone and why the Cube was broadcasting it.</p>
<p>The black dragon entered the dimensional zone. The situation inside was the same as before—the six doors were closed, and a Metal Guard was in the room.</p>
<p>This was just as Zhou Wen had imagined. Every time a creature entered the Venusian dimensional zone in reality, the same number of dimensional creatures would appear. It felt like a game refreshing its map, but it also felt different.</p>
<p>The black dragon spat out dragon breath and killed the Metal Guard. It looked easy, definitely placing it in the ranks at or above the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen saw the six doors open, his fingers suddenly vibrated. He took out his phone and saw that the nine Demon Blood True Dragons’ fusion had reached 100%.</p>
<p>He hurriedly opened the fusion window and saw a black demon dragon appear inside.</p>
<p>However, this demon dragon was somewhat different from the previous Demon Blood True Dragon.</p>
<p>This demon dragon’s body seemed to be carved from black gemstones. There was no sign of it having nine heads. It had only one dragon head with a pair of corresponding dragon horns.</p>
<p>It only had one pair of eyes as well, but the pupils were in the form of the Eight Trigrams Taiji symbol. Apart from that, its body wasn’t any smaller than the typical Demon Dragon True Dragon, but it looked much more mightier.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at its detailed information, hoping that it was a Terror-grade armor. After all, the original Demon Blood True Dragons had armor forms. The possibility of this Demon Dragon being an armor was very high.</p>
<p>Limitless Demon Dragon King: Terror</p>
<p>Life Providence: Dragon King</p>
<p>Life Soul: Demon King</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Limitless Wheel</p>
<p>Terror Form: Omega Dao</p>
<p>Strength: 99</p>
<p>Speed: 99</p>
<p>Constitution: 99</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 99</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Dragon Breath, Limitless Eyes, Demon Dragon Transformation</p>
<p>Companion Form: Armor</p>
<p>The armor companion form was expected, but the Limitless Demon Dragon King didn’t have an Evolvable attribute. This left Zhou Wen somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>Apart from that, Zhou Wen was very satisfied with the Limitless Demon Dragon King’s various skills and stats.</p>
<p>Companion Beasts that form a complete set don’t necessarily produce one with an evolvable attribute. Zhou Wen carefully looked at the Limitless Demon Dragon King’s various abilities.</p>
<p>The Dragon King Life Providence had an extremely strong immunity to all sorts of elements. It was a little overboard to say it was immune to all elements, but it was at least immune to 80-90% of them.</p>
<p>The Demon King could demonize bodies to give them physical immunity. Although it wasn’t completely immune, with the Dragon King Life Providence, it had a high immunity to all sorts of powers. Its defense was astonishing.</p>
<p>The Limitless Wheel was an ability that Zhou Wen valued the most. This was a skill that allowed him to freely transfer his strength. When combined with the use of Limitless Eyes, he could achieve the exchange of strength between different creatures, just like the nine Demon Blood True Dragons.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen needed to cast the Limitless Wheel on other creatures ahead of time. Furthermore, he needed the cooperation of the creatures to complete it. At the same time, he could only form a Limitless connection with eight creatures.</p>
<p>The Terror form’s Omega Dao seemed to be a super state. Zhou Wen hadn’t experimented with it yet, so he didn’t know how useful it was.</p>
<p>Demon Dragon Transformation could make it’s body stronger. Its effects also needed to be tested in actual combat.</p>
<p>After summoning the Limitless Demon Dragon King in its companion form, a mysterious black crystal armor appeared on Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The black crystal scale armor enveloped Zhou Wen’s body without leaving any gaps. The helmet was in the shape of a dragon’s head, and there was a pair of dragon horns on his head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, who was wearing the Dragon King armor, was like a humanoid dragon carved from black gems. He exuded mystery and bizarreness, but he also emitted a terrifying aura.</p>
<p>I wonder how its defense is. I’ll find an opportunity to test it later. Zhou Wen felt that the armor’s appearance was a little exaggerated, but it likely wasn’t lacking in ability. After all, its stats and skills were amazing.</p>
<p>On the Cube’s screen, the black dragon had already finished off a large number of Metal Guards. Its body was extremely strong, so the bullets from the Metal Guards were useless against it. They were torn to pieces by the black dragon.</p>
<p>Many dimensional crystals dropped to the ground, as well as two Metal Guard Companion Eggs. The Earthlings were envious, but the black dragon didn’t pick them up.</p>
<p>Soon, the Golden Battle God Mark I appeared. His freezing bullets hit the Terror-form black dragon. Although the freezing effect showed some effects, it was obvious that it wasn’t very effective.</p>
<p>The black dragon pounced forward to engage the Golden Battle God in melee combat. Both of their bodies were especially powerful, but the black dragon ultimately gained the upper hand. After fighting for more than an hour, it finally killed the Golden Battle God.</p>
<p>The Golden Battle God Mark II appeared next. His flaming bullets weren’t very effective against the black dragon, so it ended up in a melee battle again.</p>
<p>The black dragon obtained final victory again, but it was obvious that it had suffered some damage and was rather drained.</p>
<p>A third Golden Battle God appeared. This Golden Battle God had lightning bullets which had a paralyzing effect. When it struck the black dragon, it caused a portion of its body to be paralyzed. Compounded by its earlier injuries and exhaustion, the situation didn’t look good.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already certain that the black dragon was at the Terror grade. It would be difficult for it to defeat all the Golden Battle Gods. It was time to pick up the spoils.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen used Singularity Universe’s teleportation ability and arrived on Venus again. He wore his new Dragon King armor.</p>
<p>Many humans in the Federation and overseas were watching this battle. As neither side was human, they didn’t show obvious support for either party.</p>
<p>However, the dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs on the ground were tantalizing. As they watched, the black dragon went into berserk mode and withstood the paralyzing effects of the lightning bullets as it charged at the Golden Battle God.</p>
<p>After biting at its opponent crazily and paying a considerable price, it finally killed the Golden Battle God Mark III. A golden Companion Egg dropped.</p>
<p>“A Terror-grade Companion Egg!” Everyone widened their eyes as they looked at the golden Companion Egg. Their drool was about to drip down.</p>
<p>That was a Terror-grade Companion Egg. Furthermore, it had such powerful strength. Who wouldn’t want it? Unfortunately, no one could enter.</p>
<p>The black dragon wasn’t interested in the Companion Egg either. It had no intention of picking it up, making the allure even more irresistible. They wished they could run in and grab it with their mouths before running out.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a black figure appeared on the screen, stunning all the spectating beings.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1227'>Chapter 1227: The Treasure Looter</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Everyone was stunned when they identified the figure.</p>
<p>“Strange, the ones that came out previously were all golden robots. Why did something made of black crystal suddenly appear? It’s much smaller. Is it a new type?”</p>
<p>“This fellow doesn’t seem to have walked out of the door.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>Everyone discussed spiritedly. Even the black dragon in the room was taken aback. It didn’t attack immediately.</p>
<p>Just as everyone was feeling puzzled, the Golden Battle God Mark IV walked out, leaving them dumbfounded. They didn’t know what was going on. Why were there two different creatures? Previously, only one Golden Battle God appeared at a time.</p>
<p>Before they could react, Zhou Wen had already flashed across the room and stored away the dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs on the ground, including the Golden Battle God Mark III Companion Egg.</p>
<p>The people watching the Cube’s live stream immediately broke out into an uproar. They understood what had happened.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, that fellow isn’t from the Venusian dimensional zone. He’s there to loot.”</p>
<p>“That’s not looting, it’s called picking up treasures, alright?”</p>
<p>“That works too? Didn’t they say that the Cube’s teleportation function is disabled when someone is challenging the Venusian dimensional zone? How did he enter?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps he’s an otherworldly creature to begin with. Like the gold person and the black dragon, he’s from the cosmos.”</p>
<p>“But he shouldn’t be able to enter the dimensional zone, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s not right. Why does he look human? The thing he’s wearing is Companion Beast armor, right?”</p>
<p>“Human? That’s impossible, right?”</p>
<p>“The key is how did he enter?”</p>
<p>As people discussed, the Golden Battle God had already attacked. However, as Zhou Wen retreated behind the black dragon, the Golden Battle God’s first target was still the black dragon.</p>
<p>The black dragon roared and spewed out dragon breath, hoping to block the Golden Battle God’s bullet.</p>
<p>However, the Golden Battle God’s bullet was somewhat special. It had a powerful spinning and drilling effect. It penetrated the black dragon’s dragon breath and shot into its body. The bullet drilled into its flesh, causing blood to immediately gush out. The black dragon roared in pain.</p>
<p>The Golden Battle God Mark IV bullet’s destructive power was very strong. It was the nemesis of the black dragon’s element-immunity attribute. Furthermore, the black dragon was already quite injured, so it was quickly thrown into a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>As though it knew that it was doomed, the black dragon had the intention to go all out. It charged forward, meeting the blanketing bullets.</p>
<p>Its abdomen was almost riddled with holes, but it didn’t die. It pounced on the Golden Battle God and wanted to bite off its head.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was already gravely injured, and its strength was greatly reduced. The Golden Battle God held its chin up with one hand, preventing it from biting down.</p>
<p>The black dragon still held on to the Golden Battle God, but it was no longer of much use. The other gun in the Golden Battle God’s hand was already aimed at its head.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>A black figure appeared behind the Golden Battle God like a ghost. A narrow saber stabbed through the Golden Battle God’s chest, piercing through the energy source inside.</p>
<p>The Golden Battle God’s body immediately lost its strength. The black dragon roared repeatedly and ruthlessly tore the Golden Battle God’s corpse apart.</p>
<p>A dimensional crystal dropped and Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate to put it away. Then, he retreated to the other corner of the room and maintained a certain distance from the black dragon.</p>
<p>The black dragon glanced at Zhou Wen but didn’t attack. Clearly, its intelligence wasn’t low.</p>
<p>“That works? What’s that fellow’s background?”</p>
<p>“How did he get in?”</p>
<p>People from the various factions were guessing Zhou Wen’s origins. In the League of Guardians, Blood Shaman, Cave Era, Great Skyfiend, and Hermit were all present.</p>
<p>Many Guardians were also watching the battle. Sitting high on the main seat was a masked man. His face couldn’t be seen, but his eyes seemed to be so clear that one could see a reflection.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, this man was the master of the League of Guardians, Immortal.</p>
<p>“Cave Era, what are your thoughts?” Immortal looked at the scene on the Cube and asked casually.</p>
<p>“It’s undoubtedly a human. Furthermore, he has very powerful spatial powers,” said Cave Era.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao, who had contracted Great Skyfiend, said, “In that case, as long as one has spatial powers, even if one doesn’t open the entrance to the Venusian dimensional zone, they can still enter?”</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, that’s right,” Cave Era answered.</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, we only need to find a Guardian with spatial teleportation powers to enter the Venusian dimensional zone like that person. Now, the chances of us clearing the dimensional zone are much higher,” Uesugi Nao said.</p>
<p>Hermit continued, “That might not be the case. There are many types of spatial powers. Perhaps not all spatial powers can enter. Furthermore, there aren’t many Guardians who have spatial abilities like interstellar teleportation. There are even fewer who have reached the Terror grade. If we only rely on flying, it will take too long to reach Venus. When that happens, the Venusian dimensional zone might have long been cleared.”</p>
<p>“Can you tell who this person is?” Immortal asked again.</p>
<p>Hermit shook his head slightly. “I can’t tell. However, I’m certain that it’s not someone from the Holy Spirit Association. The Holy Spirit Association only has one Terror-grade expert who specializes in spatial powers. We’ve all seen him before. It’s not him.”</p>
<p>“Could it be Thief Sage?” asked Blood Shaman.</p>
<p>“That’s very likely. Thief Sage is best at spatial teleportation. Furthermore, such actions are in line with his actions. However, there’s no way to confirm that it’s him or someone else,” Hermit said.</p>
<p>“Regardless of whether he’s Thief Sage, find him. It’s naturally best if it’s him. If it’s not him, we can also use his spatial teleportation ability to send our people in,” Immortal said.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll do it now.” Hermit bowed and left.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Far away in the South Pole, Liu Yun, who was standing on the snow watching the Cube, suddenly felt his nose itch for no reason. He couldn’t help but sneeze.</p>
<p>“Who’s missing me?” Liu Yun rubbed his nose as he muttered to himself.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The Golden Battle God Mark V appeared, and the black dragon could only drag its severely injured body to fight.</p>
<p>While the Golden Battle God was distracted, Zhou Wen teleported behind it and stabbed at its energy source again.</p>
<p>The six Golden Battle Gods energy sources appeared in different locations. It wasn’t easy to stab them with one strike. However, for someone like Zhou Wen who was familiar with the Golden Battle Gods, it wasn’t difficult.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s help, the black dragon killed the Golden Battle God Mark V, but unfortunately, nothing dropped.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used the same method to help the black dragon kill the Golden Battle God Mark VI, but unfortunately, nothing dropped again.</p>
<p>The alarms on the six doors sounded at the same time.. Something truly terrifying was coming.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1228'>Chapter 1228: The One and Only Looter King</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare stay for long as he teleported back to Earth. Zhou Wen’s luck was pretty good—his teleportation took him to a city. He removed the Companion Beasts over him, returning to his original appearance.</p>
<p>It looked like a city in the West District. Zhou Wen didn’t carefully identify where he was. He took out his phone and watched the live broadcast of the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>The alarms on the six doors were ringing. The black dragon was heavily injured. Although it looked at the doors warily, it didn’t even know which door the other party would come out from.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Before the gunshot was heard, the black dragon’s head exploded from a bullet. Dragon blood and brain matter splattered as the dragon body collapsed. Then, the Cube’s scene switched. Without a doubt, the Terror-grade black dragon had died inside.</p>
<p>Humanity didn’t even manage to get a gander at the person who killed the black dragon. Zhou Wen then found some high-speed slow-motion cameras on the Internet and could barely see that the bullet had shot out from one of the doors. He couldn’t even see what it looked like—it was only a blurry shadow.</p>
<p>The various factions analyzed the information obtained from this battle. They had pretty much analyzed the first four of the six Golden Battle Gods’ abilities. As for the last two, due to Zhou Wen’s interference, the information wasn’t complete, but they could roughly think of a reliable solution.</p>
<p>However, everyone shook their heads when they saw the final shot. For the time being, no one had the confidence to block it.</p>
<p>Most people were discussing Zhou Wen, who had taken advantage of the situation. They were very curious as to what kind of person had the ability and guts to snatch food from the tiger’s mouth under such circumstances and retreat in time.</p>
<p>As they didn’t know his origins, many media outlets gave Zhou Wen a nickname when writing reports about him.</p>
<p>There were all sorts of nicknames such as “Looter King”, “Adventurer King”, “Shameless Thief”, “Person Best At Taking Advantage”, and “Space Transporter.”</p>
<p>In the end, most people used the term “Looter King.” Furthermore, many media outlets determined that Looter King might be human, but there were also many people who didn’t think of him as human.</p>
<p>Many factions on Earth had the same idea. They could naturally tell that Zhou Wen was using spatial teleportation to enter the Venusian dimensional zone. The factions with such talents were eager to have a share of the loot.</p>
<p>After Liu Yun finished watching the entire process, he was very tempted. However, after careful consideration, he didn’t dare head to Venus. Like Zhou Wen, he waited for the other creatures to enter before taking advantage of the opportunity.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s patience didn’t mean that everyone was patient.</p>
<p>Overseas, there was a contractor with a spatial Guardian who chose to enter the Venusian dimensional zone through the Cube.</p>
<p>Not all spatial powers had interstellar teleportation abilities, much less a Mythical Guardian.</p>
<p>When he reached the entrance to the Venusian dimensional zone, the Cube began its live broadcast again.</p>
<p>When people saw him use spatial teleportation to enter the dimensional zone and fight the Metal Guards inside, they immediately realized that he was a Mythical Guardian who was here to take advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>His goal was probably to kill a few Metal Guards before teleporting out.</p>
<p>Due to footage from the previous battles, the Guardian knew the Metal Guard very well. He had already thought of a way to restrain it and easily killed the Metal Guard. Furthermore, he was very lucky to have a Companion Egg drop.</p>
<p>The Guardian gleefully picked up the Companion Egg and wanted to teleport away before the six doors opened. His idea of taking advantage of the situation was to simply kill one Metal Guard.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, after attempting to teleport, the Guardian’s expression changed drastically. He couldn’t leave the dimensional zone and was still trapped in the room.</p>
<p>In the next second, the six doors opened. Groups of Metal Guards rushed out with guns in hand. The bullets intertwined into an inescapable net.</p>
<p>The Guardian teleported a few times and summoned a Companion Beast to block them, but in the end, he was riddled with bullets that killed him along with his Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Instantly, all the humans watching the live broadcast were stunned. They didn’t know what was happening.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was secretly glad that he had held back from teleporting in.</p>
<p>“Heavens, what happened just now? Why didn’t the Guardian teleport away?”</p>
<p>“Do you think anyone can be the Looter King? Looter King is at the Terror grade—an existence who can work with the black dragon to kill the Golden Battle Gods. Isn’t it courting death for a Mythical creature to want to loot?”</p>
<p>“Looter King is really powerful. He managed to escape after looting, but this fellow couldn’t even return alive.”</p>
<p>“For the same spatial teleportation ability, the effects of the Terror-grade and Mythical-grade should be about the same. Why can Looter King escape, but not the Guardian?”</p>
<p>“There must be some other restriction. Looter King is somehow able to break the restrictions.”</p>
<p>“There can only be one Looter King after all. There’s a risk when looting. One has to be careful.”</p>
<p>Everyone discussed spiritedly. This also alarmed the factions who wanted to use their spatial powers to take advantage of the situation like Zhou Wen. They didn’t dare act rashly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was grinding dungeons in-game and didn’t know about the Guardian. Otherwise, he would have taken advantage of it.</p>
<p>However, after watching the recording, Zhou Wen knew what the problem was. It wasn’t that the Mythical spatial transmission ability couldn’t be used, but that people who used the Cube to reach Venus were incapable of leaving the dimensional zone. They could only fight to the end.</p>
<p>The spatial ability he used wasn’t special. However, he couldn’t teleport through the Cube or use his blood to open the Venusian instance dungeon.</p>
<p>After this incident, no one dared to take advantage of the loopholes in the rules.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen farmed the Venusian instance dungeon again in-game, but he still failed to dodge the bullet. The shot was just too terrifying. Even the Limitless Demon Dragon King’s helmet exploded. His powerful damage immunity couldn’t withstand the bullet’s headshot. Clearly, the difference in strength was too great.</p>
<p>10% or even 5% of the destructive power wasn’t something Zhou Wen’s body could withstand.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, there’s no doubt that it’s a Calamity-grade creature. Do humans nowadays really have the ability to defeat a Calamity-grade to clear the Venusian instance dungeon? Zhou Wen wasn’t optimistic at all.</p>
<p>After more than a day, another creature entered the Venusian instance dungeon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen this creature before. It was the skeleton that resembled the Grim Reaper. It wore a cloak and held a scythe in its hands. It had opened the dungeon using the normal method.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched it kill the Metal Guard and realized that its strength was likely only at the Terror grade. However, the previous battle had already proven that the survival rate of a Terror-grade creature in the dungeon was pathetically low.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen really couldn’t figure out why the skeleton would choose to enter the Venusian dimensional zone under such circumstances.</p>
<p>Wait. What if entering Venus’s dimensional zone wasn’t of their free will but a result of coercion? An idea flashed in Zhou Wen’s mind.</p>
<p>Combining Tsukuyomi’s forced departure from Earth and the continuous attempts of these creatures into the Venusian instance dungeon, Zhou Wen thought of a possibility. Perhaps these creatures had their reasons for entering the Venusian dimensional zone. They hadn’t entered willingly.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, will Tsukuyomi ultimately enter? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but worry when he thought of Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>Although Tsukuyomi was a Calamity-grade creature and might have the possibility of defeating the Venusian Calamity-grade creature, who could guarantee her victory?</p>
<h3 id='chapter1229'>Chapter 1229: Skeleton</h3>
<p>The Grim Reaper-like skeleton shuttled through the bullets like a ghost. The bullets struck its cloak, but they passed through it without injuring its body.</p>
<p>Instead, the scythe in the skeleton’s hand sliced through the horde of Metal Guards like it was culling chives. Soon, many dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs dropped to the ground.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to enter as he continued watching the battle in front of a Cube.</p>
<p>Soon, the skeleton welcomed the Golden Battle God Mark I. When the frost bullet hit the skeleton’s body, it penetrated its body like an ordinary bullet.</p>
<p>Even if the Golden Battle God took the initiative to detonate the Frost Bullet, the skeleton wasn’t affected at all amidst the cold fog. Instead, it was like a devil in hell. The scythe in its hands turned into an ice scythe and split the Golden Battle God’s body into two.</p>
<p>“What creature is that? It’s so powerful. It killed the Golden Battle God with one strike!”</p>
<p>“This fellow looks like he has a chance of fighting to the end.”</p>
<p>“Who knows? Let’s wait and see.”</p>
<p>“Could that Grim Reaper-like fellow be a Calamity-grade existence?”</p>
<p>As people discussed, the Golden Battle God Mark II appeared. Flames exploded as terrifying flames devoured the entire room.</p>
<p>However, the skeleton rushed out from the flames. Its body and scythe were covered in flames, making it appear like a flaming devil. It culled the Golden Battle God Mark II under its scythe.</p>
<p>How powerful! Even Zhou Wen was surprised by the skeleton’s strength.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t believe that it was at the Calamity grade. The skeleton was very strong, but it was still a distance away from the Calamity grade. At the very least, from the Calamity-grade creatures he had seen, the skeleton wasn’t at that level.</p>
<p>After the Golden Battle God Mark II was killed, a Companion Egg dropped.</p>
<p>Just as the skeleton was about to pick up the Companion Egg, he suddenly saw a black shadow flash. A figure snatched the Companion Egg in front of him.</p>
<p>The skeleton was slightly taken aback. While he was in a daze, Zhou Wen had already taken away the other Mythical dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, Looter King has appeared again!”</p>
<p>“Is this fellow addicted to looting?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t he afraid that the skeleton will kill him from pissing him off?”</p>
<p>“Another Terror-grade Companion Egg has been taken by him. This killing is way too easy.”</p>
<p>Everyone was envious and jealous. As for the skeleton, it was clearly different from the black dragon. When it saw Zhou Wen snatch the Companion Egg, it didn’t hesitate to slash at him.</p>
<p>Its figure was like a ghost, so fast that one couldn’t see it clearly. However, Zhou Wen teleported and dodged the skeleton’s attack.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t leave the room because there was no place on Venus where he could view the Cube. There was no signal on his phone either. Even if he teleported back to Earth, he might not be able to teleport to a place with a signal. If he went out, he wouldn’t know what was happening in the room. The best way was to stay in the room and leave after picking up all the loot.</p>
<p>The skeleton wanted to attack Zhou Wen, but the Golden Battle God had already appeared. Lightning bullets spewed out crazily, giving the skeleton no chance to pay attention to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Of the Golden Battle God Companion Eggs, I already have three—Mark II, III, and IV. If I can gather all six, will I be able to fuse a set? What can a Terror-grade Companion Beast set produce through fusion? A Calamity-grade creature? Zhou Wen was filled with anticipation.</p>
<p>A Mythical set fused to form a Terror-grade creature, so it did seem reasonable that a Terror set would fuse into a Calamity-grade creature.</p>
<p>The skeleton was really strong. When facing the Golden Battle God Mark III, it quickly gained the upper hand again. The bullets with special attributes couldn’t injure it at all.</p>
<p>Even with the lightning around him, the skeleton could draw upon the power of the lightning as his own. It ended up increasing his strength.</p>
<p>This fellow’s skill is very powerful! Zhou Wen looked at the skeleton and made a plan. Since this fellow is definitely doomed, why don’t I kill it? Perhaps a Companion Egg will drop?</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on taking action now. He continued watching the battle from a corner in the room.</p>
<p>The third, fourth, fifth, and sixth Golden Battle Gods were killed by the skeleton’s scythe. They didn’t cause too much trouble for him. It could be seen that the skeleton’s strength was probably top-notch among the Terror-grade existences.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after killing four Golden Battle Gods, only one stat crystal dropped. Naturally, it was snatched by Zhou Wen again.</p>
<p>The alarms on the six doors sounded at the same time. Zhou Wen took a deep breath. This time, he didn’t teleport away. Instead, he took out a Substitute Talisman and stuck it on his head.</p>
<p>The success rate of producing a Substitute Talisman was too low, but it was indeed useful for preserving his life. Zhou Wen would draw a few whenever he was free, but unfortunately, he had too few successes.</p>
<p>Up to now, he only had two. Typically, Zhou Wen couldn’t bear to use them.</p>
<p>This time, he had only taken it out as a form of insurance. This was because Zhou Wen had already tested it when he entered the Venusian instance dungeon. If two creatures were present at the same time, the monster behind the door would target one at a time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously summoned Banana Fairy, Golden Battle God, and Asura to accompany him, but the three Terror-grade Companion Beasts were each shot and killed on the spot. He didn’t even see what the creature looked like before the blood-colored avatar was killed.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen summoned his Mythical Companion Beast, the first to be killed was the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen could roughly determine that the creature inside the door would target the most powerful creature first.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was only at the Mythical stage, so if there was a Terror-grade creature present, the first to be killed would be the Terror-grade creature. And without a Terror-grade creature present, he would be killed for standing out.</p>
<p>Of course, just in case, Zhou Wen stuck a Substitute Talisman on himself.</p>
<p>The skeleton was on high alert as he stared intently at one of the doors. It was where the last bullet had shot out.</p>
<p>However, according to Zhou Wen’s experience, the bullets might not shoot out from the same door. If he focused his attention on the door, he would probably suffer greatly.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen wanted to know if the skeleton could withstand the shot. If a top Terror creature like him couldn’t even withstand a single shot, without a Calamity-grade assistant, the chances of him clearing the Venusian instance dungeon were almost zero.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Before the gunshot, the cloak on the skeleton’s head was lifted by a powerful force, revealing a bald skull.</p>
<p>One side of the skull’s head shattered and, along with the entire head, exploded like a watermelon.</p>
<p>The skeleton’s body was also slammed into the wall by the powerful force. All his bones scattered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to teleport away, but he suddenly realized that all the bones of the shattered skeleton were trembling. As for the door, it didn’t immediately fire a second shot.</p>
<p>In the next second, under everyone’s gaze, the bones emitted gray gas before flying up and condensing into the skeleton.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1230'>Chapter 1230: Grim Reaper No. 10</h3>
<p>He withstood the shot! Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>Although he had withstood the shot at the cost of his life, it was still a huge improvement compared to other Terror-grade creatures.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Another gunshot sounded as the skeleton was reduced to dust. However, its body quickly reformed and walked towards the door that shot the bullet.</p>
<p>“He blocked it again?” In the League of Guardians, Immortal’s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>The four Heavenly Kings were also surprised. As long as one could withstand the shots, there was still hope. The most terrifying thing was the inability to withstand the shots at all. That would imply zero chance.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the League of Guardians. Many big shots had strange looks in their eyes when they saw this scene. They were secretly considering the various possibilities.</p>
<p>Everyone’s first thought was to find an existence like the skeleton to block the gunshots.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The skeleton was blasted apart again and again, but it repeatedly stood up. It was obvious that the skeleton possessed very special abilities. It wasn’t as simple as self-healing; otherwise, he would have long died.</p>
<p>Just as everyone believed that they had finally seen a ray of light, the skeleton’s body was once again blasted apart from the seventh gunshot. However, this time, the skeleton’s body directly disintegrated.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>An oval bone object dropped from the skeleton’s dispersed body, producing a series of crisp and ear-piercing sounds.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reacted extremely fast. He instantly sobered up and teleported over to grab the bone object before teleporting out of the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>“That actually works… He takes advantage of both sides… He loots both parties…” Everyone was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“All the advantages have been taken by Looter King.”</p>
<p>“It’s his ability to loot. If you have the ability, try doing so too.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Looter King’s spatial teleportation ability is really powerful.”</p>
<p>“The Guardian from before serves as a lesson. It’s not that easy to take advantage of the situation.”</p>
<p>Ordinary people were discussing the matter of the Looter King, but existences like the League of Guardians’ upper echelons weren’t focused on Zhou Wen. They wanted to know why the skeleton had died.</p>
<p>Did the skeleton’s abilities reach their limits, or did the dimensional creature’s abilities behind the door undergo new changes?</p>
<p>“Cave Era, can you analyze the seventh shot?” Immortal asked Cave Era.</p>
<p>Cave Era was good at time. If anyone could figure out something, it would be her.</p>
<p>“I need to give it a try. I need to use some supplementary items to circulate the power of time to reforge the gunshot’s progression,” Cave Era said after some hesitation.</p>
<p>“How long will it take?” Immortal asked.</p>
<p>“At least three days,” Cave Era answered.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The Ultimate Family Clan of the North District.</p>
<p>“Sadie, did you see it?” Lance and company looked at Sadie. Sadie, who had the Eye of Odin, was the person who was most likely to see the seventh shot clearly.</p>
<p>“That shot was too fast. It’s still difficult to discern it clearly when I slow it down. I need some time to analyze it,” Sadie said helplessly.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The same situation kept happening in the various major powers. The analysts of the various factions began taking action.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t analyze the shot. At that moment, he was hugging a bone and smiling foolishly.</p>
<p>I’ve made a killing… I’ve made a huge killing this time… Zhou Wen hugged the oval bone and was just short of kissing it.</p>
<p>This was actually the skeleton’s Companion Egg. Furthermore, his stats and abilities were so powerful that Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed.</p>
<p>Grim Reaper No. 10: Terror</p>
<p>Life Providence: Undying Body</p>
<p>Life Soul: Grim Reaper’s Scythe</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Immortality</p>
<p>Terror form: Grim Reaper’s Tenth Memorial.</p>
<p>Strength: 99</p>
<p>Speed: 99</p>
<p>Constitution: 99</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 99</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Grim Reaper’s Cull, Shadow of the Underworld, Dance of the Dead, Grim Reaper’s Backlash</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>There was no need to mention how powerful Grim Reaper No. 10’s combat strength was. Its strongest point was that it had an undying body and indestructibility. This was the key to its ability to withstand the Calamity-grade forces.</p>
<p>In terms of offensive strength, Grim Reaper No. 10 was top-notch among the Terror grade, but compared to the Calamity grade, he was still slaughtered.</p>
<p>However, its Life Providence and Wheel of Destiny allowed it to have extremely powerful survival abilities.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hatched Grim Reaper No. 10 and took it into the game. This time, he wasn’t going to the Venusian dungeon, but to have his Terror-grade Companion Beasts attack Grim Reaper No. 10.</p>
<p>Grim Reaper No. 10’s body was destroyed again and again. It was repeatedly destroyed seven times, but it still managed to recover.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept trying, but no matter how many times he tried, Grim Reaper No. 10 could recover. Clearly, the reason it was killed by the seventh shot wasn’t because its abilities had reached their limits, but because the Calamity-grade power had undergone a special change.</p>
<p>The various factions could only use their present information to analyze it, but Zhou Wen had an additional advantage. With Grim Reaper No. 10, he could enter the game to experiment again and again.</p>
<p>This was much more effective than using other Terror-grade Companion Beasts to forcefully withstand the attack. It was also more likely for him to figure out the secret of the seventh shot.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the twenty-four hours weren’t up. Zhou Wen couldn’t immediately take Grim Reaper No. 10 into the Venusian dungeon.</p>
<p>As for entering the Venusian dimensional zone in real life, Zhou Wen definitely wouldn’t go unless he tailed others to loot the spoils.</p>
<p>The various families were secretly taking action. Their targets were basically locked onto Guardians or Companion Beasts with spatial and powerful immortality abilities.</p>
<p>Only with these two powers could one successfully take down the Venusian dimensional zone. Otherwise, no matter how many people went, they would only be sending themselves to their deaths.</p>
<p>After Grim Reaper No. 10, no creature challenged the Venusian dimensional zone again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept grinding and finally managed to wait out the twenty-four hours . He immediately led Grim Reaper No. 10 into the game’s Venusian instance dungeon.</p>
<p>Perhaps he had used up all his luck in reality, but when he attempted the Venusian instance dungeon again, not even a Metal Guard Companion Egg dropped. much less a Golden Battle God Companion Egg.</p>
<p>However, none of this was important. All Zhou Wen wanted to know was why Grim Reaper No. 10 died from the seventh shot.</p>
<p>The alarm sounded as Zhou Wen used Great Brahma’s power. At the same time, he pushed Truth Listener’s ability to its limits. He also wanted to analyze the secret of the seventh shot.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The sound of a gunshot rang out. Even someone as powerful as Grim Reaper No. 10 had his body blasted apart.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Grim Reaper No. 10 quickly recovered. Just like in reality, he received the shots over and over again. Grim Reaper No. 10 was repeatedly killed and revived.</p>
<p>The first six shots were identical to the ones in reality, but Zhou Wen still observed them carefully. He had to find the difference between the seventh shot and the first six shots.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Finally, the seventh gunshot sounded. Grim Reaper No. 10 died as his body was reduced to ashes. Just like in reality, he couldn’t revive.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1231'>Chapter 1231: Seventh Shot That Spells Certain Death</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly summoned Banana Fairy, the three Golden Battle Gods, Deva Asura, Limitless Demon Dragon King, and Son of Heaven’s Three Swords, allowing them to rush towards the door that shot out the bullets.</p>
<p>A series of gunshots sounded. Apart from the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords held by Zhou Wen, the other Terror-grade Companion Beasts were shot and killed one by one. They didn’t even have the chance to dodge as they were almost immediately wiped out.</p>
<p>The reason why it was ‘almost’ was because Deva Asura dodged the first bullet that was aimed at him. However, with another shot, Deva Asura was still killed.</p>
<p>He can actually dodge it? Zhou Wen was surprised that Deva Asura could dodge the shot. He originally imagined that it would be difficult for him to fight a Calamity-grade expert, like Grim Reaper No. 10, head-on.</p>
<p>However, Deva Asura’s successful dodge made Zhou Wen see another possibility.</p>
<p>The reason Deva Asura could dodge was naturally due to luck and good fortune. Deva Asura definitely couldn’t dodge the shot from speed alone. After all, he couldn’t even dodge Zhou Wen’s teleportation in time. No matter how fast Deva Asura was, he couldn’t be faster than Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>If I can dodge using luck and fortune, I might have a solution. Zhou Wen thought of the Devas in the Deva Realm. Those Devas had luck and fortune skills, and their companion form was Heavenly Robe.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought that if the luck and good fortune of the Heavenly Robe and the Deva Asura Saber augmented him, he might be able to dodge the Calamity-grade bullets.</p>
<p>The augmentation effect of luck and fortune was weakest against large area-of-effect attacks, but from the looks of it, the Calamity-grade creature behind the door didn’t seem to have any area-of-effect attacks. If he only needed to dodge the bullets, luck and fortune were extremely useful.</p>
<p>I wonder if the Devas in the Deva Realm have any other Companion Forms. If they are in the form of gloves, hats, boots, or stuff like that, I can get a set of equipment that augments luck and good fortune. With my beloved baby tiger, I might be able to continuously dodge the Calamity-grade bullets. With this in mind, Zhou Wen felt an unbearable desire. He wished he could go to Deva Realm to farm some more Devas.</p>
<p>However, the trials in the in-game Netherworld City were too difficult. Without Li Xuan’s help, Zhou Wen could barely give the other punishments a try. The final millennium dream was just too difficult. Zhou Wen wasn’t confident.</p>
<p>Is there no other way to clear Netherworld City? Zhou Wen opened the Netherworld City dungeon and planned on studying it.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was studying Netherworld City, the various factions were analyzing the seventh shot.</p>
<p>In the past few days, no one had challenged the Venusian dimensional zone again. They were all thinking of solutions.</p>
<p>From the present situation, the dimension indeed didn’t have much control over the Cube’s operation. Otherwise, they would have definitely given the League of Guardians the green light in everything. The League of Guardians didn’t receive such preferential treatment based on the situation.</p>
<p>The various factions were also searching for the whereabouts of Looter King. They wanted to figure out who he was and if he could be used by them. If he couldn’t be used by them, it was best to eliminate him.</p>
<p>This ability to come and go freely in the Venusian dimensional zone was just too terrifying. If he could come and go to Venus, he could go anywhere on Earth.</p>
<p>With such a person around, many people couldn’t eat or sleep in peace.</p>
<p>Many commoners also discussed Looter King. Many media outlets had specially produced special videos of Looter King. They even tabulated and listed the numerous good items Looter King had picked up.</p>
<p>According to the statistics, Looter King had already picked up two Golden Battle God Companion Eggs and the skeleton’s bone. It was unknown if it was a Companion Egg or a dimensional crystal.</p>
<p>He had also picked up seven Mythical Companion Eggs, but there were even more dimensional crystals.</p>
<p>With this tabulation, many people’s eyes turned red with envy. In just a few days, the benefits obtained by Looter King had exceeded the savings of the Federation’s top experts.</p>
<p>Many people came forward to denounce Looter King, claiming that he was of reprovable character and that he shouldn’t have done such despicable things.</p>
<p>There were also experts who said that Looter King should donate the Companion Eggs he had obtained for the Federation’s research efforts. It would aid humans in conquering the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>This caused another huge debate on the Internet. Some people believed that Looter King should donate his spoils or at least cooperate with research.</p>
<p>Some people believed that they were things that Looter King had obtained with his own abilities. He had risked his life to obtain them. Why should he hand it over to the Federation?</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen occasionally paid attention to the Cube, he also saw these discussions. He had no intention of donating them at all.</p>
<p>It wasn’t entirely because he couldn’t bear to part with them. Another reason was that no one on Earth knew the Venusian dimensional zone better than him. Who could research it faster than him?</p>
<p>However, this matter gave Zhou Wen a wake-up call.</p>
<p>It’s indeed a little troublesome to grind the Deva Realm. Furthermore, there might not be a complete set of gloves, boots, and other equipment. Instead of going through so much trouble, why don’t I try to purchase Companion Beasts with luck and good fortune traits? Zhou Wen only had an idea, but he didn’t know how to go about doing it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, luck and good fortune were rare abilities. Even an Epic Lucky Baby Tiger could be sold for an astronomical price. Mythical and Terror-grade ones were even more priceless. Even if others had them, they might not be willing to exchange them for something else.</p>
<p>He couldn’t think of a good way to complete the trade for the time being. All he could do was continue seeking a way to clear Netherworld City. At the same time, he waited for the Venusian instance dungeon to refresh or for other creatures to rush into the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>For two consecutive days, no creature entered the Venusian dimensional zone. Zhou Wen farmed the Venus instance dungeon twice. Each time, Grim Reaper No. 10 died at the seventh shot.</p>
<p>Even if the other Companion Beasts were to block the first few shots for it, Grim Reaper No. 10 would still die when it took the seventh shot.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen made another attempt. If he could stall for time and last out the seventh shot and let Grim Reaper No. 10 take the hit from the eighth shot, would something special happen?</p>
<p>With this attempt, Zhou Wen discovered a problem.</p>
<p>After outlasting the first seven bullets, the eighth bullet failed to kill Grim Reaper No. 10. Grim Reaper No. 10 died at the seventh shot during a new round of firing.</p>
<p>As for Deva Asura’s dodging ability, its effectiveness was variable. It wasn’t very reliable.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, only the seventh shot in every round is fatal to Grim Reaper No. 10. As long as I can hold out, Grim Reaper No. 10 can actually last a long time… Zhou Wen immediately saw hope of clearing the dungeon.</p>
<p>Although it hadn’t been verified, it was theoretically feasible. Now, Zhou Wen still had a problem to resolve.</p>
<p>Just holding out wasn’t enough. He had to rush in and find the dimensional creature inside. Only by finding it could he kill it. Otherwise, it would be useless no matter how long he held on.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried teleporting to the door that shot out the bullets, but he didn’t see the dimensional creature inside. The bullets shot out from the other doors and killed the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>After trying several methods, he still failed to find the dimensional creature.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1232'>Chapter 1232: One Step Ahead</h3>
<p>After a few days, another creature challenged the Venusian dimensional zone. However, no human had seen this creature before. It had never appeared around the Venusian dimensional zone when the latter was first born.</p>
<p>The creature looked like a huge turtle. Its shell was more than three meters in diameter and its body was crystalline like jade.</p>
<p>However, its head was like a dragon. It had horns and whiskers, but it couldn’t shrink back into its shell.</p>
<p>As no one knew where this dimensional creature came from, the attention on it increased. However, more people wanted to know if Looter King would come in to loot again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what level the turtle was and didn’t dare rashly enter.</p>
<p>He wasn’t in a rush. It wouldn’t be too late to enter after the huge turtle killed the Golden Battle Gods. His life was still the most important thing.</p>
<p>After the huge turtle entered the Venusian dimensional zone, the Metal Guard launched an attack. However, when the bullets struck the huge turtle’s body, not only did they fail to injure it, the bullets even bounced back and penetrated the Metal Guard’s body.</p>
<p>Originally, these metal bullets couldn’t injure the Metal Guard, but from ricocheting from the huge turtle, the bullets seemed to be augmented with some strange power that killed the Metal Guard.</p>
<p>Numerous Metal Guards rushed out and swept at the huge turtle with their submachine guns. The bullets failed to injure the huge turtle at all. The ricocheting bullets killed all of them.</p>
<p>“What a powerful ricocheting ability!” Everyone was surprised.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu and Zhang Yuzhi were watching the live broadcast together. Zhang Yuzhi’s gaze was fixed on the huge turtle as he frowned as though he was thinking about something.</p>
<p>“This turtle looks a little familiar,” Zhang Yuzhi said after watching for a while.</p>
<p>When Zhang Chunqiu heard that, he said, “In ancient times, there was a Dragon Turtle. Legend has it that it was the son of the Dragon God. It carried the Chart of the Yellow River and Writ of the Luo River and appeared in the world, illustrating the cosmos and gave clues for its ordering. It possesses infinite mystery.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. I was wondering why it looked so familiar. The Dragon Turtle looks very similar to the pictures in the library at home.” Zhang Yuzhi thought for a moment and said, “If this is really a Dragon Turtle, then it’s a creature from Earth?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps, perhaps not. Who knows?” Zhang Chunqiu said meaningfully.</p>
<p>The Golden Battle God appeared, but his bullet also ricocheted from the Dragon Turtle. A dimensional crystal dropped—a skill crystal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that the huge turtle didn’t seem to have any intention of taking the initiative to attack others or pick up the items on the ground. Without any hesitation, he teleported to Venus and headed for the dimensional zone, planning on picking up the items.</p>
<p>To his surprise, just as Zhou Wen teleported into the room, he realized that a figure had already picked up the Golden Battle God’s dimensional crystal on the ground.</p>
<p>On careful look, it was a person wearing Astral Armor. He looked familiar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and immediately recalled that this person had previously participated in the ranking battle of the Cube. He was one of the earlier batch of Guardians, and his strength back then was rather impressive.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t participate in the battle much. Zhou Wen hadn’t paid much attention to him either. He couldn’t even remember his name, but he remembered the person.</p>
<p>At that moment, the people watching the livestream saw that Looter King had been beaten to the chase by someone else. Some gloated, while others watched with relish. There were also people who looked forward to their fight.</p>
<p>“Sorry, you’re late.” The person put away the skill crystal and picked up the other crystals on the ground.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t slow either. Seeing that the huge turtle had no intention of attacking them, he quickly snatched the dimensional crystals on the ground.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was surprised to discover that the other party’s teleportation was faster than his. Every time he phased into existence after teleportation, the other party would have already snatched the dimensional crystal.</p>
<p>However, this way, Zhou Wen immediately discovered the other party’s identity.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Zhou Wen’s judgment was strong, but that he had cultivated the other party’s Essence Energy Art before. The direction the other party cultivated was somewhat different from his. However, their foundations were the same, so it was very easy to tell.</p>
<p>Unless there’s a third person in the world who cultivates the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art, this fellow is undoubtedly Eldest Senior Brother Liu Yun. Zhou Wen sized up the person and thought to himself, This fellow seems more well-rounded despite us cultivating the same Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had always taken the path of a grand universe for the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art. It allowed him to continuously teleport in a short period of time apart from a lack of accuracy.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s interstellar teleportation ability was relatively weaker, but it was more accurate than Zhou Wen’s. It could also be used for short-distance teleportation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hadn’t developed the potential of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art in this aspect. Instead, he had replaced it with the ability of the Godfiend Era. One focused on short range, while the other focused on interstellar teleportation. They went to two extremes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen learned too many things. He wasn’t as focused on the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art as Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“I’m really sorry. From the looks of it, I’ve made you come here for nothing.” Liu Yun was extremely smug as he didn’t forget to tease Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen had used the Godfiend Era when he teleported, Liu Yun didn’t realize that Looter King was Zhou Wen. He was feeling smug that he had stolen Looter King’s limelight in front of all of humanity.</p>
<p>“You may live to snatch it, but you need to leave alive,” Zhou Wen deliberately changed his voice.</p>
<p>“You can scare others, but you can’t scare me, the Thief Sage.” Liu Yun first reported his name before continuing, “I’ve already observed and understood that as long as you don’t use the Cube to teleport over and don’t enter the Venusian dimensional zone through the main entrance, you can teleport out at any time, right?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He wasn’t surprised that Liu Yun could guess the truth, but he was somewhat puzzled. He didn’t know why Liu Yun had said it in front of all the Earthlings. It looked like he had done it on purpose.</p>
<p>With Liu Yun’s greed, there was no reason for him not to secretly plunder the fortune and expose this secret.</p>
<p>“That’s if you can leave alive,” Zhou Wen repeated coldly as he held the Asura Saber in his hand.</p>
<p>“I’m so afraid!” Liu Yun patted his chest as though he was a fearful little child, but his eyes were filled with mockery.</p>
<p>Without a word, Zhou Wen slashed at Liu Yun. He didn’t really want to kill Liu Yun to snatch the dimensional crystal back, but he wanted to see how strong Liu Yun was.</p>
<p>Like him, Liu Yun was very good at movement techniques. Zhou Wen guessed that his movement technique wasn’t inferior to his.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, Liu Yun didn’t dodge his saber. He placed one hand behind his back as though he was invincible.</p>
<p>At the instant the Asura Saber arrived in front of him, Zhou Wen saw Liu Yun’s right hand flash as his two fingers clamped onto the blade.</p>
<p>Not good! Zhou Wen knew that it was impossible for him to use his fingers to clamp down on the Asura Saber that was slashing down. Even a peak Terror expert who specialized in physical and finger strength couldn’t do it, much less Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Even though Liu Yun’s body wasn’t strong, he still had the Star Stealer skill.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1233'>Chapter 1233: Collaboration</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen had always wanted to have Star Stealer’s skill crystal drop, but he didn’t know if he was unlucky or if the skill wasn’t fated to be his.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had never practiced Star Stealer before, he knew from past experiences that Star Stealer had a certain probability of stealing Companion Beasts. Furthermore, it was a random theft.</p>
<p>However, when he saw Liu Yun’s present state, Zhou Wen knew that something was amiss. This fellow’s Star Stealer had probably undergone a new transformation.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen instantly retracted the Asura Saber. At the same time, a Legendary Companion Beast sword that had dropped from the Ancient Sword Tomb appeared in Zhou Wen’s hand as he continued slashing. The series of actions were completed in an instant.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s fingers were fast and accurate. As he gripped the blade, Zhou Wen felt the sword in his hand disappear. Furthermore, the sword-type Companion Beast had severed its connection with Zhou Wen. Even the tattoo had vanished.</p>
<p>“Haha… You didn’t expect that, right…” Liu Yun laughed out loud as Zhou Wen’s sword was in his hand.</p>
<p>Liu Yun had been planning this for a long time. He had previously seen Zhou Wen easily slice open the Golden Battle God’s body with the Asura Saber. He knew that the Asura Saber was definitely the transformation of a Terror-grade Companion Beast. He had plotted meticulously, hoping to steal the Asura Saber while Looter King knew nothing about him.</p>
<p>Over the years, Liu Yun hadn’t been idle. Star Stealer was only a foundation, but now, he had cultivated it to an unprecedented level. He had broken through the level and ability restrictions of Star Stealer. He no longer counted on chance for stealing Companion Beasts. As long as his fingers touched a Companion Beast, he could steal it.</p>
<p>Of course, there were restrictions. Therefore, Liu Yun planned on stealing the Asura Saber while the other party didn’t know anything about him.</p>
<p>However, halfway through his laughter, Liu Yun realized that something was amiss. The weapon in his hand didn’t look like the Asura Saber, but a sword.</p>
<p>After carefully sensing it, Liu Yun immediately had the urge to vomit blood. How was this a Terror-grade Companion Beast? It was actually a Legendary sword.</p>
<p>Strange, what’s wrong with this fellow? Under such circumstances, why would he suddenly change his weapon? Could it be that he already knows about my Star Stealer’s prowess? Who is he? Liu Yun looked at Zhou Wen in surprise as he felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>The people watching the livestream didn’t have as many thoughts as Liu Yun, nor did they have such good eyesight.</p>
<p>They only saw Zhou Wen slash at Liu Yun before the saber in his hand vanished. However, Liu Yun had an additional weapon in his empty hand. They were alarmed.</p>
<p>“Thief Sage really lives up to his reputation. He actually snatched away Looter King’s weapon in battle.”</p>
<p>“That actually works? How did he do it? To be able to steal the other party’s Companion Beast, isn’t this ability too sick?”</p>
<p>“Thief Sage is too terrifying. With such an ability, wouldn’t he be able to steal from anyone? Who would dare use a Companion Beast in front of him?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Liu Yun has indeed cultivated to the point where he can steal Companion Beasts as he wishes. He’s really impressive. Zhou Wen marveled inwardly, but he didn’t stop.</p>
<p>He secretly circulated his Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping technique and instantly exchanged a Companion Beast with the sword in Liu Yun’s hand.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Liu Yun realized that the sword in his hand had suddenly become another sword. He immediately realized that something was amiss and threw the sword out.</p>
<p>The sword exploded in midair, sending Liu Yun flying with a tragic cry.</p>
<p>When people realized what was happening, they realized that Liu Yun, who had been blasted away, had vanished. When they looked at Looter King again, he was gone. Only the huge turtle was still fighting the Golden Battle God.</p>
<p>On Venus, two figures constantly blinked in and out of existence. Soon, they left the Venusian instance dungeon and arrived at a rift valley.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, how have you been?” Liu Yun had already guessed who Zhou Wen was. Although half of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping technique was the Godfiend Era’s power, half of it was the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art’s power.</p>
<p>“Give it back,” Zhou Wen said as he extended his hand.</p>
<p>Liu Yun said seriously, “Junior Brother, these dimensional crystals are limited in value. I have a big transaction that might interest you. If we succeed, the benefits we can obtain will be far more than just a few dimensional crystals.”</p>
<p>“What big transaction?” Zhou Wen knew that this fellow definitely had some plans. Otherwise, why would he expose the secret of entering and exiting the Venusian dimensional zone for no reason?</p>
<p>Liu Yun chuckled and said, “We definitely can’t defeat the Calamity-grade creature. No matter how many spoils you loot, you can only pick up the Golden Battle God Companion Eggs. You were already very lucky to have picked up two Golden Battle God Companion Eggs. The chances of you picking up Companion Eggs in the future will only drop.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally knew that the first dimensional creature to appear in a dimensional zone had a much higher chance of dropping a Companion Egg. The more he killed, the lower the drop rate.</p>
<p>“I’ve revealed the secret of entering and exiting the Venusian dimensional zone. The League of Guardians and the various factions will definitely not be able to hold back and attempt to conquer the Venusian dimensional zone. At the very least, they will want to kill the Golden Battle Gods first. When the time comes, we can mug them. The benefits we can obtain will be much better than having a Companion Egg drop,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“What if they refuse to give in? We can’t just kill them all, right? I don’t want to be enemies with the entire world,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“It’s fine if they don’t offer them up. There’s still me,” Liu Yun said with a nasty smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he realized that Liu Yun was carrying out the theft openly.</p>
<p>“If the League of Guardians were to come, there would definitely be more than one or two. Would you be able to gain an advantage from them?” Zhou Wen sized up Liu Yun. He didn’t believe that Liu Yun had the ability to fight a crowd alone and rob the fellows from the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>Cave Era, Hermit, Great Skyfiend, and Blood Shaman were not people to be trifled with.</p>
<p>“That’s why I originally wanted to find an opportunity to make a single heist, but since you’re here, we can do a bigger one. How about it? Do you want to work together and do something big?” Liu Yun continued trying to rope Zhou Wen in.</p>
<p>“Sure, but I’ll determine who we are mugging.” Zhou Wen naturally didn’t care about benevolence or morality when it came to the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>“Alright, no problem. I’ll be under your command. How about 50-50 after the matter is done?” Liu Yun said.</p>
<p>“Sure. Return the dimensional crystals you just took.” Zhou Wen felt that this was something doable, so he discussed the details with Liu Yun.</p>
<p>The risk wasn’t high. After all, the two humans who were best at spatial dimension were here. Although there were other spatial experts, there weren’t many who were stronger than them. Even if the heist failed, it wouldn’t be a problem for the two of them to escape with their lives.</p>
<p>As the two of them were discussing, the huge turtle had already ricocheted the bullets of the six Golden Battle Gods, killing them. No bullets of any attribute could injure it at all.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1234'>Chapter 1234: Greed</h3>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The gunshot was deafening. It was somewhat different from the usual gunshots.</p>
<p>In the past, the bullets that flew out of the door destroyed everything with one shot. Even Grim Reaper No. 10 could only revive after being killed.</p>
<p>However, this time, the bullet that flew out of the door failed to penetrate the huge turtle’s body. A metal bullet struck the spot between the huge turtle’s eyebrows, but only appeared as though it had been embedded in a steel plate. The entire bullet didn’t penetrate its flesh. One could see that the end of the bullet was red metal, but it was impossible to see the complete appearance of the bullet.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, it actually failed to penetrate!” Everyone looked at the huge turtle in disbelief.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>One gunshot after another rang out as they struck different spots on the huge turtle’s body. Every bullet was embedded in its body, but they failed to penetrate its body or kill it.</p>
<p>The huge turtle wasn’t able to send the bullets ricocheting either. It only walked towards the door while taking the bullets head on.</p>
<p>“That turtle isn’t a Calamity-grade creature, right?”</p>
<p>“It looks very strong, but it doesn’t seem to have a Calamity Zone.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps it’s just not using it. Look at the creature behind the door. It isn’t using a domain either.”</p>
<p>Everyone discussed spiritedly as Zhou Wen wore a look of surprise. He was also watching this battle, and it was right outside the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>It was very difficult to see directly into the dimensional zone from the outside. Zhou Wen was somewhat envious that Liu Yun had obtained a mirror from somewhere that could project the scenes from inside the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>However, with this mirror, it saved him a lot of trouble. Zhou Wen didn’t need to return to Earth to use the Cube to watch the battle inside.</p>
<p>“This Dragon Turtle’s carapace is so hard. It has already blocked six consecutive shots. I wonder if it can block the seventh shot?” Liu Yun said in surprise as he looked at the projection in the mirror.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, that turtle should be at the Calamity grade. Furthermore, it’s a defensive one. However, it’s still hard to tell if it can withstand the seventh shot. This is the shield and spear paradox. It depends on who’s stronger.” Although Zhou Wen said that, he was thinking of another problem.</p>
<p>This turtle was most likely a Calamity-grade creature. If it was killed inside, it was unknown if a Companion Egg or dimensional fruit would drop.</p>
<p>If something dropped, it would be too tempting.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had never touched a Calamity-grade Companion Egg before.</p>
<p>Although Truth Listener could barely enter the Calamity grade, the price it had to pay was too great. Zhou Wen didn’t want to do things to repeat itself, considering how he needed Wang Mingyuan’s help to get Truth Listener under control again.</p>
<p>The Venusian instance dungeon was clearly different from the dungeons on Earth. Any creature that entered the dungeon could drop a Companion Egg. The huge turtle was probably no exception.</p>
<p>However, even if a Companion Egg dropped, it was still a question whether he dared to take it.</p>
<p>If he entered without any cover, he might suffer a head shot.</p>
<p>Many powerful creatures on Earth were also watching the seventh shot.</p>
<p>“What a pity.” In a cave on Chess Mountain, a chained woman was watching the live broadcast. She looked at the huge turtle with a look of pity and muttered to herself, “Such a rare creature has to die not long after being born. If it had time to continue growing, I’m afraid the Venusian dimensional zone wouldn’t be able to stop it.”</p>
<p>Under the attention of everyone, the fatal seventh shot finally sounded. This shot that could even kill Grim Reaper No. 10 struck the huge turtle’s neck with a bang.</p>
<p>This shot wasn’t aimed at its head. When the bullet struck the huge turtle’s neck, it was as though it had hit a steel plate, producing a plethora of sparks.</p>
<p>However, in the midst of the sparks and flashes, the bullet slammed into the huge turtle’s body and drilled into its shell. In the next instant, it drilled out from behind its body with sparks.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The huge turtle’s body fell to the ground as turtle blood immediately gushed out from the two gun wounds like spring water.</p>
<p>“Even a Calamity-grade can’t block that shot!” Everyone was alarmed as a chill arose in their hearts.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Liu Yun exchanged looks and saw the greed in each other’s eyes. They had thought of the same thing.</p>
<p>Although the huge turtle looked like it was about to die, it wasn’t completely dead. It still had a breath of life left. To be able to withstand a terrifying Calamity-grade attack without being directly killed, the huge turtle’s identity as a Calamity-grade could basically be confirmed.</p>
<p>If a Companion Egg really dropped, they were considering taking the risk to snatch it.</p>
<p>The huge turtle struggled to get up, but after struggling a few times, it fell to the ground again. More and more turtle blood flowed out. It was unlikely to live. Death was only a matter of time.</p>
<p>The creature behind the door seemed to know that huge turtle wouldn’t survive, so it didn’t continue shooting. This left Zhou Wen alarmed.</p>
<p>In-game, the creature would continue shooting until the enemy was completely dead.</p>
<p>However, in reality, the other party would stop firing. This action appeared very intelligent. The huge turtle was doomed, so there was no need for him to fire another shot.</p>
<p>If he fired another shot, it would expose the fact that only his seventh shot was fatal, making it easier for others to deal with him.</p>
<p>After all, he’s a creature in real life. It’s understandable that he has high intelligence. He’s not as inflexible as in-game, but this makes it even more difficult to kill him. Furthermore, the method I previously thought of might not work against him. Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>In-game, this creature first fought the creature with the highest level. Therefore, as long as there was a Terror-grade present, it wouldn’t target a human with a Mythical body like Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, in reality, the other party had high intelligence. He would definitely be able to tell his importance. When the time came, he would be doomed if he was first targeted.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was thinking, the turtle struggled to crawl towards the door, leaving a long trail of blood on the ground. The blood in its body was almost drained.</p>
<p>There was still some distance from the door. The huge turtle looked like it was on its last breath and couldn’t crawl further.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the huge turtle that looked like it could no longer move raised its head as though it experienced a spurt of strength in its final moments of life, giving everyone watching a fright.</p>
<p>In the next second, the huge turtle’s actions gave everyone a shock. It opened its dragon mouth and spat out something. After the thing spewed out, all of the huge turtle’s essence, vitality, and spirit dissipated. Its final breath was taken as it collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p>Most people’s eyes were attracted by the thing that the huge turtle spewed out. It was a round jade ball the size of a soccer ball. The jade ball was milky-white and translucent. There seemed to be clouds flowing and churning inside. It looked magical.</p>
<p>That thing… Don’t tell me it’s a Companion Egg… Zhou Wen and Liu Yun exchanged looks. Almost at the same time, the two of them teleported into the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>A Calamity-grade Companion Egg was something that could drive anyone crazy.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1235'>Chapter 1235: Fighting for the Jade Ball</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>The moment Zhou Wen appeared in the room, he locked onto the soccer-sized jade ball and reached out to grab it.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s speed wasn’t slower than Zhou Wen’s. He also extended his hand to grab the jade ball. Their fingers touched it almost at the same time.</p>
<p>The spectators were alarmed when they saw that Looter King and Thief Sage had appeared to snatch the jade ball simultaneously.</p>
<p>They shared the same thoughts as Zhou Wen and Liu Yun. They felt that the jade ball was very likely a Dragon Turtle Companion Egg. If they could really get it, its value was inestimable.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw Liu Yun touch the jade ball, he suddenly sucked at it, hoping to pull it over.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Liu Yun had the same thought.. The two of them sucked hard at the same time, but they failed to pull the jade ball towards them.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, Zhou Wen’s Asura Saber and Liu Yun’s dagger slashed at each other, hoping to force the other party back, but they only managed to collide.</p>
<p>With this collision, the two of them exerted too much force. The terrifying force forced the two of them to retreat as their fingers left the jade ball.</p>
<p>Seeing the jade ball fly out again, everyone’s hearts rose to their throats as their gazes involuntarily followed the jade ball.</p>
<p>However, in the next moment, everyone felt their vision blur. The jade ball had somehow landed in Liu Yun’s hand.</p>
<p>“As expected of the Thief Sage. His hands are just too fast,” Zhang Chunqiu exclaimed. With his eyesight, he failed to see how Liu Yun had taken the jade ball.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>A gunshot sounded as Liu Yun’s head exploded after obtaining the jade ball. The Guardian armor on his body was like paper—completely useless.</p>
<p>However, a strange scene happened. Liu Yun, whose head had exploded, turned into quicksand and scattered on the ground. Another Liu Yun held the jade ball and vanished in the blink of an eye. He had likely teleported out of the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Everyone was dumbfounded. This series of actions left everyone flabbergasted. Before anyone could react, Liu Yun had already left with the jade ball.</p>
<p>When they turned to look at Looter King, he was nowhere to be seen. Furthermore, the live broadcast of the Cube had stopped and returned to the scene outside the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the Dragon Turtle was already dead.</p>
<p>“As expected of the Thief Sage. He’s too awesome. His hands are so fast that it makes one’s hair stand on end. I didn’t see how he took the Companion Egg.”</p>
<p>“If you could see it, would he still be called the Thief Sage?”</p>
<p>“Thief Sage is really impressive. That’s a Calamity-grade Companion Egg!”</p>
<p>“If he really hatches it, won’t he be invincible?”</p>
<p>“How can a Calamity-grade Companion Egg be hatched so easily? If he’s not careful, he might even lose his life.”</p>
<p>“That’s true. If the Thief Sage can’t hatch it in a short period of time, I’m afraid he will encounter grave danger.”</p>
<p>“Hehe, I reckon many powerful fellows have already taken action. As long as it isn’t hatched, Thief Sage won’t have a moment of peace.”</p>
<p>“It’s no longer an issue of peace. I’m just afraid he won’t live long enough to hatch the Companion Egg.”</p>
<p>In fact, just as most people guessed, many factions had already begun tracking Liu Yun’s whereabouts.</p>
<p>They knew that a Calamity-grade Companion Egg wasn’t that easy to incubate. As long as they could kill the Thief Sage before he hatched it, the Companion Egg would be theirs.</p>
<p>Who wouldn’t be tempted by a Calamity-grade Companion Egg? Even in the dimension, a Calamity-grade was already an overlord. Apart from Human Sovereign, they had never heard of a second human possessing a Calamity-grade Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Liu Yun wasn’t stupid. Therefore, he immediately used interstellar teleportation to leave Venus. After returning to Earth, he plunged into an uninhabited desert.</p>
<p>At that moment, Liu Yun was extremely excited. That was a Calamity-grade Companion Egg. As long as he could hatch it, he, Liu Yun, would be a virtually invincible existence on Earth. The League of Guardians and the Holy Spirit Association had nothing on him.</p>
<p>As for the agreement with Zhou Wen, Liu Yun threw it out. He definitely couldn’t let Zhou Wen have any chance of coming into contact with such a good item.</p>
<p>When I, Liu Yun, appear again, it will be time to change the world. Liu Yun also knew that this wasn’t the time to be happy. He had to quickly escape to a safe place.</p>
<p>The temptation of a Calamity-grade Companion Egg was just too great. It was likely that the League of Guardians and the Holy Spirit Association had already taken action. Even the six families might have sent people to snatch the Companion Egg from him. He had to find a safe place to think of a way to hatch it.</p>
<p>What kind of Companion Beast will it be? From the looks of the dragon carapace, it should be armor, right? Liu Yun was already imagining himself wearing the Dragon Turtle armor and facing the experts who came to hunt him. He would stand steadfast with his hands behind his back. No matter if they hit him until exhaustion, they couldn’t injure him at all. Instead, he would rebound any force directed at him back at them until they were dead.</p>
<p>“I really do live up to the nickname ‘Thief Sage.’ In the future, when I wear the Calamity armor to mug others, they will obediently hand over their spoils to me. Would I need to be sneaky? As a thief, I should have the demeanor of a thief. I’m a role model among thieves. I’m a gentleman among thieves, the elegant and charming Thief Sage…” Liu Yun was about to drool. He imagined the scene of thousands of beautiful girls falling for him in the future. He could make those beautiful girls faint from excitement with just a look.</p>
<p>“With a pet in hand, the world is my… my… my…” Liu Yun subconsciously touched the jade ball in his arms. With this touch, his expression changed drastically as he stuttered.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? Why did it turn into stone?” Liu Yun threw the stone ball in his arms to the ground.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>The stone ball shattered the moment it landed. It was clearly an ordinary stone—not a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>“What’s this? Where’s my Companion Egg? Where’s my ball?” Liu Yun was dumbfounded when he saw the shattered stone ball.</p>
<p>Soon, Liu Yun came to a realization and immediately knew what had happened.</p>
<p>“That bastard Zhou Wen tricked me again!” An extremely furious roar sounded in the wilderness, scaring the surrounding animals into retreating. The wild birds scattered in all directions.</p>
<p>He had paid such a huge price to use the only Quicksand Substitute he had, but he ended up with this crap.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also returned to Earth with a ball in his arms. It was the jade ball spat out by the Dragon Turtle.</p>
<p>When he first touched the jade ball, he had already left a mark on it. The reason he didn’t use Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping to retrieve it immediately was that he wanted Liu Yun to take it away. He was afraid that the dimensional creatures behind the door would target the person who obtained the jade ball first. The outcome was as he had expected. Liu Yun was first to be hit.</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother, Eldest Senior Brother, you were the one who wanted to vie for it with me. You can’t blame me.” Zhou Wen hugged the jade ball and found it more and more pleasing to the eye. He was just short of kissing it.</p>
<p>This was a Calamity-grade treasure. Perhaps he would have a true Calamity-grade Companion Beast soon, not a disobedient defective creature like Truth Listener.</p>
<p>“Come on, baby. Let me see your stats.” Zhou Wen took out his phone and snapped a picture of the jade ball.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1236'>Chapter 1236: Strange Jade Ball</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Eh, what’s going on? Zhou Wen held his phone and aimed it at the jade ball. He aimed the camera from every angle, but his phone didn’t react at all.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately realized that something was amiss. If it was a Companion Egg, the phone would definitely have reacted. It should be able to be stored in-game.</p>
<p>Now that there was no reaction from the phone, there was only one possibility—this thing wasn’t a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>No way? Zhou Wen looked at the jade ball gloomily. He had taken such a huge risk and taken so much effort to obtain it, but it wasn’t a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>What is this? Since it was spat out by the Calamity-grade Dragon Turtle before it died, even if it’s not a Companion Egg, it should be something good, right? Zhou Wen carefully studied it for a while but failed to figure it out.</p>
<p>This thing looked like a ball both from afar and up close.. Even after fiddling with it for a long time, it remained a ball.</p>
<p>It didn’t have the ability to release energy, nor was there any special reaction. It was like a dead object.</p>
<p>Could this be a gallstone from the Dragon Turtle’s stomach? It was stuck in its throat before it died, so it spat it out? Zhou Wen wore an odd expression. He was already beginning to wonder if the jade ball was of any use.</p>
<p>Looking around, he realized that he was in a mountainous area. There were no creatures around, so he released Ice Maiden, Jade Rabbit, Demonic Neonate, and company.</p>
<p>“Ice Maiden, take a look at this,” Zhou Wen pointed at the jade ball.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden glanced at the jade ball on the ground, but she ignored Zhou Wen. She looked as though she didn’t want to bother with him. It was unknown if she recognized it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that Ice Maiden was pissed. She had been trapped for five years and hadn’t had a chance to come out until recently. If it were Zhou Wen, he would definitely be extremely pissed as well.</p>
<p>“Don’t you want to see the Demon God Bloodline Catalog? I can tell you where it is.” Zhou Wen threw out a bait.</p>
<p>“Do you think I’ll still believe you?” Ice Maiden curled her lips and said disdainfully.</p>
<p>“I’ve always kept my word. I could do nothing about it since I was trapped for five years.” Zhou Wen paused before saying, “To show my sincerity, I can tell you that the Demon God Bloodline Catalog is in Chess Mountain. If you are confident, you can enter the mountain to take a look now.”</p>
<p>“Chess Mountain? You aren’t lying to me?” Ice Maiden sized up Zhou Wen suspiciously.</p>
<p>Although she had been enslaved by Zhou Wen ever since she came to Earth, she hadn’t been idle. She had used a phone and the Internet to gain a good understanding of Earth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had mentioned Chess Mountain many times. Ice Maiden had a vague sense that Zhou Wen was afraid of it.</p>
<p>A place that made Zhou Wen’s expression change was definitely abnormally dangerous.</p>
<p>“The reason I didn’t tell you in the past is that it’s too dangerous there. Even if you are at the Terror grade, there’s not much chance of you seeing the Demon God Bloodline Catalog alive. Therefore, I thought of taking you there only when I have the strength…” Zhou Wen comforted Ice Maiden.</p>
<p>Although Ice Maiden didn’t believe Zhou Wen’s words, she still glanced at the jade ball in his hand and said, “It’s useless no matter what you say now. I don’t know what it is.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly disappointed. If even Ice Maiden didn’t know what it was, it would be difficult to identify it.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I’ll keep my word. When I have the strength to enter Chess Mountain, I’ll definitely take you to see the Demon God Bloodline Catalog,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“What’s inside Chess Mountain?” Ice Maiden pressed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen told Ice Maiden some of The Thearch’s deeds. As he was speaking the truth, Ice Maiden knew that Zhou Wen wasn’t lying after listening to him. Some things weren’t something humans at Zhou Wen’s level could know. He had definitely seen them before.</p>
<p>“You said that The Thearch can use the power of wishes to change your body thousands of kilometers away and turn you into another species?” Ice Maiden asked Zhou Wen in shock.</p>
<p>“That’s right. It completely transformed me into another creature. I didn’t have any strength left,” Zhou Wen said with a nod.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden fell silent. After a while, she said, “If it’s really as you said, I’m afraid it’s impossible for us to storm in to take a look at the Demon God Bloodline Catalog.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked as he had some guesses.</p>
<p>“If The Thearch really possesses that power, even the kings of the Octokind might not be able to benefit in there, much less us,” Ice Maiden said with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>“Are you saying that The Thearch might be at the Apocalypse grade?” Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed.</p>
<p>He originally guessed that The Thearch might be at the peak of the Calamity grade. It was unlikely for an Apocalypse grade to appear on Earth.</p>
<p>However, from Ice Maiden’s expression, she seemed to think so.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden shook her head slightly. “It’s hard to say, but creatures with that kind of power are definitely not ordinary Calamity-grade creatures.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Ice Maiden said, “Is there no other way to enter Chess Mountain?”</p>
<p>“I have no other methods now,” Zhou Wen said as he spread out his hands.</p>
<p>Seeing that Ice Maiden didn’t seem to know what the jade ball was, Zhou Wen got Demonic Neonate to summon Grim Demon.</p>
<p>“Old Grim, do you know what this is?” Zhou Wen pointed at the jade ball and asked Grim Demon.</p>
<p>Grim Demon looked it over and finally shook his head. “I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Do you think this might be a Companion Egg?” Zhou Wen asked again, unwilling to give up.</p>
<p>“Are you crazy? How can such a stone be a Companion Egg?” Grim Demon looked at Zhou Wen as though he was a lunatic who was crazy about riches.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was greatly disappointed. This thing didn’t seem to be as valuable as he imagined.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate wasn’t interested in the jade ball, nor did Jade Rabbit react. Some of the main Companion Beasts didn’t have any special reaction to the jade ball.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t give up. He summoned the Companion Beasts he seldom used to see if there was any reaction to the jade ball.</p>
<p>This was a last-ditch effort. These Companion Beasts basically didn’t have any Evolvable attributes, nor did they need to eat. Even the evolvable Companion Beasts didn’t react, so how could they react?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned even the Seven Seas Dragon King, but there was still no reaction. It was as though the jade ball was really useless.</p>
<p>At this point, Zhou Wen had already given up. He planned on storing the jade ball in the Chaos Bead as a possible trump card for the future.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, the summoned Galaxy Shell Dragon suddenly arrived in front of the jade ball. Its lobster-like body bent down and hugged the jade ball with its many tiny claws. Its body curled up into a ball and wrapped the jade ball tightly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1237'>Chapter 1237: Assassination</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>The way it hugged the ball reminded Zhou Wen of the shrimp ball meal during Ouyang Lan’s treat.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Shell Dragon held the jade ball motionless as though it was dead. When Zhou Wen summoned it, it didn’t respond.</p>
<p>Seeing the Galaxy Shell Dragon in such a state, Zhou Wen decided to put it into the Chaos Bead.</p>
<p>In any case, I don’t know what use that jade ball has. If the Galaxy Shell Dragon can evolve once, it will be quite worth it. Zhou Wen thought to himself that if the Galaxy Shell Dragon could advance to the Calamity grade, he would have made a killing.</p>
<p>Although the Galaxy Shell Dragon wasn’t as powerful as the Dragon Turtle, its Absolute Defense was also a very powerful Wheel of Destiny. If its level increased, it would be a very powerful aid.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also knew that it wouldn’t be easy to advance to the Calamity grade..</p>
<p>However, if it could advance to the Terror grade, it would become very useful. If it could constantly activate Absolute Defense, its defense would be so strong that it should be ranked at the top of the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked into the Chaos Bead again and saw that the Galaxy Shell Dragon was hugging the jade ball as though it was dead. There was still no movement or any special changes. It was unknown if it was evolving.</p>
<p>Seeing that the situation wouldn’t change anytime soon, Zhou Wen decided to ignore it. He first found a place with a phone signal to study the situation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately amused.</p>
<p>Liu Yun had now become a rat that everyone was hunting. All the major factions were searching for his whereabouts. There were even people who publicly posted a bounty on the Internet. Those who could provide clues about Thief Sage could obtain an Epic Companion Egg. If they could lead them to Thief Sage, they could even obtain a Mythical Companion Egg.</p>
<p>This was only the provisions of clues that didn’t require the informant to take any risks. The generosity of the rewards made it obvious how tempting the Calamity-grade Companion Egg was.</p>
<p>The entire population on Earth was probably looking for Liu Yun. If he wasn’t careful, Thief Sage’s reputation would be ruined. He might even die.</p>
<p>This was something Zhou Wen hadn’t expected. However, Liu Yun had already advanced to the Terror grade and was good at spatial teleportation. It wouldn’t be easy to capture him.</p>
<p>As long as he hid in the Endless Sea of Stars, few people would be able to find him.</p>
<p>When can I learn Eldest Senior Brother’s Star Stealer move? It’d be really useful. Zhou Wen was somewhat helpless as he couldn’t get the Star Stealer’s skill crystal to drop.</p>
<p>Even if it dropped, Star Stealer’s skill level wasn’t high. It wasn’t easy to cultivate it to Liu Yun’s level.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In the An family’s old residence, Ya’er was squatting in the garden with her head lowered as she watched ants shuttling through the grass.</p>
<p>“Miss Ya’er, Overseer wants me to take you to eat something delicious,” a person in officer attire came to Ya’er’s side and said with a smile.</p>
<p>Ya’er ignored the officer and didn’t even raise her head. She continued looking at the ants on the ground.</p>
<p>“Miss Ya’er, let’s leave now. Don’t make Overseer wait any longer,” the officer urged again.</p>
<p>Only then did Ya’er stand up and turn to size up the officer.</p>
<p>The officer smiled and said, “Overseer has prepared a lot of delicious food for you. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“You’re lying,” Ya’er said slowly.</p>
<p>The officer’s expression changed slightly, but he immediately returned to normal. He said with a smile, “Miss Ya’er, stop joking. Overseer is still waiting for you.”</p>
<p>However, Ya’er said calmly, “Uncle will either deliver the items here or take me there himself. He won’t let anyone else do it for him, much less a stranger I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“I’m the Overseer’s staff officer. Deputy An happened to have something on today, so he got me to pick you up,” the officer explained.</p>
<p>“That’s even more impossible. If you were really sent by Uncle, you should know that Uncle never rushes me. He will wait quietly until I decide to go,” Ya’er said.</p>
<p>The officer’s expression turned nasty, but he still forced a smile and explained, “I already said that today is a special situation. Overseer still has an important meeting later. Time is tight…”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, Uncle wouldn’t have let you come. He’s the kind of person who’s gentle enough to tolerate everything, but he won’t make things difficult for others,” Ya’er said.</p>
<p>The officer was already somewhat flustered. He didn’t have that much time. While An Tianzuo and An Sheng were out and Ouyang Lan wasn’t at home, he had to take Ya’er with him. He couldn’t wait any longer.</p>
<p>Gritting his teeth, the officer reached out to grab Ya’er’s arm, hoping to abduct her.</p>
<p>However, just as the officer’s hand moved, he heard a gunshot. His arm was penetrated and blood spewed out.</p>
<p>The officer held his wound and turned his head. The color in his face immediately drained.</p>
<p>He saw the slender An Tianzuo standing at the entrance of the garden. He was wearing a military uniform and a military coat. He held a pistol in his hand and smoke was coming out of the muzzle as he looked at him coldly.</p>
<p>“Over… Overseer…” The officer’s legs were trembling as though all his strength had vanished. He couldn’t even stand properly.</p>
<p>“Why?” An Tianzuo asked the officer.</p>
<p>“Overseer, I’m sorry. I was forced into a corner. If I wasn’t at my wits’ end, I wouldn’t have done anything to let you down… Please give me another chance on account of me risking my life for you in the past.” The officer plopped to his knees.</p>
<p>“Will you live if I spare you?” An Tianzuo said expressionlessly.</p>
<p>The officer immediately froze. If he was forced into a corner, he would die even if An Tianzuo spared him.</p>
<p>If An Tianzuo spared him, he might still have a way out that meant that he wasn’t forced into a corner.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo walked towards Ya’er. When he passed the officer, he placed the gun in his hand and said indifferently, “It’s up to you whether you live or die.” Then, he continued walking towards Ya’er.</p>
<p>The officer raised his gun and aimed it at his head, but at the instant he pulled the trigger, he aimed the gun at An Tianzuo’s back.</p>
<p>Pa! Pa! Pa!</p>
<p>The officer fired three times in a row, but the gun didn’t sound. There was only the sound of the hammer hitting. The gun wasn’t loaded.</p>
<p>At that instant, the officer’s face was filled with shock, puzzlement, embarrassment, and other complicated expressions.</p>
<p>Without looking back, An Tianzuo gently carried Ya’er and turned to walk towards the garden gate.</p>
<p>After walking past the officer, An Tianzuo said indifferently, “You’ve been with me for so long. When have you seen me let Ya’er see blood?”</p>
<p>The officer froze. His body and lips trembled—he couldn’t even speak. He knew that he had personally given up his final chance.</p>
<p>After An Tianzuo carried Ya’er out of the garden, he cupped her ears with his black leather gloves. A gunshot sounded in the garden before everything returned to silence.</p>
<p>“How many times has this happened this month?” An Tianzuo lifted his hands from Ya’er’s ears and asked An Sheng.</p>
<p>Beside him, An Sheng answered with a helpless expression, “It’s already the eighth time, and it was also the most dangerous. I never expected that even Staff Officer Zhao, who you nurtured, would be bribed by the enemy. He even attempted to attack Ya’er. The enemy has really been unscrupulous.”</p>
<p>“It’s time to do something and let them know that I, An Tianzuo, am still alive,” An Tianzuo said as he carried Ya’er.</p>
<p>“Overseer, instruct me.” An Sheng stood up as a terrifying killing intent flashed in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Don’t give that fierce look. You will scare Ya’er,” An Tianzuo said with a smile. “Killing isn’t the goal, nor is it a necessary method. I just want them to be so sad that they can’t even cry.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1238'>Chapter 1238: Luoyang Storm</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>While everyone was hunting down Thief Sage, a piece of news that resembled the dropping of the atomic bomb suddenly broke out. The Sunset Army had captured Thief Sage and had secretly escorted him to Luoyang.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen heard the news, he couldn’t help but be taken aback as he hurriedly rushed back to Luoyang.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t have a good relationship with An Tianzuo, his father and many people close to him were in Luoyang. He couldn’t let anything happen to them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew very well how attractive a Calamity-grade Companion Egg was. Even he had rushed in despite the risk when he first discovered the jade ball.</p>
<p>Now, An Tianzuo had actually captured Liu Yun, who hadn’t obtained anything. Wasn’t he looking for trouble?</p>
<p>Countless unscrupulous people in the Federation were eyeing the jade ball that wasn’t a Calamity-grade Companion Egg. Instantly, Luoyang became the target of public scrutiny.. If it wasn’t handled well, it might even bring disaster to the An family.</p>
<p>By the time Zhou Wen rushed back to Luoyang, the situation was already very delicate. Foreigners were everywhere on the streets, but the locals were almost nowhere to be seen. The An family was being watched by countless people.</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng, what’s going on?” Zhou Wen didn’t dare ask An Sheng over the phone. After returning to Luoyang, he immediately went to see him.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, let’s talk when we get back. It’s not safe here.” An Sheng took Zhou Wen to the An family residence.</p>
<p>Along the way, many pairs of eyes were trained on them. Zhou Wen had no choice but to remain silent. When he arrived at the An family home, he realized that the entire residence had been fortified like a metal bucket. Even a mosquito wouldn’t be able to fly in.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, things are rather tricky now. There are all sorts of people outside. The factions with some level of capability have sent people to Luoyang. I’m afraid it will be very troublesome this time,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Where’s An Tianzuo?” Zhou Wen scanned the area and realized that Ouyang Lan and Ya’er were there, but there was no sign of An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Lingfeng, he had left Luoyang due to some work matters and hadn’t returned. He wasn’t in the Overseer Manor.</p>
<p>“The Overseer isn’t here,” An Sheng whispered to Zhou Wen. “As long as those fellows outside don’t see the Overseer and the thing they are looking for, they won’t dare act rashly.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t he consider the possibility that those people would threaten him with the lives of Sis Lan and you guys? Or did he think of it, but he still did it?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, Overseer is definitely not that kind of person. He has his reasons for doing so. Please believe in Overseer,” An Sheng said solemnly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was about to say something when a soldier came in to report that someone was trying to barge into Overseer Manor.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, rest now. I’ll go take a look,” An Sheng said as he stood up.</p>
<p>“I’ll go with you.” Zhou Wen was somewhat exasperated. Ya’er and Ouyang Lan were here, how could he stay out if a conflict ensued?</p>
<p>“Alright.” An Sheng laughed.</p>
<p>The two of them arrived at the door and saw a group of officials standing at the entrance. The soldiers guarding Overseer Manor aimed their guns at them.</p>
<p>Upon seeing An Sheng come out, the leader of the officials said, “Adjutant An, I’m Director Smith of the Federation’s Security Bureau. I’ve received orders from the Senate to ask Overseer An some questions. I hope you can assist in the investigations.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, Overseer isn’t in the manor. Please come again another day.” An Sheng had already dealt with many similar incidents over the past two days and casually dismissed them.</p>
<p>“I wonder when Overseer An will return?” Smith’s expression remained unchanged as he asked calmly.</p>
<p>“As subordinates, we only obey orders. How would we dare probe into matters of our superiors?” An Sheng said patronizingly.</p>
<p>“In that case, let’s wait inside for Overseer An’s return,” Smith said as he led his men into the residence.</p>
<p>The guards immediately raised their guns and undid the safety, ready to shoot at them at any moment.</p>
<p>“Mr. Smith, I’m afraid this isn’t appropriate?” An Sheng said to Smith.</p>
<p>Smith faced the black muzzles without showing any signs of panic. He remained calm as he said, “Luoyang is the Federation’s Luoyang, and Overseer An is also the Federation’s Overseer. Could it be that you will disobey the orders of the federal Senate?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, we are only soldiers. We only know how to obey our superior’s orders. The Overseer ordered us to guard Overseer Manor, so we can’t let anyone in, not even a fly. Mr. Smith, if there’s anything, please wait for the Overseer to return before discussing it with him. Don’t make things difficult for ordinary soldiers like us,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if he returns or not. This is a warrant from the Senate. Unless you wish to betray the Federation, get out of the way.” After Smith showed the warrant, he prepared to barge in.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could tell that these people were clearly forcing An Sheng and company to take action.</p>
<p>The so-called Senate was basically controlled by the League of Guardians. As for the League of Guardians, they had long viewed the An family in Luoyang as a thorn in their side. It wouldn’t be difficult for them to use this opportunity to destroy the An family.</p>
<p>After all, the An family had never accepted the olive branch extended by the League of Guardians. They even became unspoken enemies with the Guardians.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>An Sheng held the pistol and shot at Smith’s toes, causing Smith and company to pause for a moment. Then, he coldly ordered, “All soldiers, heed my command. Anyone who takes another step forward will be executed on the spot.”</p>
<p>The soldiers answered loudly without any hesitation. Their eyes were firm as their fingers were already on the trigger. They were just waiting for someone to take another step forward before they fired immediately.</p>
<p>“Everyone says that the An family is colluding with the overseas faction and wants to betray the Federation. I didn’t believe it at first, but from the looks of it, I have no choice but to believe it,” Smith said coldly.</p>
<p>An Sheng smiled and said, “Speaking of colluding with overseas, shouldn’t you investigate the League of Guardians? I hope you arrest Uesugi Nao—the famous demoness from overseas—as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>A cold glint flashed in Smith’s eyes as he stared at An Sheng and enunciated each word clearly. “The An family must be searched today. If you wish to betray the Federation, feel free to shoot.”</p>
<p>With that said, Smith led the way.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at An Sheng. This matter wasn’t an ordinary matter. It wasn’t something that could be resolved by force. Since it involved the relationship between Luoyang’s An family and the Federation, he couldn’t casually take action.</p>
<p>An Sheng seemed to be in a dilemma. Although he aimed the gun at Smith, he didn’t immediately fire.</p>
<p>“Take them all down.” A cold voice suddenly sounded. On the long street, An Tianzuo, who was dressed in a military uniform, rode a white Qilin Beast that appeared like a jade statue. Behind him were many famous generals of the Sunset Army. Even Qin Wufu was among them.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1239'>Chapter 1239: Battle of Mount Laojun</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>No one expected An Tianzuo to be so unyielding.</p>
<p>Everyone knew that Smith and company were just pawns sent by the League of Guardians to test them. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that they were cannon fodder. Touching them wouldn’t affect the League of Guardians at all, but if that happened, the An family would be charged with treason against the Federation.</p>
<p>This was clearly not worth it, but An Tianzuo didn’t hesitate to take down everyone. Those who wanted to escape were executed on the spot. Even the spies of the various families weren’t spared.</p>
<p>After that, the entire Luoyang was placed on lockdown. None of the foreigners who had come to Luoyang were able to escape. All the information networks were severed in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Instantly, Luoyang became a blind spot.. No one knew what was happening there.</p>
<p>Many people were originally wondering if An Tianzuo had really captured Thief Sage. After all, this news was too sudden, but now, these people came to a realization.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo’s actions had made it very likely that he had captured Thief Sage. He was trying to abscond.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t obtained a Calamity-grade Companion Egg, An Tianzuo wouldn’t have risked being a public enemy or be willing to bear the name of a traitor and become enemies with the entire Federation.</p>
<p>This was equivalent to committing suicide, leaving no room for negotiation. Not only would the An family not gain any benefits from this, but they would also be targeted by the entire Federation. It was possible that they would be wiped out.</p>
<p>This was practically staking his life as a bet—no one would be that foolish.</p>
<p>The only reasonable explanation was that An Tianzuo had really obtained the Calamity-grade Companion Egg, so he had gone all out. Once he hatched the Companion Egg, he could return as a king. When that happened, no one could do anything to him. He might even rule the world.</p>
<p>Hermit, who was in charge of this matter, immediately thought of this possibility. He secretly rushed to Luoyang to check on the situation and realized that the An family residence had long been emptied. Only some commoners and people from Sunset College remained in Luoyang.</p>
<p>As they had left in a hurry, many of the troops belonging to the Sunset Army hadn’t been transferred away. However, officers at the level of Qin Wufu had already vanished. No one even cared about the Essence Gold mines. They were without a leader, and Luoyang was in chaos.</p>
<p>Damn it, it’s actually real. Upon seeing this situation, it was obvious to Hermit—An Tianzuo had really obtained the Calamity-grade Companion Egg and escaped.</p>
<p>I have to find him as soon as possible. Hermit knew that it was useless even if he caught up to An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that An Tianzuo was one of the four war gods of the new era with unfathomable strength, there were also many experts of the Sunset Army and Zhou Wen around him. It was useless even if he caught up to him.</p>
<p>Hermit immediately contacted the League of Guardians headquarters. Unfortunately, Immortal wasn’t at the headquarters. Cave Era was presently in charge of the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>“Cave Era, the possibility of An Tianzuo obtaining the Dragon Turtle Companion Egg is already very high. It’s still not too late for us to chase after him.” Hermit’s meaning was obvious. He needed reinforcements.</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, Cave Era frowned and said, “What do you want to do?”</p>
<p>“I need your and Blood Shaman’s help,” Hermit said.</p>
<p>“Immortal isn’t around. I have to stay at the headquarters. It’s impossible for me to leave. Blood Shaman and Uesugi are in charge of the construction of Skysplit Tower. I can’t leave,” said Cave Era.</p>
<p>“Just leave the Skysplit Tower to Uesugi. Blood Shaman has to go. Zhou Wen has too many Companion Beasts. Together with An Tianzuo and the Sunset Army, only Blood Shaman can restrict them.”</p>
<p>Hermit paused for a moment before continuing, “The chance to obtain a Calamity-grade Companion Egg again is probably impossible. Even if we don’t snatch it, the six families won’t let it go. I believe you know the consequences of them obtaining it better than me. If the six families don’t succeed, will An Tianzuo let us off after hatching a Calamity-grade Companion Beast?”</p>
<p>“Alright, I can get Blood Shaman to help you.” The temptation of a Calamity-grade Companion Beast was just too great. Cave Era finally relented.</p>
<p>“I still need to gather a batch of elites from the alliance, especially those who are good at tracking and reconnaissance. We have to find An Tianzuo as soon as possible,” Hermit said.</p>
<p>“Failure is not an option,” Cave Era said in a deep voice.</p>
<p>“Just in case, I hope you can leave a time mark on Blood Shaman. It’s best if we don’t use it, but if there’s a need for your help, I hope you will provide me with your help. I must obtain the Dragon Turtle Companion Egg.” Hermit still planned for the worst.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo’s fame was just too resounding. The Federation was huge, and there were countless families. There were very few people who could reach An Tianzuo’s level or even match the six families.</p>
<p>If not for Sunset College’s Leng Zongzheng not escaping with An Tianzuo, Hermit wouldn’t have been able to guarantee that he could snatch the Dragon Turtle Companion Egg even with so many reinforcements.</p>
<p>Cave Era knew the significance of this operation, but she didn’t dare be careless. Just as Hermit had said, she left a time mark on Blood Shaman. If needed, she could appear beside Blood Shaman at any time.</p>
<p>Many of the elites in the alliance were gathered. Under Blood Shaman’s lead, they used the teleportation tunnel established by the alliance and quickly arrived near Luoyang to meet Hermit.</p>
<p>After Blood Shaman met Hermit, he immediately began tracking An Tianzuo and company.</p>
<p>Many Guardians with special abilities quickly found traces that originally didn’t exist. The group chased without stopping.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency Hermit, it shouldn’t be wrong. An Tianzuo and company should have fled in the direction of Mount Laojun,” a Guardian said after carefully observing the surroundings.</p>
<p>“An Tianzuo is indeed cunning. Even if we find them in Mount Laojun, there’s a taboo power there. We can’t use force to kill him. It won’t be easy to capture him,” said Blood Shaman.</p>
<p>Hermit sneered and said, “That might not be the case. Mount Laojun’s taboo power is indeed terrifying, but we don’t need to kill on it.”</p>
<p>Under Hermit’s lead, the group arrived at Mount Laojun.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, An Tianzuo concealed his tracks very well. The six families didn’t find his trail.” Blood Shaman looked around Mount Laojun and didn’t discover anyone from the other families.</p>
<p>“Are you sure they are on the mountain?” Hermit asked the Guardian beside him.</p>
<p>“There’s no mistake. They must be on the mountain. Although they erased their auras and severed all traces, they can’t hide from my senses. They have been here,” the Guardian said with certainty.</p>
<p>“Up the mountain.” Hermit had great confidence in the Guardian’s abilities. He immediately led the way up the mountain and soon arrived in front of the Wordless Monument.</p>
<p>Without seeing anyone here, everyone continued walking up the mountain. When they were about to reach the golden peak, they finally saw many people gathered on the nearby stone steps and stone platforms. It was An Tianzuo and company; among them were Smith and the vanished spies from the various families.</p>

<p>“Overseer An, how have you been?” Hermit’s gaze swept across Zhou Wen’s face before landing on An Tianzuo’s face.</p>
<p>Although the An family had many experts, there were only two people he cared about.</p>
<p>“It’s my honor to have two Heavenly Kings of the League of Guardians take action together,” An Tianzuo said with a smile.</p>
<p>“It’s only right. After all, it’s Overseer An.” Hermit looked at Smith and company. Seeing that they were only chained up and the situation wasn’t bad, he continued, “Overseer An, it looks like you aren’t determined to betray the Federation. Why don’t we do this? Return with us and explain things to Congress. There’s no need to make a big fuss over a misunderstanding. What do you think, Overseer?”</p>
<p>“Are we going to the Federation’s Congress or the Alliance’s Congress?” An Tianzuo asked.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, Overseer is bent on becoming enemies with the Federation.” Hermit’s expression changed slightly. Everyone knew that only the Federation had a Congress. How could there be an Alliance Congress?</p>
<p>An Tianzuo’s words were clearly mocking the League for secretly controlling the Federation Congress.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you come here for the Dragon Turtle Companion Egg and Thief Sage? If I were to tell you that I didn’t capture Thief Sage or obtain the Dragon Turtle Companion Egg, would you believe me?” An Tianzuo said slowly.</p>
<p>“Overseer, you must be joking. If you didn’t obtain it, why go through so much trouble? A smart person like you wouldn’t joke around with the An family’s lives, right?” Hermit naturally didn’t believe him.</p>
<p>“Of course not. I don’t like to mess around either. However, you have shown your preference to mess around with me. You always get people I don’t like to mess around with me at times I dislike.” An Tianzuo looked at Hermit and said, “Therefore, I have to do something to let you know that I’m not someone who likes to mess around. It’s to prevent you from having any further misunderstandings.”</p>
<p>At this point, Hermit didn’t deny anything. He only said indifferently, “Then, Overseer, what do you plan on doing to let those people know that you don’t like to mess around?”</p>
<p>“Tell them loudly that I don’t like fooling around,” An Tianzuo said solemnly.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid that just saying it won’t work,” Hermit said.</p>
<p>“Who knows? It might be useful,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“Overseer, if you wish to say something, you can say it in Congress. There are people there who are very willing to listen to you. If you can move them, it might be of some use,” Hermit said.</p>
<p>“What if I don’t?” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“That’s our duty,” Hermit said solemnly.</p>
<p>“I’ve long heard that the four Heavenly Kings of the League of Guardians are invincible. I’ve always wanted to verify that.” An Tianzuo remained unperturbed.</p>
<p>“If Overseer is interested, I’m willing to accompany you down Mount Laojun.” Unless it was a last resort, Hermit didn’t wish to take action on Mount Laojun.</p>
<p>“Sure,” An Tianzuo said as he walked down the steps.</p>
<p>Hermit and Blood Shaman were slightly taken aback as they exchanged looks. Seeing that An Tianzuo had already walked down, they could only retreat down the mountain.</p>
<p>“Stay here and wait for me,” An Tianzuo instructed. He stopped the Sunset Army from following him down the mountain before walking down alone.</p>
<p>Although Hermit and Blood Shaman were somewhat puzzled as to why An Tianzuo would give up on Mount Laojun and follow them down the mountain alone, it was clearly beneficial to them. There was no reason for them not to accept it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled as well. He didn’t know what An Tianzuo was up to, but since An Sheng wasn’t around, he couldn’t ask anyone. All he could do was whisper to Ouyang Lan who was carrying Ya’er. “Sis Lan, what’s going on?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen already realized that something was amiss. He believed An Tianzuo’s words. Perhaps An Tianzuo really hadn’t captured Liu Yun.</p>
<p>This was because he knew very well that Liu Yun didn’t have the Dragon Turtle Companion Egg. Even if An Tianzuo captured Liu Yun, it was impossible for him to obtain a Companion Egg. However, he didn’t understand why An Tianzuo would do this. The outcome of his actions was making the entire world believe that he had obtained the Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Could it be that he wants to lure all the members of the League of Guardians over and wipe them out? Zhou Wen felt that An Tianzuo was crazy enough to carry that out.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that the League of Guardians was extremely powerful, there were many Terror-grade experts other than the four Heavenly Kings. An Tianzuo was the only Terror-grade expert in the An family, so they had no chance of winning.</p>
<p>Even if they had a chance of winning, the League of Guardians had the dimension behind them. When the time came, if the dimension really wanted to destroy the An family at all costs, it wouldn’t be difficult to gather more Terror-grade Guardians.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had heard from An Sheng that not all the Terror-grade Guardians in the League of Guardians came from the Guardian cocoons. Many Guardians were sent over from the dimension using special means. The League of Guardians would subsequently choose suitable humans to contract them.</p>
<p>After all, Guardians were created from the dimension. It wasn’t difficult to create more.</p>
<p>However, the Guardians that were sent directly from the dimension seemed to possess flaws. Despite being at the same Terror grade, those that were sent from the dimension couldn’t compare to the Guardians that had grown up on Earth.</p>
<p>Even so, it was already terrifying. The Terror grade was nothing to scoff at after all. Only a Terror grade could match it. It was already a top combat power on Earth.</p>
<p>Just like the Guardians that came with Blood Shaman and Hermit, there were seven to eight at the Terror grade. Even Zhou Wen didn’t dare underestimate such terrifying combat strength.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Little Zuo didn’t say, but you don’t have to worry. Little Zuo knows his limits. He naturally has his plans,” Ouyang Lan said.</p>
<p>“Why would I be worried about him? I’m worried about you,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan smiled and said, “It’s all the same.”</p>
<p>Blood Shaman and Hermit found it unbelievable that An Tianzuo followed them down the mountain alone. Even Zhou Wen hadn’t come down with him.</p>
<p>“Overseer, you have such boldness and magnanimity. I’ll warm up with you.” Hermit glanced at Blood Shaman, signaling him to attack at any time.</p>
<p>“Attack together, all of you.” As An Tianzuo spoke, he had already summoned his strange Life Soul to fuse with him.</p>
<p>His slender figure was wrapped in white metal armor. A blood-colored cape fluttered behind him like a blood-colored rainbow. He held a huge sword over his shoulder and a Gatling in his other hand. His appearance was indescribably domineering.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also watching An Tianzuo. He had yet to see An Tianzuo’s true strength. The last time An Tianzuo fought Xiao, he had already lost an arm. His combat strength had been greatly affected, so it hadn’t been his true strength.</p>
<p>“Since Overseer wishes so, we can only agree.” Hermit didn’t stand on ceremony as he called for Blood Shaman to attack with him.</p>
<p>He vaguely felt that something was amiss and began to worry. He planned on ending the battle quickly and taking down An Tianzuo first.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1241'>Chapter 1241: Battle of Mount Laojun 3</h3>

<p>Blood Shaman underwent Terror transformation and used the strength he was best at. Nobody within the blood-colored halo’s envelopment could summon their Companion Beasts for battle.</p>
<p>Hermit condensed a micro crystal and prepared to join forces with Blood Shaman to attack An Tianzuo. Hermit had even secretly sent out a signal for all the Guardians to attack together.</p>
<p>However, while they were still formulating their plan of attack, the Gatling in An Tianzuo’s hand had already begun firing crazily. Terrifying blue flames spewed out from the muzzle.</p>
<p>Ta! Ta! Ta! Ta! Ta! Ta! Ta!</p>
<p>The bullets were like a roaring meteor shower that instantly enveloped everyone.</p>
<p>The firing was very fast. Hermit’s figure blinked in and out of existence like a ghost as he dodged the bullets.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>However, Blood Shaman wasn’t that fast. His body emitted a sanguine glow as he punched at the bullets, hoping to send them flying.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>The bullets struck Blood Shaman’s fist and shattered the armor over his fist. At the same time, it sent the Blood Shaman retreating as he raised his arms uncontrollably.</p>
<p>The bullets rained down on him, causing Blood Shaman to retreat step by step. His feet cracked the ground as his armor shattered, revealing charred bullet holes.</p>
<p>Some of the Guardians behind him dodged in a panic while others used their own strength to block.</p>
<p>Some Guardians used their shields to block the bullets and were sent retreating. Some ducked the sweeping bullets, but there were also Guardians who failed to dodge. Their bodies were torn apart by the bullets as their blood and organs exploded and spewed to the ground.</p>
<p>The Mythical Guardians’ armor shattered. The humans inside had no chance of survival. Their lives were as fragile as paper.</p>
<p>In just an instant, all the Mythical Guardians were killed. One of the Terror-grade Guardians was killed and three or four were injured. The rest were more or less in a sorry state.</p>
<p>What domineering offensive power! Zhou Wen was slightly surprised by An Tianzuo’s destructive power. An Tianzuo, who now had both hands, was much stronger than the one-handed An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>The destructive power of the Gatling was something ordinary weapons could not contend with.</p>
<p>Hermit appeared behind An Tianzuo like a ghost. At the same time, he flicked out an indiscernible micro crystal. The micro crystal was as tiny as bacteria, but it contained the full strength of a Terror-grade power. If one didn’t sense it and accidentally touched it or had it invade their bodies, even a Terror-grade creature would be blasted to death.</p>
<p>However, as An Tianzuo fired the bullets crazily, it was as though he had eyes at the back of his head. He dodged the Hermit’s micro crystal while the Gatling in his hand continued firing. The bullets rained down on a Guardian like a volcanic eruption, blasting the Terror-grade Guardian’s body apart in midair.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Blood Shaman rushed to An Tianzuo’s other side and punched at the back of his head with a strange blood beam.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo didn’t even turn his head as he struck out with the huge sword in his other hand, slashing at Blood Shaman’s fist. He forcefully shattered Blood Shaman’s violent fist and repelled him.</p>
<p>The constantly rumbling Gatling sent a Terror-grade Guardian who was charging at him into a retreat. Its shield was filled with circular indentations formed by the bullets.</p>
<p>The other Terror-grade Guardians spread out and attacked An Tianzuo from different directions.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo’s expression was cold, but his body moved rapidly. At the same time, he slashed with his broadsword, unleashing all his Gatling firepower. Despite being surrounded, his powerful firepower suppressed Hermit and Blood Shaman’s attacks.</p>
<p>“Overseer, kill those bastards!” an officer, who wore his heart on his sleeve, shouted excitedly.</p>
<p>However, most people couldn’t see the battle. They didn’t even have the ability to see Terror-grade power.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally saw it clearly. Although he didn’t like An Tianzuo, he had to admit that An Tianzuo was almost inhuman. He looked more like a combat mecha.</p>
<p>His every move seemed to be calculated by a computer. There was no sign of him making mistakes in battle.</p>
<p>Even in such a high-intensity battle, there was nothing wrong with his actions.</p>
<p>Hermit and Blood Shaman were alarmed and furious. They had so many Guardians attacking An Tianzuo together, but they couldn’t even touch his clothes. Now, only the two of them and the five Terror-grade Guardians were left. Furthermore, they looked even more pathetic than An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>Blood Shaman was the most depressed. He was best at restraining humans who relied on Companion Beasts, but An Tianzuo didn’t use any Companion Beasts from beginning to end. He purely relied on his destructive power to suppress them.</p>
<p>Hermit was also secretly alarmed. Although he had long known that An Tianzuo was very strong, or he wouldn’t have been named one of the four war gods, he never expected him to be this strong. In terms of offensive strength, there weren’t many at the Terror grade who could fight him.</p>
<p>Worse still, not only was An Tianzuo’s offensive strength off the charts, but his movement techniques were as powerful as his melee abilities. Hermit had tried to sneak an attack on An Tianzuo several times, but he failed.</p>
<p>Blood Shaman’s melee attacks were repelled by An Tianzuo’s broadsword again and again.</p>
<p>“Blood Shaman, get Cave Era over. Her ability can restrain An Tianzuo.” Hermit couldn’t care less. He had to capture An Tianzuo as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Blood Shaman also knew that they had underestimated the horror of the four war gods. Without any hesitation, he activated the time mark that Cave Era had left on him.</p>
<p>A clock mark lit up on Blood Shaman’s forehead. At the instant the clock mark peeled off his forehead, it strangely transformed into Cave Era’s figure.</p>
<p>Cave Era’s expression turned nasty. She was about to ask Blood Shaman why he had used the time mark—she had clearly told him not to use it unless it was absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>However, before she could ask, the bullets that swept over made Cave Era realize what had happened.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Cave Era used her temporal powers. The rampaging bullets seemed to slow down as Cave Era slowly dodged the slow-moving bullets.</p>
<p>“Kill him.” Cave Era was equally alarmed when she saw the situation. Killing intent flashed in her eyes as she activated the temporal power. Her speed increased to an unbelievable level as she arrived in front of An Tianzuo and pointed at his forehead.</p>
<p>Cave Era’s ability was indeed somewhat effective against An Tianzuo. At such speeds, An Tianzuo was unable to control the Gatling’s sweeping fire. All he could do was retreat while using his broadsword to block the finger strike.</p>
<p>However, Cave Era’s fingers didn’t touch the sword at all. With another acceleration of time, she circled behind An Tianzuo and tapped at the back of his head again.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo threw the Gatling in his other hand back and smashed the gun barrel at Cave Era’s head, hoping to exchange a devastating blow.</p>
<p>How could Cave Era let him do as he wished? With a flash, she appeared on the other side of An Tianzuo with the temporal acceleration. Hermit and Blood Shaman also surrounded him.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo was immediately thrown into danger. The situation had gone south.</p>
<p>“Uncle is in danger.” Ya’er looked eagerly at Zhou Wen, clearly asking Zhou Wen to save him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1242'>Chapter 1242: Battle of Mount Laojun 4</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“Little Wen.” Although Ouyang Lan couldn’t see the situation in the arena, she looked eagerly at Zhou Wen when she heard Ya’er.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said, “I’ll give it a try.”</p>
<p>If An Tianzuo was killed, it would be their turn next. Zhou Wen felt that it was better to take action now. At the very least, things would be easier.</p>
<p>He only needed to deal with Cave Era. The abilities of the other Guardians weren’t much of a threat to An Tianzuo. It was best to let An Tianzuo deal with them himself. Zhou Wen had never liked to kill.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked down Mount Laojun and was about to enter the battlefield when he suddenly frowned and quickly retreated..</p>
<p>A ghost-like arrow flew past Zhou Wen’s hair and vanished mid-flight.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned his head and saw Xiao holding a bow in one hand and casually grabbing the air with the other. An arrow appeared in his hand and he nocked it. He aimed at Zhou Wen and said, “Little brother, don’t interrupt such an exciting performance, alright?”</p>
<p>“Xiao!” Ouyang Lan exclaimed. She naturally knew how powerful Xiao was.</p>
<p>Back when Zhou Wen and An Tianzuo were present and had the upper hand, they had failed to keep Xiao.</p>
<p>Beside Xiao were two people. From their attitude, they were likely not Xiao’s subordinates. They were probably saints from the Holy Temple like Xiao.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen said nothing as he summoned Sword Pill and held it in his hand.</p>
<p>“Why are you in such a rush to leave?” The arrow in Xiao’s hand flew out like a ghost, forcing Zhou Wen to dodge it.</p>
<p>From different directions, the other two saints also blocked the path Zhou Wen needed to take to help An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>“Let me do the introductions. This is Thunderstorm, a saint from the Connate Holy Temple,” Xiao said with a smile as he pointed at a fellow wearing Guardian armor. He wasn’t tall, but his figure was wide like a tank.</p>
<p>Thunderstorm snorted coldly and remained silent.</p>
<p>Xiao then pointed at another saint who had a relatively normal figure, but was wearing gorgeous golden armor. He looked like an emperor out on an inspection. “This is the Divine Emperor Holy Temple’s saint, Yellowright.”</p>
<p>Yellowright looked down at Zhou Wen from above like an emperor looking at a slave. He said coldly, “Xiao, I’m here to kill An Tianzuo. It’s best if you deal with such a fellow yourself.”</p>
<p>However, Xiao said seriously, “Brother Yellowright, you mustn’t underestimate the enemy. His strength isn’t inferior to An Tianzuo’s. I’m not his match alone. It’s safer for the three of us to attack together.”</p>
<p>Yellowright and Thunderstorm revealed looks of contempt when they heard Xiao.</p>
<p>“The saints of your Trajectory Holy Temple are best at avoiding the important and making light of the trivial. To deal with such a person, you even need three of us saints to join forces. Aren’t you embarrassed?” Yellowright said disdainfully.</p>
<p>“It’s better to be embarrassed than lose your life.” Xiao thought nothing of it. From the looks of it, if Yellowright and Thunderstorm left, he would immediately flee. He definitely wouldn’t fight Zhou Wen head-on.</p>
<p>“Fine. It won’t be much of a waste of time to deal with an inferior fellow. An Tianzuo won’t be able to escape anyway. It won’t be too late to kill him after taking this guy down,” Yellowright said as he walked towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>With every step he took, the golden light on his body intensified. Although the light was intense, it wasn’t scorching hot. It only emitted an indescribable pressure.</p>
<p>The Sunset Army officers watching the battle on the mountain seemed to be affected by some force despite being so far away. They had the urge to kneel down and worship him.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the officers who came with An Tianzuo were all military bigwigs. All of them had reached the Mythical stage, and their willpower had been tempered to an extremely tenacious level during the wars they were involved in. This allowed them to resist the urge to kneel.</p>
<p>“Holy Emperor Body… Isn’t that a power unique to the Cape family? Could this person be from the Cape family? It doesn’t look like it. He should be from the East District, right?” An officer who wasn’t in the know was secretly surprised.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally knew that Yellowright was definitely not from the Cape family, but from the Divine Emperor Holy Temple.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had always suspected that the secrets he had heard from the Dugu family seemed to be related to these saints.</p>
<p>He also suspected that some of the orphans nurtured by Dugu Qianqiu had later entered the Holy Temple and become saints.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the spots to enter the Holy Land were in the hands of the six families every year. Ordinary people couldn’t enter, so the Holy Temples had no chance of finding suitable candidates.</p>
<p>As for the orphans, they were different. If there was an existence among the orphans who looked identical to the youths of the six families, they could replace them without anyone noticing and enter the Holy Land.</p>
<p>Otherwise, saints like Xiao and Blaze definitely couldn’t be nurtured overnight. It was also impossible for the Holy Temple to randomly make someone a saint.</p>
<p>However, this was only Zhou Wen’s guess. He wasn’t sure if the saints were related to the orphans nurtured by Dugu Qianqiu.</p>
<p>Now, what Zhou Wen wanted to know was the relationship between the Holy Temples and the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>It didn’t seem like they were in cahoots. Cave Era and the others were also somewhat surprised by the arrival of the three saints.</p>
<p>However, from Cave Era and company’s reaction, Zhou Wen felt that they didn’t treat Xiao and company as enemies. There wasn’t much animosity. This also meant that things weren’t that simple between them. At the very least, they weren’t strangers.</p>
<p>Yellowright walked towards Zhou Wen step by step. Not only was his power of imperial authority rising from his body, but golden chains also began to appear around Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>The golden chains gradually materialized and bound Zhou Wen’s body. Like shackles, they bound him tightly.</p>
<p>“Thunder, let’s attack together,” Xiao said to Thunderstorm.</p>
<p>“That’s not necessary. I alone am enough.” Yellowright rejected him arrogantly. As he got closer and closer to Zhou Wen, the shackles on Zhou Wen’s body became more and more corporeal. The restrictions on his body also became stronger.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen increasingly felt that these saints resembled the orphans. They were indeed very powerful, but they also seemed to be lacking in character. They were somewhat different from ordinary people.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that it was very likely the result of growing up in that special environment. He originally wanted to observe for a while longer, but Yellowright had already walked in front of him and raised the golden sword condensed from golden light in his hand. The mighty power of imperial authority emitted by the golden sword was much stronger than when Xiao used the Holy Emperor Body.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the difference between professionals and amateurs. As Zhou Wen was thinking, Yellowright slashed down. He wasn’t in the mood to waste his breath on Zhou Wen. An Tianzuo, one of the four war gods, was his desired opponent.</p>
<p>Naive child. Zhou Wen sighed inwardly as he gripped the Sword Pill in his hand.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter1243'>Chapter 1243: Battle of Mount Laojun 5</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Just as the golden sword was about to slash at Zhou Wen, he finally moved.</p>
<p>The golden chains that bound him were like rotting ropes. As Zhou Wen slashed, they shattered one by one and turned to dust.</p>
<p>The sword formed by Sword Pill drew a beautiful arc, but it was so fast that no one could react.</p>
<p>Sword Pill collided with the golden sword, but the blade didn’t stop. It didn’t even pause as it continued slashing forward.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen retracted his sword, everyone heard the hum of the sword. They couldn’t help but look at Yellowright. As the strike was too fast, they failed to see if the strike had hit him.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Yellowright stood there, looking uninjured. He still maintained the stance of slashing forward, and the sword of imperial authority also appeared unharmed.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, Yellowright stood there motionless as his eyes were filled with horror.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he moved. No, it shouldn’t be said that Yellowright moved. More accurately, Yellowright’s body was sliding apart.</p>
<p>Like a fractured iceberg, the upper half of Yellowright’s body and the lower half slowly slid away. It was the same for his golden sword. The sword broke from the middle.</p>
<p>“Yellowright…” Thunderstorm watched Yellowright’s corpse collapse with a look of shock.</p>
<p>Although Yellowright wasn’t the strongest among the saints, he wasn’t weak either. Despite him attacking first, he was killed by a human with a single strike. This was unimaginable.</p>
<p>“Sigh, why was he sick of living? Why were you so disobedient?” Xiao sighed.</p>
<p>Among the many officers of the Sunset Army, the officers who had been to Netherworld City had better reactions. However, those who hadn’t seen Zhou Wen showcase his might there were in a daze.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s strike gave off a unique sense of shock when compared to An Tianzuo’s powerful firepower.</p>
<p>Although it wasn’t as ferocious as the full-powered firepower, it sent chills down one’s spine and gave one goosebumps.</p>
<p>Most people failed to see Zhou Wen’s strike, but after Yellowright was killed, his body appeared. The scene of half Yellowright’s body slowly sliding down made it difficult to forget.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at An Tianzuo and saw that although An Tianzuo’s situation was dire, he wasn’t in immediate danger of death. He didn’t rush over immediately.</p>
<p>As for Cave Era and company, they were alarmed when they saw Zhou Wen kill Yellowright with one strike. Their attacks became even crazier.</p>
<p>They originally imagined that An Tianzuo was already very terrifying, but they never expected another person to be even more terrifying than him.</p>
<p>If they couldn’t finish off An Tianzuo before Zhou Wen rushed over, how terrifying would it be to have the two of them join forces? They didn’t dare imagine it, nor were they willing to think about it.</p>
<p>The pressure on An Tianzuo increased exponentially. The armor on his body suffered some injuries as blood seeped out.</p>
<p>However, An Tianzuo’s eyes remained calm the entire time. Despite being on the brink of death, he still looked at his watch.</p>
<p>He was actually wearing a watch on his wrist. While looking at the time, An Tianzuo dodged Cave Era’s attack at the critical moment and said, “10.”</p>
<p>Nobody knew what An Tianzuo meant. Why did he suddenly say such a number?</p>
<p>“9,” An Tianzuo continued as he fought.</p>
<p>Only then did everyone realize that An Tianzuo was counting down.</p>
<p>“8.” An Tianzuo continued counting.</p>
<p>Hermit and Blood Shaman didn’t know why An Tianzuo was counting down, but as An Tianzuo counted down, they couldn’t help but become nervous. Their attacks became even more ferocious.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already realized something, so he wasn’t in a rush to join the battle. Instead, he aimed his sword at Xiao and Thunderstorm.</p>
<p>“Will you be escaping this time as well?” Zhou Wen asked Xiao.</p>
<p>Although his movement technique was excellent, it was still very difficult for him to retain Xiao if he was desperate to escape.</p>
<p>“Escape? How is that possible?” After Xiao said that, his figure suddenly drew a strange trajectory and flew backward like a ghost. In the blink of an eye, he vanished without a trace. Only his voice still echoed in place.</p>
<p>“This is called a tactical retreat.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised, but Thunderstorm was already dumbfounded.</p>
<p>The three saints had besieged a young man and one of them was killed with a single strike. The other fled without fighting, leaving him rooted to the ground. Before he came here, he never expected such a huge change to happen in less than twenty seconds.</p>
<p>The officers of the Sunset Army looked at Zhou Wen with odd expressions.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo’s strength was shocking, but Zhou Wen left their hearts chilling.</p>
<p>They had previously believed that Zhou Wen had been besieged by three people, but now, they suddenly realized that it was Zhou Wen besieging the three saints alone.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>They were still worried for Zhou Wen, worried that he would die from the siege, but now, they suddenly felt that it was a pity that Xiao had escaped.</p>
<p>Thunderstorm gritted his teeth as the Connate aura on his body transformed into the power of lightning. His surroundings were instantly drowned by lightning. He didn’t have Xiao’s speed, nor was he good at escaping. Therefore, he could only fight with his life.</p>
<p>Just as Thunderstorm raised his fist, Zhou Wen’s Sword Pill arrived in front of him. Wherever the blade passed, the lightning dissipated and Thunderstorm’s corpse collapsed.</p>
<p>“Was the saint Young Master Wen killed really at the Terror grade?” an officer asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Many officers were puzzled. Thunderstorm and Yellowright looked too weak. They didn’t look like they were at the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Qin Wufu sighed and said, “It’s not that those two saints aren’t at the Terror grade, but that Zhou Wen seems inhuman.”</p>
<p>Everyone agreed with him. Many officers subconsciously nodded. Qin Wufu’s words had hit the nail on the head.</p>
<p>“Governor Qin, why are you cursing?” Ouyang Lan was displeased.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen was inhuman, what was she as a mother?</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen didn’t participate in An Tianzuo’s battle, everything that happened here had a huge impact on the battle.</p>
<p>Cave Era and company originally wanted to finish off An Tianzuo before Zhou Wen rushed over.</p>
<p>However, no one expected that everything would happen so quickly. The sudden appearance of the three saints only resulted in two deaths and one escape. Everything happened so quickly that they couldn’t react in time. They found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>However, at the instant Thunderstorm collapsed, their fighting spirit fell to rock bottom. They knew very well that there was no chance. Zhou Wen, who had been hiding in the An family, was even more terrifying than An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>“3…” An Tianzuo’s countdown continued like a haunting spell.</p>
<p>Now, Cave Era and company were beginning to regret chasing after An Tianzuo. However, who would have expected such a situation?</p>
<p>They wanted to retreat, but under An Tianzuo’s terrifying firepower, it wasn’t that easy.</p>
<p>Cave Era and Hermit might have a way to retreat immediately, but once they did, doom was a certainty for the other Terror-grade Guardians.</p>
<p>“2…”</p>
<p>Cave Era had already made plans to retreat, but she didn’t immediately implement them. She wanted to know what An Tianzuo’s countdown meant.</p>
<p>“1…” Finally, An Tianzuo spat out the last number.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter1244'>Chapter 1244: Aurora</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>With An Tianzuo saying that, Blood Shaman and the other Guardians subconsciously retreated. No one attacked again.</p>
<p>If it were anyone else counting down, they probably wouldn’t have bothered. However, it was An Tianzuo. That made things completely different. They still felt a little afraid deep down.</p>
<p>The moment they retreated, An Tianzuo attacked with all his might. At the same time, he said, ‘0.’</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, isn’t this a scam? Zhou Wen was also waiting for the outcome, but to his surprise, there was a 0 after 1.</p>
<p>As no one attacked An Tianzuo again, An Tianzuo no longer needed to be restrained. He aimed all his firepower at a Terror-grade Guardian and riddled it with holes before blasting it in midair..</p>
<p>Cave Era and company were furious, but since 0 had already been said, they didn’t dare charge forward.</p>
<p>What was even more infuriating was that after 0 was said, everyone was waiting for something to happen, but nothing happened. It only gave An Tianzuo the opportunity to kill two more Guardians.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>“An Tianzuo!” Cave Era was infuriated. If they hadn’t been fooled by him, they wouldn’t have been thrown into a panic. They might have already forced An Tianzuo into a corner.</p>
<p>“The legendary four great war gods are only this and nothing more. They are just treacherous people,” Hermit said coldly.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo’s expression remained unchanged as he said indifferently, “Did you hear that?”</p>
<p>“Hear what?” When Cave Era realized that An Tianzuo didn’t look like he was joking, she felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>“My voice,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“What about your voice?” Hermit’s heart skipped a beat as he hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo said indifferently, “There’s nothing to be heard yet. However, I can only say that the four, only the four Heavenly Kings of the League of Guardians are only this and nothing more.”</p>
<p>Many officers of the Sunset Army found it odd. They didn’t hear anything special. An Tianzuo was speaking, but the voice he was referring to clearly wasn’t his.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could roughly guess what An Tianzuo had done, but he couldn’t tell the exact location.</p>
<p>When Cave Era and Hermit heard that, their expressions changed drastically. Hermit shouted, “Not good. Cave Era, quickly return and take a look.”</p>
<p>Cave Era reacted faster than Hermit. She had already grabbed Blood Shaman and vanished under the effects of temporal powers, returning to the headquarters of the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>Hermit also escaped without any hesitation. An Tianzuo knew that Hermit’s strength was strange. If he was focused on escaping, it would probably be difficult to stop him. Therefore, he didn’t try.</p>
<p>However, the remaining Terror-grade Guardians were doomed. An Tianzuo unleashed a massacre as he killed all the Guardians that were fleeing in all directions. In the end, not a single one of them escaped.</p>
<p>Cave Era used temporal powers to bring Blood Shaman back to the headquarters of the League of Guardians. When she saw that the headquarters was safe and sound, she heaved a sigh of relief. However, her expression turned extremely ugly the next moment.</p>
<p>A strange sound spread in the air and pierced her eardrums, causing them to hurt.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Cave Era instantly flew into the air and looked in the direction of Skysplit Tower. This glance made her shiver from head to toe as she hovered there in a daze.</p>
<p>The so-called Skysplit Tower was an unfinished spatial teleportation station that the League of Guardians had spent a huge price and a massive amount of resources to build with the help of the dimension. Up to now, it had yet to be completed.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, some basic functions had been usable. Many Guardians of the League of Guardians had teleported here using the Skysplit Tower.</p>
<p>It could be said that the Skysplit Tower was the greatest capital of the League of Guardians. Without the Skysplit Tower, there were no dimensional resources, so the foundation that allowed the League of Guardians to dominate the other factions was gone.</p>
<p>The Skysplit Tower was near the headquarters of the League of Guardians. It was like a huge cylinder that passed through the clouds and into the sky.</p>
<p>Due to the importance of the Skysplit Tower, Blood Shaman and Uesugi Nao would take turns guarding it. In addition, there were many Terror-grade Guardians nearby.</p>
<p>With Cave Era guarding the headquarters, it was impossible for anyone to approach Skysplit Tower.</p>
<p>However, for this excursion, most of the Guardians who were good at reconnaissance and tracking had been deployed to pursue An Tianzuo. Blood Shaman had also been deployed. Apart from Uesugi Nao, who was left in Skysplit Tower, Cave Era had also left the headquarters.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, this was the period when Skysplit Tower’s defense was at its weakest. But even so, it wasn’t something that an ordinary person could approach.</p>
<p>Indeed, no one approached Skysplit Tower. However, an aurora-like beam streaked across the sky from the south, turning the night into day. When the aurora struck Skysplit Tower, it seemed to pierce through the huge Skysplit Tower like a drill. It had already fractured and collapsed. The tilting tower fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Amidst the strange rumbling, the ground trembled like an earthquake. The shockwave stirred up rocks and mud, sweeping out like a tsunami.</p>
<p>Everything within dozens of kilometers was reduced to ruins as though the end of the world had arrived.</p>
<p>Cave Era watched as the aurora streaked across the sky like a rainbow. It lasted for nearly thirty seconds before it completely vanished. The sky turned dark again.</p>
<p>Cave Era rushed to the ruins of Skysplit Tower and saw that the originally thousand-meter-tall Skysplit Tower was now less than a hundred meters tall. The other parts had already collapsed.</p>
<p>And in Skysplit Tower, there were no signs of life. There should have been many members of the League of Guardians inside, but now, not a single person could be seen.</p>
<p>Even the signatures of life remained pathetic dozens of kilometers away. Very few of the Guardians situated along the lines of defense were left.</p>
<p>Many alarmed Guardians crawled out of the rubble with ashen faces. They still didn’t know what had happened. They no longer had their usual arrogance. Their faces were filled with confusion and horror.</p>
<p>Looking at the scene in front of her, Cave Era could only feel a bone-chilling coldness spreading in her heart.</p>
<p>“This is his voice?” Cave Era muttered to herself as her body involuntarily trembled.</p>
<p>Thinking of the man’s casual words, Cave Era found it akin to a devil’s curse.</p>
<p>“Cough.” Uesugi Nao, who was wearing the Great Skyfiend armor, crawled out of the Skysplit Tower’s base. Her Terror-grade Guardian armor was covered in cracks. Filthy blood mixed with mud stained her body and messy hair. Even standing up from the ground looked very difficult.</p>
<p>“Cave Era, what happened?” Uesugi Nao asked in agitation. She had nearly died in the Skysplit Tower.</p>
<p>“I also want to know what happened.” Although Uesugi Nao wasn’t dead, Cave Era couldn’t bring herself to feel happy. The coldness in her heart continued spreading.</p>
<p>The cost of building the Skysplit Tower was great. The damage was too much for them to bear. Furthermore, no one knew if there would be a second aurora, nor did they know where it would descend next.</p>
<p>The humans and beasts within a few hundred kilometers saw the aurora that penetrated the sky and the destruction of the towering Skysplit Tower. Instantly, the entire Federation was in an uproar.</p>
<p>All sorts of videos instantly filled the Internet. The aurora shocked the entire world.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1245'>Chapter 1245: Intimidating the Federation</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>All the major factions were studying the aurora’s recording. Someone had recorded it clearly. A beam of the aurora streaked across the sky and penetrated Skysplit Tower.</p>
<p>Then, Skysplit Tower seemed to instantly heat up, producing terrifyingly high temperatures that turned the entire tower into a red-hot piece of metal.</p>
<p>Then, the tower shattered and collapsed—the explosion producing a powerful shockwave that destroyed everything in a radius of nearly fifteen kilometers. It was as though the end of the world had arrived.</p>
<p>“That’s Skysplit Tower. How many people have designs on Skysplit Tower? Even a Terror-grade powerhouse can’t return on a trip there. It was destroyed with just one shot?” Xia Liuchuan was dumbfounded. It was a while before he could speak.</p>
<p>“The intensity of that aurora beam should be comparable to a Calamity-grade’s strength.. However, it doesn’t seem to be a skill of a Calamity-grade creature. It’s more like a laser weapon fired by humans,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a strange expression.</p>
<p>“That can’t be. Can humans create weapons of that magnitude?” Xia Liuchuan found it incredulous.</p>
<p>“Who knows?” Zhang Chunqiu wasn’t sure either.</p>
<p>The entire world was discussing the aurora’s origins. At the same time, many people cast suspicious gazes at Luoyang’s An family.</p>
<p>The League of Guardians chased after An Tianzuo with all their might, but at that moment, Skysplit Tower had been blasted apart. This was too much of a coincidence.</p>
<p>However, people were very suspicious if An Tianzuo really had that much power. Even someone as powerful as the four war gods couldn’t possess such potent strength.</p>
<p>Furthermore, An Tianzuo hadn’t been near Skysplit Tower then. He was far away at Mount Laojun.</p>
<p>However, soon, more suspicious points appeared. As Luoyang was closely monitored by various factions, someone discovered that An Sheng had brought a group of men and escorted a behemoth into Luoyang.</p>
<p>It wasn’t strange to escort something into Luoyang, but at the critical moment of the An family’s life and death, An Sheng, a loyalist of the An family, hadn’t been at Mount Laojun. Furthermore, after investigations, they discovered that the path he had used to return was likely in the direction of the Skysplit Tower.</p>
<p>What was even more suspicious was that someone had discovered traces of Thief Sage in the desert. The An family didn’t seem to have caught him at all.</p>
<p>All the evidence pointed at the An family, but no one dared to touch them. The League of Guardians, who had suffered greatly, didn’t act rashly.</p>
<p>Even the spies of the various factions in Luoyang were ordered to temporarily evacuate. Many of their plans for the An family were temporarily put on hold.</p>
<p>No one wanted such a terrifying strike to land on their home. If a place like Skysplit Tower could be destroyed, no one dared to imagine the consequences if the target was their lair.</p>
<p>Instantly, the An family turned into a ferocious beast. Everyone’s expression changed at the mention of it. Before confirming if the An family could still use such terrifying power, it was unlikely anyone would dare to attack them.</p>
<p>However, many people tried to investigate the An family and figure out the aurora’s origins. This was the best outcome An Tianzuo wanted. At the very least, no one dared to harm his family.</p>
<p>An Sheng returned to An Tianzuo’s side at the An family residence.</p>
<p>“Overseer, I didn’t let you down and successfully completed the mission.” An Sheng led the soldiers to report to An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>“Did you enjoy it?” An Tianzuo asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“Yes,” An Sheng answered.</p>
<p>“Did it give you a kick?” An Tianzuo asked again.</p>
<p>“Yes!” all the soldiers who participated in this operation answered loudly.</p>
<p>“That’s good. In the future, if anyone makes us unhappy, we’ll have a kicking good time. All members participating in this operation will be awarded the Sunset Tristar Medal. All of you will be promoted by a rank…” An Tianzuo rewarded the participating members and all the members of the Sunset Army.</p>
<p>During the period An Tianzuo had strategically evacuated Luoyang, there hadn’t been any unrest. All the troops who had stayed behind without knowing the situation carried out their duties, preventing any major upheavals in Luoyang.</p>
<p>Li Mobai, who had always given An Tianzuo a headache, had helped stabilize the situation in Luoyang. This surprised An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo originally wanted to take this opportunity to clean up Luoyang. Li Mobai was his greatest threat, but he never expected that Li Mobai had no intention of occupying Luoyang during the chaos.</p>
<p>“It was really close this time.” Li Xuan had been staying in the Li family the entire time. After hearing the news of An Tianzuo’s return, he felt relieved.</p>
<p>He wasn’t worried about An Tianzuo, but he was glad that Li Mobai hadn’t taken the opportunity to forcefully occupy Luoyang.</p>
<p>Li Mobai glanced at Li Xuan in contempt. “To think you’re so close to the An family. You can’t even see through such a trivial trick from An Tianzuo. What else can you do?”</p>
<p>“I’m not someone who does big things.” Li Xuan shrugged indifferently.</p>
<p>However, he was truly impressed by Li Mobai. He knew very well how much Li Mobai wanted the Li family to replace the An family as the kings of Luoyang, but in the face of such a huge temptation, Li Mobai had actually seen through An Tianzuo’s intentions. Furthermore, he firmly believed that An Tianzuo could return. This was indeed something no ordinary person dared to do.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Not long after An Sheng returned, he went to look for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had also seen the video online. He had long guessed that it was An Sheng’s doing. Furthermore, he had already guessed what had produced the aurora.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Back then, An Sheng had taken him to see the huge compression accelerator. However, Zhou Wen never expected it to be so terrifying. Even Zhou Wen didn’t dare withstand the might of the strike. It was probably comparable to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>An Sheng didn’t hide anything from Zhou Wen and told him the entire story.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, Overseer didn’t mean to hide it from you. It’s just that this operation was too risky. The fewer people who knew about it, the better. If people noticed something amiss, we wouldn’t have been able to lure Cave Era and the rest over. It’s actually very difficult to power up the accelerator at that distance without being discovered by Cave Era,” An Sheng explained.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t mind this matter and nodded. “It’s indeed very risky. Not only did you lure Cave Era over, but you even lured the people from the Holy Temple over too.”</p>
<p>An Sheng smiled and said, “Actually, Chancellor Leng was nearby. As long as Overseer gave the signal, he would rescue us.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised. This was An Tianzuo’s style. There was no reason for him to take such a huge risk without any preparations.</p>
<p>“However, although Overseer won’t say it, I can tell that he’s very touched that you helped him at the critical moment,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“I just don’t want anything to happen to Sis Lan and company. It has nothing to do with him,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>An Sheng smiled and said, “We’re family. There’s no need to draw the lines so cleanly.”</p>
<p>After a pause, An Sheng said with a bitter expression, “However, this blast wiped out years of the An family’s savings. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that we have returned to a state of poverty overnight. We will have to tighten our belts in the future.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. “That thing consumes so many resources?”</p>
<p>“It’s not just a huge amount. It should be called a terrifying amount. If we don’t chance upon a large number of unexpected resources, it will be impossible for a second shot to happen in the next few years,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you afraid that the League of Guardians will seek revenge?” Zhou Wen said with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>“That depends on whether they have the guts to take the bet. Overseer said that they don’t have the guts.” An Sheng looked very relaxed as he said to Zhou Wen, “However, Overseer said that we can’t let anyone other than our family know about this. Otherwise, it will be terrible.”</p>
<p>“I can only guarantee that the news won’t leak from me,” Zhou Wen said solemnly.</p>
<p>An Sheng laughed. “If he didn’t trust you, Overseer wouldn’t have tacitly allowed me to tell you.”</p>
<p>As the two of them were talking, An Sheng suddenly received news that another creature had entered the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1246'>Chapter 1246: Moon Goddess?</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly took out his phone and opened a mainstream livestream app. Soon, he saw the scene of the Cube.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was stunned the moment he saw it.</p>
<p>The creature in the scene was dressed in a white muslin robe. On the scorching Venus, the sleeves fluttered slightly. Its body emitted a faint luster, making one feel cool and peaceful for some reason.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi! Although ordinary people couldn’t discern Tsukuyomi’s true appearance due to the veil that covered her face and the light that blurred her figure, Zhou Wen still recognized her at a glance.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi’s temperament was unique. After spending a long time with her, it was easy to recognize her.</p>
<p>Is Tsukuyomi really going in? Zhou Wen sighed.. He finally understood why Tsukuyomi was unwilling to leave Earth.</p>
<p>However, Tsukuyomi had rejected his help in the end and had chosen to leave Earth. This puzzled Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi landed on the platform of the hemispherical metal building. She didn’t drip her blood onto the platform. Instead, she took a step and arrived inside the room.</p>
<p>“Is this a fairy from myths? She’s so beautiful!”</p>
<p>“She can’t be a human, right? I can’t tell if she’s a dimensional creature.”</p>
<p>“It’s too blurry. I can’t see clearly. Perhaps her face is extremely ugly.”</p>
<p>“With that figure and temperament, she can’t be ugly.”</p>
<p>Everyone discussed spiritedly. The focus was actually Tsukuyomi’s looks.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi’s clothes fluttered as she floated in the room. The Metal Guard’s bullets immediately shot over.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi slowly landed on the ground and ignored the bullets. However, the bullets gradually vanished as they flew, like snowflakes melting in the sunlight.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that it wasn’t just the bullets. Even the Metal Guard’s body was slowly disappearing.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the Metal Guard had vanished like the bullet.</p>
<p>The six doors opened at the same time. Groups of Metal Guards rushed out of the six doors and kept firing at Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>When the rain of bullets flew towards her, they strangely vanished again. The Metal Guards’ bodies were the same. In just a while, more than a hundred Metal Guards vanished one by one, leaving nothing on the ground.</p>
<p>There were no dimensional crystals or Companion Eggs. The room was spotless.</p>
<p>The spectating humans didn’t dare say a word. Ever since the live broadcast of the Cube, everyone’s horizons had gradually broadened. They had also seen many powerful creatures.</p>
<p>An existence as powerful as the Dragon Turtle still needed to reflect the enemy’s attack, but this was the first time they had seen an existence standing there without moving.</p>
<p>What humans were most afraid of wasn’t the terrifying power they could see, but the fear of the unknown. They couldn’t understand how Tsukuyomi had killed the Metal Guards, so the fear in their hearts would subconsciously multiply.</p>
<p>“Professor Gu, what do you think of this new mysterious creature? Who do you think is stronger when compared to the Dragon Turtle?” The host of the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau interviewed an old professor for his opinion.</p>
<p>Professor Gu was a permanent guest on the Cube’s live broadcast. He was quite powerful and was knowledgeable. His previous analyses were accurate and the audience thought highly of him.</p>
<p>Professor Gu thought for a moment and said, “The Dragon Turtle’s level in East District mythology is rather high. It’s very difficult for ordinary dimensional creatures to compare with it.”</p>
<p>“Professor Gu, do you think that this mysterious woman’s ability is inferior to the Dragon Turtle?” The host wanted to further confirm what Professor Gu meant.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Professor Gu shook his head and said, “On the contrary, I think this mysterious woman is stronger.”</p>
<p>The host asked in puzzlement, “Professor Gu, I don’t quite understand. You just said that Dragon Turtle has a rather high status in East District mythology, but now, you are saying that the mysterious woman is stronger than Dragon Turtle. Could it be that you have already recognized the mysterious woman’s origins? Is her level in mythology above Dragon Turtle?”</p>
<p>Professor Gu said, “You could say that. According to my judgment, this mysterious woman might be a famous figure in the myths and legends of the East District. She’s the kind that everyone knows.”</p>
<p>“I’m just too curious. I believe the viewers are also very curious. Professor Gu, can you announce the answer now?” the host said.</p>
<p>“Of course. If my judgment is correct, this mysterious woman might very well be the one on the moon in myths and legends,” Professor Gu said with certainty.</p>
<p>“Ah… Could it be that… that mysterious woman is the legendary fairy, Chang’e…” the host said in surprise.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the host. Many spectators in the East District were already excited when they heard Professor Gu.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, with that figure and aura, it’s really possible.”</p>
<p>“No way, even Fairy Chang’e has appeared!”</p>
<p>“If it’s really Fairy Chang’e, I’d rather live an hour less just to see her true appearance.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Fairy Chang’e was just too famous in the East District. The audience’s enthusiasm was instantly ignited.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was at a loss whether to laugh or cry when he heard that. He was a man who had seen the real Chang’e. He wondered what they would think if they saw the real Chang’e.</p>
<p>Although Professor Gu wasn’t right about Tsukuyomi’s identity, his train of thought was correct. He had only guessed the wrong pantheon.</p>
<p>As people were discussing, the Golden Battle God Mark I had already rushed out and shot at Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, his bullets didn’t have a better effect than the Metal Guard’s bullets. They gradually vanished as he flew.</p>
<p>The Golden Battle God shot a few more times, but the outcome was the same. Not only did the bullets disappear, but even the Golden Battle God’s body vanished.</p>
<p>The next Golden Battle Gods that appeared were basically the same. Tsukuyomi just stood there without doing anything. The Golden Battle Gods vanished one after another.</p>
<p>“She’s too amazing. As expected of the moon goddess,” an uncultured man shouted at the top of his lungs.</p>
<p>“Is Fairy Chang’e that strong? I don’t think she’s that strong in myths and legends, right?”</p>
<p>“From the myths of the East District, although Chang’e is very famous, her status is far inferior to Dragon Turtle.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it too arbitrary to say that she’s Chang’e now? Even if she’s really Chang’e, I don’t think she’s stronger than the Dragon Turtle.”</p>
<p>The women were more rational. Most of them insisted that the Dragon Turtle was stronger.</p>
<p>When the host saw that many people were doubting Professor Gu, he continued asking, “Professor Gu, many people in the audience believe that the Dragon Turtle’s status in mythology is higher than Chang’e’s. What do you think?”</p>
<p>Professor Gu nodded and said, “Just from its mythological status and contributions, the Dragon Turtle is indeed higher. However, you can’t just look at one aspect…”</p>
<p>While Professor Gu was explaining, the alarms at the six doors had already sounded. The sound drowned Professor Gu’s voice, so he had no choice but to stop explaining.</p>
<p>In fact, no one was listening to his explanation. Everyone wanted to know if this fairy-like figure from the Moon Palace could withstand the fatal seventh strike.</p>
<p>Of course, there were also people who suspected that Tsukuyomi might not even be able to withstand the first shot.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Only after a gunshot did the humans realize that the creature behind the door had shot its first bullet.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1247'>Chapter 1247: Blocking Bullets</h3>
<p>Everyone’s eyes were trained on Tsukuyomi. Basically, no one could see the trajectory of the bullet. They could only see the outcome.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi was still standing there as before. Her figure hadn’t moved at all, but her left hand was raised. Her slender middle finger and index finger held a long, sharp bullet. The sides of the bullet were dented by her fingers.</p>
<p>Clang! Tsukuyomi released her finger and allowed the bullet to fall to the ground. Her gaze remained calm as she looked at the door that the bullet came from.</p>
<p>“She actually caught it!” Everyone was alarmed. After watching the battles for so long, this was the first time they had seen what the bullet looked like.</p>
<p>Although the bullet had already been deformed, one could still roughly tell that it was a bullet made of black metal and there were some strange patterns on its surface.</p>
<p>However, the patterns couldn’t be identified due to the bullet’s deformity.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>Gunshots sounded one after another. As Tsukuyomi walked towards the door, she gently waved her jade-like palm and bullets were caught between her fingers. In an instant, the first six shots had been fired, but the seventh shot didn’t immediately sound.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi had already walked to the door and extended her palm. Five bullets fell to the ground like the previous bullets.</p>
<p>“Too powerful… Professor Gu is right. This fairy is much stronger than Dragon Turtle…”</p>
<p>“Such a beautiful creature and at the Calamity grade. Do you think a Companion Egg will appear if she’s killed?”</p>
<p>“If a Companion Egg appears, I’ll be the first to snatch it.”</p>
<p>“What right do you have to snatch it? If anyone wants to snatch it, it can only be Thief Sage and Looter King.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to read the comments, nor did he want to hear Professor Gu and the host’s analysis. All his attention was on Tsukuyomi. He was somewhat nervous, unsure if Tsukuyomi could withstand the fatal seventh strike.</p>
<p>No creature had been able to survive the seventh shot to date. Be it Grim Reaper No. 10—who possessed an undying body and immortality, or the Calamity-grade Dragon Turtle, all of them died when hit.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi walked to the door and was about to enter when the seventh shot rang.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the gunshot, everyone shuddered before looking at Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>Some people didn’t even dare to look at Tsukuyomi, afraid that they would see her head explode.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept staring at her. After the gunshot, he couldn’t help but be alarmed when he saw her situation.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi’s fingers had already clamped onto the seventh bullet, but the bullet didn’t lose its strength because of Tsukuyomi’s clamp.</p>
<p>The bullet spun violently between Tsukuyomi’s fingers and rubbed against Tsukuyomi’s Moonlight Force. The head of the bullet lit up due to the excessive heat. From afar, it looked like Tsukuyomi’s fingers were clamping a constantly changing light shuttle.</p>
<p>Her Moonlight Force constantly collided with the bullet, and Tsukuyomi couldn’t completely control the bullet, nor could the bullet continue its trajectory.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi raised her fingers slightly and forcefully changed the trajectory of the bullet, allowing it to fly past her.</p>
<p>As it was too fast, most people couldn’t see clearly after the bullet left Tsukuyomi’s finger. They thought that Tsukuyomi had successfully blocked the fatal seventh shot.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen saw that after the bullet flew over, it circled in the air like a living creature and shot at the back of Tsukuyomi’s head at an even faster speed.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, the eighth shot sounded. Not only did this shot have powerful offensive power, but it also concealed the seventh bullet that had circled back, throwing Tsukuyomi into a pincer attack situation.</p>
<p>Almost at the moment Zhou Wen discovered the turning bullet, he had already used spatial teleportation to arrive on Venus.</p>
<p>Bang! Clang!</p>
<p>After two gunshots, the spectators realized that Tsukuyomi’s fingers had clamped the eighth bullet. And behind Tsukuyomi, an ancient sword blocked the seventh bullet that circled back.</p>
<p>Strangely, when the bullet that could blast apart everything struck the ancient sword’s scabbard, it failed to shatter it. It only sent the ancient sword flying, and the bullet changed its trajectory.</p>
<p>The ancient sword flew out and landed in someone’s hand. When everyone took a closer look, they realized that the person holding the ancient sword was none other than Looter King.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, what’s that ancient sword in Looter King’s hand? It can actually block a Calamity-grade bullet?”</p>
<p>“That’s not an ordinary bullet, but the sure-kill seventh bullet.”</p>
<p>“Could that be a Calamity-grade sword?”</p>
<p>“That’s impossible, right?”</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, what background does Looter King have? He can withstand a Calamity-grade bullet, so why is he looting the spoils of others? Wouldn’t it be fine for him to clear the dimensional zone himself?”</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Zhou Wen in surprise. Zhou Wen was also somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>He knew that he couldn’t block the bullet, and had originally planned on using a harder piece of equipment to block it for Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>The so-called blocking was only to stall for time. He didn’t expect the sword to really block the bullet. All he needed to do was give Tsukuyomi a little extra time.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords, which Zhou Wen had treated as a sacrifice, surprisingly didn’t shatter. It managed to take on the brunt of the seventh bullet.</p>
<p>Is the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords that hard? Zhou Wen was alarmed and delighted.</p>
<p>Ever since he fused the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords, Zhou Wen hadn’t been able to pull it out. He didn’t know how to use it, so he hadn’t used it. Now, using it as cannon fodder had a miraculous effect.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi glanced at Zhou Wen and nodded at him with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that Tsukuyomi had likely recognized him, but in the next second, Tsukuyomi turned around and rushed through the door. She was too fast. Zhou Wen wanted to follow her, but there were already several gunshots inside before it suddenly fell silent.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat. There was dead silence behind the door. Zhou Wen knew that it was probably too late for him to rush in, but he still wanted to take a look and use teleportation to rush in.</p>
<p>However, there were tunnels that extended in all directions. The six doors were connected. Zhou Wen had also rushed in previously in-game.</p>
<p>However, he was killed not long after charging in. He failed to find the dimensional creature that shot the bullets.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen stuck a Substitute Talisman on himself. If he was shot, he would immediately escape.</p>
<p>However, after he rushed into the tunnel and searched for a while, no one attacked him.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen passed through the criss-crossing corridors and arrived in front of a metal palace, he realized that Tsukuyomi was standing there. She didn’t look injured, but Zhou Wen didn’t see the corpse of the dimensional creature.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was feeling puzzled, the metal palace’s door opened with a bang, emitting a resplendent glow.</p>
<p>The people on Earth also saw this scene through the Cube. They were as puzzled as Zhou Wen, unsure what had happened.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen retreated into the tunnel, afraid to be illuminated by the light from the palace. As for Tsukuyomi, she stood there without any intention of dodging.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1248'>Chapter 1248: The Only Name on the Rankings</h3>
<p>The light shone on Tsukuyomi’s body, but nothing abnormal happened. The fiery-red light didn’t seem to have any lethality.</p>
<p>Just as all sorts of questions arose in everyone’s minds, they saw something fly out of the metal palace amidst the crimson red light and slowly land in front of Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>It was a metal ball. What was surprising was that the metal ball looked very similar to Venus.</p>
<p>The moment Tsukuyomi obtained it, the screen of Cube began to change. People couldn’t see the scene in the dimensional zone, nor could they see the scene outside Venus.</p>
<p>The scene that appeared on the Cube wasn’t unfamiliar to everyone. It was the Cube ranking that they had often seen in the past.</p>
<p>From the rankings of one to one hundred, there was only one name.</p>
<p>“Tsukuyomi!” People couldn’t help but recite the name. Only then did they realize that it wasn’t the Chang’e they thought. Few people in the Federation knew this name, but many people overseas knew it.</p>
<p>After all, she was a top deity in a particular pantheon. As long as one knew of this pantheon, there was a high chance that they had heard of her name.</p>
<p>Behind Tsukuyomi, five shiny golden stars appeared.</p>
<p>No one knew what the golden stars meant, nor did anyone know what the situation was.</p>
<p>However, most people had already guessed that the Cube ranking still existed. However, only creatures who had cleared the Venusian dimensional zone had the right to appear on the rankings.</p>
<p>Such a requirement frightened many people.</p>
<p>What was even more infuriating was that they didn’t see the situation after Tsukuyomi entered. This was because after Zhou Wen entered the Venusian dimensional zone, the Cube’s ‘camera’ followed him, so they saw as much as Zhou Wen did.</p>
<p>After Tsukuyomi obtained the metal ball, Zhou Wen suddenly felt a strange force. Then, he found himself at the entrance of the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi also appeared there, still holding the metal ball in her hand.</p>
<p>“Follow me.” Before Zhou Wen could say a word, Tsukuyomi walked over and grabbed his hand, teleporting him away.</p>
<p>However, Tsukuyomi didn’t teleport back to Earth. Instead, she arrived on an asteroid. Zhou Wen’s knowledge of astronomy was ordinary, so he didn’t know which asteroid it was.</p>
<p>However, after using the Singularity Universe to compare, Zhou Wen already knew where he was. They were still in the Solar System and hadn’t left.</p>
<p>“Thank you for saving me,” Tsukuyomi said with a smile—her eyes curving into crescents—as she released her hand.</p>
<p>“Even without me, you could still have caught that bullet, right?” When the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords blocked the bullet, Zhou Wen saw Tsukuyomi’s other hand move.</p>
<p>If his guess was right, Tsukuyomi had actually discovered the bullet that had circled back. Even if Zhou Wen hadn’t saved her, she could have caught it with her strength.</p>
<p>“Without you, I’m afraid it wouldn’t have been that easy to reach the Golden Palace. You’ve been a great help,” Tsukuyomi said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought nothing of it, but from Tsukuyomi’s tone, she didn’t seem to be able to kill the dimensional creature.</p>
<p>“Can you tell me what’s going on?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.</p>
<p>“Naturally not others, but if you want to know, sure.” Tsukuyomi recounted the matter regarding the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen had imagined, Tsukuyomi hadn’t killed the dimensional creature. In fact, there was no need to kill it. As long as one could reach the Golden Palace like Tsukuyomi, they would be considered as clearing the Veniusian dimensional zone. The dimensional creature wouldn’t hunt them down any further.</p>
<p>As for the metal ball, it was indeed a reward for passing the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>“Is that metal ball a Companion Egg?” Zhou Wen asked as he looked at the metal ball in Tsukuyomi’s hand.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi threw the metal ball to Zhou Wen. “Take a look.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen caught the metal ball and realized that the tiny metal ball was shockingly heavy. Furthermore, it had a scorching heat. It was unlikely anyone below the Mythical stage could lift it. Even if one forcefully picked it up, they would be scalded by the high temperature.</p>
<p>Although the metal ball looked very strange, Zhou Wen didn’t sense any vital signs from it. He only saw five golden star-shaped symbols on the metal ball.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t look like a Companion Egg. What is it?” Zhou Wen returned the metal ball to Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>“It can be said to be a Companion Egg, but also not one,” Tsukuyomi said as she played with the metal ball.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled, unsure what Tsukuyomi meant.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi explained, “This metal ball is a product of the Venusian dimensional zone, but it’s not the only one. All creatures who can reach the Golden Palace can obtain a similar ball.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Tsukuyomi looked at Zhou Wen with a faint smile and said, “If you can reach the Golden Palace, you will also be able to obtain such a ball. When the time comes, many creatures will obtain the same metal ball. After everything ends, most of the metal balls will become useless. Only a few of them will become Companion Eggs, but there’s only one true Companion Egg.”</p>
<p>“There’s only one true Companion Egg. Could it be…” Zhou Wen realized something as his expression changed slightly.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi saw through Zhou Wen’s thoughts. “From the looks of it, you’ve probably figured it out. That’s right. The Venusian dimensional zone’s appearance isn’t for killing, but to find a home for the Companion Beast inside Venus. Only the strongest creature has the right to obtain its recognition and become its host.”</p>
<p>“What will happen to Venus when that Companion Beast has an owner?” Zhou Wen asked with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>“What do you think will happen if a Companion Beast breaks out of its shell?” Tsukuyomi said.</p>
<p>“Will Venus will be destroyed?” Zhou Wen knew that he had guessed correctly.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi nodded. “Perhaps this is a path that every planet has to experience. The billions of planets in the universe are actually huge Companion Eggs, but brute force is insufficient to obtain them. Every planet has its own unique way of survival. When the Companion Beasts inside them are about to hatch, they will find an owner for themselves.”</p>
<p>“Is it the same for Earth?” Although Zhou Wen already knew the answer, he couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>“In theory, all the planets in the Universe are the same. However, Earth seems to be somewhat special because there are too many dimensional zones there. Up to now, no one knows which dimensional zone is the one to obtain Earth’s Companion Beast,” Tsukuyomi said after some thought.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen finally had a clear idea in mind. If Earth was like Venus—a huge Companion Egg—then the dimensional zones on Earth might be the same as the Venusian dimensional zone. They were produced to select the ownership of Earth’s Companion Beast.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, there were too many dimensional zones on Earth. There were so many that it was unknown which dimensional zone was the true test for Earth’s Companion Beast.</p>
<p>The dimension kept searching, but they clearly failed to find it.</p>
<p>“What’s the level of the true Venusian Companion Beast? A Calamity-grade?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought. He was very curious about this matter.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1249'>Chapter 1249: Sword of Unkilling</h3>
<p>“Who knows? I just came out and don’t know much,” Tsukuyomi said.</p>
<p>“Previously, those creatures seemed to know that they were doomed, but they still rushed into the Venusian dimensional zone. Do you know why?” Zhou Wen had always been concerned about this matter.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Perhaps they weren’t happy and had a death wish,” Tsukuyomi said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Tsukuyomi for a while without saying a word. He felt that Tsukuyomi definitely knew something, but was unwilling to tell him. He didn’t have the ability to read minds, so all he could do was give up.</p>
<p>“Thank you for saving me. I’m very happy, but this place isn’t suitable for you. Go back,” Tsukuyomi said as she stood up.</p>
<p>“What dangers are there in the Universe?” Zhou Wen pressed.</p>
<p>“You will naturally know when you obtain Calamity grade power.” Tsukuyomi turned around and flew away from the asteroid. Only her cold voice passed through the vacuum and entered Zhou Wen’s ears. “Don’t leave Earth unless it’s really necessary.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to ask why, but Tsukuyomi had already vanished.</p>
<p>What’s in the Universe that can make a powerful Calamity-grade existence so afraid, to the point of being terrified? Zhou Wen looked up at the cosmos, but he couldn’t see anything from the asteroid.</p>
<p>After entering the Universe more times, Zhou Wen learned something. The stars that he could see on Earth were invisible on many other planets.</p>
<p>After teleporting back to Earth, Zhou Wen was lucky to appear near Luoyang and quickly returned.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was Zhou Wen’s imagination, but Luoyang seemed to have become more prosperous than before. People came and went as shops lined the streets.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen quickly realized that it wasn’t an illusion. Many shops were newly opened, ones he had never seen before.</p>
<p>After some thought, he roughly gathered what was going on. The various factions were definitely trying their best to figure out what the An family’s aurora was.</p>
<p>If tough tactics didn’t work, they would have to think of other ways. Now, in the massive Luoyang, there were countless people from all walks of life who were spies of other factions.</p>
<p>After returning to his room, Zhou Wen couldn’t wait to summon the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords. He wanted to figure out why the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords could block the fatal seventh bullet.</p>
<p>In theory, it was impossible for the Terror-grade Son of Heaven’s Three Swords to withstand a Calamity strike without suffering any damage. Furthermore, the bullet wasn’t an ordinary Calamity strike.</p>
<p>Even so, the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords hadn’t been damaged.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen studied the various abilities and skills of the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords one by one, hoping to find the reason why it hadn’t shattered. This also meant that he could reverse engineer the seventh bullet’s ability.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen wasn’t the only one studying the matter. The various factions were also studying how Looter King could block the seventh bullet.</p>
<p>Through Tsukuyomi’s battle, many people realized that the seventh bullet was especially powerful. The eighth bullet she subsequently caught wasn’t as potent.</p>
<p>Yet, a bullet as strong as the seventh had been blocked by the ancient sword. They wanted to know what Companion Beast the ancient sword was, what abilities it had, and if they could find a replacement.</p>
<p>The various factions were studying this aspect, but no one recognized the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords in Zhou Wen’s hand.</p>
<p>In fact, there was no such thing as the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords in reality. Even if they went to the Ancient Sword Tomb and had heaven-defying luck, they would, at most, obtain the Light Concealment, Shadow Concealment, or the Night Immaculate Sword.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen obtained the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords through fusion, so it was impossible for it to drop.</p>
<p>Unable to figure out the origins of the ancient sword, the various factions attempted to find Looter King, even if they had to cooperate with him.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no one knew who Looter King was. The members of the media were guessing, but no one guessed Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The information regarding the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords was very vague and had little value for reference. Zhou Wen studied it for hours and felt that it might have something to do with its Wheel of Destiny—Sword of Unkilling.</p>
<p>Could it be that this Sword of Unkilling doesn’t mean that it can’t kill, but that it can’t be killed? After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that this was the most likely possibility.</p>
<p>In fact, its Life Providence, Life Soul, and Terror Transformation were all abilities related to the Son of Heaven. He didn’t know what they were for, but they didn’t seem to have anything to do with immortality.</p>
<p>If it’s really as I guessed, this sword can’t be killed. It’s not that I can’t use it to kill, so why can’t I pull it out? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Unable to figure it out, and it being the time for the Venusian instance dungeon to respawn, Zhou Wen took the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords into the Venusian instance dungeon to see if he could use it to block the Calamity-grade bullet and thereby, rush to the Golden Palace.</p>
<p>He had already learned the route to the Golden Palace from Tsukuyomi. As long as he could block a few bullets, he could rush in.</p>
<p>As for killing the dimensional creature that was firing, Zhou Wen no longer held any hope.</p>
<p>Even Tsukuyomi couldn’t kill it, so Zhou Wen could forget about it. After all, he wasn’t even at the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Using the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords to kill the Metal Guard was the same as before. He couldn’t pull it out and could only use it as a pole. With Zhou Wen’s strength, he had to use it to whack the Metal Guard.</p>
<p>One thing was certain. This sword could kill—it wasn’t a sword that couldn’t kill as Zhou Wen had previously imagined.</p>
<p>However, other than being hard, the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords didn’t have any other augmented abilities.</p>
<p>It was difficult for Zhou Wen to even kill the Golden Battle God with it. He failed to kill the Golden Battle God despite ‘slashing’ at it several times.</p>
<p>Despite both being at the Terror grade, the destructive power of the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords was much weaker than the Asura Saber formed by Deva Asura.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen didn’t expect to use it for killing. He only hoped to use its strength to block the Calamity-grade existence’s bullets.</p>
<p>Although the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords was hard enough, Zhou Wen still needed to be able to hit the bullet to block the Calamity-grade existence’s bullets.</p>
<p>Due to the difference in speed, Zhou Wen would be killed by a single shot when he accurately teleported or phased into existence from a teleportation. It wasn’t easy to use the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords to block the bullets.</p>
<p>I have to focus and use all means to determine the trajectory of the bullet. I have to prepare to block the bullet in advance. Otherwise, it will definitely be too late by the time I see it. After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that there was only one way to block the Calamity-grade existence’s bullets.</p>
<p>When fighting the Golden Battle Gods, Zhou Wen didn’t use all his strength to quickly kill them. Instead, he used their shots to practice blocking bullets.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen engraved all the Terror-grade powers that could strengthen his perceptive abilities.</p>
<p>Great Brahma and Human Sovereign appeared at the same time. One protected the blood-colored avatar while the other fused with its body.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1250'>Chapter 1250: Practice Method</h3>
<p>Although the bullets shot by the Golden Battle God were very fast and powerful, they had different attributes.</p>
<p>However, such attacks didn’t pose much of a threat to Zhou Wen. His reaction and speed could keep up with the bullet’s speed, so after practicing for a while, Zhou Wen knew that there was no point in continuing. There wouldn’t be any improvement.</p>
<p>After using the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords to block all sorts of bullets, he was very certain that the sword was hard. When bullets of different attributes hit the ancient sword, even the scabbard wasn’t damaged.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I can only get an effect by receiving the Calamity-grade bullets. Otherwise, it would be a waste of effort no matter how much I train. After thinking through everything, Zhou Wen killed the Golden Battle Gods one by one, prepared to see if he could block the Calamity-grade bullet.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen really wished that he had the Eye of Odin. That way, he could have recorded the firing process and slowly replayed it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen didn’t have that ability, so he had to figure it out during the process.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already tried quite a number of times, but he was killed every time. None of it was an accident. Not only could he not block it, but he couldn’t even keep up with its speed. He couldn’t even dodge.</p>
<p>Now that he had the tough Son of Heaven’s Three Swords, he should be able to block it, but it was a problem if he could get the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords to make contact with the bullet.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, it was impossible to touch it, but Zhou Wen didn’t plan on giving up. Before finishing off the last Golden Battle God, Zhou Wen summoned his Terror-grade Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>After Banana Fairy, the three Golden Battle Gods, Deva Asura, and Grim Reaper No. 10 were summoned, Zhou Wen started carving marks.</p>
<p>Terror power immediately surged through Zhou Wen. No, to be precise, it surged into the armor formed by the Limitless Demon Dragon King.</p>
<p>The black crystal-like armor emitted a terrifying glow due to the immense energy. It was as though the black crystal was burning.</p>
<p>The Limitless Demon Dragon King’s functions played a role, sharing their powers with Zhou Wen. Now, he had an additional six Terror-grade powers. Together with his Terror transformation powers, Zhou Wen now grasped unprecedented power.</p>
<p>With this power, Zhou Wen held the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords tightly and welcomed the Calamity-grade bullets.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen’s reaction was very fast, the shot blasted his head apart before he could swing his sword.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because the Dragon King armor had gathered immense strength, the Calamity creature treated him as its first target. After one shot, nothing was left.</p>
<p>It still doesn’t work? Zhou Wen deeply understood the difference between a Calamity and a Terror-grade existence.</p>
<p>He had obtained the augmentation of six Terror-grade powers, but he couldn’t even block an ordinary bullet, much less the sure-kill seventh bullet.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t as though Zhou Wen had gained nothing. With the augmentation of powerful strength and the enhancement of Great Brahma and Human Sovereign’s perception, Zhou Wen could roughly see the trajectory of the bullet, but he couldn’t dodge it.</p>
<p>Strange. Previously, when I used the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords to block the bullet for Tsukuyomi, I could clearly do it. Why don’t I have time to block an ordinary bullet for myself? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and understood why he couldn’t block it.</p>
<p>Previously, helping Tsukuyomi block the bullet was actually a form of prediction. When he saw the bullet turn, he had already predicted that the bullet would shoot towards the back of Tsukuyomi’s head. Therefore, he could throw the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords ahead of time.</p>
<p>However, when it was his turn to block the bullet, although he knew that the bullet would definitely shoot at him, he didn’t know where it would go. The Son of Heaven’s Three Swords couldn’t block his entire body. Without any predictions, it was impossible for him to block a Calamity-grade bullet by relying on reaction alone.</p>
<p>The Limitless Demon Dragon King armor allows me to draw upon the powers of eight creatures. This time, I only used six. I’ll try getting eight next time. Perhaps I can block it then. Zhou Wen was considering what Companion Beasts to use.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen grinded the dungeons, he thought about the trajectory of the bullet he had seen today, as well as his prediction when helping Tsukuyomi block the bullet.</p>
<p>That bullet appears and disappears unpredictably. I can’t even see the shooter, making it difficult to predict the trajectory. Is there no way to predict the trajectory of the bullet without seeing the shooter? Zhou Wen practiced in-game as he thought.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, what are you doing?” When An Sheng came to find Zhou Wen, he saw him gesturing with his bare hands. He did not know what he was doing, so he asked.</p>
<p>“I’m practicing my swordplay,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“How can you train like that? What’s the point of gesturing with your fingers? How can it compare with real weapon practice?” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“I also want to practice with something real, but no one has such a fast attack speed that can pressure me.” Zhou Wen was telling the truth, but it sounded arrogant to others.</p>
<p>An Sheng understood Zhou Wen’s character and knew that he wasn’t an arrogant person. He asked in puzzlement, “How fast do you want it?”</p>
<p>“It’s about the same as the bullet fired by the Calamity-grade creature in the Venusian dimensional zone,” Zhou Wen said casually. He didn’t believe that An Sheng could help him find a Calamity-grade sparring partner.</p>
<p>“You only want speed, and have no other requirements on strength?” An Sheng asked again.</p>
<p>“No, as long as it’s fast enough. However, with such speed, it’s definitely at the Calamity grade. It’s impossible for creatures below the Calamity grade to have such speed,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to use humans for this matter. Just machines can resolve it. Humans definitely can’t reach such speeds, but machines can. If you only need speed and not strength or other requirements, you don’t need complicated machinery. Just a torchlight will do,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head and said, “I’ve thought of that as well. The speed of light is naturally fast, but it’s impossible for the person using the flashlight to be that fast. As long as I see him use a flashlight to illuminate me, I can easily dodge the beam from determining his actions.”</p>
<p>“There’s a model of the compressed accelerator in the military laboratory. Although it’s a model, the principle is the same as the real deal. As long as you input the procedure properly ahead of time, it will shoot out light according to that procedure. You can’t tell what the machine is doing, right?” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Is it convenient for you to lend me that thing?” After Zhou Wen listened to An Sheng’s detailed description of the model’s principle, he felt that this method might really work.</p>
<p>He followed An Sheng to the military laboratory of the Sunset Army and began a new round of practice.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1251'>Chapter 1251: Speed of Light</h3>
<p>“You call this a model?” Zhou Wen looked at the device in front of him that was the size of a tractor and asked An Sheng with an odd expression.</p>
<p>“It’s a model. It’s only 1/25th the size of the real deal. However, because it’s used in simulation experiments, its basic theory and functions are about the same as the real one. The only difference is that it’s a little weaker and doesn’t have the functions that are used in practice.” An Sheng pointed at the device and explained, “Although it’s a little weaker, you can’t say the same about its speed. It can’t even be dodged at the Terror grade. It’s perfect if you want to practice with it.”</p>
<p>“How do I operate this thing?” Zhou Wen looked at the device that resembled a tractor’s cockpit and had a headache.</p>
<p>“Although there’s a computer that can set the launch parameters, it’s still an experimental product. In order to prevent any accidents, someone needs to be at the operating console. However, this thing can’t be seen by others at the moment, so there are only four non-staff who have the authority to come here. Only I can help you.” An Sheng went to the operating console.</p>
<p>Soon, the front end of the device that looked like a tractor lit up. In front of it was a black crystal in the shape of a fence. On careful look, the fence was made of tiny hexagonal crystals.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen… I’m going to start firing… You have to be careful…” An Sheng shouted.</p>
<p>“Bring it on.” Zhou Wen chose a suitable distance to stand and looked at the shiny crystal opposite him.</p>
<p>There was no sound, nor were there any signs as one of the hexagonal crystals shot out a beam. It was different from the light-type skills used by ordinary humans. It was the true speed of light.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s chest was struck by the light—his body didn’t even move.</p>
<p>The might of the beam wasn’t high. Most of it was equivalent to a Legendary attack. Even Zhou Wen’s armor wasn’t injured.</p>
<p>The speed of light is indeed about the same as that Calamity-grade bullet. Zhou Wen was very satisfied with the model’s beam speed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the hexagonal crystals were akin to gun barrels. Under An Sheng’s control, beams shot out from different crystals. As they were controlled by the computer, Zhou Wen couldn’t predict them in advance. All he could do was wait for the beams to shoot out before reacting.</p>
<p>He tried many times, but he failed every time. Even if Zhou Wen used the Demon Dragon King armor and used the power of the Terror-grade Companion Beasts, he could only see the beams shoot out, but it was already too late to dodge.</p>
<p>The speed of light is just too fast. With my present speed, I can’t even dodge, much less block it with my sword—unless the other party directly targets the Son of Heaven Sword. Zhou Wen repeated his attempts and quickly confirmed that it was impossible to block the beam with speed unless he advanced to the Terror grade and had the help of eight Terror-grade Companion Beasts. Only then could he react and block the beam in time.</p>
<p>Since speed isn’t enough, I’ll have to think of another way. As Zhou Wen thought, he attempted to block the beam with his reaction.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, it’s not feasible to rely on human reaction and speed to block the speed of light at such a distance. The Overseer has also tried, but he can’t dodge the speed of light,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>An Sheng knew very well that such attempts were futile. If one wasn’t fast enough, they just weren’t fast enough. If one was too lacking, it wasn’t something that could be made up through hard work.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally knew that training alone wasn’t enough. However, after hearing An Sheng’s words, his eyes suddenly lit up. He looked at An Sheng and asked, “Ah Sheng, what did you just say?”</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, I’m not trying to put you down about your speed, but at your present speed, it’s impossible for you to dodge a light-speed attack,” Ah Sheng said truthfully. He didn’t give any unrealistic flattery just because he had a good relationship with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“No, you just said that you can’t block the speed of light at such a distance. In other words, if you are far enough away, you can block the speed of light?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“If we assume that the distance is far enough, there will be a time difference, so you should be able to block it. However, the distance needed is just too great. It’s very difficult to pull away to such a distance. Furthermore, there’s another drawback. At such a distance, you won’t be able to see it before the light arrives. When you can see the light, it will already be there. Therefore, this is only a hypothesis,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Although it’s only a hypothesis, it’s not impossible. It’s still possible to exchange space for time,” Zhou Wen muttered to himself.</p>
<p>However, just as An Sheng had said, the speed of light was too fast. Light could travel sufficiently far with just a tenth of a second.</p>
<p>Interstellar teleportation could open up such a distance in a short period of time, but there was no such distance available for Zhou Wen in the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was good at spatial powers. Perhaps he could give it a try and use spatial skills to widen the distance.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully considered the various abilities of the Godfiend Era and Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping. From his present spatial skills, he couldn’t extend space.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously seen Jiuyue use spatial extension. Since someone could do it, it meant that there was definitely such a spatial skill.</p>
<p>“Where can I get such a spatial skill?” Zhou Wen told An Sheng his idea.</p>
<p>An Sheng thought for a moment and said, “I don’t know if this method works, but we don’t have dimensional zones that produce such spatial skills here. Even if other places produce them, they will definitely be very rare. Furthermore, we can only buy Mythical skill crystals at most. No one at the Terror grade will sell them.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine if it’s at the Mythical stage. How can I buy it?” Zhou Wen thought that since Liu Yun could cultivate Star Stealer to the Terror grade, he could give it a try.</p>
<p>“We can only try our luck at the Holy City’s Fireworks Lane. It’s the only place that’s most likely to have it. Even if the other families have it, they won’t casually sell it,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t unfamiliar with the Holy City’s Fireworks Lane. He had been there before. The Faceless Buddha in Fireworks Lane was his classmate, Gu Dian.</p>
<p>Upon hearing An Sheng’s words, Zhou Wen attempted to send Gu Dian a message, explaining his intention of buying a spatial skill crystal.</p>
<p>Before long, Gu Dian replied to his message. “There are spatial skill crystals. The ones you mentioned don’t exist. No one will sell them even if they do.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately disappointed. Although spatial skills weren’t something that couldn’t be created by oneself, the difficulty of creating them was as difficult as humans discovering the periodic law of elements in the past. It required luck and constant research to achieve it. It wasn’t something that could be done with just a thought.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Gu Dian sent a second message. “I know of a place that can produce such spatial skill crystals. The drop rate is very low. If you aren’t afraid of trouble or death, you can give it a try.”</p>
<p>“Where is it?” Zhou Wen was delighted as he hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“West District, Time Hut.” Gu Dian quickly replied.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1252'>Chapter 1252: Time Hut</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen’s smile froze when he saw the words ‘Time Hut.’</p>
<p>He had heard of this dimensional zone before, and it wasn’t just him. There were probably very few people on Earth who didn’t know about the Time Hut dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Many mainstream media had reported on the Time Hut dimensional zone. In that dimensional zone, the flow of time was completely different from the outside world.</p>
<p>There had been people who went in for a moment—turning from young men to dying old men. There were also old men who turned into babies after entering.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the flow of time inside was unpredictable. Whether one could come out after entering didn’t depend on how powerful one was, but on one’s luck.</p>
<p>It might be better for experts who were proficient in temporal powers to enter the Time Hut, but Zhou Wen wasn’t good at temporal abilities.</p>
<p>“Isn’t Time Hut a temporal dimensional zone? Why does it have a spatial skill?” Zhou Wen asked Gu Dian for more detail.</p>
<p>Gu Dian sent the information regarding Time Hut to Zhou Wen. It was clearly confidential information. Most of the content hadn’t been reported by the media, and it was highly detailed.</p>
<p>Although the Time Hut was called a hut, there were actually many rooms inside. The flow of time in every room was different. Some of the rooms had been explored before and the flow of time inside was known.</p>
<p>As for some rooms, none of the humans who entered had managed to come out. Therefore, no one knew the situation inside.</p>
<p>Even in the known rooms, the flow of time was variable.</p>
<p>The spatial skill crystal Gu Dian mentioned belonged to a Mythical creature named Spacetime Piglet in one of the rooms.</p>
<p>According to Gu Dian’s information, Spacetime Piglet had temporal and spatial skills. Someone had obtained a spatial skill after killing a Spacetime Piglet. Later on, that skill was sold to Cave Era. Cave Era had once used that skill, and it indeed had the ability to extend space.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen planned on heading to the Time Hut to take a look. It was too risky to enter the Time Hut, but he wanted to see if there was a tiny palm symbol there.</p>
<p>If he had the tiny palm symbol and could download the dungeon, he could farm in-game to his heart’s content. It shouldn’t be difficult to obtain a skill crystal.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, aren’t you going to continue?” An Sheng hurriedly shouted when he saw that Zhou Wen was about to leave.</p>
<p>“I’ll be heading out for a while. I’ll train when I’m back.” Zhou Wen was in a rush to head to the Time Hut as he continued walking out.</p>
<p>An Sheng moved his mouth as though he wanted to say something, but he ultimately didn’t.</p>
<p>After leaving the base with Zhou Wen, An Sheng shook his head helplessly when he saw Zhou Wen’s figure vanish. “Doesn’t this fellow have any human needs like entertainment or emotion?”</p>
<p>The distance to the West District was relatively far, but to Zhou Wen who had the ability to teleport, it was virtually nothing. Furthermore, it wasn’t as risky for him compared to others.</p>
<p>He took Ya’er with him to the West District as a vacation.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Ever since Tsukuyomi had cleared the Venusian instance dungeon, no other creatures had entered. All the major factions were making preparations. The most important job was to capture Thief Sage.</p>
<p>Apart from obtaining the Dragon Turtle Companion Egg, they also wanted to use Thief Sage’s spatial teleportation ability to help them clear the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>The creatures in space never appeared again. The angel with black wings from before never reappeared.</p>
<p>Strange; even Tsukuyomi has appeared. Why didn’t the black-winged angel enter the Venusian dimensional zone? Could it be that not all creatures in space are restricted? Zhou Wen guessed.</p>
<p>In fact, after Zhou Wen obtained Grim Reaper No. 10, he had been wondering if he could obtain another angel Companion Beast. To his surprise, the black-winged angel hadn’t appeared.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen released Ice Maiden and Jade Rabbit, while Demonic Neonate and Ya’er sat on the Earth Elemental Beast’s back. They weren’t far from the Time Hut and there weren’t many people around, so Zhou Wen let them out for a breather.</p>
<p>“What’s this place? It looks pretty good.” Grim Demon was seldom released. He had the excitement of having just been released from prison. Everything looked fresh.</p>
<p>“The Peninsula of Gods,” Zhou Wen answered casually.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been to the Peninsula of Gods before. He had obtained Medusa and the Golden Battle God Halberd, as well as the Invisibility Cloak here.</p>
<p>Meeting Zhong Ziya seemed like yesterday, but now, the two of them were separated. No one knew if they would have the chance to meet again in the future.</p>
<p>I wonder how Lucas is now. Zhou Wen thought of the fellow known as a hero.</p>
<p>Five years ago, Lucas often sent him messages, but ever since Zhou Wen had been trapped for five years, he hadn’t received any messages from him.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Zhou Wen really missed that fellow. Such a person would always leave an indelible impression.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the human city closest to the Time Hut, they saw many humans walking on the streets with their Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Trolls, elemental sprites, sea demons, and so on. There were all sorts of strange Companion Beasts that were too much for the eyes to take in. In contrast, the Companion Beasts Zhou Wen brought looked rather ordinary.</p>
<p>“How do I get to Time Hut?” Zhou Wen bought some things from a shop and asked the boss the way to Time Hut.</p>
<p>He only knew that the Time Hut was in a forest, but he didn’t know its exact location.</p>
<p>“As a foreigner, it’s best to hire a guide to lead you to the Time Hut. Otherwise, it’s very easy to get lost in the strange forest.” The boss was very enthusiastic when he saw how generous Zhou Wen was with his purchases.</p>
<p>“Do you have a map?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s cheap. Twenty bucks for one, but the path in the strange forest always changes. Having a map isn’t much different from not having one. Only an experienced guide can quickly find the location of the Time Hut.” The boss handed a map to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took the map and looked at it. He saw that the map was rather detailed. It indicated the path to the strange forest. However, although the map in the strange forest was very detailed, there were many annotations. It indicated that paths might not exist at times and could only be used as a reference.</p>
<p>This was enough for Zhou Wen. After putting away the map, Zhou Wen asked, “Where in the Peninsula of Gods is Hero Lucas in?”</p>
<p>“What Hero Lucas?” The boss was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>“It’s that famous hero who once killed Medusa.” Zhou Wen was slightly surprised that someone on the Peninsula of Gods didn’t recognize Lucas.</p>
<p>When the boss heard that, he thought carefully for a while before saying in enlightenment, “There seems to be such a person. However, it happened many years ago. There are so many heroes nowadays. We don’t remember people from so long ago that well. Now, the most famous hero on our Peninsula of Gods is Boss…”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1253'>Chapter 1253: Tai Sui’s Evolution</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled as he asked a few more people. He realized that none of them knew about Lucas. Even if they knew, they only had a vague awareness of him. No one knew what had happened to Lucas.</p>
<p>Strange. With Lucas’s personality, it’s impossible for him to lead a quiet life, right? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and sent a message to Lucas, but he didn’t get a reply.</p>
<p>Could something have happened to this fellow? Zhou Wen flipped through the news. The reports regarding Lucas were from four years ago. There weren’t any reports about him in the past four years.</p>
<p>It was as though Lucas had vanished, but there was no report of what had happened to him.</p>
<p>Although it was normal for humans to die accidentally in this era, it still made Zhou Wen feel uncomfortable when he thought of how he had lost someone he knew.</p>
<p>He took the map and headed for the strange forest. The strange forest was a dimensional zone, and the Time Hut could be considered a part of the strange forest.</p>
<p>As it was very dangerous, not many humans came here.</p>
<p>The only good thing about the strange forest was that there were only plant-type dimensional creatures here. Plant-type dimensional creatures were typically unable to move, so as long as one didn’t enter a specific radius, there wouldn’t be much danger.</p>
<p>However, plant-type dimensional creatures were mixed among ordinary plants. It wasn’t easy to discover them, so it was normal to accidentally approach them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s senses were extremely sharp, so it wasn’t difficult for him to distinguish plant-type dimensional creatures. After walking into the strange forest, he immediately discovered many plant-type dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Their sizes ranged from a blade of grass, a mushroom to a towering tree—all of them could be a dimensional creature.</p>
<p>Furthermore, plant-type dimensional creatures typically didn’t have powerful auras. It was difficult for ordinary people to tell which were dimensional creatures and which were ordinary plants.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that some mosses were dimensional creatures. With a thought, he summoned Tai Sui.</p>
<p>After Tai Sui discovered the moss, it excitedly rushed over and quickly devoured a large patch of it.</p>
<p>It had been eating the Dragon King Gu for the past few years and seemed to be sick of it. Now that there was a change in flavor, it looked very happy.</p>
<p>Tai Sui, who was like a huge white ball, bounced ahead and led the way. The spore-type dimensional creatures in the air were also devoured by Tai Sui.</p>
<p>To others, the strange forest might be a death zone, but to Zhou Wen, it wasn’t that dangerous. It was similar to a vegetable plot he could call his own.</p>
<p>Ya’er even plucked a few dimensional creature flowers. They didn’t dare resist or attack.</p>
<p>“The scenery here isn’t bad. It would be better if there was some alcohol.” Having been finally released, Grim Demon found everything pretty good.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate didn’t react at all. She was completely uninterested in the beautiful vista.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden carried Jade Rabbit in its smallest form and sized up her surroundings with her beautiful eyes, wary of any danger that might appear. She didn’t like this place that was filled with vitality. Only the ice world made her feel comfortable.</p>
<p>Such a place made her feel uncomfortable. The thought of the various bacteria caking the plants left her in distress.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen compared the map and walked forward. He realized that the map was indeed wrong. There were many routes and references marked on the map, but didn’t exist in reality.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to use Truth Listener’s ability to search for the Time Hut. Unfortunately, he didn’t discover it within Truth Listener’s range of detection.</p>
<p>The entourage could only slowly search. After walking for a short distance, Tai Sui, that was bouncing in front, suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Zhou Wen and company walked over and realized that there was a tree in front of Tai Sui. There was a fist-sized hole at its root. Tai Sui seemed to be very interested in the tree hole.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for the fact that it didn’t dare take action without Zhou Wen’s orders, it would have long burrowed in.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to observe what was inside the tree hole and quickly realized that it extended deep underground. The roots below were intertwined, and a huge cavern appeared more than ten meters below.</p>
<p>The empty space was rather large. The entire top was the tree’s roots, and there were some strange dimensional creatures growing below that looked like some mushroom variant but appeared harder.</p>
<p>It didn’t look like a Ganoderma lingzhi. Above the jade-like stem, there were some green teeth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what dimensional creature it was, but Tai Sui had already rushed in.</p>
<p>Its body was much bigger than the hole, but Tai Sui could change its size at will. Its body liquefied, turning into long, snake-like strips that drilled into the hole.</p>
<p>After entering the tree hole, Tai Sui began devouring the strange creatures without restraint. The strange creatures didn’t dare resist as they trembled and were devoured by Tai Sui without any resistance.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could figure out what they were, Tai Sui had already devoured them all.</p>
<p>Tai Sui burrowed out of the ground and black-gray matter secreted from its body before Zhou Wen could figure out what it had devoured.</p>
<p>Before long, Tai Sui’s entire body was enveloped by a layer of extremely hard black ash, as though it had turned into a black-gray ball of rock.</p>
<p>Has Tai Sui evolved? Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. This had happened too suddenly and too easily. He was a little at a loss.</p>
<p>Seeing that Tai Sui didn’t react, nor did he know when it could complete its evolution, he stored it in the Chaos Bead.</p>
<p>“There’s someone over there,” Grim Demon said as he looked in a direction in the forest.</p>
<p>“Go over and take a look. If there’s really someone, I might be able to find out where the Time Hut is.” Zhou Wen also sensed a group of humans as he walked over with Ya’er in his arms.</p>
<p>Before long, they saw a group of people walking over. When they saw Zhou Wen and company, they wore wary expressions.</p>
<p>It might not be a good thing for humans to encounter their kind in a strange forest.</p>
<p>“May I ask where the Time Hut is?” Zhou Wen didn’t care what they thought as he asked.</p>
<p>The leading elder sized up Zhou Wen and company for a while before saying, “Are you foreigners? If you want to go to the Time Hut, it’s best you hire a guide. Otherwise, something might happen.”</p>
<p>“If possible, can you tell me the general direction and location of the Time Hut?” Zhou Wen naturally wasn’t afraid of any danger. Unless a Calamity-grade creature appeared, it was hard for any ordinary dimensional creature to injure him.</p>
<p>The elder was about to say something when a young man in the team pointed in a direction and said, “The Time Hut is over there. If you aren’t afraid of death, feel free to head over.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could tell from his tone that something had happened at the Time Hut.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1254'>Chapter 1254: Lucas’s Friend</h3>
<p>“Did something happen at the Time Hut?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>The elder leading the group was very friendly. When he heard that, he said, “There’s nothing wrong with the Time Hut. However, on the path to the Time Hut, a terrifying Piranha Flower King appeared. Our team suffered great losses, so it’s best that you don’t proceed.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for the heads up, but we still want to take a look,” Zhou Wen said as he looked at the troll Companion Beast behind their team.</p>
<p>It was a blue-skinned troll. It was four to five meters tall and looked extremely majestic.</p>
<p>On the troll’s back was a box. Zhou Wen hadn’t noticed it at first, but Zhou Wen’s sharp senses noticed it when a sound suddenly came from the box. He immediately realized that there was a woman tied up inside the box.</p>
<p>The woman’s hands and feet were tied up, and she was gagged. At that moment, she seemed to realize that there were others outside. Therefore, she struck the inner wall of the box with all her might, making a sound to let others discover her.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen look at the box, the elder said, “If you insist on going, be careful. We are in a hurry to return.”</p>
<p>“Wait a moment. What’s with the box?” Zhou Wen stopped the elder and asked.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t like being a busybody, Zhou Wen wouldn’t hold back if he could save a life.</p>
<p>Of course, before that, Zhou Wen had to figure out the whole story to prevent a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>“What has it got to do with you?” The young man glared at Zhou Wen unhappily.</p>
<p>However, the elder stopped the young man and said to Zhou Wen, “To be honest, the person in the box is our employer. She spent money to get us to take her to the Time Hut, but now that the Piranha Flower King has appeared on the road, none of us will go past it. A few people have already died, but she still insists on advancing. We don’t want to see her die, so we are forcefully taking her back.”</p>
<p>“Can I ask her a few questions?” Zhou Wen felt that the elder didn’t seem to be lying, but it was better to make things clear as it concerned a life.</p>
<p>“Don’t push your luck.” The young man was very unhappy.</p>
<p>However, the elder stopped the young man from acting up further. He turned his head and said to Zhou Wen, “Of course. Actually, what we did wasn’t right. Since we took her money, we should have taken her to her destination even if death was on the cards. However, it was a clear case of sending her to her death. There was no point in continuing. I’m already an old bag of bones. It’s fine if I die, but I can’t watch these young people die with us. We will refund her the money and double the compensation.”</p>
<p>With that said, the elder got someone to get the box down and open it for Zhou Wen and company to see.</p>
<p>“Dad, what are you doing? Is there a need to explain so much to an outsider?” When Zhou Wen and company looked at the box, the young man complained to the elder unhappily.</p>
<p>The elder whispered, “You’re being silly. These foreigners know nothing about the strange forest. They don’t even know the location of the Time Hut, but they were able to reach here safely. There must be extremely powerful existences among them. We can’t be rash.”</p>
<p>The young man was alarmed as he came to a realization. He glanced at Zhou Wen and company who were sizing up the box and whispered, “I see. I was too careless.”</p>
<p>“You are still young. After gaining more experience, you will naturally be able to see a clearer picture of things. Just think before you act in the future.” The elder patted the young man on the shoulder and led him towards Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>The box had already been opened. Inside was indeed a woman tied up.</p>
<p>The elder went over and removed the gag from the woman’s mouth. The woman immediately shouted, “Hatu, you ungrateful bastard. Lucas took good care of you back when he was still around, right? Yet, you are treating me like this?”</p>
<p>“Philo, it’s not that we don’t want to take you there. We really can’t deal with that Piranha Flower King. If we go, we’ll just be sending ourselves to our deaths. What’s the point?” the elder said helplessly as he spread out his hands.</p>
<p>“If you’re afraid of death, that’s your business. Why are you stopping me?” Philo struggled to get out of the box.</p>
<p>However, her body was tied up like a worm. She couldn’t even stand up and could only lie in the box and talk.</p>
<p>“We don’t want you to die either,” the elder explained.</p>
<p>“I think it’s because you don’t want your reputation to be damaged, right?” Philo snorted coldly.</p>
<p>“What’s your relationship with Lucas?” Zhou Wen asked Philo. He was somewhat surprised to hear her mention Lucas’s name.</p>
<p>Philo knew that she had a chance to speak because of Zhou Wen. When she saw Zhou Wen ask about Lucas, she hurriedly said, “I’m Lucas’s fiancée. Do you know Lucas?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hadn’t heard Lucas mention a fiancée. After some thought, he asked, “Why are you going to the Time Hut?”</p>
<p>“To find Lucas, of course. He went to the Time Hut four years ago and hasn’t returned since. I have to find him.” Philo gritted her teeth and said, “If all of you are afraid of death and aren’t willing to go, let me go. I’ll go myself. I won’t implicate you.”</p>
<p>“Let her go,” Zhou Wen said to the elder.</p>
<p>“This…” The elder was somewhat hesitant. Although part of the reason was to not have his employer die for his team’s reputation, the primary reason was that he didn’t want Philo to die. After all, just as she had said, Lucas had taken good care of him in the past.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. We’ll take her to the Time Hut,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You know Lucas?” the elder looked at Zhou Wen and asked carefully.</p>
<p>“I’m proud to have the Great Lucas as a friend,” Zhou Wen said sincerely. A person like Lucas was indeed worthy of respect.</p>
<p>The elder was still hesitating when Philo shouted in delight, “Quickly release me. I’ll go with them.”</p>
<p>The elder sized up Zhou Wen for a while and sighed. He got someone to remove the chains on Philo.</p>
<p>After Philo jumped out of the box, she said to Zhou Wen, “What’s your name? I’ve basically seen all of Lucas’s friends, but I’ve never seen you before.”</p>
<p>“My name is Zhou Wen. Perhaps he hasn’t mentioned me, but I’m indeed his friend,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You are Zhou Wen?” Philo’s eyes widened as she pointed at Zhou Wen and asked in surprise and delight.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m Zhou Wen. Is there a problem?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled as to why Philo had such a huge reaction.</p>
<p>“Which school did you attend in the past?” Philo asked.</p>
<p>“East District’s Sunset College. I’m not sure if you’ve heard of it.” Zhou Wen roughly guessed that Lucas had mentioned him in front of Philo.</p>
<p>“Ah, there’s no mistake then. You are really Zhou Wen. That’s great.” Philo was overjoyed.</p>
<p>“Philo, is he really Lucas’s friend?” the elder asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“It’s not just a friend. He’s the person Lucas admires the most. No, Lucas said that he’s a godlike person,” said Philo solemnly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1255'>Chapter 1255: Greenhouse</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Everyone was stunned when they heard that. Many of them were like the elder who had known Lucas for many years. They also knew him very well.</p>
<p>Lucas was an extremely narcissistic person. In his eyes, he was the only hero who could save the world. Although he wasn’t someone difficult to get along with, it wasn’t easy to hear praises of another person from Lucas.</p>
<p>What Philo said didn’t sound like it came from Lucas.</p>
<p>“Lucas said that he’s a godlike person?” The elder looked at Zhou Wen with an odd expression. He really didn’t believe that the great Lucas would praise others like that.</p>
<p>Philo ignored the elder and said excitedly to Zhou Wen, “You’re here to save Lucas, right? It’s great that you came.”</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>“Er, is the reason for going to the Time Hut that you discovered something?” Zhou Wen was somewhat embarrassed. He realized that he couldn’t be called a competent friend. He actually knew nothing about what had happened to Lucas.</p>
<p>Philo shook her head and said, “Lucas said that he’s the greatest hero, so he had to contract the strongest Guardian. And the most terrifying dimensional zone on the Peninsula of Gods is the Time Hut. He heard from somewhere that there’s a Guardian in there, so he decided to head there to contract it.”</p>
<p>“He never returned. In the past few years, I’ve tried my best to organize people to go to the Time Hut to find him, but my abilities are limited after all. There aren’t many people I can find. I went a few times, but nothing came of it. I had to find stronger people. But how many people do I know? I just thought that after so many years, Lucas’s chances of survival weren’t high. I couldn’t find any powerful experts to save him, so I thought I might as well go in myself. It’s best if I can see him. If I can’t, I’ll just pass on with him.”</p>
<p>After Philo roughly explained the situation, Zhou Wen realized that she had already made up her mind to die. If the elder hadn’t brought her back, she would probably have died in the Time Hut.</p>
<p>“Great, even Lucas said that you are a godlike person. You can definitely save him, right?” Philo looked at Zhou Wen with anticipation.</p>
<p>“I’ll do my best to rescue Lucas,” Zhou Wen said, but he knew that Lucas was probably dead.</p>
<p>Four years was just too long. If Lucas had really encountered danger in the Time Hut, he would have died long ago.</p>
<p>Philo naturally understood this as well, but she still held onto a glimmer of hope. She had relied on this hope to survive for the past few years.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. Let’s not waste any more time,” Zhou Wen said as he prepared to continue.</p>
<p>“Philo, let’s make the trip together,” the elder said after some hesitation.</p>
<p>Although Lucas said that Zhou Wen was his friend, who could guarantee that this young man was really the Zhou Wen that Lucas had mentioned? After all, Zhou Wen looked too young. No matter how one looked at it, he didn’t seem like the mighty godlike person Lucas had mentioned.</p>
<p>Although he wasn’t willing to risk the lives of his own people, he also didn’t wish to see Philo deceived.</p>
<p>“You wish to go now?” Philo looked at the elder in surprise.</p>
<p>“We’ll take you to the Piranha Flower King. If you can’t pass, we can bring you back. If you can pass, there’s still a distance to the Time Hut, so it will be faster if someone leads the way,” the elder said.</p>
<p>Philo nodded and didn’t refuse the offer.</p>
<p>The group set off again. The elder led the way and soon arrived at the place they had mentioned.</p>
<p>It was a canyon between two mountains. The originally wide canyon was now blocked by a flower.</p>
<p>The petals of the flower seemed to be carved from ice. They were crystalline and shimmering under the sunlight.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder the elder calls it a Piranha Flower King. This flower is indeed huge. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that it’s the king of flowers. Zhou Wen sized up the flower and asked the elder beside him, “How does this Piranha Flower eat humans?”</p>
<p>The elder said, “In the past, there was nothing in this canyon. This huge flower suddenly appeared recently. I sent someone to use a Companion Beast to scout the way. I originally wanted to see if the Piranha Flower King would injure anyone, but I never expected…”</p>
<p>The elder recounted what had happened. They couldn’t help but feel sad.</p>
<p>“You didn’t see how those people vanished?” Ice Maiden suddenly asked after the elder finished speaking.</p>
<p>“No. After the Companion Beast awoke the Piranha Flower King, the companions closest to it disappeared one after another. We had no choice but to retreat with Philo,” the elder said.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden continued asking, “When they disappear, which disappears first—their heads or bodies?”</p>
<p>“Is there a difference?” the young man asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Of course there’s a difference.” Ice Maiden had no intention of explaining. She continued looking at the elder.</p>
<p>The elder thought for a moment and looked at his companions beside him. He said with uncertainty, “I vaguely remember the heads disappearing first. However, I only saw one of my companions being devoured. I didn’t see the others.”</p>
<p>“It was the head first; no mistake about it. I saw it too. Their heads vanished, but their bodies seemed to be pulled into the air by something. Soon, even their bodies vanished,” a middle-aged man said.</p>
<p>Those who saw it said that the head was the first to disappear.</p>
<p>After Ice Maiden heard that, she revealed a thoughtful expression.</p>
<p>“Do you know the origins of this flower?” Zhou Wen asked Ice Maiden.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden nodded slightly. “If I’m not wrong, this flower isn’t the Piranha Flower King, but the greenhouse of the Flower race.”</p>
<p>“Greenhouse?” Zhou Wen looked at the flower. No matter how he looked at it, it was a living flower and not a building that had been built into the shape of a flower.</p>
<p>“A greenhouse is a place for the Flower race to reside. It’s similar to my ice castle. The true Flower race member is inside the flower. However, the Flower race seldom interacts with the outside world. I haven’t seen many members of the Flower race, but I’m basically certain that this is from the Flower race.” Ice Maiden paused before saying, “It’s clearly a problem for the Flower race to suddenly arrive on Earth at this time. Perhaps it has something to do with the Venusian dimensional zone.”</p>
<p>“If that’s really the Flower race, he should be able to see us, right?” Zhou Wen asked the flower.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“It’s definitely possible under normal circumstances. However, typically speaking, the Flower race shouldn’t appear in such a place. After this Flower race came to Earth, they clearly encountered some problems. Perhaps they were injured,” Ice Maiden said after some thought.</p>
<p>“It’s good that they’re injured.” Zhou Wen looked at the huge greenhouse and was already considering how to capture the Flower race member inside.</p>
<p>“You mean that the flower isn’t a creature from Earth but a creature from the dimension?” The elder finally understood after listening for a while. His expression changed drastically.</p>
<p>Although Human Sovereign’s slaying of Di Tian had proven humanity’s strength, creatures from the dimension were still godlike existences to ordinary people.</p>

<p>In the minds of ordinary people, creatures from the dimension were still lifeforms that humans couldn’t touch. After all, there was only one Human Sovereign, and most people were ordinary.</p>
<p>“Is there a way to cross it?” Philo looked at Zhou Wen, feeling uneasy, afraid that he would shake his head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen remained composed as he looked at Ice Maiden and asked, “What do you think?”</p>
<p>Ice Maiden answered, “Even if the Flower race descends into the human world, it’s impossible for them to be Flower King-grade experts. Furthermore, they will be greatly suppressed by the rules of Earth. They shouldn’t be too much of a threat.”</p>
<p>Everyone wore odd expressions when they heard Ice Maiden’s relaxed tone. This was because Ice Maiden’s tone was just too arrogant. It was like an ordinary person eating a bowl of noodles at a streetside noodle shop when suddenly, they heard someone eating peanuts and noodles at the table discussing if they should buy a few aircraft carriers for fun this year.</p>
<p>Beside them, Grim Demon also said, “It’s just a mere Flower race.. If it dares block the way, just kill it. Why waste your breath?”</p>
<p>“In that case, let’s go,” Zhou Wen said as he carried Ya’er and Demonic Neonate towards the greenhouse.</p>
<p>Philo gritted her teeth and followed. The others were somewhat hesitant and didn’t dare follow them.</p>
<p>The elder coughed dryly. “Philo, be careful. Don’t force yourself.”</p>
<p>“Without Lucas around, there’s no happiness in this world. At most, I’ll die. It’s nothing,” said Philo as she strode forward and followed closely behind Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Lucas had said that Zhou Wen was the most trustworthy person he had ever met. Lucas trusted Zhou Wen, and Philo was willing to believe him. Furthermore, she had no other choice.</p>
<p>Apart from Zhou Wen, no one else would dare take her to the Time Hut.</p>
<p>The elder and his employees watched from afar. No one dared to follow them. It wasn’t because they were cowardly. They had their own families and many of them were the financial backbone of their families. They didn’t dare risk their lives.</p>
<p>When they approached the valley, the petals swayed in the breeze, looking beautiful.</p>
<p>The average person would find it beautiful, but Zhou Wen, Ice Maiden, and Grim Demon saw crystalline stamens extend out of the greenhouse and attack them.</p>
<p>The stamens were like snakes. Their bodies were slender, but their heads could be split into four petals, like the mouths of monsters.</p>
<p>Without waiting for Zhou Wen to take action, Grim Demon, who was already itching from boredom, charged forward. Demonic aura condensed into a saber that instantly sliced through the flower stamen that extended out.</p>
<p>The flower stamens that had been severed lost their strength and immediately appeared, falling to the ground.</p>
<p>“He’s at the Terror grade!” The young man looked at Grim Demon in horror.</p>
<p>Grim Demon had been following Zhou Wen like a lackey, so he never expected such terrifying strength from him.</p>
<p>The elder looked at Grim Demon in thought as though he had thought of something. However, he couldn’t be sure. He asked a red-nosed man beside him, “Big Nose, do you find that fellow familiar?”</p>
<p>“Now that you mention it, it does seem so, but I can’t remember where I’ve seen him before,” the big-nosed man said after some thought.</p>
<p>“You think so too. Doesn’t he look like the Guardian who appeared invincible in the Cube battle five years ago?” the elder said again.</p>
<p>“Five years ago… Guardian… Ah…” The big-nosed man exclaimed as though he had figured it out. “That’s right, that’s right. It’s very similar. That Guardian’s name is Grim Demon, right? He seems to be with Human Sovereign… That’s right, that’s right. It’s him…”</p>
<p>The elder nodded. “If you think so too, then we can’t be wrong. I never expected to see him here. Five years ago, he was already a top Guardian. He’s probably stronger five years later. It’s no wonder he’s not afraid of creatures from the dimension.”</p>
<p>“It’s said that Grim Demon is Human Sovereign’s servant. If he’s following Zhou Wen now, could Zhou Wen be…” The big-nosed man widened his eyes in disbelief as he looked at Zhou Wen who was walking towards the greenhouse.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“It can’t be possible. How old is he? He was probably in his teens five years ago. It’s unlikely he’s Human Sovereign.” The elder’s son understood what the big-nosed man was getting at, but found it unlikely.</p>
<p>“That’s right. If he were a little older, he might really be Human Sovereign. However, even if he isn’t Human Sovereign, he definitely has a great background to be treated like this by a Guardian like Grim Demon. Perhaps the elders in his family are related to Human Sovereign,” the elder said.</p>
<p>The big-nosed man and company shared the same thoughts. It was no wonder they had such guesses. The Zhou Wen from five years ago was just too young. No one believed that a teenage boy could reach such a level and kill Di Tian who was like the lord of a universe.</p>
<p>Grim Demon unleashed his might as his demonic aura transformed into a hundred-meter-long saber. He slashed at the greenhouse in the valley, hoping to split it open and carve out a path to the heavens.</p>
<p>As though sensing Grim Demon’s terror, the greenhouse in the valley shook violently. Flower stamens that resembled light snakes extended out and swept towards the demonic aura saber.</p>
<p>However, under Grim Demon’s overwhelming demonic aura, the stamens were sliced apart. The dense flower stamens failed to block the demonic aura saber and were diced up.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The demonic aura saber slashed at the petal, leaving a huge crack.</p>
<p>Just as the saber was about to strike the bottom of the petal, it was finally blocked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen focused his gaze and saw a flower fairy-like girl sitting cross-legged in the stamen. Her eyes were like petals that emitted a silver glow. Her muslin clothes were translucent like some heavenly robe.</p>
<p>A pair of jade-like hands blocked Grim Demon’s demonic aura saber. Even someone as powerful as Grim Demon couldn’t complete the slash.</p>
<p>The girl held the demonic aura saber with both hands and slowly stood up. Her jade-like legs were long and straight. As she moved, the greenhouse converged and transformed into a flower dress that gathered over the girl’s body, making her look even more beautiful and noble.</p>
<p>Grim Demon’s eyes flashed with killing intent as the demonic aura on his body constantly surged into the demonic saber, increasing its might. However, it failed to slash down.</p>
<p>“Do you know her?” Zhou Wen asked Ice Maiden.</p>
<p>“I don’t know her but I’m certain she’s from the Flower race,” Ice Maiden said.</p>
<p>“That’s enough.” Zhou Wen condensed Sword Pill and shot it at the Flower race woman.</p>
<p>The Flower race woman was fighting Grim Demon with all her might, so she didn’t have the strength to deal with Sword Pill. Sword Pill penetrated her chest and slammed her into the mountain wall behind her.</p>
<p>Philo and company couldn’t see the Terror-grade battle. All they saw was Grim Demon rushing towards the greenhouse before it vanished.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen waved his hand, the mountain wall collapsed. The beautiful woman’s chest was penetrated by a crystalline sword as she was nailed to the mountain wall.</p>
<p>“He’s indeed a Terror-grade existence. He’s still so young.” The elder sighed.</p>
<p>Philo was overjoyed as she thought to herself, Lucas really didn’t lie to me. Zhou Wen is just so powerful. Perhaps he can really save Lucas.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1257'>Chapter 1257: Trouble</h3>

<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Transparent blood constantly flowed out of the flower girl’s chest, but her clothes were gradually withering. She couldn’t even open her eyes. She looked like she was about to die.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to walk over and see if he could pick up anything from her.</p>
<p>After all, she was from a dimension. She might have some treasures on her.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden followed Zhou Wen. Just as Zhou Wen was about to plunder the items, Ice Maiden saw something on the flower girl’s neck. Her pupils suddenly constricted as she hurriedly said to Zhou Wen, “We can’t let her die. Quickly save her.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Do you know her?” Zhou Wen looked at Ice Maiden in puzzlement.. He had previously asked her, but she had clearly said that she didn’t know her.</p>
<p>“No, there’s no time to explain. Save her first. Don’t let her die. I’ll explain it to you later.” Ice Maiden looked very anxious.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen seldom saw Ice Maiden with such an expression. Furthermore, the flower girl was indeed on the brink of death. If he didn’t save her now, it would be too late. There was no time for questions.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen pulled out his Sword Pill from her body and used the power of Human Sovereign. At the instant the flower girl dropped down, his fist mercilessly struck her chest, leaving a hole in the wound that was the result of the sword’s penetration.</p>
<p>Philo looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement. She had clearly heard Ice Maiden asking Zhou Wen to save her, but Zhou Wen had ruthlessly attacked.</p>
<p>The others looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement. Zhou Wen punched through the flower girl’s chest and slammed her body into the mountain wall, producing cracks in the wall.</p>
<p>However, the next scene made Philo and company widen their eyes. The flower girl’s chest wound, which had been punched through by Zhou Wen, healed at a discernible pace. In a moment, she was as good as new.</p>
<p>Just as the flower girl recovered, Ice Maiden struck out with the power of ice, freezing the flower girl and sealing her in ice.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Ice Maiden, unsure of her intentions—she wanted her saved, yet she sealed her up.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden used a strange ability to transmit her voice into Zhou Wen’s ears. No one else could hear her.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid we’ve gotten into big trouble.” Ice Maiden didn’t wait for Zhou Wen to ask further as she continued, “This flower girl has the Tear of the Flower Goddess on her. She definitely has an extremely intimate relationship with the Flower Goddess. If we kill her, the Flower Goddess will be furious. If that happens, we will probably have to face unimaginable horror. However, we can’t release her. We nearly killed her, so she will bear a grudge. Releasing her will only make things worse for us.”</p>
<p>“Flower Goddess?” Zhou Wen didn’t know what kind of existence Flower Goddess was, but from Ice Maiden’s expression, she seemed to have an extremely high status in the dimension.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden explained in a voice that only Zhou Wen could hear, “Among the dimension’s Apocalypse experts, the Flower Goddess can be ranked in the top five. Furthermore, there are many experts in the Flower race. If they risk everything to forcefully descend, it will be a calamity that will wipe out all life.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used his spatial powers to send his voice into Ice Maiden’s ear. “Will the Flower Goddess risk everything for a clansman who has entered Earth? That will probably cost a lot, right?”</p>
<p>According to what Zhou Wen knew, the clansmen sent to Earth in recent years were only cannon fodder. Most of them were Guardians and not pure dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden said with a bitter smile, “That’s what makes it bad. This flower girl isn’t an ordinary member of the Flower race. The Tear of the Flower Goddess is extremely rare among them. Only a few very special members have been bestowed the Tear of the Flower Goddess. If the life of a Flower race member with the Tear of the Flower Goddess is threatened, the Flower Goddess will be able to sense it. This is the final defense mechanism to protect them. As this is Earth, it’s too isolated from the dimension, so the Flower Goddess might not have sensed her injuries. However, once she dies, the Flower Goddess will definitely sense it. When that happens, it will be troublesome.”</p>
<p>“Even if she can sense it, she won’t know who killed her, right?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“If only it were that simple. That Tear of the Flower Goddess isn’t simple. Although I’ve only heard of it and don’t know its exact use, it’s definitely possible for her to discover that we killed her. At the very least, in the dimension, no one dares to kill Flower ladies who possess the Tear of the Flower Goddess.” Ice Maiden showed an abnormal look of disgust.</p>
<p>She never expected that a random Flower race member on Earth would have the Tear of the Flower Goddess.</p>
<p>Did the Flower race member with the Tear of the Flower Goddess have nothing better to do. Why did she come to Earth? There were billions of Flower race members and plenty of cannon fodder. She never expected such a fellow to come.</p>
<p>“Then what should we do?” Zhou Wen didn’t like trouble, and this clearly spelled huge trouble.</p>
<p>“How would I know? We definitely can’t kill her, but it’s not good to let her go.” After a pause, Ice Maiden continued, “How about this? Let’s bring her along and see if we can think of a way to change her mind and rope her in.”</p>
<p>“What kind of people possess the Tear of the Flower Goddess? This one doesn’t look that strong,” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.</p>
<p>“The future Flower Goddess, or a descendant that the Flower Goddess values, or even the Flower Goddess’s very own daughter. These are all possible. I’ve only heard of them, but I’ve never seen them before. How would I know which one it is?” Ice Maiden felt disgusted at the situation she was in as though she had eaten a fly.</p>
<p>“Then let’s bring her along.” Zhou Wen waved his hand and stored the frozen flower girl in the Chaos Bead.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t too worried. If the dimension could conquer Earth so easily, they would have long taken Earth for themselves. They wouldn’t have waited until today and caused so much trouble.</p>
<p>No matter how strong the Flower Goddess was, it obviously wasn’t easy for her to descend to Earth.</p>
<p>However, he could keep this flower girl alive. He might be able to obtain more information regarding the dimension from such an important figure.</p>
<p>“Let’s go to the Time Hut,” Zhou Wen said as he continued walking.</p>
<p>The ability to kill and save people at the wave of his hand was truly shocking. The elder ran over with the others and continued leading the way for Zhou Wen and company. He didn’t dare be negligent, and his words and actions were much more restrained.</p>
<p>Even Philo didn’t dare be as casual as before when she spoke to Zhou Wen again.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden didn’t say a word along the way. She was having a headache over how to deal with the flower girl. It didn’t seem easy for her to not bear a grudge after beating her up to a pulp.</p>
<p>Nothing major happened along the way. Some minor problems could be resolved with the guide and his subordinates. They were very familiar with the area.</p>
<p>After traveling for two to three hours, Zhou Wen finally saw the legendary Time Hut.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1258'>Chapter 1258: Sweetie’s Wooden Hut</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>The Time Hut really lives up to its name! Zhou Wen looked at the Time Hut and finally knew why it was given that name.</p>
<p>On a tree in the forest, there was an inconspicuous treehouse. It was made from wood from the forest.</p>
<p>On the treehouse, there were plants similar to ivy, making the entire wooden hut exude vibrancy.</p>
<p>If not for Philo and company being very certain that this was the Time Hut, Zhou Wen would have imagined that this was a temporary residence built by hunters. It was a little too small. From the outside, it looked as if it could only accommodate two to three adults.</p>
<p>The door of the hut was nailed with wooden planks and looked like it had quite a number of cracks. There was a plaque with tree bark covering parts of it hanging on the door. It was irregularly shaped, and one could see the holes left by worms and the tree rings.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>And on the plaque, there was a line of words: “Sweetie’s Wooden Hut.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously seen these words on the Internet. Many people were guessing the meaning behind the word “Sweetie”, but no matter how many western myths they ran through, they couldn’t figure out who or what Sweetie was.</p>
<p>Someone guessed that Sweetie was the name of a creature, and the Time Hut belonged to it.</p>
<p>Some people guessed that to mythical creatures, the Time Hut was like candy.</p>
<p>There were also people who guessed that there was some kind of candy hidden in the wooden hut. One could immediately advance to the Mythical stage after eating it. There were all sorts of guesses, but no one knew the reason for its name.</p>
<p>People were more used to calling it Time Hut. After all, the name ‘Sweetie’s Wooden Hut’ wasn’t suitable for such a terrifying place. It was also quite a mouthful.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sized up the wooden hut and wasn’t in a rush to enter. It was useless to be anxious. Lucas had been missing for four years. If he was in danger of dying, he would have died long ago. If he remained alive, the additional few minutes wouldn’t matter.</p>
<p>He circled the wooden hut, hoping to find the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>To enter a place like the Time Hut in real life was equivalent to risking one’s life to try one’s luck. If one was unlucky, even a Terror-grade entity might not be able to exit.</p>
<p>Even a temporal expert like Cave Era had to buy spatial skill crystals from others instead of farming them inside the Time Hut. It could be imagined how terrifying this place was.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen was delighted. He discovered the tiny palm symbol on the wooden plank near the roof of the Time Hut.</p>
<p>It was engraved on the bark of the wooden board. Under the elements, it had become blurry, like a child’s scribble.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took out his phone and took a picture of the tiny palm symbol that held a wooden hut. His phone immediately entered the download screen. He then pretended to take a few pictures elsewhere.</p>
<p>“Are we going in now?” Philo asked Zhou Wen. She knew that she wasn’t capable enough, but she still planned on entering. If she couldn’t find Lucas, she hoped to quickly spend the rest of her remaining life in the Time Hut.</p>
<p>“Not for now. We need to make some preparations.” Zhou Wen planned on waiting for the Time Hut dungeon to be downloaded before entering the game to take a look.</p>
<p>To randomly enter such a dangerous place would be at odds with the original intention of saving Lucas—not only would he not be saved, but many lives would be lost as well.</p>
<p>Although Philo wanted to enter immediately, she knew that without Zhou Wen, the chances of her rescuing Lucas were slim. All she could do was wait patiently.</p>
<p>“Thank you for bringing us here. If you have things to do, you can head back now,” Zhou Wen said to the elder.</p>
<p>The elder hurriedly said, “There’s no rush. The strange forest is unpredictable. The path we came from will be somewhat different when we return. Only people who are very familiar with it can rely on experience to find a way out. We’ll wait for you and Philo to rescue Lucas before taking you out.”</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, he suddenly frowned slightly and looked deeper into the strange forest.</p>
<p>After watching for a while, Zhou Wen turned his head and asked the elder, “Is there an animal-type dimensional creature in the strange forest?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. They are basically plant-type dimensional creatures. We have never seen animal-type dimensional creatures before. Only the Time Hut has some animal-shaped dimensional creatures, but they aren’t real animals. They are puppets that look like animals,” the elder said.</p>
<p>“That’s strange.” Zhou Wen looked deep into the strange forest as his expression turned solemn.</p>
<p>With his hearing, he could only hear a faint panting sound. Furthermore, it gave off an extremely dangerous feeling that made Zhou Wen’s heart palpitate.</p>
<p>“The strange forest isn’t safe. It’s best you return,” Zhou Wen said to the elder.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t know where the thing was, Zhou Wen was certain that there was definitely some terrifying creature in this strange forest.</p>
<p>The creature’s non-appearance didn’t mean that it wouldn’t appear.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that the creature was eyeing them. This was just a feeling—he couldn’t determine where it was.</p>
<p>“You can rest assured about that. My father has been traversing the strange forest for decades, but he has never encountered any animal-type creatures. Instead, there are some plant-type dimensional creatures that can move. The most common ones are the Devil Treants. Their roots can move in the soil and rocks.” As the elder’s son spoke, he summoned a Devil Treant Companion Beast. It looked like a strange tree with eyes and a trunk as thick as a water vat.</p>
<p>“It’s not a Devil Treant. It should be some kind of animal.” Zhou Wen shook his head slightly. He was certain that the panting was bestial.</p>
<p>Most of these people had been in the strange forest for more than ten years. They had never seen any animal-type dimensional creatures, so they naturally didn’t believe Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, they didn’t dare refute Zhou Wen’s words. It still left them extremely uneasy, believing that Zhou Wen didn’t have any use for them.</p>
<p>The elder smiled and said, “Then we’ll head back.”</p>
<p>“It’s probably too late now.” Zhou Wen stared deep into the forest as his expression turned solemn. He could already sense that the panting was approaching.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t discover any traces of the creature. With his senses, he could only hear panting sounds approaching, but he couldn’t discover its location. This made him extremely wary.</p>
<p>The elder and company were somewhat puzzled, unsure what Zhou Wen meant.</p>
<p>Grim Demon and Ice Maiden also sensed something as they looked around—they also heard panting. Like Zhou Wen, they couldn’t tell where the panting was coming from.</p>
<p>Ya’er leaned into Zhou Wen’s embrace as though she was afraid.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate showed no fear. Her large eyes stared deep into the forest as though she was looking at something.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The ground trembled as a large portion of the trees in the distance snapped. The rows of trees collapsed like dominoes as they crashed down.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1259'>Chapter 1259: A Non-Existent Opponent</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>As large swaths of trees fell, a clearing appeared in the forest. Philo and company also heard the oppressive panting, but they couldn’t see anything.</p>
<p>“Terror creature?” The elder’s expression changed slightly.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen, Ice Maiden, and company knew that things weren’t that simple. If the other party was an ordinary Terror-grade creature, they would have long seen him. However, up to now, they couldn’t see anything either. Only the panting constantly echoed in their ears, as though there were wild beasts that had red eyes from killing.</p>
<p>Grim Demon emitted a terrifying demonic aura that surged towards the clearing in the forest like a tidal wave. Presumably, he didn’t see where the other party was and wanted to use this method to force him out.</p>
<p>However, after the surging demonic aura swept over, all the trees and vegetation were leveled, but they still didn’t discover traces of the other party. Only the extremely oppressive breathing could be heard from time to time, almost driving one crazy..</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had long activated Great Brahma and had been observing his surroundings, but he didn’t discover anything.</p>
<p>Grim Demon had rather rich combat experience. After his first probe failed, he immediately launched a second attack. However, this time, he didn’t use a large area-of-attack demonic aura. Instead, he roared at the sky and emitted a demonic sound that was filled with killing intent.</p>
<p>The demonic sound spread in all directions. When the elder, Philo, and company heard the demonic sound, they immediately covered their ears and fell to the ground. Soon, they began bleeding from their seven orifices as they rolled around in pain and let out tragic cries.</p>
<p>If this continued, their companions would die before they found the opponent. Zhou Wen had to get Grim Demon to stop the demonic aural attack.</p>
<p>Grim Demon had no choice but to stop. He frowned and said, “It’s not an invisibility ability. If it’s an invisibility ability, my demonic voice should have feedback when it touches it.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw Philo and company crawl to their feet. Although they were in a sorry state, there wasn’t much of a problem. He knew that Grim Demon had deliberately controlled the lethality of the demonic sound. Otherwise, ordinary people like them would have died.</p>
<p>“It’s not an invisibility ability, but we can’t see it. What kind of ability is this?” Zhou Wen wasn’t asking Grim Demon, but thinking aloud to himself.</p>
<p>When Ice Maiden heard that, she said, “According to what I know, there are several possibilities. Creatures like Phantoms, Nightmares, and Ghosts can achieve such an effect. However, these creatures aren’t very aggressive and focus more on psyche attacks. The strike that destroyed the forest was an undiscounted strength-type attack. I can’t think of any creature that has both of these abilities.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t expect it to be an ability, but he had his own way. He summoned his army of Musical Note Sprites as tens of thousands of them flew in all directions, covering all the nearby areas.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of creature it was, if it wanted to come over, it had to pass through the Musical Note Sprites. When the time came, it would naturally be exposed.</p>
<p>Seeing countless Musical Note Sprites cover a large area, Philo and the others felt a lot more at ease. At least in such a situation, they felt that it was safe in the Musical Note Sprites’ coverage.</p>
<p>Even if there was danger, it was the Musical Note Sprites that would be killed first.</p>
<p>However, they had clearly underestimated how terrifying the creature was. The Musical Note Sprites that produced the music weren’t touched, but a member of the team suddenly vanished.</p>
<p>The person had stood not far from the elder. In an instant, he had vanished as though he had learned instant transmission.</p>
<p>However, the terrifying panting that sounded in the elder’s ear made him realize that it wasn’t that the person had learned instant transmission, but that the terrifying creature had taken him away.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, Ice Maiden, and Grim Demon had ugly expressions. He had vanished not far from them, but they hadn’t discovered the opponent.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suspected that the other party was a tiny dimensional creature, but despite using Great Brahma’s Minute Subtlety observation ability, he didn’t discover any special microorganisms nearby.</p>
<p>“We have to leave this place immediately and split up,” Ice Maiden suggested.</p>
<p>They didn’t even know where the enemy was, so there was no way to fight this battle. They could only passively take a beating. If they stayed behind, only death awaited them.</p>
<p>“What’s the rush? If a few more people die, we will definitely be able to capture it,” Grim Demon said coldly. Such an opponent infuriated him.</p>
<p>The dead people he was referring to were naturally the guides. It wasn’t just Grim Demon. Zhou Wen and Ice Maiden could also tell that the creature didn’t prioritize its attack on them. Instead, it targeted the weaker guides. It was also apprehensive and likely wouldn’t attack them first.</p>
<p>Grim Demon naturally didn’t care about the lives of the guides.</p>
<p>If one was slow-witted, they definitely wouldn’t be able to survive for long while being a guide to the strange forest. The guides were all smart people, so how could they not know that staying behind would only lead to death? Without any hesitation, they ran back the way they came, hoping to escape.</p>
<p>Grim Demon wanted to stop them from escaping, but Zhou Wen stopped him.</p>
<p>“Come back.” Zhou Wen got Demonic Neonate to summon Grim Demon back. At the same time, he got Ice Maiden and Jade Rabbit to return to the Chaos Bead. Ya’er was also sent into the Chaos Bead.</p>
<p>Philo gritted her teeth and rushed towards the Time Hut.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out and grabbed at the air, pulling Philo back and throwing her into the Chaos Bead.</p>
<p>Only Zhou Wen and Demonic Neonate remained. The reason Zhou Wen did so was because he realized that Demonic Neonate seemed to be able to see the creature.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate’s eyes kept turning. No panting could be heard after she looked at a spot.</p>
<p>“Can you see where that thing is?” Zhou Wen asked Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate nodded slightly before shaking her head. “I can only sense its location. I can’t see it.”</p>
<p>“Left,” Demonic Neonate suddenly said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood and instant transmitted to the right.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A huge hoof mark appeared where Zhou Wen had been. The deep pit that it created was the size of a room.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the Golden Battle God Spear in his hand and struck the hoofprint, but he failed to hit anything. He failed to sense the other party’s location.</p>
<p>“Behind,” Demonic Neonate said again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen instant transmitted again. The spot he had been standing on was attacked again. It was as though something like a saber had slashed across the sky. The nearby trees were sliced apart like grass.</p>
<p>What the hell is this? Zhou Wen’s expression turned nasty. In such an intense battle, he was still unable to sense the other party’s existence.</p>
<p>However, the other party was clearly a creature with immense strength. It wasn’t a spirit body with weak offensive strength.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Demonic Neonate could sense the other party’s location and acted as Zhou Wen’s eyes. A special battle unfolded in the strange forest.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1260'>Chapter 1260: Spacetime Bandit</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen held the two golden guns in hand as he constantly shot at the spot Demonic Neonate indicated, but none of the bullets hit the target.</p>
<p>Not only was his opponent invisible, but he also didn’t seem to have a corporeal body. As he constantly attacked, Zhou Wen felt as though he was fighting the air.</p>
<p>However, the other party’s attack had a powerful destructive force. If Demonic Neonate hadn’t helped Zhou Wen determine the location of the adversary, he probably would have suffered countless heavy blows.</p>
<p>Since the golden guns of three different attributes were useless, Zhou Wen put away the golden guns and summoned the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords and Asura Saber to continue fighting the air.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally hoped that the Son of Heaven’s Sword would be able to play a special role, but he regretfully realized that it couldn’t injure his opponent.</p>
<p>As the battle continued, Zhou Wen suddenly felt his hand sink. The Asura Saber’s blade seemed to slice through something. Then, Zhou Wen realized that red blood had appeared on the blade..</p>
<p>It hit? Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>However, when he focused his gaze, he didn’t find any traces of his opponent. The blood on the blade quickly vanished as though it had never existed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately began to think about why the Asura Saber had suddenly struck the target. It had previously slashed at least a thousand times, but not once had it hit. Why had it worked that one time?</p>
<p>Coincidence? Clearly not.</p>
<p>Could it be the Luck and Fortune stat of Deva Asura? The first thing Zhou Wen thought of was naturally Deva Asura’s most special ability.</p>
<p>However, after careful thought, he felt that it might not be that simple. Luck would only produce a certain chance of injuring the opponent.</p>
<p>As for this opponent’s body, it was as though it didn’t exist. He couldn’t even slash at it, so there was naturally no question about hitting it.</p>
<p>It’s not the effect of the Luck stat. Could it be the Deva’s Five Signs of Decay? Zhou Wen immediately thought of another possibility.</p>
<p>Deva Asura had the ability of the Greater and Lesser Deva’s Five Signs of Decay. Although Zhou Wen had never discovered any use for these two abilities when it was in the Asura Saber state, Zhou Wen felt that it was very likely that these two abilities had played a role, causing him to injure the nonexistent enemy.</p>
<p>After a while, Zhou Wen struck again. This time, it took even less time than before.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was increasingly certain that the Deva’s Five Signs of Decay had some effect. Otherwise, if he were to rely on luck, the chances would be about the same without much deviation.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen clearly felt that it was becoming easier and easier for him to slash his opponent. It was highly likely that the Deva’s Five Signs of Decay had taken effect on him.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen slashed more times, although he still couldn’t see the strange creature, he could sense that it was becoming weaker and weaker.</p>
<p>Finally, when Zhou Wen slashed down again, there was a tragic cry as a creature collapsed in a pool of blood on the ground. Half its head had been chopped off.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully sized it up and realized that the creature wasn’t as big as he imagined. It was only about two meters tall. Its lower body was that of a horse, while its upper body was that of a human. Its arms were blades, and its entire body was metal. And inside his body, there were many mechanical gears and components. It looked strange and mysterious, giving off the feeling of a mechanical creature.</p>
<p>He brandished his saber and slashed at the creature’s corpse. The metal body couldn’t withstand the sharpness of the Asura Saber. All sorts of mechanical parts dropped and Zhou Wen quickly discovered a dimensional crystal.</p>
<p>It was a strange metal crystal. Its shape was like a metal pocket watch with a spinning minute hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used his phone to snap a picture and immediately saw its information.</p>
<p>Spacetime Bandit Dimensional Crystal: Terror</p>
<p>Requirements: Temporal Terror transformation, Spatial Terror transformation, Constitution 81, Essence Energy 81, Strength 81, Speed 81</p>
<p>So this fellow is called Spacetime Bandit. It’s at the Terror-grade of the dual-elemental powers of time and space. I wonder what kind of skill this skill crystal will be. Could it be an ability that makes it impossible to be sensed or seen? Unfortunately, I don’t have a Temporal Terror transformation… Wait… I might… If I can use the Demon God Body and the Godfiend Era at the same time, I can use the Demon God Body to become a temporal creature. Together with the spatial powers of the Demon God Era, can I meet the requirements? Zhou Wen looked at the corpse of the Spacetime Bandit on the ground.</p>
<p>The Demon God Body could only simulate living creatures. There was no way to simulate the dead.</p>
<p>I’ll definitely encounter a temporal creature when I enter the Time Hut later. I’ll give it a try when the time comes. Without sensing any other danger, Zhou Wen released Ice Maiden and company.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t let Philo out to prevent her from rashly entering the Time Hut to find Lucas.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also wanted to save Lucas, but if he entered without confidence, not only would he be in danger, but he would also waste more time.</p>
<p>It was Zhou Wen’s style to think before acting. He believed that it wasn’t because he was afraid of death.</p>
<p>“Do you know what this is?” Zhou Wen pointed at the Spacetime Bandit on the ground and asked Ice Maiden and Grim Demon.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I’ve never seen such a creature before, nor have I heard of one.” Ice Maiden and Grim Demon said that they had never seen it before. They had never even heard of the Spacetime Bandit.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that the Spacetime Bandit was very special. Furthermore, his corpse didn’t vanish like a typical creature. It was as though his body had already undergone Terror transformation and all the parts were Terror items.</p>
<p>This was very similar to the Ice Dragon King. It was rare among Terror creatures, making it rather special.</p>
<p>He summoned all the Companion Beasts he thought highly of and let them see if anyone was interested in these Terror items.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate clearly wasn’t interested in the pile of metal components and fragments, and among the evolvable Companion Beasts, Truth Listener and Banana Fairy didn’t react either.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s surprise, Explosive Fiend Man became interested in the Terror-transformed metal parts. He walked in front of one of the components and picked it up. He gestured at it as though he wanted to put it on himself.</p>
<p>After gesturing for a long time, he still couldn’t fit it in.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw this, he decided to send the pile of parts and Explosive Fiend Man into the Chaos Bead and let him slowly mess around with them. It might even produce something.</p>
<p>With all this time passing, the Time Hut dungeon had long been downloaded. However, the Time Hut’s name in the game wasn’t Time Hut, but Sweetie’s Wooden Hut.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to care what it was called. After summoning Ice Maiden and Grim Demon back, he immediately activated the dungeon and entered the game.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar entered the wooden hut. The scene he saw was similar to the information he had found online. In the tiny wooden hut, there was a wooden table, wooden chair, wooden bed, and a wooden horse. It looked like a wooden hut for children.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1261'>Chapter 1261: Time Hut</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>At the instant he entered the wooden hut, Zhou Wen felt a strange force descend on him. The blood-colored avatar’s body was rapidly aging.</p>
<p>The time flow in the Time Hut wasn’t fixed. As Zhou Wen entered, he realized that the time flow in the hut was rather fast. His body had aged significantly.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, he rushed towards the wooden door at the back of the wooden hut.</p>
<p>From the outside, the Time Hut was only a wooden hut, but in fact, there were many rooms inside. After passing through the wooden door, there was a corridor behind it. Behind the corridor was a row of four wooden doors. The last door might contain the Spacetime Piglet.</p>
<p>In reality, the Spacetime Piglet would occasionally, but not necessarily, appear.. Zhou Wen had to test if it existed every time in-game.</p>
<p>After rushing through the wooden door, he saw a corridor. However, the flow of time inside was even faster than inside the wooden hut. Zhou Wen switched to the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, but he failed to stop the blood-colored avatar from aging.</p>
<p>Before he reached the last wooden door, the blood-colored avatar had already aged and died.</p>
<p>It doesn’t seem like I can use instant transmission in the Time Hut. It’s not a restriction of the rules, but spatial chaos. I wonder where I’ll be teleported to if I use spatial teleportation. Zhou Wen dripped his blood to revive again and entered the Time Hut dungeon.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Time Hut dungeon didn’t have a 24-hour restriction. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>After entering again, the time flow in the wooden hut slowed down significantly, giving Zhou Wen plenty of time to enter the corridor. The time flow in the corridor wasn’t fast either.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t happy because of this. If he only wanted to farm for the Spacetime Piglet’s skill, he could return now.</p>
<p>However, now that he wanted to save Lucas in reality, the time flow in the Time Hut was so irregular. He could still try his luck in-game. Did he have to try his luck in reality?</p>
<p>If he was unlucky and time flowed too quickly, he would probably die inside.</p>
<p>There were four wooden doors in the corridor. Each wooden door had a wind chime hanging on it. There were words written on each wind chime.</p>
<p>“Past, Present, Future, and Chaos.” Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate when he saw that the words were the same as what was said on the Internet. He pushed open the last wooden door with the word “Chaos.”</p>
<p>The space inside the wooden door was chaotic. Even if the door was open, he couldn’t see what was inside. Even Truth Listener and Great Brahma’s powers couldn’t peek inside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to walk in. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to use his Companion Beasts to explore, but in a place like the Time Hut, every wooden door was equivalent to an independent space. If he sent his Companion Beast in, the Companion Beast would lose contact with him. Therefore, he wouldn’t know what had happened inside, so it wouldn’t be of any use as a scout.</p>
<p>After stepping into the Chaos Hut, a wooden hut appeared in front of Zhou Wen. The wooden table, wooden chair, wooden table, and wooden horse were identical to the previous hut.</p>
<p>In the hut, there was a little piglet carved from wood. It wasn’t big, only the size of a baby piglet. It looked chubby and adorable.</p>
<p>Spacetime Piglet! Before Zhou Wen could rejoice, his body suddenly aged and died. The game screen turned black.</p>
<p>The flow of time in the Chaos Hut is just too fast. Just me taking a few breaths was enough for at least a century or two to pass. If I were to go in real life, I wouldn’t have the chance to escape if I entered a room with an extremely fast flow of time. Zhou Wen’s expression turned heavy.</p>
<p>He knew that he had to think of a way to turn luck into something he could control. Otherwise, entering was equivalent to risking his life akin to buying a lottery ticket.</p>
<p>However, even the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder can’t stop the flow of time. I’m not good at temporal powers. How can I avoid being affected by the flow of time? Zhou Wen couldn’t think of a good solution.</p>
<p>He entered the Time Hut again. This time, his luck wasn’t good. The moment he entered, he felt the blood-colored avatar rapidly age. By the time he pushed open the door and entered the corridor, the blood-colored avatar was already on the brink of death.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned slightly and summoned the Chaos Egg. It was an egg-shaped ball that enveloped the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg was still at the Mythical stage, and it was purely a defensive ability. Even if it could be effective, Zhou Wen couldn’t move while inside the Chaos Egg. It was useless.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen hadn’t originally planned on using it, but after trying all sorts of powers, he realized that it was difficult to stop the flow of time from changing. All he could do was give it a try.</p>
<p>This attempt succeeded. Inside the Chaos Egg, the blood-colored avatar didn’t continue aging. The Chaos Egg managed to completely block the flow of time outside at the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>It’s really possible, but I can’t move after using the Chaos Egg. I can only stay inside. It’s useless even if I’m not affected. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that this was an opportunity.</p>
<p>He planned on trying to advance the First Order of Chaos to the Terror grade. Perhaps when the time came, he would only be able to move while hiding inside the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>This was rather difficult. After being trapped for a hundred years, the First Order of Chaos was the Essence Energy Art that Zhou Wen had spent the shortest time on. Otherwise, it would have reached its Terror transformation by now.</p>
<p>The difficulty of the First Order of Chaos was in no way inferior to the Dao Sutra. Furthermore, there was something about it that left him very displeased. This Essence Energy Art didn’t have any offensive capabilities. The concept of the Essence Energy Art itself determined that it was an extremely passive power.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen wasn’t a very proactive person, he couldn’t stand such extreme passive concepts.</p>
<p>From a portion of the concepts Zhou Wen had comprehended, if he were to compare the First Order of Chaos to a person, he would be the type of person who wouldn’t be angry from being slapped on the left cheek, but would even smile and offer the right.</p>
<p>This concept didn’t suit Zhou Wen’s personality, so even if he wanted to learn it, his comprehension would be very slow. He didn’t even want to cultivate it.</p>
<p>I still have to clear this obstacle in the end. Zhou Wen felt that this wasn’t a bad opportunity. Since he had to master it sooner or later, he might as well take this opportunity to see if he could turn it into a Terror form.</p>
<p>The Time Hut’s flow of time was helpful in gaining insight into the First Order of Chaos.</p>
<p>During the high-speed flow of time, Zhou Wen constantly engraved and gained insights into the First Order of Chaos, but his gains weren’t as great as he imagined. This Essence Energy Art indeed didn’t suit him. If not for the Lost Immortal Sutra’s effects, Zhou Wen probably wouldn’t even have gained basic mastery.</p>
<p>Without any progress, Zhou Wen had no choice but to retreat from the Chaos Egg. After being killed by the Time Hut, he dripped his blood into the game again. He planned on farming for the Spacetime Piglet’s skill first or exploring all four rooms to see if he could use the Demon God Body to transform into a temporal dimensional creature before learning the Spacetime Bandit’s skill crystal.</p>
<p>If it was a temporal skill, he might be able to enter the Time Hut freely without the Chaos Egg advancing to Terror transformation stage.</p>
<p>After trying three or four times, he finally entered the Chaos Hut alive. Indeed, the Spacetime Piglet was there, slumped on the ground.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1262'>Chapter 1262: Past, Future, Present</h3>
<p>The time flow in the Chaos Hut wasn’t too high; it didn’t cause the blood-colored avatar to die immediately at the very least.</p>
<p>As he didn’t know the exact speed of the time flow, Zhou Wen didn’t dare waste any time. He held the golden double guns in his hand and shot at Spacetime Piglet.</p>
<p>Spacetime Piglet immediately reacted as it stared at the blood-colored avatar with widened eyes. Something strange happened. The golden bullets seemed to have a spell cast upon them as they became extremely slow, as though one could pick the golden bullets from midair at any time.</p>
<p>What a powerful spatial skill. Is this the legendary spatial extension? Zhou Wen was somewhat pleasantly surprised. The Spatial Piglet was only at the Mythical stage and already had a certain influence on Terror-grade bullets. This meant that this skill was indeed very powerful.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Mythical stage was ultimately limited. Even though it could slow down the bullets, it still couldn’t see where they were. Soon, it was blasted apart by Zhou Wen’s random shots.</p>
<p>What depressed Zhou Wen was that the Spacetime Piglet only dropped an Essence Energy crystal on his first kill. After that, there was nothing.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he could respawn in the Time Hut dungeon without limitations. If it couldn’t be done once, he just needed to pile on more attempts. The only uncertain matter was how long it would take for the Spacetime Piglet to respawn.</p>
<p>Not wanting to waste the dungeon attempt, Zhou Wen turned around and left the Chaos Hut. He looked at the remaining three huts and hesitated over which one to enter.</p>
<p>Although the mortality rate of the Chaos Hut was very high, there was still a chance of survival. As for the people who entered the other three huts, there were no survivors. Occasionally, someone would come out alive. The descriptions of the other three huts varied, making it difficult to tell the authenticity.</p>
<p>The path to the future ultimately depends on myself. It’s in my hands now. The only thing that can’t be changed is the past. I’ll enter the Past Hut and see what’s inside. After Zhou Wen thought about it, he pushed open the wooden door and walked into the Past Hut.</p>
<p>At the instant he entered the hut, Zhou Wen realized that he had appeared in an area with terrifyingly high-temperature lava. Thankfully, the blood-colored avatar was wearing the Dragon King armor, so the magma at this level didn’t injure him.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, a huge object suddenly appeared in the lava. It opened its mouth and attempted to devour Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly teleported upwards and dodged the behemoth’s devouring attempt.</p>
<p>Standing in midair, Zhou Wen realized that he was surrounded by lava and volcanoes. He didn’t know where he was, but in the lava river below, there was a human with a dragon tail. His head was neither human nor dragon. He had dragon horns on his head, but his face looked like a huge human monster. He held a black flaming fork and stood in the lava, staring at him.</p>
<p>This was the monster that wanted to devour the blood-colored avatar. Seeing Zhou Wen appear in midair, the monster raised the flaming fork in its hand. The entire world immediately turned into a sea of flames as red flames rose up like a tsunami.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used the two golden guns to shoot at the monster. At the same time, he quickly retreated to dodge the monster’s attack.</p>
<p>However, the speed of the flames was even more terrifying than Zhou Wen imagined. It instantly drowned the entire world. Even though the blood-colored avatar used teleportation, the screen went black when it phased out of the teleportation. The game ended with death.</p>
<p>The battle had been too intense. Only then did Zhou Wen see the warning window in-game. It repeatedly indicated Danger! Danger! Danger!</p>
<p>That thing is definitely at the Calamity grade. Furthermore, why does his appearance look a little familiar? I seem to have seen it somewhere. Zhou Wen had definitely never seen such a powerful dimensional creature before, or he wouldn’t have forgotten it.</p>
<p>This sense of familiarity was most likely because he had seen something similar somewhere. Therefore, Zhou Wen carefully recalled and finally remembered where he had seen such a creature.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a creature from reality, but from the information Zhou Wen had garnered from the Fire God Platform.</p>
<p>There was actually more than one fire god in Eastern mythology. There were many different fire gods in different legends. The terrifying creature he had seen was very similar to the Fire God Zhurong who had defeated the Water God Gonggong.</p>
<p>Gonggong had knocked down Mt. Buzhou, causing the world to collapse. It was obvious how terrifying his strength was. Yet, the Fire God, Zhurong, could defeat him. His divine might was even stronger.</p>
<p>The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that the monster he had encountered resembled the mythical Fire God, Zhurong.</p>
<p>This is the West District, and the dungeon is also a West District dungeon. It’s impossible for there to be a mythical figure from the East District here, right? It probably just resembles one. However, there’s actually a Calamity-grade creature in the Time Hut dungeon. This doesn’t make sense. How can there be such a powerful creature? Zhou Wen felt that it was too much.</p>
<p>He had never seen many dungeons with Calamity-grade creatures.</p>
<p>Even the Venusian dungeon was an elite dungeon of a planet. There seemed to be only one Calamity-grade in it. It was odd that there was a Calamity-grade creature in this tiny Time Hut.</p>
<p>Dripping a drop of blood to revive, Zhou Wen entered the Time Hut dungeon again. This time, his luck wasn’t bad—he didn’t die instantly. He rushed into the Chaos Hut, but didn’t see the Spacetime Piglet. From the looks of it, it wouldn’t respawn so quickly. Typical Mythical creatures only respawned once every twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and went to the Future Hut.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already made sufficient preparations, but after entering the Future Hut, he was somewhat dumbfounded. Before he could see anything, his phone screen went black.</p>
<p>How did I die? Zhou Wen frowned inwardly, but he quickly realized that something was amiss. He wasn’t dead. The blood-colored avatar’s senses were still present, but there was absolute darkness around him. He couldn’t see or sense anything. It looked like his phone screen was completely black as though he was dead.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used the power of Human Sovereign to illuminate his surroundings. Just as light suffused his body, his phone screen went black again.</p>
<p>This time, he was really dead. As for Zhou Wen, he had no idea what had happened.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Zhou Wen originally imagined that dying in the Past Hut was depressing enough, but he never expected the Future Hut to be even more unacceptable. He had no idea how he died.</p>
<p>Gritting his teeth, he entered the dungeon again. This time, Zhou Wen’s luck wasn’t that good. He dripped his blood and revived five times before finally arriving in front of the Present Hut.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already seen the Past Hut and the Future Hut. All that was left was the Present Hut. It was a perfect opportunity to enter and see what was inside.</p>
<p>Pushing open the door and walking into the hut, Zhou Wen was already fully prepared to withstand any terrifying attack, but nothing happened.</p>
<p>What he saw was still the wooden hut. The wooden table, wooden chair, wooden bed, and wooden horse were identical to the first time Zhou Wen entered the Time Hut.</p>
<p>There was no Spacetime Piglet here, no terrifying creature from the Past Hut, nor was there the strange darkness of the Future Hut. Even the flow of time was normal, and the blood-colored avatar showed no signs of aging.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1263'>Chapter 1263: Chaos Egg that Likes to Suffer</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Strange, from the information on the Internet, no one has been able to come out of the Present Hut alive. This should be the most terrifying one among the four huts, but from the looks of it, it’s nothing. There’s no danger at all. Zhou Wen circled the wooden hut a few times and didn’t discover any danger.</p>
<p>Unable to find anything, Zhou Wen waited for a while, but there was still nothing. All he could do was walk out of the hut.</p>
<p>However, the moment he walked out, the phone screen went black, indicating that the blood-colored avatar had died.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Could it be that the Present Hut is a hut that can’t be walked out of? I’ll die if I walk out? Zhou Wen immediately realized what had happened.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart was heavy. It wasn’t because he had died so many times, but on careful thought, the possibility of Lucas being alive was very low.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Lucas was only at the Epic stage when he entered. Even if he was lucky, it was almost impossible for him to survive if he entered the Past and Future Huts.</p>
<p>The Present Hut was even more dangerous—just exiting meant death. It was very unlikely that he would survive in the hut if he had chosen it.</p>
<p>The only chance of survival was probably to enter the Chaos Hut. However, if he encountered Spacetime Piglet, he would still die. After all, it was very difficult for an Epic to defeat a Mythical.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen felt that the chances of Lucas surviving were too low.</p>
<p>“Lucas, Lucas, why did you come to such a place? Did you have nothing better to do? Isn’t it good to get married and have children?” Although Zhou Wen said that, he could understand. It was very difficult for a person like Lucas to live his life in peace.</p>
<p>Among the four huts, Zhou Wen was most interested in the Future Hut. He wanted to figure out what was going on with the darkness.</p>
<p>As for the Past Hut, Zhou Wen’s present strength wasn’t enough to fight a Calamity-grade. It was useless even if he entered.</p>
<p>It was also useless entering the Present Hut. There were no dimensional creatures inside and he would die the moment he came out. It was of no value.</p>
<p>He entered the game again, and this time, Zhou Wen entered the Future Hut. It was still dark, but this time, he didn’t immediately illuminate his surroundings. Instead, he wanted to use his perception to sense what was around him.</p>
<p>The outcome was the same. Before he could sense anything, the game’s screen truly went black.</p>
<p>Strange, it doesn’t seem like I was attacked. How did I die? Is it the nomological forces? Zhou Wen entered again and activated the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder.</p>
<p>In the darkness, the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder immediately burned like a torch, instantly turning to ashes. At the same time, Zhou Wen was killed.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the effects of the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder proved that the power in the darkness was indeed a nomological force, but it instantly reduced the Heaven-Opening Scripture to ashes. The strength of the nomological force was unimaginable.</p>
<p>After entering again, Zhou Wen used the dual powers of the Chaos Egg and the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder.</p>
<p>Something surprised Zhou Wen. Although the Chaos Egg was suppressed by some strange force in the darkness, it wasn’t as intense as the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. It wasn’t reduced to ashes immediately. It lasted for more than ten minutes before it cracked and was corroded by the darkness.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg’s strength is clearly much weaker than the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. It’s not even at the Terror grade, so why can it last much longer? Zhou Wen entered the Future Hut again and again with the question in mind.</p>
<p>After countless deaths, Zhou Wen gradually understood something.</p>
<p>The Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder was an active power. It tried to control the nomological forces. Therefore, when it entered the Future Hut, it would directly resist them. Either one of them would die, and there was no other way.</p>
<p>Therefore, the disadvantaged Heaven-Opening Scripture was instantly wiped out.</p>
<p>However, the Chaos Egg was different. It didn’t resist any nomological forces. It was only passively enduring them. It was self-sufficient and was happy to be in its snug little world.</p>
<p>Therefore, its existence didn’t trigger a strong counterattack from the nomological force. Furthermore, the nomological force it was affected by was actually very small. However, because the nomological force was just too powerful, even a tiny bit was something the Chaos Egg couldn’t withstand. In the end, it was destroyed.</p>
<p>However, in the process of the Chaos Egg being destroyed time and time again, Zhou Wen surprisingly discovered that it was growing.</p>
<p>The First Order of Chaos is really odd. Why can’t it be trained properly? Must it be beaten up to improve? This discovery surprised and delighted Zhou Wen. He was originally vexed over how to advance a Chaos Egg. He never expected there to be some progress.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen entered the Future Hut again and again, causing the Chaos Egg to be destroyed again and again. At the same time, Zhou Wen felt the changes in the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>This First Order of Chaos seems to make sense. Although not fighting back is wrong, not fighting back has its benefits. Zhou Wen gradually discovered the profundity of the First Order of Chaos.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously described the First Order of Chaos as something that chose to be beaten without retaliating, but as Zhou Wen’s understanding of it deepened, he realized that the analogy wasn’t appropriate.</p>
<p>To humans, being beaten was suffering a loss.</p>
<p>However, to the world, collisions represented the transmission of energy. The birth of any life was inseparable from energy.</p>
<p>Instead of calling it a beating, it was better to say that the Chaos Egg was absorbing the energy transmitted to it from the outside world. Regardless of whether the energy was mild or violent, as long as it was energy, the Chaos Egg wouldn’t reject it.</p>
<p>It used the energy from the outside world to build its own snug little world. Instead of calling it a goody-two-shoes who didn’t fight back when beaten, it was better to call it a miser who only allowed income and not expenditure.</p>
<p>The energy—no matter the kind of energy absorbed—could forget about escaping. The Chaos Egg was an energy container that only allowed entry and not exit.</p>
<p>As his comprehension deepened, the Chaos Egg gradually changed.</p>
<p>In the past, Zhou Wen hadn’t liked this Essence Energy Art and hadn’t been able to comprehend its true meaning. Now, Zhou Wen finally understood it. The First Order of Chaos also advanced rapidly in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen engraved the Chaos Egg on the Wheel of Destiny again and again. The appearance of the Chaos Egg didn’t change, but its interior had undergone a tremendous change.</p>
<p>Perhaps Da Vinci hadn’t drawn an egg back then, but the concept of drawing an egg wasn’t wrong. Many times, when one looked at something from different angles, they would discover a different principle.</p>
<p>Something that seemed to be a loss might translate to immense benefits on another level.</p>
<p>The moment Zhou Wen understood that suffering losses was a blessing, the Chaos Egg underwent a qualitative change and finally advanced to the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched as the Chaos Egg advanced, but its appearance didn’t change—it was still a ball.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1264'>Chapter 1264: Chaos Egg Terror Transformation</h3>
<p>Terror Form: Chaos Egg (S-grade)</p>
<p>With its name remaining the same, it didn’t look like it had changed much, but Zhou Wen knew very well that the Chaos Egg was completely different from before.</p>
<p>If the past Chaos Egg was only a firm shell, the present Chaos Egg was a huge energy absorption converter.</p>
<p>Any power that acted on the Chaos Egg would be absorbed and converted by it.</p>
<p>According to Zhou Wen’s understanding, the Chaos Egg was divided into three levels. When the amount of energy absorbed was low, it would directly convert into Essence Energy and store it inside the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>If the power used on the Chaos Egg was too potent, the energy converted by the Chaos Egg would further condense into liquid Essence Energy.</p>
<p>If the power was even greater, the converted Essence Energy would condense further and directly transform into a solid body.</p>
<p>If the entire Chaos Egg was filled with solid Essence Energy, Zhou Wen didn’t know what the outcome would be. It would probably explode.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hadn’t attempted it because the nomological energy in the Future Hut wasn’t enough to fill the Chaos Egg with solid Essence Energy.</p>
<p>It had only just reached the liquid state. Furthermore, it required a few minutes to produce a drop of liquid Essence Energy. Only a Chaos Egg full of liquid Essence Energy could condense into a solid Essence Energy particle.</p>
<p>Although the Chaos Egg didn’t have any offensive strength, it couldn’t attack any creature beyond it.</p>
<p>However, the Terror-form Chaos Egg finally gave him the ability to move and spy on the outside. It was no longer a pure sitting duck. At the very least, it could run now.</p>
<p>The sphere constantly moved in the darkness, but no matter where it moved, one could sense nothing.</p>
<p>What kind of place is this? Zhou Wen spent a long time exploring the Future Hut but found nothing. It left him depressed.</p>
<p>After entering the Future Hut, there was no way to return alive. Zhou Wen could only let the blood-colored avatar leave the Chaos Egg before dying.</p>
<p>It’s really strange. If it’s a maze, there has to be a path, but the darkness is infinite. What’s the meaning of its existence? Zhou Wen thought for a while but failed to figure it out.</p>
<p>He entered the Time Hut dungeon again. This time, Zhou Wen protected his body with the Chaos Egg. The flow of time no longer affected Zhou Wen inside the Chaos Egg; instead, it produced Essence Energy that filled the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suspected that even if his Essence Energy attribute hadn’t reached 81 points, cultivating in such thick Essence Energy would automatically break through to 81 points.</p>
<p>With the Chaos Egg, Zhou Wen had the capital to stay alive in the Time Hut. Even if time flowed very quickly, it didn’t affect Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>As long as he didn’t enter the Future, Present, and Past Huts, the Time Hut wasn’t too difficult for him.</p>
<p>It hadn’t been twenty-four hours, so the Spacetime Piglet hadn’t respawned. Zhou Wen entered the hut again and attempted to use the Chaos Egg to protect himself. He wanted to see if he could leave the hut.</p>
<p>This time, the blood-colored avatar successfully walked out of the hut alive without dying.</p>
<p>Although being able to enter and exit the hut didn’t help Zhou Wen with his farming of dimensional creatures, he was very happy.</p>
<p>If Lucas was in the Present Hut, he could enter to take a look.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen attempted to enter the Past Hut again. He was originally prepared to fight the Calamity-grade creature, but to his surprise, he didn’t see the creature after entering.</p>
<p>He was now deep in a river. Although there was little light here, Zhou Wen could still see his surroundings with his eyesight.</p>
<p>He sized up his surroundings and was suddenly alarmed to discover a huge skeleton on the sandy bottom of the river not far away. The bone marrow looked like a mammal’s. It had a spine and ribs, but it also had a bone-like object that resembled a fin.</p>
<p>The entire skeleton was the size of a corvette. He did not know what type of creature it was. It had horns on its head, but no bones of the expected four limbs could be seen.</p>
<p>All the bones were crystalline like jade and they emitted a terrifying pressure. Even Zhou Wen felt his heart palpitate. It was difficult to imagine how terrifying it would have been when it was alive.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was wondering what creature the skeleton was, he suddenly felt the surrounding river water flow in reverse. Furthermore, it was terrifyingly fast, causing Zhou Wen’s body to involuntarily flow backward with the river.</p>
<p>It was as though a terrifying force was attracting the river to flow backward. Even the terrifying monster’s bones were being sucked along as the river flowed in reverse. It was unimaginably fast.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly used teleportation to rush out of the water and appear in midair.</p>
<p>Floating in midair, Zhou Wen looked around warily. When he saw everything in front of him, his mouth couldn’t help but widen. He didn’t close it for a while.</p>
<p>A huge river surged without any end in sight. It seemed to connect to the left and right horizon, far beyond what the eyes could see.</p>
<p>However, there was a giant who was buried in the river, guzzling the water non-stop.</p>
<p>Every time he drank a mouthful, the water level of the river would drop dozens of feet. In a few mouthfuls, the tiny tributary of the river had already dried up. After drinking a few more mouthfuls, the main river’s main channel also stopped flowing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had felt the river flow in reverse because the giant was drinking water.</p>
<p>Under Zhou Wen’s dumbfounded gaze, the giant sucked the river dry and ran towards the sun with his head held high.</p>
<p>When his huge foot landed, the ground trembled and mountains collapsed. The dust and air waves that stirred up were akin to an atomic bomb’s explosion.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body couldn’t withstand the blast. Under the Chaos Egg’s protection, he was still sent flying. After tumbling for several kilometers, Zhou Wen controlled the Chaos Egg to stop and float in midair.</p>
<p>Before he could figure out his direction, he suddenly heard a buzz that sounded like a dragon’s tendon vibrating. Then, he saw a stream of light flash as the Chaos Egg was penetrated.</p>
<p>The last thing Zhou Wen saw was the Chaos Egg clamping onto an arrow and flying into the sky like a meteor. Then, the phone screen went black again.</p>
<p>Past Hut… Could it be that I’d really returned to the past? Zhou Wen thought of an extremely terrifying possibility.</p>
<p>This was because the scene he had just seen was too familiar. The giant, the river that had been drained—everything was too similar to the myths Zhou Wen had heard from his grandfather.</p>
<p>They are only myths after all. Even if the Past Hut can really return to the past, it shouldn’t be depicting those myths… Unless the myths aren’t just myths… But is it possible… that there was a mythological era in the past? Zhou Wen’s expression changed as he felt terrible.</p>
<p>If the Past Hut is capable of returning to the past, what is the Future Hut’s dark world? Is the future world like that? Zhou Wen found it unbelievable.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1265'>Chapter 1265: Spacetime Mugging</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt a chill run down his spine. If Earth were to be reduced to a pitch-black void in the future, what terrifying battle would have happened to turn Earth into such a state?</p>
<p>It can’t be a real scene from the future, right? If the Time Hut can really see the future, wouldn’t everyone be able to predict the future? Zhou Wen felt that he couldn’t count on it.</p>
<p>Regardless, Zhou Wen could now enter the Chaos Hut and Present Hut without any danger. He could only enter but not exit the Future Hut and the Past Hut for the time being.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen decided to enter the Chaos Hut and Present Hut to see if he could find Lucas.</p>
<p>I hope Lucas is still alive. Zhou Wen walked towards the Time Hut and pushed open the wooden door to enter.</p>
<p>Before entering, Zhou Wen had already used the Chaos Egg. If he used it after entering, he would probably die before he could use the Chaos Egg if he had terrible luck and encountered a time flow that took an instant for a millennium to pass.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The Time Hut in reality was the same as in the game. The wooden table, wooden chairs, wooden bed, and wooden horse looked like a child’s room.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t stay for long as the Chaos Egg slammed open the subsequent wooden door and allowed him passage to the Time Corridor.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the Time Corridor, the Chaos Egg immediately formed some liquid Essence Energy. Based on Zhou Wen’s experience, the flow of time in such a situation would probably have decades pass in a second. If not for the Chaos Egg’s protection, he would probably die of old age in just a few steps.</p>
<p>Indeed, I can’t count on luck. Zhou Wen controlled the Chaos Egg to float towards the Chaos Hut.</p>
<p>As no one had come for a long time, after Zhou Wen entered the hut, not only was there a Spacetime Piglet, but there was also a cloth doll.</p>
<p>The doll was wearing a beautiful princess gown and had long golden hair. It looked beautiful.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had never seen the doll before, nor had he seen any information about her on the Internet. He didn’t dare rashly come out of the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>When Spacetime Piglet and the doll saw a huge ball slam into the hut, they immediately moved.</p>
<p>The light in the Spacetime Piglet’s eyes shot out like a spotlight and shone on the Chaos Egg. The Essence Energy in the Chaos Egg immediately increased significantly, condensing a drop of liquid Essence Energy.</p>
<p>After all, it was only at the Mythical stage. Even if it attacked with all its might, it wouldn’t be of much use against the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>The doll also launched an attack. She held a wand in her hand and raised it above her head as her body spun a few circles with the wand.</p>
<p>The princess dress fluttered due to the spinning, but that wasn’t the main point. As the doll spun, a large amount of liquid Essence Energy was produced in the Chaos Egg. In a moment, it filled half the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>A temporal Terror creature? Zhou Wen was delighted.</p>
<p>Previously, the Spacetime Bandit skill crystal required dual temporal and spatial Terror transformation. Zhou Wen was just wondering where he could find a temporal Terror creature. This cloth doll was very likely one.</p>
<p>In the past, before he had the Chaos Egg, the only thing Zhou Wen would have been able to do was first capture the cloth doll alive and completely subdue it over time before he used the Demon God Body to scan her body and transform into her.</p>
<p>Now that he had the Chaos Egg, there was no need to go through so much trouble. Although he couldn’t use offensive powers in the Chaos Egg, it didn’t stop Zhou Wen from observing it.</p>
<p>After carving the Demon God Bloodline Catalog on the Wheel of Destiny, Zhou Wen’s body underwent a strange change. His eyes turned extremely demonic as they suffused a strange glow.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen focused his gaze on the cloth doll as his body gradually began to change.</p>
<p>The cloth doll and Spacetime Piglet kept attacking the Chaos Egg. Unfortunately, other than adding some Essence Energy liquid to the Chaos Egg, the attacks were futile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t injured in the Chaos Egg at all, and the Demon God Body wasn’t interrupted.</p>
<p>However, there was too much data needed to be scanned to become a Terror-grade creature. The Demon God Eyes constantly scanned it. After a while, Zhou Wen’s body gradually transformed into the doll.</p>
<p>It took him half an hour to fully transform.</p>
<p>Indeed, it’s temporal. Even without looking at the information, Zhou Wen knew the details of the doll from the data he had obtained from the scan. He was immediately overjoyed as he engraved the Godfiend Era, allowing Clown Mask to appear on his face.</p>
<p>Now, I have both Time and Space. I hope I can absorb the Spacetime Bandit skill crystal. Zhou Wen took out the Spacetime Bandit crystal and attempted to absorb it.</p>
<p>The Spacetime Bandit crystal was easily absorbed by Zhou Wen. It transformed into an endless stream of energy that was injected into Zhou Wen’s body. Furthermore, a new Essence Energy circulation path was opened up in his body.</p>
<p>It’s done! Zhou Wen felt the skill crystal’s information constantly surge into his brain as the pleasant surprise on his face intensified.</p>
<p>After the skill crystal was completely absorbed, Zhou Wen eagerly switched on his phone to look at his skill information.</p>
<p>Although he had already grasped the skill information of Spacetime Bandit, Zhou Wen still habitually read the text.</p>
<p>Spacetime Bandit (Terror-grade): Slaughtering that can travel through spacetime.</p>
<p>The information was very simple, but Zhou Wen, who had obtained the information regarding Spacetime Bandit, knew very well that the simple description represented really terrifying meanings.</p>
<p>Spacetime Bandit was an extremely strange spatio-temporal skill. It could delay a person’s actions by 0 to 3 seconds.</p>
<p>This delay didn’t mean that one’s actions would slow down. Instead, they would complete their actions 0 to 3 seconds in advance and use the completed attack to attack the present.</p>
<p>It was a little troublesome to describe. To put it simply, it was like having an avatar. This avatar was the past you from a second or two ago.</p>
<p>At this moment, one could complete the skill, but this skill would be delivered only a second or two later. By then, the real person would have long fled.</p>
<p>Only the attack would injure the opponent, but the opponent’s attack couldn’t touch one because they weren’t there.</p>
<p>In practice, the variations were much more complicated than this. There were also more possibilities. Zhou Wen was momentarily unable to fully express his understanding.</p>
<p>However, he knew very well that this was a very useful skill. If used well, it could be said to be a divine skill.</p>
<p>Spacetime Bandit should have other spatio-temporal skills. Unfortunately, I only encountered one. If more skills had been dropped, I might be able to kill people like a Spacetime Bandit—completely catching people off guard. Zhou Wen felt regretful.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was already very satisfied.</p>
<p>He attempted to use the Spacetime Bandit skill before using Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>Transcendent Flying Immortal didn’t immediately take effect and Zhou Wen left his previous spot.</p>
<p>In less than a second, the spot—where Zhou Wen had been—erupted with Transcendent Flying Immortal’s streams of light that slashed in the direction of the Spacetime Piglet.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Spacetime Piglet used a spatial extension skill, but unfortunately, it was only at the Mythical stage. It failed to escape Transcendent Flying Immortal’s strike and was killed on the spot.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1266'>Chapter 1266: Candy Box</h3>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>A dimensional crystal dropped. It was a wooden crystal with the appearance of the Spacetime Piglet carved on it.</p>
<p>Spacetime Piglet’s skill crystal. Could it be spatial extension? Zhou Wen was delighted.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen couldn’t pick up the skill crystal while inside the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Spacetime Bandit resolved the problem of Zhou Wen being unable to attack while inside the Chaos Egg. As long as he used the characteristics of delayed attacks, he didn’t have to worry about the attacks hitting the Chaos Egg and not being able to leave.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued attacking the doll. After transforming into the doll, he had a good understanding of her various skills. He gained a huge advantage in battle.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with the Chaos Egg protecting him, Zhou Wen was in an invincible position.</p>
<p>Using Spacetime Bandit’s ability, he constantly delayed his attacks. As Zhou Wen still wasn’t very proficient, the delay was very short at the beginning. The delay seldom exceeded a second.</p>
<p>With increased proficiency, he could only produce a delay of two to three seconds at maximum. There was no way to continue delaying unless he had the skill to break through to the Terror grade.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t that the longer the delay, the better. The longer the delay, the higher the requirement on one’s judgment. After all, the other party wasn’t dead—they could move. The longer the delay, the harder it was to hit the opponent.</p>
<p>Of course, if one could predict the opponent’s trajectory, they could attack the opponent’s future position in advance. When the delay time was up, the opponent would be right in that area, making for a spectacular show.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had just begun using this skill, so it wasn’t at that level. He only tried his best to reduce the delay to increase the accuracy of his attacks.</p>
<p>Finally, the cloth doll was sliced into two by the Asura Saber. With a clang, something dropped from the cloth doll’s ruptured body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that even if it wasn’t a Companion Egg, it should be a crystal or something, but on careful look, he was somewhat puzzled when he saw what it was.</p>
<p>What fell out was a rather unique-looking box. It was made of wood and had exquisite patterns engraved on it. It was accompanied by a small and cute bronze lock.</p>
<p>There were a few words engraved on the front of the box.</p>
<p>Sweetie’s candy box? Zhou Wen made the Chaos Egg vanish for an instant and sucked the Spacetime Piglet’s dimensional crystal and the tiny box over. Then, he activated the Chaos Egg again and silently read the words on the box. It felt extremely odd.</p>
<p>He reached out to touch the bronze lock, but it wasn’t locked. It opened the moment he touched it. Zhou Wen removed the bronze lock and opened the small box. Inside the small box was a candy.</p>
<p>The candy was wrapped in pink plastic wrapping paper with the words “Lemon Candy” printed on it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took out the candy and gave it a closer look. No matter how he looked at it, it was packaging produced by a factory. The words were printed mechanically. No matter how he looked at it, it looked like it was artificially produced and not something a dimensional creature should have.</p>
<p>As for the small box, it looked like a man-made product. It wasn’t a dimensional item.</p>
<p>Strange, why would a dimensional creature have these human things? Zhou Wen looked at the candy box again and realized that there was a note at the bottom of the box.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw at a glance that there was a line of crooked words written on the paper. It looked like it had been written by a child who had just learned how to write.</p>
<p>“Sweetie hates lemon candy the most.” Zhou Wen looked at the words and thought to himself, Could it be that someone brought these things in and was killed by the doll before having them snatched away? But that’s not right. The Time Hut’s name is Sweetie’s Hut. Could it be that Sweetie is a human and the Time Hut is hers? The Spacetime Piglet and the doll are her toys…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that his idea was ridiculous. How could a human treat a Terror creature as a toy?</p>
<p>If Sweetie isn’t a human, what could she be? A creature from the dimension? Or a powerful creature born on Earth? But from her words, she doesn’t seem to be such a powerful creature. She’s clearly a child… Many thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind. No matter how he thought about it, he felt that something was amiss. All he could do was put this matter aside. It was more important to find Lucas.</p>
<p>He placed the lemon candy back into the candy box and wanted to store it in the Chaos Bead, but to his surprise, he couldn’t place the lemon candy in the Chaos Bead.</p>
<p>How did this happen? Zhou Wen tried a few more times and realized that every time he wanted to put it in, there seemed to be a strange force repelling the candy box, preventing it from entering the Chaos Bead.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he took out the lemon candy and tried putting it into the Chaos Bead. This time, he succeeded.</p>
<p>Is this candy box actually a spatial item? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly took out some items to see if he could put them inside.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s surprise, the items couldn’t be placed inside. The space in the candy box didn’t expand either.</p>
<p>It’s not a spatial item? Then why can’t it be placed inside the Chaos Bead? Zhou Wen frowned in thought. Suddenly, he thought of something and took out some chocolate candy from the Chaos Bead. The candy was for Ya’er. He had made a huge one-time purchase and occasionally took some out for her to eat.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried putting the chocolate candy into the candy box. In the next second, Zhou Wen was at a loss whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>The large pieces of chocolate were easily placed in the candy box that was much smaller than the chocolate.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took out a pile of various candies and tried putting them in. He succeeded in placing a large pile of candy into the candy box. Once the candy approached the box, they automatically shrank and didn’t occupy any space inside.</p>
<p>Who’s so bored as to make such a spatial item that specializes in storing candy? They went through so much just to store candy. Isn’t that too extravagant? Zhou Wen was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>It was clearly a rare spatial item with quite a large capacity, but it could only be used to store candy. It was useless to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>It’s fine, I guess. I’ll give it to Ya’er. This thing is very small. It’s not bad to use it to store candy for Ya’er. She doesn’t have to ask me for candy whenever she wants to eat some. Zhou Wen placed the candy inside and thought for a moment before taking out the lemon candy.</p>
<p>He did not know if there was anything wrong with this piece of lemon candy. He had to be wary. It was best not to eat it randomly.</p>
<p>He didn’t immediately give the candy box to Ya’er. Zhou Wen wanted to wait a little longer. It wouldn’t be too late to give it to Ya’er if the candy in the candy box remained fine.</p>
<p>After packing up, Zhou Wen left the Chaos Hut and walked towards the Present Hut.</p>
<p>Since Lucas wasn’t in the Chaos Hut, Zhou Wen could only place his last hope on the Present Hut. If he couldn’t find him, there was no need to continue the search.</p>
<p>The Future Hut and Past Hut were places that spelled no return. At the very least, Zhou Wen hadn’t found a way to return.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg slammed open the wooden door and Zhou Wen entered the Present Hut.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1267'>Chapter 1267: A Different Present Hut</h3>
<p>The Present Hut was the same as in-game. It was in the standard Time Hut style—wooden table, wooden chair, wooden bed, and a wooden horse. It was the same as the ordinary Time Hut’s layout.</p>
<p>However, there was something in the Present Hut that wasn’t in-game.</p>
<p>There were more than ten people in the hut. They were either standing, squatting, or sitting. They were clearly breathing, living people made of blood and flesh, but for some reason, they stood there motionless like puppets. Their eyes were fixed in one direction.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated as he didn’t dare come out of the Chaos Egg. He felt unease even inside the Chaos Egg. He hurriedly donned the Dragon King armor and used all sorts of skills like the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder.</p>
<p>After doing all of this, Zhou Wen sized up the situation in the hut again.</p>
<p>The dozen or so people in the hut made the originally small hut seem a little crowded. Zhou Wen quickly realized that Lucas was among them, but he stood there motionless like a realistic wax statue.</p>
<p>Like the others, Lucas stared intently at the only bed in the wooden hut.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare use his eyes to look at the bed. He used Truth Listener’s ability to scan it and realized that the bed in the room was somewhat different from what he had seen in-game.</p>
<p>The wooden bed in-game was an ordinary wooden bed, but this bed had a translucent veil that enveloped the entire bed.</p>
<p>And on the bed was a person. Lucas and company were looking at the person on the bed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen listened carefully and realized that the person lying on the bed was likely a beautiful woman. As she lay there, he could still see her graceful figure. Her face was so exquisite that she didn’t look human.</p>
<p>Human? Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. Although the woman was so beautiful that she didn’t look human, Zhou Wen could sense a human aura from her. She was definitely not a dimensional creature. At the very least, she had some human bloodline.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare go over, much less attempt to call out to Lucas. This was because he didn’t know what had happened. Not only would he fail to save Lucas if he acted rashly, but he might also harm him or even himself.</p>
<p>Just like a person who had been electrocuted, one couldn’t just pull him away. One had to use some insulation tools to save him.</p>
<p>Lucas wasn’t suffering from a case of electrocution, so all the more Zhou Wen couldn’t act rashly. He had to figure out how to save him and not harm him.</p>
<p>Everything was normal with the Chaos Egg—it didn’t produce any Essence Energy. This meant that the Present Hut was the same as in-game. It didn’t have the ability to harm people, nor did it change the flow of time.</p>
<p>The reason Lucas and company had become like this was most likely because of that woman.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was observing, someone suddenly moved.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly looked over and saw a man standing by the bed. He looked to be in his thirties or forties. He was originally standing there motionless, but for some reason, he suddenly moved.</p>
<p>His eyes were blood-red; his eye whites seemed flush with blood as though they were about to explode.</p>
<p>He continued to stare at the woman on the bed and pounced on the wooden bed like a beast.</p>
<p>However, just as his hand touched the muslin bed curtain, his entire body seemed to suffer electrocution. His body stopped immediately as it terminated its charge forward. His body was still convulsing as though it was suffering a fit.</p>
<p>As he constantly convulsed, dried powder kept dropping from his body. In a moment, he turned from a human with flesh and blood into a skeleton. The skeleton didn’t exist for long before it turned to ashes. Then, nothing was left.</p>
<p>Even his clothes and armor seemed to have undergone the ravages of time, turning into dust.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed as he didn’t dare look at the woman on the bed.</p>
<p>However, Truth Listener’s ability made Zhou Wen realize that the woman lying on the bed had become even more exquisite and rosy. She looked even more beautiful.</p>
<p>Indeed, it’s because of that woman! Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated. He couldn’t tell how the woman had attacked the man.</p>
<p>Unfathomable enemies were the most terrifying. Zhou Wen only wanted to take Lucas out without any intention of provoking the woman.</p>
<p>However, taking Lucas out was a problem. Ignoring the question of whether he could touch Lucas, even if he could, how could he take him out of the Present Hut?</p>
<p>Without the Chaos Egg’s protection, leaving the Present Hut was a dead end. However, Zhou Wen was the only one who could use the Chaos Egg—he couldn’t pull Lucas in.</p>
<p>I can only put him in the Chaos Bead. Zhou Wen looked around with some hesitation.</p>
<p>He definitely couldn’t touch Lucas. If anything happened, he wouldn’t even have the chance to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen could only place his sights on the remaining people. He wanted to try putting someone into the Chaos Bead and see if he could take them out of the Present Hut.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously tried doing so in-game. Companion Beasts would die if they entered and exited independently. However, they wouldn’t die if stored inside the Chaos Bead.</p>
<p>However, that was only a Companion Beast test after all. It was safer to use humans as an experiment.</p>
<p>However, if the experiment failed, it was equivalent to killing a person. This left Zhou Wen in a dilemma since choosing anyone appeared inappropriate.</p>
<p>I’m sorry. Since you are ultimately doomed standing here, I’ll make the bet for you. If you win, you can escape and live and I won’t need your gratitude. If you lose, blame your bad luck. Zhou Wen randomly chose a person and was about to deactivate the Chaos Egg and forcefully pull him into the Chaos Bead.</p>
<p>However, before Zhou Wen could do anything, someone suddenly moved. A young man standing beside the table pounced at the wooden bed with bloodshot eyes like the middle-aged man from before.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he immediately deactivated the Chaos Egg. He extended his hand and sucked the young man over before stuffing him into the Chaos Bead.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen activated the Chaos Egg again to protect himself. Just as he was about to leave the Present Hut, something terrifying happened.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen stuffed the young man into the Chaos Bead, his body rapidly aged. In the blink of an eye, he turned from a young man to a dying old man.</p>
<p>He struggled with all his might, but his body quickly dried up and turned to dust. In a moment, he was reduced to ashes that scattered everywhere.</p>
<p>How did this happen? Zhou Wen was alarmed. He hadn’t left the Present Hut and had only placed the person in the Chaos Bead; yet, he had died.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated as he immediately felt that something was amiss. His first reaction was to drive the Chaos Egg to leave the Present Hut.</p>
<p>However, when he turned to look at the wooden door, he saw a beautiful and tall woman standing in front of it. Her beautiful eyes were devoid of any human emotions as she stared at the Chaos Egg.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1268'>Chapter 1268: Battle of the Wooden Hut</h3>
<p>“Come out,” the woman said expressionlessly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that the woman wanted him to come out of the Chaos Egg, but how could he be willing to? If he didn’t come out of it, he might be able to withstand a few attacks. If he went out, he might die.</p>
<p>The woman was straightforward. In less than two seconds after speaking, she slapped out at the Chaos Egg with her palm.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was inside the Chaos Egg. Even with all sorts of flight maneuvering skills, he couldn’t fly with the Chaos Egg as it was rather slow, so he immediately felt a terrifying invisible force lash at the Chaos Egg, sending it flying like a ball.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg was like a bouncing ball as it quickly bounced back and forth in the wooden hut. It slammed into the people in the room. As for the wooden table and chair in the room, even though they had been struck, they didn’t budge, nor were they damaged in the slightest.</p>
<p>Inside the Chaos Egg, diamond-like solid Essence Energy appeared. Each one was the size of a cat’s eye, shocking Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Previously, the doll’s attack could only transform into a small amount of liquid Essence Energy, but this woman’s casual strike had condensed so much solid Essence Energy.</p>
<p>If she were to attack with all her might, the kind of power involved alarmed Zhou Wen. Perhaps the Chaos Egg would really explode from the Essence Energy.</p>
<p>Calamity grade. This woman is definitely at the Calamity grade, but are there really Calamity-grade humans? Zhou Wen suspected that she wasn’t a real human.</p>
<p>Currently, the only human Calamity that Zhou Wen knew of was Wang Mingyuan. Strictly speaking, Wang Mingyuan was no longer human. It was obvious that he had an inhuman aura. As for the human aura on this woman, Zhou Wen couldn’t tell what difference she had from ordinary humans.</p>
<p>“Wait.” Zhou Wen hurriedly shouted when he saw that the woman was about to silently attack again.</p>
<p>The woman stared at Zhou Wen indifferently and said, “Come out.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and guessed that his Chaos Egg couldn’t withstand a Calamity-grade attack. At most, it could last a little longer. It didn’t mean much, so he deactivated the Chaos Egg and revealed his true body.</p>
<p>However, he was still wearing the Dragon King armor and Clown Mask. When he came out of the Chaos Egg, she still couldn’t see what he looked like.</p>
<p>“Human?” The woman sized up Zhou Wen as though she was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you also human?” Zhou Wen probed.</p>
<p>The woman ignored him and stared at his body before saying indifferently, “Strip.”</p>
<p>“Strip?” Zhou Wen was momentarily taken aback, but he quickly understood that she wanted him to take off the Dragon King armor.</p>
<p>“Why do you want me to take it off?” Zhou Wen definitely wouldn’t take it off.</p>
<p>“Die or strip.” The woman gave Zhou Wen two choices.</p>
<p>“Alright… I…” As Zhou Wen spoke, his body suddenly moved rapidly. He pushed his Transcendent Flying Immortal stance to its limits and instantly circled around the woman and rushed towards the wooden door.</p>
<p>The woman didn’t chase after him, but Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated. He had an ominous feeling as he hurriedly summoned the Chaos Egg to protect himself.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>It was as though a heavy hammer had smashed into the Chaos Egg. The Chaos Egg was almost flattened before it bounced up and shot around the room.</p>
<p>Inside the Chaos Egg, solid Essence Energy condensed and fell, filling up about a sixth of the space.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. He had never expected such a sicko to appear in the hut. He originally imagined that the Present Hut was safe, but now, it was as though he was doomed. His plans couldn’t keep up with the changes.</p>
<p>Another seven or eight of those strikes would probably fill the Chaos Egg with solid Essence Energy.</p>
<p>This can’t continue. Many solutions flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind, but few were effective against a Calamity-grade entity.</p>
<p>However, the woman didn’t care. She slapped the Chaos Egg in the air again and again, slamming it against the wall as it bounced back. The terrifying force nearly flattened the Chaos Egg, but it resisted the pressure and didn’t explode.</p>
<p>However, a large amount of solid Essence Energy appeared in the Chaos Egg. After a few instances, it nearly buried Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Although the Chaos Egg was better at storage than Zhou Wen had imagined, it was already half full after seven or eight strikes. At this rate, it couldn’t escape the fate of being filled.</p>
<p>Absorb, absorb, I’ll just keep absorbing! Zhou Wen desperately absorbed the solid Essence Energy inside as he used Spacetime Bandit.</p>
<p>The ability of Spacetime Bandit was very strange. When using it, he could use other skills simultaneously. Those skills wouldn’t be released immediately.</p>
<p>After a delay of 0 to 3 seconds, even if Zhou Wen had already left the area, it was as though an invisible avatar was releasing the skill Zhou Wen had used.</p>
<p>Under Zhou Wen’s crazy casting, sword beams appeared where the Chaos Egg flew over and shot at the woman like a rain of swords.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Heart Defying Sword Art was considered a powerful sword technique. With three thousand sword intents in one body, every sword beam’s sword intent was different.</p>
<p>The sword beams arrived in front of the woman and her eyes narrowed. As though frightened by her gaze, the sword beams immediately stopped in midair.</p>
<p>The sword beams naturally weren’t frightened. Instead, the woman’s eyes contained a terrifying power that forced the sword beams to stop.</p>
<p>The look in the woman’s eyes changed as the sword beams that filled the sky shattered, turning into countless specks of light.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and rushed out of the Chaos Egg. However, he didn’t charge at the woman. Instead, he charged at the people lying on the ground.</p>
<p>In order to survive, Zhou Wen couldn’t care less about the consequences. He grabbed two people on the ground and threw one in each hand at the woman.</p>
<p>The woman didn’t kill the people Zhou Wen had thrown with a glance. Instead, she darted her eyes and the two of them froze in midair before landing to the side.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t stop as he constantly grabbed the puppet-like people on the ground and threw them at the woman.</p>
<p>The woman didn’t harm those people. She only controlled them to land behind her, leaving Zhou Wen with nothing to grab.</p>
<p>Soon, more than ten people had been thrown over by Zhou Wen. With nothing to grab, he reached out to grab the chair. However, it was as though it had been nailed to the ground. He couldn’t move it no matter how hard he tried.</p>
<p>He wanted to flip the table, but the outcome was the same. After using all his strength, the table remained motionless. As the woman’s gaze landed on him, Zhou Wen immediately felt his body being controlled by an invisible force, preventing him from moving.</p>
<p>The woman walked towards Zhou Wen step by step, her eyes turning sharper. Under the woman’s gaze, the Dragon King armor on Zhou Wen’s body cracked and was about to shatter.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder appeared above Zhou Wen’s head. It flipped open page after page, and some mysterious scriptures shimmered with a profound divine light.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, who couldn’t move, suddenly leaped up and slashed at the woman just inches from him with the Asura Saber.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1269'>Chapter 1269: Zhou Wen’s Specialty</h3>
<p>The wooden hut was small to begin with, and the woman was already very close to Zhou Wen. This strike was just too close to the woman. With Zhou Wen’s saber speed, he only needed an instant to strike the woman.</p>
<p>However, at such a close distance, the Asura Saber stopped. Under the woman’s gaze, the Asura Saber trembled and couldn’t advance another inch. It stopped in front of the woman and trembled incessantly. It was no different from a struggling, dying fish.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used his other hand to press on the saber’s back, but the Asura Saber was still unable to proceed forward any further.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The woman’s eyes narrowed as Zhou Wen was sent flying with his saber. He slammed into the wooden bed and several parts of the Dragon King armor shattered. Zhou Wen spewed out a mouthful of blood as he felt a bone-chilling pain in his chest.</p>
<p>At some point in time, the woman had walked to the bed and reached out to grab the Clown Mask on Zhou Wen’s face.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly widened his eyes as a shadow that resembled Great Brahma appeared. The fourth face with its back facing the black hole slowly turned. As the face turned, the black hole behind it grew bigger and bigger, as though it wanted to devour everything.</p>
<p>Countless wraiths screamed inside as countless hellspawn roared as though they wanted to turn the world into purgatory.</p>
<p>The woman glared at the black hole that resembled the entrance to hell, but the corners of her mouth curled up slightly as she revealed a look of disdain. She pressed her palm at the black hole.</p>
<p>Her fingers were smooth and flawless, as perfect as the world’s most perfect white jade.</p>
<p>This palm contained unparalleled power, as though it could suppress all worlds. The terrifying black hole gradually shrank under the palm.</p>
<p>The wraiths in the black hole screamed as the terrifying roars became weaker and weaker until they could no longer be heard.</p>
<p>As for the black hole, it was compressed to the point of becoming a rift. Great Brahma’s huge body became as tiny as an ant under the suppression.</p>
<p>The terrifying palm had already occupied the world and was about to smash Great Brahma and Zhou Wen into pieces.</p>
<p>However, Great Brahma and Zhou Wen suddenly vanished. They vanished from the woman’s terrifying palm, leaving the woman somewhat alarmed.</p>
<p>It was impossible for a Terror-grade spatial ability to break through her suppression. In fact, spatial teleportation wasn’t that easy to use in the hut. It was very easy to have problems entering the spatial passageway.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen vanished just like that. Furthermore, another humanoid creature appeared almost at the same time under the woman’s palm. The woman failed to retract her palm in time as the terrifying power in her jade hand crushed the humanoid creature into ashes.</p>
<p>Although it was only a fleeting glance, the woman could already see that the humanoid creature she had crushed to death was one of the people standing in the room.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen threw the person over, she had placed him behind her, near the wooden hut’s entrance.</p>
<p>The woman realized something and turned her head to see that Zhou Wen had already rushed out of the Present Hut under the protection of the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>The woman’s eyes were filled with anger. The mere human had actually escaped under her nose. Furthermore, she had accidentally killed her prey. This was something her pride couldn’t accept.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, the woman rushed out of the Present Hut.</p>
<p>Although there was only a wooden door between the Present Hut and the Time Corridor, it was like a teleportation door that separated two worlds. Even if the woman wanted to leave, she needed the same time to pass through the door.</p>
<p>When she arrived at the Time Corridor, she saw Zhou Wen passing through another wooden door and returning to a Time Hut.</p>
<p>The woman chased after him again. She was furious, but the time she passed through the wooden door prevented her from using her powerful strength and speed.</p>
<p>When she entered the Time Hut, she saw Zhou Wen pass through the wooden door and leave.</p>
<p>“Let’s see where you can run to. No matter where you go—be it heaven or hell—you will definitely die today.” Almost no one could see the woman move as she had already entered the wooden door and rushed out of the Time Hut.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen rushed out of the Time Hut, he turned his head and saw the woman’s face coming out of the door, but her body was still inside the door enveloped by light.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen used the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art’s interstellar teleportation ability and arrived above Venus.</p>
<p>When he threw those people at the women, he had already left coordinates on them. Then, he used Great Brahma to attract the woman’s attention, making her think that he was in a hopeless situation. Finally, he swapped positions with one of them using Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping.</p>
<p>He originally imagined that the woman wouldn’t discover that he wasn’t the one who had died, but her eyesight and reaction were much better than he had imagined. She immediately discovered Zhou Wen’s exchange with the person and chased after him without giving him any time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen teleported to Venus as a precaution. If the woman could still catch up, he could use the dungeon on Venus to fend her off.</p>
<p>After arriving on Venus, Zhou Wen realized that he was near the rift valley where he had previously discovered the metal flower. He couldn’t help but have a thought as he immediately instant transmitted towards it.</p>
<p>It would be fine if the woman couldn’t catch up. If she could catch up, perhaps he could try to use the metal flower’s power to stop her for a period of time.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen finished instant transmission, a tall woman appeared where he had been. Like a ghost, she gradually materialized from an illusion. She was none other than the woman who had been pursuing him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sensed the woman’s appearance, but he wasn’t flustered. Although she was a Calamity-grade expert with overwhelming strength, she might not be able to kill him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen might not be the strongest in other aspects, but his ability to survive and escape made him an expert among experts.</p>
<p>The experience of dying countless times in-game was definitely not a waste of time. Having experienced countless deaths, Zhou Wen definitely knew how to avoid death.</p>
<p>After instant transmitting to the edge of the rift valley, Zhou Wen instant transmitted into the valley again without any hesitation.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg appeared outside his body the moment he finished instant transmission. It fell to the bottom like a huge ball, and that was where the metal flower was.</p>
<p>As the Chaos Egg fell, the solid Essence Energy in it suddenly increased greatly. Soon, it filled half the Chaos Egg, making Zhou Wen delighted instead of being alarmed.</p>
<p>The greater the reaction of the Chaos Egg, the more terrifying the metal flower was.</p>
<p>If it were any other time, Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t wish to encounter such a terrifying creature, but at this moment, he hoped that the metal flower would be as strong as possible.</p>
<p>The woman followed closely into the valley. Without the restrictions of the teleportation door, she was much faster than Zhou Wen. She instantly arrived beside the Chaos Egg and reached out to grab it. She appeared even faster than Zhou Wen had imagined. The Chaos Egg hadn’t reached the bottom of the valley and was only halfway in its descent.</p>
<p>Heaven bless me! Zhou Wen could only pray to the heavens, hoping that the metal flower would react.</p>
<p>In theory, when any creature’s territory was invaded by unfamiliar creatures, they would first pay attention to the creatures that could threaten them.</p>
<p>As for the Chaos Egg itself, it posed very little threat. If the metal flower didn’t cower, it might treat the woman as its first target.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1270'>Chapter 1270: Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>The woman’s fingers were long, but they were much smaller than the Chaos Egg. However, when her fingers grabbed the Chaos Egg, it was as though an invisible finger force extended out and held it.</p>
<p>Under the invisible pressure of the fingers, the Chaos Egg peeled off as if it was about to explode.</p>
<p>Is there no reaction from the metal flower? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. He was about to be buried alive by the constantly produced solid Essence Energy in the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was planning on using the second, third, or fourth backup plan to escape, he suddenly felt the pressure on the Chaos Egg decrease significantly.</p>
<p>Buzz!</p>
<p>A strange buzzing sound entered Zhou Wen’s ears. The woman holding the Chaos Egg seemed to weaken her grip. She looked at the bottom of the valley and saw the metal flower. The buzzing sound seemed to come from there..</p>
<p>The woman stared at the bottom of the valley. Her clothes were trembling slightly like ripples in water.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt the surface of the Chaos Egg tremble as well, but the power of the vibrations didn’t enter the Chaos Egg. Instead, many solid Essence Energy particles appeared inside.</p>
<p>Has the metal flower reacted? Zhou Wen was delighted, but this feeling soon ended. This was because the Essence Energy in the chaos was about to be filled. Zhou Wen’s entire body was already buried in solid Essence Energy.</p>
<p>As solid Essence Energy couldn’t be compressed further, the Chaos Egg began to expand after it was filled.</p>
<p>Situated in the middle of the massive amount of pure Essence Energy, Zhou Wen didn’t feel any happiness from obtaining Essence Energy.</p>
<p>The woman seemed eager to rush out of the rift valley, but for some reason, her body retreated a distance, as she failed to escape the rift valley.</p>
<p>An invisible force seemed to suppress her body, preventing her from rushing out of the rift valley.</p>
<p>“To think I fought countless battles in the past and killed countless Terror-grade experts. Now, a mere flower actually dares to provoke me.” The woman seemed to be truly furious. Her muslin clothes fluttered and transformed into pillars of light that descended from the sky and struck the rift valley.</p>
<p>At that moment, the woman was like a reincarnating saintess, purifying all the evil in the world. The beams of light were shocking, as though they wanted to flatten the entire rift valley.</p>
<p>The terrifying pillars of light struck the bottom of the valley, but they didn’t produce any rumbling sounds. Before they approached the metal flower, they suddenly disintegrated and shattered into specks of light.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen noticed something. There was a strange vibrational force in the rift valley. Anything that entered the rift valley would be affected by this vibrational force and quickly disintegrated, disintegrating into extremely tiny particles that scattered across the bottom of the valley.</p>
<p>What power is this? This was the first time Zhou Wen had seen such power. Although he was curious, he didn’t have the luxury of time to be curious.</p>
<p>As it was simultaneously affected by the woman’s finger pressure and the vibrational force of the metal flower, the Chaos Egg had already expanded to the size of a hot air balloon. It was filled with solid Essence Energy that had nearly squashed Zhou Wen flat.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was already desperately absorbing the Essence Energy, the bit of Essence Energy he could absorb was only a drop in the ocean. It didn’t affect the overall situation.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I’ll have to use Plan B. Zhou Wen knew that he was in the crossfire of two Calamity Zones. He could only survive using the Chaos Egg. If the Chaos Egg exploded, he probably wouldn’t even have the chance to teleport out.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg grew bigger and bigger until it was almost transparent. Zhou Wen didn’t dare wait any longer. He put on his armor and various equipment before using Spacetime Bandit to use Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen rushed down the rift valley, he had deliberately touched a stone outside, leaving behind the mark of Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping. Now, he could use it to exchange positions to escape the rift valley.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was also prepared for failure. With the two Calamity Zones overlapping, it was still a question if Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping would work.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping, but due to Spacetime Bandit’s delayed effect, Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping showed its effect when he deactivated the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt his armor tremble as though it was about to disintegrate. Thankfully, in an instant, he vanished from the rift valley and returned to the mountain ridge outside.</p>
<p>As for the woman, a Venusian rock appeared in her hand. The rock couldn’t withstand the woman’s and the metal flower’s power and shattered.</p>
<p>I’m finally out! Zhou Wen was overjoyed.</p>
<p>The Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping technique, which combined the powers of the Godfiend Era and the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping powers, was even more bizarre than he had imagined. Even the Calamity Zones couldn’t hold him back.</p>
<p>It lives up to its name. Zhou Wen didn’t dare stay any longer as he quickly instant transmitted in the direction of the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>If the woman chased after him again, he would rush into the Venusian dimension and use the Calamity creature inside to deal with the strange woman.</p>
<p>However, after a few instant transmissions, he realized that the woman wasn’t following him. As for the rift valley, terrifying energy fluctuations erupted. Holy light bombarded the area as ear-piercing rumbles sounded from time to time. Large swaths of rocks cracked as mountains collapsed, as though it was the end of the world.</p>
<p>That woman actually failed to escape and chase after me? Zhou Wen was delighted. Ignoring the woman, he used Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping again.</p>
<p>A tiny blade of grass appeared where Zhou Wen was, and he returned to the door of the Time Hut.</p>
<p>This was also the mark he had left behind after rushing out of the Time Hut. However, he hadn’t dared to return previously because he was afraid that the woman would follow him. Now, with the woman fighting the metal flower, she shouldn’t be able to catch up so quickly.</p>
<p>He summoned the Chaos Egg again. It was still filled with solid Essence Energy, bulging the Chaos Egg greatly. Zhou Wen couldn’t care less as he barely made the Chaos Egg enter the Time Hut.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen arrived in the hut, but the scene inside gave him a fright.</p>
<p>The dozen or so people from before were mostly young adults. They were at most in their forties or fifties, but now, most of them had turned into wrinkled old men who were dead on the ground.</p>
<p>Only five people were still alive. Two of them looked very old. Lucas and the other two looked rather normal—they hadn’t aged drastically.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he placed the younger person into the Chaos Bead and attempted to leave the hut.</p>
<p>This time, the young man didn’t die of old age quickly. Nothing happened after Zhou Wen took him out of the Present Hut. Instead, he woke up shortly after.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted. After confirming that he was fine, he rushed back to the Present Hut and stored the people and corpses away, including Lucas.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1271'>Chapter 1271: Battle Spectating</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“Ah! Why am I here?” Lucas looked at Zhou Wen and Philo in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen saved you. Hurry up and thank him.” Philo was delighted. She was originally a little angry at Zhou Wen for forcefully imprisoning her.</p>
<p>However, she never expected Lucas to be in front of her after Zhou Wen released her. Although he looked a little groggy, he didn’t seem to have any problems. She couldn’t help but feel grateful and ashamed. She never expected Zhou Wen to take the risk to enter the Time Hut and rescue Lucas. She had previously suspected that Zhou Wen didn’t dare enter to save Lucas because he was afraid of death.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, how did you get me out of the Present Hut? I thought I was doomed,” Lucas said with lingering fear.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen wanted to ask what he had experienced in the Present Hut, it wasn’t the time for a chit chat.</p>
<p>“Now, the terrifying existence in the hut is pursuing us. Everyone, split up and escape. We’ll talk later,” Zhou Wen said as he instant transmitted away.</p>
<p>He wasn’t sure when the woman would catch up. He had already scattered the people and corpses in different places.</p>
<p>Now that he was separated from Lucas, even if the woman really caught up, she wouldn’t be in the mood to capture Lucas.</p>
<p>“The mighty Lucas shall fight alongside you…” Zhou Wen vaguely heard Lucas’s voice, but he ignored him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen teleported to Venus again, but he didn’t appear near the rift valley. However, he could sense the energy fluctuations coming from it. Despite being so far away, he could still feel the ground tremble. Clearly, the battle was still ongoing.</p>
<p>What’s the origin of that metal flower? It can actually fight that terrifying woman to such an extent. It looks like it’s on par with her. Zhou Wen sensed the power fluctuations and realized that the metal flower’s vibrational forces were still very powerful. It wasn’t suppressed by the woman.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare get too close. He only sensed the Essence Energy fluctuations from afar and roughly determined the battle situation.</p>
<p>As it was too far away, it was beyond Great Brahma and Truth Listener’s range.</p>
<p>Sensing the power fluctuations weakening, Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and dived towards the rift valley. The terrifying woman wanted him dead. If there was a chance, Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t let her off.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t her match, so this seemed to be an excellent opportunity. The woman’s and the metal flower’s powers seemed to be fading, so Zhou Wen decided to take the risk to take a look.</p>
<p>If he let the woman escape safely, she might chase after him when she recovered. Therefore, Zhou Wen knew that this was a rare opportunity. He had to take a look.</p>
<p>He put on the Invisibility Cloak and used the invisibility function. Although he didn’t know if it was useful against a Calamity-grade existence, it gave him a sense of comfort.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen constantly approached the rift valley, he realized that the energy fluctuations there were still extremely terrifying. Holy light descended and the rift had long been reduced to a basin, not a narrow rift valley.</p>
<p>The power of Calamity-grade existences is too terrifying. Thankfully, this is Venus. If this were Earth, I wonder how many people would die. Zhou Wen moved towards the energy fluctuations. As they were so powerful, he couldn’t see the situation inside if he was too far away.</p>
<p>He had to know what was happening inside before he knew if there was a chance.</p>
<p>The woman’s Holy Light was fine. The power of the Holy Light was very dense. It basically struck the basin and what spread out were only the aftershocks. Zhou Wen wore the Dragon King armor and with Great Brahma’s power, it wasn’t difficult to withstand it.</p>
<p>However, the metal flower’s vibrational power was range-based. It spread far into the distance, but the vibrations remained potent. It made Zhou Wen feel uncomfortable because the Dragon King armor was close to shattering.</p>
<p>This won’t do. If I continue approaching, the armor will disintegrate. Zhou Wen felt the Dragon King armor creaking. It was about to collapse, so he had to stop approaching.</p>
<p>He was still dozens of kilometers away from the basin, and he still couldn’t sense the situation inside. However, there was nothing he could do. All he could do was wait patiently, hoping that he could approach again when the surging forces weakened.</p>
<p>After waiting for more than half an hour, the battle over there was still abnormally terrifying. There was no way of approaching.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>At this moment, the humans on Earth also discovered this terrifying battle.</p>
<p>The Cube didn’t stream the battle. It only seemed interested in the creatures that had entered the metal dimensional zone. It ignored all other creatures.</p>
<p>The reason humans were able to discover this battle was thanks to the various factions using spatial teleportation to place some artificial satellites near Venus.</p>
<p>Originally, the artificial satellites were only used to observe the situation in the Venusian dimensional zones. They never expected to see such a huge battle.</p>
<p>However, by the time they discovered this battle, it was already towards the end.</p>
<p>The artificial satellite of the Special Investigation Bureau was the first to discover the terrifying Holy Light there. As the director of the bureau, Wei Ge immediately attempted to get the artificial satellite to film the situation there.</p>
<p>Although they could only capture the Holy Light and the collapsing rocks, it was still shocking. Such power was clearly not caused by Venusian internal movement. It had to be a result of some creatures fighting, but they couldn’t see it.</p>
<p>After this news spread, many factions quickly used their artificial satellites to observe the situation. However, the scene they could see was similar to the bureau’s.</p>
<p>“What terrifying power. It’s a Calamity-grade battle, right?” Blood Shaman said with lingering fear as he looked at the projection obtained from the artificial satellite.</p>
<p>Cave Era said, “The two parties involved in the battle are undoubtedly at the Calamity grade. If we were present, we might be able to figure out something. Although the artificial satellite’s filming capabilities are good, it will probably be very difficult to capture the true body of Calamity-grade creatures.”</p>
<p>“Why are they fighting there and not in the Venusian dimensional zone? Could there be something special about that place?” Hermit said in thought.</p>
<p>“Let’s wait and see. Perhaps there will be an answer soon,” Immortal said as he looked at the projection calmly, as though he wasn’t anxious at all.</p>
<p>Although Hermit had the intention to suggest sending people to watch the battle, he recalled that his radical actions had caused Skysplit Tower to collapse, causing the League of Guardians to be disadvantaged. He didn’t dare make the request.</p>
<p>While everyone was paying attention to this battle, Zhou Wen was also waiting. Unfortunately, he hadn’t found a chance to approach.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was fretting, he suddenly felt a consciousness tremble in the Chaos Bead. It left him slightly taken aback as he probed the Chaos Bead with his consciousness. He immediately realized that it was the Galaxy Shell Dragon.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>The moment Zhou Wen opened the Chaos Bead, the Galaxy Shell Dragon flew back and returned to Zhou Wen, transforming into a tattoo.</p>
<p>However, the current Galaxy Shell Dragon was somewhat different from before. The sphere it was hugging had also vanished.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1272'>Chapter 1272: Prisoned Dragon</h3>
<p>The original Galaxy Shell Dragon was crystalline, resembling an Australian lobster.</p>
<p>But now, although it was still in its tattoo form, it was very different from before.</p>
<p>The color had turned into a translucent jade-white color. It was crystalline and there seemed to be fog flowing inside. It looked dreamlike, as though it didn’t exist in the mortal world.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Shell Dragon’s appearance had also changed. Although it still looked like a lobster, its head looked more like a dragon’s. Its body had clearly broadened, and the carapace on its back had become thicker. Furthermore, it appeared to have many edges like a diamond. It looked hard and beautiful, resplendent like stars.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up when he sensed the information from the Galaxy Shell Dragon. He hurriedly took out his phone to take a closer look.</p>
<p>Prisoned Dragon: Terror (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Unbreakable</p>
<p>Life Soul: Courses Reverse At Extremes</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Absolute Defense</p>
<p>Terror Form: Prisoned Dragon</p>
<p>Strength: 99</p>
<p>Speed: 99</p>
<p>Constitution: 99</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 99</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Death Cage, Ghost Armor, Prisoned Dragon Lock, Trapped Dragon Ascension</p>
<p>Companion Form: Armor</p>
<p>It wasn’t unexpected that the Galaxy Shell Dragon had advanced to the Terror grade. After all, the jade pearl it had absorbed belonged to the Calamity-grade Dragon Turtle. It would be strange if it couldn’t advance to the Terror grade.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s surprise, things weren’t as simple as Prisoned Dragon advancing to the Terror grade. Even its species had changed.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen didn’t know if it was the advancement of the Galaxy Shell Dragon or if the jade ball’s power had occupied its body, allowing it to carry on its life in another form.</p>
<p>Regardless of the situation, it only brought Zhou Wen benefits. Prisoned Dragon’s stats were undoubtedly top-notch at the Terror grade, especially its defense. Zhou Wen felt that it was even possible to vie for the position of the number one defensive Companion Beast at the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Absolute Defense could be used indefinitely now. There was no longer a time limit.</p>
<p>With the augmentation of the Unbreakable Life Providence, its defense was crazy. With the Courses Reverse At Extremes Life Soul, it could reflect all sorts of attacks. It was even more porcupine-like than a porcupine.</p>
<p>The Terror transformation of Prisoned Dragon and the various skills that were different from before still needed to be tested in actual combat.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately replaced the Dragon King armor with the Prisoned Dragon armor. The black armor was instantly replaced by a crystalline, translucent white armor. Clouds rose from the armor as endless starlight surrounded it. It looked gorgeous and dazzling like a hero’s amazing appearance.</p>
<p>Isn’t this a little too exaggerated? It’s so ostentatious that I can see it from afar. How can I launch a sneak attack and hide while escaping? Zhou Wen didn’t like such gorgeous armor. It was the inconspicuous armor like the Dragon King armor that suited Zhou Wen’s aesthetic standards.</p>
<p>However, the Prisoned Dragon armor’s defense was clearly much higher than the Dragon King armor. Zhou Wen wore the Prisoned Dragon armor and couldn’t sense the effects of the vibrations.</p>
<p>As expected of Absolute Defense… Zhou Wen was delighted as he attempted to approach the basin.</p>
<p>As he got closer and closer to the battlefield, Prisoned Dragon’s Absolute Defense had already taken effect. It forcefully endured the shockwaves of the Calamity-grade power as he advanced. The armor wasn’t damaged at all, and the impact on Zhou Wen’s body had been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen finally sensed the situation on the battlefield. The rift valley had turned into a huge depression that was bigger than a city.</p>
<p>The spot beneath the flower had turned into a long pillar that was probably a few hundred meters tall. It was like an unreachable lighthouse.</p>
<p>The metal flower looked very small, but its roots were bottomless. The entire pillar was filled with its roots that extended deep underground. It was unknown how long they were.</p>
<p>Venus had many metal ores, and it was especially rich with metallic elements. The ground below was almost like an alloy. It was unimaginable that such a tiny flower could take root so deeply in the metal.</p>
<p>The Holy Light on the woman’s body became more and more intense as beams of Holy Light blasted down. It couldn’t just be called Holy Light. Instead, it was like the descent of angels filled with Holy Light. Every Holy Light Angel that descended carried unparalleled Holy Light power as they charged at the flower as though they were sacrificing themselves.</p>
<p>However, the flower remained motionless. It only emitted a buzzing sound. No matter how terrifying the power of the descending Holy Light Angels was, it failed to reach the flower. The strongest Holy Light Angel automatically disintegrated into particles two to three meters away from the flower.</p>
<p>How powerful! Zhou Wen didn’t know the origins of the metal flower, but this ability was just fantastic. Anything that approached it would disintegrate. It looked invincible.</p>
<p>The flower wasn’t human. It didn’t know arrogance. Otherwise, it would proudly look down on the woman. The woman had used all sorts of methods, but she had failed to injure the flower at all.</p>
<p>This flower… Could it be the legendary Withered Flower? That’s not right. The Withered Flower can only reduce life to dust, but this metal flower can disintegrate things through vibrational forces… What the hell is this… The woman frowned. She couldn’t tell the metal flower’s ability.</p>
<p>The crux of the matter was that she didn’t wish to fight the metal flower, but she couldn’t rush out of the metal flower’s domain. The other party had already locked her down firmly. Once she revealed her weakness, she would suffer a calamity.</p>
<p>That darn bastard. Don’t let me catch him. Otherwise, I’ll definitely rip him to pieces. The woman hated Zhou Wen to the core. If it wasn’t for him, she wouldn’t have encountered such an unknown and thorny metal flower.</p>
<p>As she was thinking, the woman suddenly felt someone touch her Calamity Zone. After carefully identifying it, she realized that a human had entered the battlefield.</p>
<p>The woman couldn’t be sure if it was Zhou Wen. The armor on him was completely different from the one he had previously worn. She couldn’t tell if the person inside was Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, on second thought, the woman thought that it didn’t matter if it was the human from before. For a person to suddenly barge in and withstand the assault of the Calamity Zone, this seemed to be good news for her.</p>
<p>A few thoughts flashed through the woman’s mind as she quickly made up her mind. Regardless of whether the human was the one she had been pursuing, she could use him now.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare get too close. He stopped at the edge of the battlefield where he could spy. Not long after, he suddenly felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>He saw the woman take out something. Before Zhou Wen could see what it was, his body involuntarily flew towards the woman.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s limbs flailed wildly as he tried to instant transmit away or stop himself from flying towards the woman, but it was to no avail. Even Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping failed to bring him back to the spot he had previously marked.</p>
<p>Oh no! Zhou Wen immediately felt that something was amiss. He saw that the woman was holding a yellow paper talisman.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1273'>Chapter 1273: Plan C</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>The yellow paper talisman looked somewhat similar to the Substitute Talisman that Zhou Wen had drawn. From the patterns, they seemed to come from the same lineage, but the runes and paper were somewhat different.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what the runes meant, but the power of the runes sucked him towards the woman. He couldn’t escape no matter how hard he tried. His body flew faster and faster as he instantly stuck to the runes and was grabbed by the woman.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen reacted quickly and activated the Chaos Egg in time. The woman only grabbed the Chaos Egg and didn’t grab Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>However, the solid Essence Energy in the Chaos Egg was already full. If the woman used any more strength, he would probably explode.</p>
<p>The woman didn’t pinch the Chaos Egg but grabbed it and threw it at the metal flower like she was throwing a baseball.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to use the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping technique to return to the mark he had left far away, but he was alarmed to discover that the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping technique was still unusable. As for the yellow paper talisman, it was stuck to the Chaos Egg, suppressing his strength.</p>
<p>As the Chaos Egg rapidly flew towards the metal flower, the vibrations it endured intensified. The solid Essence Energy inside increased greatly and was about to burst it.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I’ll have to use Plan C. Zhou Wen had already considered this problem. It wasn’t impossible to quickly expend the Essence Energy in the Chaos Egg. There was still a way.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen took out the Immortal Culling Sword and held the hilt. He fused with Slaughterer and used Immortal Slaying to forcefully pull it out.</p>
<p>Just a slight movement from the Immortal Culling Sword sucked away a massive amount of Essence Energy. The solid Essence Energy in the Chaos Egg vanished in large chunks. The Essence Energy that the Chaos Egg produced wasn’t enough for the absorption of Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>The Essence Energy required by the Immortal Culling Sword was massive. Even Zhou Wen didn’t know how much it required. The last time he used the Immortal Culling Sword, it was the Sigh of the King that provided most of the energy. The energy he provided was almost negligible.</p>
<p>According to Zhou Wen’s calculations, Terror-grade Essence Energy was just a drop in the ocean for the Immortal Culling Sword. Only Calamity-grade creatures could provide the Essence Energy needed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already made up his mind when he came. It would be best if he could find an opportunity to kill the woman. If she caught him again, he would try to use the converted Essence Energy to draw the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen realized that he had underestimated the amount of Essence Energy needed by the Immortal Culling Sword. Half of the solid Essence Energy Crystals that had been accumulated in the Chaos Egg were instantly sucked away by the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Chaos Egg was getting closer and closer to the metal flower. The vibrations it suffered also became stronger and stronger. The Essence Energy it converted also increased significantly, preventing the Essence Energy in the Chaos Egg from drying up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s current situation was like the act of boiling water.</p>
<p>The metal flower’s vibrational force was like fire, and the Chaos Egg was a pot that boiled water. If the fire was too intense, the pot would melt, but because there was water in the pot, it wouldn’t break down before the water dried up.</p>
<p>Now, the Immortal Culling Sword played the role of water. The pressure the metal flower gave the Chaos Egg transformed into Essence Energy and was absorbed by the Immortal Culling Sword. Before the Immortal Culling Sword was fully absorbed, the Chaos Egg wouldn’t be damaged.</p>
<p>Although the Chaos Egg wasn’t damaged, it didn’t mean that the its strength could really withstand the metal flower. When the woman’s throw lost all its momentum, the Chaos Egg was immediately repelled by the vibrational force. It charged even faster in the woman’s direction.</p>
<p>The woman originally wanted to exploit the Chaos Egg’s disturbance of the metal flower to escape, but she realized that in this strange domain, her body seemed to resonate with the vibrations. Once she attempted to leave this area, her body’s frequency was different from the outside world. She was repelled by the Universe’s natural frequency. Even if she didn’t die, she would be severely injured.</p>
<p>Seeing the Chaos Egg bounce back, the woman’s palm erupted with Holy Light. She struck the Chaos Egg and smashed it back.</p>
<p>The solid Essence Energy in the Chaos Egg quickly depleted, but the Immortal Culling Sword hadn’t been pulled out. It was still crazily absorbing his Essence Energy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was originally grumbling inwardly. He never expected the Essence Energy converted from a Calamity-grade power to be insufficient. To pull out the sword, he probably would have to come up with a way to activate the Sigh of the King.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, when the woman’s strength struck the Chaos Egg, it immediately transformed into a large amount of solid Essence Energy. It could last a while longer.</p>
<p>As for the Chaos Egg, it was struck by the force and flew towards the metal flower like a comet. During the process, it was affected by the vibrations, producing large amounts of solid Essence Energy as well.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg was sandwiched between the two Calamity-grade creatures and was constantly attacked by both powers. It allowed Zhou Wen to obtain enough Essence Energy to barely satisfy the Immortal Culling Sword’s needs.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was most worried that they would suddenly stop fighting or not hit his Chaos Egg. Then, the Immortal Culling Sword would suck him dry.</p>
<p>Thankfully, what Zhou Wen was worried about didn’t happen. The woman didn’t seem convinced that her strength was insufficient to shatter the strange ball. She struck the Chaos Egg even harder, hoping to blast it apart.</p>
<p>He was a mere human—at most at the Terror grade. The woman refused to believe that her strength couldn’t break through the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Even if she couldn’t affect the metal flower, she had to kill this detestable human first.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg was like a ping pong ball as it bounced between the woman and the metal flower.</p>
<p>The humans who were paying attention to this battle were trying their best to figure out what kind of creatures were on both sides of the battle. However, the interference from the forces there was just too strong. Apart from the burst of light, they couldn’t see anything else through the satellites.</p>
<p>“Could such a holy power be the descent of the Holy Son or Holy Mother?” Someone in the West District guessed.</p>
<p>In the terrifying holy light, some Terror-grade experts could vaguely see angels formed by the holy light.</p>
<p>“It’s also possible that a powerful angel has descended. Could it be the legendary archangel, Michael?”</p>
<p>“Probably not. Do you still remember? Among the dimensional creatures that went to Venus previously, there was a black-winged angel. Perhaps one of the personnel involved in the battle is him.”</p>
<p>“That black-winged angel looks like a fallen angel no matter how you look at it. It shouldn’t have such holy powers, right?”</p>
<p>“Who said that fallen angels can’t have holy powers? Doesn’t the legendary Lucifer have holy powers?”</p>
<p>As everyone discussed, they suddenly saw Holy Light erupt like a volcano in the projection’s battlefield, illuminating the entire battlefield.</p>
<p>And in the light, one could vaguely see the shadow of a six-winged seraphim. The face and form of the shadow was very similar to that woman.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1274'>Chapter 1274: Six-Winged Seraphim</h3>
<p>“Heavens… That’s Seraph…”</p>
<p>“The Burning One!”</p>
<p>“This world is really about to undergo a huge change. Even Seraph has appeared!”</p>
<p>Many believers who saw this scene began praying to the six-winged seraphim.</p>
<p>The six-winged seraphim represented the head of angels in the Old Testament. All believers were proud to see seraphim.</p>
<p>“The emergence of Seraph and showing his holiness marks the moment for our Church to save the world again,” an archbishop cried in excitement.</p>
<p>This was an era of collapsed faith. All sorts of immortals, saints, and devils had been slaughtered. Humanity’s religious faith turned more and more indifferent, and the number of devotees had decreased.</p>
<p>However, there were still many pious believers who believed that their true god definitely existed.</p>
<p>Now that the six-winged seraphim had appeared, many pious believers believed that the true angel had descended. Their true god was about to save them.</p>
<p>The upper echelons of the various factions had different expressions when they saw the angel’s figure. Some were happy, while others were sad.</p>
<p>The people of the West District naturally believed that it was a powerful existence that belonged to their region. If it really descended, it might bring good changes to the West District.</p>
<p>However, even the bigwigs of the Cape family and the Family Clan of Gods were not happy at all.</p>
<p>Their thoughts were completely different from ordinary people. Even if there were powerful existences in their own districts, as long as they weren’t under their control, they were only a threat.</p>
<p>Who cared about angels or demons? In this era, they no longer believed in such things.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan happened to be a guest at the Zhang family’s residence. When he saw this scene, he asked Zhang Chunqiu, “Make a guess. Is the creature in the battle really the legendary Seraph of the West District?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. After all, it’s not something from our district. I don’t know much about it,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan curled his lips and continued, “According to what I know, in the West District’s Old Testament, the Seraph described should have four or two heads. This looks too normal. Furthermore, if it’s just a shadow, I wonder if it’s really Seraph. Perhaps it’s just the effects of the lighting.”</p>
<p>“It’s not lighting effects. It should be the manifestation of a Calamity-grade power.” Zhang Chunqiu paused for a moment before saying, “If such power appears on Earth, it will be a miracle. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that a true god has descended.”</p>
<p>However, Xia Liuchuan said, “Actually, I want to know who her opponent is. Regardless of whether she’s really Seraph or not, to be able to fight her to such an extent without seeing the full display of strength, her opponent might be stronger.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps.” Zhang Chunqiu wasn’t as curious as Xia Liuchuan. He only hoped that a battle of this level wouldn’t appear on Earth. Otherwise, it would be a disaster for humanity.</p>
<p>Originally, only a few people could see this battle, but due to the archbishop’s excitement and eagerness to spread this miracle, he broadcast the scene transmitted by satellite. It immediately attracted many people from the Federation and overseas.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, what’s that? Seraph?”</p>
<p>“That’s Venus, right? Seraph is fighting on Venus? Who is she fighting?”</p>
<p>“Why is this outside Venus? Shouldn’t she be challenging the Venusian dimensional zone?”</p>
<p>More and more people joined in the spectacle. Through word of mouth, many people knew that Seraph had appeared. Many fanatical believers immediately got onto the Internet to watch the livestream. Some even prostrated themselves before the angel.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t think there was anything to worship. He knew better than anyone how vicious that woman was. Zhou Wen wished he could kill her with one strike, much less worship her.</p>
<p>However, the Immortal Culling Sword hadn’t absorbed enough Essence Energy. It still hadn’t been pulled out.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s pleasant surprise, the power that the woman erupted with suddenly increased significantly, causing the solid Essence Energy in the Chaos Egg to rapidly condense. Instantly, it caught up to the absorption speed of the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>This woman is strong! Zhou Wen originally imagined that the woman had already displayed her strongest combat strength, but he never expected her to suddenly unleash her full power.</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn’t that the woman didn’t want to unleash her power earlier, but if she used this power, it would result in serious consequences for her. Unless it was absolutely necessary, she didn’t want to use it.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, the woman wouldn’t have used such power.</p>
<p>Even if she couldn’t kill the metal flower, the metal flower wouldn’t be able to defeat her. At the end of the day, both parties would have their strength depleted. When the Calamity Zone’s strength was weakened, she would be able to rush out.</p>
<p>What she couldn’t tolerate was that she couldn’t even deal with a mere human. He was clearly a weak fellow, but she had no idea what the ball he had condensed was. Despite hitting it so many times, it didn’t break. She couldn’t tolerate letting Zhou Wen off.</p>
<p>Even if she had to make some sacrifices, she had to break the Chaos Egg and kill the detestable Zhou Wen on the spot to restore her calm.</p>
<p>At that moment, the woman had six angelic wings spread out from her back. An angelic halo appeared above her head as her entire body spewed out Holy Light that was as hot as flames.</p>
<p>Holy Light filled the entire battlefield, forming the silhouette of the six-winged seraphim. Even the metal flower’s vibrational domain was suppressed.</p>
<p>It would be very easy for the woman to leave the battlefield now, but she no longer wanted to leave.</p>
<p>Anyone would feel terrible if they couldn’t vent the frustration after paying a huge price for the massive strength. It was the same for the woman.</p>
<p>She stared coldly at the Chaos Egg that had bounced back. She clenched her hand as blazing Holy Light condensed into a flaming sword.</p>
<p>The Holy Light over the Blazing Flame Sword was thousands of times stronger than the Holy Light over her body. It slashed at the Chaos Egg and a sword beam that seemed to split the heavens and earth apart slashed down, splitting open the metal flower’s Calamity Zone and slashing at the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed when he saw this. He was somewhat worried if the Chaos Egg could withstand such a terrifying force, but at this point, he could only take a gamble.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The people watching the live broadcast saw the six-winged seraphim emit a sword-like Holy Light. The Holy Light split the ground, forming a long ditch that spanned hundreds of kilometers. It was like the Sword of Judgment of the Apocalypse.</p>
<p>As the metal flower’s Calamity Zone was slashed open, they finally saw the situation inside.</p>
<p>The rift that had been slashed open by the Holy Light stretched on endlessly while the six-winged seraphim floated in the air. In the rift was a huge tower-like pillar. Atop the pillar was a metal flower.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, the creature fighting Seraph is actually a flower. What’s the origin of that flower? It can actually fight a six-winged seraphim?”</p>
<p>“Unbelievable. A plant-type dimensional creature has such powerful combat strength?”</p>
<p>“A plant that can fight Seraph?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1275'>Chapter 1275: That Sword Looks Familiar</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Seeing that the one fighting Seraph was a metal flower, even Cave Era and company in the League of Guardians were very surprised.</p>
<p>“Plant-type dimensional creatures have always been relatively weak. Even if they have some kind of ability, they can only be effective in certain areas. This plant on Venus can actually fight the six-winged seraphim. I wonder what kind of origin it has,” Blood Shaman said.</p>
<p>Hermit stared at the flower for a while before saying emotionally, “That flower looks like the legendary Withered Flower.”</p>
<p>“What’s Withered Flower?” Blood Shaman asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Cave Era looked at the metal flower on the projection and said, “Legend has it that every Withered Flower represents a single life. At the end of that life, the Withered Flower will wither. Therefore, the Withered Flower is actually the Flower of Life. It can control life and death. However, the Withered Flower should be of natural origins. This metal body doesn’t seem right.”</p>
<p>Hermit thought for a moment and said, “There is indeed something amiss, but it really looks like a Withered Flower.”</p>
<p>Immortal, who was sitting on the seat of honor, finally spoke. When he spoke, everyone fell silent. Even people like Blood Shaman and Cave Era didn’t dare make a sound, afraid that they would interrupt him.</p>
<p>“That’s the legendary Withered Flower. However, it’s not a normal Withered Flower. If I’m not wrong, someone must have brought the seed of the Withered Flower from Earth to Venus, allowing it to absorb the metallic elements of Venus and grow. It mutated, resulting in such a strange Withered Flower,” Immortal said slowly.</p>
<p>“Who has the ability to not only find a Withered Flower, but also bring it to Venus and let it grow in such an environment without dying?” Hermit found it an insurmountable task.</p>
<p>“Who knows? However, he must be an extremely interesting person,” Immortal said with piqued interest.</p>
<p>At that moment, the metal flower began to show its might. From the tower-like pillar, flower roots extended out.</p>
<p>Although the flower was tiny and could be held with one hand, its roots were unimaginably huge. They were like dragons as they tore through the rocks and drilled out from the ground, causing the ground to crack. The rocks flipped open as the mountain range constantly trembled like a magnitude 12 earthquake.</p>
<p>Flower roots extended out and covered an area of hundreds of kilometers. Some of them curled towards the mountains and uprooted them.</p>
<p>Rumble! Rumble!</p>
<p>The mountain peaks shattered as though an invisible force had blasted all the mountain peaks and rocks into tiny particles. Wherever the flower roots passed, the entire space trembled violently.</p>
<p>It wasn’t an earthquake, but space in its entirety was trembling.</p>
<p>Everyone was dumbfounded. They had never seen such a ferocious plant before. It was like an interstellar monster. Just a random root from it could shatter a mountain. What terrifying strength was this?</p>
<p>Now, many people were secretly glad that this battle hadn’t happened on Earth. Otherwise, many humans would definitely be implicated.</p>
<p>Just as everyone was shocked by the metal flower’s terrifying strength, the woman attacked again. The Blazing Flame Sword in her hand slashed down again.</p>
<p>However, her target this time wasn’t the Chaos Egg, but the metal flower.</p>
<p>The metal flower also sensed the danger. The flower roots swept towards the Blazing Flame Sword like metal monsters, attempting to block it.</p>
<p>However, when the Blazing Flame Sword slashed at the flower roots, it was like slicing through tofu as it sliced through the terrifying dragon-like flower roots.</p>
<p>Any flower roots that touched the Blazing Flame Sword melted instantly, turning into liquid metal that fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The stone pillar, which was already more than a thousand meters tall and resembled a giant tower, was split in half by the Blazing Flame Sword and collapsed to both sides.</p>
<p>The leaves beside the metal flower were chopped off. Almost all the roots below were severed and burned.</p>
<p>“Her Excellency Seraph is invincible!”</p>
<p>“This is a true angel, an omnipotent Emissary of God.”</p>
<p>“She killed such a terrifying monster with one strike. As expected of the strongest Seraph!”</p>
<p>People exclaimed in amazement and marveled at the strength of the six-winged seraphim. Many believers treated the woman as a true seraph.</p>
<p>At that moment, at the end of the chasm, a person walked out of the rubble. He held the hilt of his sword in one hand and the scabbard in the other. His aura was almost nonexistent.</p>
<p>Just now, the Chaos Egg had been cleaved by the strike and slammed hundreds of kilometers away. This chasm was created by the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was originally worried that the Chaos Egg wouldn’t be able to withstand the powerful impact and would be sliced apart. Even he wouldn’t be spared.</p>
<p>In fact, the Chaos Egg was ultimately destroyed. Thankfully, the remaining force was blocked by the Prisoned Dragon armor with Absolute Defense.</p>
<p>However, before it shattered, the Chaos Egg had already converted a massive amount of solid Essence Energy to supplement the Immortal Culling Sword’s needs.</p>
<p>Even so, the Immortal Culling Sword didn’t immediately stop after absorbing all the Essence Energy in Zhou Wen’s body. It only truly stopped when it was done.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been in for a shock with Slaughterer about to be drained. Thankfully, the Immortal Culling Sword was finally satisfied and stopped devouring his Essence Energy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wore the Prisoned Dragon armor and held the Immortal Culling Sword as he walked towards the woman.</p>
<p>Just as people were exclaiming the strength of the seraphim, they suddenly realized that the figure had turned its head and was looking in a direction as though it was staring at something.</p>
<p>“Is there something over there?” People were somewhat puzzled, but they didn’t find anything suspicious on the projection. There were snapped roots and shattered rocks everywhere.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>At the bureau, Wei Ge’s heart stirred as he instructed, “Old Xu, adjust the satellite angle and see if you can see the end of the chasm.”</p>
<p>Old Xu immediately adjusted the data. Soon, the scene changed. After swiveling a few times, they suddenly saw a figure walking in the chasm.</p>
<p>“Zoom in.” Wei Ge’s eyes focused as he ordered again.</p>
<p>Old Xu and the staff did the adjustments again. The scene gradually magnified and became clearer.</p>
<p>“That’s a person… The sword in his hand looks familiar… Human Sovereign…” After Old Xu saw the scene, he immediately jumped up from his chair and pointed at the screen without closing his mouth.</p>
<p>“Interesting.” Wei Ge narrowed his eyes in thought. Moments later, Wei Ge gave another order. “Send the signal to the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau. Aren’t they livestreaming? Contact them and get them to use our signal source.”</p>
<p>Although they were puzzled as to why Wei Ge was doing this, Wei Ge’s words were like an imperial edict in the bureau. No one dared to question him. Old Xu immediately contacted the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau.</p>
<p>When the editor-in-chief of the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau saw the signal that Old Xu had sent over, he also jumped up from his chair.. His fat body had never been so agile. He stood on the chair and pointed at the screen for a long time before saying, “Holy sh*t… Human Sovereign…”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1276'>Chapter 1276: Killing an Angel with a Sword</h3>
<p>After the slaying of Di Tian, there was probably no one among the humans who didn’t recognize the Immortal Culling Sword, even though many people in the Federation were selling replicas.</p>
<p>However, for a human to dare enter a Calamity-grade battlefield on Venus with such a sword, the possibility of him being Human Sovereign was undoubtedly very high.</p>
<p>“Oh my goodness, Boss, is this really Human Sovereign?” The staff by the side became excited.</p>
<p>“The possibility is very high. To be able to appear in a place like Venus, and for the signal to come from the bureau… Immediately switch the signal source… By the way… Be more careful… Use the word ‘suspected’ in the press release later…”</p>
<p>The news media outlet, the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau, soon started operating at full speed. Not long after, the people who were watching the other media outlets turned to the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau because they heard a particular name.</p>
<p>“F*ck… Is this really Human Sovereign?”</p>
<p>“That sword looks like it.”</p>
<p>“To be able to go to a place like Venus and even dare to enter a Calamity-grade battlefield, I really can’t think of anyone other than the Human Sovereign.”</p>
<p>“Oh my god, Human Sovereign has finally appeared again. It’s been five years. He’s finally back.”</p>
<p>“What’s Human Sovereign doing there? It looks like he’s walking towards Seraph!”</p>
<p>“No way… Could it be…”</p>
<p>“No…” The angels’ believers felt mixed emotions to the extreme.</p>
<p>Human Sovereign was the spiritual pillar of humanity, but angels were also their faith and spiritual pillar. They were unwilling to see the scene that they were guessing was about to happen.</p>
<p>However, what would come, would come. Everyone could tell that Human Sovereign was walking towards the seraph, and the seraph was also staring at Human Sovereign.</p>
<p>“This fellow hasn’t done anything in the past few years, but the moment he appears, he causes such a huge commotion. Does he like to be in the limelight that much?” Xia Liuchuan said with a strange expression.</p>
<p>“Does he need to rely on causing commotions to be in the limelight?” Zhang Chunqiu shook his head.</p>
<p>“That’s true…” Xia Liuchuan thought for a long time and said helplessly.</p>
<p>If Human Sovereign really wanted to be in the limelight, he didn’t need to do anything.</p>
<p>“What is he trying to do?” In the League of Guardians, Cave Era, Hermit, and company had mixed expressions. They were both respectful and afraid of Human Sovereign.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of humans, they believed that Human Sovereign had indeed fought for humanity, preserving humanity’s last dignity in the face of the dimension’s creatures.</p>
<p>However, they were now in the League of Guardians and were working for the dimension. Without a doubt, they were at odds with Human Sovereign.</p>
<p>Immortal just sat there and watched. He didn’t show any expression, nor did the look in his eyes change. It was unknown what he was thinking.</p>
<p>“That fellow finally can’t stand the loneliness.” In the president’s office of the Holy Spirit Association, Zhong Ziya was wearing a white bathrobe and hugging a sword. He was leaning diagonally against the window with a glass of wine in his hand. He was watching the live broadcast.</p>
<p>The number of viewers watching the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau stream increased exponentially. Out of the people who could go online, more than 70% of them were watching their live broadcast. The words ‘Human Sovereign’ were just too attractive.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know that many people were watching him. Even if he knew, he wouldn’t take it to heart. All he wanted to do now was see if the Immortal Culling Sword could slay the woman and end this scourge.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen’s only worry was that the woman would run away when she saw the Immortal Culling Sword in his hand. After all, many people had seen the Immortal Culling Sword and knew how powerful it was.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was clearly overthinking things. The woman didn’t know about the Immortal Culling Sword due to her long tenure in the Present Hut. She didn’t know about the battle with Di Tian, so she naturally didn’t know how powerful it was.</p>
<p>The woman frowned slightly when she saw Zhou Wen alive. She immediately raised her Blazing Flame Sword and slashed at Zhou Wen who was walking out of the chasm.</p>
<p>Being in her six-winged seraphim state was just too draining on her. She had to resolve the problem as soon as possible, or the consequences would be dire. All she wanted to do now was kill Zhou Wen as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In the corner of the woman’s eyes, there were already some fine patterns that made her look at least ten years older than before. This was already a sign that something was wrong with her body.</p>
<p>This strike was even more terrifying than the previous two strikes. The six-winged seraphim’s strength continued to increase with time.</p>
<p>The sword beam shot down from the heavens as though it wanted to split apart the cosmos. It was a spectacle when it slashed down—as though even Venus would be split into two by this strike.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Those who cared about Human Sovereign couldn’t help but worry when they saw such a terrifying attack.</p>
<p>Some of the more timid women didn’t even dare watch further. They turned their heads and waited nervously for the outcome.</p>
<p>“Human Sovereign is still human after all. He shouldn’t be enemies with Seraph. That’s a true Apostle of God…” the archbishop muttered to himself.</p>
<p>Most believers ultimately felt that their faith was more important and more powerful.</p>
<p>Ordinary eyes were unable to keep up with the sword beam’s speed. All they could see was the terrifying sword beam cleaving into the ground like it was chopping at a watermelon. The entire world seemed to be illuminated by the sword beam’s radiance, making it impossible to see anything.</p>
<p>Hum!</p>
<p>A sword hum resounded through the universe as a black rift opened in the world that was almost occupied by the sword beam.</p>
<p>The crack streaked across the sky like a straight black line on white paper.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The white paper split open from top to bottom as the sword beam disintegrated. Everyone’s vision returned to normal.</p>
<p>Human Sovereign was still standing in his spot. His hand was still holding the hilt of his saber as though he had never moved.</p>
<p>As for the six-winged seraphim projection in the sky, it remained motionless as though it had never moved.</p>
<p>Just as people were wondering what was going on, they suddenly saw the angel’s projection shatter like glass. A figure fell out. It was a woman with six wings and a halo above her head like an angel.</p>
<p>However, at that moment, she didn’t look like a noble angel. Her body was covered in blood, and four of the angel wings on her back had been sliced off. Her body had also been sliced in two as she plummeted deep into the rift.</p>
<p>“Impossible…” The archbishop was dumbfounded, almost unable to believe what he had seen.</p>
<p>The believers who had been holding on to their beliefs felt something in their hearts collapse. They were rendered speechless as they stared blankly at the live broadcast.</p>
<p>“Human Sovereign is invincible… Even Seraph was killed in one strike… He’s so powerful…”</p>
<p>“Haha, so what if it’s angels or demons? They are inferior to Human Sovereign’s sword.”</p>
<p>“Your Excellency Human Sovereign, why not clear the Venusian instance dungeon while you’re at it? Only you are worthy of first place.”</p>
<p>Everyone was overjoyed. Although most people didn’t even have the ability to fight, they could rejoice in the victory because of Human Sovereign.</p>
<p>In the League of Guardians, Hermit and company wore ugly expressions as they subconsciously touched their waists. They were very worried that the next time Human Sovereign’s sword slashed, it would be at their waists.</p>
<p>Many would be fated to suffer from insomnia tonight.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1277'>Chapter 1277: Reappearance of the Dead Man Tree</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen felt his body emptied. Despite having so much external power supplementing him, using the Immortal Culling Sword still placed quite an immense burden on him.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it only weakened him a little—a lot better than previously. It didn’t injure his body and didn’t pose much of a hindrance. With the circulation of the Dao Sutra, Essence Energy surged endlessly and he recovered significantly.</p>
<p>He flew into the rift with the Immortal Culling Sword in hand. Although it was unlikely that a creature that had been slashed by the Immortal Culling Sword would survive, Zhou Wen still wanted to confirm it with his own eyes. It was best if he could deliver another strike or two to nip the possibility of the woman’s survival.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen flew down the rift and saw the woman’s severed body. She had lost her life.</p>
<p>The reason why the Immortal Culling Sword was terrifying wasn’t just because it was powerful. The creatures it killed had a very low chance of survival even if they had powerful self-healing or revival abilities.</p>
<p>Otherwise, how could it cull immortals? Those immortals had the Art of Longevity, so self-healing wasn’t difficult for them.</p>
<p>However, to Zhou Wen’s surprise, although there was zero vitality in the woman’s body, her head continued emitting life force. Her soul hadn’t been wiped away by the Immortal Culling Sword’s power.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen clearly saw the woman’s eyes widen. On her forehead was a tiny red lipstick mark.</p>
<p>The lipstick mark was very cute. It should have come from a child and not an adult. At that moment, the lipstick mark shimmered with a strange glow. It actually resisted the power of the Immortal Culling Sword, allowing the woman to cling on to survival.</p>
<p>Her body had already begun to decay, but her head remained alive. Her head flew up in a bid to escape.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, with only her head left, she was clearly no longer as powerful as a Calamity-grade existence. Her speed was even slower. With Transcendent Flying Immortal, Zhou Wen slashed at the woman’s head with his sheathed Immortal Culling Sword, slashing it to the ground.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the unsheathed Immortal Slaying Sword was only equivalent to a hard metal pole. Zhou Wen’s full-powered strike failed to shatter the woman’s head.</p>
<p>The head landed on the ground, shattering a large area of the rocky ground and sinking into the rocks.</p>
<p>Due to Zhou Wen’s strike, the lipstick mark on her forehead became incomplete. The light on it gradually dimmed as her head’s life force weakened. The flesh on her neck had already begun to decay.</p>
<p>What’s the origin of that lipstick mark? It can actually withstand the power of the Immortal Culling Sword? Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised, but now wasn’t the time to think about that. He wanted the woman completely dead to prevent any future trouble.</p>
<p>The woman seemed to know that she was doomed. She shouted at Zhou Wen sternly, “No matter who you are, no matter where you are, you are doomed. No matter where you hide—be it the sky, the ground, or the endless universe—Mistress will avenge me and smite you down to endless hell, never to reincarnate… Lowly human… You will soon know… What true horror means…”</p>
<p>Following the woman’s sharp cry, a strong holy light suddenly erupted from her head and exploded. The shockwave instantly obliterated everything around her.</p>
<p>The intense light made the image transmitted by the satellite turn white—nothing could be seen. The light continued without any reduction, as though it was eternal holy brilliance.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen instant transmitted away and wasn’t affected by the self-destruction. Although he was still enveloped by the light, the power of the light couldn’t injure the Prisoned Dragon armor at such a distance.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. With the woman’s strength, she was an extremely powerful existence even in the dimension.</p>
<p>However, from her tone, she was only a slave. Then, how powerful was her mistress?</p>
<p>Apocalypse level? Zhou Wen guessed inwardly. But so what if it’s at the Apocalypse level? The Apocalypse powerhouses of the dimension wouldn’t dare enter Earth personally.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought of the metal flower and instant transmitted nearby, hoping to see if it was completely dead. If it wasn’t completely dead, he could take the opportunity to deliver the killing blow. Perhaps a dimensional crystal would drop.</p>
<p>It would be awesome if a Companion Egg dropped. He still didn’t have a Calamity-grade Companion Beast.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the flower, he saw that the metal flower’s roots were almost completely severed. Its leaves had also been chopped off, leaving only its stem and flower on the ground. The metallic luster had become very faint. It didn’t look like it would survive.</p>
<p>Seeing the metal flower in such a state, he didn’t even need to deliver the killing blow. Just as he was about to pick up a petal to see if it was of any use, he suddenly felt the mysterious phone vibrate as though it wanted to come out.</p>
<p>Could it be… Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he scanned the area with his consciousness. He didn’t discover any other creatures nearby, and due to the holy brilliance’s existence, he couldn’t see anything beyond. He took out his phone and took a look. Indeed, the Dead Man Tree automatically appeared and took a shot of the metal flower.</p>
<p>The metal flower’s corpse and countless roots instantly vanished. An additional flower bud appeared on the Dead Man Tree.</p>
<p>Strange, hasn’t the Dead Man Tree always absorbed special humans? Why would it absorb this metal flower? Zhou Wen felt increasingly puzzled.</p>
<p>However, it was ultimately a good thing. Without staying any longer, Zhou Wen teleported back to Earth.</p>
<p>The people watching the livestream had only seen a blazing white color all this while. The Venusian temperatures were already very high, but the temperature on the battlefield was even higher. The blazing white color made it appear like a huge white lake of holy flames. It burned without end and would continue for decades without extinguishing.</p>
<p>From space, it looked like a glowing white eye. People in the future called the lake of holy flames on Venus the Eye of Human Sovereign to commemorate the battle.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>At the instant the woman’s head exploded, the red lipstick mark vanished as a stream of light.</p>
<p>In an ancient castle somewhere in the universe, a blonde girl was lying in a crystal coffin. She was wearing white dress-type pajamas and her face was ruddy. She looked like she was sleeping.</p>
<p>Suddenly, red lips appeared on the crystal coffin’s lid. The girl was jolted awake. When she saw the red lipstick mark on the crystal coffin lid, her eyes immediately revealed a sad expression.</p>
<p>“Yana’s dead?” The girl pushed away the crystal coffin lid. The red lipstick mark automatically flew in and landed on her lips. The girl bit her lip as her eyes gradually became firm, as though she had made a major decision.</p>
<p>A giant, who was more than ten meters tall and wearing a servant uniform, came in front of the crystal coffin and knelt down. His face approached the crystal coffin as he asked softly, “Mistress, why are you up?”</p>
<p>“Yana’s dead,” the little girl said sadly.</p>
<p>“Which Yana? Oh, I remember now. It’s that dishonest maidservant. She’s already been exiled.. So what if she’s dead? It’s not worth your concern, Mistress,” the giant manservant said indifferently.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1278'>Chapter 1278: Absolute Space</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“But Yana is my friend,” the little girl said.</p>
<p>The servant giant immediately said, “Mistress, Yana is only a lowly creature in the Ancient Forbidden Land. What right does she have to be your friend? When you were out touring the Ancient Forbidden Land, you made her your maid. It was already a great blessing for her to be by your side and serve you. Yet, she was disrespectful towards you and had the nerve to become your friend. She even stole your things. She deserves death.”</p>
<p>“But…” The little girl’s mouth moved, wanting to say something, but in the end, she didn’t say anything. She hugged a panda doll that was about her height and lay down again. After closing her eyes, she said, “Little Chrysanthemum, I’m tired and need some rest. You may take your leave.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Mistress.” The servant giant carefully closed the coffin lid again before carefully leaving the room, as though he was afraid of disturbing the girl’s rest.</p>
<p>After the giant left, the girl opened her eyes again and blinked. She secretly opened the crystal coffin lid and crawled out.</p>
<p>After taking a few steps, she seemed to think of something. She looked back at the empty crystal coffin and the panda doll in her arms. Finally, she reluctantly placed the panda doll into the crystal coffin.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to worry. I’ll be back as soon as I resolve Yana’s matter,” the girl said as she reached out and kissed the panda’s forehead. A petite and cute lipstick mark was left on it.</p>
<p>Instantly, the panda doll took on the little girl’s looks and lay peacefully in the crystal coffin.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>People originally imagined that Human Sovereign would attempt the Venusian dimensional zone and obtain first place, but this didn’t happen. Human Sovereign vanished after slaying the six-winged seraphim.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t lucky on his return to Earth. He arrived at a desolate swamp with many dimensional zones around him. He was contemplating a route back to a human city. At the very least, he had to go to a place with a network signal to know if there were any creatures challenging the Venusian dimensional zone again.</p>
<p>However, before Zhou Wen could return to human territory, a creature had already entered the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>The person who entered the Venusian dimensional zone this time was the previously-seen black-winged seraphim. He wasn’t as noble as Yana, nor was he as holy.</p>
<p>His black wings had a few white feathers in them. He wasn’t wearing any armor, but he was wearing a robe that didn’t look very clean. It was similar to priest robes.</p>
<p>The Cube lit up. When people saw that it wasn’t Human Sovereign who had entered the dimensional zone, they couldn’t help but be disappointed.</p>
<p>However, what happened next shocked everyone.</p>
<p>The black-winged seraphim held a black leather-bound book. After entering the Venusian dimensional zone, he didn’t even look up when facing the bullets shot out by the Metal Guard. All he did was calmly flip open the black leather-bound book.</p>
<p>It was completely uneventful. People only saw him flip through the book. No one saw what happened next. The Metal Guard and his bullet vanished.</p>
<p>This kept repeating. The Metal Guards, Golden Battle Gods, came out one after another and then mysteriously vanished.</p>
<p>Finally, the Calamity bullet shot out. People only saw the black-winged seraphim flip open the book—they didn’t see how the black-winged seraphim entered the maze and how he arrived in front of the Golden Palace. But they found him standing there eventually.</p>
<p>The Cube showed the rankings again. The words ‘The Fallen’ appeared in second place. Behind The Fallen were four golden stars.</p>
<p>“Professor Gu, what do you think of the newly-appeared Fallen?” Everyone in the Federation was discussing The Fallen. The Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau was naturally doing programs regarding The Fallen.</p>
<p>Professor Gu said, “The situation now is relatively clear. Only creatures that have reached the Golden Palace can enter the rankings. Up to now, a total of two have been on the rankings. The first is Tsukuyomi. There are five stars behind her. The second is The Fallen. There are four stars behind him, so he’s second while Tsukuyomi is first. The number of stars should determine the rankings.”</p>
<p>“Many people believe that from the performance of the dimensional zones, Tsukuyomi is weaker than The Fallen, but her ranking is higher than The Fallen. What do you think about this?” the host asked again.</p>
<p>“Superficially, it’s indeed true that The Fallen appears to be stronger and more mysterious. Furthermore, Tsukuyomi reached the Golden Palace with the help of Looter King. However, this doesn’t mean that The Fallen is really stronger than Tsukuyomi. The Fallen’s abilities are still presently unknown. It’s difficult to determine what happened after he opened the black leather-bound book. It’s still difficult to make conclusions,” Professor Gu said ambiguously.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen returned to inhabited areas, he learned about The Fallen. However, there was clearly nothing to pick up this time. It was useless even if he returned early.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued grinding in-game. He grinded the Venusian instance dungeon once a day, hoping to find a way to clear it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen even tried using the Prisoned Dragon armor to block the Calamity-grade bullets and really managed to block them. Although the armor was riddled with bullet holes and dents, the bullets failed to penetrate.</p>
<p>Of course, this was only referring to the first six bullets. The seventh bullet blasted open the blood-colored avatar’s head. Even Absolute Defense failed to withstand it.</p>
<p>It’s already quite impressive to be able to withstand the first six Calamity-grade bullets. From the looks of it, I need to think of another way to deal with the seventh bullet. Zhou Wen took out the Spacetime Piglet Crystal he had obtained from the Chaos Hut.</p>
<p>I hope it’s a spatial extension skill. Zhou Wen absorbed it. It was a Mythical crystal of a spatial type, so Zhou Wen easily met the absorption requirement.</p>
<p>Seeing the Spacetime Piglet Crystal fuse into his body and open up a new Essence Energy circulation, Zhou Wen vaguely felt that his wish had come true.</p>
<p>Absolute Space: Mythical</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen carefully studied it, he realized that it was indeed similar to spatial extension, but it was still somewhat different.</p>
<p>This ability couldn’t really extend space. It could only create a special space—Absolute Space.</p>
<p>In Absolute Space, space could be changed. Absolute Space was like a spatial map. It was to scale with reality.</p>
<p>What appeared only a meter long in reality still looked like a meter in Absolute Space, but in fact, this space had already become a thousand meters.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen still wasn’t capable of such a feat. He had just learned Absolute Space and could only reach a ratio of 1:10. Furthermore, the Absolute Space he could create was only the size of a chicken egg.</p>
<p>Even if the space inside such a tiny space is ten times bigger than in reality, it’s impossible for it to withstand the Calamity-grade bullet. Zhou Wen knew that he had to raise Absolute Space to the Terror grade to even have an iota of hope.</p>
<p>It was still hope nonetheless, so Zhou Wen began practicing.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1279'>Chapter 1279: Isn’t the Terror-grade Enough?</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>As he had already cultivated two spatial-type Essence Energy Arts, Zhou Wen was rather familiar with spatial powers. It could even be said that he was adept in it.</p>
<p>Although he had never come into contact with Absolute Space before, Zhou Wen was quickly able to master it after understanding its circulation method. Furthermore, he rapidly improved.</p>
<p>In just a day, Absolute Space that was originally the size of a chicken egg had already reached the size of a cubic meter. Furthermore, the space inside had already reached hundreds of times the size of the outside world.</p>
<p>What looked like a distance of a meter was in fact, entering a space a few hundred meters across. A corporeal object had to travel the same distance in Absolute Space.</p>
<p>A few hundred meters was enough to fight ordinary opponents, but to fight a Calamity-grade expert, that was still lacking.</p>
<p>To the speed of light, a few hundred meters wasn’t much different from a few thousand meters. Zhou Wen had to think of a way to extend Absolute Space even further to slow the Calamity-grade’s attack by a tiny bit so that he could dodge it.</p>
<p>In the next few days, Zhou Wen constantly pondered over how to make Absolute Space stronger. However, when the ratio between Absolute Space and an actual distance reached about a thousand, he was unable to improve further.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that he had reached a bottleneck. The bottleneck of a divine skill had to exceed the Mythical stage in order to continue growing and strengthen Absolute Space.</p>
<p>Li Xuan had nothing better to do, so he came to chat with Zhou Wen. Seeing Zhou Wen’s worried frown, he asked curiously, “I seldom see such an expression on your face. What happened?”</p>
<p>“I’m thinking about how to raise a skill’s level and make it stronger,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“That’s very easy. Just train more and think more.” As Li Xuan spoke, he asked, “What skill do you want to raise? What level is the skill originally at? Tell me and I’ll help you think of a solution.”</p>
<p>“Spatial-type. It’s now at the Mythical stage,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“It’s indeed very difficult to advance a Mythical skill. Furthermore, it’s a spatial-type that’s very difficult to begin with. It’s no wonder you are fretting. In that case, I have a solution. Go to dimensional zones with spatial creatures and fight them. Experience their spatial powers more and you might be able to gain some insight and break through to the Terror grade.” Li Xuan shared his experience. He had been constantly fighting, getting beaten, and being tortured for the past five years, allowing him to have his present achievements.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sighed and said, “It’s not difficult to advance to the Terror grade. It will only take two more days, but I’m afraid that a Terror-grade skill won’t meet my requirements. It will be difficult to advance further.”</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s face darkened as he said gloomily, “Is this how you chat? Even a Terror-grade skill isn’t enough for you? Why don’t you just drop dead!”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing I can do about it. If I want to clear the Venusian dimensional zone, I have to master this skill,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You want to use this spatial skill to dodge the Calamity-grade bullet?” Li Xuan guessed what Zhou Wen was up to.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded and said, “This is the only way to reach the Golden Palace before being killed by the Calamity-grade bullet.”</p>
<p>“Then take your time training. I don’t know how to push your skill to the Calamity grade. Speaking of which, your level should only be at the Mythical stage, right?” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Sigh, it’s indeed difficult.” Zhou Wen also knew that his level was too low. If he was at the Terror grade, there might be a chance of advancing Absolute Space to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also frustrated over this. If the Terror-grade Absolute Space couldn’t meet his requirements, it would probably be difficult for him to advance to the Calamity-grade.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen still had no clue about his advancement to the Terror grade. His four stats were already at 81 points and the eight Essence Energy Arts had already reached the Terror transformation stage, but Slaughterer didn’t stir. He couldn’t attain Terror transformation at all.</p>
<p>“If one needs to kill to advance, what kind of reasoning could it be that I didn’t get any reaction when I’ve already killed a Calamity-grade creature? Must I kill a Guardian?” Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that things weren’t that simple.</p>
<p>“Fat chance.” A man’s voice sounded as An Sheng accompanied An Tianzuo into the yard. The person who had spoken was An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo wasn’t far from the yard. His hearing was excellent, so he had heard Li Xuan and Zhou Wen’s conversation clearly. He knew that Zhou Wen wanted to advance a Mythical skill to the Calamity grade, and it was a spatial one at that. Therefore, he made that statement to himself. Although he wasn’t speaking to Zhou Wen, anyone could tell that he was talking about him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pretended not to hear him and ignored An Tianzuo. He looked at An Sheng and asked, “Ah Sheng, why are you so free? Why are you here?”</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, here’s the situation. Overseer and I have been purchasing Essence Crystal ores recently. You also know how much that thing needs Essence Crystals. We have already acquired most of the Essence Crystals on the market. Even if the other families have the goods, they will just hold back on selling to sell them at a higher price in this situation. It’s impossible for them to easily sell them to us. Therefore, Overseer and I plan on heading out to open up a dimensional zone that might have an Essence Crystal mine.”</p>
<p>Ah Sheng paused for a moment before saying, “You know the situation in Luoyang recently. All the major factions are watching us. I don’t know how many spies are in the city. If anything happens when we are out, there has to be a person at home to take care of everything. Do you think it’s convenient for you to temporarily take care of the family?”</p>
<p>“How long will it take?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.</p>
<p>If he wanted to watch over the area, he definitely couldn’t leave Luoyang before Ah Sheng and company returned.</p>
<p>“That’s hard to say. We will return in a week or so at the earliest. If something crops up, it’s hard to say. We’ll try our best to rush back in a month,” Ah Sheng said.</p>
<p>“A month!” Zhou Wen frowned slightly. If any creature entered the Venusian dimensional zone in a month, he wouldn’t be able to take advantage of it.</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng, tell him not to force himself if he doesn’t want to,” An Tianzuo said expressionlessly.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo was standing just beside him, so Zhou Wen could naturally hear him. An Tianzuo also knew this, but he refused to speak directly to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What Overseer means is that if you have something to do, there’s no need to force yourself. We can think of another solution. It’s just that Madam feels that we should rely on ourselves and not have outsiders come here.” An Sheng passed the message. It sounded the same as what An Tianzuo had said, but the feeling was completely different.</p>
<p>“Please help me inform the Overseer that if he wants me to stay, I definitely won’t force myself. However, this matter concerns Sis Lan and my father, so I won’t ignore it,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Overseer, Young Master Wen said that he’s Madam’s son. He will definitely take care of Madam and won’t let anything happen to the family..” An Sheng wiped the sweat off his forehead as he translated.</p>
<p>5</p>
<h3 id='chapter1280'>Chapter 1280: Handwritten Copy</h3>
<p>“Tell him to do something proper if he’s going to do anything. He shouldn’t be wasting his time on frivolities. If anything happens to the family, the one at home, Little Jing, or Ya’er because of this, I won’t let him off easily,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, the various families have been keeping a close eye on our family recently. Furthermore, those spies are everywhere. They will stoop to nothing to obtain the secret of the accelerator. They might even attack you, Madam, Ya’er, and Miss Jing while we aren’t around to threaten us. Overseer is very worried about everyone’s safety. You have to be careful. It’s fine if the An Estate is damaged. If necessary, you can give up on the An Estate. As long as the people are fine,” An Sheng translated again.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo glared at An Sheng as though he was saying: “Did I say that much?”</p>
<p>“Please tell Overseer that since I’ve agreed, I’ll naturally ensure their safety. There’s no need for him to spend time worrying. It’s best you get him to put in more effort and think about how to obtain some Essence Crystal mines,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Tell him that he doesn’t have to care about me…”</p>
<p>“Help me tell him that he doesn’t have to interfere in my matters…”</p>
<p>Li Xuan was dumbfounded by the side. He had seen quarrels before, but this was unprecedented.</p>
<p>“Um, can you speak for yourselves?” An Sheng’s head was about to explode from all the translation and he couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>“Humph.” An Tianzuo turned around and left without even sparing Zhou Wen a glance.</p>
<p>After An Tianzuo left, Li Xuan patted Zhou Wen on the shoulder and sighed, as though they were in the same boat. “Old Zhou, your days at the An family haven’t been good either.”</p>
<p>Back home, he was often criticized by Li Mobai, but he wasn’t as bold as Zhou Wen’s opposition to An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing bad either. I just don’t treat him as a human,” Zhou Wen said without a change in expression as he held his teacup.</p>
<p>“Pfft!” Li Xuan spat out the mouthful of tea he had just drunk.</p>
<p>He was probably the only person in the Federation who dared dismiss An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>As An Tianzuo walked, he said, “He’s frivolous, arrogant, self-important, and ignorant. He thinks he’s impressive just because he has some meager achievements. If all of humanity is like him, how are we to fight the dimension…”</p>
<p>An Sheng didn’t dare say a word as he listened while staying by An Tianzuo’s side.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you saying anything?” An Tianzuo spoke for a long time, but when he saw that An Sheng didn’t say a word, he stopped and turned to look at him.</p>
<p>“Overseer, you’re right,” An Sheng hurriedly said with his head lowered.</p>
<p>“That’s not what you’re thinking.” An Tianzuo snorted coldly.</p>
<p>“I…” An Sheng wanted to explain, but An Tianzuo interrupted him. “I don’t want to hear a patronizing explanation.”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>“Don’t beat about the bush. Just tell me. Isn’t that fellow infuriating?” An Tianzuo interrupted him again.</p>
<p>I think Young Master Wen thinks the same way too. An Sheng thought so, but he didn’t dare say it out loud. “That’s right. Young Master Wen has crossed the line. How can he only think about Madam and Ya’er? He has to consider the welfare of you and Miss Jing as well.”</p>
<p>An Tianzuo stopped again and glared at An Sheng as he said coldly, “Who said he has to consider our welfare? Do we need it?”</p>
<p>An Sheng could only lower his head and smile apologetically. “There’s definitely no need. I was just joking.”</p>
<p>“If you can’t control your tongue, I don’t mind helping you tame it. If you soak it in formalin, it should become obedient and not spout nonsense,” An Tianzuo said with a cold expression.</p>
<p>An Sheng hurriedly covered his face with his hand, as though indicating that he definitely wouldn’t spout nonsense. Please spare his tongue.</p>
<p>Only then did An Tianzuo continue walking in satisfaction. After leaving the Overseer’s residence, An Tianzuo came to the car. An Sheng pulled open the back door and covered the door frame with his hand.</p>
<p>However, An Tianzuo didn’t take a seat. Instead, he walked to the driver’s seat and pulled open the door. He didn’t immediately get in. He stopped and said to An Sheng, “Teacher got someone to return the information I sent him previously, right?”</p>
<p>An Sheng thought for a moment. There wasn’t any information sent recently, so he said, “The information I sent to Teacher was delivered more than a month ago. It was personally returned by Chancellor Leng. Have you forgotten?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Teacher has read the information, so it’s useless. Throw it away. I’ll leave it to you.” With that said, An Tianzuo got into the car and drove off.</p>
<p>Throw it away? An Sheng was slightly taken aback. The information wasn’t ordinary information, but stone monuments that were discovered in a mysterious dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Ignoring the content on them, even the stone monuments themselves were extremely precious items.</p>
<p>Although Leng Zongzheng had sent back a handwritten copy, that meant even more.</p>
<p>An Sheng remembered that Leng Zongzheng had said that the content recorded on it was useless to ordinary people, but was extremely precious for a spatial expert like him.</p>
<p>Back then, Leng Zongzheng had kept the original copy and had even specially made a copy before sending it over. The content was the same, but had Leng Zongzheng’s annotations. An Tianzuo had deliberately kept it in his private collection.</p>
<p>On second thought, An Sheng immediately understood something. He hurriedly turned around and returned to the An family. He was the only one who could enter the room where An Tianzuo stored his private collection.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After Li Xuan left, Zhou Wen continued studying Absolute Space. It was only a matter of time before he broke through to the Terror grade, but the more he studied, the more he felt that Absolute Space would hardly be able to play the role he imagined if it was only at the Terror grade.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, are you there?” An Sheng knocked on Zhou Wen’s door.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you leave? Why are you back?” Zhou Wen opened the door and asked An Sheng in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Not yet. There’s some information here. It’s been copied and annotated by Chancellor Leng. Take a look and see if it’s useful.” An Sheng handed Zhou Wen four thick diaries.</p>
<p>Chancellor Leng’s annotated copy? Zhou Wen took the diary and casually flipped through a few pages. He was immediately mesmerized by the content.</p>
<p>“Where did this come from?” Zhou Wen asked as he flipped through it.</p>
<p>“Apparently someone obtained it from a mysterious dimensional zone. I’m not too sure about the details. If it’s useful, give it a read.” An Sheng opened his mouth as though he wanted to say something, but after some hesitation, he didn’t say anything. He bade farewell and left.</p>
<p>This is clearly the insight and experience written by a spatial expert. I’m afraid the person who wrote this might very well be a Calamity-grade expert. For Chancellor Leng to be able to explain so much with his annotations, his understanding of spatial powers is extremely profound… Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised by the content.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he also knew why it had to be copied by hand and not stored using electronic equipment. The meaning contained in each stroke was something electronic equipment couldn’t present.</p>
<p>It wasn’t enough to just look at the content. One had to look at the concepts within the words.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1281'>Chapter 1281: Nether Lotus</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen was a spatial expert, so it wasn’t difficult for him to understand the content and annotations. Although Zhou Wen already knew a lot of the content, there were indeed some unique points that gave him many thoughts and ideas.</p>
<p>Based on the content, the person who wrote it had to be an existence with extremely high attainments in space. Only then could they stand at a high vantage point to explain certain problems.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng’s annotations were also very precise. Furthermore, he had written quite a number of his understanding and insights into spatial powers. It was quite an inspiration to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Combining his insights and experience, Absolute Space broke through to the Terror grade in just a few hours. Furthermore, it was constantly improving.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t know if he could really break through to the Calamity grade, the speed at which he improved was already rather shocking.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was obsessed with studying Absolute Space. Apart from the necessary dungeon respawns every day, he spent the rest of his time studying it.</p>
<p>However, Ice Maiden wasn’t in a good mood. She had been worried about the flower girl all this time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know much about the dimension and didn’t know how terrifying the Flower Goddess was, but Ice Maiden knew her all too well. She was a true dimensional big shot, a supreme existence at the Apocalypse level.</p>
<p>Even if she wasn’t willing to personally descend to Earth, just mobilizing a large number of Flower race experts and Guardians to descend was enough to cause a huge calamity for Earth.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden was so worried mainly because she was a dimensional creature. She ultimately had to return in the future. Zhou Wen could ignore the repercussions, but she couldn’t.</p>
<p>If the Flower Goddess knew that she, an ice demon, had captured the flower girl and wanted to kill her, the ice demons might suffer greatly. It was even possible that the demons would abandon her to appease the Flower Goddess’s rage.</p>
<p>Of course, this was only the worst case scenario. It might not come to that.</p>
<p>What should I do? How can I make that flower girl let bygones be bygones? Ice Maiden racked her brains, hoping to come up with a perfect solution.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, I want to have a chat with that flower girl.” Ice Maiden failed to come up with a good solution despite racking her brains. She planned on understanding the flower girl’s current state of mind and why she had come to Earth.</p>
<p>In fact, Ice Maiden was very puzzled. Logically speaking, even if members of the Flower race were sent to Earth, they would be cannon fodder. How could one with the Tear of the Flower Goddess be sent here?</p>
<p>“Sure.” Although Zhou Wen felt that the possibility of the Flower Goddess descending wasn’t high, he didn’t wish to provoke trouble if there was a better solution.</p>
<p>Just in case, Zhou Wen got Ice Maiden and flower girl to meet in the Chaos Bead to prevent her from escaping or sending a message to the Flower race.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden had the same thought. She was more afraid of something happening.</p>
<p>The space in the Chaos Bead was huge. The space of every item could be independent. All one could see was a chaotic fog. No matter how one traversed the chaos fog, they couldn’t really make any substantial movement. In fact, they were just going in circles.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sent Ice Maiden to the flower girl. With a wave of her hand, she defrosted the ice that encased the flower girl’s body and restored her freedom.</p>
<p>The flower girl had remained conscious while frozen, so she knew what had happened. After being defrosted, she only looked at Ice Maiden and didn’t do anything else, much less attack her.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden couldn’t help but frown when she saw this.</p>
<p>If the flower girl had attacked immediately, that meant that she was a mere boor. That would have made it easier to deal with her.</p>
<p>However, from the flower girl’s expression, it was clear that she was a very calm person. Such a person was clearly even harder to deal with. Even if she verbally agreed to a reconciliation, Ice Maiden wouldn’t easily believe her.</p>
<p>“How may I address you?” Ice Maiden probed as she looked at the flower girl.</p>
<p>“Nether Lotus.” The flower girl looked at Ice Maiden and continued, “You should be an ice demon, right? As a dimensional creature, why are you opposing us by helping the humans?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to be your enemy. You initiated the attack.” Ice Maiden paused and asked, “Why did you come to Earth?”</p>
<p>“And why did you come to Earth?” Nether Lotus didn’t answer as she returned the question ad verbatim.</p>
<p>“I’m just an unimportant person among the ice demons. It’s very normal for me to be sent to Earth as cannon fodder. However, you have the Tear of the Flower Goddess. Clearly, you hold a special status in the eyes of the Flower Goddess. You shouldn’t be here,” Ice Maiden continued probing.</p>
<p>Nether Lotus sneered. “Is that why you don’t dare to kill me?”</p>
<p>“No matter how strong the Flower Goddess is, it’s difficult for her to directly interfere in Earth’s affairs. Earth isn’t as terrible as you imagine. Even if the Flower race really attacks Earth on a large scale, they might not be able to gain an advantage when the time comes. Furthermore, the Flower Goddess might not make a big fuss over you.” Ice Maiden looked at Nether Lotus and said in a serious manner, “I didn’t kill you because I’m curious why you came to such a place. This isn’t a place you should be.”</p>
<p>Nether Lotus wore a hesitant expression. She seemed to know that it wasn’t easy for dimensional creatures to descend to Earth. Furthermore, they were restricted by Earth’s rules. She had already experienced this herself.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Flower Goddess didn’t know that she had come to Earth. If she really died here, it was difficult to say if the Flower Goddess could sense it. After all, this was Earth, an ancient forbidden land. It was very difficult for information to be transmitted.</p>
<p>Nether Lotus’s expression made Ice Maiden realize something, so she said, “It’s impossible for a Flower race like you to be sent to a place like Earth. There’s only one possibility. You sneaked in here yourself.”</p>
<p>“Who said I sneaked in? The Flower Goddess sent me to Earth for a mission,” said Nether Lotus immediately.</p>
<p>However, her reaction had already betrayed her. How could she deceive a shrewd person like Ice Maiden?</p>
<p>“Actually, we’re all the same. I came to Earth secretly just for that thing.” Ice Maiden felt relieved.</p>
<p>Nether Lotus looked experienced, but in fact, she was still too young. She was just pretending to be calm. She wasn’t as difficult to deal with as she imagined. She was like a flower who grew up in a greenhouse flower, one that had never experienced storms.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Nether Lotus wasn’t experienced enough, but she wasn’t retarded. It was impossible for her to be easily tricked by Ice Maiden.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden didn’t say anything. However, she suddenly unleashed her Ice Demon Monarch’s bloodline and transformed into an Ice Demon Queen.</p>
<p>“Ah! Ice Demon Monarch’s bloodline… You are the Ice Demon Monarch’s descendant… Why are you here… Could it be that you came to obtain Earth’s Companion Beasts?” Nether Lotus widened her eyes. Her understanding was the same as Ice Maiden’s. They both believed that with an identity like theirs, it was impossible for her to be sent to Earth unless there were special circumstances.</p>
<p>And there was only one special exception that Nether Lotus knew—it was the same reason that she had for secretly coming to Earth.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1282'>Chapter 1282: Embodiment of Evil</h3>
<p>Nether Lotus seemed to realize that she had slipped up and immediately shut up.</p>
<p>“Sigh… I heard from my elders that that dimensional zone might be where Earth’s Companion Beast resides, but I was captured by that evil human just as I arrived on Earth,” Ice Maiden said pretentiously.</p>
<p>In fact, her situation was similar to what she had said. Her emotions were also rather real.</p>
<p>“You were also captured by him?” Nether Lotus seemed to find it unbelievable.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden said with a shameful look, “You will not believe the evil humans are capable of. It’s practically perverted, and he’s even worse than a pervert. If I don’t obey his orders, he will first sever my limbs and then cook them before forcing me to…”</p>
<p>The more Nether Lotus heard, the more horrified she became. She was really frightened. Although death was very frightening to her, she could still overcome some psychological barriers.</p>
<p>However, what Ice Maiden said was something she couldn’t tolerate. Just the thought of it made her shudder as her body trembled.</p>
<p>If she were to be treated that way, she would rather die. Nether Lotus had constructed Zhou Wen as an evil super pervert inwardly.</p>
<p>“Before me, many dimensional creatures had already suffered his abuse. They lived a life worse than death. In the end, they were killed and made into xiaolongbao when he got sick of them… Don’t you know what xiaolongbao is? It’s the kind of mincemeat stuffing…” As Ice Maiden spoke, she thought to herself, It’s better to have one dead than both. If the Flower Goddess descends, you will die no matter what. Just shoulder my blame for me.</p>
<p>“Despicable human, how dare he treat us like this? When my mother comes, she’ll definitely rip him to pieces. No, we’ll let him have a taste of his own medicine before killing him,” said Nether Lotus through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>This Nether Lotus can’t be the Flower Goddess’s daughter, right!? Ice Maiden was secretly alarmed, but she pretended not to notice anything amiss. She continued, “Now that we are in his hands, we can only feign civility and preserve our usefulness. When we find an opportunity, we can kill him together. During this period of time, you mustn’t disobey him. I don’t wish to see my kind die again.”</p>
<p>Nether Lotus was already beginning to believe Ice Maiden. When she heard that, she said, “I understand. Don’t worry. I’ll pretend to obey him and find an opportunity to join forces with you to kill him.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s it. Preserve our lives and maintain our usefulness. Then, wait for an opportunity to kill him and avenge ourselves and our dead dimensional compatriots,” Ice Maiden said righteously.</p>
<p>“I’m glad I met you…” Nether Lotus nodded repeatedly.</p>
<p>“By the way, don’t try to escape. He has cast an evil curse on us. Once we escape, he will activate the curse. When that happens, our bodies will fester bit by bit, but we won’t die until our bodies are riddled with holes and we wail in agony for three years…” Ice Maiden continued tricking Nether Lotus.</p>
<p>In Nether Lotus’s mind, Zhou Wen’s evilness had increased exponentially. He was already an existence at the level of a super unparalleled demon king.</p>
<p>“Bear with it for the time being. I’ll quickly think of a way to get him to release you. When the time comes, you must not disobey his orders, or all our efforts will be in vain.” Before Ice Maiden left, she specially exhorted Nether Lotus.</p>
<p>“Got it. Thank you.” Nether Lotus’s eyes were filled with gratitude.</p>
<p>“When did I do those things to you?” Zhou Wen said coldly as he released Ice Maiden.</p>
<p>“I had no choice. I just wanted to get some information out of her. Now, we can confirm that she’s very likely the Flower Goddess’s daughter. However, she had sneaked out. The Flower Goddess doesn’t know that she’s on Earth. Also, she might have eavesdropped on the news regarding Earth’s Companion Beast from Flower Goddess and knows which dimensional zone has Earth’s strongest Companion Beast,” Ice Maiden said as she looked around.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could tell what she was up to; there was no need for her to repeat herself.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I’ll have to take the blame for you if the Flower Goddess really descends, right?” Zhou Wen curled his lips.</p>
<p>“If the Flower Goddess really descends, you will be a dead man regardless. It doesn’t matter if you take additional blame,” Ice Maiden said.</p>
<p>“I’ll remember this. If you can’t get any information about that dimensional zone from her, I’ll try all those methods of torture you mentioned on you,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden’s expression changed before she forced a smile and said, “I’ll do my best.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want you to try your best. I want you to guarantee it.” Zhou Wen had to figure out the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>If it was really as the dimension said—that dimensional zone was where Earth’s Companion Beast was—then he had to protect it at all costs. He definitely couldn’t let the fellows from the dimension succeed.</p>
<p>If they really lured Earth’s Companion Beast out, Earth would be doomed.</p>
<p>After handing such a mentally-taxing task to Ice Maiden, Zhou Wen began studying Absolute Space. Now, it was already ten thousand times bigger.</p>
<p>However, Absolute Space still remained a cubic meter in size. It didn’t continue to expand as though this was its limit.</p>
<p>Ten thousand times meant ten thousand meters. To light, this distance was nothing. It wasn’t enough time for Zhou Wen to react, much less dodge.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, even if I reach the peak of the Terror grade, I probably won’t be able to extend space sufficiently. Is there any other way? Zhou Wen felt that he couldn’t only place his hopes on Absolute Space. There wasn’t much hope of advancing it to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen didn’t give up on studying it. He still tried his best to perfect it, but at the same time, he began searching for more possibilities.</p>
<p>For a similar spatial Terror-grade skill, what if I combine Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping and Absolute Space, I wonder if it gives rise to some possibilities? Zhou Wen kept thinking about this problem.</p>
<p>Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping could ignore spatial distances to exchange objects, and Absolute Space was similar to a spatial bubble. Zhou Wen felt that there was a possibility stemming from the combination of the two, but he had yet to figure out how the two could be combined.</p>
<p>During the few days he stayed in Luoyang, there weren’t many problems with the Overseer Manor. Typically, with Qin Wufu presiding over it, Zhou Wen didn’t need to deal with the details.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>One day, when Zhou Wen was grinding the Venusian instance dungeon, another Golden Battle God Companion Egg dropped. Now, he was just short of Mark I and Mark IV before he gathered all six Golden Battle Gods.</p>
<p>Can six Terror-grade Golden Battle Gods fuse into a Calamity-grade Companion Beast? Zhou Wen was filled with anticipation.</p>
<p>If he could obtain a Calamity-grade Companion Beast, all the problems would be resolved. He wouldn’t have to go through so much trouble.</p>
<p>The Cube stirred again as an unfamiliar creature appeared on the platform of the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1283'>Chapter 1283: Dwarf</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>It was a red-skinned dwarf, only about a meter tall. He wore a grass skirt and had a green leaf on his head. He looked very strange.</p>
<p>After he entered the Venusian dimensional zone, the Metal Guard immediately launched an attack. When the bullet arrived in front of him, the dwarf suddenly opened his mouth and revealed his serrated teeth to bite the bullet.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The bullet was actually crushed by his teeth. The dwarf quickly gritted his teeth and crushed the bullet in a few bites before stretching his neck and swallowing it.</p>
<p>Before the Metal Guard could fire a second shot, the dwarf rushed in front of him and bit off half the barrel. After chewing twice, he stretched his neck and swallowed it.</p>
<p>What happened next shocked the people watching the battle through the Cube.</p>
<p>The dwarf swallowed the Metal Guard alive. It was unknown how such a small body could contain the Metal Guard’s huge body.</p>
<p>Hordes of Metal Guards rushed out, but the dwarf was like a tiger in a flock of sheep. His body kept moving like a ghost, biting the Metal Guards to death.</p>
<p>The Golden Battle God’s bullet was also bitten by the dwarf. Be it freezing, flames, explosions, or lightning bullets, they were all crushed and swallowed by the dwarf, completely unable to injure his body.</p>
<p>“Those teeth are really good!” Li Xuan said as he shivered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, who was watching the livestream with Li Xuan, looked thoughtfully at the dwarf. With that frown, what was on his mind?</p>
<p>“Hey, what are you doing? I’m talking to you?” Li Xuan extended his hand and shook it in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen snapped to his senses and said, “Why do you think this dwarf can devour so much metal with his tiny body?”</p>
<p>“It probably has organs similar to storage spaces in its body, or perhaps its stomach has a super melting function, melting all the metal?” Li Xuan guessed.</p>
<p>“Both are possible, but here’s what I’m thinking. Tell me if you agree.” Zhou Wen glanced at the dwarf who was still chewing the Golden Battle God and continued, “He’s like a trash processor or a shredder. After something passes through his body, it will ultimately land in a trash bag.”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t conflict with my guess. The trash bag could be an organ similar to a storage space that can hold large amounts of things.” Li Xuan didn’t understand the difference between Zhou Wen’s explanation and what he had said.</p>
<p>“But what if the trash bag is full?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, it won’t be that easy to fill it up. Even if it’s really full, he can choose not to eat. He can just eat after digesting what’s inside him.” Li Xuan still didn’t know what Zhou Wen meant.</p>
<p>“What if he has to eat despite being full?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“That goes without saying. Of course he will burst,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head and said, “We previously said that if he’s a shredder, he needs to change the trash bag when it’s full. He just needs to change the trash bag.”</p>
<p>Li Xuan found what Zhou Wen was saying baffling. The dwarf wasn’t really a shredder. How could there be a new trash bag to replace it?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen seemed to be talking to Li Xuan, but he also seemed to be muttering to himself, “Where should I find a second trash bag? Should I create a second trash bag? However, even if there’s a second, third, or even a tenth trash bag, it’s still unsatisfactory… Right… Wheels… If they’re in the form of wheels, they can be repeatedly used…”</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, what are you talking about?” Li Xuan failed to understand what Zhou Wen was saying despite listening for a long time.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen ignored him. He got up and gathered his strength with both hands, as though he was producing something in front of him. Li Xuan only saw the space in front of Zhou Wen distort, but was unsure what he was doing.</p>
<p>Why is this fellow only thinking about these strange things all day? He doesn’t know how to enjoy life at all. Li Xuan knew that Zhou Wen had thought of something regarding cultivation and was trying to break through. He watched from the side and didn’t disturb him again. He also helped watch over him to prevent others from disturbing him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been considering the problem of Absolute Space all this while. Under normal circumstances, it was impossible for a Terror-grade Absolute Space to withstand a bullet at the speed of light. It was difficult even to stall for time, so he had to take a different approach.</p>
<p>When he saw the scene of the dwarf devouring the Metal Guards, he suddenly thought of a possible solution. He felt that he might be able to create multiple Absolute Spaces and arrange them like wheels before quickly spinning them. This would allow the bullets to repeatedly pass through multiple Absolute Spaces without reaching Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Of course, the spinning speed of the wheels was a problem. If Absolute Space’s rotation speed wasn’t fast enough, it couldn’t connect to the preceding Absolute Space. It would be impossible to achieve a cycle.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping technique as well. If he could constantly swap three or more Absolute Spaces, he might be able to resolve this problem.</p>
<p>Of course, this was only a theory. Whether it could really succeed depended on actual operation.</p>
<p>Now, he was trying to create multiple Absolute Spaces, but the outcome was disappointing. Creating multiple Absolute Spaces wasn’t easy.</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn’t that Zhou Wen didn’t have enough Essence Energy, but the characteristics of Absolute Space itself were very special. Zhou Wen could only maintain the existence of a single Absolute Space, so he couldn’t create a second.</p>
<p>It was as though there was a force that restrained the existence of Absolute Space. A second Absolute Space couldn’t exist at the same time.</p>
<p>If I can’t create a second Absolute Space, what about letting Absolute Space spin itself? No, no. This isn’t right. I have to create multiple Absolute Spaces. Zhou Wen stopped and fell into deep thought. He thought about how to resolve the problem of having multiple Absolute Spaces. He flipped through the book An Sheng had sent over, hoping to obtain some inspiration from it.</p>
<p>After thinking for a while, he still couldn’t find a solution. Meanwhile on the livestream, the Calamity-grade bullet had already been fired and hit the dwarf’s face.</p>
<p>The dwarf’s body flew out and slammed into the metal wall. Everyone thought that he had been killed, but on careful look, they realized that the dwarf’s teeth had clenched the Calamity-grade bullet.</p>
<p>Smoke was still emitting from between the teeth and the bullet, as though the friction was very intense. However, the Calamity-grade bullet had been caught.</p>
<p>“These teeth… are so hard…” Everyone felt their teeth ache.</p>
<p>Then, the dwarf rushed through the door. The bullets shot over and were bitten by him again, but his body was also sent flying by the bullets as he slammed into the wall again.</p>
<p>Time and time again, the first six bullets were all caught by the dwarf with his teeth. He was like an agile beast.. No matter which direction the bullets flew from, they would be precisely caught by his teeth.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1284'>Chapter 1284: Good Junior Brother</h3>
<p>People watched the live broadcast nervously. Although the first six bullets were powerful and beyond human, several creatures had proven to humanity that they could dodge or even block them head-on.</p>
<p>However, no creature seemed to be able to resist the seventh bullet head-on.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>When the seventh gunshot sounded, everyone couldn’t help but tremble. When they took a careful look, they realized that the dwarf’s body had slammed into the wall again.</p>
<p>However, this time, even the metal wall had caved in, forming a circular pit.</p>
<p>The dwarf’s body was embedded in the circular pit. The powerful shockwave had sent his hair flying. His mouth was covered in blood, and between his teeth, a bullet that looked like a spark was spinning rapidly. It ground against his teeth and produced ear-piercing sounds and smoke.</p>
<p>Just this scene left one’s teeth tingling in pain.</p>
<p>The dwarf bit the bullet, but the bullet was still spinning like a drill. Perhaps the moment he relaxed, the bullet would drill into his head and penetrate it.</p>
<p>This was the first time humans had seen the seventh bullet clearly, but it was only relative. In fact, due to the spinning speed and the intense sparks, they couldn’t see what the bullet looked like. All they could see was a general outline.</p>
<p>It was completely different from the first six bullets. After the first six bullets were shot out, their momentum would slowly diminish.</p>
<p>However, the momentum within the seventh bullet didn’t diminish. It was as though it wouldn’t stop unless it killed someone. The momentum showed no signs of weakening.</p>
<p>The dwarf’s teeth were smoking, and his gums were bleeding profusely. He used his hands and feet to support himself and jumped out of the hole with difficulty. With the bullet between his teeth, he walked towards the door step by step.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>The sound of firing rang again. Before the dwarf could resolve the bullet between his teeth, the eighth and ninth bullets came at him.</p>
<p>This time, he didn’t have the ability to bite down again. As his body was resisting the seventh bullet, it was difficult for him to move quickly. All he could do was dodge the eighth bullet. The ninth bullet hit his arm, causing blood to gush out.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>Bullets kept firing over, leaving bullet holes in the dwarf’s body. Blood quickly stained his already red skin.</p>
<p>The dwarf finally couldn’t keep the seventh bullet between his teeth. The moment his teeth relaxed slightly, the seventh bullet bounced off and shot into his head.</p>
<p>The sound of a head exploding made one’s heart run cold. The powerful dwarf had ultimately died due to the seventh bullet.</p>
<p>As the dwarf died, the seventh bullet vanished, as though Death’s mission of reaping a life had been fulfilled.</p>
<p>As there were no outsiders in the dimensional zone, the Cube stopped broadcasting. It was unknown if the dwarf left anything behind, so no one dared to enter to take a look.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“It appears it’s impossible to withstand the seventh bullet with brute force,” Zhang Chunqiu sighed.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, there are roughly three ways to withstand the seventh bullet. The first way is to reach the Golden Palace before the seventh bullet is shot, preventing the seventh bullet from coming out. The second way is to find someone to die in their stead. As long as the seventh bullet kills, the calamity would be met. There’s also another way—Rely on something hard like the Looter King and one can forcefully fend off the bullet and cause the trajectory of the bullet to deviate. However, this only stalls for time. The bullet will still fly back. It’s just a temporary solution,” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu nodded slightly. “After this battle, the various factions have more or less figured out the ability of the seventh bullet. I believe it won’t be long before people begin challenging the Venusian dimensional zone.”</p>
<p>“Which method do you think they will employ?” Xia Liuchuan asked.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu shook his head and didn’t say a word. As an old friend of his, Xia Liuchuan already understood what he meant. When the time came, most people would use the second method. There would be people using human lives to force their way to the Golden Palace.</p>
<p>After all, only the seventh bullet required death. The other bullets could be dealt with through other means.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In the Taklamakan Desert, Liu Yun’s body was buried in the sand, motionless as though he had melded with the desert.</p>
<p>Streams of light streaked across the air several times before disappearing into the distance.</p>
<p>“Son-of-a-b*tches, you ain’t got nothing on me.” Liu Yun crawled out of the sand and spat in the direction of the streams of light.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Liu Yun’s body stiffened as his expression turned extremely ugly.</p>
<p>A sword had been placed on his neck at some point in time, but Liu Yun didn’t know who was holding the sword and standing behind him.</p>
<p>“Friend, don’t joke around. There’s always room for negotiation.” Liu Yun said with a smile.</p>
<p>“I never like to joke,” the person behind him said.</p>
<p>When Liu Yun heard the voice, he was slightly taken aback. He carefully turned his body to look at the person holding the sword and saw a young man. He was fair and clean with good facial features. He wore a purple trench coat that exuded a sinister beauty.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother Zhong, you scared me to death. Don’t joke around like that. You nearly gave me a heart attack.” Liu Yun recognized the person in front of him and wanted to push the blade away with his finger.</p>
<p>“I’ve said it before. I don’t like to joke.” Zhong Ziya had no intention of retracting the sword. The blade pressed closer to Liu Yun’s neck and immediately sliced into his skin. Blood trickled down the blade.</p>
<p>“We are fellow disciples. Why can’t we talk things out nicely? Is there a need for this?” Liu Yun’s body stiffened as he forced a smile.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you two choices. Help me do something, or I’ll tie you up and throw you into the headquarters of the League of Guardians,” Zhong Ziya said.</p>
<p>“You might as well kill me,” Liu Yun said gloomily.</p>
<p>“You’re my senior brother after all. It’s not appropriate to kill you personally,” Zhong Ziya said.</p>
<p>“Thanks a lot.” Liu Yun almost blew a gasket. He rolled his eyes and said, “You want me to help you go to the Venusian dimensional zone, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.” Zhong Ziya nodded.</p>
<p>“I can help you, but I have a condition,” Liu Yun said.</p>
<p>“Speak,” Zhong Ziya said.</p>
<p>“I want Junior Brother to accompany us,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“He can’t go.” Zhong Ziya directly rejected Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“Why? Don’t you think that the success rate will be much higher if Junior Brother comes along?” Liu Yun asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“He can’t die, but you can,” Zhong Ziya said.</p>
<p>“Thanks A LOT. You are really my good junior brother,” Liu Yun said through gritted teeth.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1285'>Chapter 1285: Humanity’s First Attempt</h3>
<p>Nothing major happened for half a month. The Federation and overseas faction seemed quiet. Apart from the occasional news of dimensional creatures breaking through on a large scale, the world enjoyed some level of peace.</p>
<p>Over the past few days, Zhou Wen had two Golden Battle God Halberds drop, one Rejuvenation Pill, and a Golden Battle God Mark I. Now, of the six Golden Battle Gods, Zhou Wen had five. The only thing he lacked was Mark IV.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had the intention of figuring out the Founding Emperor Tomb, Chess Mountain, Mount Laojun, Ant City, and other dungeons, his focus wasn’t on them. He had been studying the problem of Absolute Space.</p>
<p>Under his constant research, he had resolved the problem of not simultaneously having two Absolute Spaces.</p>
<p>Using the Spacetime Bandit’s delay function, Zhou Wen successfully made two Absolute Spaces appear at the same time.</p>
<p>This was the result of experimentation, to which the principle behind it eluded Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>He first used Spacetime Bandit to cast Absolute Space. Due to the delay, Absolute Space didn’t immediately appear. And without using Spacetime Bandit, he cast another Absolute Space.</p>
<p>When the delayed Absolute Space appeared, two Absolute Spaces would coexist.</p>
<p>However, this only allowed two Absolute Spaces to simultaneously exist. If he continuously released a few Absolute Spaces within the time window of Spacetime Bandit, the outcome would only be a delay in the appearance of an Absolute Space. It would disappear in succession, replacing the previous one and leaving only the final delayed one.</p>
<p>Only two Absolute Spaces could coexist with each other through the use of a delay and zero delay.</p>
<p>Although two Absolute Spaces were lacking, it gave him more maneuverability.</p>
<p>Now, the new problem was how to spin the two Absolute Spaces. The speed of moving Absolute Spaces definitely couldn’t keep up with the speed of light, so he had to use a special method to allow the two Absolute Spaces to switch and connect.</p>
<p>The Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping technique could only swap between two Absolute Spaces, but it couldn’t form a wheel pattern unless he had a third Absolute Space.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it took too long to use Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping. It was very difficult to achieve a seamless effect.</p>
<p>How can I make two Absolute Spaces automatically connect seamlessly? Zhou Wen could only continue his research.</p>
<p>He had also watched the battle of the dwarf and knew that if his spatial skill could succeed, it was very likely that he could trap the seventh bullet in the spatial wheel. Then, the sure-kill seventh bullet would never be able to injure him.</p>
<p>Under Ice Maiden’s efforts, Nether Lotus was completely brainwashed.</p>
<p>In Nether Lotus’s mind, Zhou Wen was an evil human pervert. Furthermore, he had placed an inescapable curse on her and Ice Maiden. All she could do was feign civility and obey Zhou Wen’s orders.</p>
<p>Recently, there had been many large-scale break-out of dimensional creatures in the dimensional zones near Luoyang. Zhou Wen got Ice Maiden and Nether Lotus to help Qin Wufu deal with them to prevent them from constantly appearing in front of him.</p>
<p>Although Ice Maiden wanted to go to Chess Mountain, she knew that there was a horrifying existence there and needed Zhou Wen’s strength to enter. Therefore, she had no intention of running.</p>
<p>With her watching Nether Lotus, Zhou Wen felt at ease. Ice Maiden was an ambitious woman. She wouldn’t give up on the Demon God Bloodline Catalog so easily.</p>
<p>Furthermore, ever since she had learned that Nether Lotus had information regarding Earth’s Companion Beasts, Ice Maiden had been pondering over how to get the information out of her.</p>
<p>“Chess Mountain… Chess Mountain actually has this… It’s no wonder you came here… So you’ve already decided…” When Nether Lotus came to Chess Mountain to help the Sunset Army clean up the break-out creatures, she immediately exclaimed.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden realized that the place Nether Lotus was referring to was Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden was pleasantly surprised, but she wore a poker face. “It’s best you don’t spout nonsense.”</p>
<p>Nether Lotus now wholeheartedly trusted Ice Maiden. She believed that Ice Maiden definitely knew of the news, so she whispered, “This is a good opportunity. We can go in and take a look. Perhaps we can really find Earth’s strongest Companion Beast. With such an existence, we don’t have to be afraid of that evil human.”</p>
<p>“There’s no rush. Chess Mountain is filled with danger. There must be a Calamity-grade existence inside. With our present strength, it’s impossible for us to obtain any benefits even if we enter. We might even die inside,” Ice Maiden said.</p>
<p>“Then what should we do?” Nether Lotus hadn’t expected Earth to be so horrifying. Her understanding of Earth came from the previous Cube ranking battle.</p>
<p>“Don’t be anxious. I’ve already thought of a solution. As long as we do it well, we can lure that evil human into Chess Mountain. When the time comes, he and the creature in Chess Mountain will suffer an internecine outcome, and we can reap the benefits…” Ice Maiden said.</p>
<p>“Can we really do that? We can’t have that evil human obtain the strongest Companion Beast,” said Nether Lotus worriedly.</p>
<p>“Therefore, we need to wait for an opportunity. The plan needs to be meticulous. There can’t be any mistakes.” Ice Maiden continued the bluff.</p>
<p>“I guess that’s the only way.” Nether Lotus was somewhat vexed. If she had known that this would happen, she wouldn’t have sneaked over alone. At the very least, she would have brought a Calamity-grade helper.</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>After more than half a month in the doldrums, a figure finally appeared on the Cube’s screen.</p>
<p>All the major media outlets immediately rushed to report. When people saw the person on the Cube screen, they were stunned.</p>
<p>“Human… It’s a human…”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that Thief Sage? What’s he doing there?”</p>
<p>“No, look at that person. He has horns on his head. He’s not human.”</p>
<p>“Ah! That’s the Holy Spirit Association’s Ox Demon.”</p>
<p>“Heavens, there’s also Fairy Peacock and True Martial. Could that fellow be… Ah… That’s Ya… The line up consists of the elites of the Holy Spirit Association… Are they trying to clear the Venusian dimensional zone?”</p>
<p>“That will be tough. Although they are all Terror-grade powerhouses, it’s still too difficult to pass through the defense of the Calamity-grade creature.”</p>
<p>The people were quickly recognized. Although the various factions had long expected someone to make an attempt, they never expected the Holy Spirit Association to be the first.</p>
<p>Everyone talked excitedly. Although the Holy Spirit Association was half-human, people weren’t absolutely against it due to Ya.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit Association was also a very strange organization. At the very least, ordinary people didn’t have much hatred or resistance towards it.</p>
<p>However, because the Holy Spirit Association had been constantly trying to kill the Guardians and subvert the Federation, it had been designated as an evil organization by the Federation. This was how it had always been promoted.</p>
<p>However, the publicity wasn’t very good. People didn’t have a good impression of the League of Guardians either, so they didn’t believe that what they said was true.</p>
<p>With the main heads of the Holy Spirit Association appearing one after another, and with them all ranked at the top of the wanted list, it gave people a very odd feeling.</p>
<p>Was a group of federal wanted criminals, who weren’t purely human, capable of representing humanity?</p>
<h3 id='chapter1286'>Chapter 1286: Level Clearing</h3>
<p>The Holy Spirit Association didn’t drip their blood to enter the Venusian dimensional zone. Instead, with Liu Yun’s help, they directly teleported into the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Liu Yun first brought Ox Demon into the room. As the Metal Guard fired, Ox Demon’s tall figure charged forward suddenly. With a single punch, he blasted the bullet along with the Metal Guard apart. His strength was shocking.</p>
<p>The more powerful a person in the Holy Spirit Association was, the higher their bounty on the Federation’s wanted list. Without a doubt, the Ox Demon was the one with the highest bounty in the Holy Spirit Association other than Ya.</p>
<p>The number of Guardians he had killed was probably in the triple digits. Most of them were members of the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>Ya, Fairy Peacock, and True Martial were sent over by Liu Yun one by one. As for Ox Demon, he had already started a massacre inside. The Metal Guards that came out of the six doors were killed with his punches one after another, no different from crushing ants.</p>
<p>Without needing the others to do anything, Ox Demon finished off all the Metal Guards.</p>
<p>The Golden Battle God Mark I came out of the door and shot a freezing bullet at Ox Demon. Ox Demon was a hot-tempered individual and had no intention of retreating. His armor-covered body tore through the air and his fist smashed into the freezing bullet.</p>
<p>As the fist collided with the freezing bullet, the freezing bullet shattered, turning into a large icy fog that spread out. Ox Demon broke through the ice fog and arrived in front of the Golden Battle God. His body was covered in frost, but he thought nothing of it. He punched at the Golden Battle God again and again.</p>
<p>As the fist hit the metal, the Golden Battle God’s metal body failed to withstand Ox Demon’s punches. His entire body caved in as fist imprints appeared everywhere. Finally, his chest was shattered by the punch, and even his energy source exploded.</p>
<p>“What terrifying power,” said Xia Liuchuan.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu thought for a moment and said, “Ox Demon’s original name was Zhang Jing. He was originally the son of a local tycoon. Back then, his father’s influence locally wasn’t inferior to An Tianzuo’s status in Luoyang. Unfortunately, for some reason, the Zhang family collapsed without good reason. Most of the Zhang family’s direct descendants died. Zhang Jing vanished and when he appeared again, he was already the Holy Spirit Association’s Ox Demon. The Guardian he fused with should be of pure Strength and Constitution. He doesn’t have any long-range attacks, but his Strength, Constitution, and Speed are alarmingly powerful.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Zhang Chunqiu said, “According to some clues, the Zhang family’s decline might be related to the dimension, but it hasn’t been confirmed.”</p>
<p>“You know very well,” Xia Liuchuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>“After all, we share the same Zhang surname. I do pay a little attention,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>As the two of them spoke, Ox Demon had already killed three Golden Battle Gods. His bravery was awe-inspiring.</p>
<p>“Is this the strength of the Holy Spirit Association? Just an Ox Demon is already so terrifying. I wonder how strong Ya is now.”</p>
<p>“After all, he’s an expert who once made a name for himself on the same battlefield as Human Sovereign. Ya’s strength is definitely extraordinary.”</p>
<p>“Back then, Ya could already defeat a Calamity-grade entity who descended with a borrowed body. Now, he might be able to defeat a true Calamity-grade existence.”</p>
<p>People were very curious about Ya. Outsiders only knew Ya, but they didn’t know that he was Wang Mingyuan’s student, Zhong Ziya.</p>
<p>In the League of Guardians, Blood Shaman wore a nasty expression. The way he stared at Ox Demon was somewhat terrifying.</p>
<p>Over the past few days, the League of Guardians and the Holy Spirit Association had fought quite a number of times. Blood Shaman and Ox Demon were old rivals. Their combat methods were somewhat similar. They relied on their bodies to fight, but Blood Shaman had never been able to gain an advantage over Ox Demon.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, if the Holy Spirit Association manages to leave its name on the rankings, the influence it has on the Federation cannot be underestimated. It will be very disadvantageous for us,” Hermit said.</p>
<p>“They found Thief Sage ahead of us. Without a spatial expert at Thief Sage’s level, it will be very troublesome for us to enter the Venusian dimensional zone,” Cave Era said.</p>
<p>“Actually, we can use Jiuyue,” Hermit said.</p>
<p>“We would have used him if he could be used. Jiuyue has a good impression of the Holy Spirit Association. Although he’s a Guardian, he has always refused to join the League of Guardians. How can he be used? Do you dare use his services?” Cave Era said.</p>
<p>“There will be a way. Your Excellency, please leave this matter to me. I will definitely be able to make Jiuyue work for us.” Hermit requested Immortal’s permission.</p>
<p>Immortal said indifferently, “To clear the Venusian dimensional zone, one needs flawless cooperation.”</p>
<p>“I understand. I will definitely make Jiuyue willingly serve us.” Hermit understood what Immortal meant and promised.</p>
<p>As they spoke, Ox Demon had already destroyed six Golden Battle Gods with his own strength. It left everyone amazed.</p>
<p>However, everyone knew that this was only the beginning. What followed was the true test of the Holy Spirit Association’s strength. Not anyone could block a Calamity-grade bullet.</p>
<p>After the six Golden Battle Gods died, Ya led his team towards the door.</p>
<p>Fairy Peacock and True Martial flanked him, while Ox Demon walked behind. Liu Yun followed right at the back.</p>
<p>Everyone stared at Ya, wanting to know how he was going to block the Calamity-grade bullet.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>A gunshot sounded. When everyone saw it, they realized that Ya had already raised the Primordial Immortal Sword in front of him. Sparks flew as a bullet was blocked.</p>
<p>“How is this possible? He actually blocked it? How did he react?” Li Xuan, who was watching, gaped in shock.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also watching the battle. He pointed at Peacock Fairy and True Martial and said, “That’s not Ya’s strength alone. He has been augmented by the powers of the other two. They seem to have some kind of halo-like power.”</p>
<p>“I see. I wonder what power they augmented Ya with. It actually allowed Ya to react under such circumstances and even pull out his sword to block the bullet.” Li Xuan didn’t pay attention to Peacock Fairy and True Martial. After taking a careful look, he realized that they were responsible for the feat.</p>
<p>The average person couldn’t tell that Peacock Fairy and True Martial had played a major role. They just saw Ya quickly brandish his Primordial Immortal Sword, blocking three bullets.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, as expected of Ya. He’s too powerful. He feels even more powerful than those Calamity-grade creatures.”</p>
<p>“We have strong ones among us humans. He looks even more ferocious than the dwarf and Dragon Turtle.”</p>
<p>“This is too powerful. Could it be that Ya is already at the Calamity grade?”</p>
<p>While everyone praised the team, Zhang Chunqiu observed the cracks beneath True Martial’s feet and said lightly, “True Martial is a talent.”</p>
<p>“That Peacock Fairy is quite interesting.” Xia Liuchuan looked at the fan in Fairy Peacock’s hand with piqued interest.</p>
<p>The members of the League of Guardians didn’t look too good. It looked like the Holy Spirit Association had made ample preparations. Perhaps they could really leave their names on the rankings.</p>
<p>However, everyone knew that the seventh shot was the true test. Whether one could withstand the seventh shot was key to reaching the Golden Palace.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat worried for Zhong Ziya. He could naturally tell that Zhong Ziya was only at the Terror grade and hadn’t advanced to the Calamity grade. He had also designed a special skill combination to block the bullet. However, Zhou Wen didn’t know if this method was effective against the seventh bullet.</p>
<p>However, their battle gave Zhou Wen some hope.</p>
<p>The Calamity-grade creature kept firing at Ya, but it didn’t attack Peacock Fairy and True Martial. This meant that the creature still followed the same behavioral pattern as in-game. It would first kill creatures with higher levels and strength.</p>
<p>If that was the case in real life, his Companion Beasts like Grim Reaper No. 10 could be put to use. They could be used to block bullets at critical moments.</p>
<p>Of course, perhaps the creature was in a good mood and didn’t want to kill them all.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit Association members had already rushed into the tunnel. As they advanced, they blocked the bullets. Soon, they finished blocking the first six bullets.</p>
<p>Everyone held their breaths as their hearts raced uncontrollably. They were like criminals awaiting judgment. Regardless of whether they were friend or foe, all of them wanted to know if the Holy Spirit Association could block the critical seventh shot.</p>
<p>“It’s impossible to block the seventh sure-kill strike with a Terror-grade power. I’m afraid they’ll throw a life at it. I wonder who will die?” Hermit sneered.</p>
<p>Most of the people who knew the inside story had similar thoughts as Hermit. The seventh shot could only be neutered with death.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1287'>Chapter 1287: Blocking the Bullet</h3>
<p>“Although it’s said that throwing lives at the seventh shot can effectively mitigate it, not any random life can mitigate the offensive power of a Calamity-grade bullet. Even a Terror-grade life might not be able to meet the requirement. The power of a bullet will definitely not dissipate after a typical Terror-grade is killed. It still needs some special Terror-grade creature to fill this hole. From their abilities, Ox Demon should be the most suitable person to fill this hole,” said Blood Shaman.</p>
<p>“Ox Demon is part of the backbone of the Holy Spirit Association. To sacrifice Ox Demon for a ranking seems unlikely, right?” Cave Era said.</p>
<p>“It’s not impossible. The thing in the Venusian dimensional zone isn’t merely something Ox Demon can compare with,” said Blood Shaman.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>As they spoke, the seventh gunshot sounded. Everyone jolted and hurriedly looked at Ya and the others, wanting to know what the outcome would be. Who would block this shot with their lives?</p>
<p>When things turned clear for everyone, they realized that Ox Demon had appeared in front of Ya at some point in time. This outcome wasn’t unexpected.</p>
<p>No matter how one looked at it, Ox Demon seemed to be the best person to block the shot.</p>
<p>However, when people took a closer look, they couldn’t help but be alarmed. It was true that Ox Demon was standing in front of Ya, but he wasn’t hit by the seventh bullet. His body was completely unharmed.</p>
<p>And in front of Ox Demon, there was another creature.</p>
<p>The creature looked like a Guardian. It had a majestic body and was wearing resplendent heavy armor. Its limbs and body were chained, but one could no longer identify it since its head had been shattered by the bullet.</p>
<p>“That’s… Giant Armor God…” Cave Era stood up immediately and stared angrily at the screen. Her eyes nearly spewed out flames.</p>
<p>Giant Armor God was a rather important member of the League of Guardians. Unlike the Guardians that were sent through the Skysplit Tower, Giant Armor God was a Guardian that grew up on Earth. He was one of the few elites that could advance to the Terror grade. His status in the League of Guardians was second only to the four Heavenly Kings.</p>
<p>Even though his head had exploded, Cave Era still recognized Giant Armor God at a glance. The armor and powerful physique were not something ordinary people could imitate.</p>
<p>“Those bastards from the Holy Spirit Association!” Hermit’s eyes flashed with a cold glint. The Giant Armor God had always been in charge of the League of Guardians’ fieldwork. It had only been two to three days since he left the headquarters, but he had been captured by the Holy Spirit Association and used as a shield.</p>
<p>The Giant Armor God’s physique and defense weren’t inferior to Ox Demon’s. Although its overall strength wasn’t as strong as Ox Demon, it wasn’t that much weaker. Using him as a shield successfully nullified the seventh sure-kill bullet.</p>
<p>Ox Demon grabbed the Giant Armor God’s corpse with both hands and threw it to the side. Ya, Peacock Fairy, and company continued rushing towards the Golden Palace.</p>
<p>Another gunshot sounded. The might of the next bullet returned to the level of the first six shots. It was blocked by Ya’s Primordial Immortal Sword again.</p>
<p>As everyone charged in, they fended off the bullets. However, they were still a long way from the Golden Palace. The sixth shot of the second round was fired, spelling the dawn of the sure-kill seventh shot.</p>
<p>Giant Armor God was dead. Without any vitality or strength, it was impossible for him to block another shot even if his corpse was still around.</p>
<p>Without the Giant Armor God, who could withstand the seventh shot?</p>
<p>Everyone was guessing if the Holy Spirit Association had captured other Guardians or who would be used as a shield.</p>
<p>It wasn’t easy to find a powerful Guardian like the Giant Armor God. It was even harder to capture it. It was difficult to believe that the Holy Spirit Association could capture a second one.</p>
<p>The Golden Palace’s door was already in sight. It seemed a pity to give up now.</p>
<p>This concerned the ownership of the Venusian Companion Beast. No one would give up at this moment.</p>
<p>As long as they blocked the shot again, they could arrive in front of the Golden Palace. And among them, there was Ox Demon who could block the shot. His physique and abilities weren’t weaker than Giant Armor God and were perhaps even stronger. Since Giant Armor God could withstand the shot, Ox Demon could likely do the same.</p>
<p>Using an Ox Demon’s life to exchange for a chance of obtaining the Venusian Companion Beast seemed to be their only choice.</p>
<p>Ox Demon gritted his teeth and rushed in front of Ya again. He roared, “President, I’ll pave the way for you. I’ll use my life to exchange for the Holy Spirit Association’s chance to become the ruler of Earth. It’s worth it.”</p>
<p>“Without the people, what fun is there in ruling this world?” Ya said indifferently. He pressed his palm on Ox Demon’s shoulder and leaped up. He flew over Ox Demon’s head and, like an immortal riding a sword, transformed into a long beam that shot towards the Golden Palace’s door.</p>
<p>“No way. Although this speed is fast, it’s not as fast as the Calamity-grade bullet!”</p>
<p>“Just now, he used the power of Fairy Peacock and True Martial to block the first six bullets. Now, without the augmentation of Fairy Peacock and True Martial’s powers, he won’t be able to block ordinary Calamity-grade bullets, much less the seventh shot, right?”</p>
<p>“Although it’s very stupid and naive, I like such a person.”</p>
<p>“As expected of Ya. That man who fought the dimension alone. If he hadn’t been forcefully kicked out of the competition, Ya might have been able to obtain first place without Human Sovereign taking action.”</p>
<p>Everyone discussed spiritedly. Some were disdainful, some were contemptuous, and some were admirers. There were all sorts of emotions.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart was in his throat. He could naturally tell that Ya’s speed couldn’t allow him to reach the Golden Palace before the seventh shot hit him.</p>
<p>Even if he wanted to rush to Venus to save him, it was already too late.</p>
<p>After all, his teleportation skill wasn’t precise enough to teleport him directly into the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The sure-kill seventh shot sounded again, and Ya’s figure was at least a hundred meters away from the Golden Palace. This hundred meters was like an untraversable chasm.</p>
<p>Blocking the shot is impossible.</p>
<p>You have to survive!</p>
<p>Kill him!</p>
<p>Different people roared different thoughts in their hearts, hoping for different results.</p>
<p>Everyone’s attention was focused on Ya. Seeing Ya’s figure rapidly fall, the hearts of his supporters sank.</p>
<p>As for Ya’s head, it exploded. Even his body exploded.</p>
<p>Just as some people were overjoyed and some were sad and disappointed, they suddenly saw Ya’s figure appear in front of the Golden Palace’s door. He stood in front of the Golden Palace gates and casually held the Primordial Immortal Sword over his shoulder. The white trench coat imprinted with a black ‘Ya’ swayed with the shockwave as his long hair danced.</p>
<p>There weren’t many times when a man could be described as beautiful, but the present Ya was not only beautiful, but had a sort of wildness to him.</p>
<p>His wild and evil beauty was like a famous saber. It was beautiful and artistic, but it also made one unable to control their fear.</p>
<p>The Golden Palace’s door opened and a metal ball landed in Ya’s hand. The scene in the Cube also changed to a ranking. Ya’s name was shockingly on it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1288'>Chapter 1288: Immortal</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Ya’s name appeared in third place. It was a single Ya character, and behind Ya was a golden star.</p>
<p>“Ah! Only one star?”</p>
<p>“What are you fantasizing about? It’s not bad to have one star. Ignoring having a star, which human on Earth can clear the Venusian dimensional zone and make it onto the rankings?”</p>
<p>“Ya is so impressive. He can even go on the rankings like this. Two Calamity-grade creatures have already perished.”</p>
<p>“The Holy Spirit Association is invincible!”</p>
<p>The entire Federation’s Internet seemed to explode with furor. Everyone was discussing Ya’s appearance on the rankings, but Zhou Wen was somewhat worried.</p>
<p>Others might not be able to tell, but Zhou Wen could tell that Ya’s Substitute skill hadn’t been able to completely block the fatal shot. He was injured.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t know how bad Ya’s injuries were. With the Cube putting his name on the rankings, it meant that he wasn’t dead.</p>
<p>However, even if he wasn’t dead now, it didn’t mean that his injuries weren’t eventually fatal. Perhaps he just hadn’t died immediately.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was more worried that he wasn’t the only one who could tell that Ya was injured. If the League of Guardians could tell as well, Ya might not be able to return alive if they took the opportunity to pursue him.</p>
<p>Ya’s act of using Giant Armor God to block the shot had definitely infuriated the League of Guardians. It wasn’t impossible for the four Heavenly Kings and even the legendary Immortal to take action.</p>
<p>Although Liu Yun’s teleportation ability was amazing, it wasn’t easy to take someone to Venus.</p>
<p>Previously, when they went to Venus, Liu Yun could slowly send them there one by one. It wasn’t a problem for him to take a long time. No one knew that they were heading there ahead of time.</p>
<p>However, in this situation, the League of Guardians already knew that they were on Venus. It was impossible for them to immediately teleport back to Earth as a group. There was a high chance of being intercepted.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen only hoped that the League of Guardians didn’t have a way to quickly reach Venus.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen felt uneasy. After some thought, he summoned Jade Rabbit and got it to stay in Overseer Manor. Then, he left a Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping mark on a brick by the garden.</p>
<p>After doing all of this, Zhou Wen teleported to Venus. He was wearing the Dragon King armor.</p>
<p>The members of the Holy Spirit Association had just been sent out of the Venusian dimensional zone and appeared on the platform of the hemispherical metal building. Before they could leave, they saw a figure floating in the air and staring at them.</p>
<p>Others had yet to discover the figure above, but Zhong Ziya seemed to sense something as he looked up.</p>
<p>Everyone felt somewhat puzzled as they looked in the direction of Zhong Ziya’s gaze. They immediately discovered the figure floating there and warily gathered their strength to prepare for battle.</p>
<p>The figure’s armor was almost pure light. It was like the purest light in the world, crystallizing into an armor that enveloped his body.</p>
<p>His body flowed with a deity’s halo. His entire body seemed to be blessed by the gods. He was surrounded by halos, making him look holy and godlike.</p>
<p>He stood in midair and looked at Zhong Ziya without a word.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Ox Demon stared at the godlike figure and asked.</p>
<p>At that moment, the image of the rankings had ended. It returned to the scene outside the Venusian dimensional zone and people immediately saw the Holy Spirit Association’s group and the godlike figure.</p>
<p>Ox Demon’s question was what they wanted to know as well.</p>
<p>For such a figure to suddenly appear at this moment and block the Holy Spirit Association’s path, it was obvious that he had come for a reason.</p>
<p>However, the Holy Spirit Association had just entered the rankings and was in its prime. To dare provoke them at such a time, the person’s origins were probably not small.</p>
<p>The godlike figure didn’t answer Ox Demon. He continued looking at Zhong Ziya calmly.</p>
<p>The act of ignoring him immediately enraged Ox Demon. He gathered his strength and was about to leap up to strike the figure.</p>
<p>However, before he could move, Zhong Ziya pressed down on his shoulder.</p>
<p>“You are Immortal?” Zhong Ziya asked as he looked at the figure.</p>
<p>Everyone was alarmed when he said that. Almost everyone on Earth had heard of the League of Guardians’ Immortal, but only a few had actually seen him.</p>
<p>There were many rumors that Immortal was very likely a Calamity-grade Guardian.</p>
<p>“You have to pay the debt of Giant Armor God’s life.” The figure finally spoke. Although he didn’t directly admit it, it was equivalent to tacit agreement.</p>
<p>“How do I return it?” Zhong Ziya asked.</p>
<p>“Ten times,” Immortal said.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya smiled and said, “That’s really something we can’t repay. We only have five people here.”</p>
<p>“Don’t count me in. I’m not from the Holy Spirit Association. It has nothing to do with me. I was coerced by them,” Liu Yun hurriedly corrected.</p>
<p>“I’ll take five first. The remaining can be owed.” Immortal ignored Liu Yun and still counted him, leaving Liu Yun depressed.</p>
<p>“Additional debt doesn’t matter once it reaches a certain threshold. Since it can be owed, why not keep it that way for the entire debt?” Zhong Ziya said.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid that’s not possible.” Immortal’s voice didn’t have any change in emotion. It was like a robot.</p>
<p>“Return now. I’ll have a good chat with this Immortal,” Zhong Ziya ordered Ox Demon and company.</p>
<p>Just as Ox Demon and company were about to accept the order, they heard Immortal say, “Your injuries are too serious. You no longer have the ability to fight. Your life is mine. Likewise for the rest. Leave your lives behind.”</p>
<p>“President!” Ox Demon and company were alarmed as they looked at Zhong Ziya in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Is this little trick enough to make you lose your sense of propriety?” Zhong Ziya held the Primordial Immortal Sword and pointed it at Immortal. At the same time, he said indifferently, “Do what’s required of you. Immortal of the League of Guardians, I’ve long wanted to see what tricks you have.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, the sword intent on the Primordial Immortal Sword surged. It was unimaginably terrifying.</p>
<p>“Old Ox, it’s just a Guardian. It’s not worth it for the president to personally take action. Just take him down.” Peacock Fairy, who had not said anything, suddenly spoke.</p>
<p>At the same time, she patted Ox Demon with one hand as a force immediately injected into his body.</p>
<p>Ox Demon was slightly taken aback. On the other side, True Martial also patted his other shoulder. Another strange force was injected into his body.</p>
<p>Although Ox Demon wasn’t as smart as Fairy Peacock, he immediately understood something when he saw her and True Martial’s actions. Without looking at Zhong Ziya, he gathered his strength and tore through the air to attack Immortal.</p>
<p>Ox Demon knew very well that Fairy Peacock and True Martial’s loyalty to Zhong Ziya was no less than his. It was absolutely impossible for them to disobey Zhong Ziya’s orders, unless it was as Immortal had said—Zhong Ziya had been severely injured.</p>
<p>With the augmentation of Fairy Peacock and True Martial, Ox Demon’s strength and speed were pushed to unimaginable heights.. The power he emitted was like a destructive meteor that struck at Immortal.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1289'>Chapter 1289: Godlike</h3>
<p>The might of this punch was so powerful that it probably exceeded the limits of the Terror grade. Its pure strength caused space to tremble and warp.</p>
<p>Not only was the punch terrifying, but it was also unbelievably fast. It approached the speed of light.</p>
<p>“The powers of Fairy Peacock and True Martial are really useful. They can actually raise Ox Demon’s strength to such a level. Although they aren’t comparable to a Calamity-grade, they aren’t too far off,” Xia Liuchuan exclaimed.</p>
<p>Before he could say anything else, Xia Liuchuan’s mouth gaped open.</p>
<p>Ox Demon’s terrifying punch missed.</p>
<p>What was ridiculous was that Immortal stood there without moving. Ox Demon’s punch flew past the side of his face without touching Immortal.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, he can’t even hit him. They must be in cahoots. Could Ox Demon be a spy planted by the League of Guardians in the Holy Spirit Association?”</p>
<p>“Ox Demon is definitely a traitor. His acting sucks.”</p>
<p>“Bro, can you put in more effort in your acting?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Even an expert like Xia Liuchuan was somewhat puzzled as to why Ox Demon’s punch missed.</p>
<p>They had thought of ten thousand possibilities prior to this, even considering the possibility of Ox Demon being suppressed by Immortal with one finger, but they never expected Ox Demon to miss.</p>
<p>Following that, something even more ridiculous happened. Ox Demon’s punches came one after another. Even half a planet would probably be destroyed by his crazy bombardment.</p>
<p>However, Immortal was completely fine. Even his hair didn’t stir. All of Ox Demon’s attacks and his violent fists brushed past Immortal as though he had deliberately missed.</p>
<p>At that moment, anyone could tell that something was amiss. The power in Ox Demon’s fist wasn’t fake, nor was it acting. It looked like he just couldn’t hit his target.</p>
<p>However, Immortal had never moved. How could he not be able to hit him?</p>
<p>Everyone felt that Ox Demon should be able to hit him, but every punch he threw with all his might missed. It was as though he had deliberately avoided Immortal.</p>
<p>“Legend has it that saints have the protection of the heavens. All Dharma can’t touch them. Could it be that Immortal of the League of Guardians is already powerful enough to be considered a saint?” Xia Liuchuan muttered to himself as he looked at the godlike Immortal.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if he’s a saint, but this power is really terrifying. It makes the opponent completely unable to hit him. This power is very similar to one of the legendary powers of our Zhang family, but no one in the Zhang family has mastered it,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“What power?” Xia Liuchuan asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Evil Annihilation Retreat,” Zhang Chunqiu answered.</p>
<p>On the Cube, Immortal finally moved. He raised his hand but didn’t move quickly. He pressed his thumb to his middle finger and flicked Ox Demon’s head.</p>
<p>Ox Demon’s eyes were filled with horror as he attacked with all his might. However, his attacks still seemed to deliberately avoid Immortal. He didn’t even touch Immortal’s clothes.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Immortal’s middle finger flicked Ox Demon’s forehead, sending him flying like a cannonball. He slammed into Venus, creating a huge crater in the rocky ground.</p>
<p>The shockwave constantly tumbled out like a nuclear blast.</p>
<p>After the blast passed, people saw Ox Demon’s mighty body. He had collapsed inside the rock pit, his body contorted. His forehead had caved in, and his body was covered in blood.</p>
<p>Struggling, Ox Demon barely managed to get up from the pit. After taking two steps, he staggered and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Everyone fell silent. Such a powerful Ox Demon failed to even withstand Immortal’s finger strike. He was already half-dead.</p>
<p>“Thief Sage, take the president away now.” Fairy Peacock and True Martial rushed in front of Zhong Ziya and shielded him behind them as they shouted at Liu Yun.</p>
<p>However, just as they finished speaking, they suddenly realized that Immortal, who had been far away in midair, had appeared in front of them at some point in time. His eyes were less than a foot away from theirs.</p>
<p>Pa! Pa!</p>
<p>Immortal extended his hand and slapped Fairy Peacock and True Martial in the face. The two of them immediately flew out like cannonballs. Their faces contorted as they slammed into the ground, creating two deep ravines that were thousands of meters long.</p>
<p>Pfft!</p>
<p>True Martial struggled to get up. His head was covered in blood and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>
<p>On the other side, Peacock Fairy was in an even worse state. There was no movement from her under the rubble. It was unknown if she was dead or alive.</p>
<p>In an instant, the three core members of the Holy Spirit Association, who had accompanied Ya to rush to the top of the rankings, appeared so weak that they were easily beaten by Immortal.</p>
<p>“How powerful!” Everyone felt their scalps tingle. The power of Immortal carried an overbearingness that made it difficult for others to resist.</p>
<p>“He’s a Calamity-grade, right?”</p>
<p>“I think he’s more like a god. An omnipotent god.”</p>
<p>“Nothing less expected of a god’s possession. Even an enemy’s attack will automatically avoid him. What a miracle!”</p>
<p>Ordinary people were amazed, but those who wanted to liberate themselves from the League of Guardians’ rule felt heavy emotions after seeing the horror of Immortal.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was alarmed as well. He gritted his teeth and instant transmitted behind Zhong Ziya, about to teleport away from Venus with him.</p>
<p>However, before he could touch Zhong Ziya, the Primordial Immortal Sword in Zhong Ziya’s hand was already at his throat, forcing Liu Yun to stop.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? I’m helping you,” Liu Yun shouted angrily.</p>
<p>“Find an opportunity to take them away,” Zhong Ziya said as he stared at Immortal. The Primordial Immortal Sword in his hand and his body emitted an unimaginably terrifying sword intent.</p>
<p>His aura constantly rose, almost no weaker than Immortal’s. However, at his chest, the white robe gradually turned blood-red. The blood-red flower bloomed on the white robe like a flower. Clearly, there was constant bleeding underneath.</p>
<p>“He’s indeed injured. Even with the Substitute technique, it’s not that easy to dodge the seventh sure-kill shot,” Zhang Chunqiu sighed as though he had noticed the problem long ago.</p>
<p>“If he wasn’t injured, he might really be able to fight Immortal. Now, I’m afraid he can at most risk his life to stall for time. I just don’t know how long he can last.” Xia Liuchuan shook his head.</p>
<p>Immortal looked at Zhong Ziya, whose chest was already blood-red, and said, “If you continue, I don’t need to do anything. That injury will take your life. I don’t like people I wish to kill dying in front of me.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Then accompany me to hell to see the scenery there.” Zhong Ziya ignored everything and continued releasing the remaining energy in his body, about to give up on suppressing his injuries.</p>
<p>“Sirs, do you need a fighter substitute service?” A voice suddenly sounded.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1290'>Chapter 1290: Based on Honesty and Integrity</h3>
<p>“Looter King? What’s he doing here? Doesn’t he only like to pick up scraps? Is there anything for him to loot here?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you hear him say that he wants to be a fighter substitute?”</p>
<p>“Fighter substitute? How does that work? Who is he substituting? Fight the League of Guardians in place of the Holy Spirit Association?”</p>
<p>“Is he crazy? He actually wants to take advantage of such a situation? Isn’t he afraid that he won’t have the life to spend the money he earns? Ignoring the fact that he can fight the terrifying, godlike Immortal, even if he can, will he have a peaceful life after offending the League of Guardians?”</p>
<p>“So what if it’s the League of Guardians? If even Immortal is defeated, who in the League of Guardians can touch him? They will only be throwing themselves at death.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The person who appeared on Venus was naturally Zhou Wen. However, he didn’t wish to participate in the battle between the League of Guardians and the Holy Spirit Association with his personal identity to prevent the League of Guardians from targeting his family. Although he wasn’t afraid, it would be very troublesome. It was better to save the trouble.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen appeared in the middle of Immortal and Ya, seemingly both unintentionally and intentionally. It made the battle that was about to break out between them calm down slightly as the auras on both sides converged.</p>
<p>“Looter King, are you also a member of the Holy Spirit Association?” Immortal said with a frown.</p>
<p>Back when Zhou Wen used his sword to block the seventh Calamity-grade bullet, even Immortal didn’t dare belittle him.</p>
<p>“Of course not. I’ve always been a loner. I never share my earnings with others, so how can I join an organization to split the money with others? Now that I’m providing fighter substitute services, I wonder if you are interested in my services. My prices begin at a Mythical Companion Egg,” Zhou Wen said, having changed his voice.</p>
<p>Immortal didn’t say a word as he looked at Zhou Wen. He was already confident of victory, so he naturally didn’t need Zhou Wen to fight on his behalf. However, if he said that he didn’t need him, the Holy Spirit Association, which was in a very disadvantageous situation, would definitely need such a strong ally.</p>
<p>The problem was that Immortal didn’t know the origins of Looter King. Perhaps he was a member of the Holy Spirit Association and was only pretending.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. Think about it carefully.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he looked at Zhong Ziya and asked, “President, do you need a fighter substitute service? The price is fair and honest.”</p>
<p>“What’s the price?” Zhong Ziya didn’t retract his sword as he asked coldly.</p>
<p>“That depends on who you want me to fight,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That irritating fellow opposite me,” Zhong Ziya said.</p>
<p>“That’s a major figure from the League of Guardians. He’s very powerful,” Zhou Wen said, seemingly afraid.</p>
<p>“You don’t dare to accept the job?” Zhong Ziya asked again.</p>
<p>“I’ll accept it as long as I’m paid, but the price definitely won’t be cheap,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Name your price,” Zhong Ziya said again.</p>
<p>“I just started business today. I’ll give you a reasonable price, so don’t haggle. A Terror-grade Companion Egg. Service is rendered after payment,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Deal.” Zhong Ziya extended his hand and threw a Companion Egg at Zhou Wen. “Terror-grade Flaming Monarch, you can check the goods first.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need. I trust the president of the Holy Spirit Association.” Zhou Wen caught the Companion Egg and stroked it lovingly.</p>
<p>“Now that you’ve taken my Companion Egg, it’s time to work,” Zhong Ziya said.</p>
<p>“No rush.” Zhou Wen held the Companion Egg and turned to Immortal. “Lord Immortal, as you can see, President Ya spent a Terror-grade Companion Egg to get me to fight for him. If you think the price of a Companion Egg is too low, you can offer a higher price. I’ll help you beat him up.”</p>
<p>“F*ck, he’s too shameless. This fellow actually raised the price so brazenly.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by raising the price? This is called extortion, alright?”</p>
<p>“Looter King is too shameless. He doesn’t have any professional ethics.”</p>
<p>“There are benefits to being shameless. Look at him. He has already obtained a Terror-grade Companion Egg. At the very least, he can earn a Terror-grade Companion Egg. I’m afraid we won’t have the chance to encounter such a high-grade item in our lives. He earned it with just a few words. I call that skill.”</p>
<p>“Although he’s capable, he’s really too shameless.”</p>
<p>As people discussed, Immortal looked at Zhou Wen and said without any fluctuations in his voice, “How do I know that you will definitely work for me after taking my payment?”</p>
<p>“I’ll do the work for whoever gives me the most benefits. However, don’t worry. I have my professional ethics. As long as I receive benefits, I’ll definitely do the work. If I can’t do it, I’ll refund it in full. I guarantee it with my reputation. Otherwise, I’ll be struck by lightning and die without a complete corpse…” Zhou Wen swore as though he was serious.</p>
<p>“I don’t have a Terror-grade Companion Egg. There’s a Terror-grade skill crystal here. It’s produced by a spatial creature, Void Bird. It’s definitely a spatial skill. Its value is above the Flaming Monarch,” Immortal said as he took out a skill crystal.</p>
<p>When people heard the name Void Bird, they were immediately taken aback.</p>
<p>Void Bird came from overseas. It was said to be a bird that never landed on the ground. It soared above the sea all its life. Furthermore, it was said that Void Bird had the ability to travel to the future. Wherever it appeared, there was a high possibility of a huge storm happening the next day. Therefore, Void Bird was known as the Bird of Prophecy or the Bird of Calamity.</p>
<p>Although there were also people who wanted to hunt the Void Bird, it was a top-notch spatial creature. Its ability to traverse space was extremely strong. Several bigwigs overseas ultimately failed at capturing the Void Bird.</p>
<p>Since Immortal had produced a skill crystal of the Void Bird, it naturally meant that he had killed one.</p>
<p>“It’s good stuff, but it’s only at the same level after all. The Flaming Monarch Companion Egg isn’t much worse. Why don’t you top it up a little more?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Take it if you want it. If not, do the work,” Immortal said calmly.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll take this job. Services are rendered after payment,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Immortal expressionlessly threw the skill crystal to Zhou Wen and looked coldly at him to see what he was up to.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen caught the crystal and stroked it twice before putting it away. He looked at Immortal and asked, “Lord Immortal, don’t worry. Now that I’ve taken payment, I’ll definitely help you settle the matter. I’ll definitely beat him to the ground and make him unable to get up. What do you think?”</p>
<p>“Good,” Immortal answered.</p>
<p>After receiving an affirmative answer, Zhou Wen turned to Zhong Ziya and said, “President Ya, you heard it too. The other party’s price is higher than yours. Why don’t you raise it?”</p>
<p>“I’m not gonna top up. Return the Companion Egg to me,” Zhong Ziya said as he extended his hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen instantly put away the Flaming Monarch Companion Egg and said with a smile, “How can I return it to you after closing the deal?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhong Ziya frowned.</p>
<p>It wasn’t only Zhong Ziya. Everyone was stunned, unsure what Zhou Wen was up to.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued with a smile, “After receiving your benefits, I’ll naturally help you beat up that Lord Immortal. However, I’ve also received something good from Lord Immortal. Furthermore, the benefits he gives me are better than yours, so I must beat you up first. After I’m done beating you up, I’ll beat him up. It doesn’t matter. I’m a person who values integrity the most. I’m based on honesty and integrity. I guarantee satisfaction to all my employers for all closed transactions.”</p>
<p>Everyone’s jaws dropped. They were stunned for a long time.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1291'>Chapter 1291: Sword Against Two Bigwigs</h3>
<p>“A scam… This is too much of a f*cking scam… He wants to scam both sides…”</p>
<p>“Isn’t he afraid that he will bite off more than he can chew? At the same time, he’ll be offending both the League of Guardians and the Holy Spirit Association. Can he still survive on Earth in the future?”</p>
<p>“He’s already on Venus. There’s no need for him to stay on Earth.”</p>
<p>“This isn’t about being shameless anymore. It’s a scam!”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me he really wants to defeat the president of the Holy Spirit Association and Lord Immortal of the League of Guardians at the same time?”</p>
<p>“In any case, I don’t believe it. That’s too ridiculous. Ignoring Ya’s injuries, that Immortal is like a god. It’s hard to say if he can defeat him.”</p>
<p>When people came to a realization of what was happening, the Internet immediately broke out into a furor. All sorts of messages kept appearing as the scrolling text on the screen overlapped layer by layer. It made it impossible to read the messages.</p>
<p>“Impressive… Really impressive… To be able to claim that he’s honest despite scamming both sides… I’m not as thick-skinned as him…” Liu Yun sighed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already moved and instantly charged at Ya like a phantom.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the Son of Heaven’s Sword with both hands and slashed at Ya.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen wanted to help Ya, he couldn’t give others the impression that he was a member of the Holy Spirit Association because of him aiding Ya. He also couldn’t have others make the connection that Looter King was Zhou Wen, so he had tried his best to craft an image of Looter King.</p>
<p>Thankfully, due to the matter of him picking up items in the Venusian dimensional zone, Looter King’s reputation wasn’t that good to begin with. It was very easy for people to accept his current image.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The Primordial Immortal Sword in Ya’s hand blocked Zhou Wen’s Son of Heaven’s Sword, but due to his serious injuries, the strength he accumulated had begun to decline. How could he be Zhou Wen’s match? He was sent flying by the strike.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen showed no mercy as the Son of Heaven’s Sword in his hand slashed at Ya like a tempest.</p>
<p>Ya held Primordial Immortal Sword and fought Zhou Wen with all his might, but his injuries were just too serious. Blood constantly flowed out of his chest. The bleeding was secondary; the injuries caused by the Calamity-grade bullet had weakened his vitality. His strength and speed naturally began to weaken.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Ya’s body exploded from Zhou Wen’s strike, turning into a shattered puppet.</p>
<p>Ya couldn’t withstand Zhou Wen’s attack and could only use Substitute.</p>
<p>This was only an ordinary Substitute Skill. It was different from the Substitute he used to block the seventh Calamity shot. The Substitute that blocked the seventh Calamity shot was an Intrinsic Substitute of his. It was different from ordinary one-time Substitutes.</p>
<p>Ordinary Substitutes could block the first six shots, but it was impossible for them to block the fatal seventh shot. Although the Intrinsic Substitute could block the seventh shot, it only did so barely. It had even left Ya seriously injured.</p>
<p>If it were anyone else, Ya’s Substitute spell would be very useful, but Zhou Wen also knew the Substitute spell very well. He knew how to draw Substitute Talismans himself. Although his wasn’t as powerful as Ya’s Substitute spell, it followed the same principle.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen knew the minute signs of the Substitute spell. When Ya used Substitute Puppet again, Zhou Wen circled around it and instantly appeared in front of Ya. The Son of Heaven’s Sword stabbed into his chest like a bolt of lightning, piercing through his already injured chest.</p>
<p>Then, he sent Ya flying with a kick. Blood spewed out of Ya’s chest as his body flew out and slammed into Venus. It left a huge crater in the ground like a meteor.</p>
<p>Everyone was dumbfounded. They never expected the Looter King to be so straightforward. He attacked as he pleased. The dignified president of the Holy Spirit Association had been beaten to a pulp in the blink of an eye. From the looks of his injuries, it was unlikely he could survive.</p>
<p>“President…” Ox Demon struggled to get to his feet in a bid to fight Zhou Wen to the death, but his injuries were too serious. After taking a few steps, he fell to the ground and again tried his best to get up. He looked at Zhou Wen as though he wanted to eat him alive.</p>
<p>True Martial struggled to stand up, but when he saw Ya’s penetrated chest, he spat out a mouthful of blood and fainted from anger.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was also dumbfounded. He never expected Zhou Wen to be ruthless to the point of killing Zhong Ziya.</p>
<p>However, Liu Yun felt that something was amiss. He frowned and fell silent.</p>
<p>“Lord Immortal, are you satisfied with my work?” Zhou Wen turned around and flew towards Immortal as he asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“Not bad,” Immortal said.</p>
<p>“As long as you’re satisfied. Now that I’ve completed the deal with you, it’s time to complete the deal with President Ya. I’m a person who values integrity the most. I’ll definitely do a good job once I accept the deal. Don’t blame me,” Zhou Wen said as he thrust the Son of Heaven’s Sword at Immortal.</p>
<p>His strike was somewhat different from the sword technique he had used in the battle with Ya.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already noticed something from Immortal’s battle with Ox Demon. Immortal was also a spatial-type expert. Even if he didn’t employ a pure spatial-type Essence Energy Art, he at least had spatial-type abilities.</p>
<p>Ox Demon failed to touch Immortal despite his terrifying punch. It looked like he had taken the initiative to avoid Immortal.</p>
<p>In fact, that wasn’t the case. Zhou Wen, who was rather proficient in spatial powers, knew that it wasn’t that Ox Demon had avoided Immortal, but that Immortal had used spatial powers to distort the space around him. It looked like Ox Demon had avoided him, but in fact, space had changed the direction in which he hit.</p>
<p>To be able to do so, Immortal’s spatial powers were rather terrifying. However, his spatial powers clearly went in a different direction from Zhou Wen and Liu Yun’s.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen stabbed out, the Son of Heaven’s Sword already contained the power of the Singularity Universe which pinpointed Immortal’s location. Even if he distorted space, he couldn’t change the final destination of the Son of Heaven’s Sword.</p>
<p>After the Son of Heaven’s Sword approached Immortal, it looked like it followed the same deviant trajectory as Ox Demon.</p>
<p>However, when fighting Ox Demon, Immortal—who stood there and allowed Ox Demon to attack him without moving—moved because of Zhou Wen’s strike. He dodged Zhou Wen’s strike by moving to the side.</p>
<p>“Looter King is really strong. He’s not just capable of looting treasures. Ox Demon had attacked so many times, but not once did he force Immortal to move. Just one strike from Looter King has forced Immortal to dodge. This is the difference.”</p>
<p>“Who is this Looter King? Why was there no sign of him before? It’s as though he jumped out from a crack in a rock. Isn’t he too strong?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Anyway, among the humans I know, other than Human Sovereign, this Looter King is the strongest.”</p>
<p>As people discussed, Zhou Wen had fully unleashed his sword technique. Like a surging heavenly river, it slashed at Immortal.</p>
<p>Immortal’s figure was elegant as he calmly dodged Zhou Wen’s attack. Zhou Wen’s sword technique failed to touch the corner of his clothes, but under the pressure of Zhou Wen’s sword technique, Immortal also failed to find a chance to counterattack.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1292'>Chapter 1292: Battle Against Immortal</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Heart Defying Sword followed his true desires. It wasn’t limited to one concept. People wouldn’t be able to recognize it even when he delivered a random strike.</p>
<p>At that moment, the sword intent Zhou Wen used was like a surging river. When he stabbed out, the subsequent sword combos were endless. With the Singularity Universe’s spatial power pinpointing Immortal, Immortal’s spatial distortion lost its effect. All he could do was fight Zhou Wen head-on.</p>
<p>Immortal’s movement technique was also extremely amazing. The seemingly unintentional subtle movement seemed to contain many unexpected and magical aspects, preventing Zhou Wen from touching him.</p>
<p>The sword missed again. With a thought, Zhou Wen threw the Son of Heaven’s Sword out of his hand.</p>
<p>Immortal dodged the strike and had already arrived at a spot that made it difficult to dodge another. Seeing the sudden appearance of the Son of Heaven’s Sword, he had no time to dodge. All he could do was extend his hand and slap the Son of Heaven’s Sword.</p>
<p>Just as Immortal’s palm was about to slap the Son of Heaven’s Sword, the sword suddenly transformed into Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen struck out at Immortal’s palm as his other hand clenched into a fist that struck at his waist.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s palm clashed with Immortal’s palm as his fist was blocked by Immortal’s other hand, producing a dull thud.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt as though his fist and palm had struck a resilient rubber ball and his strength was sharply reduced.</p>
<p>On careful look, Zhou Wen realized that his palm and fist hadn’t touched Immortal’s body. The halo, which resembled a god’s protection, had blocked Zhou Wen’s punch and completely dispelled the powerful punch like a spring.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s hands didn’t stop as they turned into a barrage of attacks that he constantly threw at Immortal.</p>
<p>Although the halo over Immortal’s body could withstand Zhou Wen’s punches, Immortal continued blocking Zhou Wen’s moves. He didn’t let down his guard.</p>
<p>Pa!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only attacked without defending. He attacked crazily as though he was punching a sandbag, pouring all his strength into Immortal.</p>
<p>When the average person watched this, it was as though Zhou Wen had the upper hand, suppressing Immortal and forcing him to retreat repeatedly. They were alarmed by how powerful Looter King was.</p>
<p>However, the true experts among humans wore looks of puzzlement. Although Zhou Wen’s attacks were ferocious, he had too many flaws because he had abandoned defense and focused on the offense.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen couldn’t really break through Immortal’s defense. As long as Immortal ignored Zhou Wen’s attack and targeted his weakness in a counterattack, Zhou Wen would definitely be in a tragic state.</p>
<p>However, Immortal didn’t counterattack. He continued defending with an airtight defense.</p>
<p>“What are these two doing? One is attacking with all his might, while the other is defending with all his might.” Xia Xuanyue looked at Xia Liuchuan and asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>She also felt that Looter King was in a very disadvantageous situation, but for some reason, Immortal didn’t counterattack.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan said, “Any counterattack from Immortal is built on the fact that Looter King can’t break through his defense, but Looter King has been deliberately showing him his flaws as though he’s telling him, ‘Come on, hit me. I’ve a hidden skill that can break through your defense.’ This way, Immortal won’t dare to act rashly.”</p>
<p>“Then, can Looter King break through Immortal’s defense?” Xia Xuanyue asked.</p>
<p>“Who knows? Perhaps he can. Perhaps he’s just bluffing. Apart from Looter King himself, I’m afraid no one knows,” Xia Liuchuan said as he spread out his hands.</p>
<p>The duo was very patient. Immortal was really like an otherworldly immortal. No matter how Zhou Wen seduced him or revealed flaws, he didn’t counterattack or give Zhou Wen any chance.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was even worse. If Immortal didn’t counterattack, he would go all in when it came to offense and expose more flaws.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the average person, Zhou Wen was like a demonic god that had descended to the mortal world. He suppressed Immortal and beat him back repeatedly.</p>
<p>“Looter King is amazing. He has completely suppressed Lord Immortal.”</p>
<p>“The virtue is one foot tall, the devil ten feet. Immortal is still not as powerful as the devil.”</p>
<p>“Looter King should be a human. What has he got to do with devils?”</p>
<p>“We can’t see his true appearance. Who knows if he’s pure human. Even if he is a pure human, with his actions, he can be considered a devil. It’s not too much to call him a devil.”</p>
<p>“Speaking of which, the nickname ‘Looter King’ doesn’t seem to suit him. In the past, I only felt that he was picking up scraps, but from the looks of it, he’s terrifyingly powerful. Even Lord Immortal is being suppressed by him. Such strength is basically invincible on Earth, right?”</p>
<p>“The words ‘Looter King’ are indeed a little inappropriate.”</p>
<p>“But this fellow’s actions don’t make him appear like a proper person. Titles like god or saint don’t seem to suit him.”</p>
<p>Everyone discussed spiritedly. Zhou Wen’s domineering performance broadened the horizons of the average person.</p>
<p>Seeing how the godlike Immortal—who had crushed the Holy Spirit Association—was being suppressed by Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen’s standing in everyone’s hearts seemed to elevate.</p>
<p>However, his previous actions made it impossible for people to respect him like Human Sovereign.</p>
<p>The host and Professor Gu, who were livestreaming, were also discussing this problem. Professor Gu said, “This person is indeed very strong. He doesn’t rely on luck, but his thoughts are a little different from ordinary people. It’s quite odd. To call him Looter King is definitely wrong. He relies on true talent, but to call him a god or saint doesn’t seem right either.”</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, Professor Gu added, “His style of doing things is somewhat similar to Thief Sage. Why don’t we call him Deceit Sage in the future?”</p>
<p>“Deceit Sage? This name sounds a little indecent,” the host said with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>“A deceptive person might not be a thief. Those who steal the hearts of others and plunder countries are considered deceptive. Since ancient times, there have been instances of decent deception. Although this person can’t be described as decent, it shouldn’t be too much to call him a deceptive person, right?” Professor Gu said with a smile.</p>
<p>The host muttered, “His actions don’t seem to match a sage’s. He’s more like a Deceit King.”</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Deceit King quickly became popular and became a new nickname that Zhou Wen was widely known as.</p>
<p>As everyone spoke, something finally changed on the battlefield. Under Zhou Wen’s constant pressure, Immortal finally attacked a flaw that Zhou Wen revealed.</p>
<p>The flaw was too great. Immortal’s hand reached at Zhou Wen’s abdomen in an incredulous manner. It was like a straight knife that wanted to stab into his abdomen and rip it open.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Wen, he had no intention of retreating or defending. In fact, it was too late to defend. He had used too much force in his attacks.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s palm struck Immortal’s head at the same time, hoping to shatter it. It was as though he was determined to succeed with that single strike.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was ultimately one step behind. Immortal’s palm was about to pierce through his abdomen—even if Zhou Wen had the ability to break through Immortal’s defense, it was probably useless.</p>
<p>Just as Immortal’s finger was about to touch Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen’s body transformed into the Son of Heaven’s Sword. As for Zhou Wen, he appeared where the Son of Heaven’s Sword was.</p>
<p>Immortal’s reaction was extremely fast. Just as his finger was about to collide with the tip of the sword, he changed from stabbing to grabbing and grabbed the Son of Heaven’s Sword.</p>
<p>However, when he grabbed something firm, he realized that he was grabbing Zhou Wen’s arm. The Son of Heaven’s Sword had vanished again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s other palm struck Immortal’s head. At this close distance, Immortal couldn’t dodge in time and was struck in the head.</p>
<p>However, at that moment, Immortal revealed a strange smile.</p>

<h3 id='chapter1293'>Chapter 1293: Immortal Break</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>When Zhou Wen’s palm touched the armor on Immortal’s head, an unbelievable scene happened. Their bodies strangely swapped.</p>
<p>This swapping didn’t refer to exchanging bodies, but their positions.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s palm had originally struck the top of Immortal’s head, but Immortal was already powerless to dodge. However, now, Zhou Wen was standing in Immortal’s original spot, while Immortal appeared in Zhou Wen’s spot.</p>
<p>Even their actions were identical. Zhou Wen stood there with his hands far from his head. As for Immortal’s palm, it had already struck Zhou Wen’s head.</p>
<p>Everyone felt their hearts turn cold. Immortal was also proficient in the art of swapping. It was very similar to Zhou Wen’s Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping. However, his swapping was done together with his opponent. Therefore, it was somewhat different from Zhou Wen’s Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping.</p>
<p>As everything had happened too suddenly, it was too late for Zhou Wen to use Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping. Immortal’s palm had already pressed down on his head.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Immortal slapped down, but he realized that he had struck the Son of Heaven’s Sword that had been swapped. He sent the Son of Heaven’s Sword flying and couldn’t help but be alarmed.</p>
<p>As Immortal was proficient in similar techniques, he knew that this swapping technique needed to be prepared ahead of time. Zhou Wen had clearly made such preparations to be able to swap the Son of Heaven’s Sword.</p>
<p>Immortal’s expression changed slightly. If all of this had been within Zhou Wen’s calculations, he would be in danger.</p>
<p>Just as Immortal was about to move, he felt an intense pain coming from the back of his head. His head felt like it had exploded as his body involuntarily fell forward.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Wen, despite being clearly far away, he had swapped to the spot where the Son of Heaven’s Sword had been, but an invisible avatar seemed to strike the back of Immortal’s head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had actually used Spacetime Bandit to produce a delayed Ashen Palm.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>After Immortal switched to Zhou Wen’s position and attacked him, he naturally took Zhou Wen’s spot, just in time to be hit by the delayed Ashen Palm in the back of his head.</p>
<p>Despite all his calculations, he was still one step short—he was struck by Ashen Palm. The strange force penetrated the halo and helmet around him and nearly burst his brain.</p>
<p>This was only because Zhou Wen’s Ashen Palm was only at the Mythical stage. Although it contained the power of the Terror-grade Singularity Universe, it was ultimately lacking. Otherwise, this strike might really have wrecked Immortal’s brain.</p>
<p>Ashen Palm was a skill that Zhou Wen had often used in his early days, but with more powerful skills, he seldom used it. His level had risen to the Mythical stage without any special cultivation.</p>
<p>Even so, the extremely soft characteristic of Ashen Palm could still help some of Singularity Universe’s powers penetrate Immortal’s defenses.</p>
<p>All of this was a wordy description, but it all happened in a split second. The Terror-grade experts could still see the gist of it. The ordinary humans only saw Zhou Wen strike Immortal’s head before Immortal was sent flying.</p>
<p>Just as Immortal was sent flying, Zhou Wen instant transmitted over and unleashed a barrage of attacks at Immortal. He wanted to strike while he was down.</p>
<p>With Immortal’s brain injured, it was probably difficult for him to react. This was the best opportunity to kill him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was right. Unless a creature didn’t need a brain to think, once their brain was severely damaged, death was basically certain in such a battle. Having thoughts and becoming demented weren’t even needed in the picture.</p>
<p>However, Immortal actually endured the pain in his brain and reacted instinctively.</p>
<p>Although he couldn’t block all of Zhou Wen’s attacks, he protected his head, preventing Zhou Wen from hitting it again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen struck Immortal on the arm, sending him flying again. His other palm struck his chest as he instant transmitted again and repeatedly struck him in midair.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen struck the godlike, haloed Immortal again and again, sending him flying as he spewed out blood.</p>
<p>The final palm strike made Immortal disappear. It was as if it had struck Immortal into nothingness. Immortal disappeared just like that.</p>
<p>People stared blankly at the Cube’s screen, momentarily at a loss as to how to react.</p>
<p>Of the two strongest factions on Earth, the Holy Spirit Association and the League of Guardians, the former’s president had his heart pierced through by Zhou Wen. It was unknown if he was dead or alive. The League of Guardians’ Lord Immortal had also been reduced to nothingness.</p>
<p>“He’s so f*cking strong!” It was unknown who said this, but this sentence became the most commonly used adjective to describe experts in the future.</p>
<p>The title of Deceit King also officially resounded across Earth and the dimension.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally knew that he hadn’t been able to kill Immortal in the end. Under such circumstances, Immortal instinctively protected his vital spots. When he was capable of thinking, he used a void mystic technique to escape.</p>
<p>What a powerful fellow. Zhou Wen marveled inwardly. If he encountered Immortal again, the same move would definitely be useless.</p>
<p>This time, it was Immortal’s miscalculation. It was also because he didn’t know that Zhou Wen was adept at Spacetime Bandit. It would be impossible for him to injure Immortal again the next time he used it.</p>
<p>I have to practice Ashen Palm well. If there’s a chance in the future, I’ll smack him into an idiot. In comparison, I still like harmless idiots, not smart people. Without sparing the Holy Spirit Association on Venus a glance, he returned to Earth.</p>
<p>He naturally didn’t kill Ya. Not only did he not kill him, but he even used the power of Human Sovereign to treat Ya’s injuries.</p>
<p>The Son of Heaven’s Sword couldn’t be unsheathed, nor did it have the ability to kill. It was similar to holding an iron rod, but it was surprisingly compatible with the power of Human Sovereign.</p>
<p>The power of Human Sovereign could typically be used by Zhou Wen’s fist. It was very difficult to transmit it through weapons. The Son of Heaven’s Sword was currently the only weapon that could work well with the power of Human Sovereign.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, the Son of Heaven’s Sword could transmit the power of Human Sovereign, but it was still impossible to unsheath it.</p>
<p>The strike that Zhou Wen had stabbed through Zhong Ziya’s chest looked like it had killed him, but in fact, it had treated his injuries. However, outsiders couldn’t tell. Even if they later learned that Zhong Ziya was still alive, they would only write it off as Zhong Ziya’s life-saving mystic technique and wouldn’t suspect Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>After this battle, the name of Deceit King spread across Earth. The battle between him and Immortal was analyzed frame by frame by the various factions. It was a bizarre battle that could be described as textbook material.</p>
<p>After all sorts of slow playback analysis, people realized that so many things had happened in the blink of an eye. Immortal and Deceit King had pulled off all sorts of schemes and psychological games, but in the end, it was still Deceit King who had the last laugh.</p>
<p>However, even the reaction of Immortal’s defeat could be considered textbook material.. Many colleges later used the analysis videos of this battle to educate students on the difference between using brute force and using techniques to fight.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1294'>Chapter 1294: Chick Returns</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen teleported to Earth before returning to the garden through the swapping of a brick in the garden with Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping.</p>
<p>He didn’t directly do the swap because he was afraid that others would notice something from the brick.</p>
<p>After returning, Zhou Wen continued researching Absolute Space.</p>
<p>After watching Zhong Ziya and company clear the level, Zhou Wen felt that it was pointless to barely clear the Venusian dimensional zone. It was useless to obtain one or two stars. He had to obtain first place, which was above five stars, to obtain the true Venusian Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi, The Fallen, and the Holy Spirit Association used three different methods to arrive in front of the Golden Palace. From the looks of it, Tsukuyomi was the fastest, and The Fallen was also faster than the Holy Spirit Association. Based on this, the less time it takes to reach the Golden Palace, the higher the chance of obtaining a starred rating. However, the time difference between The Fallen and the Holy Spirit Association wasn’t that great. The Fallen received four stars, while the Holy Spirit Association only received one star. This means that other than taking less time, there should be other criteria… Zhou Wen analyzed the various possibilities to make it easier for him to clear the level in the future.</p>
<p>The various factions were also analyzing this problem, but they had one more thing to analyze than Zhou Wen—the battle between Deceit King and Immortal.</p>
<p>As Ya was already severely injured to begin with, everyone knew that the battle didn’t showcase Ya’s true strength. It was useless to analyze it, so they were just analyzing the battle between Zhou Wen and Immortal.</p>
<p>“No matter how many times I watch it, I still feel that these two people are too strong. Just a mistake that isn’t considered a mistake ended the battle.” Xia Xuanyue repeatedly watched the battle replay and couldn’t help but praise.</p>
<p>“People who are good at spatial abilities are thorny characters,” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>“It’s not just a matter of spatial abilities. Such a fellow will be very terrifying no matter which faction he belongs to,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“That’s true, but Deceit King is really shameless. He took advantage of both sides and obtained benefits from both sides. He wanted people from both sides dead. He’s really ruthless,” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>“Brother, who do you think this Deceit King is?” Xia Xuanyue said after some thought. She had a vague feeling that she found Deceit King familiar.</p>
<p>However, it was only an inkling. Xia Xuanyue didn’t know why she had such a feeling.</p>
<p>“Who knows? There are too many powerful people in this world. We have to be careful. If we aren’t careful, our Xia family might fall and never be able to make a comeback.” Xia Liuchuan sighed.</p>
<p>Although the six families had their heritage and were still top-notch forces on Earth, they no longer had the absolute advantage like before.</p>
<p>“Do you think it’s possible that Human Sovereign and Deceit King are the same person?” Xia Xuanyue said after some thought. She wasn’t sure, but she felt they were vaguely similar.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. If Deceit King has the domineering strength of the Human Sovereign, he could have directly destroyed Immortal. Why would he go through so much trouble?” Xia Liuchuan felt that the possibility wasn’t high.</p>
<p>The various factions had similar guesses, but after some analysis, they felt that the possibility of Deceit King and Human Sovereign being the same person wasn’t high.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was at home fiddling with the Flaming Monarch Companion Egg and the Void Bird skill crystal.</p>
<p>Flaming Monarch: Terror</p>
<p>Life Providence: Sovereign of Fire</p>
<p>Life Soul: Power of Fire</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Flaming Nation</p>
<p>Terror transformation: Eternal Flame</p>
<p>Strength: 86</p>
<p>Speed: 93</p>
<p>Constitution: 91</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 99</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Fire Cage, River of Flames, Burning Body, Road of Ashes</p>
<p>Companion Form: Flaming Monarch King Sword</p>
<p>This was a very pure fire-elemental Companion Beast. Its offensive strength was off the charts and it was highly lethal, but its flaws were relatively obvious. If a pure fire-elemental Companion Beast were to encounter one that countered it, it would be very easy to restrain it.</p>
<p>However, in some special environments, Companion Beasts like Flaming Monarch were invincible.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to hatch the Flaming Monarch, he suddenly heard a bird’s cry. A golden stream of light appeared out of thin air and flashed in front of him. The Flaming Monarch Companion Egg in Zhou Wen’s hand vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly prepared for combat. However, on careful look, he realized that a golden chick had landed on a tree branch in the garden. It had the Flaming Monarch Companion Egg in its mouth.</p>
<p>It swung its head and threw the Flaming Monarch Companion Egg into the air. Then, it raised its head and opened its mouth, swallowing the Companion Egg that was two to three times bigger than its head.</p>
<p>“Chick?” Zhou Wen sized up the chick in surprise. Its aura resembled Chick’s, but he wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>This chick was only the size of a parrot. It was covered in pale golden fur and was much smaller than before. Furthermore, it didn’t look as ferocious as before. Now, it didn’t look like an eagle, but a parrot.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Chick was inside the Chaos Bead. Without Zhou Wen’s strength to open it, it was impossible for Chick to come out even if it had evolved to the Terror grade.</p>
<p>The chick burped after swallowing the Flaming Monarch Companion Egg. When it heard Zhou Wen’s voice, it spread its wings. Before Zhou Wen could clearly discern its actions, it had already landed on Zhou Wen’s shoulder and rubbed its tiny head intimately against his neck.</p>
<p>It’s really Chick! Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. Just come out if you want to, but why eat my Flaming Monarch Companion Egg? It wasn’t easy to obtain it.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen knew that Chick was much more useful than the Flaming Monarch, so he didn’t mind. He held Chick in his hand and carefully looked at it. He realized that feathers had grown on its head. The tail feathers behind it had also grown longer. It looked a little like a parrot.</p>
<p>This fellow seems to be slowly growing towards the appearance of a phoenix. Could it be that it has to advance to the Calamity grade before it can return to the appearance of a phoenix? Zhou Wen was secretly alarmed.</p>
<p>Chick bounced around and flew back to Ya’er’s hand to play with her.</p>
<p>Having lost his Companion Egg, Zhou Wen had no choice but to take out the skill crystal of the Void Bird.</p>
<p>What kind of spatial skill will it be? Zhou Wen was somewhat expectant. After all, it was a spatial skill crystal. Furthermore, it was at the Terror grade. It was too rare.</p>
<p>He snapped a picture with his phone and saw that it was indeed a Void Bird crystal.</p>
<p>At the same time, he circulated the Godfiend Era and Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art in an attempt to absorb the skill crystal. He easily absorbed it into his body, opening up a new Essence Energy circulation path.</p>
<p>When the skill crystal was completely absorbed, Zhou Wen’s expression turned odd.</p>
<p>Wings of Tomorrow: Wings that fly towards tomorrow.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Is this a spatial skill? It looks like a temporal skill no matter how I look at it! Zhou Wen found it unbelievable that this thing could really fly to tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1295'>Chapter 1295: Lady Luck’s Necklace</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully studied the skill, Wings of Tomorrow, but he couldn’t figure out what kind of skill it was.</p>
<p>Its literal meaning made it appear to be a skill that allowed one to travel into the future. Perhaps one could see tomorrow’s scenes, or one could really head straight for tomorrow.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen knew very well that traveling into the future wasn’t something a Calamity-grade could do, much less a Terror-grade. Zhou Wen didn’t believe that a Terror-grade Void Bird could travel into the future.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when he absorbed the skill, the information transmitted from the skill crystal seemed to indicate that it was a teleportation ability. It left Zhou Wen somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>Won’t I know once I give it a try? Zhou Wen originally wanted to give it a try, but on second thought, he decided to wait for An Sheng and company to return.</p>
<p>If this skill really allowed him to travel into the future—tomorrow—it remained a question whether he could return and if he could, to which time period.</p>
<p>Suppressing his curiosity, Zhou Wen continued studying Absolute Space.</p>
<p>The problem regarding the movement of the two Absolute Spaces had yet to be resolved. The swapping method via Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping failed to form an effective cycle.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s prior battle with Immortal gave him a new idea.</p>
<p>Immortal had used an exchange spell before. It was very similar to Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping, but the target of the exchange was the enemy.</p>
<p>If I can exchange the bullet’s location with one of the Absolute Spaces, will that work? Zhou Wen tried a few times and realized that it was impossible.</p>
<p>The Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping technique needed a mark first. It was impossible to mark the bullet traveling at the speed of light. At the very least, Zhou Wen definitely couldn’t do it to date.</p>
<p>Since this didn’t work, Zhou Wen had to think of another solution.</p>
<p>Just as he was in the midst of research, his phone rang. Zhou Wen picked it up and realized that it was from Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“Junior, there’s a big deal.” Liu Yun said in his message.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered to reply to him. He didn’t believe that this fellow would have anything good to offer.</p>
<p>“Someone wants to clear the Venusian dimensional zone and plans on seeking my help and Deceit King’s help. Are you interested?” Liu Yun sent another message.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued studying his skills without replying.</p>
<p>“It’s definitely some absolute nouveau riche. As long as Deceit King is willing to take action and can guarantee that his family can enter the rankings, even if it’s just one star, any price is negotiable.” Liu Yun didn’t give up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself that he was already considered a nouveau riche. Even the six families didn’t have as many Terror-grade Companion Beasts as him. No matter how wealthy the family Liu Yun mentioned was, what could they offer that would tempt him?</p>
<p>Getting no response from Zhou Wen, Liu Yun sent another message: “Although the other party isn’t an existence like the six families, he’s still at the level of a local emperor. His status is similar to your family’s An Tianzuo, and he’s even richer. The price he can offer will definitely satisfy you.”</p>
<p>“Have you heard of the Lady Luck Companion Beast? It’s from his place. It’s the only one on Earth. If you can help them get on the rankings, they are willing to use Lady Luck for payment.”</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s last message garnered Zhou Wen’s attention and tempted him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had naturally heard of the Lady Luck Companion Beast. Luck-type Companion Beasts were rare to begin with, and Lady Luck was one of the best. She was considered famous, so it was difficult for Zhou Wen not to know.</p>
<p>However, the so-called Lady Luck Companion Beast wasn’t a goddess, but a lucky pixie with transparent wings on its back and a petite body the size of a finger.</p>
<p>The lucky pixie’s companion form was a necklace. The necklace was beautiful, and the pendant was a gorgeous pixie ornament. It looked like an ornament of a goddess, so it was also known as Lady Luck Necklace.</p>
<p>It was said that after wearing the necklace, one could easily find Companion Eggs and crystals if they went out to hunt dimensional creatures. Although it was unknown how much Luck had been added, it was still one of the best Companion Beasts known to add Luck.</p>
<p>There was one thing in the East District which could match the effects of the Lady Luck Necklace. It was said to be called Lucky Star. It was owned by the Zhang family, but no one had really seen what it looked like. It was only rumored that the Zhang family owned such a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“Is the other party really willing to use the Lady Luck Necklace as payment?” Zhou Wen replied.</p>
<p>“It’s 100% real. I’ve seen the Lady Luck Necklace with my own eyes. It’s worn around that big shot’s neck. He said that as long as you can help them get on the rankings, he will think of a way to transfer the Lady Luck Necklace to you,” Liu Yun immediately replied.</p>
<p>If it’s really the Lady Luck Necklace, that’s very generous. If I obtain that necklace, my Luck points will increase significantly. Perhaps I can obtain a large number of Terror-grade Companion Eggs during my random grinding. Although Zhou Wen really wanted to obtain the Lady Luck Necklace, unfortunately, he didn’t have the ability to clear the Venusian instance dungeon. He didn’t have the ability to obtain it even if he wanted it.</p>
<p>“I don’t have the means. Get him to find someone else,” Zhou Wen replied.</p>
<p>“If they could find others, they wouldn’t have come looking for us. They really had no choice, so they took the risk to seek our help,” Liu Yun replied.</p>
<p>“What do you mean there’s really no other way? Will they die if they don’t go to the Venusian dimensional zone?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>“Not really, but that tycoon made a bet with someone else. He has to be on the rankings in three months. Otherwise, he will kowtow and admit his mistake. Now, that tycoon is almost going crazy. He’s looking for help everywhere.” Liu Yun explained the situation in detail.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had imagined that someone who had the Lady Luck Necklace was from the West District because the necklace was originally produced there.</p>
<p>However, after hearing Liu Yun’s description, he realized that the person with the Lady Luck Necklace was actually from the East District.</p>
<p>The person’s name was Song Guojia. As the name Song Guojia wasn’t a nice-sounding name, he gave himself the nickname of Lord Fourth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had heard of this name before. In a certain area in the East District, the name of Lord Fourth was as terrifying as Luoyang’s An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>Unlike An Tianzuo, Lord Fourth had a good relationship with the six families. Furthermore, he was very popular with people, unlike the An family.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that if he was as rich and generous as Lord Fourth, he would also have friends all over the world.</p>
<p>According to what Zhou Wen knew, there were especially many Companion Beasts like Ginseng Babies produced in the dimensional zones of Lord Fourth. Every one of them cost an astronomical amount. There were also quite a number of similar Companion Beasts that had healing abilities.</p>
<p>Such a healing Companion Beast was in high demand. Even if one couldn’t buy a top-notch one, just getting a random one would do.</p>
<p>Rumors had it that Lord Fourth had a Terror-grade Ginseng Baby. Even a dead person could pull back their soul from Lord Yama if they drank a mouthful of the Ginseng Baby’s blood.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1296'>Chapter 1296: Another Way to Get on the Rankings</h3>
<p>The reward was good, but one had to have the ability to get it. Although people called Zhou Wen Deceit King, Zhou Wen wasn’t someone without a bottom line. He definitely wouldn’t do something he wasn’t confident of.</p>
<p>After rejecting Liu Yun’s invitation, Zhou Wen decided to do further studies. Regardless of how many stars he could obtain in the end, he would first clear the Venusian instance dungeon.</p>
<p>To be honest, Zhou Wen really coveted the Lady Luck Necklace. There were too few Companion Beasts that added Luck.</p>
<p>If one was lucky, not only would there be a higher chance of a Companion Eggs dropping while grinding dungeons, but the effect of flawless evasion would also become stronger.</p>
<p>Is there a better way to clear the level if I don’t want to fight the Calamity-grade bullet head on? Zhou Wen frowned in thought.</p>
<p>In fact, there was a method, but Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if it was useful in reality.</p>
<p>Previously, Zhou Wen had always wanted to kill the Calamity entity that shot the bullet, so he had studied the method to resist the seventh bullet. However, if he only wanted to reach the Golden Palace, it wouldn’t be that troublesome.</p>
<p>Grim Reaper No. 10 could withstand the first six shots. The seventh shot could be avoided using a Terror-grade Companion Beast as a scapegoat. Following that would be six more shots.</p>
<p>Such a long period gave him sufficient time to run to the Golden Palace.</p>
<p>Of course, the premise was that Calamity-grade bullets were the same as in-game—it prioritized the creatures with the highest levels first.</p>
<p>If I do it that way, I still have to sacrifice a Terror-grade Companion Beast to reach the Golden Palace. After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that this was the only solution for now. Furthermore, he still needed to give it a try.</p>
<p>In-game, there was no such thing as a reward from reaching the Golden Palace. The Golden Palace’s door didn’t open either. It seemed like he had to kill the Calamity-grade creature.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen felt that clearing the level in real life wasn’t a problem. After watching the Holy Spirit Association clear the level, he was basically certain that Calamity-grade bullets would target the strongest creature. However, he couldn’t rule out any special circumstances.</p>
<p>Liu Yun sent a few more messages, constantly attempting to persuade Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I can take this job, but there are two conditions.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and replied.</p>
<p>“Tell me.” Liu Yun was delighted. Although Lord Fourth was mainly inviting Deceit King, if he helped close the deal, he as Thief Sage could obtain valuable benefits.</p>
<p>“I want the Lady Luck Necklace. In addition, prepare a Terror-grade Companion Beast for me. I’ll take payment before doing anything. Furthermore, I’m only in charge of issuing orders. If anyone doesn’t follow instructions, I won’t be responsible for the results, nor can I guarantee absolute safety.” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“This… Typically, people get a 50% down payment first and receive the rest after the matter is done.” Liu Yun said.</p>
<p>“These are my rules. If you want to work with me, you have to follow my rules. Otherwise, let him find someone else.” Although Zhou Wen really wanted the Lady Luck Necklace, he wouldn’t give in.</p>
<p>Furthermore, such matters couldn’t be accommodated. Since he was leading people in, he hoped to bring them out alive.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll talk to Lord Fourth and see what he has to say.” After Liu Yun sent the message, there was no response from him for a long time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush. After all, he had to make some preparations. Safety first. If Lord Fourth really wanted to go, he had to prepare a few Substitute Talismans. Life-preservation was of utmost priority.</p>
<p>How do I reach the six paths behind Netherworld City? I’ll try to see if I can grind some Heavenly Robe. Wearing Heavenly Robe inside my armor might save me at critical moments. Zhou Wen had always wanted to go to Netherworld City, but he was at a loss regarding the last thousand-year dream.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was just about to take out a piece of paper and a pen to see if he could draw some Substitute Talismans when he heard his phone chime again.</p>
<p>“Lord Fourth has agreed to your conditions. He hopes to meet you and have a detailed chat. The time and place will be decided by you. Lord Fourth will come alone.” Liu Yun sent an update over.</p>
<p>“That fast?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>Liu Yun understood Zhou Wen’s concerns and sent a message. “With my understanding of Lord Fourth, this shouldn’t be a problem. However, one can’t let down their guard. It’s best if you choose a place that can guarantee your safety.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and sent a message. “I don’t have time now. I’ll contact you when I do.”</p>
<p>He had promised An Sheng to take care of the family. He couldn’t leave randomly before An Sheng and company returned. It wouldn’t be too late to go after they returned.</p>
<p>“Then when will you be free? Lord Fourth is very anxious,” Liu Yun said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t reply. Liu Yun was somewhat depressed, but it wasn’t appropriate for him to tell Lord Fourth straight to the face. All he could do was send a message to Lord Fourth, saying that Deceit King had something important to do first. He would contact him after he was done.</p>
<p>Lord Fourth was very straightforward. He said that he would wait for Deceit King’s schedule to clear up. He had already prepared the Lady Luck Necklace and a Terror-grade Companion Beast. Deceit King could have them whenever he wanted.</p>
<p>Liu Yun sent a message to Zhou Wen, conveying Lord Fourth’s intentions, but he didn’t receive a reply.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen grinded dungeons daily and studied the use of Absolute Space, waiting for An Sheng to return.</p>
<p>Before An Sheng returned, someone challenged the Venusian dimensional zone. This time, it was the League of Guardians. However, Immortal wasn’t among the people who came.</p>
<p>Cave Era, Uesugi Nao, and Jiuyue appeared in the Venusian dimensional zone. There were only three of them.</p>
<p>Everyone was puzzled as to why Immortal hadn’t come. He was the core of the League of Guardians. It seemed a little too rash for him to be missing for a huge matter like attempting the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>However, the performance of the trio made people realise that there was more than one path in the world. There was also more than one way to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>After Cave Era and Jiuyue augmented Uesugi Nao with the power of time and space, Uesugi Nao’s Great Skyfiend Guardian unleashed unparalleled speed.</p>
<p>After the sixth Golden Battle God was killed, Uesugi Nao—or perhaps Great Skyfiend—rushed into the pathway like a phantom.</p>
<p>When the Calamity-grade gunshot sounded, Great Skyfiend wasn’t hit. She seemed to have dodged it. As she was so fast, few people saw how she had dodged.</p>
<p>Following that, it was time for Uesugi Nao to perform. She was really like a divine devil. Her body was like a phantom as she dodged the bullets again and again. She rushed to the Golden Palace before the seventh bullet shot out and obtained the golden ball from the Golden Palace. At the same time, she entered the rankings.</p>
<p>Everything happened too quickly. Before anyone could react, Great Skyfiend’s name had already appeared on the rankings. There were two stars behind her name.</p>
<p>“How did she do it?” Everyone widened their eyes in disbelief as they looked at the name that was third on the rankings.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1297'>Chapter 1297: Another Invitation</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“This is what a foundation begets. The Holy Spirit Association paid such a huge price to enter the rankings, but the League of Guardians didn’t even deploy their most powerful Immortal to enter the rankings. Furthermore, they obtained two stars and rank above the Holy Spirit Association.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, the League of Guardians is still too powerful.”</p>
<p>“You can’t say that. With so many preceding examples, the League of Guardians can come up with a corresponding strategy. It doesn’t mean that their strength is definitely stronger than the Holy Spirit Association’s. It’s just that the people and skills they use are just right.”</p>
<p>“That’s true, but they are ultimately too strong.”</p>
<p>“They reached the Golden Palace at such a fast speed, but they only obtained two stars. It looks like the speed of reaching the Golden Palace doesn’t seem to be the standard for obtaining stars?”</p>
<p>Everyone was somewhat surprised by the blitz strategy the League of Guardians used to enter the rankings.</p>
<p>Regardless of the reason—be it strategy or strength—they could only be said to be very strong for being capable of this feat.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also looked at their method of clearing the level. This method wasn’t worth referencing because it required the cooperation of three abilities.</p>
<p>Each aspect of the trifecta of time, space, and Great Skyfiend’s speed was indispensable.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had Great Skyfiend’s speed and wasn’t slower than her. He also had spatial abilities, but he didn’t have temporal abilities. Unless he could find a temporal expert like Cave Era to augment his temporal abilities, he would not be able to reach the Golden Palace before the seventh shot.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already tried many times in-game. It was difficult to reach the Golden Palace by relying solely on speed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was no reward for reaching the Golden Palace in-game, nor could he open the door. Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in such a method. He still had to think of a way to crack the seventh bullet and kill the hidden Calamity-grade creature.</p>
<p>After the League of Guardians, no other creatures entered the rankings.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi, The Fallen, Great Skyfiend, and Ya. There were only four creatures on the rankings.</p>
<p>I wonder how many stars the Cube will give if I kill that Calamity creature? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>A message notification sounded. Zhou Wen imagined that it was Liu Yun, but to his surprise, it was from Hui Haifeng.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, is there a way to reach the Golden Palace?” Hui Haifeng’s message was very direct.</p>
<p>“Yes.” After watching Great Skyfiend and company’s battle, Zhou Wen was even more certain that the Venusian dimensional zone in reality was the same as in-game. The Calamity-grade bullets only targeted the creature whose order in life was highest.</p>
<p>“Do me a favor and lead a team to enter the rankings,” Hui Haifeng said.</p>
<p>“What for?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement. He didn’t know why people liked to be on the rankings so much. What was the point in getting onto the rankings when they couldn’t get first place?</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng explained, “People in the Federation now have a weaker sense of belonging to the Federation. If we don’t do anything, who will be proud of being a member of the Federation in the future? Perhaps in a few years, people will only know about the League of Guardians and the Holy Spirit Association. There will be no Federation in their hearts.”</p>
<p>“Is there a problem?” Zhou Wen didn’t have a sense of belonging to the Federation, so he didn’t think there was a problem.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng sighed and said, “Humans are creatures that like to fight. They want to vie for everything. With the Federation as a system, they can still coordinate in various aspects. If this fig leaf is gone one day and all sides fall out to vie for the right to rule, who do you think will suffer the most?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen understood what Hui Haifeng meant. Once that happened, countless people would die from the various factions vying for supremacy. The ones suffering the most were still ordinary people.</p>
<p>“I can only think of a way to get on the rankings, but I can’t guarantee that the results will be good.” Zhou Wen didn’t wish for such a situation to happen.</p>
<p>“As long as you can get on the rankings, there’s no need to worry about anything else,” Hui Haifeng said. “When can you go? Any preparations needed?”</p>
<p>“Let me think about it again. There are some things I haven’t figured out yet. I need to be fully prepared,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“Alright. Give me a list of anything you need.” Hui Haifeng didn’t lack money. He controlled the Mythical Serum business, and the Hui family was now one of the richest families.</p>
<p>In terms of money, the Hui family might have more money than the six families, but its heritage and accumulated resources were lacking. Some things couldn’t be bought even with the Mythical Serum.</p>
<p>“Do you have any Luck Companion Beasts?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Luck Companion Beasts are relatively rare. We can find them, but the highest is at the Mythical stage. I’m afraid we won’t be able to find any higher,” Hui Haifeng said.</p>
<p>“Any level is fine.” Zhou Wen still wanted to see if he could gather a set of lucky equipment.</p>
<p>“Alright, wait for my news.” Hui Haifeng hung up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that this matter wasn’t easy. The requirements of Lord Fourth weren’t high—he just needed to get on the rankings. That wasn’t difficult.</p>
<p>However, if he wanted to help Hui Haifeng get on the rankings, it wouldn’t be that simple. If he was ranked below the League of Guardians and the Holy Spirit Association, there wasn’t much point in getting on the rankings.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng didn’t send any messages for the next two to three days. It was probably because it was really difficult to find Luck Companion Beasts. Even if others had one, they would hatch it themselves and seldom sell it.</p>
<p>The only good news was that An Sheng and An Tianzuo had finally returned. Zhou Wen couldn’t stay in Overseer Manor forever.</p>
<p>“Has it been settled?” Zhou Wen noticed that An Sheng didn’t seem happy.</p>
<p>“In a way. We did find an Essence Crystal mine there, but the stores are much lower than expected. I reckon there are only tens of thousands of cubes,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“That’s too little?” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but ask when he heard that there were tens of thousands of cubes.</p>
<p>“To ordinary people, it’s indeed a lot. However, to the accelerator, the materials refined from tens of thousands of crystals are only enough for half a shot.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed when he heard that. In the past, he only knew that the accelerator must have expended a lot of energy. Otherwise, it would be impossible for it to be that powerful. However, he never expected it to be so expensive. Tens of thousands of Essence Crystals could only be used for half a shot. If they were to fire two or three shots, the An family would definitely go bankrupt.</p>
<p>“However, it’s better than nothing. Let’s take it slow. The accelerator is only a form of deterrence after all. I don’t think there will be many opportunities to use it in the future.” An Sheng still had something to do. After chatting with Zhou Wen for a while, he went off.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t need to stay in the Overseer Manor any longer. He contacted Liu Yun and got him to arrange for a meeting with Lord Fourth.</p>
<p>It was naturally impossible for him to choose an area near Luoyang for his meeting with Lord Fourth. Thankfully, Zhou Wen’s instant transmission was superb, so it wasn’t difficult for him to switch to a distant place.</p>
<p>Finally, Zhou Wen chose the West District’s Dossier Island to meet Lord Fourth. The island was very close to the mainland and was one of the few islands controlled by the Federation.</p>
<p>It had a dimensional zone that produced Lucky Birds. Zhou Wen planned on taking the opportunity to have a look.</p>
<p>Lord Fourth agreed readily. Zhou Wen decided the time and place.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t tell him the location ahead of time. He only told him when and where to go before telling him the exact location when they met.</p>
<p>Thankfully, nothing happened. When Zhou Wen saw Lord Fourth, he couldn’t help but be surprised.</p>
<p>He was somewhat different from what Zhou Wen had imagined. The name ‘Lord Fourth’ sounded like an elder, but the person Zhou Wen saw was a middle-aged man. He looked refined, making it impossible to associate him with the word “lord.”</p>
<p>“We meet again,” Lord Fourth said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Jing Daoxian?” Zhou Wen was alarmed when he heard his voice.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1298'>Chapter 1298: You Apparently Call Him Teacher</h3>
<p>“Not bad. You can still tell from my voice,” said Lord Fourth with a smile.</p>
<p>“I never expected the famous Lord Fourth, who has a wide circle of friends, to be the devil of the Federation, Jing Daoxian.” Zhou Wen stared at him warily as he sized him up. He increasingly felt that this person was Jing Daoxian. He had a special aura that others couldn’t imitate.</p>
<p>“Others didn’t expect that the famous Deceit King, who suppressed the Holy Spirit Association and the League of Guardians and is currently wanted by both officials and renegades, as well as being the number one person on the bounty list is actually you, Zhou Wen,” Lord Fourth mimicked Zhou Wen’s tone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that Jing Daoxian had long seen through his identity. It was useless even if he changed his voice in the Dragon King armor. He did not know how he had recognized him.</p>
<p>“How did you know it was me?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“You did a very good job changing your temperament, physique, voice, and even your personality. Others didn’t recognize you, but I’m different. The only people who have obtained the Lost Immortal Sutra and haven’t gone mad or died are the two of us. Back then, I used some means to transfer the Lost Immortal Sutra to you. Although I didn’t master it, I still know a little about it. That’s how I was able to determine clues from you.” Lord Fourth paused before saying, “You should just call me Lord Fourth. The appearance of Jing Daoxian isn’t suitable yet.”</p>
<p>“You will feel fear too?” Zhou Wen was somewhat curious. He didn’t know who a devil like Jing Daoxian would be afraid of.</p>
<p>“It’s not that I’m afraid. It’s just unsuitable.” Lord Fourth explained very patiently, “Back when I saw you, I was seriously injured and nearly died. That was why the bureau caught up to me. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have seen me. Speaking of that injury, a large part of the reason was because of the Lost Immortal Sutra.</p>
<p>“In my life, I am bent on completing anything I set my mind to. However, there are two things I haven’t done. One is that I lost to that hypocrite. The second is that I failed to master the Lost Immortal Sutra.”</p>
<p>“Hypocrite?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>“It’s the Zhang family’s Hero King as you people call him,” said Lord Fourth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood that Jing Daoxian’s loss to the Hero King was probably referring to the matter of the number one beauty of the Federation.</p>
<p>Lord Fourth continued, “Back then, all those who came into contact with the Lost Immortal Sutra went crazy. However, I refused to have my beliefs shaken. Others can’t master it, but I insist on mastering it. What others can’t do is fun for me. I originally thought that it was only an Essence Energy Art. Even if it’s meant to be cultivated by an Immortal Emperor or Buddha, I would still be able to find a way to make it serve me.”</p>
<p>“I never expected to fail at taming it. I almost died in the Holy Land because of it,” Lord Fourth said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“You entered the Holy Land back then? How did you enter? Isn’t it said that only low-level humans can enter the Holy Land?” Zhou Wen had always wanted to enter the Holy Land to take a look because the former principal was likely inside a particular Holy Temple there, but he hadn’t found a way to enter.</p>
<p>“I naturally have my means if I wish to enter.” Lord Fourth smiled and said, “However, it’s best you don’t go. Even if you have the power to suppress the League of Guardians and the Holy Spirit Association, you still won’t be able to leave alive.”</p>
<p>“What’s inside? What’s going on with the six Holy Temples?” Zhou Wen had never figured out the relationship between the six Holy Temples and the dimension. All he knew was that it seemed to be the dimension’s contact point on Earth, similar to a temple or church in the human world.</p>
<p>“Do you know the phrase ‘concession settlement?’” Lord Fourth asked a question instead of answering.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of it. It’s a rather ancient saying. It seems to be an office rented by a country in another country.” Zhou Wen thought for a while before recalling what the phrase was about. When he had studied history in the past, there had only been a few mentions of it in textbooks.</p>
<p>“The Holy Land is equivalent to a concession settlement of the dimension on Earth. Nothing there is restricted by the rules of Earth. The dimensional creatures can descend freely. Even Calamity-grade or Apocalypse-grade creatures can appear there and unleash their full might. You’ve been there before. Thankfully, you weren’t qualified to let them take a second gander at you back then. That’s why you were able to return alive. If you were to go again now, I’m afraid you wouldn’t be so lucky anymore,” said Lord Fourth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately alarmed. If that was the case, he was considered lucky to return alive.</p>
<p>“If you can return alive, why can’t I?” Zhou Wen wasn’t convinced. He wanted to know more from Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>Lord Fourth looked at Zhou Wen with a teasing look and said, “I came back alive because I could steel my heart. I’m afraid you wouldn’t be able to be ruthless when the time comes.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen looked at him in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“You’ll know if you go there in the future.” Lord Fourth was clearly unwilling to talk about the Holy Land. He must have done something unspeakable there.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a while but failed to figure out what he was talking about.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you came to talk to me about this? What do you want?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I get Liu Yun to tell you a long time ago? I want you to help me leave my name on the rankings,” said Lord Fourth.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you do it yourself?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Lord Fourth doesn’t have the ability to enter the rankings,” said Lord Fourth.</p>
<p>His words were a little awkward, but Zhou Wen still understood what he meant. What he meant was that with the status of Lord Fourth, he shouldn’t have the ability to enter the rankings. Others would definitely suspect him if he really did it.</p>
<p>“Did you really make a bet with someone?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Lord Fourth nodded.</p>
<p>“What did you bet on?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“Someone on my side has to be on the rankings within three months. Otherwise, I’ll have to kowtow and admit my mistake,” Lord Fourth said casually.</p>
<p>“Who did you make the bet with?” Zhou Wen had heard from Liu Yun that Lord Fourth had made a bet with someone, but he had no idea who he had made the bet with.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t curious about this matter previously, but he was somewhat curious now that he knew that Lord Fourth was Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian was definitely not someone who would do something for no reason. He had definitely made a bet with someone, so if he knew who he was betting with, Zhou Wen might figure out what he was up to.</p>
<p>“Regarding the person who made the bet with me, you apparently call him teacher,” Lord Fourth said with a faint smile.</p>
<p>“Who did you say?” Zhou Wen widened his eyes as he looked at Lord Fourth. His eyes were about to pop out as his face filled with disbelief.</p>
<p>He naturally knew who Jing Daoxian was talking about, but he couldn’t believe it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1299'>Chapter 1299: Suspicious of Everything</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“His reputation on Earth isn’t any better than mine. There’s no need to mention his name.” As Lord Fourth spoke, he took out two boxes and placed them in front of Zhou Wen. He continued, “These two boxes contain the Luck Pixie and a Terror-grade Black Bear Spirit. Feel free to take them.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at him and said, “And you are certain I’ll help you?”</p>
<p>Lord Fourth laughed. “Why won’t you? Because the person I’m betting with is your teacher? Are you still not disavowing a sinner like him?”</p>
<p>“Whether I disavow him or not has nothing to do with helping you,” said Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Then even more you should help me. Aren’t these what you want?” Lord Fourth pointed at the two boxes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Lord Fourth with an odd expression, unclear what he was up to.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally didn’t wish for Wang Mingyuan to lose. A shrewd and experienced fellow like Jing Daoxian knew as well, but he had deliberately told Zhou Wen ahead of time who his counterpart was.</p>
<p>Could it be that his goal isn’t for me to clear the level? Or could it be that his bet with Teacher isn’t as simple as clearing the level? Zhou Wen racked his brains, but failed to come up with an answer.</p>
<p>“It isn’t as complicated as you imagine. It’s just a bet. Even if you choose not to do it, there will be others to take your place. It’s just getting on the rankings, nothing difficult,” said Lord Fourth.</p>
<p>“What will happen if you win?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“If I win, he’ll need to give me something to aid in extending my lifespan,” Lord Fourth said.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen recall that Jing Daoxian had a problem with his lifespan. Previously, he had wanted Banana Fairy to help him refine some medicine, but he hadn’t done so for the past few years. He probably hadn’t found the ingredients required.</p>
<p>“So are you game or not?” Lord Fourth asked again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still hesitant. Just as Jing Daoxian said, getting on the rankings wasn’t that difficult. Even if he didn’t do it, it wasn’t difficult for Jing Daoxian to find others to help him—given his strength.</p>
<p>However, even if others helped Jing Daoxian get onto the rankings, that person ought not to be Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept thinking about it. What if I take Jing Daoxian’s items, but do not help him get onto the rankings. What if I keep stalling for time?</p>
<p>As though reading Zhou Wen’s mind, Lord Fourth said with an insincere smile, “You can take the items if you want them; likewise, you can choose not to do the job.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. “What do you mean by that?”</p>
<p>“After I give you the items, they are yours. You can keep them or throw them away. The bet’s deadline is still two months and eight days away. I’ll be at Lunar Deer Alley and I’ll wait for you for two months and eight days. You can choose to come or not.” Lord Fourth turned around to leave after saying those words.</p>
<p>“What’s the meaning of this?” Zhou Wen looked at Lord Fourth’s back, perplexed as to what he was up to.</p>
<p>Lord Fourth ignored him. He returned to his ship and got the captain to steer the ship away from Dossier Island.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the two boxes in front of him with great suspicion. Could Jing Daoxian have placed a bomb inside, thus the reason why he was so anxious to leave?</p>
<p>However, boxes like this were no different from being transparent to Zhou Wen. Just by carefully listening, he could tell that a necklace and Companion Egg was placed inside. There were no bombs.</p>
<p>The necklace was likely the Lady Luck Necklace. There was a seal on it, as though a particular method had been used to forcefully extract it from the original owner.</p>
<p>Under the necklace was a card. On it were the instructions for recontracting.</p>
<p>The Companion Egg inside the other box was a black furry ball. Jing Daoxian said that it was a Black Bear Spirit. Zhou Wen didn’t know what kind of Companion Beast it was, but from the aura it emitted, he knew that it wasn’t something of inferior quality.</p>
<p>Could it be that Jing Daoxian is lying? Their bet isn’t about getting on the rankings but has something to do with me? If I choose not to go, will Teacher lose? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but become suspicious. This matter was just too bizarre.</p>
<p>What kind of person was Jing Daoxian? The number one devil in the Federation. Was he someone who would be willing to lose? He could easily produce two precious items to give to Zhou Wen. Furthermore, he had said that he left the completion of the job up to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>But viewing it from a different angle, this could be a trap laid by Jing Daoxian. He deliberately made him read too much into it, hoping to exploit such thoughts of his.</p>
<p>If only I could get to meet Teacher. At least I can figure out whether he had made a bet with Jing Daoxian. Zhou Wen became overly suspicious of everything because of Jing Daoxian. He even suspected whether the person who Jing Daoxian had made a bet with was Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian might have said that on purpose to make Zhou Wen conflicted so as to achieve his goal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a while but failed to come up with a reason. He decided to put away the Lady Luck Necklace and Companion Egg.</p>
<p>They are definitely good things. There won’t be any problems taking them. I’ll consider the rest later. After Zhou Wen put away the items, he turned around and went to the dimensional zone on Asiri Island.</p>
<p>After circling the island and killing many avian dimensional creatures, he didn’t see any Lucky Birds or the tiny palm symbol. All Zhou Wen could do was return resentfully.</p>
<p>On the way back, Zhou Wen kept thinking about Jing Daoxian. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that something was amiss. It didn’t make sense for Jing Daoxian to give him such a huge benefit for no reason.</p>
<p>Could it be that there’s something wrong with these two Companion Beasts? Zhou Wen took out the Lady Luck Necklace and the Black Bear Spirit Companion Egg and carefully studied them, but he didn’t discover any problems.</p>
<p>How strange. Has Jing Daoxian suddenly changed? Zhou Wen couldn’t trust the situation.</p>
<p>“Liu Yun, do you know who Lord Fourth is?” Zhou Wen sent a message to Liu Yun, hoping to figure out if Liu Yun knew the truth.</p>
<p>“Lord Fourth is Lord Fourth. Why? Is there a problem?” Liu Yun quickly replied.</p>
<p>“Nothing.” Zhou Wen didn’t ask further.</p>
<p>If Jing Daoxian didn’t wish for others to know that it was him, it was normal that Liu Yun couldn’t tell. Even Zhou Wen hadn’t been able to tell at the beginning. It was only when Jing Daoxian deliberately spoke in his own voice that Zhou Wen had identified him.</p>
<p>“What happened? Are you alright?” Liu Yun sent another message.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. Let’s put the matter of Lord Fourth aside for now. I’ll inform you when I’ll carry out the job in the future.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and sent another message: “Do you have a way to contact Teacher?”</p>
<p>“No… Why don’t you ask Zhong Ziya? Perhaps he has a solution,” Liu Yun replied.</p>
<p>“Got it.” Zhou Wen opened his contact list and found Zhong Ziya. He sent a message: “Is there a way to contact Teacher?”</p>
<p>“No.” Zhong Ziya quickly replied. It was a simple word, and he didn’t say anything else.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sent Hui Haifeng and Jiang Yan the same message. Hui Haifeng said that he hadn’t seen Wang Mingyuan since the Holy City incident.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan didn’t reply.. His situation was unknown.</p>
