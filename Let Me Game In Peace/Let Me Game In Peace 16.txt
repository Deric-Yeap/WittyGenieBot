<h3 id='chapter1500'>Chapter 1500 A Guest Arrives</h3>
<p>“Cooperate in what?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement when he saw that it was Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>“Don’t you know? Four people are needed to enter Dubhe; no more, no less.” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you are really that suicidal? Everything on Dubhe is an unknown, wouldn’t entering be courting death?” Zhou Wen didn’t believe that now was a good time to enter Dubhe.</p>
<p>If he rashly entered without knowing the situation inside, even a Calamity-grade creature might not be able to come out alive.</p>
<p>“Of course not now. I just want you to be mentally prepared. I’ll inform you when the opportunity comes,” Jiang Yan said. “I really have to think about it,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“Nothing to ask?” Jiang Yan sent another message.</p>
<p>“You’ll tell me what you can and won’t tell me what you can’t.” Zhou Wen replied calmly.</p>
<p>“There are many things that we haven’t confirmed. There’s no point in saying anything. However, this might be a chance to reverse the passive situation.” Jiang Yan replied.</p>
<p>“What passive situation?” Zhou Wen didn’t understand what Jiang Yan meant.</p>
<p>“Think about it yourself.” Jiang Yan replied after sending a message. Zhou Wen held his phone and carefully read Jiang Yan’s message again. He found the sentence interesting. It had a myriad of possibilities that ranged from something trivial to something major.</p>
<p>If it’s something that’s most important… Zhou Wen thought carefully and found it unlikely.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pondered for a moment before an idea came to him. He wanted to visit Dubhe.</p>
<p>Of course, he couldn’t do so using the Cube. Other humans might find it difficult to reach Dubhe, but Zhou Wen wasn’t one of them. Singularity Universe’s interstellar teleportation ability would easily allow him to reach Dubhe.</p>
<p>With his defenses, he could reach the vicinity of Dubhe without entering it. The high temperature of Dubhe shouldn’t be able to injure him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen mainly wanted to see if there was a tiny palm symbol in Dubhe’s dimensional zone. This was the most important thing to him.</p>
<p>However, space was just too dangerous. Who knew if there were terrifying cosmic creatures waiting for an opportunity near Dubhe.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and decided to take Chick with him. The Dubhe was hot, a perfect stage for Chick.</p>
<p>However, without Chick, it would be too dangerous for Guide City if the skeleton legion appeared again. Typical Companion Beasts couldn’t be too far from their owners. The Dubhe was too far away. It was impossible for him to leave a Companion Beast to watch over the base.</p>
<p>This is troublesome. The baby bear looks silly and I don’t know how strong it is. I definitely can’t let it watch over the base. Unfortunately, the antelope didn’t come to Guide City. Otherwise, I would be at ease with it in school. After some thought, Zhou Wen couldn’t think of a good idea. He was afraid that something would happen to Guide City while he was away.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, what’s going on? Why didn’t you invite me over when there was such a fun place?” Just as Zhou Wen was considering the matter, he suddenly heard a familiar voice.</p>
<p>Before long, Li Xuan kicked open the yard door and swaggered in.</p>
<p>“Can’t you wait for me to open the door?” Zhou Wen said gloomily, but he realized that Li Xuan hadn’t come alone. There was someone behind him.</p>
<p>“Qin Zhen? Why are you together?” Zhou Wen saw that the person who had followed Li Xuan was the famous Female Sword Immortal, Qin Zhen.</p>
<p>“Don’t misunderstand. We were heading in the same direction. She’s here for you,” Li Xuan said with a cheeky smile.</p>
<p>“Senior, I heard that you are establishing a human city in Guide City. Is the school still lacking teachers?” Qin Zhen asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. However, the remuneration we provide here can’t compare to Sunset College’s. As you can see, there’s no answer to when the school will return to normal,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I just need a place to stay,” Qin Zhen said seriously.</p>
<p>“What are you considering? Hurry up and arrange a place for her to stay,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Alright. As long as you are willing to stay, I won’t treat you unfairly in the future.” Zhou Wen was in need of help. A sword expert like Qin Zhen had been a tutor at Sunset College to begin with. It was a rare opportunity.</p>
<p>Qin Zhen didn’t say anything else and only nodded.</p>
<p>“I’ll find you a place to stay.” Just as Zhou Wen was about to settle them in elsewhere, he heard a voice coming from outside the yard.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, if you don’t mind, count the two of us in.” Two more people walked in following the man’s voice.</p>
<p>“Tian Xiangdong, Fang Ruoxi, why are you here?” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be surprised when he saw his two former classmates.</p>
<p>Just like Zhou Wen, they had been admitted into Sunset College. However, Zhou Wen didn’t graduate. The two of them had left Luoyang after graduation. As they hadn’t contacted each other, Zhou Wen didn’t know where they had gone after graduation.</p>
<p>However, having not seen them in Guide City, Zhou Wen imagined that they had moved to another city.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? This is our hometown. When our hometown is in trouble, we naturally have to come back to support it.” Tian Xiangdong chuckled. “Actually, I’m working in the Federation’s political commentary department now. The higher-ups want me to be their informant and report any information gathered.”</p>
<p>Fang Ruoxi also said bluntly, “My situation is about the same. If there’s anything that’s not too important, leave it to me. I will do what I can for my hometown.”</p>
<p>The two of them made themselves clear and handed the choice to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen smiled and said, “It’s naturally best to have free labor. Come with me. I’ll find a place for you to stay.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid that the other factions would send spies. It was pointless fearing that. Even if it wasn’t Fang Ruoxi and Tian Xiangdong, there would be other spies.</p>
<p>Instead of wasting time guessing who the spy was, it was better to keep Fang Ruoxi and Tian Xiangdong. Regardless of whether they were doing it on account of sentiment or not, they were still very good workers. They were all elites who had graduated from Sunset College and were in the government departments.</p>
<p>The school didn’t have plenty of room left, but Zhou Wen still managed to arrange a single room for them. Although it was a room changed from a school office, it was the best he could offer under the present conditions.</p>
<p>Qin Zhen didn’t mind at all. She tidied up the room and put down her luggage before going over to Zhou Wen and asking, “Senior, what can I do?”</p>
<p>“No rush. Get some rest for today. There will be many things waiting for you in the future,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>Qin Zhen nodded and surprisingly returned to her room to rest.</p>
<p>“This junior isn’t bad,” Li Xuan said with a smile as he walked.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1501'>Chapter 1501 Dubhe</h3>
<p>When Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were alone at Zhou Wen’s residence, Li Xuan said, “Old Zhou, what are your plans? Don’t tell me you really want to establish a human city here? Although this is your hometown, there’s no barrier here. There are unexplored dimensional zones everywhere. You can’t stay here forever, right?”</p>
<p>“I originally wanted to find a dimensional zone to establish a city, but unfortunately, I haven’t found a suitable place for the time being. I can only make do here for the time being,” Zhou Wen said as he stroked the baby bear’s back.</p>
<p>“I did some research on the nearby dimensional zones before coming here. There really aren’t any suitable places to build a city. Originally, Guide Ancient City was a good choice. Once the city gates are closed, it wouldn’t be easy to storm in. But that place is now too dangerous. There’s no way to enter, much less build a city,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“If it was that easy to establish a city, this place would have long been occupied by others. The various factions are eyeing this place covetously, but they haven’t done anything yet. I know how difficult it is to establish a city here.” Zhou Wen also knew that it wasn’t easy to establish a city here.</p>
<p>“Since you are aware of all of this, why are you erecting a city here?” Li Xuan looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“What’s the point if it’s easy?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>Li Xuan curled his lips and said disdainfully, “Do you think I don’t know what kind of person you are? If it wasn’t for something interesting, would you be setting up a city here? I think if you have the time and energy, you’d rather play games in bed.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen laughed. “You know me the best. I won’t hide it from you. Guide Ancient City has something very important to me, but I currently don’t have the ability to retrieve it. Therefore, I have to establish a city here and guard it, so as to prevent the item from falling into the hands of others. Do you still remember what you said back then about establishing a city that belongs to us? How about it? Stay behind. This city will be ours.”</p>
<p>“You’re full of nonsense. Why else would I be here? Do you think this is a tourist attraction?” Li Xuan curled his lips.</p>
<p>“That’s good. I can be relieved with you around,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? From what you’re saying, you want to be the boss that shirks responsibility?” Li Xuan immediately felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>“That’s not what I meant. However, I do wish to make a trip to Dubhe to take a look,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Sure, but don’t enter,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“I know. Familiarize yourself with the situation here. I’ll make a trip when you are done.” Zhou Wen planned on giving Li Xuan some time.</p>
<p>“Do you think our Li family’s intelligence network is useless? I’m afraid I know the situation here better than you. Alright, go do what you need to do. Leave this to me. With Qin Zhen’s help, nothing will happen as long as a Calamity doesn’t descend,” Li Xuan said smugly.</p>
<p>“Is your brother alright?” When Li Xuan mentioned the intelligence network, Zhou Wen thought of Li Mobai. The Li family’s intelligence network had nothing to do with Li Xuan. It was all built by Li Mobai.</p>
<p>“He’s fine. He’s doing very well. He eats, sleeps, and curses. If it wasn’t for his eyes still in the cabinet at home, I would have wondered if he was blind. He’s even more normal than a normal person, so normal that he appears a little sick,” Li Xuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>“I cultivate in an Essence Energy Art with healing abilities. I can try to see if I can heal his eyes,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“It’s useless. He said it himself. His eyes are Ghost God Eyes. Healing abilities can’t treat it, and he’ll be like that for the rest of his life. However, he also said that looking at things doesn’t necessarily need eyes. It’s even more useless looking at people with eyes. Therefore, it doesn’t matter if he has eyes or not.” When Li Xuan said that, he looked somewhat helpless.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen guessed that Li Mobai was definitely educating him in a reprimanding tone when he said that.</p>
<p>The two chatted a lot more. The next morning, Zhou Wen summoned Qin Zhen, Fang Ruoxi, and company and introduced Yu Qiubai and the other core members to them, making it easier for them to work in the future.</p>
<p>Before leaving, Zhou Wen took Chick away, but he didn’t tell the others that he was leaving for a period of time.</p>
<p>Apart from Li Xuan, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on letting anyone know about this matter.</p>
<p>He would be back soon if everything went well. There was no need to alarm the others.</p>
<p>After returning to his room, Zhou Wen used Singularity Universe’s teleportation ability with Chick. With Dubhe as his target, he teleported over.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen finished his teleportation, his vision was filled with light and flames. The temperature was terrifyingly high. Despite wearing the Prisoned Dragon armor, Zhou Wen still felt his body heat up.</p>
<p>Chick seemed excited as it opened its mouth and sucked. Large swaths of flames around it surged into its mouth and into its stomach like spring water.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately felt the temperature around him drop significantly. He focused his gaze and realized that he was very close to Dubhe. The flames that surged upwards from the planet were like fountains that reached a height that exceeded where Zhou Wen was levitating. Even steel would instantly melt.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pushed Truth Listener’s ability to its limits and flew close to the huge planet with Chick.</p>
<p>This planet was many times bigger than the sun. Wherever Zhou Wen flew, there were flames everywhere. The dazzling light made his eyes feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>With Chick around, the high temperature was bearable. The nearby flames were swallowed by Chick.</p>
<p>He didn’t discover any dimensional zones within his detectable range. However, the light and fire Essence Energy on this planet were extremely terrifying. What was even more terrifying was that there was a planet nearby that emitted a terrifying glow.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had long heard that Dubhe was a binary star-meaning that it had a companion star-he was still shocked when he saw it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen failed to find any dimensional zones after circling the two stars for quite some time, much less the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>Strange. Could it be that the dimensional zone is inside the planet? If that’s the case, it will be difficult to find the dimensional zone without entering through the Cube. Zhou Wen looked at the planet that was even more terrifying than the sun. If he wanted to rush in, he wasn’t sure if the Prisoned Dragon armor could withstand it.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over how to find the dimensional zone, he suddenly saw Chick’s feathers stand up as it stared intently at the flames below.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Zhou Wen traced its gaze and saw a huge shadow flickering in the flames.</p>
<p>It was like a giant whale in the sea. He could only see a shadow, not enough to determine what it was.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wish to take the risk as he watched it swim in the flames. The shadow looked bigger than an aircraft carrier. He planned on returning to Earth with Chick.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, Chick suddenly let out a long cry and spread its wings to rush towards the shadow in the flames.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1502'>Chapter 1502 Chick Starting A Fight</h3>
<p>“Don’t be rash!” Zhou Wen wanted to stop Chick, but it was already too late. Chick was too fast as it rushed into the flames.</p>
<p>Chick’s entire body burned with phoenix flames. It was still dazzling amidst the already dazzling flames as it quickly charged at the gigantic figure.</p>
<p>Roar! The liquid on the planet spewed out, producing a terrifying glow and releasing massive amounts of energy. The explosion and radiation were accompanied by a terrifying shockwave and light spots. Instantly, all Zhou Wen saw were all sorts of strange light blasts. His vision became useless.</p>
<p>The Prisoned Dragon armor was affected by the terrifying energy. The armor turned red like a piece of red-hot metal at high temperatures.</p>
<p>The constantly erupting shockwaves sent Zhou Wen’s body into a retreat. As he retreated, Zhou Wen saw a monster’s head that resembled a rainbow crystal extend out from the various energy explosions. Just its head was comparable to an aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>It widened its mouth and devoured Chick who had flown into the flames. It was unimaginably huge.</p>
<p>Chick was like an ant in the monster’s mouth. It was close to being devoured.</p>
<p>A phoenix cry tore through space as Chick flapped its wings. Its phoenix flames burgeoned as every golden feather spewed out golden phoenix flames, instantly melting Chick’s body.</p>
<p>A huge golden flaming phoenix appeared, flapping within the monster’s mouth. Space seemed to distort as Chick slid out of its mouth the instant the monster closed it.</p>
<p>Its actions were extremely elegant and light. It didn’t seem fast, but it managed to escape the monster’s lightning-like bite.</p>
<p>The monster’s figure rushed out of the liquid. Its body was like a rainbow-colored glass whale. It had horns on its head and wings on its back. It looked strange and beautiful.</p>
<p>Although it was huge, it didn’t appear bloated. Its contours were smooth as they exuded indescribable power.</p>
<p>Chick dodged the monster’s bite and circled around the flames. The surrounding flames condensed towards its body, causing the phoenix flames on its body to burn brighter and brighter.</p>
<p>It went from slow to fast, from stillness to movement, from grace to swiftness. Instantly, Chick’s speed increased to its limits. It was like a golden blade of light that crisscrossed the monster.</p>
<p>Chick appeared behind the monster, and a long golden burn mark appeared on its abdomen, as though it was a melted magma dyke.</p>
<p>Nicely done! Zhou Wen was overjoyed. Chick’s strike seemed to have sliced open the monster’s abdomen. The monster had probably been severely injured.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw the monster’s flames burn as the wound on its abdomen rapidly healed the very next second. It flapped its wings and infinite flames rose, forming a huge flaming barrier that enveloped the nearby area.</p>
<p>The barrier’s range was too large. It was already too late by the time Zhou Wen realized it. His body was trapped in the barrier as the energy inside constantly erupted. It was as though countless hydrogen bombs were exploding as they filled the area with light blasts.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body slammed into the barrier as the Prisoned Dragon armor turned redder. If not for its Absolute Defense, it would have long been destroyed.</p>
<p>What level is this fellow at? Just the power in the domain is already so terrifying! Zhou Wen used spatial instant transmission to rush out of the barrier to avoid the outcome of both armor and human dying.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this barrier can’t block spatial powers. Zhou Wen stood outside the barrier domain and could still sense the terrifying energy inside.</p>
<p>The fire phoenix formed by Chick constantly danced in the light, leaving behind golden phantoms that constantly flashed around the monster. It left a long burn mark on the monster every time.</p>
<p>However, as fire-elemental creatures, the monster’s fire-elemental immunity and self-healing abilities were equally terrifying. The injuries Chick left on its body weren’t enough to injure it.</p>
<p>After the monster unleashed the barrier, it stopped attacking Chick. It floated in the barrier and allowed Chick to attack it.</p>
<p>However, the barrier constantly shrank. As the barrier shrank, Chick’s range of activity decreased, and the energy blast within the barrier intensified.</p>
<p>If one looked at it with their naked eyes, the barrier was like a miniature sun, and it was a miniature sun that was constantly shrinking.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that Chick’s situation wasn’t going south. Chick looked very strong, but it ultimately hadn’t reached the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>The reason Chick could exchange blows with the monster was that it was a phoenix with a top-notch fire-elemental bloodline. This could almost be considered its home ground. The monster also had fire-elemental powers, so Chick was immune to its fire-elemental powers. It could even absorb them, allowing it to fight the monster.</p>
<p>The problem was that no matter how strong Chick was, it was still much weaker without entering the Calamity grade. If it was imprisoned, it would be impossible for it to fight the monster head-on.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors and threw them at the barrier.</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrm Scissors instantly cut a hole in the barrier and rushed into it, but the hole in the barrier was immediately filled with flames.</p>
<p>None of this was important to Zhou Wen. His target wasn’t the barrier to begin with, but the unknown monster.</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrm Scissors transformed into a golden beam that slashed at the rainbow-colored glass-like monster. With a crack, the monster’s massive body couldn’t withstand the Golden Wyrm Scissors. It was sliced into two.</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrm Scissors is too amazing! Zhou Wen was gratified. It was worth combining the three Calamity-grade creatures.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen immediately realized that something was amiss. The monster had been sliced into two, but the barrier domain didn’t vanish. Furthermore, it was still shrinking. This meant that the monster wasn’t dead.</p>
<p>Indeed, large amounts of flames spewed out from the monster’s severed body. The flames on both sides intertwined, causing its body to fuse together again.</p>
<p>“Golden Wyrm Scissors, kill it.” Zhou Wen ordered the Golden Wyrm Scissors to attack again.</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrm Scissors was activated again as they transformed into golden beams of light that slashed at the monster.</p>
<p>The monster didn’t dodge. The Golden Wyrm Scissors snipped off its head into two, but still failed to kill it. Its head quickly fused again.</p>
<p>Chick also used its wings to attack the monster again and again. The blade- like wings left wounds on the monster’s body, but they quickly recovered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown. The Golden Wyrm Scissors was very powerful, but due to the limitations of his Essence Energy, he could only produce a maximum of three Clean Breaks when he used all his strength. Then, he needed time to recover his Essence Energy</p>
<p>He had already used Clean Break twice in a short period of time. If he still couldn’t kill the monster with a final strike, he could only give up.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was in thought, the Golden Wyrm Scissors had already used all its strength to slice apart the monster’s tail using their third Clean Break.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1503'>Chapter 1503 The Golden Wyrm Scissors Shows Its Prowess</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen reeled with anxiety. He couldn’t help but feel greatly disappointed when he saw the monster’s tail heal.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen saw the Golden Wyrm Scissors split into two the next second. Their might didn’t show any signs of weakening. It looked like their Essence Energy remained abundant, and there wasn’t any problem of Essence Energy depletion.</p>
<p>How did this happen? Zhou Wen was first taken aback before he immediately thought of the reason.</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrm Scissors’ Calamity Zone was called True Gold Fire Refinement. Zhou Wen never understood what use this Calamity Zone had.</p>
<p>This was because no flames were produced when he got the Golden Wyrm Scissors to use its Calamity Zone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen finally understood that the power of the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ domain seemed to be effective only in flames.</p>
<p>How can there be such a strange domain? Wouldn’t this domain be useless if the place didn’t have any flames? Yet, it really came in handy. I’ll write this off as luck. Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrm Scissors exerted its powers again and again, as though it didn’t need to worry about Essence Energy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also discovered a strange phenomenon. The Golden Wyrm Scissors’ body was slowly changing. The golden scissors became heavier and heavier as the scales on the wyrm’s body became more and more crystalline.</p>
<p>He took out his phone and took a look. Indeed, he realized that the various stats of the Golden Wyrm Scissors had increased.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen understand that the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ Calamity Zone wasn’t a combat domain. It was considered a zone that allowed self-evolving through the power of the flames.</p>
<p>The monster was probably at the Hell level as well. Coincidentally, it was fire-elemental. Under the high temperature of Dubhe, it allowed the Golden Wyrm Scissors to unleash its strongest might.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, Zhou Wen hoped that the monster could be killed later. He wanted to use its Calamity Zone to help the Golden Wyrm Scissors raise its stats.</p>
<p>Even if it couldn’t advance to the Heaven level, he could raise its basic stats to the peak of the Hell level.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already summoned his sniper rifle, but he put it away when he saw this situation.</p>
<p>After being attacked again and again, the monster also realized the danger. It no longer suffered a beating passively. High-temperature beams shot out from its eyes as it spat out high-temperature energy bullets.</p>
<p>However, such an attack wasn’t of much use to Chick and the Golden Wyrm Scissors. Instead, it gave the Golden Wyrm Scissors better tampering, significantly increasing its stats.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen became fonder of the Golden Wyrm Scissors as he watched on. It was very suitable for combat in such an environment. Their powerful offensive strength, coupled with the evolutionary domain, only made them stronger. I’ll probably need the Golden Wyrm Scissors to be my primary force when clearing the Dubhe dimensional zone in the future, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>The monster could only blame it on its luck. It was clearly at the Hell level, but of all creatures, it encountered Chick and the Golden Wyrm Scissors. It couldn’t unleash the combat strength and suppression it should have.</p>
<p>This also made Zhou Wen understand that even if one reached the Calamity grade, creatures with the strength of a single system would find it difficult to unleash their full combat strength when facing their nemesis.</p>
<p>There was no absolutely invincible power in this world. Every power had a nemesis. The ability the Lost Immortal Sutra gave Zhou Wen undoubtedly gave him a huge advantage.</p>
<p>Although he might not be able to crush peers at his level and there might be someone who could match Zhou Wen in some aspects, Zhou Wen would have a huge advantage in relatively complicated environments and battles. It was almost impossible for him to be restrained as he could adapt to various combat situations.</p>
<p>Ordinary people definitely couldn’t fight like Zhou Wen. They could only use Companion Beasts and other methods to make up for their flaws.</p>
<p>However, compared to Companion Beasts, Zhou Wen had a greater advantage. Few people on Earth had a Calamity-grade Companion Beast.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder so many people wanted Venus’s Companion Beast. There are many stars in the Universe. As long as I fight in such an environment, the Golden Wyrm Scissors can produce extremely powerful combat strength. Unless there’s an overwhelming disadvantage, they’ll become stronger the more they fight. Zhou Wen looked at the stats on his phone. As the barrier domain shrank, the energy in it erupted stronger. The Golden Wyrm Scissors’ stats increased.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrm Scissors snipped off the monster’s body again, but this time, the sound was somewhat strange.</p>
<p>As the monster’s body cracked, the barrier shattered. The energy inside scattered and quickly vanished.</p>
<p>The monster’s body had already been snipped into two several times, but this time, it was somewhat different. Its two halves were rapidly collapsing rather than fusing.</p>
<p>The massive glass-like body constantly shattered as the crystal turned to dust. It melted under the celestial body’s high temperature as its body gradually plummeted.</p>
<p>Chick let out a long cry as it grabbed half of its crumbling body with one claw and dragged it into space.</p>
<p>Even without the high temperatures, the monster’s body rapidly disintegrated. Soon, there were only two halves of a crystal ball. The crystal ball didn’t collapse as strange energy flowed inside.</p>
<p>It was likely that the monster died only after the crystal ball was hit by the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ Clean Break.</p>
<p>Chick cried out in joy as it flew over and swallowed the two halves of the crystal ball.</p>
<p>Soon, the phoenix flames on Chick’s body became thicker and thicker. Finally, they formed an egg-shaped barrier that constantly shimmered with light.</p>
<p>Is it about to advance to the Calamity grade? Zhou Wen called out a few times, but he didn’t receive any response from Chick. He knew that Chick might have entered an evolutionary state again.</p>
<p>He reached out and stored Chick in its egg form into the Chaos Bead. Zhou Wen looked at the Golden Wyrm Scissors floating beside him. Although he couldn’t count on Chick anymore, with the Golden Wyrm Scissors, there shouldn’t be much danger as long as he didn’t enter the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen decided to continue searching to see if he could find the dimensional zone on Dubhe.</p>
<p>As he searched, he checked the information on the Golden Wyrm Scissors and realized that its four stats had already reached 267. If that monster hadn’t died too early, it would have increased even more.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen attempted to get the Golden Wyrm Scissors to enter the high-temperature area of Dubhe, but as Companion Beasts couldn’t be too far from their owners and Zhou Wen didn’t dare go too close, the Golden Wyrm Scissors also found it difficult to venture deep. The surface temperature wasn’t of much help to its evolution.</p>
<p>The Dubhe was massive. Zhou Wen searched for a long time but didn’t find any traces of the dimensional zone. All he could do was teleport to the other companion star to take a look, but he still didn’t find anything.</p>
<p>Strange, why can’t I find the dimensional zone? Zhou Wen knew that there had to be a dimensional zone that could be reached through the Cube, but he couldn’t find it outside.</p>
<p>Could it be that the entire dimensional zone is inside Dubhe? In that case, I probably won’t be able to enter the dimensional zone without sufficient fire-elemental defensive equipment. Zhou Wen was already thinking about where to get such immunity-providing equipment. It would be best if it was at the Calamity grade.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1504'>Chapter 1504 Four-Star System</h3>
<p>It wasn’t completely impossible for Zhou Wen to enter, but he didn’t wish to take the risk.</p>
<p>It took quite some time to search both celestial bodies. Just as Zhou Wen was about to return, his heart suddenly stirred. The Dubhe is one of the Big Dipper stars. Now that Dubhe has changed, have the other six stars changed as well?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that it wouldn’t be a problem to take a look.</p>
<p>The stars that humans could see in the night sky were mostly stars, not planets or other celestial bodies. The other six stars of the Big Dipper were also stars. Although they were somewhat different from Dubhe, the environment of the stars was somewhat similar.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen teleported over, he only took a look from a close distance, but he didn’t discover any dimensional zones.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the sixth star, Mizar, he didn’t discover anything beyond it. He even deliberately looked at the companion star, Alcor.</p>
<p>Mizar was a famous binary star. Its companion star, Alcor, was one of the few binary stars that could be resolved with the naked eye on Earth. As Alcor had a lower magnitude, it was used in ancient times to test the eyesight of soldiers. To be able to see this star was believed to have a visual acuity of 20/12.5.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen found Alcor, he realized that there wasn’t only one companion star nearby, but three.</p>
<p>The two pairs of stars revolved around each other. It was far more complicated than what he had seen on Earth. It was a four-star system.</p>
<p>The four stars revolved according to a certain trajectory, allowing for a scene of four suns rising at the same time. It looked extremely magical. Earth was in a single star system, so it was impossible for it to see such a scene.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly thought of an ancient myth. Legend had it that the sun was a Golden Crow. And in the past, there wasn’t only one Golden Crow, but ten. Under the restrictions of the Celestial Thearch, only one Golden Crow came out every day to provide light to the land.</p>
<p>However, there was once a time when ten Golden Crows appeared together, nearly roasting the ground dry.</p>
<p>A god, Hou Yi, shot down nine Golden Crows with divine arrows, leaving only one Golden Crow to bring light to the land.</p>
<p>If this wasn’t just a legend, but an actual event, Zhou Wen wondered if it was possible that the Solar System was a ten-star system that possessed nine other Companion Beasts at some point in time.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen was only musing. After all, Companion Beasts didn’t randomly appear, much less come and go as they pleased. Even if they really existed, who could really shoot down nine stars?</p>
<p>Furthermore, a 7-star system was the most that had been found to date. 10-star systems had yet to be found.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen chose one of the stars because he wanted to take a look. However, when he teleported near the celestial body, he was surprised to discover a monument erected on</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>The monument didn’t look like metal or jade. It was unknown where it was made. Erected on the celestial body, the terrifyingly high temperature and energy blasts couldn’t damage it at all.</p>
<p>Most of the monument was enveloped by flames and high-temperature magma, but the exposed parts were thousands of meters tall. It was black like metal, and it was densely engraved with symbols that Zhou Wen didn’t recognize.</p>
<p>The tiny palm symbol! Zhou Wen looked at it for a while and realized that there was a tiny palm symbol on the side of the monument. He was overwhelmed with a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>He quickly took out his phone and snapped a picture of the tiny palm symbol. Immediately, the phone entered the download screen.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I only have one of Mizar’s stars. It’s not Dubhe that appeared on the Cube, Zhou Wen thought regretfully.</p>
<p>As the download didn’t show any signs of completion and Zhou Wen didn’t wish to waste any time, he circled all four stars before heading to the last of the seven stars-Eta Ursae Majoris.</p>
<p>In the end, the stone monument was found only on one celestial body, not elsewhere.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took quite some time to make such a huge trip. Based on Earth’s calendar, it took him a few days, but the dungeon didn’t finish downloading.</p>
<p>Downloading the Venusian instance dungeon didn’t take that long previously! Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>There was no point in staying any longer. Zhou Wen teleported back to Earth and looked at the time. He realized that he had been away for more than half a month.</p>
<p>However, compared to interstellar travel that could easily be measured in light-years, Zhou Wen’s teleportation ability was already crazy enough. His trip wasn’t long at all.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that Guide City had changed drastically when he returned.</p>
<p>The people who were originally crowding near the school were living in the nearby city. They weren’t camping outside the school.</p>
<p>Li Xuan is pretty good. I never expected him to have such talent! Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be alarmed when he saw that everyone was behaving in an orderly manner without the panic from before.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen returned to school and went straight to Li Xuan. He realized that there were two people who were chatting with Li Xuan in his room. Zhou Wen wasn’t unfamiliar with the two of them. One was Feng Qiuyan, and the other was Ming Xiu.</p>
<p>When Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan saw Zhou Wen, they stood up and shouted in unison, “Coach.”</p>
<p>“Why are you guys here?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Coach, I heard that you wish to establish a city. My family got me to come over to take a look. If possible, they plan on moving over,” Ming Xiu said.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan also nodded and said, “My family plans to do the same. Coach, if you establish the city, I hope you can leave some space for my Feng family.”</p>
<p>“Are you guys joking?” Zhou Wen knew that the two of them had terrifying strength. Furthermore, with the strength of their families, they had their own cities to begin with. There was no need for them to join Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Even if they really wanted to choose a place to settle in, the conditions the six families and even the various warlords could provide them were much better than Zhou Wen’s.</p>
<p>“Coach, I’m really not joking,” Ming Xiu said with a smile. “Although our Ming family is in quite a comfy environment, it’s a pity that there isn’t much room for development in that area. The lack of dimensional zones’ resources has already limited the Ming family’s future achievements. We have long been searching for suitable locations. Since you want to establish the city, I naturally won’t miss such an opportunity.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid you don’t know much about Guide City’s situation, right? It’s not that easy to survive here. It’s still unknown if it can be built.” Zhou Wen wasn’t completely confident that he could build a city here, nor did he wish to lie to them.</p>
<p>“Danger and opportunity are two sides of the same coin. How can we gain anything if we don’t take risks? Our Ming family has long studied the situation in Guide City. To be honest, our Ming family had considered occupying Guide City in the past, but we ultimately gave up because of a lack of confidence. Ignoring our Ming family, even the six families wouldn’t dare set up a city here.”</p>
<p>Ming Xiu paused for a moment before saying solemnly, “Now, all the major factions are waiting to see your outcome. No one thinks that you can really establish a city here, but I think that you will definitely be able to get a foothold here. Therefore, no matter what the family chooses, I will stay here.”</p>
<p>“Me too,” Feng Qiuyan added succinctly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1505'>Chapter 1505 The Strangeness of the Wind God Cave</h3>
<p>“The two of you… Don’t blindly… make a decision… Think about it again…” Zhou Wen originally wanted them not to blindly believe in him, but after some thought, it didn’t seem appropriate to say that. He changed his mind at the last minute.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu smiled and said, “It’s not blind faith. We know that there are risks, but all investments carry risks; high risk, high reward. We think we can bet on you, Coach.”</p>
<p>“Whatever suits you. Don’t regret it if you lose the bet.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and asked Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan, “What’s your cultivation level now?”</p>
<p>Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan’s eyes lit up while their expressions turned solemn. Ming Xiu said, “I’ve already advanced to the Terror grade. The Mythical Serum I used was created from a temporal dimensional creature. It’s quite a coincidence. It was originally a Calamity creature, but when it was released, something happened. It was invaded by an enemy and was severely injured. I lucked out by touching it while it was on its deathbed. I got Senior Haifeng to help me create the Mythical Serum. Now that I’ve advanced to the Terror grade, the Terror transformation ability I obtained is Temporal Arbitration…”</p>
<p>Everyone’s Life Providence, Life Soul, Wheel of Destiny, and Terror transformation abilities were their greatest secrets. However, Ming Xiu explained his abilities in detail in front of Zhou Wen without any intention of hiding them.</p>
<p>“Coach, do you think there’s anything I need to correct?” Ming Xiu looked at Zhou Wen with anticipation.</p>
<p>“You have your own ideas and cultivation direction. Furthermore, I’m not good at temporal powers. It’s not appropriate for me to give you any suggestions.” Zhou Wen paused before saying, “However, if you want to advance to the Calamity grade, you can pay attention to temporal dimensional zones. You might gain something.” “Coach, you actually know how to advance to the Calamity grade. That means you should have already advanced to the Calamity grade, right? I understand, Coach. In the future, I’ll especially search for some temporal dimensional zones to train myself. I hope I can comprehend time. I hope I can advance to the Calamity grade as soon as possible like you.” Ming Xiu nodded in enlightenment.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan continued, “Coach, I’ve also advanced to the Terror grade, but my situation is somewhat special. My Mythical Serum comes from the Wind God Cave that our Feng family guards…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t too surprised when Feng Qiuyan told him the details of his situation.</p>
<p>Back then, Feng Qiuyan had summoned a very strange Companion Beast. It was said to be from the Wind God Cave protected by the Feng family. Zhou Wen had long felt that it wasn’t simple.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan originally wanted to hunt a dimensional creature that was suitable for him in the Wind God Cave before creating the Mythical Serum.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, the magical Companion Beast on him led him deep into the Wind God Cave. There was a strange cave there with a small pool at its bottom. It had a little spring water inside.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan was pushed into the pool by his Companion Beast. When he came out, the spring water in the pool had already dried up, and he had advanced to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Later, Feng Qiuyan went to look for Hui Haifeng. After Hui Haifeng helped him check his body, he told him that his physical condition had advanced after using the Mythical Serum. The clear spring water was likely a natural or man-made Mythical Serum. Even Hui Haifeng couldn’t tell what type it was.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan’s Essence Energy didn’t seem to have any special attributes, but at times, it could produce unbelievable power.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan himself wasn’t too sure of the attributes of his powers. He had always cultivated with the wind elemental in mind, but the power of his Terror form had nothing to do with wind. Its name was Rebellious.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu still had some traces of influence from a dimensional creature’s bloodline. For example, his ears looked a little like cat ears. As for Feng Qiuyan, there was no sign of the effects of the Mythical Serum. He was no different from a human who hadn’t used one.</p>
<p>“Coach, should I cultivate in a wind-elemental dimensional zone?” Feng Qiuyan asked Zhou Wen in anticipation after explaining his situation.</p>
<p>In fact, Feng Qiuyan had previously been to dimensional zones where many wind-elemental creatures appeared, but the effects weren’t ideal.</p>
<p>“Let’s find a place to first show me your powers.” With Feng Qiuyan’s description, he couldn’t tell what Feng Qiuyan’s powers were, so he decided to take a look.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen didn’t believe that he could teach Feng Qiuyan anything. He only wanted to help him figure out what attributes his powers belonged to.</p>
<p>“It’s been a long time since I received your personal guidance. Count me in,” Ming Xiu said excitedly.</p>
<p>When Li Xuan saw Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan looking extremely excited, he thought to himself, Could it be that these two fellows are born masochists? Do they feel uncomfortable not being beaten up? If that’s the case, they should learn from me. Why are they looking for Old Zhou? My skill at enduring beatings suits them better. However, it’s too late for them to change to my Essence Energy Art now. What a shame for these two good seedlings.</p>
<p>The four of them and a bear arrived at an uninhabited spot in the wilderness. When the baby bear saw Zhou Wen return, it had stuck to him and refused to leave.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was away, he got Li Xuan to help take care of the baby bear. The baby bear was barely willing to let Li Xuan approach it, but the moment Zhou Wen returned, he ignored him.</p>
<p>“An ingrate… To think I fed you so many good things… Pui…” Li Xuan muttered gloomily.</p>
<p>“Coach, please enlighten me.” Feng Qiuyan summoned his saber. At the same time, a mysterious force circulated around his body as though the wind was flowing around him, causing his clothes and long hair to dance.</p>
<p>What kind of power is this? It even has a hairdryer effect? Zhou Wen looked at Feng Qiuyan in envy. He looked like an immortal riding the wind, exuding an indescribable elegance.</p>
<p>However, Feng Qiuyan didn’t think too much about it as he slashed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s eyesight was definitely top-notch at the Terror grade, but at the instant Feng Qiuyan’s saber slashed out, it vanished from his vision, making it difficult for him to keep up with the saber’s speed.</p>
<p>This left Zhou Wen somewhat alarmed. However, even though Feng Qiuyan’s saber could make Zhou Wen’s vision unable to keep up, he couldn’t escape Truth Listener’s enhanced hearing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended two fingers and instantly clamped the blade that Feng Qiuyan had slashed out. The blade was less than three centimeters away from Zhou Wen’s neck.</p>
<p>“Again,” Zhou Wen said to Feng Qiuyan as he released his fingers.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan seemed to expect it. After sheathing his saber, he attacked Zhou Wen again. Feng Qiuyan’s saber was terrifyingly fast. It was already close to the speed of a Calamity-grade. Furthermore, as he constantly struck out with his saber, his saber speed constantly increased.</p>
<p>However, this speed wasn’t enough to injure Zhou Wen, but it already left him somewhat alarmed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1506'>Chapter 1506 Coach’s Gift</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen only defended without attacking. He could handle the attacks easily in the beginning, but at any moment, Feng Qiuyan’s saber speed would become faster and faster. This gave Zhou Wen no choice but to activate the power of Human Sovereign and raise his physical stats to the Calamity grade. Only then could he suppress Feng Qiuyan in terms of speed, preventing him from hitting him.</p>
<p>This fellow’s saber is really fast-abnormally fast. It should be related to his Terror transformation ability, right? However, his powers don’t seem to be purely wind-elemental… Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu’s eyes lit up as he watched from the side. He subconsciously moved his toes back and forth, having the urge to join the battle.</p>
<p>“As expected of Coach. If I want to defeat Old Feng, I can’t let him have a chance to deliver more than three strikes. Otherwise, I’ll definitely lose. However, no matter how many strikes Old Feng strikes, he can’t even touch Coach’s clothes. This is no longer an existence on the same level,” praised Ming Xiu.</p>
<p>Li Xuan curled his lips and said, “Aren’t you spouting nonsense? You and Little Yanyan were taught by Old Zhou. It would be strange if you could hit him.”</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan had spoken too soon. He originally imagined that no matter how fast Feng Qiuyan’s saber was, there was ultimately a limit. It was impossible for it to reach the speed of a Calamity-grade.</p>
<p>However, this pattern clearly didn’t apply to Feng Qiuyan. In the end, Feng Qiuyan’s saber speed really broke through the speed of light. It was a speed that only a Calamity-grade could reach.</p>
<p>How does this fellow do it? From the looks of it, the Wind God Cave isn’t simple. There’s more to the thing inside. Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. To reach the speed of light at the Terror grade was definitely not something an ordinary Terror creature could</p>
<p>do.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to visit the Wind God Cave. If he could find the tiny palm symbol, he would be in for a killing.</p>
<p>If I let Feng Qiuyan’s saber speed increase as he continues slashing like this, I might not be able to dodge it. I should quickly end it. With a thought, Zhou Wen extended two fingers into the saber beam and grabbed the blade that resembled a stream of light.</p>
<p>Instantly, the swift saber came to an abrupt halt.</p>
<p>At the same time that Zhou Wen grabbed the saber, Feng Qiuyan’s legs went limp as he fell to the ground. He panted heavily as sweat gushed out. It made him look like he had just come out of a bathtub. His clothes were drenched and he looked like he had been enervated.</p>
<p>“As expected of Coach. You could even tell that I had reached my limit and ended the battle at the right time, preventing me from over-exerting myself.” Feng Qiuyan felt somewhat ashamed and felt that he shouldn’t have continued fighting.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen released his fingers that were holding the saber and used Truth Listener to scan Feng Qiuyan’s body. Seeing that he had just expended too much energy and hadn’t injured his body, he immediately felt relieved. However, he muttered inwardly, What are the attributes of Feng Qiuyan’s powers?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen failed to figure out what Feng Qiuyan’s attributes were despite the long observation. It looked like the power of wind, but it was somewhat different.</p>
<p>They aren’t anything like Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth, nor are they spatial or temporal. There don’t seem to be any special attributes. They seem to be somewhat similar to my Dao Sutra and Qi Refinement Sutra, but there are also some differences. If I have to give an answer, they are much more similar to the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. However, my Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation has the power of an array formed from multiple skills combined. His power is singular, but it’s so similar to the power of the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. This is somewhat odd.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t too sure because Feng Qiuyan’s powers were actually very different from his Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. It wasn’t completely the same.</p>
<p>“Coach, how can I make myself stronger?” Feng Qiuyan was still panting as he asked Zhou Wen eagerly. His stamina had yet to recover.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what Feng Qiuyan’s powers belonged to, so it wasn’t appropriate for him to spout nonsense. However, when he saw Feng Qiuyan’s expectant gaze, he couldn’t bear to say that he didn’t know.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen said to Feng Qiuyan, “I’ll give you a small item. Take it and take a look. Perhaps you will gain something.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Zhou Wen took out a coin and circulated the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation to attach to the coin.</p>
<p>The coin instantly spun like a spinning top. When Zhou Wen released his hand, the coin floated in the air and kept spinning as though it was being propelled by infinite power. It showed no signs of falling.</p>
<p>“Coach, don’t worry. I definitely won’t disappoint you. I’ll figure out the mystery behind this,” Feng Qiuyan said as he stared at the spinning coin as though he had obtained a treasure.</p>
<p>“It’s just a trinket. Just take a look. There’s no need to mind it too much.” Zhou Wen didn’t know if this could help Feng Qiuyan figure out his powers. However, studying the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation was definitely not a bad thing. With Feng Qiuyan’s high talent, he might gain some insight.</p>
<p>“Coach, you’ve already given Old Feng something. Shouldn’t you give me something too? You can’t favor one over the other!” Ming Xiu shamelessly asked for something.</p>
<p>“I’m really not good at temporal powers. I’ll give you one move.” Zhou Wen pointed at Ming Xiu.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu extended his hand to block, but he realized that he couldn’t block Zhou Wen’s fingers. The sword beam that bloomed on Zhou Wen’s fingers appeared half a beat later and flew past Ming Xiu’s cheek.</p>
<p>“Isn’t this my Tomorrow Sword Art? Coach, you’ve made it much stronger than mine!” Ming Xiu couldn’t help but be secretly delighted. Zhou Wen had actually practiced his Tomorrow Sword Art. Although he had higher attainments than him, it was still his sword art after all. He felt honored that Zhou Wen was willing to practice it.</p>
<p>“This isn’t Tomorrow Sword Art. Its name is Spacetime Bandit. You can use it to verify your Tomorrow Sword Art. Perhaps you will gain something.” Zhou Wen told Ming Xiu some key points of Spacetime Bandit.</p>
<p>As he didn’t have the skill crystal, Zhou Wen couldn’t teach it to Ming Xiu. All he could do was tell him some of his experience. Whether he could use it depended on him.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan acted as though they had obtained a treasure and stopped pestering Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen led the baby bear and Li Xuan back as Li Xuan explained the situation in Guide City in detail.</p>
<p>It turned out that in the past half a month, Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan weren’t the only ones who had come. Many experts had come to Guide City as well. Only then could Li Xuan stabilize it. Otherwise, just the manpower they had wouldn’t have been enough to defend such a large area.</p>
<p>Those experts came from different places. Most of them were sent over by the various factions. Hui Haifeng had also sent quite a number of people over. There were more than ten Mythical experts who had advanced using the Mythical Serum. What gave Zhou Wen a headache was that Hui Wan had also come.</p>
<p>Is Hui Haifeng crazy? He sent his only son to such a place? Zhou Wen felt his head ache.</p>
<p>“Hui Haifeng got Hui Wan to deliver a message. He said that it’s safer for his son to be with you than with him,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, Hui Haifeng isn’t that comfortable being president.” Zhou Wen could only shake his head with a bitter smile.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1507'>Chapter 1507 Descent Through the Corpse</h3>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Dark clouds gathered in the sky as bolts of lightning crisscrossed. A bolt struck the ground, creating a huge crater in the wilderness which revealed coffins.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Another bolt of lightning struck one of the coffins.</p>
<p>The coffin was made of some unknown wood. When the lightning struck it, sparks flew and enveloped the entire coffin, but it didn’t damage it at all.</p>
<p>Lightning bolts descended one after another, but as though they were individually sentient, they landed on five different coffins.</p>
<p>Lightning flashed over the five coffins. After a while, the lightning surrounding the coffins vanished. The dark clouds and storm in the sky also dissipated.</p>
<p>With a few soft sounds, the lids of the five coffins were slowly pushed open. The corpses sat up in the coffins.</p>
<p>Although they were corpses, their bodies were no different from living people. There were no signs of decay. Apart from the lack of a heartbeat, it was impossible to tell that they were dead.</p>
<p>The five corpses crawled out of the coffins. Four of them bowed at another corpse and said, “Your Excellency Berserker Immortal, those fellows from the League of Guardians must have never expected that we had long left a backup plan on Earth. They thought that we had to rely on them and Skysplit Tower. Do you want to visit the League of Guardians to teach them a lesson?”</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal glanced at his body and said coldly, “The power these five ancient corpses can withstand is limited. The power of a Calamity-grade will cause irreversible damage to them. Once we lose the protection of these ancient corpses, the rules of Earth will deal too much damage to us. Therefore, our goal is to find a new representative. There will be plenty of opportunities in the future to teach them a lesson. Furthermore, we still need them to rebuild Skysplit Tower. It’s not appropriate to let them know that we have other methods to descend to Earth for the time being.”</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, according to the information we previously received, there are many warlords on Earth, but many are wanting. In the East District, the An family in Luoyang is the strongest. Their strength is enough to fight the big families like the six families. It even vaguely feels like it can surpass them. If it can be used by us, it will naturally be the best choice. However…” One of the ancient corpses didn’t finish his sentence.</p>
<p>“If you have something to say, just say it. It’s not the style of the four immortals of the arts.” Berserker Immortal said indifferently.</p>
<p>Due to the League of Guardians’ slow progress in repairing Skysplit Tower, Berserker Immortal didn’t want to be limited by others. In order to escape Wang Mingyuan’s restrictions, he didn’t hesitate to use the Immortals’ trump card in the Mythical era. He wanted to find a new representative as soon as possible to replace the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>As he had used an ancient corpse to descend, his strength was limited by the ancient corpse’s physique, preventing him from unleashing Berserker Immortal’s true strength. To be safe, Berserker Immortal had even invited the four immortals of the four arts to descend with him.</p>
<p>The four immortals—Zither, Chess, Calligraphy, and Painting-were all at the Calamity grade. Although they hadn’t reached the Heaven level like Berserker Immortal, they were still existences at the Hell level. Even if they were affected by the ancient corpses and couldn’t unleash their full strength, they were not to be underestimated.</p>
<p>Calligraphy Immortal who had just spoken continued, “However, Wang Mingyuan comes from Luoyang. It’s difficult to guarantee that he has nothing to do with the An family. Furthermore, Zhou Wen, who is hand in glove with the An family, is one of Wang Mingyuan’s disciples. It doesn’t seem appropriate to choose the An family.”</p>
<p>Painting Immortal continued, “Although the An family didn’t resist contracting Guardians, they are more inclined towards developing technology. They aren’t very enthusiastic about contracting Guardians. The chips in our hands aren’t that attractive to the An family.”</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal quietly listened to them before saying, “The An family has already reached such a state. It won’t be easy to rope them. Furthermore, there’s the risk of exposing our trump cards to Wang Mingyuan.”</p>
<p>The four immortals believed that Berserker Immortal had no intention of targeting the An family, but to their surprise, Berserker Immortal changed the topic and continued, “Now that Zhou Wen has already left the An family and wants to establish a city in Guide City, this is an opportunity. To establish a city in a place like Guide City, even the An family might not be able to succeed. Furthermore, Zhou Wen is alone. Now is the most difficult time for him. It’s also our best chance.”</p>
<p>“But Zhou Wen is Wang Mingyuan’s disciple. Isn’t that inappropriate?” The four immortals looked at each other, clearly doubting Berserker Immortal’s decision.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal said indifferently, “The best way to defeat an enemy is to destroy his confidence. The reason Wang Mingyuan shows such arrogance in the dimension is that his disciples control almost all the strongest factions on Earth. We have no other choice. If we can destroy the assets he’s so proud of, Wang Mingyuan will definitely be in a mess. It will be up to us whether we kill him or not.”</p>
<p>Thinking back to Wang Mingyuan’s slap, an indiscernible killing intent flashed in Berserker Immortal’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen is Wang Mingyuan’s disciple after all. How can we ensure that he will be used by us and not go against us like Jiang Yan?” Calligraphy Immortal said after some thought.</p>
<p>“It’s precisely because even Wang Mingyuan can’t think of it that it’s more valuable. In comparison, Zhou Wen, who has left the An family, is the easiest to deal with among Wang Mingyuan’s disciples. As long as I can crush his will, I’ll take him for myself using the Art of Immortal Opportunity. I definitely won’t allow any accidents to happen,” said Berserker Immortal.</p>
<p>When the four immortals heard that, they revealed looks of enlightenment. Painting Immortal said with a smile, “I never expected you to be able to use the Art of Immortal Opportunity. We are relieved.”</p>
<p>Calligraphy Immortal pondered for a moment and said, “I heard that the Art of Immortal Opportunity is somewhat similar to a contractual art. It can only be used if the other party is willing to accept it. Your Excellency, how do you plan on subduing Zhou Wen?”</p>
<p>“The easiest moment to breach a person’s defenses is when they are in danger. It’s very easy for something to happen in a place like Guide City, isn’t it? When he is facing an insurmountable problem, we will descend from above to save him from danger. It will naturally be effective,” Berserker Immortal said as he headed for Guide City.</p>
<p>The four immortals understood what Berserker Immortal meant and hurriedly followed.</p>
<p>At that moment in Guide City, Zhou Wen looked at Hui Wan with a headache.</p>
<p>The Essence Energy Art Hui Wan cultivated was Zhou Wen’s Qi Refinement Art. The greatest characteristic of this Essence Energy Art was the need for extravagance. As long as one had enough Essence Energy Crystals, there was basically no threshold that prevented one from advancing all the way to the Epic stage.</p>
<p>Hui Wan’s family was so poor that all they had left was money. He could use all sorts of high-level Essence Energy Crystals. At a young age, Hui Wan had already advanced to the Epic stage. He was just short of advancing to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng didn’t rashly get Hui Wan to use a Mythical Serum. He had sent Hui Wan over firstly to ensure his safety, and secondly, to get Zhou Wen to help him choose a path.</p>
<p>Hui Wan was Hui Haifeng’s only son. Apart from Zhou Wen, Hui Haifeng was worried about leaving Hui Wan’s future to others.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1508'>Chapter 1508 Super AI</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen could roughly guess Hui Haifeng’s thoughts, but this matter gave him a headache.</p>
<p>It was impossible to gather the nine Life Providences and nine Life Souls and advance to the Mythical stage as a pure human. At the very least, Zhou Wen hadn’t discovered any other method other than the Lost Immortal Sutra.</p>
<p>The only path left was Spirit Casting, Mythical Serum, and Guardian contracting.</p>
<p>In the past, Spirit Casting and Mythical Serum were indeed good choices. Hui Haifeng was also an expert in producing Mythical Serums. It wasn’t difficult to create a Mythical Serum that was suitable for Hui Wan to raise his success rate.</p>
<p>However, Hui Haifeng didn’t do it. Instead, he handed Hui Wan over to Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen roughly guessed that Hui Haifeng wasn’t completely confident of success. Hui Haifeng didn’t wish to take it even if there was only a 1% risk.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the crux of the problem. The crux was that Zhou Wen had heard from the humanoid monster in Ancient Sovereign City that it was best if humans could ensure the purity of their bloodline.</p>
<p>If the premise was to ensure the purity of the bloodline, contracting a Guardian was a more suitable path.</p>
<p>Therefore, after some thought, Zhou Wen felt somewhat stumped.</p>
<p>“Master, I’ve tried many times and used a large number of high-level Essence Energy Crystals, but I just can’t advance to the Mythical stage. Did I do something wrong?” Hui Wan came in front of Zhou Wen and took out his notebook. As he asked Zhou Wen, he recorded his teachings.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, It would be a surprise if you could advance to the Mythical stage. In ancient times, this was called the limits of the Deva Realm. Since ancient times, there haven’t been many humans who could break through the limits of the Deva Realm with their pure human bodies. As far as Zhou Wen knew, even Human Sovereigns like Suirenshi couldn’t do it. Among the people Zhou Wen knew, other than himself, only Jing Daoxian had that possibility, but it was impossible to confirm that he advanced to the Mythical stage with a pure human bloodline.</p>
<p>“Show me your Life Providence and Life Soul,” Zhou Wen said, unwilling to dampen Hui Wan’s enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Hui Wan put away the notebook and stood up. He circulated the Qi Refinement Art and quickly condensed his Qi, turning it into a Life Soul that floated in front of him.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” Zhou Wen sized up Hui Wan’s Life Soul and found it odd.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen cultivated the Qi Refinement Art, the Life Soul he condensed was Sword Pill. The Life Soul Hui Wan condensed was completely different from his. Not only was it not Sword Pill, but it wasn’t a blade or saber. It looked like a phone no matter how he looked at it.</p>
<p>“Your Life Soul is a cell phone?” Zhou Wen sized up the Life Soul and asked.</p>
<p>“It’s not a phone. You can call it a Super AI.” Hui Wan explained the detailed abilities of his Life Soul.</p>
<p>The more Zhou Wen listened, the more he found it odd. Hui Wan said that it wasn’t a phone, but many of the functions of this Life Soul were similar to a phone. Hui Wan could even connect to the Federation’s Internet through his Life Soul.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that this thing could also quickly crack all kinds of passwords. Opening an electronic lock was very simple. The bank vaults that used high-tech protective equipment were no different from naked beauties in front of Hui Wan’s Life Soul.</p>
<p>Of course, this wasn’t the only effect of the Super AI Life Soul. There were many other uses, but they had nothing to do with combat.</p>
<p>“Your Life Soul is somewhat special. Can you enter the Zhang family’s server to search for information with this Life Soul?” Zhou Wen asked Hui Wan.</p>
<p>Currently, the server controlled by the Zhang family had the highest encryption and defense in the Federation. No one had been able to hack into it to search for information.</p>
<p>“Of course. I’ve accessed it a few times before, but there wasn’t much interesting content inside. I only found a few pill formulas and spirit talisman creation methods. There wasn’t much else of value,” Hui Wan said to Zhou Wen as he skillfully got the Super AI Life Soul to connect to the Internet.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could say a word, he saw plenty of data appear on the Super Al’s screen. Clearly, it had succeeded.</p>
<p>“You’ve done this a lot in the past, right? Have you seen the private servers of the other families?” Zhou Wen knew that Hui Wan had done this quite a number of times when he saw how adept he was.</p>
<p>“I’ve taken a look, but there aren’t many interesting things. The various families have the intention of keeping important information in equipment without network access. Most of the information I can find is useless,” Hui Wan said casually.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, You sure are gutsy. It’s no wonder the Hui family has been doing so well recently. Although Hui Haifeng doesn’t have much power in the Federation, he has been advancing step by step. He has been doing well and hasn’t made any major decision mistakes. I reckon some of this is thanks to Hui Wan.</p>
<p>“This is the first time I’ve seen a Life Soul like yours. I need to consider it before giving you some suggestions. Before that, you should learn more combat techniques,” Zhou Wen said half-truthfully.</p>
<p>“I’m already very familiar with my combat techniques…” Hui Wan said confidently.</p>
<p>“Actual combat techniques aren’t something that can be mastered with practice. Actual combat naturally needs to be honed through actual combat. How about this? Go to your Uncle Li Xuan and get him to arrange for you to participate in the defense. You can continue training on the battlefield.”</p>
<p>When Hui Wan heard that he could enter the battlefield, his eyes lit up. “Can it really be done? Dad has always refused to let me participate in real battles. He only wants me to fight those dimensional creatures at home. It’s so boring.”</p>
<p>“Of course. I call the shots here. It’s useless even if your father comes,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Long live Master! I can finally go on the battlefield!” Hui Wan immediately became excited. At that moment, he looked like a child.</p>
<p>After sending Hui Wan to Li Xuan, Zhou Wen was still worried. He deliberately gave Li Xuan a call to ensure Hui Wan’s safety. This was Hui Haifeng’s only heir. He couldn’t die here.</p>
<p>After hanging up, Zhou Wen picked up the mysterious phone and realized that the dungeon hadn’t been downloaded successfully. It was still the download screen.</p>
<p>Strange, why is this dungeon so huge? Could it be that the dungeon I downloaded this time isn’t a single Alcor, but a dimensional zone of the entire Big Dipper? Otherwise, it wouldn’t have taken so long to download a single dungeon. Zhou Wen was very suspicious.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was studying it, he received a message from Li Xuan saying that something had happened in the Dubhe instance dungeon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly launched the livestream app on his phone. On the homepage, there were many streamers livestreaming the Cube. He clicked on one and indeed, he discovered a problem.</p>
<p>Previously, the scene of the Cube had been fixed on Dubhe that constantly emitted flames. However, at that moment, the scene of the Cube seemed to rapidly sink into Dubhe’s extremely hot celestial body.</p>
<p>Soon, the scene was completely filled with dazzling bursts of light. However, not long after, the scene suddenly darkened, and a strange palace appeared on the Cube’s screen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1509'>Chapter 1509 Dubhe Dimensional Zone</h3>
<p>The palace was purple, as though it was carved from purple jade. Only a door was revealed. The subsequent parts were in the high-temperature liquid that constantly radiated light.</p>
<p>There were only strange patterns on the door, but no words were found. It was unknown what the name of the dimensional zone was.</p>
<p>In front of the door stood a majestic creature.</p>
<p>Is that thing a dinosaur? Zhou Wen looked at the creature in front of the palace in surprise.</p>
<p>It had long hind legs and short front claws. Its tail looked like a lizard’s and its mouth was filled with razor-sharp teeth. No matter how one looked at it, it looked like a Tyrannosaurus from Earth’s prehistoric civilization, not a western dragon or flying dragon.</p>
<p>There were many dinosaur fossils on Earth, but up to now, there was no uniform explanation as to why the dinosaurs had gone extinct.</p>
<p>The creature that had appeared at the palace’s entrance was like the Tyrannosaurus in movies. However, what was different from the movies was the Tyrannosaurus’s red body that was burning with red flames.</p>
<p>The dimensional zone on Dubhe is indeed in its interior. That Tyrannosaurus can break through the high temperature and radiation outside to reach the entrance of the dimensional zone, so it should be at the Human Realm at the very minimum, right?</p>
<p>The Tyrannosaurus had already slammed into the palace door while Zhou Wen was still in thought.</p>
<p>The door to the palace was slammed open by the Tyrannosaurus with a loud boom. However, there was a resplendent orange-red light inside. Nothing could be seen.</p>
<p>The Tyrannosaurus rushed through the door without any hesitation. The Cube’s screen finally became clearer, allowing everyone to see the scene inside the palace.</p>
<p>Huge pillars propped up the massive palace. There were a total of twenty-four pillars in two rows. Each pillar seemed to be carved from amethyst and was more than a meter in diameter.</p>
<p>Furthermore, every amethyst pillar had a mysterious symbol engraved on it. One couldn’t tell what the mysterious symbol represented for the time being.</p>
<p>At the end of the two rows of pillars, at the back of the palace, sat a creature wearing amethyst armor. As his entire body was enveloped by amethyst armor, Zhou Wen didn’t know what he looked like or if he looked like a human.</p>
<p>The Tyrannosaurus roared and charged at the amethyst-armored creature sitting there the moment it rushed into the palace.</p>
<p>Its hind legs exerted strength as it charged forward like light. Its speed wasn’t inferior to Zhou Wen’s.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had long expected it to be at the Calamity grade. It wasn’t surprising that it had such speed.</p>
<p>The Tyrannosaurus rushed in front of the amethyst-armored creature, but the latter continued sitting as before. It was like an old monk in meditation, motionless. The Tyrannosaurus’s gaping mouth was lined with razor-sharp teeth. It was about to bite the helm.</p>
<p>The amethyst-armored creature raised its hand and pressed it on the Tyrannosaurus’s chin in a split second.</p>
<p>This was the last scene Zhou Wen saw. In the next second, a light blast erupted like a volcano. The Tyrannosaurus’s body and the entire palace were drowned by it.</p>
<p>When the light dimmed, the Cube’s screen had already returned to the outside of Dubhe. It meant that the Tyrannosaurus was dead and hadn’t successfully cleared the level.</p>
<p>The Calamity-grade Tyrannosaurus wasn’t even able to withstand a single strike. What’re the origins of that fellow in the amethyst armor? Zhou Wen was secretly surprised. At the same time, he was somewhat glad that he hadn’t rashly entered Dubhe’s dimensional zone. Otherwise, he would have been vaporized by the terrifying strike.</p>
<p>Although the footage inside the palace was very short, the amethyst armor on the creature left a deep impression on Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The mysterious purple color appeared noble and beautiful in the radiance. It was as crystalline as the divine battle armor worn by gods, but it was impossible to see what kind of creature was inside the armor.</p>
<p>That armor should be at the Calamity grade, right? Zhou Wen was somewhat tempted. The armor looked like it had a very powerful defense against the fire element.</p>
<p>Of course, that was only a musing thought. Before figuring out the origins of the amethyst-armored creature, Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to take the risk to head to Dubhe.</p>
<p>Although the Tyrannosaurus was killed in one strike, it finally allowed people to see the dimensional zone of Dubhe. All the major media outlets scrambled to report the amethyst-armored creature.</p>
<p>People were guessing the origins of the amethyst-armored creature and whether it had anything to do with the myths involving Dubhe.</p>
<p>Some people studied the killed Tyrannosaurus. They wanted to verify if the Tyrannosaurus was related to the dinosaurs on Earth. They hoped to crack the mystery of the dinosaurs’ extinction.</p>
<p>Mount Mandang, also known as Fairy Peak.</p>
<p>It was here that the Han dynasty’s Liu Bang slew the White Snake uprising and became the hegemon of history.</p>
<p>After the dimensional storms, Mount Mandang became an extremely complicated large dimensional zone. It contained many small dimensional zones that were somewhat similar to Dragon Gate Grotto.</p>
<p>This was originally under Guide City’s jurisdiction, but few people came here after the dimensional storms. Even if someone came here, it was highly unlikely that they would return.</p>
<p>At that moment, there were five expressionless people standing in front of the Snake Slaying Monument. The person in the lead was reading the tablet text on it. It was none other than Berserker Immortal and company. “Zither Immortal, I’m counting on you,” Berserker Immortal said indifferently as he looked at the Snake Slaying Monument.</p>
<p>Zither Immortal, behind him, responded and sat in front of the Snake Slaying Monument. He took on a zither-playing posture, but there was no zither in front of him.</p>
<p>Zither Immortal strummed his fingers in the air. Despite having nothing but air, Zither Immortal’s fingers produced faint music from his finger plucking.</p>
<p>The sound of the zither was like immortal music. Even someone who didn’t know music could sense the beauty of the zither music.</p>
<p>Accompanying this beautiful zither music was a strange sound coming from Mount Mandang. Not long after, dimensional creatures that looked like wandering ghosts walked out of the mountain, and their numbers constantly increased.</p>
<p>When the wandering dimensional creatures passed by Berserker Immortal and company, they didn’t even spare them a glance. It was as though Berserker Immortal and company didn’t exist as they headed straight for Guide High School. More and more wandering and wild ghosts rushed out of Mount Mangdang, forming a tidal wave-like army. Their numbers were uncountable.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>A terrifying sound suddenly came from the depths of Mount Mandang. Before long, a huge white snake that resembled a dragon swam out from the mountain range’s depths. Wherever it passed, wandering ghosts either automatically ducked or were crushed by it.</p>
<p>The white snake was crystalline-white. It wasn’t ugly–when it raised its head, it gave off an elegant beauty.</p>
<p>“I never expected that there would be a Calamity creature in Mount Mandang.” Upon seeing the white snake, Berserker Immortal was somewhat surprised. He hadn’t known that there were Calamity creatures here. He had originally just planned on releasing the wandering ghosts inside to attack Guide High School.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1510'>Chapter 1510 Danger</h3>
<p>A few soldiers in charge of sentry duty were surrounding a bonfire on the roof and cooking with metal basins.</p>
<p>A young man held a hard pancake in his hand. He used his hand to break it into small pieces before soaking them in a bowl of boiling water. As he ate, he asked the middle-aged man beside him, “Old Gang, how long do you think we have to endure days like this?”</p>
<p>Old Gang said, “Don’t read too much into it. If Zhou Wen hadn’t come here, Guide City would have long fallen. There wouldn’t even be food to eat.”</p>
<p>“Of course I know that this is already the best situation, but we can’t continue like this. My parents and sister live in a temporary building. If a dimensional creature rushes in, the consequences will be unimaginable,” the young man said.</p>
<p>Old Gang sighed and said, “There’s nothing we can do about that. I heard that other places use dimensional zones as natural barriers to build human cities, but the dimensional zones in Guide City are too strange. Where do you think we can build a city?”</p>
<p>“That’s true… What’s that?” The young man suddenly exclaimed in surprise.</p>
<p>The few soldiers hurriedly got to their feet and looked into the distance. They saw ghosts on the streets in the distance. There seemed to be countless wraiths wandering around as they approached.</p>
<p>“Are my eyes playing tricks on me?” Old Gang rubbed his eyes and realized in horror that a ferocious ghost was already in front of him. He fell back in fright.</p>
<p>The ferocious ghost followed like a shadow and pounced at Old Gang.</p>
<p>“Old Gang!” The young soldier beside him summoned his Companion Beast saber and slashed at the ferocious ghost.</p>
<p>However, the steel saber transformed from a Companion Beast slashed across the ferocious ghost’s body without any obstruction. It was as though the ferocious ghost was only an illusion.</p>
<p>The ferocious ghost pounced on Old Gang and immediately vanished. However, Old Gang’s eyes changed. His eyes glowed red. It was terrifyingly strange. His body was like a puppet as he stood up straight.</p>
<p>“Old Gang… What’s wrong…” Before the young man could figure out what had happened to Old Gang, ghosts landed.</p>
<p>The few soldiers brandished their weapons with all their might, but they were unable to injure the ghosts. Soon, they were pounced on by the ghosts and behaved strangely like Old Gang It wasn’t just that. There were wandering ghosts everywhere in Guide City. They rushed to Guide High School from all directions, and anyone they encountered was quickly possessed by them. “What the hell are these… Ah…” There were screams everywhere. In a short period of time, all hell had broken loose in Guide City.</p>
<p>The dimensional creatures on Mount Mandang had special attributes. They were pure souls. Typical attacks didn’t seem to have any effect on them. In a short period of time, a large number of people were possessed as they charged towards Guide High School with the legion of ghosts. The troops in charge of suppressing the ancient city were also possessed by ghosts. Not only did they stop suppressing the skeleton legion, but they also charged towards the city they were guarding.</p>
<p>The skeleton legion rushed out and wreaked havoc on the ground again.</p>
<p>At the top of an abandoned building, Berserker Immortal and company were admiring the dance of the monsters. The city was filled with screams and explosions.</p>
<p>“It’s difficult for ordinary powers to injure soul-type creatures. Although the levels of these soul-type creatures aren’t very high, it’s not that easy to destroy them. Furthermore, it will be even more difficult to destroy them after being possessed. Unless Zhou Wen is willing to kill the humans that have been possessed…” Painting Immortal said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zither Immortal added, “Originally, just these soul-type creatures were enough to leave Zhou Wen in a terrible fix. Now that the Calamity-grade white snake has appeared, even if Zhou Wen can withstand it, Guide City will definitely fall. Hundreds of thousands of people will be possessed by wandering ghosts, turning them into monsters that are neither human nor ghost. When the time comes, Your Excellency will appear to save them. Zhou Wen will have no choice but to yield.”</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal said indifferently, “To make a person like Zhou Wen serve me, this isn’t enough. I need greater pressure to completely destroy his psychological defense.”</p>
<p>“Do you plan on taking action personally?” Chess Immortal asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“Not yet. Just y’all are enough.” Although Berserker Immortal felt that Zhou Wen wasn’t someone ordinary humans could compare with, it wasn’t to the point of him personally taking action.</p>
<p>From Berserker Immortal’s point of view, Wang Mingyuan was worth him taking action. After all, Zhou Wen was only Wang Mingyuan’s disciple. The strength of any one immortal was enough to suppress him.</p>
<p>“Perhaps there’s no need for us to do anything. Just those soul-type creatures and the white snake are enough to make Zhou Wen collapse,” Calligraphy Immortal said as he looked at the burning city. Tens of thousands of people had already been possessed by wandering ghosts. At this rate, the entire Guide City would fall in less than an hour.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, and company had already rushed out from Guide High School. They were alarmed when they saw the wandering ghosts everywhere on the streets.</p>
<p>Seeing a few wandering ghosts rush over, Feng Qiuyan drew his saber and slashed. His saber wasn’t an ordinary saber, but his Life Soul. This strike sliced through the ghosts, dissipating their souls. A dimensional crystal dropped.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu’s sword also stabbed at one of the ghosts, but it passed through its body without injuring it.</p>
<p>“These are soul-type creatures. Typical physical attacks are useless.” Zhou Wen had seen such creatures before. They were basically pure spirit bodies. Physical attacks were useless.</p>
<p>Truth Listener and Chick were best at dealing with such creatures. Unfortunately, Truth Listener was still in earring form and couldn’t be released. Chick was also evolving, so it wasn’t able to be used anytime soon.</p>
<p>However, even without Truth Listener and Chick, it wasn’t difficult for Zhou Wen to deal with these soul-type creatures. What really worried Zhou Wen was the people who had been possessed by ghosts.</p>
<p>Their bodies were controlled by the ghosts as they attacked their family. They were in a dilemma as to whether to kill them or not.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of defensive barriers, Guide City had fallen too quickly. There were too many people possessed by ghosts. This was a thorny issue.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, these dimensional creatures are too f*cking annoying… The Zhang family is best at dealing with these things… But it’s too late to hire them now…” Li Xuan’s physical attacks weren’t of much use against the ghosts. All he could do was use Planet Devourer to devour them.</p>
<p>However, there were too many people here. Many people had been possessed by ghosts, and Li Xuan couldn’t devour them all. It would be too troublesome to find the ghosts one by one.</p>
<p>It was even more troublesome with the possessed ones. Li Xuan was thrown into a dilemma.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen summoned Great Brahma.</p>
<p>The Terror-form Great Brahma appeared behind Zhou Wen like a four-faced, eight-armed Buddha. He was as huge as a mountain.</p>
<p>Great Brahma had four sides. There was no sadness or joy on the front, and the back was enveloped by a black hole. The left side smiled meaningfully, while the right side wore a look of pity.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1511'>Chapter 1511 Zhou Wen Defends the City</h3>
<p>Apart from Great Brahma’s back, the other three faces didn’t have powerful offensive strength, but that wasn’t an absolute fact. They had different effects.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, Zhou Wen used Great Brahma’s frontal defense and the terrifying black hole-like power on its back. He seldom used the power from both sides.</p>
<p>Now that he saw many soul-type creatures, he could use the power of the compassionate face on the right.</p>
<p>Ordinary people couldn’t see the Terror-form Great Brahma at all, but as his lips trembled, he let out a chant.</p>
<p>Everyone heard the chanting of Buddhas. Although it wasn’t loud, nor did it have a mighty force, preventing ordinary people from feeling much when they heard it, it was enough to make the wandering ghosts let out painful wails. The low-level ghosts couldn’t withstand the pain and tumbled on the ground. White gas spewed out from their bodies as they quickly dissipated.</p>
<p>The ghosts within a radius of dozens of kilometers were reduced to white mist amidst the chanting, filling Guide City with rising white gas. Many dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs landed on the ground, but the average person wasn’t affected. “Hmph, I never expected Wang Mingyuan’s disciple to master the ability of deliverance. He must have obtained Wang Mingyuan’s help,” Zither Immortal said with a frown.</p>
<p>Deliverance powers were the nemesis of ghosts. Among the Buddha race, only a few experts had mastered them.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan was only a subsidiary of the Buddha race, not a member of the Buddha race, and he didn’t seem to have mastered the ability to provide deliverance. Zither Immortal and company never expected Zhou Wen’s Terror form to have a deliverance ability.</p>
<p>From their point of view, Wang Mingyuan was a vassal of the Buddha race. Zhou Wen had definitely received Wang Mingyuan’s help to master such an ability.</p>
<p>The people who had been possessed by ghosts also spewed out white gas. After the white gas spewed out, they fainted. Instantly, the entire city was littered with unconscious humans.</p>
<p>The people who weren’t possessed by the ghosts and the people who had woken up from their unconsciousness saw Zhou Wen floating in midair. The Buddha-like chanting came from him.</p>
<p>As for the wandering ghosts that rushed over from all directions, once they entered the range of the chanting, they quickly turned into white mist. No one could approach the vicinity of Guide High School.</p>
<p>The wandering ghosts rushed over like a tidal wave. They looked extremely terrifying, but none of the ghosts could take half a step into the pool of destruction.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen is still the best. As expected of a human expert who can enter the Cube’s ranking. He’s just too powerful.”</p>
<p>“How terrifying. It’s like a Buddha’s descent into the world.”</p>
<p>“With Zhou Wen guarding Guide City, perhaps we really don’t have to think of a way to flee to other cities.”</p>
<p>Upon seeing Zhou Wen’s might, everyone felt a lot more at ease. Many people who were in a panic gradually calmed down.</p>
<p>The troops that Li Xuan had just established were organized again to suppress the skeleton legion that rushed out of the ancient city.</p>
<p>Everything seemed to be improving. Just as everyone thought that the crisis was about to end, they saw a behemoth approaching from afar.</p>
<p>The moonlight-like brilliance easily attracted everyone’s attention. They saw an extremely huge snake with a body seemingly carved from white jade. It separated from the tide of ghosts and swam over. Just raising its head was enough to make it look like a skyscraper. The surrounding buildings looked as laughable as toys.</p>
<p>Everyone retreated in horror. Even if such a huge snake’s level wasn’t high, its physical strength was something ordinary people couldn’t match.</p>
<p>“The Buddha race’s deliverance powers are effective against ghosts, but against a creature like the white snake, they won’t be able to gain the upper hand. The chances of a Terror-grade against a Calamity-grade are slim,” Chess Immortal said.</p>
<p>The white snake flicked its tail and split a thirty-story building. Half of the building flew up and smashed in the direction of Guide High School. Humans scrambled to dodge it.</p>
<p>Such divine might left the humans dumbfounded. The power of its tail was already so terrifying. The students and ordinary people in the school fled the school in horror.</p>
<p>The entire school or even the school’s surroundings would be reduced to ruins if half a building smashed down at such terrifying speeds. Death was a certainty if they didn’t escape.</p>
<p>However, with their speed, it was impossible for them to escape the school before the building flew over. Seeing the building’s shadow rapidly envelop the school, everyone revealed looks of horror and despair. Some of the more timid girls screamed and cried.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen appeared in front of the building as Great Brahma’s god-like body appeared. He sat cross-legged behind Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The face at the back had already turned around. Eight palms blocked the building. At the same time, the black hole at the back constantly devoured the crumbling building, preventing the fragments from shooting out and injuring the people in the school.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Zhou Wen and Great Brahma which was floating in front of him as though they were looking at an immortal with a demonic slave.</p>
<p>“What powerful Terror transformation power! Thankfully, he’s only at the Terror grade. If he were to advance to the Calamity grade, I’m afraid that the white snake wouldn’t be his match,” Painting Immortal exclaimed.</p>
<p>“The stronger he is, the more beneficial it will be for us. In the future, it will be much more convenient for you to use Zhou Wen,” Calligraphy Immortal said.</p>
<p>“That’s precisely the logic. When he’s no match for the white snake in battle, His Excellency will take action. He won’t have a choice when it comes to submission,” Chess Immortal echoed.</p>
<p>As the few of them conversed, the white snake had already leaped up. Its body was huge, but its speed was unbelievably fast. It transformed into a huge white beam that rushed toward Zhou Wen in a bid to devour him.</p>
<p>Just the shockwave caused by its body breaking through the sound barrier shattered the glass in the surrounding buildings. Many buildings collapsed from the shockwave as trees were uprooted.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there were only ghosts. Otherwise, countless people would have died. Zhou Wen remained levitating in midair without any intention of dodging. He watched as the white snake arrived in front of him.</p>
<p>Just as Chess Immortal and company were wondering why Zhou Wen didn’t dodge, they saw a golden light flash from Zhou Wen’s body that met the white snake.</p>
<p>Before anyone could see what had happened, they saw that the white snake’s head had been chopped off. Blood spewed out like a fountain as Zhou Wen remained floating there without even moving his hand.</p>
<p>As for Great Brahma behind him, he extended his palm and grabbed the white snake’s head and body, preventing it from falling and smashing into the humans below.</p>
<p>“Long live Zhou Wen!”</p>
<p>“He’s utterly invincible!”</p>
<p>“So other than Human Sovereign, there are other humans who are this powerful. I was right to stay in Guide City.” “Pui! You stayed because you couldn’t leave. Do you have the shame?”</p>
<p>Everyone was amazed at Zhou Wen’s strength. The four immortals—Zither, Chess, Calligraphy, and Painting—as well as Berserker Immortal were somewhat alarmed. Although they felt that the white snake might not necessarily be able to kill Zhou Wen, they never expected the white snake to be killed by Zhou Wen in one strike. It was a Calamity creature after all. It was already shocking enough to be at the Human Realm.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1512'>Chapter 1512 Drawing A Circle</h3>
<p>“He actually has such a powerful Calamity-grade Companion Beast?” Chess Immortal said in surprise.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing strange about that. Earth is rapidly changing. Humans have already found a way to break through to the Mythical stage. It’s not impossible for top humans to obtain a Calamity Companion Beast,” Berserker Immortal said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, are we still going to other dimensional zones to lure dimensional creatures over?” Painting Immortal pondered.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. We aren’t familiar with the other dimensional zones, so we might not be able to lure the dimensional creatures out. Besides, we don’t have that much time. It’s best we meet Zhou Wen directly.” Berserker Immortal glanced at Zhou Wen in the distant sky and slowly walked towards the stairs.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen placed the white snake down and quickly realized that there was a Companion Egg and a dimensional crystal in its body.</p>
<p>The Companion Egg was obviously the white snake’s Companion Egg. As for the dimensional crystal, it was crystalline like a dragon pearl with a white snake shadow swirling inside-a skill crystal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen grabbed the Companion Egg and dimensional crystal, but the Companion Egg was a little too big. It was half the height of a person and was crystalline like white jade.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took out his phone to see what attributes the white snake Companion Beast had.</p>
<p>Although it had been sliced apart by the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ Clean Break, it was a Calamity-grade Companion Beast after all. Its skills hadn’t seemed strong when fighting the Golden Wyrm Scissors, but that didn’t mean that it wasn’t strong. There weren’t any useless Companion Beasts; their potential was fully dependent on the user. Therefore, Zhou Wen placed great importance on this Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Before taking out his phone, Zhou Wen suddenly frowned slightly and turned to look in a direction.</p>
<p>Five people came from afar. They walked in the crowd and didn’t look too conspicuous, nor did they have any special auras.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, the people in front of them would subconsciously make way for them as though this was how it should be.</p>
<p>Are these fellows human? Zhou Wen carefully observed them and didn’t discover any dimensional creature auras on them. They looked like humans.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t hear their heartbeats. How could humans not have a heartbeat?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that the arrival of the ghosts and the white snake might not be as simple as a break-out of an ordinary dimensional zone.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, what’s wrong?” Li Xuan saw that Zhou Wen’s expression wasn’t right. He traced his gaze and saw Berserker Immortal and company.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu also walked over. Clearly, they had also sensed the abnormality of the five of them.</p>
<p>This was because even the soldiers in charge of guarding the area subconsciously made way and didn’t stop the five of them.</p>
<p>“What’s their background?” Li Xuan looked at Berserker Immortal and company and whispered to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Zhou Wen shook his head slightly.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal and company came nearby just as Li Xuan was about to say something</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Li Xuan stared at them and shouted.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal ignored Li Xuan and walked to Zhou Wen. He stopped and looked at him. “I have good news and bad news for you. Which one do you want to hear first?”</p>
<p>“Good news. I don’t like tragedies,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I can help you clear Dubhe’s dimensional zone and enter the Cube’s rankings to take first place,” said Berserker Immortal seriously.</p>
<p>“Who do you think you are? Even Immortal from the League of Guardians wouldn’t dare say such things in front of us brothers,” Li Xuan said with a twitch of his lips.</p>
<p>“Immortal? He’s nothing. As long as you are willing to cooperate with me, Immortal can only bow before you,” said Berserker Immortal.</p>
<p>“Do whatever you need to do. We don’t have time to listen to your nonsense.” Li Xuan naturally didn’t believe it. Apart from Human Sovereign, the publicly recognized strongest faction on Earth was the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>As for the Holy Land’s strength, no one knew.</p>
<p>“What’s the bad news?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal said, “The bad news is that you will have to spend more time thinking about how to manage Earth’s Federation in the future.”</p>
<p>“That’s interesting. How may I address you?” Zhou Wen narrowed his eyes and asked Berserker Immortal.</p>
<p>Although Berserker Immortal didn’t emit any aura and looked like an ordinary person, Zhou Wen sensed extreme danger from him.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to know who I am. All you need to know is what I can give you,” said Berserker Immortal.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was amused as he walked over and patted Berserker Immortal on the shoulder. “Brother, you sure are good at bragging. Did you not ask around who us brothers are before you came? There’s no one on Earth who can brag in front of us brothers. Go do whatever you need to do.”</p>
<p>When the four immortals saw Li Xuan patting Berserker Immortal’s shoulder, they were immediately enraged. Just as they were about to attack, they were stopped by Berserker Immortal with a wave of his hand.</p>
<p>“I know you are considered top figures in the Federation. I’m afraid I won’t be able to convince you without showing some feats.” Berserker Immortal gestured at Painting Immortal.</p>
<p>Painting Immortal tacitly understood and walked in front of Zhou Wen and summoned a brush. Then, he drew a circle on the ground. He stood in the circle and looked at Zhou Wen. “I’ll stand here motionless. You can try your best to see if you can injure me.”</p>
<p>Others might not understand, but Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised when he saw the circle drawn by Painting Immortal.</p>
<p>The circle drawn by Painting Immortal was actually similar to his Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. They were both periodic spatial skills.</p>
<p>The circle drawn by Painting Immortal was static. It borrowed the space on the ground and was far inferior dynamically to Zhou Wen’s Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation.</p>
<p>It could be said that the skill Painting Immortal used was actually one level lower than Zhou Wen’s.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, wasn’t your Companion Beast quite powerful? You can try to see if it can injure me.” Painting Immortal stood in the circle with his hands behind his back. He looked like a sage as though he didn’t take Zhou Wen seriously.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally knew that a weapon like the Golden Wyrm Scissors was useless against such periodic spatial skills. Even if he released the Golden Wyrm Scissors, it would only circle around the ring and not injure the Painting Immortal inside.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen was good at such skills. It wasn’t difficult to crack Painting Immortal’s skill.</p>
<p>“Why? Don’t you dare?” Painting Immortal provoked Zhou Wen smugly when he saw him remain motionless.</p>
<p>“Coach, this level of competition isn’t worth you personally taking action. Let me do it.” Feng Qiuyan suddenly stood forward, hoping to request permission to fight. The Immortals didn’t think much of humans to begin with. Even Zhou Wen was only of value to them because he had been born on Earth. Without eyeing Zhou Wen, would they even think anything of Feng Qiuyan?</p>
<p>Since Feng Qiuyan addressed Zhou Wen as Coach, he was clearly a student taught by Zhou Wen. How could Painting Immortal take a fancy to him?</p>
<p>“Young man, this isn’t playing house. It will kill you,” Painting Immortal said coldly.</p>
<p>“Give it a try.” Zhou Wen saw the determination in Feng Qiuyan’s eyes as though he was very confident, so he nodded in agreement.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1513'>Chapter 1513 My Saber Is Very Fast</h3>
<p>After receiving Zhou Wen’s approval, Feng Qiuyan turned around and walked towards Painting Immortal.</p>
<p>Painting Immortal was at the Hell level. He could only barely produce strength at the Human Realm due to his possession of an ancient corpse; otherwise, it would be destroyed by Earth’s rules as punishment. He was still at the Calamity grade after all. If Zhou Wen were to fight personally, he would be more concerned with the might of the Golden Wyrm Scissors.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had actually allowed his student to fight him. From Painting Immortal’s point of view, this was an insult.</p>
<p>If not for the fact that he still needed Zhou Wen, he would have already punished him, letting him know how terrifying Calamity-grade Immortals were.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored what was on Painting Immortal’s mind. Zhou Wen knew that his strength wasn’t stronger than his from the circle drawn by him.</p>
<p>Instead, Feng Qiuyan’s initiative to fight and confidence surprised Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>I gave Feng Qiuyan the coin with the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. He should have figured out something, right? If he can figure out the trick to it, he might be able to crack the looping space. Zhou Wen looked at Feng Qiuyan, hoping to see what he had figured out from the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t have much hope. It hadn’t been long since he had given Feng Qiuyan the coin. Even if Feng Qiuyan figured out something, it couldn’t be much.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan stopped outside the circle and held his saber in his hand. He looked at Painting Immortal and said, “My saber is very fast. You have to be careful.”</p>
<p>Painting Immortal laughed and said in contempt, “Feel free to slash. Even a thousand slashes won’t be able to touch my clothes, much less one.”</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan had already warned him. If Painting Immortal continued being careless, it was not on him. He immediately stopped talking and held his saber as he stared at the Painting Immortal in the circle.</p>
<p>“Impressive aura. I hope your saber can live up to that aura.” Painting Immortal thought nothing of Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>Looping space was a high-level skill. Even among Calamity-grade creatures, there weren’t many who grasped such a skill. Even for spatial-type creatures, it was difficult to say if they could master such a skill. How could it be easily cracked by a human?</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan didn’t say a word. He drew the saber as the look in his eyes changed.</p>
<p>Fast-it was unbelievably fast.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that ordinary humans couldn’t see it clearly, even Immortal Painting saw a blur. The blade seemed to vanish from his vision.</p>
<p>However, Painting Immortal didn’t take it to heart. No matter how fast the saber was, it would be trapped in the looping space. It was impossible for it to injure him.</p>
<p>What a fast saber! It’s not easy for a Terror-grade human to master such a fast saber. I never expected Zhou Wen to have such a person by his side. Berserker Immortal was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>However, he was more delighted. Having both Zhou Wen and Feng Qiuyan under his control would be a great boon to the establishment of the Immortals’ new faction. Berserker Immortal also didn’t believe that Feng Qiuyan’s saber could break through the looping space.</p>
<p>“You can… be a little faster…” Painting Immortal was still teasing Feng Qiuyan, but before he could finish his sentence, his expression changed.</p>
<p>The golden circle on the ground magnified, forming a strange distorted space. It was as though a painting was circling around the Painter Immortal.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan’s saber slashed at the distorted picture as the saber beam sliced right through and went for Painting Immortal without stopping</p>
<p>Painting Immortal quickly retreated upon sensing the anomaly, but he was still half a beat too slow. The clothes on his chest had been sliced open by the saber, leaving a deep wound that reached his bones.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t reacted in time and retreated a distance, the saber would have already sliced his body into two.</p>
<p>“How is that possible!” The four immortals widened their eyes in disbelief as they looked at Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>That was a looping spatial skill. It wasn’t impossible to use some special ability to pass through. However, to be able to slice open the looping space with a saber-a Terror-grade human at that—made them almost believe that they were dreaming.</p>
<p>Even Berserker Immortal looked at Feng Qiuyan in a daze, momentarily at a loss for words.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also somewhat surprised. From Feng Qiuyan’s performance, he knew that Feng Qiuyan had almost comprehended his Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation and had even independently created a way to crack it.</p>
<p>Of course, this method of cracking was very ineffective against the variable Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation.</p>
<p>However, the effect on the static looping space used by Painting Immortal was excellent.</p>
<p>“So that’s all you have after bragging all day.” The glance and faint smile that Li Xuan gave Painting Immortal nearly made him find a hole to hide in embarrassment.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan returned to Zhou Wen and said in embarrassment, “I’m sorry, Coach. I’ve already tried my best, but I still haven’t completely understood what you taught me. My strike is still lacking and has let down your teachings.”</p>
<p>From Feng Qiuyan’s point of view, the looping space that Painting Immortal had set up was much simpler than the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation that Zhou Wen had instructed him to comprehend. He had actually failed to crack it cleanly and even gave Painting Immortal time to react. This was a huge oversight.</p>
<p>“You haven’t had much time to practice. To be able to do so is already considered a pass. Keep up the training when you return. Don’t make the same mistake again.” What else could Zhou Wen say? All he could do was tell him to train well in the future.</p>
<p>In any case, Zhou Wen really didn’t have anything to teach him. Feng Qiuyan’s learning aptitude was just too good.</p>
<p>Lacking? Hadn’t had much time to practice? A pass? Needs more practice? Painting Immortal and company were somewhat dumbfounded. If it wasn’t for the fact that the ancient corpses didn’t have any expressions, his face would have long twitched and deformed.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal frowned as he looked at Zhou Wen and Feng Qiuyan. He thought to himself, This Zhou Wen seems somewhat different from the intelligence I have on him. It’s really strange that one of his students has such standards.</p>
<p>Immortal Painting and company even suspected that Feng Qiuyan wasn’t a student taught by Zhou Wen, but Wang Mingyuan’s disciple.</p>
<p>It was shocking enough to have such standards even as Wang Mingyuan’s disciple.</p>
<p>However, from Feng Qiuyan’s attitude towards Zhou Wen, the respect and worship he showed were definitely not faked.</p>
<p>“Everyone, the performance has ended. If there’s nothing else, go do whatever you need to do,” Li Xuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>Painting Immortal and company looked at each other before looking at Berserker Immortal. Their emotions were somewhat odd, especially Painting Immortal. His eyes were filled with embarrassment and indignation.</p>
<p>He was a mighty Hell-level powerhouse, but he was nearly split into two by a Terror-grade human. This was a great humiliation.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal thought for a moment and gestured at Calligraphy Immortal.</p>
<p>Painting Immortal had already lost, so it wasn’t appropriate for him to take action again. Furthermore, Berserker Immortal could already tell that Feng Qiuyan was very knowledgeable about looping spaces. At Painting Immortal’s present strength, even if he tried to attack again, it probably wouldn’t be of much use considering how his abilities were restrained.</p>
<p>Calligraphy Immortal tacitly understood and took a step forward. He came in front of Zhou Wen and said, “I have a technique that I wish to seek your advice on.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Calligraphy Immortal’s attitude towards Zhou Wen was very different from before-he no longer had that condescending contempt from before.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1514'>Chapter 1514 My Sword Is Very Slow</h3>
<p>“Coach, take a break. There’s no need for you to take action against such a goon,” Ming Xiu said as he walked forward.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu knew from watching that Berserker Immortal led the group of five. Since Berserker Immortal hadn’t personally taken action, Ming Xiu didn’t wish for Zhou Wen to weaken his stance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after watching Feng Qiuyan’s battle, he felt his hands itch. He also wanted to try out his insights.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded slightly. Ming Xiu stood in front of Calligraphy Immortal and said with a faint smile, “You don’t have to be afraid. Although I studied under Coach, I’m much weaker than the previous guy. My sword is also much slower than his saber. As long as your reaction speed isn’t too bad, you should be able to block it.”</p>
<p>Calligraphy Immortal no longer underestimated his enemy like Painting Immortal. After all, the possibility of another Feng Qiuyan appearing was relatively lowthere couldn’t be many existences among the humans like Feng Qiuyan. It was already impressive for any one of the six families to produce one or two such existences. Zhou Wen was just one man. It was already shocking to have Feng Qiuyan by his side. It was unbelievable that there would be another similar expert around him.</p>
<p>Even so, Calligraphy Immortal didn’t underestimate his enemy. He thought to himself, He and that Feng Qiuyan were taught by Zhou Wen. Although one uses a saber and the other uses a sword, they probably study the same path. They should be focused on speed. Even if he’s bluffing me and his sword techniques are actually faster than Feng Qiuyan’s, I can block his attacks as long as I don’t underestimate my enemy like Painting Immortal…</p>
<p>Calligraphy Immortal thought it through and was about to say something to Ming Xiu when he suddenly saw Ming Xiu draw his sword and thrust forward. The sword was unbelievably fast, almost as fast as Feng Qiuyan’s saber.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu’s sword wasn’t slower than Feng Qiuyan’s saber. In fact, his first few strikes were slightly faster than Feng Qiuyan’s. However, Feng Qiuyan was a battle maniac. The more he fought, the stronger he became. This was a trait Ming Xiu didn’t possess.</p>
<p>If Ming Xiu wanted to defeat Feng Qiuyan, he could only rely on the first few strikes. If he couldn’t defeat Feng Qiuyan after five strikes, there was basically no need for him to continue fighting. He would definitely lose.</p>
<p>When Calligraphy Immortal saw how fast Ming Xiu’s sword was, he couldn’t help but sneer inwardly. No matter how scheming you are, it’s useless in front of absolute strength.</p>
<p>In a split second, Calligraphy Immortal summoned a book. The page opened and faced Ming Xiu’s sword.</p>
<p>Once the sword was clamped by the book, the text in the book would be imprinted on the sword, sealing the power of the sword.</p>
<p>Humans ultimately only know some tricks… Calligraphy Immortal watched as his book was about to grab Ming Xiu’s sword.</p>
<p>Calligraphy Immortal’s eyes widened the next moment. He had clearly calculated the speed and timing. The Book of Seal was just short of clamping Ming Xiu’s sword when he realized that Ming Xiu’s sword was a little slower than he had expected. He had already closed his book, but Ming Xiu’s sword hadn’t arrived.</p>
<p>It was too late for Calligraphy Immortal to open the pages again. The sword that looked a beat slower suddenly experienced a speed burst and flashed like a stream of light.</p>
<p>Pfft!</p>
<p>Ming Xiu’s sword stabbed into Calligraphy Immortal’s chest as the latter watched helplessly as the sword penetrated him, his body failing to dodge. This was because his strength was limited by the ancient corpse, preventing him from unleashing his fastest speed. He couldn’t dodge the strike that was so close to him.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu’s successful strike instantly made him retreat gracefully. It was like a pleasing piece of art.</p>
<p>Calligraphy Immortal had intended to severely injure Ming Xiu while taking the blow, but he wasn’t given the chance. Ming Xiu had already retreated, leaving only the wound on his chest.</p>
<p>Although his wound looked terrifying, no blood flowed out due to the lack of blood in the ancient corpse. Zhou Wen and company had already noticed this when Feng Qiuyan injured Painting Immortal.</p>
<p>“Thank you for thinking so highly of me. I’ve already said that my sword is very slow. You don’t have to be so fast. Just slow down and you’ll be able to block it,” Ming Xiu said coolly as he sheathed his sword.</p>
<p>Calligraphy Immortal was even more depressed than Painting Immortal from before. At the very least, he had used his Art of Cage Etching, but he hadn’t used any of his abilities. He had lost for no reason.</p>
<p>Apart from being depressed, Calligraphy Immortal and company were even more surprised.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, Ming Xiu was also a most talented and top-notch human like Feng Qiuyan. However, such human powerhouses were top-notch existences among the other major factions on Earth.</p>
<p>For example, Ya from the Holy Spirit Association and Immortal from the League of Guardians. These were existences that even the dimension knew of.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan couldn’t be much weaker even if they were weaker than Ya and Immortal. Even Berserker Immortal found it unbelievable that such people were Zhou Wen’s students.</p>
<p>They originally imagined that Zhou Wen was the weakest amongst Wang Mingyuan’s disciples. After all, Zhou Wen was alone, and the others had their own massive factions.</p>
<p>However, from the looks of it, just Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan had made Zhou Wen a faction that couldn’t be underestimated.</p>
<p>“Interesting.” Only then did Berserker Immortal seriously size up Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Although Berserker Immortal hadn’t advanced to the Apocalypse grade, he had once defeated an Apocalypse-grade creature. He indeed looked down on Zhou Wen and Earth’s strength and qualifications.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal originally wanted a puppet. He wasn’t too interested in Zhou Wen as a person.</p>
<p>But now, Berserker Immortal had no choice but to seriously examine Zhou Wen. To be able to produce students like Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan, Zhou Wen’s strength seemed to be severely incongruent with the intelligence he had previously obtained.</p>
<p>The four immortals looked at each other, momentarily at a loss.</p>
<p>Before coming here, they didn’t even think much of Zhou Wen, believing that anyone could suppress him.</p>
<p>However, two Immortals had already been defeated by Zhou Wen’s students. Even though their strength was suppressed, they still felt humiliated.</p>
<p>Zither Immortal and Chess Immortal hesitated and didn’t take action. Calligraphy and Painting Immortal weren’t weaker than them. They couldn’t even defeat Zhou Wen’s students, so how could Zither and Chess Immortal dare challenge him?</p>
<p>They had witnessed Zhou Wen using his Companion Beast to kill the white snake with their own eyes. Their bodies weren’t any stronger than the white snake’s. If the ancient corpses were destroyed, exposing them to Earth, their bodies would suffer serious injuries.</p>
<p>The four immortals couldn’t help but cast their gazes at Berserker Immortal. After all, this trip was mainly led by him. They were only assisting him, so they had to wait for him to make the decision.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal looked at Zhou Wen and company. He wasn’t as depressed as the four immortals. Instead, he was somewhat excited.</p>
<p>The stronger the people around Zhou Wen were, the faster he could establish a new Immortal faction after they came under his control. The strength Zhou Wen and company displayed was almost comparable to the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>I want these people for sure. Berserker Immortal stared at Zhou Wen with a burning gaze.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1515'>Chapter 1515 Immortal Vanquishing Palm</h3>
<p>“So that’s all there is after saying so much? Shall I entertain you? So that you can return home in peace?” Li Xuan felt his heart itch when he saw Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu in the limelight. He also wanted to be in the limelight, so he stepped forward and spoke to Berserker Immortal.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s appetite was much bigger than Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu’s. He wanted to finish off the leading Berserker Immortal.</p>
<p>Zither Immortal and Chess Immortal were enraged, having the urge to rush forward to teach Li Xuan a lesson, but they were stopped by Berserker Immortal.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll entertain you.” Berserker Immortal’s voice was calm and even carried a smiling tone, but he was already filled with killing intent.</p>
<p>He knew that it was impossible for him to easily subdue Zhou Wen and company today. He needed to suppress them with absolute strength, and Li Xuan was his opening gambit.</p>
<p>“Let’s begin,” Berserker Immortal said to Li Xuan as he stood there casually.</p>
<p>Although all of them were using ancient corpses, Berserker Immortal’s body was slightly stronger than the four immortals. It could constantly pump out strength at the Human Realm, and he could just produce a burst of strength at the Hell level.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Berserker Immortal’s realm far exceeded his peers. Even if he could only produce strength at the Human Realm, his combat strength was not something ordinary humans could compare with.</p>
<p>He got Li Xuan to attack first to give him a chance to strike.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I’ll kill you with one punch. It’s best you attack first,” Li Xuan said proudly as he stood still like a mountain. At the same time, he thought to himself, You are still too young to posture in front of me. I never lose when it comes to posturing.</p>
<p>“Is that so?” Berserker Immortal’s eyes narrowed as they landed on Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“When…” Li Xuan’s eyes suddenly widened just as he said a word. His eyes nearly popped out as he opened his mouth and spat out blood. His body curled like a shrimp.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal was already standing in front of him at some point in time and had struck his chest with a hand.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s chest sank as he hunched his body and flew backward like a cannonball. He slammed into the wall and toppled it, his body plowing a deep ravine that was hundreds of meters long.</p>
<p>Due to the speed and immense friction, the soil and bricks in the deep ditch emitted smoke. The attenuated ends of the steel columns turned dark red as though they had been burned.</p>
<p>“Silence at last. Now, we can have a good chat,” Berserker Immortal said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The surrounding people had already caught wind of the commotion, but with the soldiers stopping them, no one could come over. They could only watch from afar.</p>
<p>“What do you want to talk about? I’m all ears.” A voice sounded from a distant ravine, leaving Berserker Immortal slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal turned his head and indeed, he saw Li Xuan walk out of the deep ravine. His armor had shattered, but there were no injuries on his bare chest.</p>
<p>His firm chest and abs were exposed. They were smooth and majestic, so perfect that they didn’t look like a human’s, but like a marble statue.</p>
<p>“You should be proud to be able to withstand my strike without dying,” said Berserker Immortal.</p>
<p>Li Xuan walked over step by step and stared at Berserker Immortal. “Your strength isn’t bad, but it’s still too soft. You can try using more strength.”</p>
<p>When Berserker Immortal heard Li Xuan, his eyes sank as he broke through the sound barrier. The sonic boom blasted a huge crater in the ground.</p>
<p>Li Xuan wanted to block, but he was ultimately too slow. He was once again hit in the chest by Berserker Immortal.</p>
<p>However, this time, Berserker Immortal’s strength didn’t send Li Xuan flying. Li Xuan remained standing in his original spot, but the terrifying force penetrated his body, instantly rupturing his bones and organs.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal gracefully retracted his palm and waited for Li Xuan’s body to reduce to mud.</p>
<p>He was very confident in his strength. Although Li Xuan’s body was very powerful, even a Human Realm creature would be reduced to meat paste under his palm’s hidden force.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal stood there waiting for Li Xuan to collapse, but Li Xuan remained standing there motionless even after some time. There were no signs of him collapsing. There wasn’t even any blood seeping out of his seven orifices. This made Berserker Immortal feel that something was amiss.</p>
<p>“Is that all you got? I told you to use more strength. Why is it softer than the first palm strike? Have you not eaten? Do you want to eat something before continuing?” Li Xuan looked at Berserker Immortal and said provocatively.</p>
<p>The four immortals looked at Li Xuan in surprise. They knew about Berserker Immortal’s Immortal Vanquishing Palm.</p>
<p>Although Berserker Immortal’s palm force wasn’t as terrifying as his sword, it didn’t mean that his palm force wasn’t strong. On the contrary, it was extremely sinister. Very few creatures of the same level could withstand the hidden force of the Immortal Vanquishing Palm.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal had already used his Calamity-grade strength; yet, he failed to kill Li Xuan. Li Xuan didn’t even look injured. This left the four immortals somewhat incredulous. They even wondered if this was a dream.</p>
<p>The four immortals looked at each other and saw the shock in each other’s eyes.</p>
<p>They never expected such a situation to happen before coming here.</p>
<p>They originally imagined that it wouldn’t be difficult to suppress a factionless Zhou Wen, but the people who were beside him were each more terrifying than the last.</p>
<p>Even the League of Guardians and the Holy Spirit Association might not have so many terrifying figures. “What the hell. Where did these people come from? Why isn’t there any intelligence on them? Are the fellows from the League of Guardians doing their job?” Painting Immortal said angrily.</p>
<p>“Immortal must be up to no good. He deliberately didn’t report it,” said Zither Immortal.</p>
<p>However, Chess Immortal shook his head and said, “I don’t think so. If they are really very famous, even if the League of Guardians doesn’t report it, it’s impossible to not have any news from the Holy Temple. For there to be no news from the Holy Temple as well, it can only mean that they aren’t very famous.”</p>
<p>The attention that the dimension paid to humans was concentrated on the especially famous people like Immortal, Ya, or the Zhang family’s Zhang Chunqiu.</p>
<p>Although Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan were somewhat famous in the Federation, they hadn’t reached that level.</p>
<p>There was no need to mention Li Xuan. At home, outsiders only knew that Li Mobai was the head of the Li family.</p>
<p>When out, Li Xuan was always with Zhou Wen. He basically didn’t have any chance to showcase himself. Outsiders didn’t know that there was a figure like the Li family’s third scion.</p>
<p>But in fact, even Zhong Ziya and Qin Yan weren’t completely confident of defeating Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal’s eyes turned serious as he looked at Li Xuan and said, “It’s not bad for a human to cultivate the Invincible Connate Divine Art of the Connate Holy Temple to such an extent. Unfortunately, it’s only an incomplete fake. Ignoring a fake Invincible Connate Divine Art like yours, even if you were to master the real Invincible Connate Divine Art, you wouldn’t be able to live if I wanted you dead.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1516'>Chapter 1516 Berserk Sword Immortal</h3>
<p>Li Xuan… Zhou Wen could already tell that Berserker Immortal’s strength was extremely terrifying. He was definitely not at the ordinary Human Realm.</p>
<p>Although Li Xuan’s body was extremely powerful, there was ultimately a limit. Zhou Wen was afraid that something would happen to him, so he wanted him to stand down. There was no need for him to take the risk.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan cut off Zhou Wen and said with a smile, “How can I share half of your city without showing something? Take a good look at my performance. I won’t disappoint you.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen read Li Xuan’s thoughts through his eyes. Li Xuan clearly knew that Berserker Immortal was extraordinary. He was using him as a target to force Berserker Immortal to show his strength, giving Zhou Wen a chance to observe from the side and understand the enemy.</p>
<p>What Li Xuan meant by taking a good look at him wasn’t for Zhou Wen to look at him, but to focus on Berserker Immortal as he forced his strength out.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what’s real or fake. All I know is that you are a coward who only knows how to spout nonsense. Kill me if you have the ability.” Li Xuan suddenly unleashed his strength and threw a punch at Berserker Immortal’s nose.</p>
<p>He deliberately didn’t use the Planet Devourer because he had already realized that the Planet Devourer probably couldn’t withstand Berserker Immortal’s power. It might be destroyed if he summoned it.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal was an arrogant person to begin with. Despite knowing that Li Xuan was being provocative, he was still filled with killing intent.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal didn’t have any qualms, nor did he need to tolerate it. At the instant Li Xuan rushed in front of him, he pointed out. It was so fast that Li Xuan couldn’t see his finger move, and his finger had already touched his forehead.</p>
<p>Thousands of sword beams erupted from Berserker Immortal’s fingertip as they surged towards Li Xuan like a galaxy</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal wanted to reduce Li Xuan to dust. Under the galaxy-like sword beams, his body would be torn into tiny fragments. No matter how strong his self-healing ability was, it was impossible for him to recover under such circumstances.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal wasn’t lying. Even a Terror-grade creature that cultivated the complete Invincible Connate Divine Art would definitely be reduced to dust under his sword stream. Self-recovery was useless.</p>
<p>When the sword beams rushed into Li Xuan’s body, his entire body lit up as though his body had turned into a holographic projection.</p>
<p>The sword beams that resembled a river of stars surged through his body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen activated the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation that he had set up ahead of time. The sword beams constantly circled around an area spanning hundreds of meters, preventing any from flying out.</p>
<p>“Is this Imperial Lord Polestar’s Major Heavenly Cycle Array?” Painting Immortal was immediately given a fright when he saw Zhou Wen’s Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation.</p>
<p>Although his strength was spatial, it was still much weaker than the Major Heavenly Cycle Array.</p>
<p>“It’s not the Major Heavenly Cycle Array. It’s somewhat different, but it’s already very similar. Furthermore, there are some strange powers combined with it. Strange, very strange!” Chess Immortal said with an odd expression.</p>
<p>He knew the Major Heavenly Cycle Array well. Now that he was in it, he could easily tell what was happening.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation was somewhat different from the Major Heavenly Cycle Array. Chess Immortal couldn’t completely understand it.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Everyone suddenly heard the sound of a fist colliding with flesh. They turned their heads and saw Li Xuan’s fist smash into Berserker Immortal’s face, causing his face to contort. The latter staggered and nearly fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The four immortals were filled with disbelief. It was unimaginable that Berserker Immortal had been punched in the face by a human.</p>
<p>That was Berserker Immortal, the one who had once defeated an Apocalypse-grade powerhouse.</p>
<p>Although he was now restricted by the ancient corpse’s body and could only maintain his strength at the Human Realm, it was still difficult for them to accept such an outcome.</p>
<p>In fact, this couldn’t be blamed on Berserker Immortal. He had always believed that Li Xuan cultivated an incomplete Invincible Connate Divine Art. He knew the path of the Invincible Connate Divine Art very well, making its cultivator an existence with an invincible body.</p>
<p>However, he never expected Li Xuan’s incomplete Invincible Connate Divine Art to take a completely new path. It was already very different from the true Invincible Connate Divine Art. It was almost two completely different Essence Energy Arts.</p>
<p>The sword beams failed to injure him when Li Xuan’s body digitalized. Berserker Immortal imagined that it was an illusion, but in fact, it was Li Xuan’s actual body.</p>
<p>Be it Calligraphy and Painting Immortal, or Berserker Immortal, they subconsciously looked down on humans. If they were to fight dimensional enemies, even if it was just an illusion, Berserker Immortal wouldn’t let them get close to him.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t retreat immediately after his sword beams failed to injure Li Xuan. That was how Li Xuan managed to punch him in the face.</p>
<p>Having succeeded in his punch, Li Xuan showed no mercy. He unleashed a barrage of attacks on Berserker Immortal with his fists and legs.</p>
<p>However, before his punches and kicks landed on Berserker Immortal, a sword beam that resembled a volcanic eruption suddenly erupted from his body. The sword beam was somewhat different from before. It was the color of blood.</p>
<p>A blood-colored sword beam spewed out and shot into the sky. Li Xuan’s digitalized body was corroded upon contact with the blood-colored sword beam. His hands and legs turned blood-red and quickly exploded.</p>
<p>In his horror, Li Xuan hurriedly retreated, but his retreating speed couldn’t keep up with the speed at which the blood-colored sword beam spread. His body was about to be devoured by it.</p>
<p>His Terror transformation ability didn’t really turn him into an ethereal holographic projection. Even a real holographic projection wasn’t completely incorporeal. In fact, it was made of fundamental particles.</p>
<p>As for Berserker Immortal’s sword beam, it was so minute that it could destroy neutrinos. Li Xuan’s Terror transformation powers were unable to survive such a sword beam.</p>
<p>Just as Li Xuan was about to be devoured by the sword beam, Zhou Wen instant transmitted behind him. He grabbed his body and instant transmitted out of the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation.</p>
<p>And in the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation, Berserker Immortal slowly turned his face back and stood up straight. The sanguine light in his eyes was like a blade as the blood sword beam on his body constantly erupted like a crazy devil.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan’s previous slap had already pushed Berserker Immortal to the brink of going berserk. If not for the interests of the entire Immortal race, he would have killed Wang Mingyuan long ago.</p>
<p>However, Wang Mingyuan was the Dragon King after all, and he was now the leader of the Octokind. He had some status in the dimension, so Berserker Immortal had to put up with it.</p>
<p>Now, a Terror-grade human had actually hit him in the face. This made Berserker Immortal instantly rage.</p>
<p>As the blood sword beam on his body erupted, the ancient corpse’s body began to crack. Sanguine sword beams filled the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation as the looping space that was constantly formed by the array formation kept being torn apart.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency…” The four immortals shouted in horror as they unleashed their strength to withstand the sanguine sword beams.</p>
<p>They were still inside the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. They were the first to bear the brunt of the terrifying sword beams produced by Berserker Immortal.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1517'>Chapter 1517 Battling Berserker Immortal</h3>
<p>The Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation is about to be torn apart! Zhou Wen watched as the terrifying sword beams filled the entire Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. Even though the space in the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation could loop, there was limited space. The other party’s sword beams were so powerful that they could fill all space. It was only a matter of time before the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation was torn apart.</p>
<p>“Where did this fellow come from? He’s terrifying!” Li Xuan’s injuries rapidly healed. He had mostly recovered, but he still felt alarmed.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen had been any slower, his self-healing ability wouldn’t have been of any use.</p>
<p>“Thankfully, you made him expose his true strength ahead of time and gave us time to prepare. Now, we can think of a solution. Otherwise, the consequences will be unpredictable.” Zhou Wen sincerely felt that Li Xuan had done a good job.</p>
<p>If Li Xuan hadn’t forced Berserker Immortal to such an extent that gave Zhou Wen a chance to understand his abilities and even set up the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation ahead of time, the consequences would have been unimaginable. If Zhou Wen had really fought Berserker Immortal himself, once the latter suddenly used such strength, few nearby humans would survive even if Zhou Wen could dodge the attack.</p>
<p>“Hehe, I may not be many things, but when it comes to taking a beating, no one can be better than me,” Li Xuan said smugly.</p>
<p>“Stop bragging. Disperse the crowd. My Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation won’t last long,” Zhou Wen said to Li Xuan.</p>
<p>The Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation was on the brink of collapse. Blood-like sword beams constantly surged out from the cracked array. Everything that touched the blood-colored sword beams—be it plants or rocks—was instantly dyed red before exploding.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew very well that the objects weren’t really dyed red. It was a result of the blood sword beams being too tiny. They could directly drill into objects and destroy them at the fundamental particle level, producing such a visual effect.</p>
<p>Li Xuan, Feng Qiuyan, and company evacuated the crowd. Without waiting for the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation to completely shatter, Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors and transformed it into a golden beam that slashed at Berserker Immortal in the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal had already seen the might of the Golden Wyrm Scissors. When he saw it flash over, he immediately pointed at it with his finger, producing a sword art.</p>
<p>Following his finger were blood sword beams that surged like a tidal wave towards the Golden Wyrm Scissors.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>The vibrational sounds produced by the collision went on and on. The tiny, neutrino-like, blood sword beams constantly struck the Golden Wyrm Scissors but failed to penetrate it.</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrm Scissors went against the tide as the scissors opened up. Like scissors cutting through red cloth, it tore a hole through the blood sword beams and slashed at Berserker Immortal like a hot knife through butter. Berserker Immortal was slightly surprised. He had already unleashed his Hell-level strength, but he was still unable to block the Golden Wyrm Scissors. All he could do was quickly duck.</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the four immortals were already in terrible shape. Parts of their ancient corpse bodies had been destroyed by Berserker Immortal’s sword beams, while other parts were crumbling after being forced to unleash immense strength way beyond the limits of the body.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>At the instant Berserker Immortal dodged the Golden Wyrm Scissors, he heard a gunshot. A bullet was aimed at his face, going straight for his head.</p>
<p>However, the bullet was shattered by the blood sword beams before it reached Berserker Immortal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen mounted the sniper rifle on a collapsed wall and shot in Berserker Immortal’s direction six times, but the six bullets were shattered by the blood sword beams. They couldn’t approach him at all.</p>
<p>Instead, the might of Berserker Immortal’s blood sword beams increased greatly, tearing apart the originally tottering Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. Blood sword beams that blotted out the sky rushed out like a sea of blood that enveloped the world.</p>
<p>The four immortals rushed out as well, but most of their ancient corpses had been destroyed, forcing them to be suppressed by the rules of Earth. Their bodies trembled as they moaned in pain. It was as though invisible chains were strangling them, making it difficult for them to move. Their throats emitted strange sounds as though they were about to stop breathing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could clearly sense that their powerful auras were rapidly weakening.</p>
<p>These fellows are from the dimension! Zhou Wen immediately understood that they weren’t Earthlings. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have suffered such severe rejection and pressure.</p>
<p>Although the four immortals suffered immense pressure, the pressure wasn’t enough to take their lives. It only constantly dropped their level in life.</p>
<p>They, who were originally at the Hell level, had fallen to the Calamity grade in just moments. Now, they only had strength at the Terror grade, and it was still dropping.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Berserker Immortal’s blood sword beams became more and more terrifying. The ancient corpse’s body cracked like a withered field, but it didn’t truly crumble.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal didn’t waste any time on the Golden Wyrm Scissors. As he dodged the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ attacks, he controlled the blood sword beams that filled the sky to sweep towards Zhou Wen from all directions.</p>
<p>The blood sword beams were just too terrifying—they were almost everywhere. They enveloped most of Guide City. The roofs of skyscrapers were the first to come into contact with the sword beam before being wrecked.</p>
<p>The buildings began to turn red from the top before exploding. The blood-like sword beams constantly pressed down as though the end of the world was approaching.</p>
<p>People screamed and cried, or they tried their best to escape, but under such terrifying power, ordinary people couldn’t escape at all. They could only wait for death to arrive.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could escape, but if he did, the hundreds of thousands of people in Guide City would be instantly killed. Even the entire city would be completely destroyed, leaving nothing behind.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held his sniper rifle and continued aiming at Berserker Immortal, ignoring the blood sword beams that filled the sky.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The seventh gunshot sounded as a bullet shot out from the chamber, piercing through the blood sword beams like a beam of light.</p>
<p>The sure-kill seventh shot was a sure-kill bullet that used all the Golden Sniper’s strength. The bullet shuttled through the blood sword beams crazily. It wasn’t shattered by them like the first six bullets.</p>
<p>This bullet needed to see blood. It charged through the blood sword beams alone, but the blood sword beams were just too powerful as they struck it, dropping its speed until it almost stopped.</p>
<p>Hum!</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrm Scissors flew over and tore through space in front of the bullet as it charged at Berserker Immortal.</p>
<p>The bullet shot at Berserker Immortal at the speed of light using the space torn by the Golden Wyrm Scissors.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal warped into the distance and dodged the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ attack. As for the sure-kill seventh bullet, it automatically made a turn and continued pursuing Berserker Immortal.</p>
<p>“The seventh bullet in the Venusian dimensional zone might be fatal to others, but to me, such strength is still too weak.” Berserker Immortal recognized the origins of the seventh bullet. He clamped the bullet between his fingers the instant the bullet reached him.</p>
<p>The bullet spun between his fingers like a drill, but it couldn’t advance even an inch.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1518'>Chapter 1518 Threat</h3>
<p>Berserker Immortal exerted strength again. The sure-kill bullet couldn’t continue spinning under his immense pressure. The bullet kept trembling, but it couldn’t move at all. It was almost flattened under the terrifying forces of his fingers.</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrm Scissors charged over again. Unwilling to fight the Golden Wyrm Scissors head-on, Berserker Immortal could only duck again.</p>
<p>As Berserker Immortal dodged, the bullet in his hand turned into an ancient mirror.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal’s reaction was already very fast. He threw out the ancient mirror in his hand, but he was too close to it. The light from the ancient mirror continued shining on him.</p>
<p>When the strange light shone on Berserker Immortal, his body and the blood-colored sword beam that filled the sky suddenly vanished, leaving nothing behind.</p>
<p>The horrified people stared blankly at the sky. If not for the fact that the buildings were halved in height, they would have imagined that the terrifying blood sea sword beams were just a dream.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his hand and beckoned for the Soul Mirror to return to his hand. He saw a sanguine glow in the mirror as though it was about to seep out.</p>
<p>Cracks began to appear on the originally smooth mirror surface, and they were rapidly spreading</p>
<p>“I’ll leave this place to you.” Zhou Wen roared at Li Xuan, Feng Qiuyan, and company before vanishing with the Soul Mirror, thanks to interstellar teleportation.</p>
<p>Li Xuan, Feng Qiuyan, and Ming Xiu understood what Zhou Wen meant and immediately charged at the four immortals.</p>
<p>The four immortals’ faces turned livid. They hadn’t accomplished anything, but their ancient corpse bodies had been destroyed by their companion, Berserker Immortal. Being severely suppressed by the rules of Earth, they could barely maintain their Terror-grade standards-one that just met the mark.</p>
<p>They originally imagined that no one could withstand Berserker Immortal’s explosive strength, but to their surprise, he vanished for no reason, leaving the four of them lamenting inwardly.</p>
<p>They had seen the strength of Li Xuan and company. If they were in the dimension, it would be too easy to kill them, but not here and now.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen teleported to Dubhe. The cracks on the Soul Mirror had spread like spiderwebs, an indication that it was about to shatter.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen picked up the Soul Mirror and aimed it at Dubhe. When the Soul-Illuminating Divine Light shone on it, Berserker Immortal and the blood sword beams that filled the sky immediately appeared again.</p>
<p>However, he was no longer in Guide City, but in the hot plasma of Dubhe. Light pulses constantly exploded around him like countless hydrogen bombs.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that Dubhe’s terrifying light pulses would affect Berserker Immortal and might even damage his body.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, the blood sword beams around him resisted the high temperature, radiation, and energy explosions. They protected his body as he rushed out of Dubhe.</p>
<p>What a terrifying fellow! Zhou Wen knew that Berserker Immortal was definitely suppressed by hellish rules. His true strength wasn’t just that.</p>
<p>To be able to produce such power under such circumstances was truly terrifying.</p>
<p>After Berserker Immortal rushed out, he didn’t attack Zhou Wen immediately because he was certain that Zhou Wen was good at spatial teleportation.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen were to teleport away, there was nothing he could do about him.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, let’s make a deal,” Berserker Immortal said as he stood amidst the blood that filled the sky and looked down at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What deal?” Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to leave as he asked calmly.</p>
<p>“You are Deceit King, right?” Although Berserker Immortal was asking, his tone was certain.</p>
<p>“Does it matter?” Zhou Wen knew that the spatial ability he had exposed had made Berserker Immortal connect him to Deceit</p>
<p>King.</p>
<p>“Yes, it really doesn’t matter. Your spatial powers are very strong. Even in the dimension, there aren’t many people at your level who are stronger than you.” Berserker Immortal paused before continuing, “I really can’t kill you here, but even if you can escape, your family can’t. Your friends and the hundreds of thousands of people in Guide City won’t be able to escape either.”</p>
<p>“Are you threatening me?” Zhou Wen looked coldly at Berserker Immortal.</p>
<p>“I’m just stating a fact. Don’t you think so?” Berserker Immortal asked.</p>
<p>“What are you getting at?” Zhou Wen was already filled with killing intent.</p>
<p>He was a person who seldom had the intention to kill. Even when facing an opponent who wanted him dead, Zhou Wen could calmly do what he needed to do.</p>
<p>This was because he knew very well that the other party was his enemy. Wanting him dead was very normal. There was no need to be enraged about it.</p>
<p>However, Berserker Immortal was different. His actions were no longer as simple as an enemy.</p>
<p>“Cooperate with me. From now on, you will be my race’s representative in the human world,” said Berserker Immortal.</p>
<p>“Which race are you from?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“If you are willing to cooperate, you will naturally know in the future.” Berserker Immortal didn’t answer Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“And what if I don’t?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“No one related to you will live,” said Berserker Immortal coldly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly laughed happily. Berserker Immortal stared coldly at Zhou Wen and said, “What’s so funny? If you weren’t proficient in spatial powers, killing you wouldn’t have been difficult. Although I can’t kill you now, your family and friends don’t have spatial powers like yours. Killing them is too easy. It wouldn’t take much more effort than squashing an ant.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stopped laughing and looked at Berserker Immortal with a blade-like gaze. “You’re right. It’s indeed very simple for you to kill them.”</p>
<p>“Now that you are clear on that, what’s your choice? Do you want them to die or do you want to cooperate with me?” Berserker Immortal asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I don’t want them dead, nor do I want to cooperate with you,” Zhou Wen said calmly.</p>
<p>“You have no other choice. You can only choose one,” said Berserker Immortal coldly.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen shook his head and said, “I naturally have other paths to take.” “Oh, what path is it?” Berserker Immortal asked.</p>
<p>“As long as I kill you, all the problems will be resolved. That is the third path.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors again.</p>
<p>However, this time, Zhou Wen held the Golden Wyrm Scissors in his hand instead of letting it attack autonomously.</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrm Scissors was very powerful and was at the Hell level. Zhou Wen’s strength was far inferior to the Golden Wyrm Scissors, but the strength of the Golden Wyrm Scissors wasn’t enough to kill Berserker Immortal either.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1519'>Chapter 1519 Sword Dao Competition</h3>
<p>Berserker Immortal was as cold as before. He wasn’t angered by Zhou Wen’s words. Zhou Wen’s actions were in line with his thoughts.</p>
<p>His Calamity Zone had an extremely powerful offensive power, but it didn’t stop Zhou Wen from using spatial teleportation. What he was most afraid of was Zhou Wen escaping.</p>
<p>Now that Zhou Wen planned on fighting to the death and not escaping, it was naturally in line with Berserker Immortal’s intentions.</p>
<p>“If you want to kill me, come on. Give it your best shot.” Berserker Immortal extended his hand and the blood sword beams that filled the sky gathered towards his palm.</p>
<p>Thousands of blood sword beams gathered together, forming a Sword of Blood that Berserker Immortal held in his hand.</p>
<p>Although killing Zhou Wen was easier using the blood sea-like sword beams, Berserker Immortal’s goal wasn’t to kill Zhou Wen, but to make him submit.</p>
<p>The ancient corpse’s body couldn’t withstand Berserker Immortal’s descent for long. Now that it had suffered such serious injuries, Berserker Immortal didn’t have much time left. He had to choose the new representative of the Immortals in the human world before returning</p>
<p>It was probably too late to find others. Furthermore, Berserker Immortal didn’t believe that anyone was more suitable than Zhou Wen to be the new representative.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the Golden Wyrm Scissors and got the Golden Wyrm Scissors to fuse together as a broadsword without any sharpened edges.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed the sword as it became one with the Golden Wyrm Scissors and transformed into a stream of light that stabbed at Berserker Immortal.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Zhou Wen didn’t wish to lead while the sword followed; the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ strength was far stronger than his. If he made the Golden Wyrm Scissors follow according to his strength, it would only weaken the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ might.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen chose to use his strength to support the Golden Wyrm Scissors. He was the support, and the sword was the main offensive force.</p>
<p>If an ordinary person were to use such a sword art, they would inevitably fall into a disadvantageous position. This was because the person practicing the sword was human. Humans were the main offensive force, and the sword was auxiliary. If the sword was the main force while the human was controlled by the sword, it was equivalent to an unorthodox path-it was very easy for something negative to happen.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal moved slightly and dodged the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ attack. He slashed at Zhou Wen’s head with the Sword of Blood and said, “Your abilities aren’t bad, but your temperament is lacking. The Sword Dao is the heart. Your heart is controlled by the sword. How can a heartless person become a true expert?”</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal clearly believed that Zhou Wen’s method of using the sword was too clumsy and wasn’t a top-notch Sword Dao.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored Berserker Immortal as he struck out again and again.</p>
<p>Even though Berserker Immortal had condensed the Sword of Blood, he didn’t dare clash head-on with the Golden Wyrm Scissors. All he did was constantly dodge, hoping to defeat Zhou Wen with his sword techniques.</p>
<p>However, over time, Berserker Immortal was surprised to discover that he couldn’t suppress Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrm Scissors was very powerful, but Zhou Wen’s strength hadn’t reached that level. However, under Zhou Wen’s usage, the might emitted by the Golden Wyrm Scissors was much stronger than when the Golden Wyrm Scissors fought alone.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal was surprised to discover that although Zhou Wen seemed to be using himself as a support, he could use very tiny amounts of strength to influence the Golden Wyrm Scissors.</p>
<p>It looked like the Golden Wyrm Scissors was in charge, but in fact, Zhou Wen was the one controlling everything.</p>
<p>A human can actually cultivate his Sword Dao to such a level? Berserker Immortal was known as a sword immortal; therefore, his attainments in the Sword Dao were naturally extremely high. He had realized what was happening.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s sword art today surprised him. He couldn’t gain the upper hand in a clash of sword techniques.</p>
<p>“What sword art is this?” Berserker Immortal asked as he fought Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“A sword art doesn’t necessarily need a name.” Zhou Wen’s Heart Defying Sword Art was born from the three thousand sword intents. He could use the style of any sword technique freely.</p>
<p>However, the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ situation was somewhat special. It wasn’t a real sword, so Zhou Wen had to use a special method to control it. It was very different from the sword techniques Zhou Wen usually used.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal originally wanted to quickly defeat Zhou Wen, but after seeing Zhou Wen’s sword art, he had the urge to watch further. He didn’t immediately fight Zhou Wen with all his might.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal was famous for being a sword immortal. He was a fanatic of the way of the sword. When he saw an excellent sword art he didn’t know, he couldn’t help but take a second gander.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already pushed the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ strength to its limits. His body cooperated with the Golden Wyrm Scissors as he constantly instant transmitted and attacked, but all his attacks were dodged by Berserker Immortal.</p>
<p>The Sword of Blood in Berserker Immortal’s hand similarly failed to injure Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Moments later, Berserker Immortal suddenly said, “Your sword technique isn’t bad, but unfortunately, you haven’t truly mastered it. Today, I’ll let you see what a true sword technique is.”</p>
<p>With that said, Berserker Immortal’s hand moved as he stabbed at Zhou Wen’s heart. He was so fast that Zhou Wen couldn’t see him clearly.</p>
<p>Before Berserker Immortal’s Sword of Blood reached his chest, Zhou Wen felt as though his heart had already been pierced.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen brandished the Golden Wyrm Scissors to block, but just as the Golden Wyrm Scissors moved, the Sword of Blood changed its position and stabbed at Zhou Wen’s glabella.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal fought Zhou Wen purely with his sword techniques. After more than ten strikes, Zhou Wen was forced to retreat without any room to counterattack.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal’s sword art could no longer be described as domineering. When it came to being domineering, there would be traces of it-domineering when needed and restrained when unneeded.</p>
<p>However, Berserker Immortal’s sword art was now completely different. He was domineering when it should be domineering, and still domineering when it shouldn’t be. He was practically suicidal.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal’s every strike was aimed at the enemy’s vital spots, forcing his opponent to defend or retreat with no chance of counterattacking.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen actually knew such a sword art that attacked the enemy’s vital spots, but he quickly realized that the two were completely different. When he used such a method to deal with Berserker Immortal, he nearly lost his cadence several times.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal didn’t dodge when facing his opponent, but he wasn’t without flaws. It could even be said that he had many flaws. Furthermore, he didn’t take these flaws seriously at all. All he cared about was killing his enemy. He didn’t care about the flaws in his sword art as he constantly attacked.</p>
<p>It didn’t deserve being called a sword art. It was better to call it a gamble of life.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen finally understood what it meant to be fearless. Berserker Immortal’s sword art was the fearless kind.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was forced to retreat under Berserker Immortal’s attacks despite wielding a divine weapon like the Golden Wyrm Scissors. He couldn’t gain an advantage in a pure clash of swords.</p>
<p>It had been a long time since Zhou Wen had been at a disadvantage in battle. His Heart Defying Sword Art was seldom suppressed by others, so he never expected there to be another sword art that wasn’t included in the three thousand sword intents.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1520'>Chapter 1520 Let’s Do It Here</h3>
<p>The feeling Berserker Immortal gave Zhou Wen was like an upgraded version of Zhong Ziya. He was equally crazy and domineering. Although the sword arts were different, the feeling they exuded when using swords was very similar.</p>
<p>Their usage of swords was different from ordinary people’s. If one drew the analogy of using swords to driving, the first reaction of ordinary people when they saw a situation ahead would be to slow down; however, they would choose to accelerate and rush over before the route was sealed.</p>
<p>If one’s judgment was accurate and fast enough, they could pass through. However, if one made a mistake or if one’s speed wasn’t fast enough, they would die.</p>
<p>However, Berserker Immortal was an extremely experienced veteran. In a harrowing battle, he could rush over before Zhou Wen could seal off the area. This threw Zhou Wen into an extreme disadvantage.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Zhou Wen’s speed wasn’t as fast as Berserker Immortal’s. On the other hand, the Golden Wyrm Scissors wasn’t a real sword to begin with. Its body was a little too big, so it wasn’t suitable during a speed competition.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen’s instant transmission was already very powerful with the augmentation of The Disqualified. Coupled with his movement technique and The Disqualified’s ability to automatically sense the enemy’s weakness, it wasn’t easy for Berserker Immortal to defeat Zhou Wen with his sword art.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal was equally surprised. As the dignified Berserker Immortal, a Heaven-level sword expert who had once defeated an Apocalypse-grade existence, he still found it difficult to truly suppress Zhou Wen despite his advantage in Strength and Speed. Zhou Wen’s Sword Dao and combat strength far exceeded his expectations.</p>
<p>A Terror-grade human can actually cultivate a Sword Dao to such a level. How many humans like him are there on Earth? Berserker Immortal was somewhat worried.</p>
<p>In the past, humans were limited by their inherent flaws. After so many years, their growth remained highly restricted. Now, not long after they broke through the restrictions, many experts like Human Sovereign, Wang Mingyuan, and Zhou Wen had already appeared.</p>
<p>If humans were allowed to continue growing like this, even if the boundary between Earth and the dimension was broken one day, and the dimensional creatures would no longer be suppressed by the cosmic rules of Earth, it would still be a question if they could suppress humanity.</p>
<p>I have to establish a human faction on Earth that can control everything as soon as possible. I need to control humanity. The Sword of Blood in Berserker Immortal’s hand became more and more violent.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could clearly see the sword stab over, but when he used the Golden Wyrm Scissors to block, it would slow down every time, preventing him from touching Berserker Immortal’s sword.</p>
<p>Even the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation around him couldn’t completely block the Sword of Blood. More and more wounds appeared on Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you want to kill me? Come on? How can you kill me if you keep retreating? Attack!” Berserker Immortal mocked as he attacked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as he continued fighting Berserker Immortal. Although his injuries increased, he didn’t use any other Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Using a Companion Beast could indeed give Zhou Wen a breather, but it couldn’t help him clinch victory. If he only wanted to survive, Zhou Wen could teleport away immediately, but this wasn’t what he wanted.</p>
<p>The Disqualified needed a large amount of information to carry out its inference. Every time Zhou Wen was injured, the Disqualified would gain a deeper understanding of Berserker Immortal, allowing him to deduce more weaknesses.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Zhou Wen didn’t know Berserker Immortal’s weakness, but Berserker Immortal had cultivated a sword art to its limits. He used one advantage to mask all his weaknesses.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen knew that Berserker Immortal had many weaknesses, he couldn’t even protect himself under such an onslaught. He had no chance of exploiting those weaknesses.</p>
<p>Even if he’s really an immortal and really doesn’t make mistakes, it’s impossible for him to use one advantage to deal with all the problems. Zhou Wen knew that all he needed to do was continue enduring. As long as The Disqualified obtained enough information, it would definitely be able to analyze his opponent’s weakness.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal had the constant belief of suppressing Zhou Wen and making him suffer a mental breakdown. However, despite his injuries increasing, Zhou Wen didn’t show any signs of panic.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it’s impossible to make him yield just by injuring him. Then, I can only let him sample the taste of death. When Berserker Immortal saw that Zhou Wen had no intention of surrendering, he brandished the Sword of Blood in his hand again. It transformed into sword beams that filled the sky as they attacked from all directions.</p>
<p>The terrifying sword beam instantly dyed the nearby void red. The area within Zhou Wen’s instant transmission range was filled with sword beams. Apart from blocking, there was no other way.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen used instant transmission again. However, this time, he instant transmitted in the direction of Dubhe.</p>
<p>The Dubhe was massive, far bigger than Earth. The last time Zhou Wen searched Dubhe, he could only use interstellar teleportation to head to different locations around Dubhe. After a general search, he couldn’t even figure out where the dimensional zone was on Dubhe.</p>
<p>However, after seeing the scene of the Tyrannosaurus clearing the level, Zhou Wen knew that as long as he didn’t open the door to the palace, there shouldn’t be much danger. He would be fine even if he encountered Dubhe’s dimensional zone.</p>
<p>The moment he instant transmitted into Dubhe, Zhou Wen felt the terrifyingly high temperature, radiation, and shockwaves. All sorts of energy erupted. Even his body had trouble withstanding them. He was still on Dubhe’s surface and had yet to venture too deep.</p>
<p>The Ancient Sovereign Sutra erupted without any reservations as Human Sovereign Sacrifices to the Heavens was activated. Although this domain didn’t heal Zhou Wen, it could greatly enhance his physique, making him comparable to a Human Realm creature.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Berserker Immortal charged in with the sword beams that resembled a river of blood. The flames outside Dubhe were washed away by the sword beams as high-temperature liquid splattered everywhere.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that the Ancient Sovereign Sutra was augmented to a certain extent in such a high-temperature environment. After the Human Sovereign Life Soul in his body was augmented, the light intensified and his vitality became stronger.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t summon the Human Sovereign Life Soul, nor did he fuse with it. In that case, anyone could easily tell that he was Human Sovereign.</p>
<p>Even without summoning it, the augmentation of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra had already strengthened Zhou Wen’s vitality His physique had clearly become stronger.</p>
<p>Instead, Berserker Immortal was clearly affected by Dubhe’s high temperature. Although the effects weren’t too great, the time the sword beams tore through the high-temperature liquid gave Zhou Wen a chance.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned around and continued charging into Dubhe. The high temperature of Dubhe not only augmented his Ancient Sovereign Sutra, but it also tempered the Golden Wyrm Scissors, making it stronger.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal pursued relentlessly as his sword beams tore through the high-temperature liquid and constantly struck Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen brandished the resplendent Golden Wyrm Scissors and shattered the blood sword beams that surged behind him. None of the sword beams came close to him.</p>
<p>Before long, the blood sword beams formed a circle again, trapping Zhou Wen in the sword beams that filled the sky.</p>
<p>“Let’s do it here,” Zhou Wen suddenly stopped and said to Berserker Immortal.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1521'>Chapter 1521 Berserker Technique</h3>
<p>“Why? Have you thought it through?” Berserker Immortal stood in the sea of blood sword beams and said to Zhou Wen who was also surrounded by them.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve figured it out.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>“What have you figured out? Do you want to fight to the bitter end and wait for your family and friends to go to hell together, or do you want to cooperate with me?” Berserker Immortal asked.</p>
<p>“That isn’t what I figured, but how to kill you.” Zhou Wen gripped the Golden Wyrm Scissors in his hand tightly as all his Essence Energy crazily condensed into it.</p>
<p>“You said something similar previously. It doesn’t seem to be effective,” Berserker Immortal said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Perhaps the effects will be better now.” Zhou Wen didn’t mind Berserker Immortal’s mockery as he continued injecting his Essence Energy into the Golden Wyrm Scissors.</p>
<p>“Some things shouldn’t be randomly experimented on. If you want to try, you have to be prepared to die. I won’t give you a chance to live.” Berserker Immortal was already filled with killing intent.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s strength had exceeded Berserker Immortal’s expectations. He found it difficult to truly control him. Even if he barely subdued him, he might be the next Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>Therefore, if Zhou Wen still didn’t yield, Berserker Immortal planned on killing him. Then, he would choose Li Xuan, Ming Xiu, and Feng Qiuyan as the new representatives of the Immortals in the human world.</p>
<p>“Death is nothing to humans. Ever since humans were born, they knew that they would die. Humans cherish their lives more because life is short, but that doesn’t mean they are afraid of death. As for you, you are different. You have never imagined dying, right? That’s why you should be mentally prepared to die,” Zhou Wen said calmly.</p>
<p>“Humph!” Berserker Immortal snorted coldly as he retracted his finger. Thousands of sword beams slashed at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Is</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal had already made up his mind. If this strike couldn’t kill Zhou Wen, he would turn around and return to Earth’s Guide City before bringing Ming Xiu and company under control.</p>
<p>To Berserker Immortal’s surprise, Zhou Wen didn’t choose to continue using spatial skills to escape.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored the blood sword beams that surged over from all directions like a tidal wave. He raised the Golden Wyrm Scissors in his hand and fused with it as he stabbed at Berserker Immortal.</p>
<p>A golden beam tore through the tidal-like blood sword beam and instantly appeared in front of Berserker Immortal.</p>
<p>“You are still too naive. That strange Companion Beast weapon can withstand my sword beams, but your body can’t… Enclose…” Berserker Immortal retreated as he spoke softly and clenched his fingers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and the Golden Wyrm Scissors, who were surrounded by the blood sword beams, were immediately enveloped by them.</p>
<p>The sword beams that were as tiny as neutrinos were everywhere as they struck Zhou Wen and the Golden Wyrm Scissors. The Golden Wyrm Scissors was extremely strong, so the sword beams couldn’t injure it. It could still tear through the sword beams ahead of it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t have such a strong physique. The infinite sword beams tore through the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation and when they touched his body, they immediately stabbed in. In an instant, Zhou Wen’s armor and flesh were dyed blood-red by the sword beams.</p>
<p>It was the phenomenon of the sword beams entering his body. Following that, Zhou Wen’s body would shatter into dust.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen seemed to be at the end of his rope against the endless blood sword beams.</p>
<p>Although Berserker Immortal didn’t let down his guard, he couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief. It was best not to keep a human like Zhou Wen around. Zhou Wen choosing to fight him to the death suited his intentions.</p>
<p>Although things didn’t work out the way I expected, it’s best if this human dies. Berserker Immortal watched as the countless blood sword beams stabbed into Zhou Wen’s body. Zhou Wen’s death seemed to be a foregone conclusion, but for some reason, he still felt uneasy.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal was very confident in his sword beams. Even a Calamity-grade creature would definitely be doomed if so many sword beams entered their bodies, much less a Terror-grade creature.</p>
<p>However, he was still somewhat uneasy. Berserker Immortal didn’t believe that Zhou Wen would be so foolish as to let him kill him in such a manner based on Zhou Wen’s previous actions.</p>
<p>However, Berserker Immortal couldn’t figure out how Zhou Wen could reverse such a hopeless situation.</p>
<p>Just as Berserker Immortal was pondering over it, he suddenly realized that Zhou Wen’s body had undergone a strange change.</p>
<p>The armor on Zhou Wen’s body had already exploded. His already red body should have exploded with the armor, but it didn’t.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body instantly turned into a blinding white liquid. It was the same liquid that was everywhere on Dubhe. The liquid exploded as energy and sword beams scattered everywhere like a blood sun.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Wen and the Golden Wyrm Scissors, they appeared in the area behind Berserker Immortal. Then, they used instant transmission to appear right behind him. The Golden Wyrm Scissors tore through the sword beams and slashed at Berserker Immortal’s head again.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal immediately reacted as he moved at high speeds. Infinite sword beams enveloped Zhou Wen again.</p>
<p>However, this time, the sword beams remained useless. When the sword beams invaded Zhou Wen’s body, his body turned into a blob of liquid.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had used Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping to an extremely ingenious level. He charged all the way and left a large number of spatial marks in Dubhe’s liquid. Every time the sword beams entered his body, he would swap with a blob of liquid and have the intrusive sword beams be trapped inside the liquid. His true body would arrive at a safe spot.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen constantly switched positions and constantly instant transmitted. Like a ghost, he attacked Berserker Immortal crazily.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal was surprised to discover that Zhou Wen’s attack technique was 90% similar to his Berserker Technique.</p>
<p>“You must be dreaming if you think you can defeat me using my sword technique.” Seeing that his sword beams had lost their effect, Berserker Immortal extended his hand and beckoned. Thousands of sword beams condensed into the Sword of Blood again.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>However, when Berserker Immortal swung his sword and stabbed at Zhou Wen again, the Golden Wyrm Scissors blocked his Sword of Blood and sliced off a portion of it.</p>
<p>“How is this possible!” Berserker Immortal was shocked.</p>
<p>His Berserker technique should have been one step ahead of Zhou Wen’s Golden Wyrm Scissors, but Zhou Wen had actually blocked his sword. This left Berserker Immortal in disbelief.</p>
<p>The broken Blood Sword transformed into thousands of sword beams before fusing into one again. Berserker Immortal struck again and again.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal’s every strike was blocked by Zhou Wen’s Golden Wyrm Scissors. Every time the Sword of Blood was sliced off, Zhou Wen pressed forward step by step as Berserker Immortal retreated.</p>
<p>Impossible! How is this possible! He has already seen through my Berserker technique in such a short period of time? This is definitely impossible! Berserker Immortal was extremely shocked.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that there weren’t any experts in the dimension who could fight him or even crack the Berserker technique, but they were all existences at the same or higher level than him. Furthermore, they often needed to study the Berserker technique for an extended period before cracking it.</p>
<p>A human-a Terror-grade human-had actually cracked his Berserker technique in a short battle. This was even more magical than myths.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1522'>Chapter 1522 Unexpected</h3>
<p>No matter how much Berserker Immortal refused to believe it, all his attacks were blocked by Zhou Wen. Berserker Immortal kept speeding up his sword, but they were still intercepted by Zhou Wen every time.</p>
<p>It was as though a car was repeatedly overtaking another only to end with a collision. The Sword of Blood scattered in all directions. Although it would ultimately return to Berserker Immortal, the situation had already made a 180-degree turn.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the absolute initiative as he struck again and again, forcing Berserker Immortal to retreat.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal had already changed his sword art, hoping to suppress Zhou Wen again, but no matter how his sword art changed, it was impossible to take back the advantage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen seemed to see through everything. No matter how his sword art changed, Zhou Wen could strike at his most uncomfortable spot and attack his weakness. It made him so uncomfortable that he nearly vomited blood.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal found it unacceptable that his sword art had been defeated by a human. This was even more intolerable than Wang Mingyuan slapping him twice. After the previous battle, The Disqualified had completely deduced all the weaknesses of Berserker Immortal. Zhou Wen now knew Berserker Immortal’s weaknesses better than Berserker Immortal himself.</p>
<p>“I want you dead!” Berserker Immortal’s strength erupted crazily, exceeding the limits of the ancient corpse’s body. The ancient corpse’s body constantly cracked as withered flesh fell from its body. It was about to collapse.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal seemed to have gone mad as he brandished the Sword of Blood and slashed at Zhou Wen crazily. He no longer cared if he would be injured by the Golden Wyrm Scissors. He wanted to split Zhou Wen’s body before the Golden Wyrm Scissors could snap him.</p>
<p>The two of them were vying for that initiative. No one was willing to retreat at this moment.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrm Scissors in Zhou Wen’s hand suddenly spread open as the scissors that were originally stabbing at Berserker Immortal split into two. The top part blocked the Sword of Blood that was slashing at Zhou Wen and instantly snapped it. The bottom part continued stabbing at Berserker Immortal without stopping, piercing through his chest.</p>
<p>Not only did the heavily injured Berserker Immortal not show any signs of panic, but his lips even suffused a ferocious smile.</p>
<p>“Berserker Devouring the Heavens. The Door of Immortality seals one’s life. You underestimate me too much. Enjoy your last moments.” A chain-like sword beam spewed out from Berserker Immortal’s wound, instantly wrapping around the Golden Wyrm Scissors and Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>The sword aura in Berserker Immortal’s ancient corpse expanded like a balloon that was about to explode. Furthermore, it burgeoned constantly.</p>
<p>W</p>
<p>Zhou Wen struggled a few times, but he failed to escape. He felt as though his body was chained by the sword beam. He couldn’t even escape the restrictions with teleportation.</p>
<p>Even a powerful Companion Beast like the Golden Wyrm Scissors was firmly bound and unable to escape.</p>
<p>“Human, this is your destiny. You chose the wrong enemy. The power of this body’s self-destruction will consign you to eternal damnation. As for me, I will leave this body and return to the dimension unharmed. The next time I return, I will turn all your family and friends into servants or send them to hell to accompany you…” Berserker Immortal’s eyes were ferocious and smug, like a wolf that had caught its prey.</p>
<p>However, before Berserker Immortal could finish his words, he suddenly frowned slightly. He looked down and saw that Zhou Wen had stabbed a sword into his body with his other hand.</p>
<p>“It’s useless. Your attack will only make this body explode faster. No matter how injured this body is, it won’t affect me…” As Berserker Immortal spoke, his expression suddenly turned nasty.</p>
<p>He realized that the immortal body attached to the ancient corpse was suffering damage. The source of the damage was the sword in Zhou Wen’s left hand.</p>
<p>“This is… the Immortal Culling Sword… You are Human Sovereign…” Only then did Berserker Immortal seriously size up the sword. He was alarmed by what he saw.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t answer. The Immortal Culling Sword in his hand erupted with power as it sliced up from the ancient corpse’s abdomen, tearing open its entire chest along with the sword beam chains.</p>
<p>The Immortal Culling Sword’s ability to restrain Immortals was just too powerful. The Immortal Culling Sword easily severed the Immortal Gate Life Lock that could seal the Golden Wyrm Scissors. It was not much different from slicing through tofu.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that the wound delivered by Immortal Culling Sword didn’t only affect the ancient corpse. Berserker Immortal, who was attached to the ancient corpse, was also injured. Furthermore, the injuries were rapidly spreading</p>
<p>Even someone as powerful as Berserker Immortal couldn’t stop the injury inflicted by the Immortal Culling Sword from spreading.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen severed the Immortal Gate Life Lock, he slashed at Berserker Immortal with the Immortal Culling Sword in his hand again and again. At the instant the ancient corpse exploded, he instant transmitted into the distance.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The ancient corpse exploded, triggering a large-scale energy explosion on Dubhe. Terrifying energy blasts and radiation made the nearby cosmos seem to burn.</p>
<p>A red sword beam rushed out of the explosions on Dubhe.</p>
<p>The sword beam hadn’t gone far before it was intercepted by Zhou Wen who had instant transmitted over.</p>
<p>The red glow was none other than Berserker Immortal who had escaped the ancient corpse’s body. At that moment, his body seemed to be bound by invisible chains. The chains tightened as the sword beams on the red glow weakened.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there were sword marks on the humanoid body condensed from the red glow. The sword marks constantly extended as they tore through Berserker Immortal’s body.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal unleashed a barrage of sword beams in a bid to break through Zhou Wen’s obstruction. Unfortunately, his Heaven-level strength was almost unable to reach the Hell level under the suppression of Earth’s cosmic rules.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrm Scissors flashed as one of Berserker Immortal’s arms was sliced off, making his already terrible situation even direr.</p>
<p>“If it wasn’t for this darn place, you would have died ten thousand times over. How could you injure me?” Berserker Immortal knew that it would be difficult for him to escape today, so he stopped fleeing and gathered his remaining strength to fight Zhou Wen to the death.</p>
<p>“Then why did you come?” Zhou Wen said indifferently as he mercilessly slashed with the Immortal Culling Sword in his hand.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal was slightly taken aback. He had never expected such a situation when he came.</p>
<p>If he had known that Zhou Wen was so ferocious, he wouldn’t have given him a chance. If he had known that Zhou Wen was Human Sovereign and possessed the Immortal Culling Sword, he wouldn’t have used the Immortal Gate Life Lock that gave Zhou Wen a chance to approach him.</p>
<p>It was too late. There were no what-ifs.</p>
<p>At this point, Berserker Immortal was somewhat relieved. He looked at Zhou Wen and said, “I never expected Zhou Wen, Deceit King, and Human Sovereign to be the same person. You’re very good. My loss wasn’t in vain, but don’t think that you won just like that. If you want my life, you have to pay the price.”</p>
<p>With that said, without waiting for Zhou Wen to react, Berserker Immortal’s red body suddenly transformed into thousands of sword beams. They bloomed in space like blood-red flowers.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1523'>Chapter 1523 Unknown Land</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen charged at Berserker Immortal, hoping to completely kill him to prevent any future trouble.</p>
<p>The change caught him by surprise as the myriad sword beams appeared too quickly. Unable to use instant transmission, he could only brandish his sword to meet the sword beams.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the sword beams spewed out in all directions, instead of being concentrated at Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen brandished the Immortal Culling Sword and the Golden Wyrm Scissors, hoping to shatter the sword beams ahead of him.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, the sword beams were like phantoms. Be it the Immortal Culling Sword or the Golden Wyrm Scissors, they failed to touch the sword beams.</p>
<p>The sword beams even passed through Zhou Wen’s body, forming a blood-red chrysanthemum that bloomed before instantly disappearing. Zhou Wen immediately checked his body and didn’t discover any remnant imprints. He secretly heaved a sigh of relief. At the same time, he was puzzled as to what use the skill that Berserker Immortal had sacrificed himself for was.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen looked around, he couldn’t help but be taken aback.</p>
<p>This wasn’t Dubhe at all. It was no longer scorching hot. Wherever he looked, there was an endless sea of beautiful flowers.</p>
<p>What is this place? Zhou Wen frowned as he looked around. He felt that this was Earth. The composition of the air was very similar to Earth.</p>
<p>However, after trying Singularity Universe, he realized that he couldn’t determine his location, nor could he teleport out.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal sacrificed himself to teleport me here. It’s definitely not a good place. Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to scan his surroundings, but other than the sea of flowers, there was nothing here.</p>
<p>What was even stranger was that there were only flowers here. Furthermore, there were no animals, no bees, no butterflies, not even a single insect, much less animals.</p>
<p>The flowers looked very ordinary and didn’t seem to be anything special. They weren’t dimensional plants.</p>
<p>What is this place? Zhou Wen couldn’t figure it out. All he could do was converge his aura, put on the Invisibility Cloak, and fly in a certain direction, hoping to discover some useful information.</p>
<p>As he didn’t know where he was, Zhou Wen didn’t dare fly too quickly. He slowly flew forward. The endless sea of flowers remained after flying for about fifty kilometers. However, a creature finally appeared in the sea of flowers.</p>
<p>That’s… the Devil? Zhou Wen looked at the creature sitting cross-legged in the sea of flowers and his heart sank.</p>
<p>The creature was covered in red skin and had horns on its head. On its back was a pair of bat-like wings. Its face was like an ox and it looked ugly and strange. It was very similar to the legendary Devil in the West District.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of the devil, but he thought of a serious problem.</p>
<p>If that was really a devil and this wasn’t Earth, could it be the dimension?</p>
<p>Don’t tell me that fellow teleported me to the dimension’s Devils? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>He had been to the dimension once. The spatial rules there were completely different from Earth’s universe. Mythical creatures found it difficult to move there.</p>
<p>Now that Zhou Wen was already at the Terror grade and could even match a Calamity-grade creature, there was definitely no problem with movement. However, it wasn’t to the point of not feeling anything.</p>
<p>The environment here didn’t seem like the dimension. Instead, it was very close to Earth’s.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was pondering over it, the devil creature sitting cross-legged in the sea of flowers opened its eyes. Its black eyes immediately lit up as it stood up. It was more than four meters tall. To humans, it was considered a giant.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed. The devil-like creature flapped the wings on its back, causing the flowers around it to splatter everywhere. The devil’s figure vanished from Zhou Wen’s sight.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The devil creature appeared above Zhou Wen and slashed at his head with its claw. Zhou Wen used the Golden Wyrm Scissors to block its claw.</p>
<p>It was so fast that Zhou Wen didn’t even have the time to open the Golden Wyrm Scissors. All he did was use the scissors to block the claw.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a huge force coming from the Golden Wyrm Scissors. Unable to hold onto the Golden Wyrm Scissors, it was snatched away by the devil.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly ordered the Golden Wyrm Scissors to fly back.</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrm Scissors trembled incessantly in the devil’s claws, but it failed to escape its claws and fly back.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was flabbergasted. The Golden Wyrm Scissors was a Hell-level Companion Beast, but it was actually immobilized. How powerful was that?</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal has indeed teleported me to a terrifying place! Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and turned around to instant transmit. He didn’t even want the Golden Wyrm Scissors.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Zhou Wen didn’t want it, but if the devil could even control the Golden Wyrm Scissors, then Zhou Wen was on a completely different level from it. He would probably die if he went over to snatch the Golden Wyrm Scissors from it.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen phased into existence, he saw a red light flash in front of him. The devil had already arrived in front of him. One of its claws grabbed the Golden Wyrm Scissors as its other claw swiped at Zhou Wen’s head.</p>
<p>The blade-like nails looked like they might pierce through Zhou Wen’s head and body if they really hit him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the Prisoned Dragon armor and donned it. He also pulled out the Immortal Culling Sword and stabbed at the devil’s claw.</p>
<p>Chi!</p>
<p>The Immortal Culling Sword pierced through the devil’s claw. Although the devil didn’t cry out in pain, it subconsciously retracted its claw. Zhou Wen took the opportunity to instant transmit elsewhere.</p>
<p>However, just like the last time, just as Zhou Wen phased into existence, he saw a red shadow flash. The devil had caught up to him again, and its injured claws had already healed. It grabbed at Zhou Wen’s head again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen now understood why Berserker Immortal hadn’t sent him to the dimension’s Immortals but to such a godforsaken place.</p>
<p>The Immortal Culling Sword had a very strong restraining effect on Immortals. If Immortals were injured by the Immortal Culling Sword, it would be very difficult for their wounds to heal. It was even possible for the wound to constantly spread.</p>
<p>However, against the devil, the Immortal Culling Sword’s effects weren’t that obvious. At the very least, it didn’t have any restraining effects.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was extremely depressed. This devil wasn’t stronger than Berserker Immortal, who had been suppressed by Earth’s rules. However, Zhou Wen had had his most powerful weapon, the Golden Wyrm Scissors, snatched away from him. Previously, when he fought Berserker Immortal, the Soul Mirror had suffered serious damage. Now, it was still self-repairing and couldn’t be used for the time being.</p>
<p>He failed to gain the upper hand even with the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to summon the Golden Sniper and have him shoot from afar to aid him in his battle with the devil.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought that as long as the Golden Sniper fired the seventh bullet, he could cause a certain level of restraining effect on the devil. He might even severely injure it.</p>
<p>To his surprise, just as the Golden Sniper fired the second bullet, the devil strangely appeared behind him and swatted the Golden Sniper who was hiding in the flowers, sending him and the sniper rifle flying.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen hadn’t reacted fast enough and unsummoned the Golden Sniper, the Golden Sniper would probably have died if the devil dealt another blow.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1524'>Chapter 1524 Colorful Devil</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen could only constantly move and use instant transmission to dodge the devil’s attacks.</p>
<p>The devil held the Golden Wyrm Scissors in one hand, making it difficult for it to escape. However, its combat strength was still terrifying. It was undoubtedly a Hell-level creature.</p>
<p>The sea of flowers was boundless. Just as Zhou Wen was instant transmitting, he suddenly realized that another devil had appeared in front of him.</p>
<p>The devil in front of him looked almost identical to the red devil that was pursuing Zhou Wen. It was also sitting cross-legged in the sea of flowers. The only difference was that the devil’s skin was blue.</p>
<p>When the blue devil sensed the commotion, it opened its eyes and looked in Zhou Wen’s direction. Suddenly, it flapped its wings and flew into the air, transforming into a blue shadow that appeared in front of Zhou Wen and grabbed at his head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen already had a plan. At the instant the blue devil’s claw was about to touch his head, his figure vanished and he instant transmitted in another direction.</p>
<p>Seeing the blue devil almost collide with the red devil behind him, Zhou Wen looked forward to seeing them fight.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, the red and blue devils stopped their attacks and charged at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, isn’t it said that devils are most territorial? Why didn’t these two different-looking devils fight? Zhou Wen was depressed, but he could only continue fleeing.</p>
<p>It was already very difficult to fight a single devil. Now that he was being pursued by two devils, Zhou Wen’s situation became even more difficult. All he could do was summon the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>As he used the Chaos Egg to block the devils’ attacks, he used instant transmission to escape.</p>
<p>What kind of crappy place is this? Apart from the sea of flowers, can’t there be anything else? Zhou Wen didn’t know how far he had fled. He estimated it to be more than ten thousand kilometers. Apart from the sea of flowers, he didn’t see anything.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally hoped to leave the sea of flowers and have a place like a mountain range that could provide him with concealment. Perhaps, he could find a place to hide. To his surprise, this godforsaken place was an endless plain. There weren’t any undulations, much less a mountain range.</p>
<p>This definitely isn’t the Devil realm. Why are there so many flowers in the Devil realm? It should be a hellish scene. Just as Zhou Wen was feeling depressed, he was alarmed to discover another devil in front of him.</p>
<p>This devil had purple skin. Its appearance was similar to the other two devils. It also charged over.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen cursed inwardly, Did Berserker Immortal transport me to a rainbow devil lair? Can I summon Shenron to grant me a wish after I gather all seven devils? If I’m given a wish, I have to get Shenron to change my luck. Even if I can’t be as lucky as Wang Lu, it will allow me to live a peaceful life.</p>
<p>Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was ganked by three devils as the Chaos Egg flew around like a baseball. The solid Essence Energy Crystals in it rapidly increased, and in a short period of time, it nearly filled the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen was prepared. He used Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping to transfer the solid Essence Energy crystals condensed from the Chaos Egg to Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the three devils’ strength and speed were terrifying, but they weren’t to the point of directly blasting apart the Chaos Egg. Zhou Wen could barely preserve his life.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare run further. After running for so long, he hadn’t found an opportunity to escape. Instead, he attracted two more devils. Who knew how many more devils there would be if he continued running?</p>
<p>I don’t have many cards that I can use. Only the Immortal Culling Sword and the Golden Sniper are still useful, but under the siege of three devils, it’s too difficult to deliver a counterattack. Zhou Wen thought about it and didn’t think of a way to resolve his current predicament.</p>
<p>If Truth Listener can come out, there might still be hope. Zhou Wen tried summoning Truth Listener again. Although he could sense the connection with Truth Listener, he couldn’t get Truth Listener out of its earring form.</p>
<p>As for Tyrant Behemoth, after devouring a large number of Essence Energy Crystals, it showed signs of breaking through.</p>
<p>This glutton is still the best. As long as there’s food, it can evolve. Zhou Wen was very envious, but even if Tyrant Behemoth advanced to the Calamity grade, it would only be at the Human Realm. Under such circumstances, it wasn’t of much use.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Tyrant Behemoth only showed signs of evolution. It was unknown how long it would take for it to truly evolve.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen thought of Demonic Neonate, but he was somewhat hesitant.</p>
<p>In fact, when he first saw the devil, Zhou Wen had already thought of Demonic Neonate. Demonic Neonate seemed to have an inextricable connection with the creatures of the demonic realm, but Demonic Neonate looked like she was related to the East District’s demonic realm. Grim Demon was also a Guardian of the East District’s demonic realm.</p>
<p>As for devils, they were devils from the West District. He didn’t know if Demonic Neonate would be useful.</p>
<p>After all, she was only at the Mythical stage. If they didn’t acknowledge her, she probably wouldn’t be able to withstand a single slap.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was protected by the Chaos Egg. Demonic Neonate was petite, so she could be summoned inside the Chaos Egg. He could summon her to take a look.</p>
<p>Since there was no other way, Zhou Wen summoned Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate appeared in Zhou Wen’s arms while carrying the Demonic Sword. Her clear eyes seemed to be able to penetrate the Chaos Egg as she stared at the devils attacking the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>The purple devil’s claws stabbed into the Chaos Egg, severely deforming it before it bounced off at the speed of light.</p>
<p>In the air, the red devil had already caught up. He kicked the Chaos Egg and sent it flying like a baseball.</p>
<p>The spatial compression in the Chaos Egg pressed Demonic Neonate’s face against Zhou Wen’s chest, causing it to deform. The Essence Energy Crystals that condensed landed on Demonic Neonate’s body, almost burying her.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was just about to teleport the Essence Energy Crystal to Tyrant Behemoth and get Demonic Neonate to take a good look to see if it was possible to placate the three devils when Demonic Neonate’s figure surprisingly flashed as she rushed out of the Chaos Egg. As though she had teleported, she appeared outside the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Why did she leave! Zhou Wen was alarmed because the red devil was charging at Demonic Neonate. Its dagger-like nails were about to stab Demonic Neonate’s face.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wore a look of horror. He wanted to pull Demonic Neonate back, but it was too late.</p>
<p>Unbeknown to him, the red devil also wore a look of horror. Its high-speed body came to an abrupt halt, stopping in front of Demonic Neonate before its nails touched her.</p>
<p>Its nails were less than a centimeter away from Demonic Neonate’s face.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could even see the red devil’s forehead sweating.</p>
<p>The scene froze for a second before the red devil seemed to come to its senses. It suddenly retracted its claws and took two steps back. Then, with a plop, it knelt in front of Demonic Neonate and prostrated on the ground. It wasn’t just the red devil. The blue and purple devils on the other two sides also prostrated.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1525'>Chapter 1525 Land of the Fallen</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised. He never expected Demonic Neonate to be so useful. These three devils were likely existences at the Hell level. It was truly surprising that they were so afraid of the Mythical Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>Hum!</p>
<p>The red devil released its claw and the Golden Wyrm Scissors returned to Zhou Wen’s hand.</p>
<p>With the Golden Wyrm Scissors in hand, Zhou Wen regained some of his confidence. He stood behind Demonic Neonate and sized up the three trembling devils who were prostrating on the ground.</p>
<p>From their present state, it was difficult to imagine that they were Hell-level existences.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate reached out to grab the hilt of the Demonic Sword, but she didn’t pull it out. Together with the scabbard, she slammed it on the red devil’s head.</p>
<p>The red devil didn’t dare move. It allowed Demonic Neonate to smash it a few times, but it still lay there, not daring to resist.</p>
<p>After hitting it a few times, Demonic Neonate seemed to be appeased. Only then did she retract the Demonic Sword and hug it in her arms again. She floated in the air and looked around for a while.</p>
<p>“Over there.” Demonic Neonate landed on Zhou Wen’s shoulder and pointed in a direction. Clearly, she wanted Zhou Wen to head over.</p>
<p>“What’s there?” Zhou Wen asked curiously as he walked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Demonic Neonate shook her head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wore an odd expression, but at that moment, he could only listen to Demonic Neonate and fly over.</p>
<p>The three devils didn’t dare get up. They were like monkeys on all fours as they crawled behind Zhou Wen. They didn’t dare get too close, nor did they dare stay too far. They looked very nervous and awkward. “Neonate, do you know where this is?” Zhou Wen asked Demonic Neonate again.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate shook her head again. This time, she didn’t even say a word.</p>
<p>That’s true. Demonic Neonate was originally a muddle-headed toddler. After I killed her, she was absorbed by the Dead Man Tree and reborn as a Companion Beast. She no longer has her former memories. Even if she knew where this place was in the past, she shouldn’t know now. Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he said to Demonic Neonate, “Neonate, release Grim Demon. I have something to ask him.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, Demonic Neonate automatically unsheathed the Demonic Sword in her arms. A demonic aura surged out and quickly transformed into Grim Demon.</p>
<p>“Boohoo, I’m finally out. The air outside is so sweet…” After Grim Demon came out, he greedily took a breath, so excited that he was on the brink of tears.</p>
<p>“Ah!” When Grim Demon saw the three devils behind him, he was immediately given a fright. He flew backward and was about to escape into the Demonic Sword.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate struck him on the head with the sword, knocking Grim Demon to the ground.</p>
<p>Grim Demon got up from the ground as though his mind had cleared up. He stood up and shouted majestically at the three devils, “Three puny devils. How dare you act so presumptuously in front of your Grandpa Grim Demon? Quickly kneel down and apologize to me.”</p>
<p>The three devils ignored him and only looked at Demonic Neonate’s expression from afar.</p>
<p>“Cut the crap. Grim Demon, do you know where this is?” Zhou Wen said with a frown.</p>
<p>“What else could it be? Of course it’s the territory of the Devils. Why are you here? Why did you come to the dimension for no reason? Do you think you’ve lived too long? Isn’t it nice to live a comfortable life? Thankfully, this is a place for the Devils. With my lady here, she can protect you. If you were anywhere else, you would have been chopped up countless times. It’s fine if you die, but don’t implicate my lady…” Grim Demon shouted unhappily. Zhou Wen thought to himself, Do you think I want to come to this crappy place? I was forcefully sent in here, alright!?</p>
<p>“You said that this is the dimension? Then why don’t I sense the dimension’s laws suppressing me?” The last time Zhou Wen came to the dimension, he couldn’t see anything. Everything around him seemed distorted and abstract. Furthermore, there was a huge pressure, but that didn’t exist here.</p>
<p>“It’s different here.” Grim Demon looked at the surrounding sea of flowers and said with a strange expression, “If I’m not wrong, this should be the Land of the Fallen.”</p>
<p>“Land of the Fallen?” Zhou Wen had never heard of such a place.</p>
<p>“Haven’t you heard of the myths and legends of the fallen angels from the West District?” Grim Demon frowned.</p>
<p>“Are you talking about Satan or Lucifer?” Zhou Wen knew that there were actually several versions of the Fallen Angel. He knew more about Satan and Lucifer’s versions. Some people also said that Satan was Lucifer.</p>
<p>Satan, the lord of all evil, originally lived in Heaven, but due to his defeat in the war with God, he was banished to hell.</p>
<p>Legend had it that Lucifer was an angel, and he was the angel closest to God. Later, God created the progenitor of humanity, Adam, and named him the Messiah. He requested angels to kneel and worship Adam.</p>
<p>Michael and the other angels followed God’s orders and knelt in front of Adam. Only Lucifer didn’t kneel.</p>
<p>Lucifer believed that angels had lost their freedom by serving God. If they knelt before humans again, even their dignity and pride would be lost. Therefore, he refused to kneel before Adam.</p>
<p>The angels behind Lucifer also refused to kneel to Adam. They abandoned their faith and fear and plucked up their courage to fight God. Although they were ultimately defeated and banished to hell, Lucifer became synonymous with the terms pride and dignity. He was also the King of Hell.</p>
<p>“Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven”—this was Lucifer’s famous saying.</p>
<p>Of course, there were also people who said that Satan and Lucifer were the same person. There were also various versions of legends that Zhou Wen didn’t understand in detail. That was all he knew.</p>
<p>“In fact, I’ve never been to the dimension’s Land of the Fallen, nor do I know if Satan and Lucifer are the same person. However, in the divine wars during Earth’s mythical era, there were once fallen angels and demons participating in the battle. One of the fallen angels was extremely terrifying. Under the suppression of Earth’s rules, it still killed countless deities. As it was dyed with too much divine blood, its pure white feathers were dyed black by layers of blood. It was one of the few existences that could barely match me…”</p>
<p>After a pause, Grim Demon continued, “I heard them say that they come from the Land of the Fallen. It’s a place of imprisonment that grants them immortality. There are endless flowers that never wither. It represents eternal life, but it also represents eternal damnation.”</p>
<p>“Since the Land of the Fallen is the territory of the fallen angels, it shouldn’t be the same place as yours, right? Why are these devils afraid of Neonate?” Zhou Wen stared at Grim Demon and asked. Grim Demon clearly knew something about Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>Grim Demon looked at Zhou Wen in contempt and said, “Don’t use your narrow and ignorant standards to measure my lady. Ignoring mere devils, even…”</p>
<p>As though realizing that he had said too much, Grim Demon changed the topic and said, “However, in my lady’s present state, it’s best not to let those terrifying fellows see her. It will be troublesome if she’s recognized. Why did you come here for no reason? Are you courting death?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1526'>Chapter 1526 Satan?</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen asked Grim Demon a few more questions, but Grim Demon wasn’t willing to elaborate on Demonic Neonate. It was useless no matter how Zhou Wen threatened him.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate didn’t seem to care about her origins. She sat on Zhou Wen’s shoulder as though she was listening to something that had nothing to do with her.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen proceeded in the direction Demonic Neonate had pointed. As for what was there, even Grim Demon didn’t know. This was the first time Grim Demon had come to the Land of the Fallen. He had only heard of it in the past, so he had no idea what was there. He couldn’t sense what was in the direction Demonic Neonate had pointed in either.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen walked for some time, he found another devil in front of him. This time, it was a golden devil.</p>
<p>The golden devil’s reaction when it saw Demonic Neonate was the same as the three previous devils. It immediately prostrated as though it had seen its god.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate ignored him and pointed in another direction. Zhou Wen had no choice but to continue walking over.</p>
<p>The places Demonic Neonate pointed each had a devil-red, blue, purple, gold, green, white, and black. All seven devils were really gathered.</p>
<p>Could these things really be used to summon Shenron? That’s not right. Even if something can be summoned, it should be summoning the devil king himself, Satan. Zhou Wen thought to himself, but he didn’t stop walking. He continued walking in the direction Demonic Neonate had pointed.</p>
<p>As the sea of flowers was boundless, Zhou Wen wouldn’t know where the exit was without following Demonic Neonate’s directions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, without Demonic Neonate suppressing those devils, there was almost no chance of Zhou Wen fighting seven alone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that another devil would appear, but he didn’t encounter another devil after a long walk. Even Grim Demon felt a little impatient.</p>
<p>This place was beautiful, but no matter how beautiful it was, it felt infinitely repetitive after being inundated by the same sights. It slowly became terrifying. This sea of flowers was the same. It was beautiful at first glance, but the longer it lasted, the more eerie and terrifying it became. Zhou Wen didn’t think it was wrong to call it hell.</p>
<p>After walking for an unknown period of time, a different scene finally appeared in front of them—a strange building.</p>
<p>The building looked like a foundation, like the bottom of an incomplete pyramid. However, a pyramid wasn’t in the same system as angels and devils. It didn’t seem to belong here.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate seemed to sense something as she pointed at the strange building and said, “There.”</p>
<p>“What’s there?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Demonic Neonate shook her head again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to fly up. He wanted to see what was inside the building from afar.</p>
<p>He flew into the air and carefully observed the building. Although the building looked like the bottom of a pyramid, it was still somewhat different.</p>
<p>The building looked like it was made of rocks, but upon careful inspection, the rocks were somewhat special. They didn’t seem to be real rocks, but more like some kind of concrete. Many of the rocks were mixed with gravel and shells.</p>
<p>There were many broken walls on it. He couldn’t tell if they had not been completed or if they had been destroyed after completion. However, he was certain that this building looked nothing like the original building. There should be at least one floor or more above it. For some reason, there was only the lowest floor left.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still observing the strange building when Demonic Neonate jumped down and walked towards the door on the side of the building.</p>
<p>This building’s style was very strange, and it was difficult to tell where it came from. Seeing Demonic Neonate walk towards the door, the seven devils quickly circled the door and prostrated in front of it. They kowtowed to Demonic Neonate as though begging her not to enter.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate ignored them as Grim Demon charged forward and kicked the devil in front of Demonic Neonate to the side.</p>
<p>With Demonic Neonate around, the few devils didn’t dare resist. They only knelt by the side and kowtowed repeatedly. They whispered as though they were pleading.</p>
<p>“Scram, scram, what are you screaming for?” Grim Demon led the way and protected Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched from behind with an odd expression. No matter how he looked at the scene, it felt like a landowner bullying the poor with his servants.</p>
<p>However, when he thought of how these bullied fellows were terrifying existences at the Hell level, Zhou Wen found it odder.</p>
<p>Grim Demon pushed open the sealed door and air rushed into the building as dust flew everywhere. It was unknown how long it had been since someone had entered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed Demonic Neonate into the building and immediately realized that there were no statues or murals related to religions in the huge building.</p>
<p>There were only some simple symbols and words inside the building. In the middle of the building was a platform with many flowers on it.</p>
<p>From the looks of the flowers, they must have been plucked from outside and placed on the platform. It was unknown how long they had been lying there, but the flowers were still fresh and beautiful. There were no signs of them withering.</p>
<p>And on the flowers lay a girl with long silver hair.</p>
<p>The girl looked no different from a human. She wore a white nightgown as though she was asleep. However, Zhou Wen couldn’t hear her breathing, nor did he sense any vitality from her.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen saw the girl’s face, his mouth gaped open. He was speechless.</p>
<p>The long-haired woman’s looks were very similar to Sweetie’s. However, Sweetie was blonde while she had silver hair. The other parts of her were very similar. Even her height and weight were very similar. If Sweetie is really God… Then this silver-haired girl… Could she be the legendary Satan… Zhou Wen found it increasingly odd.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate wasn’t in the mood to size up the girl like Zhou Wen. She walked straight to the platform.</p>
<p>The seven devils also crawled in and knelt in front of the stone platform. They kept kowtowing to Demonic Neonate as they let out sobbing sounds. It was obvious that they were pleading</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate ignored them and walked onto the stone platform. She stepped on the petals and reached out to touch the girl.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate’s body seemed to be suddenly repelled by a force. Like a cannonball, she slammed into the distant wall.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen instant transmitted over and pressed a hand on Demonic Neonate’s back. Immediately, he felt a massive force surge over.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping to draw the force acting on Demonic Neonate into his body before pressing one hand on the wall.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The rocks under Zhou Wen’s palm shattered as cracks radiated outward.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate seemed extremely indignant as she flashed to the front of the platform and stared intently at the girl’s body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed her and traced Demonic Neonate’s gaze. He saw the girl’s finger. On her finger was a ring with a gem embedded in it.</p>
<p>The gem was crystalline and shimmered like a star. The brilliance was clear but not cold.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1527'>Chapter 1527 The Gem on the Ring</h3>
<p>Demonic Neonate wanted to reach out to pluck the girl’s ring, but after some hesitation, she didn’t extend her hand. She turned to look at Zhou Wen with a pleading look in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Grim Demon, do you know the origins of this girl?” Zhou Wen asked Grim Demon.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen her before. At the very least, she didn’t appear in the wars of the Mythical era.” Grim Demon looked carefully for a while and said after some thought, “However, to be protected by these seven extraordinary devils, she must have a huge background. It’s best not to touch her if possible.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also felt that it was best not to touch her if he could. She resembled Sweetie too much. If she was really as powerful as Sweetie, it would be impossible to take anything from her.</p>
<p>However, this girl looked lifeless. The huge commotion just now hadn’t woken her up. She might already be dead.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen decided to give it a try after looking down at Demonic Neonate and seeing her expectant gaze. Zhou Wen knew that although his level was higher than Demonic Neonate’s, it wasn’t that much safer for him to retrieve something that Demonic Neonate couldn’t.</p>
<p>After summoning and putting on the Prisoned Dragon armor, Zhou Wen gathered all his strength to defend himself. Only then did he reach out to take off the girl’s ring.</p>
<p>The seven devils bared their teeth as though they wanted to skin Zhou Wen alive. Demonic Neonate glared at them before they immediately shrank back, only to glare at Zhou Wen from below.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen’s fingers touched the ring, he felt a powerful expelled force. His body slammed into the wall like a pellet.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen summoned the Chaos Egg in time. It bounced back and forth between the walls before slowly stopping.</p>
<p>Why is this power much stronger than when Demonic Neonate made the attempt? Zhou Wen spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>
<p>Although Demonic Neonate had been repelled by the force when retrieving it, the force was clearly much weaker than Zhou Wen’s attempt. Otherwise, Demonic Neonate’s body probably wouldn’t have been able to withstand the instantaneous force that sent her flying</p>
<p>Zhou Wen returned to the platform and looked at the silver-haired girl with a frown; he had no idea if she was alive or dead.</p>
<p>He had pretty good recovery abilities, so his injuries were slowly recovering, but even if he recovered, he probably couldn’t take the ring if he tried the same method.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate was still staring at the ring. Clearly, she was very concerned about it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared at the ring for a while longer. The ring was made of metal, but he didn’t know what metal it was. The gem wasn’t a diamond. Amidst its crystalline appearance, there was a faint blue tinge.</p>
<p>It was clearly transparent, but no matter how he looked at it, he couldn’t see the gem’s interior.</p>
<p>“Do you want the ring or the gem?” Zhou Wen asked Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>“Gem,” Demonic Neonate hurriedly said.</p>
<p>“That makes things easier.” Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors and got it to snip at the ring’s metal ring with Clean Break.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>With a metallic clang, the Golden Wyrm Scissors, which could split Hell-level creatures and weapons into two, failed to leave a mark on the metal ring.</p>
<p>Instead, the Golden Wyrm Scissors was sent flying, nearly grazing Zhou Wen’s cheek. If Zhou Wen hadn’t dodged quickly, half his head would have been chopped off.</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrm Scissors stabbed into the wall, leaving only the handle outside. The Golden Wyrm Scissors trembled for a while before flying back out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed. The powerful destructive power of the Golden Wyrm Scissors failed to injure the ring. It was probably very difficult to remove the ring.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate wanted the ring so much, so it was probably essential to her. It was very likely to help her evolve. Zhou Wen didn’t wish to give up just like that.</p>
<p>It was too difficult to evolve Demonic Neonate. She didn’t eat crystals at all. Ordinary things couldn’t help her evolve. It wasn’t easy for him to find something she needed, so he had to give it another try.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and summoned the Immortal Culling Sword again. He slashed at the ring with all his might.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Immortal Culling Sword flew out, but the ring remained unharmed.</p>
<p>What’s this ring? Is this girl really Satan? Zhou Wen increasingly felt that the possibility of the girl being Satan was very high.</p>
<p>In many legends, Satan was a monster like a snake or a crimson dragon, but the girl in front of him was abnormally beautiful. If she was Satan, Zhou Wen was more willing to believe that Satan and Lucifer were the same person.</p>
<p>Sweetie is God, so Lucifer, the fallen angel, is this girl. It seems reasonable. After all, angels are also created by God. Perhaps Lucifer was created in God’s image. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and decided to give it another try.</p>
<p>Since it was impossible to forcefully snap the ring, Zhou Wen could only think of a way to remove it from the girl’s finger.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen cultivated in many Essence Energy Arts. He circulated different Essence Energy Arts, hoping that there was a power that prevented the ring or the girl’s powers from rejecting him. Perhaps he could successfully remove the ring.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The First Order of Chaos failed to succeed as Zhou Wen was sent flying.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The Dao Sutra failed as well.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>The Qi Refinement Art, Demon God Bloodline Catalog, Godfiend Era, and other Essence Energy Arts failed one after another. As long as he touched the ring, Zhou Wen would immediately be repelled.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and walked to the girl’s side again. This time, he circulated the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. This was already his last Essence Energy Art. If it didn’t work, he would probably have to give up.</p>
<p>The Human Sovereign glow on Zhou Wen’s body bloomed, turning him into a blob of light. He extended his glowing palm and touched the ring again.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was sent flying faster than ever, almost at light speed. He slammed into the wall before he could even summon the Chaos</p>
<p>Egg.</p>
<p>With a loud boom, even the extremely hard and thick wall collapsed.</p>
<p>Cracks appeared on Zhou Wen’s Prisoned Dragon armor as a large area on his back shattered.</p>
<p>Pfft! Blood spewed out of Zhou Wen’s mouth as he struggled to get onto his feet a few times, but to no avail. He felt as though his body had fallen apart with an unknown number of bones shattering.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate came to Zhou Wen’s side and sized up his injuries. Her eyes were filled with anxiety as she shook her head at him as though she wanted to tell him not to try again. She didn’t want the gem anymore.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned a Mythical pill essence and swallowed it as a pill. His injuries rapidly healed and he quickly recovered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood up and wanted to walk towards the girl, but Demonic Neonate grabbed his clothes.</p>
<p>“Don’t want.” Demonic Neonate shook her head at Zhou Wen with a firm gaze.</p>
<p>“I’ve already tried so many times, so one more won’t make a difference.” Zhou Wen wanted to try again without using any other powers; he would only use the Lost Immortal Sutra this time.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1528'>Chapter 1528 Success</h3>
<p>The Lost Immortal Sutra itself was very pure without any special attributes. It didn’t have much augmentation effect on the body. Only its usage of Essence Energy was very powerful.</p>
<p>However, this strength wasn’t targeted at combat. Therefore, Zhou Wen seldom used the Lost Immortal Sutra in combat. He would basically add a simulated Essence Energy Art to it.</p>
<p>I hope it’s of some use. Zhou Wen was only making a last-ditch effort. At this stage, he couldn’t give up unless he tried all the possibilities.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen didn’t even need to circulate the Lost Immortal Sutra himself. It constantly circulated in his body.</p>
<p>He removed the various augmentation powers and restored the most primitive state of the Lost Immortal Sutra. “Even her lady can’t take it. It’s useless even if you try again. It’s best you leave quickly. I have a nagging feeling that something is amiss here.” Grim Demon didn’t wish to stay in such a dangerous place any longer and urged Zhou Wen to leave quickly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored him. After returning the Lost Immortal Sutra to its original form, he unsummoned the Prisoned Dragon armor on his body and extended his hand to touch the girl’s hand.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen knew that the chances of success weren’t high. Even the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping technique couldn’t remove the ring. The chances of an Essence Energy Art like the Lost Immortal Sutra without any special augmentation succeeding were slim.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to see if the Lost Immortal Sutra’s simulation ability was effective. Perhaps it could simulate the girl’s aura.</p>
<p>Of course, this was just a wild hope. The Demon God Bloodline Catalog couldn’t even scan the girl’s body and transform him into her appearance. An Essence Energy Art like the Lost Immortal Sutra that purely simulated auras probably had nothing when the other party had zero aurae.</p>
<p>With all sorts of thoughts flashing through his mind, Zhou Wen’s finger touched the ring on the girl’s finger.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already prepared to be sent flying, but nothing happened when his fingertip touched the ring.</p>
<p>“I’m fine!” Zhou Wen was overjoyed.</p>
<p>Although the Lost Immortal Sutra couldn’t simulate the girl’s aura, the girl was like a dead person. There was no aura, nor was there any way to simulate it.</p>
<p>However, the ordinary Lost Immortal Sutra allowed Zhou Wen to finally touch the ring.</p>
<p>“Gal, the ring is useless with you anyway. Lend it to me. If you need anything in the future, tell me in a dream. If you want clothes, houses, or money, I’ll burn them all for you,” Zhou Wen said as he carefully lifted the girl’s finger and slowly removed the ring with his other hand.</p>
<p>Roar! Seeing the ring slide across the girl’s slender fingers, the seven devils immediately flew into a rage. All sorts of light spewed out from their bodies, transforming into devil phantoms that enveloped their bodies. All of them roared ferociously, gearing to rush over and tear Zhou Wen apart.</p>
<p>“Scram!” Demonic Neonate shouted softly. The auras of the seven enraged devils immediately extinguished. Although they didn’t immediately retreat, they didn’t dare rush forward anymore. They stood there with conflicted expressions.</p>
<p>Taking this opportunity, Zhou Wen took the ring from the girl’s finger. Nothing happened.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Zhou Wen placed the ring in his palm and pressed his palms together. He bowed at the girl before throwing the ring to Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>“How did you remove it? Don’t tell me you were deliberately putting on an act to win my lady’s favor?” Grim Demon looked at Zhou Wen suspiciously.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had unleashed all sorts of powers without being able to remove the ring. Yet, he now managed to remove the ring without doing anything special. It made Grim Demon suspect that his previous actions were just an act.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered with him. When the seven devils saw the ring land in Demonic Neonate’s hand, they deflated and didn’t rush forward again.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate caught the ring in her left palm. The ring itself didn’t reject her. When Demonic Neonate’s finger touched the gem on the ring, the gem was like a water droplet that landed on Demonic Neonate’s fingertip. It shook slightly like water droplets on a lotus leaf or transparent jelly.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate threw the ring on the ground and placed the jelly-like gem into her mouth.</p>
<p>What a prodigal! Zhou Wen hurriedly picked up the ring when he saw Demonic Neonate throw it to the ground.</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrm Scissors and the Immortal Culling Sword had failed to scuff the ring. It was obvious that it was extraordinary.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the ring and wiped the dust off it with his hand, planning on putting it in the chaos space. Perhaps it would be of some use in the future.</p>
<p>Before putting it in, Zhou Wen tried pinching it, but to his surprise, the metal ring snapped with a crack.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately dumbfounded when he saw the ring break into several pieces.</p>
<p>What the hell is this? It was clearly so hard just now. Why did it suddenly become so weak! Zhou Wen couldn’t accept this outcome. He picked up the fragments and pinched them again, only to have them shatter into smaller pieces.</p>
<p>Isn’t this just ordinary metal? Zhou Wen was at a loss whether to laugh or cry. After all this trouble, this thing was basically ordinary metal. The only good thing was the gem. The ring’s former hardness was either a result of the gem or the strangeness of the girl’s body.</p>
<p>After Demonic Neonate ate the gem, she staggered as though she was drunk and fell.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly flashed to Demonic Neonate’s side and picked her up.</p>
<p>“Neonate, are you alright?” Zhou Wen patted Demonic Neonate’s cheek, hoping to wake her up.</p>
<p>“I’m about to sleep…” Demonic Neonate couldn’t even open her eyes as she said in a daze. She turned around and curled up in Zhou Wen’s arms. She grabbed Zhou Wen’s clothes and quickly fell asleep.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen called out a few more times, but Demonic Neonate didn’t respond at all. She fell asleep just like that.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Is she evolving? Zhou Wen looked at Demonic Neonate in his arms and was momentarily at a loss.</p>
<p>Typically, when Companion Beasts evolved, their bodies would rapidly mutate. Even the types with slower mutations would form an energy barrier, allowing them to slowly evolve in an energy environment.</p>
<p>However, Demonic Neonate only looked drunk and asleep. There were no intense energy fluctuations from her body, nor did her body undergo any abnormal changes.</p>
<p>What was even stranger was that Zhou Wen couldn’t unsummon Demonic Neonate when he tried</p>
<p>“Grim Demon, what’s going on?” Zhou Wen looked at Grim Demon and asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“This… I’m not too sure either… I told you to leave… You randomly gave her lady food… Look, there’s a problem now…” Grim Demon wasn’t sure what was going on.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to scan Demonic Neonate’s body, but he didn’t discover any problems. It was as though she had really fallen asleep.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The stone platform beneath their feet suddenly shook as Zhou Wen and Grim Demon hurriedly flew up. The stone platform where the silver-haired girl lay slowly sank.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1529'>Chapter 1529 A Lost Paradise</h3>
<p>The stone platform slowly sank, revealing a bottomless abyss beneath it. There was no light in the deep hole below. Even looking into it made one feel as though they were being devoured.</p>
<p>As the stone platform descended, the girl lying on it gradually became blurry.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was sizing up the bottomless pit when he suddenly saw the girl open her eyes and smile at him strangely. She opened her mouth as though she was saying something.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t hear anything, nor did he know what she was talking about.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but tremble as the girl and the stone platform sank into the bottomless abyss, nowhere to be seen again.</p>
<p>“Was that an illusion?” Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if he had really seen the girl open her eyes and speak.</p>
<p>However, he remembered the pair of silver irises and the strange smile very clearly.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be an illusion, right? Zhou Wen tried his best to recall the girl’s mouth shapes, hoping to guess what she was mouthing.</p>
<p>However, before Zhou Wen could give it much thought, the entire building collapsed as though there was an earthquake. The seven devils glared at Zhou Wen and jumped into the bottomless abyss. In the blink of an eye, the seven devils were gone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Grim Demon didn’t dare take the risk to jump in. All they could do was escape the building. Not long after they came out, the building completely collapsed as though it had been sucked into a bottomless abyss. Soon, even the ruins vanished. The bottomless abyss-like crater was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>The spot where the building was originally located turned into a mud pit. Soon, ageless flowers grew out of the pit as though the building and the bottomless abyss had never existed.</p>
<p>“Grim Demon, did you see that girl open her eyes?” Zhou Wen asked Grim Demon.</p>
<p>“No, when did she open her eyes?” Grim Demon asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Not long after the stone platform sank into the crater and was about to enter the darkness, she seemed to open her eyes and mouth something. Didn’t you see it?” Zhou Wen explained in detail.</p>
<p>“Were you seeing things? I was staring at her from beginning to end. I didn’t see her open her eyes even when she vanished, much less speak,” Grim Demon said with certainty.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned silently. Although he felt his mind go adrift for a little moment as though he was dreaming, his brain still remembered it clearly. It was unlikely to be a mistake.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t ask further since Grim Demon didn’t see her. He looked at Demonic Neonate in his arms. She was still sleeping soundly. Her lips were even sucking her thumb.</p>
<p>“We have to think of a way to return.” Zhou Wen looked around, hoping to find a way to return to Earth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously been to the dimension, but he had Ice Maiden leading the way, allowing him to return. He didn’t know how to return now.</p>
<p>“I think we should stay here and wait for my lady to wake up. It might be more dangerous to run around in such a place,” said Grim Demon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally knew that Grim Demon was right, but he didn’t know when Demonic Neonate would wake up.</p>
<p>If Demonic Neonate was really evolving, according to Zhou Wen’s previous experience, the higher the Companion Beast’s level, the longer it took to evolve. It would be considered quick if a Companion Beast took about half a month to advance to the Terror grade.</p>
<p>It could take as long as months. It was impossible for Zhou Wen to wait that long and do nothing.</p>
<p>There was still an endless sea of flowers around him. Apart from that, there was nothing else. Apart from flowers, there was no vitality in the world.</p>
<p>The vitality of the flowers was very strange. They looked brimming with vitality, but they also had a deathly aura that resembled ashes.</p>
<p>“Grim Demon, what else do you know about the Land of the Fallen?” Zhou Wen asked Grim Demon.</p>
<p>“Nothing much… By the way… I seem to remember hearing an angel mention it… The Land of the Fallen is also called a Lost Paradise… It’s a place without happiness with eternal misfortune…” Grim Demon said as he tried his best to recall.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen heard the words “Lost Paradise,” he thought of a mythical epic called “Lost Paradise.” The story was related to Satan.</p>
<p>After Satan was defeated, he was banished to hell by God, but Satan was unwilling to admit defeat. He waited for an opportunity to seek revenge.</p>
<p>Satan finally found an opportunity to turn into a snake and entered the Garden of Eden. He tempted Adam and Eve to secretly eat the forbidden fruit. In the end, Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>This was only a mythical epic. Even if there was really the Garden of Eden, it was difficult to say if there was Adam and Eve.</p>
<p>Is Sweetie living in the Garden of Eden? Zhou Wen suddenly thought of Sweetie, but he couldn’t associate her image with the omnipotent God.</p>
<p>Grim Demon recalled some hearsay information, but it didn’t help Zhou Wen’s present situation. He still couldn’t think of a way to leave.</p>
<p>“Hell is a prison used to imprison devils. Even in the dimension, this is an extremely special place. It’s definitely not that easy to leave this place. Let’s wait for my lady to wake up before making plans.” Grim Demon tried his best to persuade Zhou Wen not to act rashly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of loneliness. It wasn’t a problem for him to stay here for a few years, but something could happen at Guide City at any time. Zhou Wen was afraid that Li Xuan and company wouldn’t be able to handle it.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen carried Demonic Neonate and walked away. He decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>However, as Zhou Wen walked, he discovered something very magical. When he walked forward, the flowers in front of him automatically parted to make a path.</p>
<p>These flowers can move on their own? Then why didn’t I see them move before? Zhou Wen attempted to walk in another direction.</p>
<p>However, no matter where Zhou Wen went, the flowers in front of him automatically made way as though they were avoiding him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at Demonic Neonate in his arms and said to Grim Demon, “Walk to the other side.”</p>
<p>Grim Demon walked to the side, but the flowers didn’t make way for him.</p>
<p>“Take her.” Zhou Wen handed Demonic Neonate to Grim Demon and tried it himself. Like Grim Demon, the flowers didn’t make way for him.</p>
<p>It was obvious that the flowers were making way for Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>This didn’t happen when I summoned Demonic Neonate. From the looks of it, it’s because Demonic Neonate ate that gem. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and carried Demonic Neonate as he continued walking forward.</p>
<p>Wherever Zhou Wen or Demonic Neonate went, the flowers avoided them, forming a path between the flowers. Zhou Wen walked along with it.</p>
<p>Not long after, Zhou Wen and Grim Demon were surprised to discover that they had reached the end of the sea of flowers. In the distance, they could see a continuous mountain range.</p>
<p>They could see smoke billowing. A small city sat at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1530'>Chapter 1530: Eat Me If You Want To Eat</h3>

<p>Humans! There are humans there? Zhou Wen saw humans in the city from afar. Furthermore, there were quite a number of them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to carefully scan the area a few more times. After confirming that the other party were humans and not humanoid dimensional creatures, he looked at Grim Demon and asked, “Grim Demon, are you sure this is the dimension’s Land of the Fallen?”</p>
<p>“Well…” Grim Demon was originally very certain, but he became somewhat unsure upon seeing the humans in the city.</p>
<p>The creatures that could survive in the dimension were at least at the Mythical stage. How many Mythical creatures could there be among humans? In the small city ahead, there were at least a hundred thousand people. It was unknown if all the elites in Earth’s Federation added up could gather that many Mythical humans.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the small city was bordering the Land of the Fallen. Ignoring humans, even powerful dimensional creatures wouldn’t choose to build a city here.</p>
<p>Seeing that Grim Demon wasn’t sure, Zhou Wen immediately walked towards the city.</p>
<p>The sea of flowers stopped at a cliff. Beneath it was a bottomless abyss. On the other side of the cliff was a continuous mountain range. The small city was built on the mountain opposite.</p>
<p>There was no path to the small city on the other side. However, the bottomless abyss wasn’t a problem for Zhou Wen and Grim Demon. They could easily fly over it.</p>
<p>For safety’s sake, Zhou Wen even released a Musical Note Sprite to probe. The Musical Note Sprite flew freely in the air without discovering any danger. Only then did Zhou Wen fly towards the human city opposite with Demonic Neonate in his arms.</p>
<p>The city was built on a mountain. On the side facing the cliff, there were gates. Outside the gates was a platform. Some humans were setting up stalls on the platform. It was a lively market with many people.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen flew over with Demonic Neonate in his arms, he didn’t conceal himself with his Terror transformation powers. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to hide, but Demonic Neonate couldn’t be hidden. It was pointless for him to hide.</p>
<p>Soon, many people saw Zhou Wen fly over with Demonic Neonate in his arms. As for Grim Demon, ordinary people couldn’t see him due to his Terror transformation.</p>
<p>Everyone stood up and widened their eyes, staring blankly at Zhou Wen when they saw him.</p>
<p>They seemed to have seen something unbelievable. Their eyes widened as they stood rooted to the ground in shock.</p>
<p>Everyone who saw Zhou Wen had the same expression.</p>
<p>The stall owners stopped peddling their wares and the buyers forgot the items in their hands as they looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“May I ask where this is?” Zhou Wen flew to a spot near the platform and greeted while asking.</p>
<p>He had a nagging feeling that something was amiss with this city and these humans, but he couldn’t tell what was amiss.</p>
<p>“Ah!” At that moment, everyone seemed to awaken from a dream. As though they had seen something terrifying, they screamed and turned to flee into the city.</p>
<p>Someone even threw out the things in their hands. Instantly, the market was in a frenzy. When Zhou Wen snapped to his senses, the huge market was empty. The ground was in a mess.</p>
<p>“Do I look that terrifying?” Zhou Wen touched his face and asked Grim Demon.</p>
<p>“You are a little ugly compared to me, but it’s not to the point of being terrifying. The residents of this small city probably haven’t seen much, so they haven’t seen anything uglier. Don’t make a fuss,” Grim Demon said smugly.</p>
<p>If Demonic Neonate could still move, Zhou Wen would have gotten her to send Grim Demon back into the Demonic Sword. This fellow was born shameless.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carried Demonic Neonate into the city. When the humans realized that he had entered the city, they were even more alarmed. All of them fled with all their might. Even the humans in the city who didn’t know what had happened scrambled to escape.</p>
<p>The shop owners on both sides of the road shuttered their doors and windows tightly.</p>
<p>Soon, the long street was empty. The streets were filled with trash.</p>
<p>Is there something wrong with their heads? Zhou Wen took out a mirror and looked at himself, but he didn’t discover anything to be afraid of.</p>
<p>He had a nose and two eyes, just like them—a normal human.</p>
<p>“Are the humans in this city all mentally ill? What’s there to be afraid of when seeing a human?” Grim Demon clearly found it very strange.</p>
<p>“They aren’t mentally ill. They are just afraid of something.” Zhou Wen frowned in thought. Before he could figure it out, he saw the people who had escaped walking back in fear.</p>
<p>The person in the lead was an old man with white hair and a beard that almost reached his waist. He held a walking stick in his hand. His walking looked unstable as though he would fall at any moment.</p>
<p>Many people followed behind the elder and walked towards Zhou Wen and company. Their eyes were clearly filled with fear, but despite being so afraid, they slowly walked over with the elder.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood on the long street and waited for them to walk over. Since they were willing to come to him, it meant that they could still communicate. All he needed to do was make things clear.</p>
<p>Although they were in the dimension, they were humans after all. They should be easier to communicate with than dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Although the elder’s eyes were filled with fear, he still walked over step by step. When he was still dozens of meters away from Zhou Wen which wasn’t conducive for face-to-face communication, the elder suddenly threw away his cane and plopped to the ground with a grunt before bowing at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>With the elder prostrating, the crowd behind him did the same.</p>
<p>“Your Devilish Excellency, please spare that child’s life. If you want to eat her, eat me…” the elder said as he kowtowed with tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Zhou Wen was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>How did he become the His Devilish Excellency? Furthermore, he was only carrying Demonic Neonate. Such a gentle posture didn’t look like he wanted to eat her.</p>
<p>Are these people nuts? Zhou Wen looked at the people who were prostrating before him while begging him not to eat the child. Zhou Wen now agreed with Grim Demon’s view. Perhaps these people were really nuts.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that explaining to a group of lunatics that he wasn’t a devilish king or that he didn’t eat children was clearly a very difficult task. Therefore, he planned on going along with the conversation and figuring things out.</p>
<p>“How do you know that I’m the devil king?” Zhou Wen stared at the white-haired elder and asked.</p>
<p>The white-haired elder’s body trembled, but he quickly answered respectfully, “Apart from you, Your Devilish Excellency, who else can come out of the Lost Paradise? Apart from you, who else can transform into something looking so much like a human…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen opened his mouth and suddenly realized that it wasn’t easy to explain this matter.</p>
<p>It didn’t seem like these people would believe him even if he said that he was human.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1531'>Chapter 1531: Cemetery</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“I know who these people are!” Grim Demon suddenly shouted.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Grim Demon. As Grim Demon had always been in his Terror form, the others couldn’t see him.</p>
<p>Therefore, the elder and the group of fearful people only saw Zhou Wen turn his head to the side as though he was staring into the void. This made them panic even more. They increasingly found Zhou Wen incomprehensible. He was capricious, solid proof that he was the Lost Paradise’s devil king.</p>
<p>“They call this place Lost Paradise, not the Land of the Fallen, nor is it hell. If this place is really related to the myths and legends of Lost Paradise, it’s not difficult to guess the origins of these people. Adam and Eve were tempted by Satan and secretly ate the forbidden fruit before being expelled from the Garden of Eden. If the location of this story isn’t Earth but the dimension, then all of this can be explained,” Grim Demon said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood what Grim Demon meant. Grim Demon meant that these people were the descendants of Adam and Eve.</p>
<p>However, on second thought, Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. In the myths and legends of the pantheon of God, Adam and Eve should be the founders of humanity. According to Grim Demon’s guess, it didn’t seem right.</p>
<p>If Adam and Eve had reproduced here after being chased out of the Garden of Eden and they had never been to Earth, why would there be such legends on Earth?</p>
<p>As though reading Zhou Wen’s mind, Grim Demon said, “Adam and Eve betrayed God and secretly ate the forbidden fruit. After being banished, where could they go? Apart from a place like the Garden of Eden, the dimension wasn’t suitable for humans to survive. The only place they could go to was probably Lost Paradise. Look at their bodies. You can tell that there aren’t any Mythical humans among them. They are all Legendary or Epic creatures based on your standards. Yet, such standards can build a city in the dimension. Only by being protected by the Lost Paradise can this be possible.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that Grim Demon was right. He could already vaguely sense the dimensional nomological powers in this small mountain city, but it was much weaker than the true dimensional laws Zhou Wen had previously encountered.</p>
<p>This place was clearly affected by Lost Paradise, allowing these humans to survive here.</p>
<p>However, this was only Grim Demon’s guess. Perhaps these humans were sent over from Earth by dimensional experts as experimental subjects.</p>
<p>It was even possible that some humans on Earth had some fortuitous encounters and accidentally ended up here.</p>
<p>“You are the king of this city?” Zhou Wen stared at the elder and asked.</p>
<p>The elder was feeling uneasy and guessing what the devil king wanted after not getting a reply from Zhou Wen after quite some time. He jumped with fright at Zhou Wen’s abrupt question. He knelt on the ground and said in fear, “Your Devilish Excellency, you are the only king. I’m only the city lord of this city and your slave. If you need a living sacrifice, please take my life and spare the child.”</p>
<p>“Since you know that I’m the only king here, tell me. Who gave you the guts to negotiate with me?” Zhou Wen thought to himself, Instead of wasting my breath explaining, why don’t I use my identity as the devil king to figure things out?</p>
<p>Everyone was immediately alarmed and afraid. The elder kowtowed repeatedly. “Your Devilish Excellency, we definitely don’t have any intention of offending you, much less negotiating with you. We only wish to obtain your pity. Our ancestors were able to survive here because of your benevolence. Our lives are yours, and everything here is yours. How can we have the right to negotiate with you? We only hope that Your Devilish Excellency will be magnanimous…”</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen listened to the elder’s drone on, he increasingly felt that Grim Demon’s guess was right. These people might really be descendants of Adam and Eve.</p>
<p>“Take me around this city,” Zhou Wen said indifferently as he declined to comment on the elder’s pleas.</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Devilish Excellency. I’ll show you around. What do you want to see?” the elder hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” Zhou Wen glanced at him indifferently.</p>
<p>The elder immediately broke out into a cold sweat as his mind raced. Soon, he seemed to think of something and hurriedly said, “Your Devilish Excellency, I understand. Please follow me.”</p>
<p>The elder led the way while the others hurriedly retreated to the sides, not daring to be in Zhou Wen’s way.</p>
<p>The style of this city was very similar to the ancient style of the West District. Zhou Wen remembered that the word to describe it was ‘gothic.’</p>
<p>It was obvious that this place was very backward. There were no electronic devices or even lights. Clearly, there was zero technology here.</p>
<p>When he walked to the middle of the city, Zhou Wen was surprised to discover a Cube. Like the Cube on Earth, the Cube here also displayed the scene of Dubhe.</p>
<p>There’s actually a Cube here. That makes things easier. I just need to pass through the Cube and reach Dubhe before I can teleport back to Earth. Zhou Wen was first delighted before he rejected this method.</p>
<p>Through the Cube, one could indeed reach Dubhe, but to reach it in such a way, one had to clear Dubhe’s dimensional zone or they wouldn’t be able to leave.</p>
<p>This was previously verified in the Venusian dimensional zone. As long as one entered the dimensional zone through the Cube, they could only fight to the death. Unless one cleared the level, there was no chance of leaving.</p>
<p>The elder didn’t know what Zhou Wen was thinking. He led the way with his back hunched, not daring to look back at him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say a word, so he didn’t dare spout nonsense.</p>
<p>Although the city was ancient, it was filled with an artistic aura. There were many carvings on the buildings. Statues of humans and strange creatures could be seen everywhere.</p>
<p>After walking for a while, the elder took Zhou Wen to a garden. There were many flowers planted in the garden, making it look beautiful.</p>
<p>Toward the back of the garden stood two tombstones. Zhou Wen didn’t recognize the words on them. When Grim Demon saw them, he immediately shouted, “There’s no mistake about it. These fellows are the descendants of Adam and Eve. They are the tombstones of Adam and Eve.”</p>
<p>“Your Devilish Excellency, our ancestors were your friends. Unfortunately, they don’t have the mighty power of immortality like you. They can only be buried here.” As the elder spoke, he felt abnormally uneasy, unsure if his guess was right.</p>
<p>The outcome was unknown if he guessed wrongly and angered the devil king.</p>
<p>“Get out,” Zhou Wen said coldly.</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Devilish Excellency.” The elder glanced at Demonic Neonate in Zhou Wen’s arms, but he didn’t dare say a word of defiance. He retreated with his men and closed the garden’s gates.</p>
<p>“See? Those fellows are the descendants of Adam and Eve,” Grim Demon said smugly to Zhou Wen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1532'>Chapter 1532: Big Dipper Dungeon</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“Don’t you find it a little strange?” Zhou Wen said as he looked at the two tombstones.</p>
<p>“What’s so strange about it? Why can’t I tell?” Grim Demon looked around but didn’t see any problems.</p>
<p>“I don’t know the words on the tombstones. As you said, one tombstone belongs to Adam, while the other belongs to Eve. There’s nothing wrong with that, right?” Zhou Wen pointed at the tombstone.</p>
<p>“That’s right.” Grim Demon nodded.</p>
<p>“That’s strange. They are husband and wife, right? Shouldn’t husband and wife be buried together? Why are they buried in two graves with two tombstones erected?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Grim Demon wasn’t human, so he wasn’t very sensitive to this matter. However, he had seen humans being buried together in the past. It was as Zhou Wen had said, so he found it odd.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we dig up this grave and see if it’s Adam and Eve inside?” Grim Demon said as he stared at the tombstone.</p>
<p>“I’m not interested in knowing if it’s Adam and Eve inside. I just want to know how we can return to Earth.” Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to verify the existence of Adam and Eve.</p>
<p>The spatial teleportation ability of Singularity Universe couldn’t be used between the dimension and Earth.</p>
<p>If he wanted to return, other than going through the Cube, he could only return to the buffer zone between Earth’s universe and the dimension like Zhou Wen had previously done.</p>
<p>However, without Ice Maiden leading the way, Zhou Wen didn’t know how he could reach there. Even if she was there and was willing to lead the way, this wasn’t where Ice Maiden had been. It was difficult to say if he could return.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could sense that the further away he was from the sea of flowers, the greater the influence of the dimensional laws. The dimensional forces became stronger in the mountain range behind the city.</p>
<p>“Don’t ask me. It’s useless. I’ve only been to the dimension before I was born,” Grim Demon said as he spread out his hands.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, Then aren’t you spouting nonsense? Guardians are created by the dimension. When all Guardians are in their cocoon form, they come from the dimension.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was thinking about it, he suddenly felt his phone vibrate. He took it out and realized that the dungeon he was downloading had finally finished.</p>
<p>This dungeon sure took a long time to download. Zhou Wen tapped into the home screen and searched for the newly generated dungeon.</p>
<p>After searching the home screen for a while, he was surprised to discover that there was no Alcor dungeon. The new dungeon was a symbol of the Big Dipper. The name below was “Big Dipper.”</p>
<p>No way. It took so long because it was downloading the entire Big Dipper? Zhou Wen was shocked as he hurriedly opened the dungeon and allowed the blood-colored avatar to enter.</p>
<p>After entering the dungeon, Zhou Wen immediately recognized that it was the Dubhe dungeon that the Tyrannosaurus had entered.</p>
<p>Could it be that the Dubhe dimensional zone that appeared this time isn’t a single celestial body’s dimensional zone? The entire Big Dipper is a large multi-celestial-body dimensional zone? The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that it was right.</p>
<p>Having entered, Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors and the Golden Sniper. He also got Tyrant Behemoth to rush over and slam open Dubhe Palace’s door.</p>
<p>Inside the palace, there was indeed a creature that looked identical to the one in reality. It wore amethyst armor and sat inside the palace. However, it looked cartoonish in-game. It looked rather cute and didn’t give off the same vibes as in real life.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth rushed in, but Zhou Wen knew very well that Tyrant Behemoth’s present strength wasn’t enough to fight Dubhe’s creature.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Tyrant Behemoth rushed in front of the amethyst-armored creature, Zhou Wen secretly got the Golden Wyrm Scissors to fly over as well. From the palace’s entrance, he placed his finger on the sniper rifle’s trigger and shot at the amethyst-armored creature.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth led the charge and arrived in front of the amethyst armor and opened its mouth to swallow it.</p>
<p>The amethyst armor finally moved. It raised its hand and pressed down. Immediately, a terrifying purple light shot out in all directions, instantly forming an omnipresent light blast.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar standing at the door was instantly killed as the game screen dimmed.</p>
<p>This attack is a little too powerful. It’s clearly an area-of-effect attack, but the Prisoned Dragon armor on me failed to defend against it at all. I was instantly killed, Zhou Wen thought with a frown.</p>
<p>Although he had been instantly killed, Zhou Wen still obtained quite a bit of intelligence and information. This was thanks to The Disqualified.</p>
<p>From the information I obtained from dying, the power that killed the blood-colored avatar should be a high-temperature power. Furthermore, it’s accompanied by terrifying radiation. The lethality of this radiation power can’t be weaker than high-temperature heat. It might even be the main reason why the blood-colored avatar died instantly… Zhou Wen guessed as he recalled the feeling of death.</p>
<p>After studying it for a while, Zhou Wen felt that the Chaos Egg would be able to withstand that attack for a short period of time. However, it was useless blocking the attack—he needed to kill the dimensional creature.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll give it another try.” Zhou Wen dripped his blood to revive and entered the Dubhe instance dungeon again.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s surprise, he entered again. The Dubhe instance dungeon didn’t have a time limit. He could enter at any time.</p>
<p>That makes things easier. It shouldn’t be difficult to kill it after obtaining enough information from a few deaths. Zhou Wen had the Golden Wyrm Scissors in hand, so he still had a chance.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors and made it rush into the palace this time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hid inside the Chaos Egg. His current mission wasn’t to help, but to ensure that he wasn’t killed. Otherwise, once he died, it was useless no matter how powerful the Golden Wyrm Scissors was. It would vanish with him.</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrm Scissors transformed into a golden beam of light that headed for the amethyst-armored creature. The creature raised its palm again as a purple blast of light instantly filled the entire dimensional zone.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg immediately produced a large number of solid Essence Energy Crystals, nearly causing it to explode. Zhou Wen hurriedly transferred the solid Essence Energy Crystals to Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen constantly moved as solid Essence Energy Crystals were produced. Despite risking his life, the Chaos Egg remained just short of exploding.</p>
<p>After enduring for a second, the light blast weakened. Zhou Wen heaved a long sigh of relief. Just a second felt too long for him. If it continued for another second, he didn’t know if the Chaos Egg could withstand it.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>A terrifying collision sounded from the palace. At the same time, a light blast appeared again. Before Zhou Wen could figure out the situation inside, a large number of solid Essence Energy Crystals appeared in the Chaos Egg again. Zhou Wen could only crazily move them again and use Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping to feed the solid Essence Energy Crystals to Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t even have the chance to watch the battle between the two terrifying existences in the palace. All he could do was try his best to survive.. Only by surviving could the Golden Wyrm Scissors have a chance of killing the amethyst-armored creature.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1533'>Chapter 1533: Inauspicious</h3>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg exploded as there were too many solid Essence Energy Crystals that couldn’t be sent away in time.</p>
<p>The phone screen went black. The game ended, but Zhou Wen obtained quite a bit of information.</p>
<p>What left Zhou Wen most satisfied was that although the Chaos Egg exploded in-game, Tyrant Behemoth had devoured many solid Essence Energy Crystals before the Chaos Egg exploded. It was showing signs of evolving.</p>
<p>As he couldn’t find a way to leave the dimension for the time being, Zhou Wen decided to constantly grind the Dubhe instance dungeon.</p>
<p>If he could clear the Dubhe dungeon, he might be able to use the Cube to return to Earth.</p>
<p>However, to use the Cube to return to Earth, there was still a problem that needed to be resolved. Four people had to drip their blood on the Cube to use it to enter the Dubhe instance dungeon.</p>
<p>Now that Zhou Wen was alone, he had to find three others to enter with him.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen gamed, he used Truth Listener’s ability to monitor the conversations of the people in the city.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for Zhou Wen to roughly understand the situation in the city.</p>
<p>This city built on the mountain was named “Regretless City.” Grim Demon was right. After Adam and Eve were banished from the Garden of Eden, there was nowhere to go. It was Satan who gave them a way out and settled down beside Lost Paradise.</p>
<p>After generations of reproduction, only today did Regretless City reach its present scale. In fact, in the beginning, there were only a few caves.</p>
<p>Although these humans were born in the dimension, they looked no different from Earth’s humans. Even their physical flaws were the same. No one could advance to the Mythical stage with their own strength, so the strongest human in the city was only at the Epic stage.</p>
<p>For them to survive here, other than the protection of the Paradise Lost, they still needed to gather supplies for living. They were humans, not gods. They had to eat, drink, and poop every day.</p>
<p>They didn’t dare enter the Lost Paradise. Even if they entered, there was nothing to eat other than flowers.</p>
<p>Therefore, the people of Regretless City could only search for food in the mountain range. However, after entering the mountain range, the dimensional forces would become stronger. Ordinary citizens couldn’t withstand it, so they couldn’t go very far.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen learned that their food came from plants in the forest. There was something very peculiar—in the mountain range, there was a plant whose leaves couldn’t be plucked no matter how hard one tried. However, those plants couldn’t be seen at any time. One would be very lucky to occasionally chance upon them.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was studying these things, Grim Demon wasn’t idle. He kept studying the tombstone, hoping to find some clues.</p>
<p>However, the words on the tombstone didn’t reveal anything. After studying it for a long time, Grim Demon couldn’t find any problems.</p>
<p>Finally, Grim Demon made up his mind and planned on digging up Eve’s grave to take a look.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen clearly didn’t like digging up other people’s ancestral graves. Grim Demon was afraid that Zhou Wen would stop him, so he didn’t inform Zhou Wen. Taking advantage of Zhou Wen’s lack of focus, he began digging.</p>
<p>Pushing the tombstone away, he revealed the stone coffin below. Grim Demon made a prompt decision and lifted the lid of the stone coffin.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Zhou Wen was eavesdropping on the conversation between the elder and his friend when he suddenly heard Grim Demon’s cry. He hurriedly turned his head and realized that Grim Demon had opened Eve’s stone coffin.</p>
<p>At that moment, Grim Demon’s expression was somewhat complicated. He stared intently into the stone coffin as though he had seen something bizarre.</p>
<p>“What’s inside?” Zhou Wen walked to Grim Demon’s side and traced his gaze. When he saw what was inside the stone coffin, he was immediately taken aback.</p>
<p>There were no corpses in the stone coffin—not even bones. There was only one thing inside.</p>
<p>“What’s this? Why is this here?” Zhou Wen realized that there was a princess-like puppet inside the stone coffin.</p>
<p>This puppet was huge. It was almost a 1:1 live person. It wore a princess dress and was placed in the stone coffin. It looked like it was sleeping.</p>
<p>No one could answer him. Grim Demon was also at a loss. “Guardians don’t need graves. You should ask yourself. If it were you, under what circumstances would you have this thing in your grave?”</p>
<p>“Dig up Adam’s tomb and take a look,” Zhou Wen said to Grim Demon.</p>
<p>Grim Demon pushed away Adam’s tombstone and indeed, he saw the stone coffin inside.</p>
<p>When he opened the stone coffin, there was indeed a puppet inside. However, this time, it was a puppet that looked like a boy. It wore a tailcoat and looked very gentlemanly.</p>
<p>“These are clearly two puppets. There’s no skeleton inside. In other words, this can’t be Adam and Eve’s tombs,” Grim Demon said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to carefully scan the stone coffin. Apart from the two puppets, he didn’t discover anything.</p>
<p>That’s strange. If the real Adam and Eve didn’t die of old age here, where did they go? Are the people in Regretless City their descendants? Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>Grim Demon wanted to take out the two puppets to take a closer look, but no matter how hard he tried, the puppets inside remained motionless.</p>
<p>“There’s something wrong with these two puppets. With my strength, it shouldn’t be difficult for me to take them out even if they are forged from gold, much less puppets… Ah…” As Grim Demon spoke, he suddenly let out a tragic cry and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>“Grim Demon, what’s wrong?” Zhou Wen saw Grim Demon collapse beside the tombstone without moving as though he was dead. Alarmed, he didn’t dare go close. He shouted Grim Demon’s name from the side.</p>
<p>However, after shouting a few times, Grim Demon didn’t respond at all.</p>
<p>“I’ve already said that digging up graves is inauspicious. It’s very easy for something to happen, but you didn’t listen to me and insisted on digging.” Zhou Wen looked at the two puppets with an odd expression. He summoned the Golden Battle Gods and got them to restore the grave. Zhou Wen didn’t dare approach them.</p>
<p>After closing the coffin lid and pushing the grave back to its original spot, the Golden Battle Gods weren’t attacked, but Grim Demon remained motionless. It was useless no matter how Zhou Wen shouted.</p>
<p>There was no reaction even if he was electrocuted or smashed with ice. However, Grim Demon’s vitality remained. It didn’t look like he was dead.</p>
<p>After a while, Grim Demon got up in a daze.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Grim Demon asked Zhou Wen after waking up.</p>
<p>“I should be the one asking you that.” Zhou Wen recounted his sudden collapse.</p>
<p>Grim Demon’s expression turned nasty after hearing that. “How did this happen? I don’t have any memories of it happening..”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1534'>Chapter 1534: Another Samsara Stone</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“It’s best you don’t touch this thing.” Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to be nosy as he exhorted Grim Demon not to touch anything else.</p>
<p>Grim Demon also felt a lingering fear. Even if he was made to touch it again, he wouldn’t dare do so.</p>
<p>“This place should be relatively safe. Let’s stay here for the time being. Go and ask what’s on the other side of the mountain.” Zhou Wen got Grim Demon to gather information while he gamed in the cemetery.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth was close to advancing to the Calamity grade thanks to having a large number of solid Essence Energy Crystals being fed to it.</p>
<p>After Grim Demon left, Zhou Wen repeatedly grinded Dubhe Palace. Although he still couldn’t withstand the power of the purple blast of light, he gained a deeper understanding of the abilities of the amethyst-armored creature.</p>
<p>Unless the Chaos Egg can advance to the Calamity grade, it will be very difficult for it to withstand the power of the light blast. I have to think of another way. Zhou Wen was thinking of a way to kill the amethyst-armored creature in a short period of time. In that case, it didn’t matter even if the Chaos Egg couldn’t last long.</p>
<p>As he pondered, he moved solid Essence Energy crystals into Tyrant Behemoth’s mouth, but he suddenly couldn’t move anymore. Before Zhou Wen could figure out what was going on, the Chaos Egg exploded.</p>
<p>Without entering the dungeon again, Zhou Wen opened Tyrant Behemoth’s information and realized that it had indeed entered an Evolved state.</p>
<p>Without a glutton like Tyrant Behemoth to hold out and with no Companion Beast being able to digest so many Essence Energy Crystals, the Chaos Egg will only last for a shorter period of time. Tyrant Behemoth’s evolution into the Calamity grade was a good thing, but before it advanced successfully, Zhou Wen had to think of other solutions.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Demonic Neonate. She had been sleeping the entire time, looking like a normal sleeping person. There were no signs of a Companion Beast’s evolution, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t wake her up.</p>
<p>Grim Demon returned after a while. It was unknown what method he used, but he had already figured out the situation here.</p>
<p>The people from Regretless City didn’t go too far from it. Their only food was some plants on the mountain. Some had entered the mountain range, but most of them died inside. It was unknown how they died.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, there are Terror-grade creatures in the mountain range. They are only ordinary people, so they naturally can’t see Terror-grade creatures.” Grim Demon paused before continuing, “However, someone once saw a terrifying scene in the mountain range. Countless large snakes swam through the mountain. One of them was a red snake that was coiled on a mountain peak. Its body was even bigger than the mountain peak. From their description, it’s similar to the snake that Satan transformed into when he tempted Adam and Eve.”</p>
<p>“It’s not going to be easy leaving the mountain range. Even if we successfully leave, we might not be able to find a way back. Let’s stay here for the time being. When Neonate wakes up, we’ll see if she has any way of taking us back,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“We should have done that from the beginning.” Grim Demon paused before saying, “When I was reading the memories of the citizens, I discovered something. Although this place is protected by the Lost Paradise, it’s not in the Lost Paradise after all. Occasionally, dimensional creatures will come to the city and eat quite a number of people. It’s probably that snake.”</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, it’s not safe here. I hope Neonate can wake up as soon as possible.” Zhou Wen felt that Demonic Neonate likely had a way to take them back.</p>
<p>After all, the Heaven Shrouding Bell was in Demonic Neonate’s hands. Previously, Ice Maiden had used the Heaven Shrouding Bell to travel through space and reach the buffer zone between Earth’s universe and the dimension.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued gaming and grinding dungeons. Grim Demon didn’t have anyone to talk to. It almost drove him mad.</p>
<p>After less than two days, Grim Demon couldn’t help but tell Zhou Wen that he was going deep into the mountain range to scout and see if there was any other way out.</p>
<p>After Grim Demon left, Zhou Wen continued grinding dungeons every day. After killing the Golden Sniper again, he suddenly heard a chime. The sound was different from the usual dimensional crystals dropping, nor did it sound like a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Samsara Stone! When Zhou Wen saw what it was, he was immediately overjoyed.</p>
<p>After grinding for so long, this was the second Samsara Stone. He had given the previous one to the Great Might Vajra Bull. Back then, Zhou Wen didn’t know what use the Samsara Stone had and was only experimenting.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen now knew that the Samsara Stone gave unevolvable Companion Beasts an Evolvable attribute. Furthermore, their stats might be enhanced to a certain extent. They might even awaken some new skills.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had many good Companion Beasts, but because they didn’t have an Evolvable attribute, their levels couldn’t be raised. They no longer satisfied Zhou Wen’s current needs.</p>
<p>He couldn’t bear to use such rare special pets for fusion. But if he didn’t do so, they were useless, collecting dust. With the Samsara Stone, the Companion Beasts were redeemed.</p>
<p>Let me see which Companion Beast to use. Zhou Wen hoped to raise many Companion Beasts, but there was only one Samsara Stone. He had to make a choice.</p>
<p>The Death Harbinger Crow’s skill is actually very useful. If it were to use the Samsara Stone, it might be able to evolve into a powerful Companion Beast. Medusa isn’t bad either. She doesn’t seem to be of much use now, but after she evolves, her skills might become especially powerful. There’s also the Ancient Splitting Tadpole. If it can evolve to the Calamity grade, I wonder how powerful its Split Explosion ability will be… Zhou Wen sorted out his Companion Beasts and realized that there were too many Companion Beasts that needed the Samsara Stone. He was momentarily unsure.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a while before finally choosing to give the Samsara Stone to Doctor Darkness.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen actually liked Doctor Darkness’s skills very much. Furthermore, it had a soul state. It could be attached to Zhou Wen and all the skills could be used by him.</p>
<p>However, his level was too low. He couldn’t keep up with Zhou Wen’s current level and combat needs. Furthermore, he didn’t have an Evolvable attribute. Zhou Wen had always wanted to raise his level.</p>
<p>“Then let’s do Doctor Darkness.” Zhou Wen summoned Doctor Darkness and handed the Samsara Stone to him.</p>
<p>After using the Samsara Stone, Doctor Darkness’s body immediately underwent a magical change. Instead of calling it a change, it was more like molting.</p>
<p>The Mythical Doctor Darkness quickly molted and reached the starting Mortal stage.</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness, who was at the Mortal stage, looked rather adorable. He was a handsome boy who looked to be about five or six years old. He was deadpan like a robot. He wore a black robe and didn’t look like a doctor. Instead, he looked like a priest.</p>
<p>He opened Doctor Darkness’s stats and indeed, he had returned to the Mortal stage.</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness: Mortal (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Strength: 11</p>
<p>Speed: 11</p>
<p>Constitution: 11</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 11</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Scalpel, Fight Poison With Poison, Light of Penetration, Famous Killer Doctor</p>

<p>Companion Form: Soul</p>
<h3 id='chapter1535'>Chapter 1535: Companion Beast Advancement Plan</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>All the skills remain with an additional Famous Killer Doctor. I wonder what it’s used for. How can killing be related to medical skills? Zhou Wen carefully read the introduction of Famous Killer Doctor.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Famous Killer Doctor: Kill one person to save another, save one person to kill another.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared at it for a long time without understanding what the skill introduction meant.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Could it be that if I want to use Doctor Darkness to save people in the future, I have to kill someone first? Isn’t that bullshit? Zhou Wen felt that this skill was definitely not that simple.</p>
<p>He wanted to test the consequences of saving someone, but there was no one that needed Doctor Darkness’s saving. After all, Doctor Darkness mostly used Fight Poison With Poison to save others. Zhou Wen couldn’t kill someone with poison first, right?</p>
<p>With the Companion Beast in hand, it now became a problem of raising his level.</p>
<p>Previously, the Mighty Vajra Ox had returned to the Mortal stage. All he needed to do was feed it some Essence Energy Crystals and it would naturally advance. It had already returned to the Mythical stage, but to advance further was not that easy. It was unknown for the time being how it could advance to the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried feeding Doctor Darkness Essence Energy Crystals. Although it allowed Doctor Darkness to grow a little, the growth wasn’t fast. Furthermore, Doctor Darkness could only absorb a very small portion of the Essence Energy Crystals. They weren’t of much use, unlike Tyrant Behemoth which could eat them as it pleased.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, evolving Doctor Darkness with Essence Energy Crystals is unlikely. Then, what does he need to evolve? After some thought, Zhou Wen felt that he should give it a try at a poisonous place.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness’s skill was related to poison. Apart from that, Zhou Wen really couldn’t think of any other way to evolve him.</p>
<p>In the dungeons that Zhou Wen had already downloaded, there were many poisonous insects and Gu in the Valley of No Return. It was likely the most ideal place.</p>
<p>Apart from that, there was the Poison Wyrm Pool in Pool City. It was also a place of poison, so he could give it a try.</p>
<p>After some consideration, Zhou Wen chose Poison Wyrm Pool. The water in the Poison Wyrm Pool was poisonous, so he decided to test it with the poison water inside.</p>
<p>He took Doctor Darkness to Poison Wyrm Pool. Without waiting for Zhou Wen to experiment, Doctor Darkness autonomously walked to the side of Poison Wyrm Pool and took out a syringe. He drew a tube of poison water and injected it into his veins.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was soon surprised to discover that Doctor Darkness had advanced to the Legendary stage and obtained a new Life Providence. His Life Providence was the same as before—Golden Left Hand.</p>
<p>It’s so easy to evolve. If he injects a few more syringes, won’t he be able to quickly advance to the Mythical stage? However, after just injecting one tube of poison water, Doctor Darkness stopped moving.</p>
<p>The Poison Wyrm in the Poison Wyrm Pool stirred, only to be instantly killed by Zhou Wen. The previously powerful dimensional creature was too weak in front of the present Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>After confirming that Doctor Darkness no longer needed the poison water here, Zhou Wen had no choice but to take him to other dungeons.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen circled Zhuolu, the Valley of No Return, and other dungeons with poison. Every time Doctor Darkness saw a new poison, he would directly extract it and inject it into himself.</p>
<p>He seemed to have a physique that was invulnerable to all poisons, or perhaps even stronger. Others were immune to all poisons, but Doctor Darkness could use poison to strengthen his body.</p>
<p>Some poisons could allow Doctor Darkness to evolve, while others didn’t have much of a reaction. Furthermore, at a low level, any random poison could advance his level. Towards the end, it required him to inject several types of poisons to advance.</p>
<p>After lots of hard work, Doctor Darkness finally returned to the Mythical stage. His Life Soul and Wheel of Destiny were the same as before.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried a few more poisons, but none of them allowed Doctor Darkness to continue evolving. He temporarily failed to find any new poisons and couldn’t continue experimenting.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, ordinary poison shouldn’t be able to evolve Doctor Darkness to the Terror grade. I have to find some powerful poison-type creatures and use their poison to evolve Doctor Darkness. Zhou Wen felt that if he could find a Calamity-grade poison-type creature, he should be able to advance Doctor Darkness to the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Where can I find a poison-type Calamity creature? Zhou Wen immediately thought of the one in the Zhuolu Sapphire Sky. However, that dimensional creature had been inside the Sapphire Sky the entire time. It wasn’t easy to kill, and he didn’t know if it was considered poison-type.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ran through all the dungeons again, but he failed to find a suitable candidate.</p>
<p>Taking this opportunity, Zhou Wen picked his Companion Beasts again. As low-level Companion Beasts weren’t of much use, a number could be used as supplementary materials for fusion.</p>
<p>As for those that were very special which Zhou Wen found useful and was unwilling to fuse, he had to think of a way to raise them. It was best if they could be raised to the Calamity grade, or at worst, the Terror grade. Otherwise, they would be useless in battle at this stage.</p>
<p>I have to think of a way to raise Doctor Darkness. The Evil Spirit King has recently absorbed quite a number of Terror-grade creatures. It should be advancing to the Terror grade soon… Banana Fairy has to advance further… Should I raise the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul again… Zhou Wen listed out the few Companion Beasts he thought highly of and immediately felt a headache. There were too many Companion Beasts that needed to be upgraded. Each of them had their own unique traits and he couldn’t bear to use any of them as materials.</p>
<p>What left Zhou Wen most conflicted was the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. This Companion Beast was really strong, but his Jinxes Master skill couldn’t be removed. Zhou Wen was somewhat afraid.</p>
<p>With the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General and Bamboo Blade which jinxed their master, Zhou Wen was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to withstand them if they advanced to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>However, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was really useful, especially in the stellar dungeon. To the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, it was practically a home-ground battle.</p>
<p>In the past, there were definitely many stellar dimensional zones. It was a waste not to use the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>I’ll try raising it again. The Bamboo Blade’s Jinxes Master ability is even stronger than the Tiger Soul General. There shouldn’t be any problems. Zhou Wen hesitated for a while before deciding to raise the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General again.</p>
<p>Some dimensional zones did require the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to lead the charge.</p>
<p>Of course, the main reason was that it was very difficult for other Companion Beasts to advance. Even if Zhou Wen wanted them to advance, it wasn’t something that could be done immediately.</p>
<p>However, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was different. If he used it for fusion, it wouldn’t be lost no matter how low the chances were. In other words, as long as he fused with a Terror-grade Companion Beast, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General had a chance of advancing to the Terror grade. By fusing with a Calamity-grade Companion Beast, the Tiger Soul General could quickly reach the Calamity grade. This ability was not something other Companion Beasts possessed.</p>
<p>Bamboo Blade also had the Jinxes Master attribute; Zhou Wen still didn’t know if it had such an ability.</p>
<p>Calamity-grade Companion Beasts were still useful. Zhou Wen couldn’t bear to fuse them. All he could do was use Terror-grade Companion Beasts to raise the Tiger Soul General to the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Which one should I use? Zhou Wen looked at all the Terror-grade Companion Beasts he had.</p>
<p>The most worthless Terror-grade Companion Beast was the Golden Battle God, but the Golden Battle God’s skills had no synergy with the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1536'>Chapter 1536: New Tiger Soul General</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have many Terror-grade Companion Beasts. The Golden Battle God dropped most easily. The other Terror-grade Companion Beasts were relatively rare.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t bear to fuse Companion Beasts like Grim Reaper No. 10, Limitless Demon Dragon King, Prisoned Dragon, and Banana Fairy. The remaining Golden Battle Gods, Flaming Monarch, and so on didn’t seem to be a good fit for Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>After some choosing, he didn’t find a suitable Terror-grade Companion Beast to fuse with the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>In terms of skill compatibility, Grim Reaper No. 10 and Prisoned Dragon are more compatible with the Tiger Soul General, but these two Companion Beasts have something special about them. It would be a waste to use them as fusion material. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and couldn’t bear to part with them. Finally, he decided to try with a Golden Battle God first.</p>
<p>At most, he would be swapping for some skills that weren’t compatible with the Tiger Soul General. This was unlikely to affect him much as long as he could advance the Tiger Soul General to the Terror grade.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate any further. He placed the Tiger Soul General in the fusion column and placed a Golden Battle God as material before clicking on ‘Fuse.’</p>
<p>With a flash of light, the Golden Battle God in the material column vanished. As for the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, something amazing was about to happen.</p>
<p>The purple-armored Tiger Soul General’s armor had turned into a purple metal-like texture. The armor’s envelopment of the Tiger Soul General and mount was even more complete. It looked like a heavy-armored Metal Knight.</p>
<p>These were only minute changes that were not much different from before. The biggest change was the spear in Tiger Soul General’s hand.</p>
<p>He was originally holding a spear and although it was still a spear, it was no longer in an ancient style. It had become a spear with a very modern feel to it. Its design was very exaggerated.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t describe what the spear looked like, but it looked really beautiful. The spearhead was three-dimensional and wider. It didn’t look like an ancient spear. There were some holes on it, but he didn’t know what they were for.</p>
<p>Its appearance wasn’t important. Zhou Wen only wanted to know if the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General had advanced to the Terror grade or if its skills had been wiped out.</p>
<p>Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General: Terror (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Malicious Evil</p>
<p>Life Soul: Tiger Soul Runes</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Ferocious and Evil</p>
<p>Terror Form: Devil Knight (S-grade)</p>
<p>Strength: 82</p>
<p>Speed: 82</p>
<p>Constitution: 82</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 82</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Tempered Steel Cauldron, Rampage, Magic Stone Curse, One with Horse, Penetrating Pierce, Evil Deeds Everywhere, Badlands, Jinxes Master, Crazy Sweep.</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>After reading the information on the Fiend-Armored Tiger Ghost General, Zhou Wen was immediately overjoyed. Indeed, he had advanced to the Terror grade. Furthermore, his skills hadn’t been wiped out with the addition of Crazy Sweep.</p>
<p>The Tiger Soul General used an ancient spear, not a modern firearm. Crazy Sweep was probably a useless skill that was not usable by Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>This was the best outcome Zhou Wen could think of. Having another useless skill was better than having one less skill.</p>
<p>I’ll give it a try and see what the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General looks like after he transforms into his Terror form. Zhou Wen chose to enter the Yang City dungeon before summoning the Tiger Soul General and having him transform into his Terror form.</p>
<p>At the instant the Tiger Soul General descended, Zhou Wen felt that he wasn’t gaming, but watching a science fiction movie.</p>
<p>The Tiger Soul General and mount, who were completely wrapped in heavy metal armor, were like mechanical knights in a sci-fi movie. The armor was dark purple, and there was a purple glow at the gaps akin to having purple light outline the curves of the armor.</p>
<p>The Tiger Soul General’s body was still burning with purple demonic flames. The spear in its hand also had billowing purple flames, especially the spearhead. Purple light spewed out from the hole in an extremely technological manner.</p>
<p>“It looks pretty good, but I wonder how your actual combat strength is. Let me see your abilities. Attack with all your might.” Zhou Wen ordered the Tiger Soul General to attack the blood bone temples.</p>
<p>The eyes of the Tiger Soul General and mount lit up at the same time as they shimmered with a shocking purple flame. In the next second, the Tiger Soul General raised the spear in his hand.</p>
<p>What happened next left Zhou Wen dumbfounded. Purple bullets spewed out from the hole in the spear like a storm.</p>
<p>Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!</p>
<p>This commotion was similar to the effect of a Gatling gun, but the might of the purple bullets was much more powerful.</p>
<p>After a series of explosions, bullet holes appeared on the walls and doors of many blood bone temples. Blood Spirits rushed out of the blood bone temples and angrily lunged at the Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>The Tiger Soul General continued his sweep with his spear, blasting apart many Blood Spirits that were charging at him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s mouth gaped open. After a while, he snapped to his senses and muttered in surprise, “Holy sh*t, has the Tiger Soul General actually become a mecha knight?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen soon realized that his thoughts were too simple and naive.</p>
<p>When a Blood Spirit rushed close to the Tiger Soul General, the Tiger Soul General used the spear to stab the Blood Spirit’s chest, raising it into the sky.</p>
<p>It sounded contradictory, but in fact, it was true. Not only could the spear be used as a modern-day weapon, but it could also be used as an ancient spear.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched the Tiger Soul General’s performance from the side. The spear in his hand went from being brandished wildly to raining hell. It stormed a path through the horde of Blood Spirits.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there were no flames here to augment the Tiger Soul General. Otherwise, he would have been even stronger.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Haha, the fusion this time was perfect. The Tiger Soul General can now engage in melee and long-range attacks. Furthermore, it can sweep across a large area. It’s perfect. Zhou Wen was excited.</p>
<p>The Tiger Soul General became stronger the more he fought. The interior of the metal armor seemed to be a huge furnace with the flames inside burning brighter and brighter. The Tiger Soul General also became stronger. No matter how many Blood Spirits appeared, they were mercilessly killed by the Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>When the Tiger Soul General rushed to Kui who let out a thunderous roar, the Tiger Soul General managed to bear the brunt of the sonar attack and arrive in front of Kui. He fought it crazily without being at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Amazing. This is only the result of constant combat. If he can fight in flames, he should be even stronger. Zhou Wen had the urge to immediately take the Tiger Soul General to a fire-elemental instance dungeon for testing.</p>
<p>The Tiger Soul General became stronger the more he fought, but Kui didn’t have such an ability. It gradually became at a disadvantage. After more than two hours, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General used its Terror-grade body to damage the Calamity-grade Kui until it was covered in wounds and on its last breath. It eventually died from the torturous attacks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, only a Speed Crystal dropped. Zhou Wen fed it to his Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Should I take the Tiger Soul General to the Dubhe instance dungeon to give it a try? Although Zhou Wen felt that the Tiger Soul General shouldn’t be able to withstand the light blast, dying in-game wasn’t a loss.. He could give it a shot.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1537'>Chapter 1537: Returning to the Hut</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if the light blast used by the Calamity creature on Dubhe was considered a high-temperature power that the Tiger Soul General could accept. Logically speaking, it was a power similar to high-temperature radiation. It should be within the range of the Tiger Soul General’s absorption.</p>
<p>If the Tiger Soul General couldn’t absorb and convert that power for its own use, it would probably die instantly if it relied on its own strength.</p>
<p>After all, even the Prisoned Dragon armor with Absolute Defense couldn’t withstand it for long. Although the Tiger Soul General’s defense was very strong, it was still inferior to Prisoned Dragon’s Absolute Defense.</p>
<p>After launching the Dubhe dungeon, Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors as per his previous plan. He used the Chaos Egg as protection and wore the Prisoned Dragon armor. It allowed him to last a little longer when the Chaos Egg exploded.</p>
<p>The difference this time was that the Tiger Soul General was standing beside Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The moment the door opened, the Golden Wyrm Scissors charged at the amethyst-armored creature. The amethyst-armored creature didn’t hesitate to release an omnipresent, sun-like light blast.</p>
<p>I hope the Tiger Soul General can hold on for a little longer. Zhou Wen didn’t have extravagant hopes of the Tiger Soul General lasting as long as the Chaos Egg; he just didn’t want him to be instantly killed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept sensing the Tiger Soul General to see when he would be killed by the light blast, but to his surprise, the Tiger Soul General wasn’t killed despite Zhou Wen waiting for quite some time.</p>
<p>Instead, it was Zhou Wen himself. Without Tyrant Behemoth as a trash can for his transferred solid crystals, the Chaos Egg lasted for a much shorter period of time.</p>
<p>The Tiger Soul General remained alive when the Chaos Egg was destroyed and the game screen went black.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the Tiger Soul General can also absorb the power of the amethyst-armored creature’s light blast and use it for himself. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to last so long. Zhou Wen was delighted and alarmed.</p>
<p>For the Tiger Soul General to last so long, he must have become very strong. Zhou Wen didn’t know the limits of the Tiger Soul General’s strength. If he could become stronger without end, it would be terrifying. Perhaps he could defy the heavens and kill Dubhe’s dimensional creature.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Of course, this was only Zhou Wen’s beautiful wish. In fact, any skill had its limits. It was impossible for Tiger Soul General to become stronger indefinitely. His body couldn’t withstand such terrifying power.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t even have the chance to give it a shot and try his luck. This was because he couldn’t last until the Tiger Soul General became stronger. Once Zhou Wen died, the game would end, depriving the chance for Tiger Soul General to become that strong.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly realized that he was the one who was the greatest burden.</p>
<p>No, I have to think of a way to live a little longer. It’s fine if I can’t fight, but I can’t even protect myself. That makes me a little too useless. Zhou Wen thought hard, hoping to become stronger.</p>
<p>“It’s impossible to last that long with just the Chaos Egg. Even when Tyrant Behemoth was still around, it only lasted a little longer. It doesn’t mean much. I have to last longer,” Zhou Wen muttered to himself.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>The best solution he could think of was to advance the Chaos Egg to the Calamity grade, but this was the dimension. Ignoring finding a suitable dimensional zone, there were no dimensional zones here.</p>
<p>I can’t return now. What should I do? As Zhou Wen thought about it, his eyes suddenly lit up. I wonder if I can use the dungeon’s power to advance to the Calamity grade in-game?</p>
<p>He tried it the moment he thought of it, but Zhou Wen didn’t know which of the dungeons he had downloaded could be used to advance to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen didn’t know if the game dungeons would work. All he could do was slowly experiment.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought of the game dungeons he had which corresponded to the Essence Energy Arts he cultivated. If there was a similar type, Zhou Wen would try his luck.</p>
<p>The First Order of Chaos is an Essence Energy Art from the West, but I haven’t downloaded many Western game dungeons. None of them seem to be compatible with it. If I had known this would happen, I would have downloaded more dungeons from the West District… Zhou Wen regretted it too late.</p>
<p>Wait… Zhou Wen suddenly thought of a dimensional zone. It was Sweetie’s Hut—the Time Hut.</p>
<p>There were four rooms—Past, Present, Future, and Chaos. Zhou Wen wondered if the latter had anything to do with the First Order of Chaos since it had the name ‘Chaos.’</p>
<p>However, Sweetie is God. The Time Hut is a dimensional zone under God. The First Order of Chaos is an Essence Energy Art from Zeus’s pantheon. The two aren’t of the same type. I wonder if they can be used together. Zhou Wen decided to try his luck.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen had already used the Chaos Egg to enter the Time Hut a long time ago. Only the Chaos Egg could withstand the temporal powers of the Time Hut.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen hadn’t thought in that direction back then, so he hadn’t paid attention.</p>
<p>Once again, he entered the Time Hut under the Chaos Egg’s protection. Nothing here had changed much. Zhou Wen didn’t dare enter the Past Hut or the Future Hut.</p>
<p>He went to the Chaos Hut to take a look, but he didn’t find anything.</p>
<p>There weren’t many things in the room to begin with. Zhou Wen touched them all, but he didn’t sense any abnormal changes.</p>
<p>Is the power of the Chaos Hut incompatible with the First Order of Chaos, or can I not just advance to the Calamity grade in-game? Zhou Wen couldn’t be sure of the possibilities.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was somewhat unwilling to return just like that.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen decided to visit the Future Hut again.</p>
<p>The Past Hut allowed him to return to the past, and the Future Hut likely sent him to the future. However, the Future Hut was an empty void.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had always been brooding over this matter. He didn’t know what it meant.</p>
<p>If that was the future of humanity, wouldn’t it mean that humanity would perish in the future?</p>
<p>Now that Zhou Wen was much stronger than before, he wanted to enter again to take a look. Perhaps he could see something.</p>
<p>When he entered the Future Hut again, the scene Zhou Wen saw was the same as before. The phone screen was pitch-black as though it had been switched off.</p>
<p>Due to his experience, Zhou Wen directly activated the Ancient Sovereign Sutra and used Human Sovereign’s power to illuminate his surroundings.</p>
<p>The Ancient Sovereign Sutra was already at the Calamity grade, so its energy was much stronger than before. In the past, Zhou Wen could only illuminate a very small area, but now, he could illuminate dozens of meters.</p>
<p>However, light couldn’t fully illuminate the Future Hut. What truly illuminated the darkness was the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s potent vitality.</p>
<p>The moment his surroundings were illuminated, Zhou Wen carefully observed them. The scene he saw delighted him.</p>
<p>This was because Zhou Wen realized that this wasn’t a completely empty world.. Beneath him were some objects, but Zhou Wen was momentarily unable to tell what was below.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1538'>Chapter 1538: Fire-Armored God</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>As the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s lighting range was limited, and the things below were too large, the area he could see was only a portion of it.</p>
<p>Just like blind people touching an elephant, based on what he saw, Zhou Wen was unable to determine what it was.</p>
<p>What he could see was an uneven stone platform. It was pockmarked as though it had been bombed by a bomber.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was just about to land and get closer to the stone and see where he was when he realized that the stone platform below had moved before he did.</p>
<p>The stone platform was slowly spinning. Clearly, it wasn’t land. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have spun.</p>
<p>As the stone spun, Zhou Wen gradually saw some signs of artificial carving. He realized that it looked like a huge statue.</p>
<p>However, the parts he could see were limited. He didn’t know what the carving was.</p>
<p>When most of the stone spun to the other side, Zhou Wen was surprised to discover that it was a statue of a Buddha.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t unfamiliar with the Buddha statue. It was the biggest Buddha statue in Dragon Gate Grotto. Zhou Wen had often been to Dragon Gate Grotto, so he was naturally familiar with it.</p>
<p>However, half of the Buddha statue’s body had blasted away.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Buddha statue was floating in the void.</p>
<p>How did this happen? Why did this Buddha statue become like this? Who shattered half of it? Is Dragon Gate Grotto still around? Zhou Wen was alarmed. If this was the future of the world, wouldn’t it mean that Luoyang was doomed?</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, the phone screen suddenly turned black. Zhou Wen imagined that the Human Sovereign Sutra had failed. After checking, he realized that the blood-colored avatar had died. He didn’t even know how it had died. Zhou Wen could only smile bitterly to himself.</p>
<p>Past, Present, Future, Chaos, First Order of Chaos… Will there be a connection between these? As Zhou Wen thought about it, his eyes suddenly lit up.</p>
<p>Right, the First Order of Chaos is Chaos’s Essence Energy Art. Chaos’s status in that Mythical system is probably similar to the egg that trapped Pangu. If I treat it as Chaos, then Chaos has no concept of time and space. There shouldn’t be a past, present, or future… Zhou Wen kept thinking.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was in Regretless City, Earth wasn’t very calm.</p>
<p>Some creatures appeared on the Cube again. No matter how one looked at them, these creatures looked like Earth’s dinosaurs. Some looked like tyrannosaurus rexes and some looked like triceratops or pterosaurs.</p>
<p>These creatures wanted to enter the Dubhe dimensional zone, but without exception, they were killed by the amethyst-armored creature. Even though they knew that the difference in strength was huge, some creatures still rushed in from time to time.</p>
<p>Although none of these creatures suspected to be dinosaurs cleared the level, their appearance and strength became a hot topic.</p>
<p>“Do you think those dinosaur-like fellows came from Earth?”</p>
<p>“I heard that the dinosaurs’ extinction is very bizarre. Don’t tell me they chose to leave Earth and develop in the universe?”</p>
<p>“That’s really hard to say. Anyway, I find it strange why the dinosaurs went completely extinct. Not even one survived. From the perspective of probabilities, it doesn’t make sense.”</p>
<p>“If those dinosaurs really came from Earth, aren’t they a little too strong?”</p>
<p>“Dinosaurs have extremely powerful bodies to begin with…”</p>
<p>Whether or not dinosaur-like creatures had left Earth, the various media outlets expressed their views. The ordinary citizens also had their own views.</p>
<p>However, no matter what kind of dinosaur it was, they ultimately died in the dungeon. There were no exceptions.</p>
<p>As people discussed, the Cube’s screen lit up again. Other creatures were challenging the Dubhe dimensional zone.</p>
<p>The challengers were surprisingly not dinosaurs.</p>
<p>They were creatures suspected to be human. Their entire bodies were covered in armor, preventing anyone from seeing what was inside.</p>
<p>The black armor looked like it was made of raw metal, but there was nothing special about it.</p>
<p>Just like the tyrannosaurus from before, the armor-clad creatures arrived outside Dubhe’s palace. They pushed open the door and walked over.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The amethyst-armored creature in the palace erupted with the purple flames that Zhou Wen was more familiar with.</p>
<p>Unlike the dinosaurs, the creatures that came this time weren’t instantly killed. Amidst the terrifying purple blast, they walked towards the amethyst-armored creature.</p>
<p>People quickly realized that the challengers weren’t here to kill the amethyst-armored creature, but to circle around it and reach the back of the palace.</p>
<p>There was a teleportation nexus there. The creatures stood on the teleportation nexus before disappearing. The Cube’s screen switched to the ranking interface. A name appeared in first place.</p>
<p>“Fire-Armored God.” Zhang Chunqiu softly repeated the word as he frowned, as though he was thinking about something difficult.</p>
<p>After this battle, people realized that if they wanted to pass through the palace and reach the teleportation nexus, they could do so without killing the amethyst-armored creature inside.</p>
<p>Even so, no one dared to give it a try. The light blast produced by the amethyst-armored creature was just too powerful. It wasn’t that simple to bypass it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was studying how to kill the amethyst-armored creature and wasn’t in the mood to look at the Cube. Therefore, he didn’t know that clearing the level didn’t require killing the amethyst-armored creature.</p>
<p>After Fire-Armored God entered the rankings, the various families began a new round of tests. It was impossible for humans to kill the amethyst creature, but it didn’t seem impossible as long as they made a run for it.</p>
<p>Everyone was searching for a way to withstand the light blast. The price of light and fire-elemental defensive Companion Beasts increased several times overnight. However, it was limited to high-level Companion Beasts. Low-level ones were useless.</p>
<p>Some powerful factions began deliberately heading to fire-elemental dimensional zones to hunt dimensional creatures. Some people also thought of Sovereign Sui’s Tomb, but when they arrived, they realized that it had vanished.</p>
<p>While others were desperately searching for fire-elemental Companion Beasts, Zhou Wen’s body was undergoing a strange change.</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhou Wen was standing in front of Sweetie’s hut. He hadn’t entered it. The First Order of Chaos circulated in his body, and his hand was pressing down on the wooden tablet with the words “Sweetie’s Hut.”</p>
<p>As the First Order of Chaos circulated, the words on the wooden tablet slowly vanished as though they had been sucked away by some force.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen studied the First Order of Chaos, he realized that the power of the Time Hut didn’t come from the hut itself, but from these words.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1539'>Chapter 1539: Heaven-Opening Words</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>What are these words?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been considering this question the entire time. All this time, he had been observing the Time Hut, but nothing in the hut was abnormal enough to cause a reaction from the First Order of Chaos. Only the words on the hut were somewhat special.</p>
<p>Sweetie’s Hut, Past, Present, Future, and Chaos—why do these words have a special power? What is the foundation of this power? Why is this power related to the First Order of Chaos?</p>
<p>In the beginning, there was only Chaos, and it drew the curtains to all things. What is the First Order?</p>
<p>While pondering over this problem, Zhou Wen checked some explanations regarding the words on the Internet. Typical resources stipulated that text were symbols.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>This explanation was naturally correct, but when one thought about it deeper, words were actually a set of coordinates. A single text represented a set of coordinates. Two words were like the latitude and longitude of Earth, so it could more accurately define a set of coordinates.</p>
<p>Three words might be the length, breadth, and height of a three-dimensional world. They gave a more precise positioning.</p>
<p>The more words there were, the more precise the coordinates would be. The spatial dimensions they represented might also be higher.</p>
<p>Words were very magical. Originally, no one knew what the things in this world were. Everything was chaotic and unknown. Only with text could people come to a common agreement on what something was.</p>
<p>The use of words was to give all things—things that could and couldn’t be seen—a coordinate defined by humans. As long as one said the coordinates, anyone who knew the word would know what it was.</p>
<p>This was equivalent to giving the chaotic world order. The world itself didn’t need order because existence was order in itself. Humans needed order. Humans were the ones who discovered order, and words were the best carrier for human-established order.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen comprehended this and touched the engraved wooden plaques, the First Order of Chaos automatically circulated.</p>
<p>The words on the wooden tablet transformed into a strange force that flowed into his body and fused with the First Order of Chaos, causing it to undergo a shocking transformation.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen absorbed the words—Past, Present, and Future—he vaguely felt that the First Order of Chaos had reached the edge of Calamity transformation, but it was still lacking that final step.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen went to the door and attempted to absorb the words “Sweetie’s Hut.” However, the words also had magical powers.</p>
<p>It left Zhou Wen somewhat puzzled. The power of the words “past, present, and future” clearly had traces of time and space. However, the power transmitted by Sweetie’s Hut didn’t seem to have much to do with time and space.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was wondering what was going on, the Chaos Egg appeared and enveloped the blood-colored avatar’s body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and the blood-colored avatar were one. Everything the blood-colored avatar felt was happening to Zhou Wen himself. At that moment, he could clearly sense that the blood-colored avatar’s body was undergoing a strange change.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg in the past was a form of protection for Zhou Wen. It was a breeding ground for nutrition.</p>
<p>However, as the blood-colored avatar’s body changed, Zhou Wen felt that the Chaos Egg had become an obstacle. Or rather, a shackle that bound his body, making him feel abnormally uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It was like a person being locked in a cramped closet for an entire night. He needed to curl up his entire body into a ball and have his knees pressed against his chest to squeeze in.</p>
<p>After a night of torture, what this person wanted the most was to leave.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt the same way. Now, he had the urge to break through the Chaos Egg and rush out to take a breath of fresh air. He felt extremely uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Pangu split the heavens and earth apart to allow all things to live. Could it be that this Chaos Egg can only form the Calamity Zone through its destruction? The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that it was right.</p>
<p>Therefore, he gathered his strength, hoping to break through the Chaos Egg’s restraints.</p>
<p>However, only now did Zhou Wen clearly realize how terrifying the Chaos Egg’s defense was.</p>
<p>His physical strength and Essence Energy were already comparable to a Human Realm creature, but when such power struck the Chaos Egg, it hardly left a scuff, much less break it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen unleashed his Essence Energy again and again to strike the Chaos Egg, but he failed to shatter it.</p>
<p>Why are you so tenacious? Aren’t you giving me trouble? Zhou Wen didn’t seem to realize that if it wasn’t for the Chaos Egg’s powerful defense, he would have been dead several times over.</p>
<p>However, the advantage of the Chaos Egg now became his greatest obstacle. Zhou Wen had liked the Chaos Egg’s defense in the past, but now, it was tormenting.</p>
<p>He kept at it, be it ten times, hundred times, a thousand times, or even ten thousand times, but despite Zhou Wen not giving up, the Chaos Egg had no intention of shattering.</p>
<p>Ignoring the shattering of the Chaos Egg, he couldn’t even scrape the Chaos Egg’s membrane.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew very well that persistence was very important, but sometimes, persistence needed brains.</p>
<p>How can I break the Chaos Egg? I’m not the real Pangu. Even if I were Pangu, I don’t have that ax that split the heavens and earth apart. Wait… Where did Pangu’s ax come from? Nothing had been born amidst the Chaos, so there shouldn’t be the concept of an ax. The so-called Pangu Ax might not be an ax. Perhaps myths and legends have objectified some kind of power. Then, what’s the power that can split the heavens and earth? Zhou Wen thought about it. He wasn’t willing to aimlessly do something futile.</p>
<p>Since words are a carrier of human order, when words give the originally unknown world a definition, it’s equivalent to splitting apart the heavens and earth… The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more convinced he was.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t wrong. The fault was that he was from the East District. The culture he was familiar with was a little different from the West District’s Chaos mythology.</p>
<p>It couldn’t be said to be wrong. It was just that his understanding was somewhat different, so the direction he took was somewhat different.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg should have advanced to the Calamity grade in another way, but Zhou Wen had taken a completely different path. The West District’s Essence Energy Art had been imbued with the culture and spirit of the East District. Even the founder of the First Order of Chaos probably never expected the First Order of Chaos to be comprehended in such a manner.</p>
<p>Above the Chaos Egg, shimmering words gradually appeared. Stroke by stroke, shimmering words—mountains, rivers, wind, fire, sun, moon, and stars—appeared, and a portion of the Chaos Egg disintegrated and melted.</p>
<p>The words vanished with the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>When the final Chaos Egg shard melted, the blood-colored avatar’s body was liberated. In the next second, the blood-colored avatar’s body lit up as countless words spewed out from his body like a data stream.. They spun around his body like blocks, forming the appearance of a Chaos Egg that enveloped Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1540'>Chapter 1540: Chaos’s First Order</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>It’s done! Zhou Wen looked at the Chaos Egg around him. Although it still looked the same as before, it was completely different.</p>
<p>The previous Chaos Egg was a Chaos Egg, and the present Chaos Egg was Zhou Wen’s Calamity Zone.</p>
<p>However, to Zhou Wen’s dismay, this Calamity Zone was a little too small. Just like the Chaos Egg in the past, it could only accommodate him.</p>
<p>Taking out his phone, he took a look at his stats and realized that the First Order of Chaos had indeed reached the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Calamity Zone: Chaos’s First Order</p>
<p>Zhou Wen recognized these words, but he didn’t understand what the ability of the First Order of Chaos Calamity Zone, which had the same name as the Essence Energy Art, was.</p>
<p>I’ll give it a try. Zhou Wen activated the Big Dipper instance dungeon and entered Dubhe’s palace.</p>
<p>Chaos’s First Order was quite interesting. It was equivalent to the Chaos Egg, so using it was equivalent to the summoning of the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>It looked no different from when it was at the Terror grade. It was still the same Chaos Egg that enveloped his body. He couldn’t tell that the Chaos Egg was made of words.</p>
<p>Ignoring everything else, its defense should be much stronger, right? Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors and the Tiger Soul General and got them to slam open Dubhe Palace’s door.</p>
<p>After the Golden Wyrm Scissors charged at the amethyst-armored creature, a terrifying purple light blast appeared.</p>
<p>When the Chaos Egg was struck by the light blast, many solid Essence Energy Crystals immediately appeared. Just like before, they quickly piled up inside the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>This is no different from before! Zhou Wen was depressed. He only hoped that the Chaos Egg was more resilient than before and wouldn’t explode so quickly.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen was certain that the Chaos Egg was indeed much tougher than before after being strengthened by the Calamity Zone. The solid crystals inside nearly filled the Chaos Egg, but it didn’t explode.</p>
<p>Although the Chaos Egg didn’t explode, Zhou Wen’s body couldn’t take it. His body was almost flattened from the solid crystals’ squeezing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hadn’t thought of this problem previously, but now, he suddenly realized that the toughness of the Chaos Egg was useless. His body couldn’t withstand such pressure. If the solid Essence Energy Crystals continued to increase, he would definitely be squeezed to death.</p>
<p>I’m afraid I’m the first person in this world to be squeezed to death by Essence Energy Crystals, right? People clamor amidst tears, hoping to obtain some high-level Essence Energy Crystals, but I’m squeezed to death because of having too many. This is ridiculous… If only this could be like the real world, allowing me to exchange the Essence Energy Crystals for vouchers. A single voucher is equivalent to thousands of Essence Energy Crystals… Unfortunately, Essence Energy Crystals aren’t money, nor are they vouchers. They can’t be stacked. Just as Zhou Wen was thinking, he suddenly saw the Chaos Egg light up. A word lit up inside the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>It was the word “one.” When the word lit up, Zhou Wen realized that a word had appeared in all the crystals.</p>
<p>This is something! If there’s one, there will be two and three. Could it be… With a thought, Zhou Wen immediately saw a few words light up inside the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand… The words that represented numbers lit up.</p>
<p>Every time a number lit up, the Essence Energy Crystals in the Chaos Egg would change.</p>
<p>When the number in the Essence Energy Crystals turned to two, the Essence Energy Crystals in the Chaos Egg suddenly decreased by half, leaving plenty of space.</p>
<p>When it became three, there were fewer Essence Energy Crystals. The bigger the number in the Essence Energy Crystals, the fewer crystals there were.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, I can really stack numbers like money! Zhou Wen was immediately excited. He picked up a crystal that had the word ‘thousand’ on it and immediately felt that the Essence Energy contained in the crystal was as terrifying as the energy in a nuclear reactor. Clearly, the Essence Energy contained in this crystal was very likely equivalent to a thousand crystals.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, surely I don’t have to worry about the Chaos Egg exploding? After all, it can be stacked constantly. Even if there are 100 million Essence Energy Crystals, they can be stacked into one. Zhou Wen felt that everything was worth it.</p>
<p>However, he soon realized that his idea was nice, perhaps too good to be true. The number in the Chaos Egg only reached ten thousand, but there weren’t any words like billion.</p>
<p>The Essence Energy Crystals ultimately stacked to ten thousand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen attempted to activate the other words, but it was useless. Apart from the words that represented numbers, the other words couldn’t be activated.</p>
<p>However, even so, it was already of great boon to Zhou Wen. Just the amount of space saved from stacking ten thousand Essence Energy Crystals together was enough to help him greatly. It prevented him from being squeezed to death by them.</p>
<p>As such, Zhou Wen realized that he could easily withstand the damage of the light blast with the help of the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sized up the situation outside while inside the Chaos Egg. All he could see was a dazzling purple light—nothing else. All he could sense was that the Golden Wyrm Scissors was fighting the amethyst-armored creature inside.</p>
<p>Occasionally, he could see golden beams flash in the purple light. It was likely the radiance of the Golden Wyrm Scissors.</p>
<p>As for the Tiger Soul General by the side, his aura became stronger and stronger. He had already roughly reached the Calamity grade and was constantly becoming stronger.</p>
<p>I should be able to know the limits of the Tiger Soul General this time, right? Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>After a while, Zhou Wen realized that he could see a purple flame plume where the Tiger Soul General was. The purple color was somewhat different from the purple color of the light blast.</p>
<p>As the flames became stronger, he could already tell that it was the outline of the Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>Such power should already be stronger than the power of the light blast, right? That’s why the flames can be seen. Is the Tiger Soul General really that strong? It’s only at the Terror grade, but it can withstand the power of a Calamity-grade creature? Furthermore, it’s not an ordinary Calamity-grade creature. With a thought, Zhou Wen ordered the Tiger Soul General to help attack the amethyst armor.</p>
<p>The Tiger Soul General charged forward without any hesitation, but due to the intense battle energy fluctuations inside, he couldn’t hear the exact situation even with Truth Listener’s power.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>After a loud bang, Zhou Wen sensed Tiger Soul General’s body fly out and slam into the ground. It tore the ground into the distance and slammed into something before stopping.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, the Tiger Soul General got up and charged in again.</p>
<p>Again and again, every time the Tiger Soul General was thrown out, he would quickly rush back in. As for Zhou Wen, he could clearly sense that the Tiger Soul General’s aura was getting stronger.</p>
<p>The Tiger Soul General is quite an oddity. He’s clearly only at the Terror grade and doesn’t even have a Calamity Zone, but he can rely on the combination of various skills to resist a powerful Calamity creature… Zhou Wen felt that he needed to pay attention to the problem of skills.. If there was a chance, he should learn more useful skills.</p>
<p>3</p>
<h3 id='chapter1541'>Chapter 1541: Wolf Kiss</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>With the sound of scissors opening and closing, Zhou Wen saw the light blast in the palace suddenly vanish as the world in front of him became clearer.</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrm Scissors stood there, levitating in the hall. The Tiger Soul General with armor that resembled burning crystals also stood in the hall. As for the amethyst-armored creature, it had already collapsed. Its head and body had been separated.</p>
<p>His body quickly dissipated into purple streams of light. With a tinkling sound, a few crystals fell to the ground. They were all high-valued ones with values exceeding 200.</p>
<p>One of them was a skill crystal, but no Companion Egg dropped.</p>
<p>‘Killed Hell creature, Starlord Ravenous Wolf. Discovered Dimensional Crystal.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen picked up the skill crystal and took a look. The stat requirements weren’t high—99 Constitution, Strength, Essence Energy, and Speed. Zhou Wen met all of these, but he needed a light-elemental Essence Energy Art which he could come up with a solution for. The only difficulty was the 99 Light-elemental stat.</p>
<p>The Light stat was a special attribute, so the chances of it dropping weren’t high. Zhou Wen had never downloaded a Light-elemental zone, so he hadn’t had many Light-elemental crystals drop. He was far from reaching the Light stat requirements.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was feeling depressed, he suddenly realized that one of the dimensional crystals that Starlord Ravenous Wolf dropped was Light-elemental.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, he absorbed the Light stat crystal that nearly reached 300 in value.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen achieved 99 Light stat points. This was the limit at the Terror grade as he hadn’t advanced to the Calamity grade. No matter how high the stat crystals he absorbed were, it was impossible for him to continue raising his stats.</p>
<p>This really doesn’t make sense. The limit of the Mythical stage’s stats is 81, but the limit of the Terror grade’s stats is 99. Isn’t the difference too small? Zhou Wen found it odd. The difference in values between the other levels was huge. It was about double. Only the difference between the Mythical stage and the Terror grade was tiny. He didn’t know why.</p>
<p>That was what he thought, but he could only come to terms with the reality. No matter how unreasonable it was, it couldn’t be changed. He could only adapt.</p>
<p>Thankfully, with 99 points of Light stats, he satisfied the requirements needed to absorb the skill crystal. What was lacking now was a Light-stat Terror transformation ability.</p>
<p>Among the Essence Energy Arts I simulated, the only one that can be associated with light is the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. That flame of life should be considered light, right? Zhou Wen wasn’t sure as he switched his Essence Energy Art to the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. Then, he picked up the skill crystal and attempted to absorb it.</p>
<p>Immediately, a hot and numbing force flowed out of the skill crystal and rushed into Zhou Wen’s body, making his entire body feel like it was being baked by high temperatures.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he was in-game. If he were outside, Zhou Wen’s clothes would have been burned to ashes by the high temperature.</p>
<p>The terrifying energy barbarically opened up a new Essence Energy circulation in Zhou Wen’s body. The terrifyingly high temperature and radiation energy made Zhou Wen believe that the blood-colored avatar’s body was about to collapse.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he ultimately survived and absorbed Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s skill crystal.</p>
<p>‘Absorbed Starlord Ravenous Wolf Crystal. Attained Hell-level Essence Energy Skill: Wolf Kiss.’</p>
<p>Wolf Kiss! Zhou Wen sensed the skill information from the Essence Energy Crystal and his expression turned odd. He opened the skill column and saw that it was indeed Wolf Kiss.</p>
<p>Wolf Kiss (Hell): The Ravenous Wolf Star is the Star of Desire. The Ravenous Wolf’s Kiss is earth-shattering.</p>
<p>What the hell! Zhou Wen was at a loss whether to laugh or cry. He originally imagined that with Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s powerful abilities, any random skill like a light blast, radiation, or high temperature would greatly increase the destructive power of his skills. To his surprise, he ended up with Wolf Kiss.</p>
<p>The skill introduction sounded very strong, but Zhou Wen couldn’t be hugging the enemy and kissing them amid his battle, right?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen imagined a scene of him fighting An Tianzuo. At the brink of losing, he could only use the only Hell-level skill he had—Wolf Kiss—to turn the tables.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>He then took the opportunity to hug An Tianzuo’s head and use Wolf Kiss. It was an unbearable sight.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen definitely hadn’t misunderstood the language describing the skill’s usage because the information had been transmitted to his brain by the Essence Energy Crystal. That was exactly how Wolf Kiss was used.</p>
<p>How can I use this skill! Zhou Wen was so depressed that he nearly vomited blood.</p>
<p>This skill wasn’t suitable to be used against men. If it was used on monsters, even if Zhou Wen could bring himself to kiss them, many monsters’ mouths would be extremely large. Ignoring kissing, Zhou Wen would just be giving them more protein if he really leaned his head over.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Although he didn’t know how powerful Wolf Kiss was, Zhou Wen was certain that he couldn’t use it casually.</p>
<p>Just like kowtowing could trigger the Sigh of the King—something Zhou Wen knew was useful—but he really couldn’t bring himself into such embarrassment. Most of the time, Zhou Wen was embarrassed to use that move.</p>
<p>Wolf Kiss was about the same, but Zhou Wen realized that he could use it at times after some thought.</p>
<p>He distributed the other stat crystals to the Companion Beasts that needed them. Banana Fairy’s stats were already maxed out. It was useless eating them without leveling up. The Soul Mirror was almost maxed as well. Raising stats wasn’t difficult for Zhou Wen. The difficult part was how to raise the level.</p>
<p>“If Banana Fairy can advance to the Calamity grade, she might be able to extinguish the sun with a gust of Supreme Yin Wind. I wouldn’t need to go through so much trouble!”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was just musing. If he wanted to extinguish the sun, it was unknown if the Apocalypse grade could do it, much less the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>After tidying up everything, Zhou Wen circled the palace again and realized that there was only one hall. There were no other exits behind it, nor were there any other palaces.</p>
<p>At the back of the palace was a strange altar. On it seemed to be some kind of runes used for rituals.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to stand on it as a notification popped up in-game: Do you want to teleport to Merak Star Palace?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood that the Big Dipper instance dungeon was indeed a serial dungeon. He guessed that there was a dungeon on each of the Big Dipper stars. He had to clear all seven dungeons to clear the Big Dipper instance dungeon.</p>
<p>Starlord Ravenous Wolf in the first dungeon is at the Hell level. Typically, dungeons become stronger the further one goes. I wonder how strong the dimensional creatures in the next six dungeons will be. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and chose no.</p>
<p>He wanted to see what would happen if he chose no.</p>
<p>System Notice: Do you want to teleport out of Dubhe Palace?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately chose ‘yes’ to see where he would teleport to.</p>
<p>The teleportation nexus flashed as the scene in front of Zhou Wen changed. There were dazzling flames everywhere. Zhou Wen looked around and realized that he was at the periphery of Dubhe.</p>
<p>There’s a way to return! Zhou Wen was overjoyed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1542'>Chapter 1542: Starlord Titan Gate</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Since the seven dungeons of the Big Dipper were separated, Zhou Wen could freely choose to continue heading to the next Star Palace after completing Dubhe. That was his chance.</p>
<p>All he needed to do was use the Cube to enter Dubhe Palace and clear it in reality. Then, he could teleport out and return to Earth.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, this was the only way to return to Earth before Demonic Neonate woke up.</p>
<p>It was no longer difficult for Zhou Wen to clear Dubhe Palace and kill Starlord Ravenous Wolf.</p>
<p>The more troublesome thing was Demonic Neonate and Grim Demon. Furthermore, he needed to find three people to ascend the Cube with him before he could activate the Cube and enter Dubhe Palace.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate was still sleeping and showed no signs of waking up. Furthermore, he couldn’t unsummon her. He couldn’t even send her into the chaos space.</p>
<p>It wasn’t impossible for him to carry her into Dubhe Palace, but Zhou Wen didn’t wish for so many people to see Demonic Neonate through the broadcast.</p>
<p>The most troublesome thing was to find three people to enter Dubhe Palace with him. The three would definitely die.</p>
<p>Although there were many people in Regretless City and it wasn’t difficult to find three people to send themselves to their deaths, Zhou Wen wasn’t such a person. He really couldn’t bring himself into forcing people with whom he had no grudge to die.</p>
<p>I’ll wait another two days before reassessing. It’s best if Demonic Neonate wakes up. If she doesn’t, I can only use the Cube to return. Zhou Wen launched the Big Dipper instance dungeon again.</p>
<p>After entering Dubhe Palace again, there was no Starlord Ravenous Wolf guarding it. From the looks of it, it hadn’t respawned.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen arrived at the teleportation nexus and chose to enter the next Merak Star Palace.</p>
<p>Merak was the second star of the Big Dipper. Merak was also known as the Titan Gate Star. According to what Zhou Wen knew, although Merak was several times bigger than the sun, there didn’t seem to be any planets around Merak. There was only a ring of relatively cold dust.</p>
<p>When the teleportation nexus was activated, the scene in front of Zhou Wen changed. When he regained his vision, he realized that a huge door had appeared in front of him. The door looked like the Arc de Triomphe, but it was even more majestic. It was probably a thousand meters tall and was carved from golden crystal. Standing in front of the extremely majestic door, Zhou Wen found himself as tiny as an ant.</p>
<p>And this was only the entrance to the Merak Star Palace. It was unimaginable how big the entire Star Palace was.</p>
<p>The Merak Star Palace had an entrance without a door. Zhou Wen stood on the steps outside the entrance and could see the scene inside.</p>
<p>The interior of the Star Palace was equally huge. It was more than enough to fly a helicopter inside. There were resplendent crystal pillars and walls everywhere.</p>
<p>Unlike Dubhe Palace’s simplicity, this Star Palace was extremely beautiful. The various carvings were opulent.</p>
<p>And at the back of the Star Palace, there was a huge crystal throne. A giant wearing golden crystal armor was sitting on the crystal throne with one hand supporting his chin as though he was deep in thought.</p>
<p>What a tall giant. Just sitting there makes it look about two hundred meters tall! Zhou Wen guessed what dimensional creature it was from the its appearance.</p>
<p>Since the guardian of Dubhe was Starlord Ravenous Wolf, this person was undoubtedly Starlord Titan Gate.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, Starlord Titan Gate opened his eyes. The eyes that were much bigger than car wheels opened as they emitted a terrifying golden glow. He stared at the spot where the blood-colored avatar was standing and slowly stood up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had never seen a dimensional creature’s aura as terrifying as Starlord Titan Gate’s. Perhaps other creatures were stronger than him, but in terms of aura, they might not be able to suppress him.</p>
<p>Looking at Starlord Titan Gate, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but think of the word “indomitable.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already prepared to fight a tough battle. From the size of Starlord Titan Gate, he knew that his body was definitely extremely powerful with extremely violent strength.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg could withstand the blast of light because it was an area-of-effect attack, resulting in greatly scattered strength. Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if the Chaos Egg could withstand a Strength-type dimensional creature like Starlord Titan Gate.</p>
<p>If I really can’t block his attacks, I can only place my hopes on dodging. Unfortunately, I gave my Heavenly Robe and lucky equipment to Wang Lu. Otherwise, it shouldn’t be difficult for me to dodge Starlord Titan Gate’s attack… Zhou Wen was still thinking of a countermeasure when he suddenly saw Starlord Titan Gate open his mouth.</p>
<p>In the next moment, a terrifying roar burst out of Starlord Titan Gate’s mouth, forming a sonic boom that instantly struck Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen never expected such a move. He imagined that Starlord Titan Gate was a Strength-type, so he never expected him to have a sonar attack.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen had fast reflexes. He summoned the Chaos Egg and protected himself.</p>
<p>When the sonic boom struck the Chaos Egg, a large number of solid Essence Energy Crystals were immediately produced inside. The number was about the same as when Starlord Ravenous Wolf attacked.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Starlord Titan Gate should also be at the Hell level. That’s good. Zhou Wen felt relieved.</p>
<p>If the Star Palaces were each stronger than the last in the Big Dipper instance dungeons, it was unimaginable how strong the guardian inside the final Star Palace would be. It would be impossible to clear it.</p>
<p>Starlord Titan Gate wasn’t much stronger than Starlord Ravenous Wolf. This gave Zhou Wen hope. Perhaps the seven Starlords of the Big Dipper were all at the Hell level, so he still had a chance of clearing the Big Dipper.</p>
<p>Although similar in strength to Starlord Ravenous Wolf, Starlord Titan Gate’s abilities were completely different. His sonic attack and Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s sonic booms were from completely different systems.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen relied on the Chaos Egg to take a beating. At the same time, he summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors and ordered it to attack Starlord Titan Gate.</p>
<p>However, not long after the Golden Wyrm Scissors flew out, its flying speed became slower and slower. Before it reached Starlord Titan Gate, the Golden Wyrm Scissors stopped.</p>
<p>No way? Starlord Titan Gate’s howl is so powerful that even the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ attack can’t completely tear through it? Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>Something even more unbelievable happened next. The Golden Wyrm Scissors flew back and fiercely rushed at the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg had no chance of dodging amidst the sonic booms. As for the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ destructive power, even the Chaos Egg couldn’t completely withstand it. A hole was torn open at the snipping point.</p>
<p>The howl rushed in through the hole, and then the phone screen went black.</p>
<p>What happened? Why did the Golden Wyrm Scissors suddenly turn against me? Zhou Wen hurriedly checked the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ information and realized that it was still intact. It was still his Companion Beast, so there wasn’t any problem.</p>
<p>However, he couldn’t figure out why the Golden Wyrm Scissors had suddenly lost control and attacked him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1543'>Chapter 1543: Jiuyang</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Starlord Titan Gate’s body doesn’t appear to be Strength-type, but sound-type. That’s quite surprising, Zhou Wen thought to himself. Furthermore, it should be Epsilon Ursae Majoris that represents sound, so why is Starlord Titan Gate a sound-type dimensional creature?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss. However, he was certain that the sonar shockwave alone wasn’t enough to make the Golden Wyrm Scissors attack its owner. There had to be other forces behind this.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen entered the dungeon a few more times and quickly figured out what was going on.</p>
<p>Starlord Titan Gate’s roar was indeed a sound-type ability. Furthermore, this sound-type power wasn’t just a vibrational attack. It also had powers similar to bewitchment.</p>
<p>That power was useless against Zhou Wen who was wearing the Truth Listener earring, but the Golden Wyrm Scissors and other Companion Beasts couldn’t seem to withstand the assault of that power. As long as they were too far from Zhou Wen, they could easily betray him.</p>
<p>This left Zhou Wen depressed. His strength wasn’t enough to fight Starlord Titan Gate. Now, he was relying on his Companion Beasts to keep him going. It was a serious problem if his Companion Beasts betrayed him if they were too far from him.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I’ll have to grind a few more times to study Starlord Titan Gate’s other weaknesses. Zhou Wen repeatedly grinded the Merak Star Palace. Although he was killed by Starlord Titan Gate every time, he still enjoyed it.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was studying Starlord Titan Gate, the various factions on Earth were still working hard on how to enter Dubhe Palace alive. All the fire-elemental dimensional creatures were repeatedly slaughtered by the various factions, pushing the prices of high-level fire-elemental defensive Companion Beasts to ridiculous levels.</p>
<p>Just as the various factions were gathering fire-elemental armor, the Cube’s screen stirred again. Someone had entered Dubhe Palace, and it was a human.</p>
<p>It was a young man in gorgeous armor who looked to be in his twenties or thirties.</p>
<p>“Human? How did he enter? How did he withstand such high temperatures?” No one knew the young man as they whispered.</p>
<p>“That’s strange. Isn’t it said that only four people can enter? Why is he alone?”</p>
<p>“What’s the point of entering? Under that blast of light, even the extremely powerful dinosaurs can’t withstand it. Death simply awaits him. From the looks of it, it should be a suicide squad from some faction used to scout the way, right?”</p>
<p>“There’s no doubt about it.”</p>
<p>“What a pity. He’s so handsome, but he’s dying just like that.” Women tended to focus on different things from men.</p>
<p>“Damn! I wonder which family’s the one letting such a young man die.”</p>
<p>The handsome young man couldn’t hear the discussions. Even if he heard them, he couldn’t be bothered.</p>
<p>He walked towards the Star Palace’s door one step after another, extended his flawless hands that were even more beautiful than a woman’s, and pushed open Dubhe Palace’s door.</p>
<p>Looking at Starlord Ravenous Wolf in the Star Palace, the young man walked in without any hesitation. When Starlord Ravenous Wolf saw someone enter the Star Palace, he unleashed a terrifying blast of light without a word.</p>
<p>The entire Star Palace and the square outside were instantly enveloped by the purple light blast. There were no blind spots.</p>
<p>The live broadcast of the Cube had been processed by the Cube. Even an ordinary person could see the young man’s figure in the blast of light.</p>
<p>Everyone thought that he was doomed, but in the blast of light, the young man didn’t show the horror and shock they had imagined.</p>
<p>The blast of light didn’t reduce his body to ashes. It didn’t even damage his hair. The armor on the young man’s body emitted a blinding light that was even more dazzling than the light blast. It was as though he was augmented by the sun.</p>
<p>“How… How is this possible… He’s actually fine… under such high temperatures and radiation… Is he still human?”</p>
<p>“When did such a young powerhouse appear among us humans?”</p>
<p>“Could he be Human Sovereign?”</p>
<p>Ordinary people discussed spiritedly as they guessed the young man’s origins. As for factions like the six families, they had already identified the young man’s background.</p>
<p>“Solar Holy Body. That young man should be from the Holy Land’s Sun God Holy Temple. I never expected the Holy Land to take action so quickly,” Zhang Chunqiu muttered to himself.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t the Family Clan of Gods also have the Solar Holy Body? Why can’t he be from the Family Clan of Gods?” Zhang Yuzhi asked in puzzlement as she watched the live broadcast.</p>
<p>“The Family Clan of Gods does have the Solar Holy Body from the Sun God Holy Temple, but the Family Clan of Gods doesn’t have that piece of armor he’s wearing. If I’m not wrong, that armor was transformed from a Guardian. Furthermore, it possesses the extremely pure power of the Sun. It’s even purer than the Solar Holy Body’s. I’m afraid only the fellows from the Sun God Holy Temple can create such a Guardian. The Family Clan of Gods doesn’t have it,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>The armor on the Saint from the Sun God Holy Temple emitted a divine solar glow, absorbing the power of the blast.</p>
<p>Under the attention of everyone, the Saint walked to the teleportation nexus and teleported out of Dubhe Palace.</p>
<p>Soon, the Cube’s screen switched to the rankings. It showed a new name. Furthermore, it was ranked ahead of Fire-Armored God—having obtained first place.</p>
<p>“Saint Jiuyang. He’s indeed from the Sun God Holy Temple,” Xia Liuchuan said with a frown.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this name, people realized that this young man was a Saint of the Holy Land.</p>
<p>“The Holy Land is indeed powerful. Any Saint can enter the rankings.”</p>
<p>Humans indeed rely on Guardians.</p>
<p>“That depends on who it is. Our Human Sovereign doesn’t need a Guardian.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid Human Sovereign can’t enter. Otherwise, why hasn’t he appeared?”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you curious why that Jiuyang can enter the dimensional zone alone?”</p>
<p>No one answered his question. Some thought of a possibility, but it was so cruel that they couldn’t say it out loud.</p>
<p>A human had not only cleared Dubhe Palace, but he had also overtaken the Fire-Armored God, clinching first place. Instantly, he was in the limelight. The entire Federation was discussing Jiuyang.</p>
<p>“Only Saints from the Sun God Holy Temple can pass through Dubhe Palace so easily, right?”</p>
<p>“Jiuyang is too cool.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid this is another powerhouse at the Human Sovereign level.”</p>
<p>Most people weren’t stingy with their praises. Even Professor Gu, who had always thought negatively, said in a program that Dubhe Palace was a dimensional zone tailor-made for Saint Jiuyang. It was unlikely any human could reach Jiuyang’s level.</p>
<p>If nothing went wrong, Jiuyang might very well obtain first place on the Cube’s rankings.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1544'>Chapter 1544: Humans Who Worship the Devil King</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Jiuyang, well done.” Xiao looked at Jiuyang who walked out of the Cube and greeted him with a smile.</p>
<p>“That’s no need for compliments. Even a pig can accomplish such a feat while wearing this Solar Holy Armor,” Jiuyang said coldly.</p>
<p>“You can’t say that. There are so many Saints in the Sun God Holy Temple. Only you were chosen to possess it. That’s your strength,” Xiao said.</p>
<p>Jiuyang’s expression didn’t change. “There’s nothing to be happy about. My opponents aren’t them to begin with. I only want to defeat Human Sovereign. Do you think Human Sovereign will appear this time?”</p>
<p>“Probably. Since he claims to be Human Sovereign, he’s not likely to sit back and watch us obtain the Dubhe Companion Beast,” Xiao said.</p>
<p>“That’s good.” After saying that, Jiuyang turned around and left, ignoring Xiao.</p>
<p>Seeing Jiuyang leave, Xiao sighed softly and muttered to himself, “I hope that fellow doesn’t go. Jiuyang and the Guardian on him are practically invincible in a place like Dubhe.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, who was grinding, suddenly sneezed. He wiped his nose and muttered to himself, “Ya’er must be missing me. It’s been so long since I went back to visit her. I wonder how she’s doing.”</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could find a way to kill Starlord Titan Gate and continue grinding, he heard screams and shouts coming from the city.</p>
<p>What’s happening? Zhou Wen turned his attention and immediately detected a huge snake that was as red as fire in Regretless City. It slithered across the streets and roofs, opened its mouth, and swallowed a human.</p>
<p>This is the Devil Snake they mentioned, right? Zhou Wen immediately thought of the information Grim Demon had previously obtained.</p>
<p>As the snake was at the Terror grade, the humans in Regretless City couldn’t see it after its Terror transformation. They could only be devoured by it.</p>
<p>Many people knelt on the ground and loudly prayed to the Devil King instead of God.</p>
<p>Seeing that the snake still wanted to devour more people, Zhou Wen instant transmitted over. He held the summoned Golden Wyrm Scissors in his hand and snipped the snake into two.</p>
<p>Splash! Splash!</p>
<p>After the snake died, its body exited its Terror form and fell to the ground. Large amounts of snake blood dyed the nearby streets red as though it had just rained blood.</p>
<p>“Your Devilish Excellency… Long live…” When people saw the snake corpse and Zhou Wen floating in the air, they immediately knelt towards him like pious believers, thanking him for saving their lives.</p>
<p>They seemed to be certain that Zhou Wen was Lost Paradise’s Devil King.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wish to explain. He searched the snake corpse and found an Essence Energy Crystal.</p>
<p>There are Essence Energy Crystals in dimensional creatures as well? Then, could there be Companion Eggs? Zhou Wen suddenly had the urge to kill all the dimensional bigwigs to see if he could find Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was just musing. At the very least, he wasn’t in the mood to experiment.</p>
<p>The humans only dared to get up after he returned to the cemetery. They looked at each other with mixed expressions.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Not long after Zhou Wen returned to the cemetery—before he could even take out his phone—he saw Grim Demon fly back.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Zhou Wen sized up Grim Demon and couldn’t help but frown when he realized that he was injured in several places.</p>
<p>“I’m fine. That snake didn’t get the better of me either.” Grim Demon recounted his experience.</p>
<p>There was indeed a red snake in the mountain range behind Regretless City. Furthermore, there were many of them. Grim Demon wanted to visit somewhere further away, but after a few roundabouts, he was still discovered by the red snake.</p>
<p>The average red snake was naturally not Grim Demon’s match. Grim Demon even killed those at the same Terror grade. However, when a Calamity-grade red snake appeared, Grim Demon had no choice but to escape.</p>
<p>“These red snakes are extraordinary. They must be related to the legendary Satan. Their bodies are much stronger than the typical creature at the same level,” Grim Demon said.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, he suddenly realized that the elder had arrived outside the cemetery with a few people.</p>
<p>“Your Devilish Excellency… I wish to seek an audience…” the elder said respectfully after knocking on the door.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” Zhou Wen walked to the door and opened it.</p>
<p>The elder hurriedly led the humans beside him to kneel and kowtow. After kowtowing, he pointed at the two girls beside him and said, “Your Devilish Excellency, these are the most beautiful girls in our city. I hope you like them.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen looked at the two girls beside the elder. They looked to be about seventeen or eighteen years old. They were extremely beautiful. Their noses were high and their big eyes were deep. They had West District features.</p>
<p>With long brownish-red hair, they exuded a different charm.</p>
<p>What was even more shocking was that the two girls looked identical. They were twins.</p>
<p>“Your Devilish Excellency, you have protected our Regretless City for so many years, preventing us from being harmed by creatures from the outside world. We only wish to repay you. Your Devilish Excellency, you haven’t brought any maids with you. That must be very inconvenient for you. If there’s anything you need, just instruct them…” the elder said.</p>
<p>“There’s no need.” Zhou Wen rejected it immediately. What day and age was it? Humans weren’t inferior to anyone. There was no need for them to kneel to others.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that the two girls would be happy that they didn’t have to serve him, but to his surprise, their faces turned pale when they heard his rejection.</p>
<p>One of the girls rushed forward and hugged Zhou Wen’s calf. “Your Devilish Excellency, please let us follow you. Do as you wish. Leave everything to us. Even if you want us dead, we will be absolutely willing. If you don’t like us, take our lives. We are willing to do anything for you…”</p>
<p>Looking at the sincere girl who looked like a crazy fangirl, Zhou Wen was somewhat speechless.</p>
<p>From the determined looks in the two girls’ eyes, they would immediately commit suicide if Zhou Wen didn’t let them stay.</p>
<p>“Leave the two of them behind. You are dismissed,” Zhou Wen said to the elder.</p>
<p>“Your Devilish Excellency, rest well. I won’t disturb you any further.” Only then did the elder relax. He didn’t dare look up as he kept his head lowered and bowed before leaving the cemetery. He even closed the door behind him.</p>
<p>“What are your names?” Zhou Wen asked as he sized up the two girls.</p>
<p>“I’m Liz. She’s my younger sister, Leem,” the girl who had hugged Zhou Wen’s leg pointed at her sister.</p>
<p>“What can you do?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“Your Devilish Excellency, we can do anything you instruct us to do,” Liz and Leem said at the same time with their heads lowered.. Their cheeks were abnormally red.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1545'>Chapter 1545: The Omniscient Devil King</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“I can get you two to do anything?” Zhou Wen sized up Liz and Leem and asked thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Liz and Leem trembled as their cheeks flushed even redder. Their bodies trembled as they lowered their heads and said, “It’s our honor to be able to offer ourselves to the Devil King.”</p>
<p>Before the two of them came, the City Lord had already explained plenty of things to them. It was because of this that they had such a vivid imagination.</p>
<p>“Your Devilish Excellency, you are the king of Lost Paradise. If we can give birth to Your Devilish Excellency’s son, we can break through the restrictions of the human body and let our descendants reach the Mythical stage. We can fight those gods and devils and no longer be fish on the chopping block. Whether our race can control our fates in the future will be up to you…”</p>
<p>Upon thinking of the City Lord’s serious tone, Liz and Lee couldn’t help but grit their teeth. Although they were still very afraid, they puffed up their chests and displayed their beautiful faces in front of Zhou Wen amidst trembling fear.</p>
<p>“If I were to let you die, would you be willing?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>He could only use the Cube to return, but four people were needed to enter the Cube. Zhou Wen still needed three, so he was still vexing over the numbers.</p>
<p>Liz and Leem immediately teared up when they heard that. They were extremely afraid. His Devilish Excellency is an omniscient existence. How can our schemes deceive him?</p>
<p>“Your Devilish Excellency, we were wrong. It’s both our fault. It has nothing to do with our clansmen. If you want to punish us, punish us. It doesn’t matter even if you want our lives,” Liz and Leem said as they knelt on the ground and trembled.</p>
<p>“What did you do wrong?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“We shouldn’t… shouldn’t have wanted… wanted…” Liz said ‘wanted’ a few times, but she couldn’t continue.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown. He imagined that the people from Regretless City were secretly plotting to harm him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was clearly reading too much into it. The people of Regretless City respected the Devil King like a god, so how could they dare harm him?</p>
<p>“We shouldn’t have wanted to use Your Devilish Excellency’s seed…” Leem said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen wasn’t drinking water. Otherwise, he would have choked to death. He widened his eyes as he looked at Liz and Leem kneeling in front of him, unable to believe his ears.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen even believed that he had heard wrongly. He wanted them to say it again, but on second thought, it was impossible for him to hear wrongly. It was pointless saying it again. It would only make him feel even more awkward.</p>
<p>“Since you know your mistake, tell me. How should I punish you?” Zhou Wen deliberately asked in a cold manner.</p>
<p>“Your Devilish Excellency, please forgive our clansmen. We are willing to commit suicide to atone for our sins.” Liz and Leem’s faces were filled with determination. They pulled out daggers, hoping to end their lives.</p>
<p>“Did I say I want you two dead?” Zhou Wen’s indifferent voice sounded. Liz and Leem looked at Zhou Wen in surprise, unsure what he meant.</p>
<p>Only now did they realize how capricious the Devil King was. They couldn’t infer anything via common human thought processes. They felt increasingly afraid and uneasy.</p>
<p>“Your lives no longer belong to you from now on,” Zhou Wen said to them.</p>
<p>“Yes, our lives are yours, Your Devilish Excellency.” Liz and Leem immediately knelt.</p>
<p>“Get up. Prepare some food before cleaning up this place.” Zhou Wen kept them because he wanted to use them when he entered the Cube in the future. He didn’t need them for the time being.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was very curious about the food they ate. It was a perfect chance for him to sample it.</p>
<p>Liz and Leem left the cemetery gratefully as though they had been pardoned.</p>
<p>They went back and told the City Lord about the matter. The City Lord and company were so frightened that their faces turned pale and they nearly peed their pants. Only when they heard the whole story did they feel a lot better.</p>
<p>“The Devil King is indeed an omniscient existence. How can he not know my scheme? I nearly harmed all the clansmen in the city… Thankfully, the Devil King gave us a chance… Liz, Leem… Prepare the best food in our city. No matter what, we have to satisfy the Devil King…” After the elder said that, he felt worried. He personally made the preparations and meticulously did everything to perfection. Finally, he handed the finished product to Liz and Leem and got them to take the food into the cemetery.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was grinding when he saw each of them bring in a basin. The basins contained clear water with a few crystalline green leaves soaked in them.</p>
<p>“Your Devilish Excellency, please have your meal.” Liz and Leem knelt in front of Zhou Wen and raised the two basins above their heads.</p>
<p>Are these leaves delicious? Zhou Wen was puzzled, but he still reached out to take a leaf and put it in his mouth to chew a little.</p>
<p>Just one mouthful made Zhou Wen frown. Although the leaf wasn’t terrible, it definitely wasn’t delicious. It tasted similar to the vegetable leaves on Earth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t like western food or raw vegetables. He looked at the two sisters and asked, “Do you usually eat this?”</p>
<p>“Your Devilish Excellency, this is a precious leaf of the Jadeite Grass. It’s a very rare and delicious food. It’s very rare to gather it, and it’s impossible for ordinary people to eat it. Only during ceremonies and rituals will everyone get a little…” Liz answered.</p>
<p>“Then what do you usually eat?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“Usually we eat the roots of the stone grass,” Liz answered.</p>
<p>“Bring me the roots of the stone grass.” Zhou Wen really couldn’t imagine that such vegetable-like leaves were the precious food they were talking about. How terrible would the food they usually ate be?</p>
<p>The two sisters were horrified, believing that Zhou Wen wasn’t satisfied with their hospitality and wanted to beg for mercy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen repeatedly said that he didn’t blame them and got them to retrieve the stone grass’s roots before they left in disbelief.</p>
<p>When they brought the stone grass’s roots over, Zhou Wen found them not bad—the roots were jade-white and were as thick as a finger. They were rather beautiful.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen bit it, he immediately felt a bitter liquid flow into his mouth.</p>
<p>Is this thing edible at all? Zhou Wen suspected that the people of Regretless City were messing with him. How could something even more bitter than bitter melon be the food they usually ate?</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen roughly scanned the area with Truth Listener and knew that they weren’t lying to him. Most of the people in Regretless City were eating this.</p>
<p>Looking at the trembling sisters, Zhou Wen sighed inwardly. The people in Regretless City have it worse than the people on Earth.</p>
<p>Humans had stood at the top of the food chain for thousands of years on Earth. At the very least, they had experienced enjoyment. These people were at the bottom of the food chain in the dimension. They couldn’t even eat meat, much less have enjoyment. Any dimensional creature was at the Mythical stage. Who could they kill?</p>
<p>“This is for you..” Zhou Wen took out two pieces of bread and threw them at the sisters.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1546'>Chapter 1546: Ancient Snake</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Liz and Leem caught the bread and looked at Zhou Wen in fear. They didn’t know what Zhou Wen had given them.</p>
<p>At Zhou Wen’s gesture, they realized that it was food. When they took a bite, their eyes widened in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Your Devilish Excellency… You… You are too good to us… This is the food of gods and devils, right? You actually rewarded us with the food of gods and devils… Even if we die, we won’t be able to repay your kindness…” Liz and Leem were so touched that tears came to their eyes as they repeatedly thanked him.</p>
<p>How pitiful. They are so touched just from eating bread. If I were to give you two meat buns, wouldn’t you be so touched that your entire family would willingly become servants… Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>“Clean up the cemetery after you are done eating.” Zhou Wen returned to the rocking chair he had taken out and continued grinding.</p>
<p>He wanted to give it another try and see if there was a way to bring people in and out alive. These people had suffered terribly. Zhou Wen really couldn’t bear to exchange their lives for his chance to return home.</p>
<p>“Master, we shall take our leave.” Zhou Wen didn’t notice that Liz and Leem addressed him differently.</p>
<p>They couldn’t bear to eat the bread at all. They carefully put it away before cleaning the cemetery. From time to time, they would steal glances at Zhou Wen, who was lying in the rocking chair, gaming.</p>
<p>To them, everything about Zhou Wen was novel and mysterious.</p>
<p>“How naive. They actually sold their lives for two loaves of bread. What a joke,” Grim Demon said with a twitch of his lips.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing funny about it. It’s the same for you Guardians, much less them,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Nonsense. How can I be like them?” Grim Demon was immediately displeased.</p>
<p>“How is it different? To them, bread is something they have never had before. Therefore, they will be touched. To you, the rare items that can enhance your strength will also make you work hard. In essence, they are just rare items. There’s no difference,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“How can it be the same? It’s completely different, alright?” Grim Demon retorted.</p>
<p>“Then tell me. What’s different?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“There are many differences. The value of the items is different, and the effects are different…” Grim Demon retorted.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored Grim Demon and continued gaming.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you saying anything? Are you faking death just because you can’t win the argument? Speak!” Grim Demon circled around Zhou Wen, but Zhou Wen ignored him. He was so anxious that he flew into a rage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen treated him as air and ignored him.</p>
<p>Grim Demon kept talking in a huff; if he hadn’t realized that he couldn’t beat Zhou Wen, he would have long slapped him.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen frowned and looked up at the sky above the mountain city.</p>
<p>“You worms actually dare to kill my race’s living beings. I originally wanted to raise you as food, but now that you have a death wish, all of you can die.” A sharp and strange eunuch-like voice sounded. On the mountain peak behind Regretless City was a huge red snake. Its body was coiled around the mountain, and its huge head was hanging above Regretless City as it occasionally flicked its tongue.</p>
<p>The snake was massive. Just its head was about half the size of Regretless City.</p>
<p>The humans in the city were alarmed and many of them collapsed to the ground in fright. Such a huge snake only needed one mouthful to devour them all. Running was futile.</p>
<p>“Not good. Why is this fellow here!” Grim Demon was alarmed when he saw the huge snake. He called out to Zhou Wen, hoping to get him to escape.</p>
<p>Grim Demon had previously encountered this huge snake and nearly failed to return.</p>
<p>“Master… Please save our clansmen…” Liz and Leem rushed over and repeatedly kowtowed to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you a chance now. You worm-like creatures have no ability to kill my race. Tell me, who killed it? Today, I can spare half of you. I’ll only eat half.” The snake’s voice sounded again.</p>
<p>Everyone was even more alarmed. The snake imagined that these humans would quickly yield and tell it who had killed the ancient snake.</p>
<p>However, although everyone was trembling, no one exposed the culprit. All of them knelt on the ground and prayed in Zhou Wen’s direction as they muttered something about the Devil King.</p>
<p>“It looks like none of you wish to live.” The snake was enraged. It opened its mouth and was about to devour a portion of the humans. They would naturally speak once they felt fear.</p>
<p>However, before the snake could exert its strength, it heard a voice say: “I killed that snake.”</p>
<p>The snake stopped and looked down at the source of the sound.</p>
<p>A human stood on the roof of a stone building. The voice had come from that human.</p>
<p>“A mere human actually dares to lie in front of me. You do seem to have a death wish, and I’ll fulfill your wish,” the snake said as it sucked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>A huge suction force sucked everything near Zhou Wen into the snake’s mouth like a tornado.</p>
<p>Liz, Leem, and the nearby humans were swept into the air as they screamed while flying towards the snake’s mouth.</p>
<p>“Master!” Liz and Leem were still shouting, while the others were calling ‘Devil King.’</p>
<p>At this moment, no one exposed Zhou Wen. It was obvious that their fear of the Devil King was above the huge snake.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his hand and beckoned. The Golden Wyrm Scissors transformed into a golden beam of light that slashed at the snake.</p>
<p>The snake never expected a human to have such powerful strength. It was too late by the time it saw the Golden Wyrm Scissors.</p>
<p>Blood spewed out from the snake’s body as it opened its mouth to bite at the Golden Wyrm Scissors, hoping to swallow it.</p>
<p>However, the Golden Wyrm Scissors sliced the snake’s head into two. The blood in the snake’s body immediately flowed down the mountain like a waterfall.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The snake’s body also plummeted, just seconds away from crashing into the city.</p>
<p>The snake’s body was even bigger than Regretless City. If it was hit, the entire city would probably be destroyed.</p>
<p>Roar! Tyrant Behemoth was summoned by Zhou Wen. Its huge body stood at the foot of the mountain as it held the snake’s body with its claws, preventing it from falling.</p>
<p>“Long live the Devil King…” The City Lord led everyone to kneel in Zhou Wen’s direction. They naturally regarded Tyrant Behemoth as a devil summoned by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>From their point of view, as long as the Devil King was in the city, they wouldn’t have to worry about the threat of dimensional creatures in the future. How could there be an existence stronger than the Devil King in the world?</p>
<p>“Master!” Liz and Leem’s eyes glistened as they knelt there and looked at Zhou Wen with adulation.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1547'>Chapter 1547: Devil King’s Food</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth placed the huge snake at the foot of the mountain. Tyrant Behemoth easily tore apart the huge snake after it lost its energy and life.</p>
<p>Not long after, Zhou Wen saw that a portion of the snake’s bones was blood-red and emitted strange energy. It was likely the body of a Calamity-grade creature.</p>
<p>These parts were stored in the Chaos Bead by Zhou Wen. They were good items obtained from a Calamity-grade creature. After advancing to the Calamity grade, he needed such high-energy flesh and bones to replenish his energy. Otherwise, he might really starve to death.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi and company were examples. After leaving Earth, they had to hunt Calamity creatures to maintain their energy.</p>
<p>Inside the snake’s corpse, he discovered a Companion Egg. It excited Zhou Wen greatly. This was a Calamity-grade Companion Beast—an extremely rare drop.</p>
<p>There was too much snake meat left. Zhou Wen only stored a portion in his chaos space. The rest was used to improve the lives of the people in Regretless City.</p>
<p>Many people here had never eaten meat in their lives. They didn’t even know how to barbecue. It was only when Zhou Wen taught them barbecuing methods that they began eating roasted snake meat.</p>
<p>Just a mouthful of snake meat without any seasoning was sufficient to make many people cry in excitement.</p>
<p>“Long live the Devil King…” Many people praised Zhou Wen as they ate the snake meat.</p>
<p>In the distant valley, a tiny snake peeked its head out from the crack in the mountain. After watching for a while, it burrowed into the mountain and vanished.</p>
<p>“Your Devilish Excellency, this meat is delicious. I left you the best part.” Liz ran over with a bowl of snake meat and offered it to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“You can have it.” Calamity-grade snake meat was definitely delicious, but they were like barbarians. They ate it directly after roasting it. Ignoring cumin and chili powder, they didn’t even sprinkle any salt. Zhou Wen wasn’t used to this.</p>
<p>Furthermore, their roasting standards were terrible. Some spots weren’t properly cooked while other spots were charred.</p>
<p>“Your Devilish Excellency, this is specially for you. If Liz were to eat it, she would definitely be cursed to death by everyone.” Leem was much more lively. Although she still respected Zhou Wen, she wasn’t as reserved as before.</p>
<p>Perhaps because he had saved Regretless City, the sisters felt that the Devil King already treated them like family.</p>
<p>“Come over,” Zhou Wen called out to Liz.</p>
<p>Liz came over with a bowl and picked up a piece of snake meat. “Master, let me serve you.”</p>
<p>“Put it on the table.” Zhou Wen was at a loss whether to laugh or cry. This place was too backward. There wasn’t even a knife or fork to eat, much less chopsticks. All they did was grab food with their hands.</p>
<p>Right, all they eat are grass, roots, and leaves. There’s no need for utensils. Zhou Wen thought about it and understood their difficulties.</p>
<p>All Liz could do was place the bowl on the table. Zhou Wen took out his fork and knife and sliced off the parts that weren’t cooked and charred, leaving only a portion that was better roasted.</p>
<p>Then, he took out his barbecue seasonings and sprinkled them on the meat before cutting it into small pieces and slowly eating with chopsticks.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen preferred skewers, but these fellows roasted the meat in large chunks. He could only make do.</p>
<p>Liz and Leem widened their eyes as they watched Zhou Wen. They had never seen anyone eat like Zhou Wen. They felt that the chopsticks were like divine artifacts.</p>
<p>Master is indeed the Devil King. He looks so beautiful and elegant even when eating, Liz thought.</p>
<p>As for Leem, she was in a daze as she looked at the meat. She had an acute sense of smell. The fragrance emitted by the seasoned roasted meat was completely different from the original meat. The smell made Leem’s saliva involuntarily secrete quickly. She couldn’t help but gulp as her stomach rumbled.</p>
<p>They tried roasting meat and when their technique was passable, they immediately delivered Zhou Wen a piece of meat that was better roasted. They hadn’t even had a bite.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to eat this. Eat it. Don’t waste it.” Zhou Wen put down his chopsticks and walked back to his rocking chair. He lay down and took out his phone to check his information.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Master.” Liz and Leem saw that Zhou Wen’s chopsticks and fork were placed there, but they didn’t dare use them. All they did was carefully lift the roasted meat with their hands.</p>
<p>When the roasted meat entered their mouths, they first felt the saltiness from the salt and the spiciness from the chili powder, then the freshness of cumin. Finally, the tender meat and the fragrance of the meat juices seeped out and instantly filled their entire mouths.</p>
<p>This complex taste in the two sisters’ mouths inundated their taste buds. It was an experience they had never had. They felt as though their hearts had melted with this mouthful of roasted meat.</p>
<p>Is this the food the Devil King eats? It’s really delicious. It’s great to be serving the Devil King. Even if I were to die now, I wouldn’t have any regrets. The two girls felt that they had lived all those years in vain.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen knew what they were thinking, he would probably be at a loss whether to laugh or cry. Just a bit of roasted meat was enough to exchange for two lives. It was as though human lives were worth nothing.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to pay attention to them. He didn’t know what they were thinking either.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was checking Tyrant Behemoth’s stats. The stats after Tyrant Behemoth’s evolution didn’t exceed Zhou Wen’s expectations.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth: Calamity (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Extreme Strength, Mountain River Absorption</p>
<p>Life Soul: Violent Crown</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Absolute Strength (S-grade)</p>
<p>Terror Form: Tyrant</p>
<p>Calamity Zone: Overlord Zone (Human Realm)</p>
<p>Strength: 100</p>
<p>Speed: 100</p>
<p>Constitution: 100</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 100</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Mountain Consuming, Rampage, Behemoth, Armor Breaker, Penetration, Ripping, Poison Fang, Bite, Ever-Victorious, Unstoppable.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Boxing Glove</p>
<p>The stats and skills were within Zhou Wen’s expectations. He mainly wanted to see what the Calamity Zone was. From the introduction, the Overlord Zone was likely a domain that enhanced strength.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t study it too much. He would slowly experiment when he had the chance in the future. Now, what Zhou Wen mainly wanted to study was the huge snake Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already stored the Companion Egg in-game and checked its stats.</p>
<p>Ancient Snake: Calamity</p>
<p>Life Providence: Devil</p>
<p>Life Soul: Snake Devil</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Devil’s Tongue (S-grade)</p>
<p>Terror Form: Blood Shadow</p>
<p>Calamity Zone: Temptation Zone (Hell-level)</p>
<p>Strength: 278</p>
<p>Speed: 267</p>
<p>Constitution: 245</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 232</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Whale Devouring, Poison Fangs, Rend</p>
<p>Companion Form: Staff</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully studied the Ancient Snake’s information and realized that it was a surprising Companion Beast. This was the first time he had seen a staff as a companion form.</p>
<p>Previously, he had heard that there were magic staff-type Companion Beasts in the West District. The magic staff itself came with magical spells.</p>
<p>However, the staff formed by the Ancient Snake was still somewhat different from ordinary magic staffs.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t think much of the Ancient Snake’s skill, but its Calamity Zone seemed rather interesting.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1548'>Chapter 1548: Accidental Kill</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Legend has it that Satan transformed into an ancient snake and lured Adam and Eve into depravity. Is the Temptation Zone of this Ancient Snake related to that legend? Zhou Wen guessed.</p>
<p>To know the exact effects of the Temptation Zone, he had to give it a try. Zhou Wen hatched the Ancient Snake and summoned it in its staff form.</p>
<p>A snake-headed staff appeared in Zhou Wen’s hand. It was about two meters long. The head of the staff was a snake’s head, and its end was a snake’s tail. In the middle was a coiled snake’s body that was as red as blood. Its eyes were like two rubies that shimmered with a demonic glow. It looked extremely bizarre.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen waved it a few times and injected Essence Energy into it, but he realized that the staff didn’t have any long-range attacks or any spells.</p>
<p>What kind of crappy staff is this? Is it expecting a mage to use a staff like a daibo? Will that make me a mage or a warrior? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>He entered a dungeon in-game with the Ancient Snake and allowed it to take form. A huge ancient snake appeared in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>With such a huge body, it was definitely powerful in melee combat. However, what Zhou Wen wanted to know wasn’t its melee abilities, but the capabilities of its domain.</p>
<p>Dimensional creatures rushed towards Zhou Wen. Although the dimensional creatures were low-level creatures without even a single Mythical creature, Zhou Wen still got the Ancient Snake to use its domain as a test of its abilities.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that a Companion Beast like the Ancient Snake would cause quite a stir when it released its domain, but to his surprise, it didn’t have any lighting effects. All he heard was a faint sound coming from the Ancient Snake’s mouth. Although it wasn’t loud, it was like the murmur of a devil. It left Zhou Wen vexed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen just felt frustrated. The other dimensional creatures that approached the Ancient Snake seemed to go mad as they fought each other. The scene devolved into pandemonium.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was overjoyed. Clearly, the Temptation Zone was a domain that could throw the enemy into disarray. It could even make the enemy kill each other. This reminded Zhou Wen of the dimensional creature on Merak Star. Its sound-type ability made the Golden Wyrm Scissors switch sides. There seemed to be some similarities.</p>
<p>He walked deeper into the dungeon with the Ancient Snake. This feeling was indeed great. There was no need for him to do it himself as the dimensional creatures began fighting themselves. He felt like a god playing with life.</p>
<p>However, the Temptation Zone wasn’t invincible. Zhou Wen attempted to get the Ancient Snake to use the Temptation Zone on him, but it was useless. All it did was pressure him mentally.</p>
<p>The creature on Merak seems to have similar abilities, but the effects are stronger than the Ancient Snake’s Temptation Zone. I wonder if using the Ancient Snake’s Temptation Zone can resist Starlord Titan Gate’s strength.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen immediately launched the Big Dipper instance dungeon. Starlord Ravenous Wolf of the Dubhe Palace hadn’t respawned, so Zhou Wen went straight to the Merak Star Palace and faced Starlord Titan Gate again.</p>
<p>Starlord Titan Gate let out another terrifying roar as a powerful shockwave surged over. Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors and the Ancient Snake while he protected himself with the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrm Scissors went against the sound wave, but the Ancient Snake stayed in place. It flicked its tongue, letting out a strange murmur.</p>
<p>The Ancient Snake’s murmurs weren’t lethal. Starlord Titan Gate’s roar vanished upon clashing with the murmurs. It was almost inaudible.</p>
<p>The Ancient Snake had thick skin and flesh, so it could temporarily withstand it. What Zhou Wen was most worried about was the Golden Wyrm Scissors flying back and attacking him ruthlessly.</p>
<p>Strangely, nothing like that happened. The Golden Wyrm Scissors quickly rushed over and chopped off Starlord Titan Gate’s head with one strike.</p>
<p>‘Killed Starlord Titan Gate. Discovered Dimensional Crystal.’</p>
<p>He died just like that? Zhou Wen found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>Starlord Titan Gate only dropped two stat crystals—there were no Companion Eggs. It left Zhou Wen somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>However, killing Starlord Titan Gate was already a pleasant surprise. He couldn’t demand any more.</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrm Scissors is really useful. As long as it can get close, it can slice apart anything at the same level. Zhou Wen’s fondness for the Golden Wyrm Scissors increased.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had also attempted the Venusian instance dungeon. He was killed by the strange artifact every time. Up to now, Zhou Wen didn’t know what the artifact was, nor had he won once.</p>
<p>It was useless even if he had the Hell-level Golden Wyrm Scissors. He died the same way.</p>
<p>After feeding the stat crystal to the Companion Beast, Zhou Wen arrived at the back of the Merak Star Palace. Indeed, there was a teleportation nexus there.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen chose to head to the third star, Phecda.</p>
<p>There was little information about Phecda. It wasn’t as famous as Dubhe and Merak. Zhou Wen only knew its name, but he wasn’t too sure about its legends.</p>
<p>Phecda Star Palace wasn’t as exaggerated as the Merak Star Palace. It looked like an ordinary temple on Earth.</p>
<p>Opening the door to Phecda Star Palace, he saw a person in green armor inside. Zhou Wen only remembered Phecda, but he couldn’t recall the corresponding Starlord’s name.</p>
<p>Regardless of what Starlord the other party was, Zhou Wen only had one set of moves. He used the Golden Wyrm Scissors and the Ancient Snake’s Temptation Zone.</p>
<p>The green-armored Starlord didn’t seem to be as ferocious as Starlord Ravenous Wolf and Starlord Titan Gate. When the Golden Wyrm Scissors flew over, he didn’t seem to react at all.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The green-armored Starlord was sliced into two by the Golden Wyrm Scissors. Zhou Wen imagined that he had successfully passed the test and could head to the next Star Palace when he heard a crack. The Golden Wyrm Scissors had snapped.</p>
<p>How did that happen? Zhou Wen was alarmed. The Golden Wyrm Scissors was one of the strongest at the Hell level. Even a Heaven-level creature would find it difficult to snap it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen didn’t discover anything lunging at the Golden Wyrm Scissors. It looked like it had snapped on its own.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it was in-game. Otherwise, it would have been a huge loss if the Golden Wyrm Scissors had snapped.</p>
<p>As for the green-armored Starlord that had been sliced into two, his body strangely recovered when the Golden Wyrm Scissors snapped as though he had never been injured.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated as he got the Ancient Snake to charge over.</p>
<p>The Ancient Snake’s Temptation Zone didn’t seem to be of much use to the green-armored Starlord. He stood there without being affected. The Ancient Snake bit down and swallowed him.</p>
<p>The tiny body of the green-armored Starlord wasn’t even enough to fill the gaps between the Ancient Snake’s teeth.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could rejoice, the Ancient Snake’s massive body suddenly shrank rapidly. The green-armored Starlord appeared out of thin air from the Ancient Snake’s body. Instead, it opened its mouth wide and swallowed the now minified Ancient Snake.</p>
<p>What’s going on? What’s wrong with this fellow? Zhou Wen was dumbfounded.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1549'>Chapter 1549: Something’s Not Right</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The green-armored Starlord stood there without any intention of taking the initiative to attack. He stared coldly at the blood-colored avatar as though he was saying: “Didn’t you want to kill me? Bring it on.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned Bamboo Blade and slashed at the green-armored Starlord.</p>
<p>The green-armored Starlord didn’t dodge. He stood there, allowing Zhou Wen free rein to slash at him.</p>
<p>The Bamboo Blade in Zhou Wen’s hand was as fast as lightning as he slashed at the green-armored Starlord repeatedly. With the Bamboo Blade’s destructive power and Zhou Wen’s strength, he had strength equivalent to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>He only left scuffs on the armor after slashing more than a hundred times. He failed to really injure the green-armored Starlord.</p>
<p>Wounds appeared on Zhou Wen’s body one after another. The spot where his body was injured was where the Bamboo Blade had left a saber mark on the green-armored Starlord.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen stopped his saber, the green-armored Starlord suddenly punched the blood-colored avatar, killing it. The game screen went black.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t immediately enter the game again. Instead, he closed his eyes to recall the battle.</p>
<p>The power of the green-armored Starlord appears reflective, but it’s definitely not as simple as a reflection. No matter how strong a reflection is, it’s impossible for him to identically transfer his injuries to someone else… The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more excited he became.</p>
<p>He liked such novel dungeons. It was very boring to always grind repetitive dungeons.</p>
<p>He failed to figure out the problem despite plenty of thinking. All he could do was continue grinding dungeons.</p>
<p>He didn’t know how many times he tried, but the outcome was the same. No matter what kind of attack hit the green-armored Starlord, the injuries would return to him. It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>He came up with all sorts of methods. He could only defend without attacking; otherwise, just injuring the green-armored Starlord would doom him.</p>
<p>It was useless to blindly send himself to his death again and again, so Zhou Wen decided not to grind the Big Dipper instance dungeon. He switched to other dungeons to change his train of thought.</p>
<p>However, even if he couldn’t kill the green-armored Starlord, Zhou Wen still had a chance of returning home. He was probably the only one on Earth who could kill two Starlords in a row.</p>
<p>“Master, here’s your roasted meat.” Leem delivered roasted meat during meal time.</p>
<p>“You can have it.” Zhou Wen had been having a lot of roasted meat recently and was sick of it. He really couldn’t force himself to eat it.</p>
<p>“That’s not too nice, right? This is for you, Master,” Leem said.</p>
<p>“I told you to eat it. Do you dare say no? Just eat it in peace,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Master.” Although Leem said that, she didn’t eat the roasted meat. She continued looking at Zhou Wen eagerly.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw Leem’s expression, he immediately understood what she was up to. He took out some seasonings and handed them to her. “Sprinkle them yourself.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for the reward, Master.” Leem held the seasoning bottles and was so excited that she nearly couldn’t say a word.</p>
<p>Humans here are easily satisfied. When they come into contact with the flourishing Earth, I’m afraid there won’t be such simple happiness, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Leem took the seasonings and ran to Liz. The two of them sprinkled seasonings on the roasted meat and ate until their mouths were covered in oil.</p>
<p>You’re at the Epic stage after all. There’s no need for you to eat so messily. Zhou Wen shook his head with a wistful smile.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen realized something. He looked at Liz and Leem again. Something’s amiss. Liz and Leem are at the Epic stage. To be able to reach the Epic stage at their age means they are extremely impressive geniuses based on my experience on Earth. But how did they advance to the Epic stage?</p>
<p>The humans in Regretless City were too weak, so weak that Zhou Wen didn’t even realize a problem with them.</p>
<p>However, on careful thought, most of the humans in the city were at the Legendary stage. There were also quite a number of Epic experts, but how had they advanced?</p>
<p>There were no low-level dimensional creatures in a place like Regretless City. The weakest dimensional creature outside was at the Mythical stage, but Regretless City couldn’t even find a single Mythical creature. How could they hunt?</p>
<p>“Liz, let me ask you something. You need to answer truthfully,” Zhou Wen called her over and asked.</p>
<p>“I’ll answer anything, Master,” Liz hurriedly said.</p>
<p>“How do the humans in your city advance all the way from the Mortal stage? What tools do they usually use?</p>
<p>“What does advancing mean?” Liz asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Do you know about Life Providences and Life Souls?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.</p>
<p>“Yes, isn’t that something that comes with birth? There’s no need to advance,” Liz answered.</p>
<p>“You have them from birth? Are you sure?” This time, Zhou Wen was truly excited. It was unimaginably simple. Humans here were born at the Legendary or Epic stage.</p>
<p>“Of course I’m sure. Everyone in our city has a Life Providence after being born. Some stronger children will even have a Life Soul at birth,” Liz said after some thought.</p>
<p>How did these fellows do it? From the looks of it, I have to investigate. Zhou Wen decided to figure out why the people in Regretless City received such treatment.</p>
<p>“Liz, what’s your Life Providence and Life Soul?” Zhou Wen asked her first.</p>
<p>Liz and Leem walked over. Upon hearing Zhou Wen ask them, they explained their Life Providences and Life Soul abilities in detail.</p>
<p>The more Zhou Wen listened, the more alarmed he became. Their Life Providences and Life Souls were very special. They were better than the Life Providences and Life Souls of many humans on Earth.</p>
<p>“Get the City Lord over.” Seeing that Liz and Leem couldn’t explain it clearly, Zhou Wen planned on summoning someone useful over. Perhaps he could explain it clearly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen learned some useful information from the City Lord.</p>
<p>It was said that the humans in Regretless City were indeed very weak in the past, but as time passed, they slowly became stronger.</p>
<p>In the past, babies born were very normal. They were all at the Mortal stage, but over the generations, babies born in Regretless City now had extremely powerful abilities at the Legendary stage. There were even terrifying existences at the Epic stage.</p>
<p>The City Lord couldn’t explain the exact reason.</p>
<p>“I had a few guesses before, but I couldn’t confirm them,” the City Lord said after some thought.</p>
<p>“Share them with me.” Zhou Wen was now very interested in these things.</p>
<p>“There are three reasons according to legend. One is that because we often eat grass roots, they improve our physiques and make us better.”</p>
<p>“What about the second?” Zhou Wen felt that this theory wasn’t reliable. He had recently tried everything they ate. There was nothing special about the grass roots. They weren’t even considered ordinary dimensional plants. At most, they were considered mutated plants.</p>
<p>“The second theory is related to a treasure in Regretless City. Legend has it that there’s a treasure buried there.. Two ancestors brought it out of the Garden of Eden,” the City Lord said after some hesitation.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1550'>Chapter 1550: Treasure Hunting in Regretless City</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>A treasure from the Garden of Eden? Zhou Wen frowned in thought.</p>
<p>Legend has it that Adam and Eve were banished from the Garden of Eden because they secretly ate the forbidden fruit. What could they have taken out of the Garden of Eden? The forbidden fruit? This was the only thing Zhou Wen could think of.</p>
<p>However, there were definitely many good things in the Garden of Eden. If they took something else along the way, it wouldn’t be something Zhou Wen could guess.</p>
<p>Regretless City looks very ordinary, but it has evilness lurking in it. There are two puppets in Adam and Eve’s tombs. It also said that there’s some treasure buried under the city that allows humans to have Life Providences and Life Souls. This place is really odd, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>The City Lord stole a glance at Zhou Wen and said cowardly, “There’s also a third guess. It’s said that this place is protected by your magical power, allowing us to have everything we have now. I believe that this is the truth. Everything we have is given to us by you, Your Devilish Excellency.”</p>
<p>“Alright, you may leave.” After Zhou Wen sent the City Lord away, he thought about what he had said.</p>
<p>The third possibility wasn’t high, and the first was even more ridiculous. Zhou Wen had also eaten the roots of the stone grass. They were the roots of ordinary plants. Even if they had any effects, they could at best be treated as herbs. It was impossible to use them to evolve humans to such significance.</p>
<p>The second possibility was most likely. However, Zhou Wen was very interested in what treasures lay beneath Regretless City. He wanted to know what kind of treasure could make humans have such a high starting point.</p>
<p>How can I find it? Zhou Wen planned on trying.</p>
<p>Truth Listener’s ability was very strong. It could even pass through a thick mountain and hear a cave’s interior. However, beneath Regretless City was just pure mountain. There were no caves.</p>
<p>Since the item isn’t in the mountain body, the most likely possibility is that it’s in Regretless City. Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to constantly scan the area, not missing out on any detail, hoping to find some clues.</p>
<p>Buildings in Regretless City had rather interesting styles. There were all sorts of statues, carvings, and murals. Zhou Wen repeatedly scanned them, but he didn’t discover any power that could allow humans to evolve.</p>
<p>Could it be that the treasure in Regretless City is related to the two puppets? After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that the most mysterious thing in Regretless City was likely the two puppets.</p>
<p>If it was really because of the two puppets, Zhou Wen really didn’t dare dig them out. Grim Demon’s lesson was still fresh in his mind. Who knew what strange things would happen if he got the two puppets out?</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to give up just like that. Now that he was establishing a city in Guide City, if there was really such a treasure, it would bring unimaginable benefits if he buried it in his city.</p>
<p>Ignoring the improvements of newborns, just advertising the effects would bring Zhou Wen huge benefits.</p>
<p>Which parent didn’t want their descendants to gain an early advantage? Who didn’t want their children to be better than others? The stronger one was, the stronger their descendants would be.</p>
<p>When they learned that the children in Zhou Wen’s city were born at the Legendary or even Epic stage, how many people would rack their brains to come up with ways to enter his city to have babies?</p>
<p>Just this point alone was sufficient for Zhou Wen to gather a large number of human experts. Even if those human experts weren’t willing to join Zhou Wen’s city, he could take the opportunity to earn large amounts of benefits. He could even exchange for resources that couldn’t be obtained with money.</p>
<p>In short, with this treasure, it was impossible for Zhou Wen not to develop his city.</p>
<p>The crux of the matter was how to find this treasure. Also, he had to find a safe place to build a city and prevent easy entry.</p>
<p>I’ll do a search first. If there aren’t any treasures, it’s useless no matter how much I fantasize. Zhou Wen pondered for a moment and took out a tiny beast from the chaos space.</p>
<p>The little beast looked like a cross between a ferret and a rat, with a squirrel-like tail. It looked very strange.</p>
<p>The origins of this little beast were not simple. Previously, Tai Sui was bitten out of the metal walnut by this little beast. Furthermore, it could replicate a weapon like the Orchid Blade with identical material and effects. It was very magical.</p>
<p>Back when Zhou Wen obtained this little beast, he had kept it in the chaos space. His subsequent research on its origins came up to nothing.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen knew the beast’s abilities very well. It had a rare Earth Escape technique and was good at finding treasures.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen had no choice but to try using it.</p>
<p>After all, he had raised it for so many years. This little beast’s feral nature had decreased dramatically. It was considered close to Zhou Wen, but it was a little too cunning. Zhou Wen wasn’t too confident in its loyalty.</p>
<p>The moment the little beast came out, it looked around furtively. Perhaps because it hadn’t come out for a long time, it felt a little uncomfortable and appeared a little reserved.</p>
<p>However, after it sized up its surroundings, it gradually revealed its true nature and peeked everywhere.</p>
<p>“There’s a treasure in this city. If you can find it, we’ll split the treasure equally. In addition, I’ll give you a Mythical Companion Egg as a reward.” Zhou Wen first promised the little beast benefits.</p>
<p>The little beast wasn’t his Companion Beast, nor was it as loyal as Chick. It was difficult to entice it without offering some benefits.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, the little beast stood up like a human and gestured at him with its two tiny paws.</p>
<p>Its actions were very simple. It extended its claws and flipped back and forth several times.</p>
<p>“You want twenty? Isn’t that a little too greedy? My final offer is two,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>However, the little beast was very insistent. It waved its claws and gestured twenty again. It refused to give in at all.</p>
<p>“Three… Four… Five… Ten…” Zhou Wen kept raising the price, but the little beast was very willful. It didn’t lower its asking price at all. It kept at twenty.</p>
<p>“Fine, twenty it is. However, the thing you find has to be the one I want. You can’t randomly find something to fool me,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>The little beast nodded and looked around for a while. It sniffed the air and ran off in a certain direction.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly followed the little beast and watched it sniff around. It looked like a police hound.</p>
<p>After leaving the cemetery, the people on the streets immediately prostrated themselves at the ‘Devil King’ when they saw Zhou Wen. Wherever Zhou Wen went, people knelt on the ground, making him uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The little beast didn’t care much. It circled the city randomly.. After circling for a while, it actually headed for a cliff.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1551'>Chapter 1551: Digging Up a Treasure</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen came from the cliff—across the cliff was Lost Paradise. He had previously observed the cliff and didn’t discover anything amiss.</p>
<p>However, the little beast ran firmly towards the edge of the cliff, leaving Zhou Wen somewhat puzzled. Could it be that the treasure is at the bottom of the cliff?</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen dispelled this thought because the little beast stopped by the cliff and sniffed a stone.</p>
<p>Could it be that there’s something wrong with that stone? Zhou Wen’s mind locked onto the stone, but he didn’t discover any problems. It was as though it was a very ordinary mountain rock that was no different from the stones beside it.</p>
<p>“It looks like this little fellow of yours isn’t very reliable,” Grim Demon said.</p>
<p>The tiny beast seemed to understand him. It bared its teeth at Grim Demon and squealed as though it was cursing him. Zhou Wen didn’t even have the chance to answer.</p>
<p>“You can see me?” Grim Demon was slightly taken aback. He was in his Terror form, so it was impossible for others to see him without reaching the Terror grade.</p>
<p>This little beast’s level was clearly very low. It was impossible for it to be at the Terror grade. For it to see Grim Demon left him incredulous.</p>
<p>The little beast continued squealing at him, clearly able to see him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to care about them. He walked to the stone and carefully sized it up. The stone was likely an ordinary mountain rock, but there was something very strange.</p>
<p>The area around the cliff was a platform. The other parts were flat. Only this stone protruded a foot tall and its surface was very smooth from the weathering.</p>
<p>“You, come over.” Zhou Wen called out to a person kneeling not far away and asked, “Why is there a protruding stone here?”</p>
<p>The person thought for a moment and answered, “Your Devilish Excellency, this stone has been here for a long time. I don’t know when it appeared because it’s on the edge of the cliff. We usually tie a rope around it and use the rope to go down the cliff to find some edible plants and fungi.”</p>
<p>“Call your City Lord over,” Zhou Wen instructed when he saw that he couldn’t get much from him.</p>
<p>Not long after, the elder jogged over. After meeting him, he knelt again.</p>
<p>“Enough, stop prostrating. Tell me, when did this stone appear here?” Zhou Wen waved his hand to stop the elder from kneeling.</p>
<p>He wasn’t used to such etiquette to begin with, and it was a waste of time.</p>
<p>Only then did the elder stand properly and say, “Your Devilish Excellency, I’ve only heard from the elders that there was a monument erected here before Regretless City was established. As my elders didn’t know who erected it here, they didn’t dare to randomly remove it. Nothing special came out of this monument over time; therefore, from my elders onwards, they used this monument as a pillar, tying ropes to it to aid our descent to search for food.”</p>
<p>The elder paused for a moment before continuing, “Much later, due to the elements and a few accidents, the stone monument snapped. Later on, it underwent a few problems, leaving only this tiny piece in our generation. We aren’t too sure of its origins.”</p>
<p>A stone monument? Zhou Wen frowned as he looked at the protruding stone that was a foot tall. It was very difficult to associate it with a stone monument.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this monument had actually shattered. If it was really that magical, how could it shatter so easily?</p>
<p>The people from Regretless City didn’t know much about the stone. Zhou Wen waved his hand and dismissed them.</p>
<p>The tiny beast ran in front of Zhou Wen and extended its claws. From the looks of it, it was asking Zhou Wen for its Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>This fellow was like a weasel, but what it liked to eat wasn’t chicken eggs, but Companion Eggs. It loved eating the higher-level ones.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously fed it quite a number of Companion Eggs. Although their levels weren’t high and most of them were at the Epic stage, it hadn’t evolved over the years.</p>
<p>“Are you sure this stone is a treasure?” Zhou Wen asked the little beast.</p>
<p>The little beast pointed at the stone with its claws and made another digging motion.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood that the treasure wasn’t the stone, but beneath it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth and got it to dig up the stone. It was most suitable for such manual labor.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth didn’t transform into its huge form. It shrank to a height of four to five meters, extended its claws, and swiped down, slicing open the stone like tofu.</p>
<p>After moving its claws a few times, the protruding rock was dug out completely, leaving a hole more than a meter deep.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth’s claws seemed to touch something as they emitted a metallic clang.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly walked over and looked into the pit. He realized that there was a green metal object. It looked like a bronze artifact.</p>
<p>He summoned Bamboo Blade and removed the rocks beside the bronze artifact. Soon, the bronze artifact was completely exposed.</p>
<p>What’s this? Zhou Wen sized up the bronze artifact that had been taken out of the pit, but after looking at it for a while, he couldn’t figure out what it was.</p>
<p>This item looked very strange. Zhou Wen had never seen such a bronze artifact.</p>
<p>Typical bronze tools, such as tripod cauldrons, furnaces, and spoons were nothing to speak of. Even some unknown bronze artifacts looked somewhat similar.</p>
<p>However, this bronze artifact was different from the bronze artifacts Zhou Wen had seen in the past.</p>
<p>This was the first time Zhou Wen had seen a bronze artifact that looked like a radish. Furthermore, it was a short and fat radish. It was more than a meter tall. More importantly, there were three leaves at the top. It looked like a huge radish no matter how he looked at it.</p>
<p>What’s this? Could it be a radish planted in the Garden of Eden? Zhou Wen reached out and tapped it, producing a metallic sound. It was hard to tell if it was bronze.</p>
<p>There were many mysterious symbols engraved on the bronze artifact, but unfortunately, Zhou Wen didn’t know what they meant.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen increased his strength bit by bit and finally, despite using all his strength, he failed to leave a dent in the bronze artifact that looked like a radish.</p>
<p>It’s really something good. His strength was already comparable to a Human Realm creature. Even his strength couldn’t damage it. Just the material’s worth alone was definitely something good.</p>
<p>The radishes planted in the Garden of Eden are indeed extraordinary. Zhou Wen didn’t store the bronze artifact in the chaos space. Instead, he got Grim Demon to guard it.</p>
<p>He wanted to see if there were any problems with it to prevent himself from bringing trouble back.</p>
<p>“Is that all there is here? Are there any other treasures?” Zhou Wen turned to ask the little beast.</p>
<p>The little beast hesitated for a moment and looked in the direction of the cemetery.. In the end, it shook its head as though it was afraid of something.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1552'>Chapter 1552: Four Dinosaurs Battling the Ravenous Wolf</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Upon seeing the little beast’s actions, Zhou Wen knew that it had definitely discovered the two puppets in the grave. However, from its appearance, it was difficult to tell if the puppets were a blessing or a curse.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked back, but the tiny beast didn’t leave. It circled the bronze artifact many times, but it didn’t lunge forward.</p>
<p>Could it be that there’s something inside this radish-like bronze artifact? Zhou Wen guessed.</p>
<p>Previously, the little beast had gnawed the metal walnut, producing Tai Sui. If this radish was the same as the metal walnut, there might be a Companion Beast inside. That would be interesting.</p>
<p>However, the reason the little beast could bite through the metal walnut in the past was that it wasn’t too hard. Zhou Wen couldn’t even leave a dent in this thing, so it was impossible for the little beast to bite through it.</p>
<p>Therefore, although the little beast was very greedy, it didn’t want to take the bronze artifact for itself. It was probably because it couldn’t bite through it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if the bronze artifact had anything to do with how the people in Regretless City were born at the Legendary or Epic stage, but other than that, he couldn’t find anything else. He couldn’t really tear down Regretless City, right?</p>
<p>Even if he dug three feet deep, he might not be able to find any treasures. This was because Zhou Wen might not even recognize a treasure when he saw one.</p>
<p>Those that could glow weren’t necessarily treasures. Most likely, it was an electric lamp. Even if it sounded by itself, it might not be a treasure. It was also possible that it was a phone. Finding treasures was a technical job. It was useless looking at its appearance. One had to understand its nature.</p>
<p>After returning to the city, before Zhou Wen could walk back to the cemetery, he saw the Cube in the middle of the street vibrate. The screen lit up and the scene of Dubhe Palace appeared.</p>
<p>Another person is challenging the Star Palace? Zhou Wen stopped in front of the Cube to take a look.</p>
<p>There were only two names on the rankings now. One was Saint Jiuyang, and the other was Fire-Armored God from before. They had only chosen to challenge Dubhe Palace. After passing, they didn’t head for the next Star Palace.</p>
<p>This time, a triceratops appeared in Dubhe Palace. It was silver-white in color, as though it was made of white gold. As its body was too heavy, the ground seemed to tremble with every step it took.</p>
<p>The triceratops on Earth should be vegetarians, right? Zhou Wen muttered inwardly.</p>
<p>Before he could continue thinking, he saw another dinosaur appear. It was a pterosaur. Its entire body was golden, like a flying golden statue.</p>
<p>Following that, two more dinosaurs appeared. One looked like a tyrannosaurus, while the other looked like a stegosaurus. The tyrannosaurus looked like black iron, and the stegosaurus looked like it was made of bronze.</p>
<p>The appearance of the four dinosaurs immediately attracted the attention of many people.</p>
<p>“Where do these dinosaurs come from? Isn’t it said that dinosaurs went extinct a long time ago?”</p>
<p>“They are definitely not dinosaurs from Earth.”</p>
<p>“These four dinosaurs look very strong.”</p>
<p>As everyone was discussing, the triceratops had already taken the lead and rushed over to slam open Dubhe Palace’s door.</p>
<p>The four dinosaurs charged into Dubhe Palace together. When Starlord Ravenous Wolf saw them, he threw a punch as a terrifying blast of light shone on them.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, they actually survived!” Everyone was alarmed. The four dinosaurs had actually survived the damage from the light blast. Furthermore, they didn’t rush towards the teleportation nexus, but towards Starlord Ravenous Wolf.</p>
<p>A huge battle immediately broke out in the Star Palace. The four dinosaurs attacked Starlord Ravenous Wolf who was no weakling. Although the blast of light failed to kill the four dinosaurs, his speed and strength weren’t inferior to the four dinosaurs. Despite fighting four alone, he remained impressive and wasn’t at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Although the Cube allowed ordinary people to see battles between high-level creatures in the past, human eyesight couldn’t keep up with the speed of the battle. In fact, when it really began, all the average person saw was shimmering light, not the exact scenes of the battle.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched with relish. The four dinosaurs were clearly at the Human Realm, one level lower than Starlord Ravenous Wolf. However, their abilities were very special. They used four different Calamity Zones to cooperate with each other. Together with the various skills they were good at, they were actually able to fight the Hell-level Starlord Ravenous Wolf without being at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>They even had a slight advantage. If they continued fighting, they might really have a chance of defeating Starlord Ravenous Wolf.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was apparent that the four dinosaurs had extremely high intelligence. it was obvious that these fellows were even cleverer than most humans from the way they cooperated.</p>
<p>The pterosaur ‘s attack was as fast as lightning, but Zhou Wen paid more attention to its Calamity Zone. It seemed to be a wind-elemental domain. In its domain, the speed of the four dinosaurs increased. They were actually comparable to the Hell-level Starlord Ravenous Wolf.</p>
<p>The triceratops’s Calamity Zone was very strange. After watching for a while, Zhou Wen could only tell that it was likely a power similar to a gravity domain. It greatly limited Starlord Ravenous Wolf, making it difficult for him to make full use of his advantage.</p>
<p>The tyrannosaurus’s Calamity Zone increased the offensive strength of the four dinosaurs. The stegosaurus’s Calamity Zone was a recovery-type Calamity Zone. Once the four dinosaurs were injured, they would quickly heal under the influence of the stegosaurus’s Calamity Zone.</p>
<p>The stegosaurus’s Calamity Zone played a huge role in allowing the four dinosaurs to withstand the blast of light.</p>
<p>Under the combined forces of the four Human Realm dinosaurs, Starlord Ravenous Wolf, who was at the Hell level, was restrained.</p>
<p>This was also the first time Zhou Wen had seen Starlord Ravenous Wolf fight. When he had been in the middle of the battle, he couldn’t see anything. He didn’t know how Starlord Ravenous Wolf and the Golden Wyrm Scissors fought. All he knew was that the Golden Wyrm Scissors had snipped off Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s head.</p>
<p>Now, after watching Starlord Ravenous Wolf fight, he realized that this fellow was crazy. He was very strong in every aspect. His entire body was almost a combat weapon. He was an existence that could even kill someone with his buttocks.</p>
<p>Just any random move by Starlord Ravenous Wolf was a unique move that ordinary people could spend their entire lives studying and practicing.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Wen was inspired when he saw it. Starlord Ravenous Wolf was like a martial arts library.</p>
<p>In a one-on-one battle, unless it’s a fellow like the Golden Wyrm Scissors who can’t be killed in one strike, it’s really difficult to defeat Starlord Ravenous Wolf. Zhou Wen had to admit that Starlord Ravenous Wolf was too powerful in combat.</p>
<p>Its only weakness was that it was easily restricted by external forces. Just like the triceratops’s gravity domain, it restrained him greatly, making it difficult for him to unleash his full strength.</p>
<p>What a pity. Even the strong can’t beat a numbers game. No matter how strong an individual is, they ultimately can’t defeat a team. For some reason, Zhou Wen hoped that Starlord Ravenous Wolf would win.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the miracle didn’t happen.. With the cooperation of the four dinosaurs, after fighting for more than thirty hours, the triceratops’s long horn pierced through Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s chest.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1553'>Chapter 1553: Domain Stacking</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s corpse was quickly torn apart by the four dinosaurs. A purple dimensional crystal dropped and was swallowed by the tyrannosaurus. It was impossible to see what crystal it was.</p>
<p>After the four dinosaurs killed Starlord Ravenous Wolf, they roared at the sky and rushed into the teleportation nexus before disappearing.</p>
<p>They didn’t choose to enter the next Star Palace either. Instead, they left. The Cube’s screen returned to the Cube’s ranking.</p>
<p>The first place which was originally occupied by Saint Jiuyang was now occupied by the name ‘Four Dinosaur Kings.’ Saint Jiuyang and Fire-Armored God were ranked second and third.</p>
<p>“These fellows are really dinosaurs. Could they be dinosaurs that left Earth?”</p>
<p>“It’s really possible. It’s a mystery why the dinosaurs went extinct on Earth. Perhaps the dinosaurs didn’t go extinct at all. They only evolved to a certain extent and rushed out of Earth to enter a Universe Era.”</p>
<p>“In that case, how many dinosaurs are there in the universe?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you find it strange? Previously, in the Venusian dimensional zone, every clearer obtained a metal Companion Egg, but these clearers didn’t seem to obtain anything?”</p>
<p>Someone discovered the crux of the problem. Just this comment was quickly drowned by the news regarding the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>The various families also saw new hope from these dinosaurs. Through the cooperation of various domains, they could actually kill Starlord Ravenous Wolf. This was clearly a shortcut.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also very interested in the cooperation of such domains. He was the owner of multiple domains, so he had been studying how to maximize the effects of his various abilities.</p>
<p>However, this was because the Essence Energy Arts he cultivated had their own characteristics. Although it wasn’t that he couldn’t have them working together, they lacked in synergy. Typically, he matched a few abilities such as Godfiend Era and the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art.</p>
<p>However, once he obtained the Calamity Zone, things might turn for the better.</p>
<p>The stacking of multiple domains might have unexpected benefits.</p>
<p>Apart from the Chaos Egg’s Calamity Zone that’s inconvenient to stack, the other domains should be able to stack. I have to think of a way to get those dimensional zones out as soon as possible. Perhaps I can kill Starlord Ravenous Wolf at the Terror grade via stacking them. Zhou Wen thought to himself about how he could get the other Essence Energy Arts to produce a domain.</p>
<p>The First Order of Chaos and the Ancient Sovereign Sutra have already condensed domains. Among the remaining Essence Energy Arts, the ones that are easier to match with dimensional zones should be the Dao Sutra and the Demon God Bloodline Catalog. The Dao Sutra comes from Mount Laojun, while the Demon God Bloodline Catalog comes from Chess Mountain. They have a clear origin. Presumably, the opportunity for them to advance to the Calamity Zone lies in these two places. Unfortunately, the dimensional creatures in these two places are too powerful. I’m still unable to clear them up to now. It will probably be very difficult to find the key object to condense a domain. Zhou Wen had no choice but to temporarily give up on the two Essence Energy Arts.</p>
<p>Of the remaining Essence Energy Arts, Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art came from the Endless Sea of Stars. However, despite repeatedly grinding the Endless Sea of Stars, Zhou Wen failed to find any key objects.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the Endless Sea of Stars was just too huge. It was unknown how long it would take to traverse its entirety. Finding something inside was no different from finding a needle in a haystack. The difficulty was in no way inferior to Chess Mountain and Mount Laojun.</p>
<p>The Godfiend Era and Qi Refinement Art didn’t have any corresponding dimensional zones for the time being. Zhou Wen had also gone to the Small Buddha Temple corresponding to the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra many times, but he failed to find the key object needed to advance to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen felt that he could continue searching Small Buddha Temple. After all, that place was relatively small. If there was really something that could advance to the Calamity grade, the chances of finding it were higher.</p>
<p>He could also give the Qi Refinement Art a shot. It probably wouldn’t be easy to find a dimensional zone that corresponded to the Godfiend Era, but with the Qi Refinement Art, Zhou Wen already had a goal in mind.</p>
<p>Although the Qi Refinement Art was mainly focused on Qi Refinement, everyone had different cultivation directions. They determined the huge differences amongst people despite being the same Qi Refinement Art.</p>
<p>Taking Zhou Wen’s Qi Refinement Art as an example, the Life Soul he condensed was a sword, while Hui Wan condensed an AI that resembled a phone. They were two completely different things, and the subsequent styles would deviate further.</p>
<p>With his current insights, Zhou Wen felt that his Qi Refinement Art was actually rather suitable for the Ancient Sword Tomb. He wanted to go to the Ancient Sword Tomb to see if he could condense a domain with the Qi Refinement Art.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen had a goal in mind. He wasn’t speaking without reason.</p>
<p>In the Ancient Sword Tomb, there was a sword that Zhou Wen had been unable to pull out. Furthermore, every time Zhou Wen pulled out the sword, the entire Ancient Sword Tomb would tremble as though all the swords were about to fly out by themselves.</p>
<p>It was a grayish-black vine sword embedded in a small mound. Zhou Wen had been unable to pull it out when his level was low. He still failed to pull it out when he reached the Terror grade.</p>
<p>He didn’t make any attempts after that. If it wasn’t for the problem of the Qi Refinement Sword, Zhou Wen would have forgotten about pulling out the sword.</p>
<p>Now, he suspected that the vine sword was likely the core of the Ancient Sword Tomb, the key to advancing to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Of course, this was only Zhou Wen’s guess. Even if the vine sword was really the core of the Ancient Sword Tomb, it was still a question if it could match his Qi Refinement Art.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if it was an item that could allow him to advance to the Calamity grade. Perhaps it was because it was too powerful that he couldn’t pull it out.</p>
<p>He came to the Ancient Sword Tomb again. It had been a long time since Zhou Wen had grinded there. He found it somewhat unfamiliar.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen’s memory wasn’t bad. He quickly found the tiny grave. The vine sword embedded in it was the same as before. It looked like a withered vine had been stabbed into it.</p>
<p>I hope it works. Otherwise, I really don’t know where I can find a dimensional zone that matches the Qi Refinement Art. Although Zhou Wen also wanted to go to the Founding Emperor Tomb, there was nothing there that matched Qi Refinement Arts, much less something that matched the Qi Refinement Art that Zhou Wen cultivated. He felt that the chances were very slim.</p>
<p>He came in front of the vine sword and circulated the Qi Refinement Art. Immediately, sword beams seeped out from his body. The Sword Pill condensed from Essence Energy also emitted sword intent in his consciousness.</p>
<p>With a thought from Zhou Wen, Sword Pill immediately transformed into something very similar to the Immortal Culling Sword. The sword intent on the sword became even sharper and more ferocious.</p>
<p>With a terrifying sword aura and sword intent, Zhou Wen reached out to grab the hilt of the vine sword. He immediately exerted strength, hoping to pull the vine sword out of the tiny grave.</p>
<p>The vine sword was originally grayish-black and withered, making it look like a dead vine.. Now that Zhou Wen was pulling at it, the vine sword emitted a strange sword intent that resembled a blooming flower.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1554'>Chapter 1554: Pulling out the Sword</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen pulled up the vine sword inch by inch. The sword intent on the vine sword became stronger and stronger. It began to spew out fireworks. In the end, it was like a volcanic eruption that nearly tore through the sky.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was a swordsman himself and was proficient in the three thousand sword intents, but he had never seen the vine sword’s sword intent.</p>
<p>Instead of calling it a sword intent, it was more like a concept of life.</p>
<p>Rumble!</p>
<p>The entire Ancient Sword Tomb shook as countless swords hummed above the grave, as though they would fly out at any moment, heading straight for Zhou Wen who was pulling at the sword.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised as he looked at the Ancient Sword Tomb that was shaking and surging with sword beams. He was delighted because the vine sword was likely the core of the Ancient Sword Tomb. Perhaps the Qi Refinement Art had a chance of advancing to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>However, from the looks of the Ancient Sword Tomb’s situation, if all the swords really tore out of the grave and attacked Zhou Wen, he might not be able to handle the countless swords while pulling at the sword.</p>
<p>Amitabha. Please bless me to pull out the vine sword safely. Before I advance to the Calamity grade, don’t let those swords come out, Zhou Wen prayed inwardly.</p>
<p>However, the worst of his fears happened. Halfway through pulling the vine sword, Zhou Wen suddenly heard a crisp and dull sword hum. It was like the sound of thousands of swords being unsheathed in a kill zone.</p>
<p>Oh no! Zhou Wen cursed inwardly as he took a glance. Indeed, he saw the swords in the grave fly out and float in the sky like a sea of stars. At a glance, the sky was filled with resplendent sword beams. He couldn’t see the end, nor did he know how many swords there were.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen took a glance, he saw the swords that filled the sky had their tips pointed at him from all directions.</p>
<p>At that instant, Zhou Wen suddenly felt as though the entire world was his enemy. The feeling of being alone and helpless left him shuddering in fear.</p>
<p>Without any pause, all the swords erupted with all sorts of sword auras, sword beams, and sword intents. The sword beams that filled the sky intertwined and rained down from above.</p>
<p>At this point, Zhou Wen couldn’t give up. All he could do was continue pulling at the sword as he prepared to withstand the onslaught of the swords.</p>
<p>“Activate!” Zhou Wen activated the First Order of Chaos domain. Glimmering words appeared and enveloped his body, forming the shape of a Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Inside the Chaos Egg, Zhou Wen held the hilt with both hands as he pulled upwards with all his might. Outside, countless swords rained down on the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!</p>
<p>It was better to die in glory than live in dishonor—the swords seemed to have the determination to destroy indiscriminately. They used all their strength to slam into the Chaos Egg, not sparing themselves at all.</p>
<p>The low-level swords slammed into the Chaos Egg and shattered. The high-level swords slammed into it and drilled in with all their might until their bodies collapsed under the immense pressure.</p>
<p>Sword beams rained down in waves, crazily striking the Chaos Egg as large amounts of solid Essence Energy condensed inside.</p>
<p>If it were the Chaos Egg before it advanced to the Calamity grade, it would have long exploded. Thankfully, after advancing to the Calamity grade, the Essence Energy Crystals in it could be stacked, so he wasn’t worried about it exploding.</p>
<p>I’m still one-third away from pulling it out. From the looks of it, I should be able to withstand it, Zhou Wen thought to himself as he pulled. Although the sword attacks outside were ferocious, they weren’t enough to break through the Chaos Egg’s defense.</p>
<p>While having this thought, he suddenly heard a tearing sound. A sword blade pierced through the Chaos Egg’s outer shell before a portion of the sword stabbed into Zhou Wen’s chest.</p>
<p>If not for the Chaos Egg blocking most of its strength, Zhou Wen’s chest would have been penetrated.</p>
<p>Even though the Chaos Egg blocked most of the blade’s strength, a terrifying sword beam still rushed out of the blade and wreaked havoc in Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>The sword beam was extremely terrifying. Apart from the Immortal Culling Sword, Zhou Wen had never seen such a violent sword beam. The moment the sword beam entered his body, it immediately spread out like a virus, wanting to destroy all the cells in his body, in a bid to not even leave ashes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly circulated the Qi Refinement Art and condensed sword beams to resist the terrifying destructive sword beams.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s sword beams were considered extremely condensed against sword beams at the same level. As they were constantly compressed from Essence Energy, it was very difficult for ordinary sword beams to withstand Zhou Wen’s.</p>
<p>However, when compared to the destructive sword beams, Zhou Wen’s sword beams appeared somewhat lacking in precision. It was like the difference between tempered steel and ordinary raw metal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s sword beams retreated in defeat as his cells were constantly destroyed. His body couldn’t withstand such terrifying sword beams after his sword beams collapsed.</p>
<p>And this is with the Chaos Egg blocking most of the force. There’s actually such a terrifying sword in the Ancient Sword Tomb? Zhou Wen was alarmed. Thankfully, this was in-game. If it was in reality, he would have long abandoned the sword and fled. He wouldn’t have the time to pull out the sword.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was still willing to take the risk in-game. He gathered all his strength and suddenly exerted all his strength to pull out the sword. He wanted to pull out the vine sword before he was destroyed.</p>
<p>Only a small portion of the vine sword remained in the grave. The blood-colored avatar’s chest collapsed at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>Outside the Chaos Egg, the thousands of swords continued attacking crazily. Although Zhou Wen knew that even if he pulled out the vine sword, it would be difficult for him to escape death, he still wanted to see if there was a chance of advancing to the Calamity grade after pulling it out.</p>
<p>Will I die first, or will I pull out the vine sword first? Zhou Wen could sense that the flesh on the blood-colored avatar’s chest had almost completely collapsed. Thankfully, his physique was sufficiently powerful. If it were an ordinary person, they would have long died.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Wen’s body was at its limits. The game could go black at any moment.</p>
<p>At the instant Zhou Wen thought he was about to die, he finally pulled out the vine sword. As he had used so much strength, he ended up lifting it above his head.</p>
<p>The extremely powerful sword intent on the vine sword exploded like a nuclear bomb at that instant.</p>
<p>Wherever the sword intent passed, the thousands of swords that were attacking Zhou Wen seemed to lose their souls as they fell like snowflakes.</p>
<p>Even the sword embedded in Zhou Wen’s chest strangely and slowly retreated.</p>
<p>The sword beams that could destroy everything receded like a tidal wave as the blade pulled out of Zhou Wen’s chest and left the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>In the next second, the sword intent emitted by the vine sword surged towards the Sword Pill that Zhou Wen had condensed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1555'>Chapter 1555: It’s Not What I Want</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The sword intent from the vine sword surged into Sword Pill, shattering all of Sword Pill’s three thousand sword intents.</p>
<p>Sword Pill that had already transformed into the Immortal Culling Sword gradually returned to its sword pill form.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt as though Sword Pill had turned into a huge furnace. Its three thousand sword intents seemed to melt as they gradually fused into one.</p>
<p>And what melted the three thousand sword intents into one was the sword intent on the vine sword.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t sense any sword aura from the vine sword from beginning to end, but its sword intent was unimaginably powerful.</p>
<p>He had never seen a sword intent this powerful. Even without the sword aura, just the sword intent alone could probably affect one’s heart.</p>
<p>As the sword intent constantly fused, Zhou Wen sensed that Sword Pill had begun to evolve and condense a domain.</p>
<p>However, this domain was condensed rather strangely. It was a pure sword intent domain without any sword auras participating.</p>
<p>A pure sword intent domain? Is that really good? Zhou Wen wore an odd expression, unsure if it was suitable for him.</p>
<p>The Qi Refinement Art was clearly an Essence Energy Art that focused on cultivating Essence Energy, but the Calamity Zone that condensed was a pure sword intent domain.</p>
<p>No matter what Zhou Wen thought, the Qi Refinement Art didn’t have synergy with such a domain.</p>
<p>As the sword intent in the vine sword fused into Sword Pill, the vine sword itself began to shatter, turning into scattering dust.</p>
<p>The thousands of swords in the Ancient Sword Tomb fell to the ground like subjects who worshiped their monarch. Only a few swords returned to the Sword Tomb without trembling like the other swords.</p>
<p>This included the sword that had pierced through the Chaos Egg and nearly killed Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t see this. He was pondering if such a domain was what he needed.</p>
<p>Pure sword intent domains weren’t bad. As long as a domain existed, it had to have a reason for its existence. Zhou Wen was considering if such a domain suited himself and the Qi Refinement Art.</p>
<p>The domain was slowly taking form. Zhou Wen could already sense how powerful it was. Just the nascent domain had made thousands of swords submit.</p>
<p>Most of the swords in the sword intent domain had lost their effects. If someone were to fight Zhou Wen with a sword in hand, the sword in the enemy’s hands would suddenly lose the effects they originally had. It would be too easy for Zhou Wen to defeat his opponent.</p>
<p>Such a domain was very strong, but Zhou Wen felt that it wasn’t the domain he needed.</p>
<p>Perhaps others might find it satisfying to enfeeble their opponent, thereby crushing them, but Zhou Wen didn’t like that.</p>
<p>Even if he wanted to defeat his opponent, Zhou Wen hoped to defeat an opponent at peak condition and not an opponent whose ability to resist had been stripped away. That would only make Zhou Wen find it boring.</p>
<p>This isn’t the domain I want. Zhou Wen already understood what he really wanted.</p>
<p>However, how could he reverse the domain that was forming? Zhou Wen didn’t know. He had never had such experience, nor did he know if he could change the domain that was taking form.</p>
<p>If it were in reality, Zhou Wen would only wait for the domain to be completed. It would be equivalent to courting death to do something at such a critical stage.</p>
<p>However, in-game, no matter how much nonsense he did, he would only die. He could revive from a drop of blood.</p>
<p>At most, I’ll fail at condensing a domain. I’d rather fail than have a domain I don’t like. Zhou Wen steeled his resolve as his strength erupted crazily. He forcefully stopped the transmission of sword intent, hoping to throw out the remaining half of the vine sword.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s desperate attempt failed to throw out the vine sword. Instead, his sword intent clashed with the broken sword’s sword intent.</p>
<p>The Sword Pill, that was already on track and was fusing to form a domain, instantly warped. The sword intent domain that had already been produced began to collapse.</p>
<p>Thousands of swords that had already submitted to the ground gradually raised their tips again. As though they were attracted by a magnet, their tips pointed at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The domain constantly collapsed as the swords gradually floated up again, surrounding Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Once Zhou Wen’s incomplete domain completely collapsed, the swords would kill him just like before.</p>
<p>So what if I die? It’s better than having a domain I don’t like. It’s best if you kill me quickly to prevent the domain from condensing successfully. Zhou Wen wanted the domain to collapse faster, but now, all sorts of sword intents were running amok in his body as though he had been possessed. He couldn’t even control his body, so there was no chance of dying even if he wanted to.</p>
<p>The vine sword’s sword intent was still gushing in, but the sword intent in Sword Pill was flowing out and surging into Zhou Wen’s body. The sword intent originally formed from three thousand sword intents had already become countless fragments that were about to fuse into one after being struck by the vine sword’s intent.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, when the three thousand sword intents completely fused with the vine sword intent, it would be when the domain was successfully condensed.</p>
<p>When that happened, all the sword intents would no longer be distinguishable. They would become one, having no effect on Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, after the three thousand sword intents were shattered while in an incomplete fused state, all sorts of sword intent fragments rushed out and affected Zhou Wen’s mind.</p>
<p>It felt like a movie’s editing had gone wrong. An action movie, a romance movie, a wuxia movie, a science fiction movie had been edited and stitched together. Scenes would switch to completely unrelated scenes when played. It was a confusing sight.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s firm willpower thankfully prevented him from being affected by the psychedelic sword intent.</p>
<p>However, as the vine sword intent surged in, Zhou Wen realized that the sword intent fragments seemed to slowly return to their previous trajectories. It was as though they were about to begin condensing a domain again.</p>
<p>No, you can’t do that! Zhou Wen attempted to use his mental strength to control the sword intent fragments. He didn’t have a certain goal—he just wanted to mess things up.</p>
<p>It wasn’t easy to stop the domain from condensing, but Zhou Wen thought that as long as he could restrain the vine sword’s sword intent and prevent the domain from taking form, he could wait for the swords to kill him.</p>
<p>At that moment, the swords in the Ancient Sword Tomb had already flown up again and were aimed at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>With a hum, thousands of swords shot out at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Here they come! Zhou Wen was overjoyed. He didn’t have a Chaos Egg around him now. The swords would probably be able to kill him very quickly if they attacked, so it was impossible for him to condense the Calamity Zone successfully.</p>
<p>Just as the thousands of swords rushed in front of Zhou Wen who was already awaiting death with his eyes closed, his face filled with a smile, something unexpected happened.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1556'>Chapter 1556: No Submission</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The remaining half of the vine sword in Zhou Wen’s hand suddenly became even more terrifying. It was as though a sword emperor had descended. The terrifying sword intent pressure instantly caused the thousands of swords in the Ancient Sword Tomb to fall to the ground. Some swords couldn’t even withstand the pressure of the sword intent as they constantly trembled and shattered with a bang.</p>
<p>The few swords that weren’t affected by the vine sword trembled non-stop. Sword hums sounded incessantly as though they were competing for supremacy.</p>
<p>An ancient sword that was originally unmoved exploded inside the grave. The ancient sword also fell from the exploded grave and hit the ground, motionless. Like a subject prostrating in worship, the other swords began to shake.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt the sword intent the most directly. He could clearly sense that it wanted to bring its will into Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy Art and form a Calamity Zone that was completely compatible with it.</p>
<p>The sword intent that had already been thrown into disarray in Zhou Wen’s body was rapidly restoring order under the intense restraints of the vine sword intent. It began building the Calamity Zone again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was a stubborn person. Now that the vine sword was forcefully condensing a Calamity Zone, how could he accept it?</p>
<p>Since I can’t use the power of those swords to commit suicide, I’ll kill myself. With a thought, the Golden Wyrm Scissors immediately flew out and transformed into a golden beam that snipped at the blood-colored avatar’s head.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The halved vine sword moved autonomously and blocked the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ strike. A powerful Hell-level weapon like the Golden Wyrm Scissors could slice apart creatures of the same level, but it was blocked by the halved vine sword and failed to continue its snip.</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrm Scissors attacked a second time after failing to deliver a conclusive strike, but the halved vine sword was extremely magical. It blocked the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ attack again and again. Even if the Golden Wyrm Scissors slashed at it with all its might, it was still blocked by the vine sword.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried his best to control his hands, but it was useless. Under the influence of the vine sword, his hands involuntarily moved with the vine sword, blocking the Golden Wyrm Scissors again and again.</p>
<p>As for the sword intent fragments in Zhou Wen’s body, they were gradually sucked back into Sword Pill.</p>
<p>“Even if you are really a sword immortal from the heavens, you can’t force me to do something I don’t like.” Seeing that the Golden Wyrm Scissors couldn’t be used, Zhou Wen summoned all his pets.</p>
<p>If people were to see so many high-level Companion Beasts, they would probably be extremely envious and jealous. However, they would probably be shell-shocked to see the Companion Beasts desperately attacking their master.</p>
<p>Perhaps many people had never seen Companion Beasts attack their master in their lives.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s various Companion Beasts—Golden Wyrm Scissors, Golden Sniper, Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, Golden Battle God, Tyrant Behemoth, and so on—were summoned by Zhou Wen as long as they were above the Terror grade. He made them attack him with all their might.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>However, the vine sword was invincible. It blocked all the attacks from so many Companion Beasts and even killed many of them.</p>
<p>The Golden Sniper’s bullet shattered as the Golden Battle God was instantly parted at its waist. Tyrant Behemoth, who had just advanced to the Calamity grade, was forced back hundreds of meters by the strike despite using Absolute Strength and Overlord Zone.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, what the hell is this vine sword? Is it that powerful? It wasn’t that Zhou Wen had never seen a ferocious dimensional creature, but he had never seen one as ferocious as the vine sword.</p>
<p>The vine sword seemed determined to fuse into Zhou Wen’s Calamity Zone. The shocking sword intent raged out, causing the Companion Beasts to retreat.</p>
<p>I really don’t believe it. It’s not easy to live, but can it be difficult to die? Zhou Wen summoned the Ancient Splitting Spore and made it explode in his body. Doctor Darkness attached himself to Zhou Wen in his soul form, but he didn’t help him fight. Instead, he spread poison within Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, their levels were a little low, so they failed to severely injure Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t dead, but due to the explosion of the Ancient Splitting Spore, Zhou Wen’s body suffered a serious shock. The Qi Refinement Art that was circulating immediately lost its Essence Energy, causing Sword Pill to lose control.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Soul Mirror’s Soul-Suppression Divine Light shone on the vine sword, causing a black halo to appear over it. It looked like it had played a certain role.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, Zhou Wen’s body was driven by the vine sword. He appeared in front of the Soul Mirror as though he had instant transmitted and shattered it with one strike.</p>
<p>This fellow is a little afraid of the Soul Mirror? Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>After fighting for so long, the vine sword only guided Zhou Wen’s arm to fight, killing or repelling any Companion Beasts that approached.</p>
<p>That was done with Zhou Wen standing in the same spot previously. Only when the Soul Mirror’s Soul-Suppression Divine Light descended did the vine sword take the initiative to attack. It was somewhat different from the passive battle from before.</p>
<p>The Soul Mirror was shattered by it. I don’t have a second Companion Beast of the same type. Even if I know that the vine sword is afraid of the Soul Mirror’s power, I don’t have any means to restrain it. Could it be that it’s really condensing a domain just like that? Zhou Wen was depressed.</p>
<p>He no longer had any other means to use. His body was controlled, and his Companion Beasts couldn’t defeat the vine sword. All he could do was condense the domain.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen believed that the outcome was set and that there was no way to reverse the situation, a sword flew over.</p>
<p>Strange, why would a sword fly over at such a time? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>As the vine sword’s sword intent was so powerful, it suppressed all the swords, preventing them from even moving. None of them dared to approach Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, the sword didn’t seem to be suppressed by the vine sword’s sword intent. It flew straight at Zhou Wen and with an unsheathing sound, the sword flew out of its scabbard and stabbed at Zhou Wen’s chest.</p>
<p>That’s… Son of Heaven’s Three Swords… Zhou Wen was alarmed. The sword that flew over was actually the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords that Zhou Wen hadn’t been able to pull out.</p>
<p>Although the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords was only at the Terror grade, Zhou Wen had yet to pull it out to date. Now that it had unsheathed itself, how could Zhou Wen not be alarmed?</p>
<p>Something’s amiss! Previously, when I used it against enemies, I couldn’t pull it out no matter what. Now that I’m letting it kill me, it actually unsheathed itself. What the hell is this? Zhou Wen, who was supposed to be pleasantly surprised, became even more depressed when he thought of this.</p>
<p>The Son of Heaven’s Three Swords was formed from the fusion of Light Concealment, Shadow Concealment, and Night Immaculate. However, it didn’t seem to have inherited the ability of invisibility from the three swords. It was always visible with the scabbard.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords didn’t have the ability to turn invisible, but when he saw it unsheathed, he realized that he couldn’t see its blade.. All he felt was a powerful sword intent condense in front of the hilt, stabbing sharply at Zhou Wen’s chest.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1557'>Chapter 1557: Works Hard At Killing Master</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The Son of Heaven’s Three Swords’ offensive strength wasn’t very strong among Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts. The Golden Wyrm Scissors’ attack was far stronger than it. Even among Terror-grade Companion Beasts, there were many that were stronger than it.</p>
<p>However, the vine sword actually clashed with the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords first. The vine sword struck the body of the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords and sent it flying.</p>
<p>When the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords flew out, Zhou Wen realized that something was amiss. He saw the thousands of swords that had been suppressed by the vine swords slowly fly up.</p>
<p>However, in the past, the swords had flown independently without any pattern. The only similarity had been their target.</p>
<p>But now, it was somewhat different. The swords were clearly centered around the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords. No matter how one looked at it, they seemed to be controlled by it.</p>
<p>Hum!</p>
<p>With the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords hum, the thousands of swords ignored the sword intent pressure of the vine sword and charged at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was at a loss whether to laugh or cry. The Son of Heaven’s Three Swords was indeed working hard to carry out his orders, but when Zhou Wen fought the enemy in the past, it had never helped him. Now that Zhou Wen wanted to commit suicide, it was putting in so much effort.</p>
<p>This was the first time Zhou Wen knew that the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords could control other swords.</p>
<p>More ridiculous was the ancient sword that had dropped previously. It was probably at the Calamity grade—a level higher than the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords. Logically speaking, it shouldn’t be controlled by the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords.</p>
<p>Yet, the ancient sword charged at Zhou Wen with the other swords.</p>
<p>There were also a few other swords of similar strength that rushed over.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>As the vine sword fought the Golden Wyrm Scissors and other Companion Beasts, it had to withstand the bombardment of thousands of swords. The situation immediately became terrible.</p>
<p>Even something as powerful as the vine sword couldn’t gain the upper hand under such circumstances. Zhou Wen also began to suffer injuries.</p>
<p>The Son of Heaven’s Three Swords levitated there motionless as the swords charged forward without any regard for their lives.</p>
<p>Faster! Or it’ll be too late! Zhou Wen felt that the domain in his body was about to be completed. It would be useless if he was killed after its completion.</p>
<p>However, the swords had already used all their strength, but they still failed to kill Zhou Wen. They had only injured some unimportant spots.</p>
<p>Hum!</p>
<p>Another sword hum sounded. This time, Zhou Wen could clearly hear a sword hum coming from a huge grave.</p>
<p>Up to now, all the swords had basically flown out. However, he never expected that there would still be a sword embedded in a grave.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a careful look and immediately recognized that the sword in the grave was clearly the one that had nearly killed him in the past.</p>
<p>Later on, when the vine sword emitted a sword intent, that sword returned to the grave and didn’t fly out again.</p>
<p>At that moment, the sword was resonating incessantly as though it was about to rush out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could sense that the vine sword’s sword intent was surging towards the sword on the grave. Clearly, it thought highly of the sword.</p>
<p>As for the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords, it was even more direct. It had already flown to the back of the huge grave and floated beside the ancient sword. The sword hum from its body didn’t stop.</p>
<p>However, the sword intent emitted by the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords wasn’t as domineering as the vine sword. It didn’t seem to be controlling the sword, but more like using persuasion.</p>
<p>The sword in the grave didn’t break out of the grave. It looked like it was hesitating.</p>
<p>The Son of Heaven’s Three Swords is only at the Terror grade after all. I’m afraid it’ll be at a disadvantage. Zhou Wen felt that things were going south. In a fight for the sword, the higher-level vine sword was naturally at an advantage.</p>
<p>If I had known that the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords was so powerful, I would have thought of a way to get it to the Calamity grade earlier. Perhaps I would still have a chance of fighting that vine sword. As Zhou Wen sized up the sword in the grave, he secretly felt regret.</p>
<p>The sword in the grave looked like an ordinary ancient sword. The three-foot-long sword didn’t look gorgeous. The patterns on the sword were very ordinary. It didn’t look like a famous sword at all. Instead, it looked like a standard issue for ancient soldiers.</p>
<p>However, after seeing it pierce through the Chaos Egg, he knew how terrifying its offensive strength was. It was probably not inferior to the Golden Wyrm Scissors.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, he heard a sword hum. The sword rushed out of the grave and floated in the air.</p>
<p>At the instant the sword appeared, all the swords seemed to subconsciously retreat a little.</p>
<p>Who is it helping? Although Zhou Wen felt that the possibility of the sword helping the vine sword was higher, he couldn’t help but have some fantasies. He hoped that the power of the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords would move it.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen also knew that it was unlikely, but there was no other way. All he could do was pray.</p>
<p>The sword floated in the air for a while before suddenly turning into a stream of light that flew towards the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords.</p>
<p>It’s over! Zhou Wen was alarmed as he knew that the situation was hopeless.</p>
<p>The destructive power of that sword was too terrifying. It had chosen to help the vine sword, so it was likely that the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords would be snapped.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, the sword only circled the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords once before charging at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The sword’s flying speed was unbelievably fast and shockingly ruthless. Zhou Wen didn’t even see how it shot over when the tip of the sword touched his chest.</p>
<p>The vine sword’s reaction wasn’t slow either. It blocked the blade, preventing it from really stabbing down.</p>
<p>A shocking sword clang sounded as Zhou Wen felt his body involuntarily fly backward. The vine sword was actually no match for the sword as it flew back with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Son of Heaven’s Sword, oh Son of Heaven’s Sword. You’re really a f*cking good master killer. Such a powerful sword can actually be used by you… Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised, but he couldn’t describe what he felt.</p>
<p>He was still happy, overall. He saw hope.</p>
<p>Indeed, just as the vine sword flew out, the ancient sword that came out of the grave transformed into a beam of light that penetrated the blood-colored avatar’s chest.</p>
<p>This time, there was no Chaos Egg to help Zhou Wen withstand it. Zhou Wen used his body of flesh and blood to directly experience the ancient sword’s might.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body was already comparable to a Human Realm creature, but at the sword’s blade, he was no different from tofu as he was penetrated.</p>
<p>A huge hole appeared in the blood-colored avatar’s chest as the ancient sword passed through. Furthermore, its sword aura tore through Zhou Wen’s body from the wound.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already had a taste of such a destructive sword aura before. However, most of the sword aura back then had been blocked by the Chaos Egg. This time, when it rushed into Zhou Wen’s body without any reservations, Zhou Wen felt as though all his cells were about to be destroyed. There was no buffer at all.</p>
<p>I’m finally liberated! Zhou Wen secretly heaved a sigh of relief, but he never expected another accident to happen.</p>
<p>The remaining half of the vine sword suddenly disintegrated as terrifying sword intents were released. They drilled into Zhou Wen’s body from all directions.</p>
<p>Half of the vine sword’s sword intent had previously fused into Sword Pill.. After the remaining half entered, Sword Pill immediately lit up as sword intent spewed out, forcefully stopping the terrifying sword aura from spreading through Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1558'>Chapter 1558: Intangibility and Corporeality</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The Son of Heaven’s Three Swords’ hum turned sharper when it realized that Zhou Wen wasn’t completely dead. The swords that filled the sky immediately struck down, hoping to dice Zhou Wen’s body to pieces.</p>
<p>On the other side, the ancient sword also realized that Zhou Wen wasn’t dead. It flew over again. This time, its target wasn’t his chest, but Zhou Wen’s head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t Li Xuan. It was impossible for him to live with his head pierced.</p>
<p>He completely gave up on resistance. He had no intention of controlling the blood-colored avatar, but the blood-colored avatar began moving under the driving force of the sword intent in his body.</p>
<p>Sword Pill appeared and transformed into the vine sword. It was held in the blood-colored avatar’s hand as it fought the swords.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously been the one gaming, but now, he felt like he was having a bot play for him. As he watched the blood-colored avatar automatically fight, the weapons that were killed would occasionally drop dimensional crystals or Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>Seeing a Mythical Companion Egg drop, Zhou Wen wanted to pick it up, but he couldn’t. All he could do was watch.</p>
<p>The vine sword’s body had already turned to dust, but now, it was using Sword Pill as its new vessel. Sword Pill’s strength became stronger and stronger, as did its domain.</p>
<p>Many of the swords that approached Sword Pill fell to the ground uncontrollably. Only the especially powerful swords could reach the blood-colored avatar, but the power of the swords became limp as though they lacked strength.</p>
<p>The vine sword’s strength wasn’t weaker than the ancient sword. It only had half its strength left previously to fight the ancient sword. Now, its strength was all inside Sword Pill, so it didn’t appear as weak in battle as before.</p>
<p>However, as Sword Pill’s domain hadn’t completely taken form, it was still difficult for it to fight the ancient sword head-on. Therefore, Sword Pill kept dodging and stalling for time while pulling Zhou Wen’s body along.</p>
<p>Once its strength perfectly fused with Sword Pill, allowing it to advance to the Calamity grade, it would truly have the capital to fight the ancient sword.</p>
<p>Dream on. How can it be as you wish? Zhou Wen sneered inwardly. It was finally time for him to put in the effort.</p>
<p>Previously, the vine sword was independent of his body, but it was different now. The vine sword’s sword intent had completely fused into Sword Pill. It no longer had a body that could be used as a foundation to exert strength, so it relied solely on its will to control Sword Pill.</p>
<p>Sword Pill belonged to Zhou Wen; it was condensed using Zhou Wen’s body as a foundation, making it easier for him to control it.</p>
<p>The vine sword believed that its sword intent was powerful enough that no one could withstand it. It believed that its sword intent could crush Zhou Wen’s will and easily obtain control of Sword Pill.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, it was indeed the case. The vine sword could easily shatter the three thousand sword intents. Such intent was indeed very strong, so strong that Zhou Wen found it unimaginable.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was far from reaching that stage, but this didn’t mean that he didn’t have the ability to resist. Zhou Wen’s realm might be lacking, but in terms of willpower, he was invincible. Perhaps defeating the vine sword’s intent was difficult, but it was still possible to hold it back.</p>
<p>The vine sword intent controlled Sword Pill for the battle when it suddenly stopped. Sword Pill, which was supposed to slash right, paused for a moment, failing to block the ancient sword.</p>
<p>The ancient sword stabbed into the blood-colored avatar’s abdomen as a terrifying sword aura immediately surged in, wreaking havoc in Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>The sword intent and sword aura in Sword Pill immediately surged over, hoping to withstand the sword aura that invaded his body. However, only the sword intent rushed over without the sword aura.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was temporarily unable to control the sword intent brought about by the vine sword, but it wasn’t that simple for the vine sword to borrow the sword aura in Sword Pill. It had to first suppress Zhou Wen’s willpower.</p>
<p>The ancient sword’s aura rapidly spread through Zhou Wen’s body as the sword intent retreated in defeat. Sword intent was only sword intent after all. Without the fusion with corporeal powers like sword aura, sword intent was far inferior to sword aura in terms of destructive power.</p>
<p>The Calamity Zone that it had painstakingly condensed quickly collapsed.</p>
<p>It should be ending soon, right? Zhou Wen felt that he was doomed this time. It was unlikely there would be a turnaround.</p>
<p>It was indeed as Zhou Wen had imagined. The sword aura constantly tore through the blood-colored avatar’s body, putting it on the brink of collapse. In at most twenty to thirty seconds, the body under the corrosion of the sword aura would completely lose its vitality.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen waited for death to arrive while admiring the hopelessness of the vine sword intent.</p>
<p>Why aren’t you showing your arrogance anymore? Where did the arrogance from before go? Zhou Wen was somewhat smug, but on second thought, he was the one who wanted to use the power of the vine sword to advance to the Calamity grade. It didn’t seem wrong for it to give him strength. It was just a little too assertive.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen immediately felt disinterested. This clearly couldn’t be considered a victory. He just didn’t like it and wanted to change the Calamity Zone.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I can’t do anything about it. Your strength is different from the power I want. I have no choice.” Zhou Wen watched as the sword intent was constantly eliminated. As he watched, an idea suddenly flashed in his mind.</p>
<p>While the ancient sword’s sword aura destroyed Zhou Wen’s body, it also destroyed the resisting sword intent. During this process, Zhou Wen discovered an interesting phenomenon.</p>
<p>Sword auras and sword intents were actually two completely different things. Sword auras were corporeal, while sword intents were intangible.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, sword intent couldn’t directly affect matter itself. It could only affect one’s psyche. However, because of the potency of the vine sword’s sword intent, it affected tangible objects. Therefore, it could resist the sword aura.</p>
<p>The clash between tangible and intangible objects made Zhou Wen discover something very interesting.</p>
<p>Is an intangible object really formless and intangible? Zhou Wen had thought so in the past, but after seeing the clash between the sword auras and sword intents, he realized that it wasn’t that simple.</p>
<p>The sword intent affected his body. It was originally impossible for his body to resist such a terrifying sword aura, but under the effects of the intangible sword intent, his body’s strength was strengthened to the point of being able to withstand the sword aura slightly.</p>
<p>This enhancement was extremely shocking. It was clearly an illusion that was similar to a dream, but it could be used in reality.</p>
<p>Could it be that intangible objects can really be transformed into something corporeal? Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he released his control over Sword Pill. Then, he used his willpower to influence Sword Pill and stimulate its sword intent.</p>
<p>With the vine sword intent receiving help, it stabilized the crumbling situation, preventing Zhou Wen from immediately dying.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally wasn’t doing this to help the vine sword intent.. He just wanted to observe for a while and see what the secret between intangibility and corporeality was.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1559'>Chapter 1559: In Between Intangibility and Corporeality</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen only tried his best to maintain the situation. He didn’t wish for the vine sword intent to turn the tables. He only wanted to stall for time so that he could see the profundity between intangibility and corporeality.</p>
<p>However, sword intent was something ethereal to begin with. It could only be sensed, not seen or touched.</p>
<p>Even inside Zhou Wen’s body, he could only sense the sword intent changing his body, but he still couldn’t see it.</p>
<p>It has a powerful influence, but I can’t see or touch it. This feeling is somewhat similar to something I’m familiar with. Zhou Wen thought about what it was.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen thought of what the sword intent was similar to.</p>
<p>The thing Zhou Wen thought of was deities that humans worshiped. However, on careful thought, deities and sword intents could be considered one and the same thing. They were fantasies derived from human thoughts.</p>
<p>Sword intent was actually a form of thought, and deities were also products of human thought. The difference was that sword intent was one’s understanding of the world, while deities were the entrustment of the unknown and fears.</p>
<p>Humans are sentimental creatures. The existence of an intangible object like a deity does sometimes affect the actions and abilities of humans, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>He had heard a story in the past that mentioned a student. Although he studied hard, his results weren’t that good, especially during exams. He failed to be on form every time.</p>
<p>There was once when he went to a nearby temple with his classmates to pray. He didn’t have any plans and thought that he could pray to the deity in passing. In the end, not only did he get an auspicious divination lot, but he also heard a divine voice that the other students didn’t hear. It said that he would definitely be able to learn well and even be admitted into a good university.</p>
<p>However, when he asked the other students, they claimed to not have heard anything.</p>
<p>After returning, not only did the student work harder, but his results also improved significantly. His test results also increased drastically, and he even got into a famous university.</p>
<p>Later on, when they were having a class reunion, they chatted about this matter. Only then did he realize that it was a setup by his few classmates. The drawing of divination lots was rigged in advance, and the divine voice was a played recording. The other students had all heard it.</p>
<p>The reason they did this was that they found this student very hardworking. He just lacked confidence; therefore, they thought of using this method to boost his confidence and dig into his potential. The outcome was indeed very good.</p>
<p>However, what the sword intent had done so far exceeded the influence of pure thought.</p>
<p>If it’s not just an emotional influence, what’s the principle behind it? Zhou Wen constantly observed and pondered, but no matter how he looked at it, it was difficult to observe the true core.</p>
<p>The corporeal sword aura constantly clashed with the sword intent that imperceptibly affected Zhou Wen’s body. All Zhou Wen could see was his body being destroyed by the sword aura, preventing him from truly capturing the existence of the sword intent.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen discovered a problem.</p>
<p>Previously, he had only observed the clash between the two and couldn’t find the true crux of the matter. However, when Zhou Wen focused his gaze on the changes after his body was wrecked, he immediately discovered something different.</p>
<p>The sword aura’s destructive power was extremely potent. It wrecked the body of flesh and blood, disintegrating it into its individual, extremely tiny elements. They were split and split until they were completely invisible as though they had vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that they hadn’t vanished. It was only because they were too tiny that he couldn’t see or sense them.</p>
<p>However, during this process, a very small portion of the matter wasn’t diced to the point of invisibility.</p>
<p>The other flesh and blood were split apart again and again. Finally, nothing could be seen. However, there were wisps of something that resembled smoke or fog that scattered out and vanished at an extremely fast speed.</p>
<p>Although it only existed for a brief period, Zhou Wen was certain that the wisp of smoke wasn’t split by the sword aura. It had vanished by itself.</p>
<p>He carefully observed and realized that after every cell was destroyed, there would be wisps of smoke dissipating, instead of being reduced to smaller parts.</p>
<p>What is that inside the body? It wasn’t split by such a powerful sword aura. The more Zhou Wen sensed it, the more he found the smoke magical.</p>
<p>In the smoke, Zhou Wen felt the existence of the sword intent and the sword aura. However, it only existed for an extremely short period of time like a fleeting meteor.</p>
<p>That wisp of smoke has the specialness of a sword intent and the characteristics of a sword aura, but it’s clearly different from the two. It has a corporeal body that sword intent doesn’t have, and it also has the thought processes that sword aura doesn’t possess… The more Zhou Wen observed the more he found the smoke magical.</p>
<p>However, the smoke only appeared when it was destroyed by the sword aura. It didn’t always exist. Zhou Wen didn’t discover the smoke when he destroyed some of his flesh by himself.</p>
<p>This is interesting. Zhou Wen wanted to see if he could capture the smoke.</p>
<p>The smoke could be touched when it appeared, but even if one enveloped it with sword aura, the smoke would still vanish into thin air. It made capturing it difficult.</p>
<p>He met with failure despite many attempts.</p>
<p>It’s clearly a corporeal object, but it can turn intangible. This is a very bizarre characteristic. Zhou Wen made repeated attempts and failed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gradually realized that it wasn’t that he couldn’t capture it, but the smoke didn’t exist at all.</p>
<p>Since it can go from corporeal to intangible, can it do the reverse? Zhou Wen felt that he could give it a try. The crux seemed to be the clash between sword aura and sword intent.</p>
<p>As sword intent didn’t have a corporeal body, it couldn’t engage in a direct collision—his body was the medium.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen switched methods and kept trying after repeated attempts, hoping to truly figure out what the smoke that was a superposition of corporeality and intangibility was.</p>
<p>This clearly wasn’t an easy task. Zhou Wen had yet to figure out how the smoke was formed, and his body was about to collapse.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had been helping the vine sword maintain its sword intent, he ultimately couldn’t withstand the invasiveness of the sword aura. His body was already on the brink of death.</p>
<p>Sword Pill was covered in cracks and could shatter at any moment.</p>
<p>Can I try it again later? Zhou Wen thought to himself. He would pull out the vine sword again later and experience it again.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Sword Pill finally couldn’t withstand the pressure and exploded.</p>
<p>As Sword Pill was about to completely transform into sword intent, Zhou Wen immediately saw a large amount of smoke spread out from his body like fireworks.</p>
<p>At the instant he died, Zhou Wen suddenly had an inexplicable realization.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1560'>Chapter 1560: Beginningless Sword Domain</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Due to Sword Pill’s explosion, there was too much matter that was in a state of superposition of intangibility and corporeality. It magnified the sensations Zhou Wen experienced by a thousand times, causing his body and mind to be affected.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen clearly sensed the existence of the smoke. No, it shouldn’t be said that it was smoke, but a type of particle. A particle that Zhou Wen had never seen before. The characteristics of this particle were very strange. It had two sides like Yin and Yang. When it switched to Yang, it would exhibit the characteristics of a corporeal object. And when it switched to Yin, it would exhibit the characteristics of an intangible object.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only previously sense its Yang aspects, but not the Yin aspect. He finally sensed the Yin aspect due to the intense effects of Sword Pill’s explosion.</p>
<p>Instantly, every sensation Zhou Wen experienced seemed somewhat different. The smoke that he believed had vanished hadn’t really vanished. It had only switched to Yin. The particles still existed; Zhou Wen just couldn’t see them.</p>
<p>If I treat these particles as sword pills, then… With a thought, all the particles that separated from Zhou Wen’s body instantly switched from Yin to Yang and appeared again, filling the holes in Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised. The particles were like countless Sword Pills that welcomed the invading sword aura as he wished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if this was considered finding success through failure. In fact, it wasn’t just Sword Pill. Even his body had undergone changes.</p>
<p>Under the effects of the countless Sword Pill particles that were in a superposition of corporeality and intangibility, Zhou Wen’s body seemed to change, heading in this direction. The particles that formed his body seemed to be transforming into a superposition of particles.</p>
<p>The infinite Sword Pill particles constantly resisted the sword aura, but the sword aura was just too powerful. The Sword Pill particles were constantly destroyed.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen realized that the Sword Pill particles hadn’t really been destroyed. They only appeared to be destroyed. In fact, they had only switched to Yin. With a thought from Zhou Wen, the Sword Pill particles would switch again, turning into a corporeal sword aura.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if the Sword Pill particles weren’t the sword aura’s match, they still managed to stall for time. It gave Zhou Wen a chance at survival.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen’s body completely transformed into the Sword Pill particles that were in a superposition, a strange sword intent rose from his body. Zhou Wen’s body vanished instantly.</p>
<p>Only the ancient sword that had penetrated his body as well as the sword aura remained in place. Zhou Wen’s body appeared elsewhere as sword intent surged from his body.</p>
<p>Buzz!</p>
<p>The swords that had been affected by the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords fell to the ground one by one, producing a humming sound as though they were worshiping Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Only a few Calamity-grade ancient swords remained flying.</p>
<p>As for the other swords, the influence of the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords prevented them from getting up again.</p>
<p>Only the ancient sword that fought Zhou Wen remained levitated, but it didn’t attack again. It only faced Zhou Wen as though it was hesitating.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen waved his hand at the distant Son of Heaven’s Three Swords. It seemed extremely unwilling, but under the pressure of the sword intent, it had no choice but to return to Zhou Wen’s hand.</p>
<p>This was the first time Zhou Wen had held the unsheathed Son of Heaven’s Three Swords. He already understood why he couldn’t unsheathe it.</p>
<p>If the Son of Heaven fought, corpses would be strewn for miles. There was no need for him to draw his sword. If there came a day when the Son of Heaven drew his sword, the only use was probably for him to commit suicide.</p>
<p>This didn’t mean that the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords could only be used for suicide. Its effects weren’t in combat but on the psyche.</p>
<p>Therefore, despite the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords being only at the Terror grade, it could affect the powerful ancient sword. This didn’t mean that it was stronger than the ancient sword, but because it was the sword of the Son of Heaven.</p>
<p>The Son of Heaven didn’t necessarily have very powerful martial strength, but he could commandeer generals with invincible combat strength.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen held the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords, sword intent emitted from it. The extremely terrifying sword intent on his body instantly elevated.</p>
<p>The Calamity-grade ancient swords that could still fly also landed on the ground one by one. Although they weren’t trembling, they no longer showed their original arrogance.</p>
<p>Only the ancient sword that fought Zhou Wen remained floating.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen faced it with his sword as he walked towards it step by step. The ancient sword suddenly emitted a sword hum as it transformed into a sword beam that flew away and returned to the grave.</p>
<p>With the sword hum emitted by the ancient sword, the other ancient swords flew away and returned to their respective graves.</p>
<p>Even the Son of Heaven has things he can’t obtain. Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed as he looked at the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords in his hand and sheathed it.</p>
<p>He tried pulling it out again. This time, it was very easy to pull it out. It wasn’t like before.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you disallow me to unsheathe you? Ain’t I unsheathing you now? Ha!” Zhou Wen sheathed and unsheathed it repeatedly to vent his former frustrations of not being able to unsheathe the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords.</p>
<p>Every time Zhou Wen unsheathed the Son of Heaven’s Sword, the swords in the Ancient Sword Tomb would hum. After sheathing it, the sword hum would stop as though they were remote-controlled.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to kill the swords. He looked at the blood-colored avatar’s information, and indeed, the Qi Refinement Art had a Calamity Zone.</p>
<p>Calamity Zone: Beginningless Sword Domain (Human Realm)</p>
<p>This works. Although this was somewhat different from what Zhou Wen had imagined, it wasn’t a bad choice.</p>
<p>As the saying went, man proposes, God disposes. There weren’t many things in life that completely followed a predetermined trajectory. Perhaps the Beginningless Sword Domain wasn’t what Zhou Wen wanted, but it wasn’t something he didn’t want. This was already a very good outcome.</p>
<p>Show me how strong this Beginningless Sword Domain is. Zhou Wen activated the Sword Domain as the ancient swords within the Sword Domain flew out of their graves.</p>
<p>Countless threads of sword aura appeared out of thin air, destroying the swords in the vicinity. One of the Calamity-grade ancient swords emitted a terrifying sword beam, hoping to fight the sword aura.</p>
<p>Under the impact of the infinite sword aura that resembled a galaxy, the sword shattered and a Companion Egg dropped.</p>
<p>For a moment, there was no complete sword in the Sword Domain. There were only dimensional crystals shimmering on the ground.</p>
<p>Even the Calamity-grade ancient sword seemed to lose the courage to resist when Zhou Wen unsheathed the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords. It could only allow Zhou Wen to attack without daring to retaliate.</p>
<p>Only the ancient sword that had fought Zhou Wen remained unmoved.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1561'>Chapter 1561: Heaven Defying Slaying</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to provoke it either. Although the Qi Refinement Art had advanced to the Calamity grade, it was still no match for the ancient sword in terms of combat strength.</p>
<p>He picked up the Companion Eggs that had dropped from the Calamity-grade ancient swords and absorbed the other useful Companion Eggs and dimensional crystals.</p>
<p>Now that he had the Beginningless Sword Domain, other than the ancient sword, the other ancient swords were free for slaughter. It felt great farming them.</p>
<p>After farming the entire Ancient Sword Tomb once, four Mythical and one Terror-grade Companion Eggs dropped. Together with the Calamity-grade Companion Egg, Zhou Wen was very satisfied with his harvest.</p>
<p>Red Night: Calamity-grade.</p>
<p>Life Providence: Sword of the Emperor</p>
<p>Life Soul: Red Dragon</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Meridian Slaying</p>
<p>Terror Form: Red Night</p>
<p>Calamity Zone: Heaven-defying Slaying (Human Realm)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The stats of Red Night weren’t very high. Among Zhou Wen’s few Calamity-grade Companion Beasts, it was considered the weakest. It couldn’t evolve, nor did it have an S-grade Terror transformation. Its skills were very ordinary, and its combat strength wasn’t very good.</p>
<p>However, its Calamity Zone was rather interesting when Zhou Wen gave it a try. This Heaven-defying Slaying Zone sounded like an offensive domain, but it wasn’t.</p>
<p>It was a very strange domain. If Zhou Wen couldn’t see the data of characters, it would have been difficult for him to sense the effects of this domain.</p>
<p>The Heaven-defying Slaying Zone was actually a domain that controlled the light shone from providence. It could eliminate the negative and boost the positive.</p>
<p>Usually, the effect of this domain was to increase the light one received from providence depending on the situation. For example, the drop rate would be higher. It wasn’t of much use.</p>
<p>If someone used powers related to providence to secretly deal with Zhou Wen, the sword would show its usefulness.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had Dao Sutra and Truth Listener. Even without this sword, the techniques involving the light from providence weren’t of much use to him. However, with this sword, Zhou Wen could not only defend against it, but he could also counterattack.</p>
<p>The sword’s good, but unfortunately, its combat strength is a little weak. Its various attributes are slightly higher than the Calamity grade standard. It’s considered the weakest Calamity-grade creature. Zhou Wen looked at the Red Night and had some other thoughts.</p>
<p>The most useful thing about this sword is its Calamity Zone. The other abilities are very ordinary. If I fuse it with the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, wouldn’t I be able to push the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to the Calamity grade? It’s best if it can inherit the Heaven-defying Slaying Calamity Zone. If it can’t, having a new Calamity Zone can’t be a loss, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>However, when he thought of the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s Jinxes Master skill, Zhou Wen was somewhat hesitant.</p>
<p>A Calamity-grade Jinxes Master was no joking matter.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, the temptation of the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General advancing to the Calamity grade was too great for Zhou Wen. It was practically born for the Big Dipper dungeon. In a high-temperature area like a star, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was an invincible existence.</p>
<p>It could already withstand Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s blast of light at the Terror grade. If it advanced to the Calamity grade, Zhou Wen might be able to clear the Big Dipper instance dungeon with just this Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Of course, the green-armored Starlord on Phecda was an exception. He had a very strange ability, and a special ability was probably needed to deal with him. He wasn’t likely to be killed simply with powerful offensive strength.</p>
<p>Gritting his teeth, Zhou Wen placed Red Night and the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General in the fusion column. Seeing that the compatibility was only 2%, he steeled his heart and clicked on ‘Fusion.’</p>
<p>With a flash of light, Red Night which was in the supplementary material column vanished. The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General underwent a new change.</p>
<p>The change this time wasn’t significant. His appearance didn’t seem to have changed much, but the purple flames inside his armor flickered erratically. It seemed to have changed, but it wasn’t too obvious.</p>
<p>Could it be that he hasn’t advanced to the Calamity grade? Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at the information on the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General: Calamity (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Malicious Evil</p>
<p>Life Soul: Tiger Soul Runes</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Ferocious and Evil</p>
<p>Terror Form: Devil Knight (S-grade)</p>
<p>Calamity Zone: Heaven-defying Slaying (Human Realm)</p>
<p>Strength: 100</p>
<p>Speed: 100</p>
<p>Constitution: 100</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 100</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Tempered Steel Cauldron, Rampage, Magic Stone Curse, One with Horse, Penetrating Pierce, Evil Penetration, Badlands, Jinxes Master, Crazy Sweep, Life Slaying.</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>Seeing that the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General had really advanced to the Calamity grade, Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief. This was a fusion at the cost of a Calamity-grade Companion Egg. If he hadn’t advanced, it would have been a huge loss.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the outcome wasn’t too bad. The Calamity Zone was inherited, and there was an additional Life Slaying skill. This skill seemed to be a skill that was compatible with the domain. It could only be used when the Heaven-defying Slaying Zone was activated.</p>
<p>“Tiger Soul General, o’ Tiger Soul General. It wasn’t easy for me to raise you up. You should give me something in return, right?” Zhou Wen left the Ancient Sword Tomb and dripped his blood to refresh the dungeon. He planned on grinding the Ancient Sword Tomb dungeon a few more times. Perhaps he could farm another Calamity-grade Companion Beast.</p>
<p>However, after Zhou Wen entered the dungeon, he realized that the vine sword was gone. The swords above the Mythical stage were also gone. Only the powerful ancient sword remained.</p>
<p>I reckon it will take 24 hours to respawn like other Mythical creatures. Zhou Wen had no choice but to leave the Ancient Sword Tomb dungeon.</p>
<p>I wonder how Guide City is doing. With Li Xuan and company around, there shouldn’t be any major problems, right? Zhou Wen was somewhat vexed. Demonic Neonate hadn’t woken up, and he didn’t know how long she would be sleeping.</p>
<p>It was impossible for Zhou Wen to keep waiting. He was now prepared to think of a way to return through the Cube.</p>
<p>Now, there was another problem that Zhou Wen found troublesome. Demonic Neonate was Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast and was one with him, but she couldn’t return to Zhou Wen. If he took her into the Cube, he didn’t know if she would be considered a person.</p>
<p>If she counted as one, he only needed to bring Liz and Leem along to enter the Cube. If she didn’t count, he would have to find another person.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether he wanted to find someone else, Zhou Wen had to ensure their safety.</p>
<p>Previously, when Jiuyang and company entered the Cube, there were definitely four people in the beginning. However, the other three were probably just tools.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen guessed that the three of them definitely weren’t of a high level and were there just to make up the numbers. After entering, they couldn’t withstand the high temperature and had no chance of appearing on the Cube’s screen before turning to ashes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t that ruthless, so he definitely couldn’t do such a thing.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate’s safety wasn’t difficult to resolve. He could protect her within the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>The main problem was Liz, Leem, and company. The Chaos Egg couldn’t accommodate them.</p>
<p>I guess this is the only way. Zhou Wen thought for a moment before calling Liz and Leem over.</p>
<p>“Do you know how to use Companion Beasts?” Zhou Wen asked Liz and Leem.</p>
<p>“Master, what’s a Companion Beast?” The two sisters were taken aback as they asked in puzzlement.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1562'>Chapter 1562: Fire-Runic Divine Armor Queen</h3>
<p>That’s right. In such a place, they don’t have the ability to hunt dimensional creatures. How can they have Companion Beasts? It’s only normal to be unaware of them, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>“Companion Beasts are pets that help you in combat. Furthermore, these pets are loyal. Even if you get them to carry out a mission that they know they will die, they won’t hesitate to carry it out,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Master, we are willing to sacrifice everything for you. If you want us to die, we will not hesitate… If we do anything wrong, please punish us.” The two girls clearly misunderstood Zhou Wen’s intentions and immediately knelt down.</p>
<p>“Get up.” Zhou Wen knew that there was no way to explain it to them as he gave the order.</p>
<p>The two girls’ eyes were still brimming with tears as though the tears would fall at any moment. However, they still obeyed Zhou Wen’s orders and stood up.</p>
<p>“I want to bestow each of you a Companion Beast. Take in the feelings of having a Companion Beast.” Zhou Wen’s Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art could transfer Companion Beasts to other humans.</p>
<p>However, Liz and Leem weren’t humans from Earth. He didn’t know if they could use Companion Beasts, so an experiment was needed.</p>
<p>He transferred two Heavy-Armored Warriors to Liz and Leem, making them feel a little nervous and amazed. They were even somewhat alarmed. From their expressions, Zhou Wen knew that he had succeeded. Like ordinary humans, they had the ability to use Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>“Master, is this a Companion Beast? It’s really magical. Thank you for the reward. I will definitely be like a Companion Beast, working hard for you until my death.” Liz took in the sensations awarded by the Companion Beast and looked at Zhou Wen with admiration.</p>
<p>“Master, me too.” Leem was very excited. She had already summoned the Heavy-Armored Warrior and was curiously sizing him up.</p>
<p>Things will be simple since they can use Companion Beasts. Zhou Wen only needed to give them Companion Beasts that could withstand high temperatures and make them persist until they entered the dungeon. Then, as long as they didn’t die, Zhou Wen could send them into the chaos space and clear the dungeon alone.</p>
<p>The main problem was that there was no way to store them in the chaos space before he entered the Cube’s dungeon. They had to withstand the high temperature for a brief period after being teleported in.</p>
<p>Of course, ordinary armor couldn’t withstand such high temperatures, but this wasn’t too much of a problem for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Let me see. What should I fuse to form highly fire-resistant armor? Zhou Wen began studying the Companion Beasts he had, especially the ones in the fire-elemental instance dungeons.</p>
<p>There were many fire-elemental Companion Beasts in the Metalwork Temple. A single fire-elemental Companion Beast definitely couldn’t withstand such high temperatures, but Zhou Wen had Fusion.</p>
<p>As long as he turned a Companion Beast’s Life Providence, Life Soul, and Wheel of Destiny into some form of fire-elemental resistance, they would be able to use some fire-elemental resistance skills to withstand the high temperature.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen still needed to experiment after completion. If it didn’t work, he could think of a way to fuse the armor until they reached the Terror grade. That would solve all problems.</p>
<p>Firstly, Zhou Wen planned on using the Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior as a foundation. The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General had fused with it, making it an important part of him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t expect the newly fused Companion Beasts to be as strong as the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. All he needed was enough fire-elemental resistance.</p>
<p>He chose some fire-elemental Companion Beasts that had higher compatibility with Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior before attempting to fuse them.</p>
<p>There were many Companion Beasts with fire-elemental abilities. Furthermore, they could replicate the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s pathway and obtain some useful skills.</p>
<p>After a few attempts, Zhou Wen realized that it was impossible to replicate the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s pathway. As the compatibility was too low, it was impossible to succeed without Jinxes Master.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to choose a new fusion pathway again. He fused the Steel Cauldron Sprite, Fire Furnace Queen, Fire Giant, and other Companion Beasts with the Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior.</p>
<p>The outcome wasn’t optimal. The initial compatibility wasn’t bad and the success rate was rather high. Even if there were occasional failures, he could start all over again. After all, Zhou Wen had quite a number of such Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>However, the most critical step was the fusion with Fire Furnace Queen.</p>
<p>Fire Furnace Queen had a Fire Elemental Body Life Providence, Fire Crown Life Soul, and Fire Elemental Affinity skills. These skills were very suitable for Fire Resistance armor.</p>
<p>However, Fire Furnace Queen’s compatibility with the Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior was only a pitiful 12%. The fusions met with repeated failures.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen had farmed plenty of Companion Beasts. He would keep trying after each failure. There was bound to be an instance when he would succeed.</p>
<p>It was great to be rich. After dozens of fusions, he managed to obtain four. However, among the four, only two had their Life Providences and Life Souls inherited from Fire Furnace Queen. Furthermore, only one of the two had an armor companion form.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only continue fusing. It was only because Zhou Wen had many Companion Beasts that he had kept over the years. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to withstand such losses.</p>
<p>After almost 80 fusions, a total of three met Zhou Wen’s minimum requirements—armor form, a Fire Elemental Body Life Providence, and a Fire Crown Life Soul. Two of them had Fire Elemental Affinity.</p>
<p>With these three foundations, Zhou Wen began choosing highly compatible fire-elemental Companion Beasts to continue the fusion. For the advancement to the Mythical stage, Zhou Wen chose Fire Giant.</p>
<p>This Mythical fire-elemental Companion Beast had Flaming Rebirth as its Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>However, Fire Giant’s Flaming Rebirth was different from a phoenix’s Nirvana. A phoenix’s Nirvana was a form of true rebirth, but Flaming Rebirth was having its thick skin reborn amidst the flames. It had a powerful fire affinity. Although it wasn’t a true rebirth, it was very useful for flaming armor.</p>
<p>With a compatibility score of 74, he failed once when he fused the three with the Fire Giant. The one that failed was the one with Fire Elemental Affinity. It made Zhou Wen’s heart ache.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there were two more. It was still acceptable if one failed.</p>
<p>Following that, Zhou Wen became even more cautious. When he chose skills to fuse, he didn’t dare fuse those below 90% compatibility. He even chose those above 95%.</p>
<p>After more than a day, Zhou Wen finally succeeded in fusing two armor Companion Beasts with extremely high fire-elemental resistance.</p>
<p>Fire-Runic Divine Armor Queen: Mythical</p>
<p>Life Providence: Fire Elemental Body</p>
<p>Life Soul: Flaming Crown</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Flaming Rebirth</p>
<p>Strength: 67</p>
<p>Speed: 72</p>
<p>Constitution: 61</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 80</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Fire Elemental Affinity, Divine Runes, Flaming Armor, Fire Shield, Fire Furnace.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Armor</p>
<p>The other’s attributes and skills were similar, but it lacked Fire Elemental Affinity.</p>
<p>Let’s see if this armor can withstand Dubhe’s high temperature. If it can’t, I’ll have to think of a way to fuse it with Terror-grade creatures, Zhou Wen thought to himself as he summoned the Fire-Runic Queen in her armor form..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1563'>Chapter 1563: Fire-Elemental Defense Armor</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Red flames immediately enveloped Zhou Wen’s body as the black armor clung tightly to his skin, perfectly outlining his muscular body.</p>
<p>On the black armor, there were some red crystal-like lines embedded, forming a crystalline pattern. The flames enveloped the armor, making Zhou Wen look like a flaming dark rider from the abyss.</p>
<p>It looks pretty good, but I wonder how useful it is. I hope that this one without Fire Elemental Affinity can withstand it. Zhou Wen launched the dungeon and entered Dubhe with the Fire-Runic Divine Armor Queen.</p>
<p>The high temperature of Dubhe was enough to burn ordinary Mythical creatures to ashes. It was indeed difficult for Mythical armor to protect two Epic humans.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen didn’t have high requirements. As long as the Fire-Runic Divine Armor Queen could last for two to three seconds, it would be enough to prevent Liz and Leem from being killed by the high temperature.</p>
<p>At the instant he entered Dubhe, Zhou Wen, who was wearing the Fire-Runic Queen armor, felt the temperature instantly rise. However, the Fire-Runic Queen armor didn’t immediately melt. Instead, the flaming patterns on his body lit up as the flames on the armor’s exterior burned crazily.</p>
<p>The black parts of the armor were like red-hot metal pieces that suffused a slight red glow. However, not only did the temperature inside the armor not continue to rise, but it also slowly decreased.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised. The effects of the Fire-Ruinc Divine Armor Queen were much better than expected. It lived up as a fire-elemental resistant armor. Such an effect was probably comparable to a fire-elemental Terror-grade armor.</p>
<p>This wasn’t exactly surprising. Typical fire-elemental armor only had one or two fire-elemental defensive skills. It was almost impossible to find one which had every attribute being fire-elemental.</p>
<p>Although the temperature inside is still a little high, it should still be within the limits of an Epic stage human, right? Zhou Wen felt that he could return to Earth this time.</p>
<p>However, before that, Zhou Wen had to confirm if Demonic Neonate was considered a human. If she wasn’t, Zhou Wen needed to find another human and fuse another Fire-Runic Divine Armor Queen.</p>
<p>He took Demonic Neonate to the Cube and stabbed Demonic Neonate’s finger with a needle, dripping a drop of blood. The blood dripped onto the Cube and was immediately absorbed by it. The Cube lit up as the number ‘3’ appeared. Clearly, it required the blood of three creatures to truly activate it.</p>
<p>Since Demonic Neonate is considered a person, that’s simple. I can return to Earth now. After Zhou Wen returned to the cemetery, he summoned Liz and Leem over.</p>
<p>“If I were to go somewhere very, very far away, perhaps never to return, are you willing to follow me?” Zhou Wen asked the two girls.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen could have taken them away without saying a word, he didn’t wish to do so.</p>
<p>After all, this was their home. The chances of them returning in the future were slim. Zhou Wen didn’t wish to force them if they were unwilling to leave. In fact, there was no need to force them. With Regretless City’s present situation, as long as Zhou Wen threw out some bait, many people would definitely be willing to return to Earth with him.</p>
<p>Leaving this place could even be considered an opportunity for Liz and Leem.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen still hoped that Liz and Leem would return with him. This was because their Life Providences and Life Souls were somewhat special. They would be of help to Zhou Wen when he built the city in the future.</p>
<p>Liz’s Life Providence was Goddess of Blessing, while her Life Soul was Blessing Halo. As for Leem’s Life Providence, it was Goddess of Curses, and her Life Soul was Curse Halo. One would receive a huge boost when the former used a blessing-type skill, while the other’s curse would attain terrifying levels.</p>
<p>The two of them were practically born for large-scale battles. One could bless their allies while the other could curse their enemies. They were a perfect match.</p>
<p>The premise was that they were willing to follow Zhou Wen. If they were tricked to join him, they might fall out with Zhou Wen after seeing what kind of world was out there on Earth. It wouldn’t be worth it.</p>
<p>“Master, our lives are yours. You can take us anywhere.” To Zhou Wen’s surprise, Liz and Leem answered firmly without any hesitation.</p>
<p>“Go back and prepare. Say farewell to your family and friends before leaving with me. If you haven’t thought it through, you don’t have to return. I won’t blame you,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Liz and Leem exchanged looks as Leem said, “Master, please wait. We’ll be right back.”</p>
<p>“Regardless of whether you return or not, tell your City Lord to come over,” Zhou Wen added.</p>
<p>After the two girls agreed, they left the cemetery. Zhou Wen turned to look at the two graves. After some hesitation, he decided not to touch the puppets below.</p>
<p>“Have you really decided to return using the Cube?” Grim Demon still hoped to wait for Demonic Neonate to wake up.</p>
<p>“I’ve already decided. Come back,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Grim Demon knew that it was impossible for him to convince Zhou Wen, so he obediently returned to the Demonic Sword.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen placed the sheathed Demonic Sword in Demonic Neonate’s arms and waited for the City Lord to arrive. Furthermore, he also wanted to know if Liz and Leem would return.</p>
<p>Liz and Leem came to the cemetery with the City Lord. The City Lord knelt on the ground and said with tears in his eyes, “Your Devilish Excellency, are you returning to Lost Paradise? Did we do something wrong? If so, please punish me. Don’t abandon us, your citizens!”</p>
<p>“You did nothing wrong. It’s just that it’s time for me to return,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>“I see. Then please take Liz and Leem with you and let them serve you in our stead…” the City Lord immediately said.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll take them along.” Zhou Wen agreed, having never planned on rejecting the offer.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that it wouldn’t be nice if he didn’t leave anything behind after taking away two extremely talented people.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the humans here had a very difficult time surviving. They didn’t even stand a chance.</p>
<p>“You should already know what a Companion Beast is, right?” Zhou Wen asked the City Lord.</p>
<p>“What Companion Beast?” The City Lord was taken aback.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could tell that his expression wasn’t faked as he looked at Liz and Leem in surprise. He was somewhat puzzled as to why they hadn’t told the City Lord about Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>“Without your permission, we won’t leak anything regarding you,” Liz and Leem said seriously.</p>
<p>“Very good.” Zhou Wen was very satisfied with their performance, so he got them to explain what Companion Beasts were.</p>
<p>“I’ll bestow you a Companion Beast, giving you the ability to fight ordinary dimensional creatures,” Zhou Wen said after the City Lord got a better understanding.</p>
<p>“Your Devilish Excellency, can you bestow a Companion Beast to my clansmen?” To Zhou Wen’s surprise, the City Lord said such words.</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen asked the City Lord.</p>
<p>“Because I’m already old and don’t have much time to live. Your Excellency, you are giving us hope. I hope to leave it to the most promising youth in Regretless City. That will be our future,” said the City Lord.</p>
<p>“Alright, summon him over.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly. This City Lord was indeed not bad.. At the very least, he wasn’t a selfish person.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1564'>Chapter 1564: Collision</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“What’s your name?” Zhou Wen asked the kneeling youth.</p>
<p>“Your Devilish Excellency, my name is Cain.” The youth looked at Zhou Wen with anticipation. There was no fear in his eyes, only adoration.</p>
<p>“Cain?” Zhou Wen looked at the youth in front of him in a daze. He had delicate features. Although he was still a youth, he was extremely handsome. His facial features were well-defined, and one could tell that he would grow up to be a very handsome man in the future.</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Devilish Excellency. My name is Cain,” the youth repeated.</p>
<p>It’s probably just a coincidence, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t unfamiliar with the name Cain. In the bible, there were also people who said that he was the ancestor of evil. Others said he was the ancestor of vampires.</p>
<p>However, Cain was unlikely to be the son of Adam and Eve. This youth’s seniority was clearly much lower. It was impossible for him to be the son of Adam and Eve.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if he was really Cain, he was likely an evil person. The City Lord wouldn’t treat him as the hope of Regretless City, much less offer him the Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“Cain, I’ll bestow you a Companion Beast. I hope you can use it to protect your home, family, and friends. Don’t disappoint the City Lord’s expectations of you,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Devilish Excellency. I’ll abide by your teachings.” The youth looked at Zhou Wen with admiration as he listened attentively.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to give the Golden Battle God to the City Lord. The Terror-grade Golden Battle God was also a long-range offensive Companion Beast. In the future, he would have a chance of hunting some Mythical dimensional creatures. Slowly, he might have a chance of improving the lives of the humans in Regretless City.</p>
<p>However, when he saw the youth and heard his name, Zhou Wen suddenly had an idea. He called Grim Demon out again.</p>
<p>“What do you want? Getting me to return one moment and wanting me to be out the next,” Grim Demon shouted unhappily.</p>
<p>“Give me a Terror-grade Ancient Snake Companion Egg.” Zhou Wen extended his hand in front of Grim Demon.</p>
<p>“How could I have that?” Grim Demon shook his head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared at Grim Demon and didn’t say another word. Grim Demon forced a smile and said, “I really don’t! Don’t look at me like that. I really don’t have one. If you don’t believe me, search…”</p>
<p>Finally, Grim Demon took out a Terror-grade Ancient Snake Companion Egg as though it was a magic trick and placed it in Zhou Wen’s hand.</p>
<p>“I’m downright unlucky to have encountered you.” Grim Demon grumbled as he returned to the Demonic Sword, ignoring Zhou Wen’s subsequent calls.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hatched the Ancient Snake Companion Egg and glanced at the kneeling youth before transferring it to him.</p>
<p>With his Epic strength, it was impossible for him to incubate a Terror-grade Companion Beast. This was the only way for him to possess a Terror-grade Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“Your Devilish Excellency!” The youth took in the information transmitted to him by the Ancient Snake Companion Beast. He was immediately pleasantly surprised as he looked at Zhou Wen with even more admiration.</p>
<p>“Good luck.” With that said, Zhou Wen turned to Liz and Leem and transferred the two Fire-Runic Divine Armor Queens to them.</p>
<p>“Master!” Liz and Leem were pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>“Put them on and leave with me. You need their strength,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Liz and Leem summoned their Fire-Runic Divine Armor Queens. Armor burning with flames enveloped their bodies. Amidst the flickering flames, their petite bodies were accentuated by the armor, making them look like succubi from hell.</p>
<p>The City Lord and the youth looked at the two sisters in a daze as though they didn’t know them.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.” Zhou Wen carried Demonic Neonate and led the two sisters to the Cube.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company walked into the Cube. Under Zhou Wen’s orders, they dripped their blood and activated the Cube. They vanished, having instantly been teleported away by the Cube.</p>
<p>The people of Regretless City knelt in front of the Cube and worshiped it. Some even cried as they called out to the Devil King.</p>
<p>When he arrived at Dubhe Palace, Zhou Wen immediately looked at Liz and Leem. Seeing their armor burning with raging flames, he stored them in the chaos space straight away.</p>
<p>Only he stood in front of Dubhe Palace and looked at its door. The Chaos Egg around him had already appeared.</p>
<p>The Cubes all over the world lit up at the same time.</p>
<p>Everyone’s eyes were immediately attracted by this commotion. The various factions had been paying attention to the Cube’s situation. When they saw the Cube light up, people immediately began filming.</p>
<p>However, when they saw the scene on the Cube, they couldn’t help but be stunned.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Xia Liuchuan, who was a guest at the Zhang family residence, said with a strange expression when he saw the projection on the Cube.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu, who was accompanying Xia Liuchuan, had a strange expression.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just them. Everyone in the Federation was surprised and puzzled.</p>
<p>On the Cube’s screen stood a person and an egg the height of a person floating in the air.</p>
<p>Everyone knew that person. He was Saint Jiuyang, who had previously cleared Dubhe Palace and obtained first place.</p>
<p>However, many people didn’t know what the egg was.</p>
<p>Ordinary people might not know, but Zhang Chunqiu, Xia Liuchuan, and others who were more familiar with Zhou Wen recognized that the egg was Zhou Wen’s ability. Zhou Wen was undoubtedly inside.</p>
<p>“When did Zhou Wen mix with the Holy Land?” Xia Liuchuan said in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“He wouldn’t.” Zhang Chunqiu shook his head and said, “I reckon it’s a coincidence. He entered the Cube dungeon at the same time as Jiuyang.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t this too much of a coincidence? Furthermore, will this work?” Xia Liuchuan wasn’t sure either.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Xia Liuchuan who didn’t believe it. Zhou Wen also found it unbelievable. Just as he put the sisters in and summoned the Chaos Egg, he saw a figure appear not far away.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it said that only four people can enter this Cube dimensional zone at a time? Why can others enter?” Zhou Wen looked at Jiuyang in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Jiuyang looked at Zhou Wen in equal puzzlement.</p>
<p>The three people who had entered with him had already turned to dust. It was impossible for anyone to be here. Furthermore, he had never seen the egg in front of him.</p>
<p>“Strange, why are there other creatures here?” Jiuyang frowned as he stared at the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Just as everyone was feeling puzzled, the Cube suddenly flashed. A line of words appeared: “Two groups of creatures activated the Cube at the same time. PVP mode activated.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Jiuyang also saw the glowing words floating in the air. Although there was no deeper explanation, they could roughly guess that the two groups could fight in the dimensional zone. They might even have to kill each other.</p>
<p>“Chunqiu, this isn’t good. Zhou Wen was actually so unlucky to encounter Jiuyang. A place like Dubhe Palace is basically Jiuyang’s home ground. He has already cleared it once, and now he’s here again. It’s highly likely that he has the confidence to kill Starlord Ravenous Wolf and snatch first place. Zhou Wen is in trouble. I hope he doesn’t realize that it’s Zhou Wen. The Holy Land doesn’t have a good impression of Zhou Wen.. They will definitely want to kill him…” Xia Liuchuan was secretly worried for Zhou Wen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1565'>Chapter 1565: Unlucky Egg</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen and Jiuyang stared at each other. Although they didn’t know the rules of the PVP match, they could guess that the two of them were definitely opposing competitors. Finishing off the opponent was definitely not wrong.</p>
<p>Jiuyang didn’t know that the Chaos Egg belonged to Zhou Wen, nor did he know what it was. However, he had a natural advantage in a place like Dubhe Palace. With the Sun God Armor, killing Starlord Ravenous Wolf was a possibility, so he naturally wouldn’t retreat.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen actually didn’t know Jiuyang because he hadn’t watched him when he cleared the level. In Regretless City, there wasn’t any Internet to read the news, so he didn’t know Jiuyang. All he knew was that there was such a person on the rankings.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that Jiuyang was a human and didn’t wish to kill him. After all, he had only come this time to return through the teleportation nexus. He had no intention of rushing up the rankings, so he ignored Jiuyang and went straight for Dubhe Palace’s door.</p>
<p>“Wait.” Jiuyang suddenly shouted at him.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen asked Jiuyang.</p>
<p>“Are you human?” Jiuyang was slightly taken aback when he heard Zhou Wen’s voice. He imagined that there would be a high-level dimensional creature inside the Chaos Egg, but his voice sounded human.</p>
<p>“So what if I am?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s answer immediately excited the Federation citizens.</p>
<p>Very few humans could enter Dubhe Palace. Now, many people were guessing who the human in the Chaos Egg was and if he was a human with a Guardian.</p>
<p>Although humans with Guardians were pure humans, they weren’t as welcomed as humans who took Mythical Serums.</p>
<p>Saints like Jiuyang who came from the Holy Land were even more unpopular.</p>
<p>People still had some fantasies before they saw who the person inside the Chaos Egg was. They hoped that it was a human who had relied on his own abilities to rush into Dubhe Palace and not a human who had borrowed the power of a Guardian.</p>
<p>“As a human, I’ll give you a way out. Follow me and don’t do anything,” Jiuyang said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Everyone understood what Jiuyang meant. If Zhou Wen were to vie for the rankings with him, Zhou Wen would die. If he didn’t compete with him and followed his every order, he would still live.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Zhou Wen and waited for his answer.</p>
<p>Although many people felt that fighting Jiuyang in a place like Dubhe Palace was no different from courting death, most people still hoped that they could fight. After all, it was human nature to enjoy spectacles.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen agreed immediately.</p>
<p>He had no intention of competing with Jiuyang for the ranking. It was meaningless because if he didn’t clear the Big Dipper instance dungeon, he wouldn’t be able to obtain the rewards. There was no point in competing.</p>
<p>Now, all Zhou Wen wanted to do was quickly return to Earth. He didn’t want to invite trouble.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s answer left Jiuyang slightly taken aback. He never expected the other party to immediately cower.</p>
<p>However, since he had cowered, Jiuyang didn’t have any intention of killing him. He glanced at Zhou Wen and said, “I hope you know what you should and shouldn’t do. Otherwise, bear the consequences yourself.”</p>
<p>With that said, Jiuyang walked towards Dubhe Palace’s door.</p>
<p>“How boring. He gave up just like that. He’s not a man at all.”</p>
<p>“That’s a wise decision. To fight Jiuyang in a place like Dubhe palace when he has the power of the Sun God is no different from throwing an egg at a rock.”</p>
<p>“It’s no wonder he wears an egg on the outside. He’s just an unlucky egg. It wasn’t easy for him to attempt the Cube’s rankings. I reckon he only wanted to rush to the teleportation nexus, but he ended up so unlucky. He activated the Cube at the same time as Saint Jiuyang and entered some PVP mode. Thankfully Jiuyang is kind. Otherwise, he can only blame it on his bad luck if he is killed.”</p>
<p>“Haha, Unlucky Egg. How apt.”</p>
<p>Soon, the words “Unlucky Egg” spread online. Looking at Zhou Wen, who was floating in the air and entering Dubhe Palace behind Jiuyang, they came to believe that the words “Unlucky Egg” suited him.</p>
<p>“Although it’s a little embarrassing, it’s better than fighting Jiuyang in a place like Dubhe Palace. It won’t be too late to settle scores with Jiuyang after he returns to Earth,” Xia Liuchuan said with a smile as he heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu looked at the Chaos Egg in puzzlement and muttered to himself, “Strange.”</p>
<p>“What’s strange?” Xia Liuchuan looked at Zhang Chunqiu and asked.</p>
<p>“I know Zhou Wen quite well. With his personality, there’s no reason for him not to vie for first place unless he’s not attempting to clear the level. Although Jiuyang is powerful and has a natural advantage in Dubhe Palace, Zhou Wen is probably aiming for first place if he’s there. He has to defeat Jiuyang no matter what. Since he has to defeat Jiuyang, is there a need for him to compromise?” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“That makes sense.” Xia Liuchuan thought for a moment and felt that Zhang Chunqiu was right.</p>
<p>Back when Zhou Wen fought Xia Jiuhuang in that extremely difficult situation, Zhou Wen didn’t show a hint of cowardice.</p>
<p>“According to what you said, if he isn’t trying for the rankings, why did he go to Dubhe Palace?” Xia Liuchuan said after some thought.</p>
<p>“You’d have to ask him in person.” Zhang Chunqiu had no idea either.</p>
<p>They couldn’t guess that Zhou Wen was just using it as a waypoint.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed behind Jiuyang. Just as he entered Dubhe Palace, Starlord Ravenous Wolf released a terrifying blast of light that blasted at Jiuyang.</p>
<p>The Sun God Armor on Jiuyang’s body emitted a divine glow like the sun. When the power of the light blast landed on him, not only did it fail to injure him, but it also made the Sun God Armor even stronger.</p>
<p>This person’s Guardian is rather interesting. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be curious when he saw how magical the Sun God Armor was. It was much stronger than his Fire-Runic Divine Armor Queen. He sized up Jiuyang and the Sun God Armor from the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no idea that the Sun God Armor was created by the Sun God Holy Temple. It was the strongest sun-type Guardian that ordinary Guardians could compare with. Under the Sun God Holy Temple’s full efforts, it was already a Calamity-grade Guardian.</p>
<p>It wasn’t easy for the Sun God Holy Temple to chance upon Jiuyang, who was most compatible with the Sun God Guardian, before bestowing it upon him.</p>
<p>Jiuyang’s status in the Sun God Holy Temple was equivalent to Xiao’s status in the Trajectory Holy Temple.</p>
<p>Jiuyang didn’t disappoint the Sun God Holy Temple’s expectations. The last time he cleared Dubhe Palace, the Sun God Guardian was still at the Human Realm. In just a short span of time, it had already reached the Hell level.</p>
<p>Apart from having the full support of the Sun God Holy Temple, the main reason for that was that Jiuyang’s talent and Life Providence were highly compatible with the Sun God Guardian.</p>
<p>Jiuyang’s trip here was to kill Starlord Ravenous Wolf. He stood in the blast of light as the Sun God armor on his body shone like a blazing sun. He walked towards Starlord Ravenous Wolf against the terrifying blast of light.</p>
<p>Starlord Ravenous Wolf seemed to sense the pressure as he stood up from his throne.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1566'>Chapter 1566: Who’s the Unlucky One?</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to leave through the teleportation nexus, but when he saw that Jiuyang had already begun fighting Starlord Ravenous Wolf, he decided to stand in a corner by the door and watch their battle.</p>
<p>Starlord Ravenous Wolf was a martial repository. No matter what technique he used, it appeared perfect and flawless. It could even be considered stunning.</p>
<p>“I never knew that it could be used this way!” Those who could truly understand Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s battle couldn’t help but praise him from time to time.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had already seen it once, he still found it stunning when he saw it again.</p>
<p>Jiuyang wasn’t at a disadvantage when fighting Starlord Ravenous Wolf. He wasn’t as stunning as Starlord Ravenous Wolf. His every move was standard; they didn’t provide any surprises.</p>
<p>It was like the sun rising in the morning every day before setting in the evening. It was never absent, nor did it bring about surprises.</p>
<p>He was a man that didn’t bring about pleasant surprises or subvert expectations. Yet, his simple techniques were on par with Starlord Ravenous Wolf. No matter how shocking Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s attacks were, it was difficult for him to truly suppress Jiuyang. They were evenly matched.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that due to the Sun God Armor, the high-temperature radiation that Starlord Ravenous Wolf emitted made the Sun God Armor’s power grow stronger.</p>
<p>Starlord Ravenous Wolf had the upper hand for a short period of time, but over time, Jiuyang would definitely hold the advantage.</p>
<p>“As expected of a man with Sun God. He’s really powerful.”</p>
<p>“The Four Dinosaur Kings defeated Starlord Ravenous Wolf four against one. Jiuyang alone can fight Starlord Ravenous Wolf. Furthermore, it looks like he has a chance of winning. This is the difference.”</p>
<p>“In comparison, Unlucky Egg is…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t hear the discussions on the Internet. Even if he could hear it, he wouldn’t take it to heart. He was watching with relish.</p>
<p>This person should be Saint Jiuyang on the rankings, right? I never expected that such a figure would pop up from the Holy Land in such a short period. Zhou Wen watched carefully from the side.</p>
<p>Most of the Saints who came from the Holy Land were enemies. If he could learn more about them now, it would be knowing himself and his enemy before they really fought in the future.</p>
<p>After watching for a while, Zhou Wen felt a heartfelt admiration for Jiuyang.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen many Guardians. The humans who had contracted Guardians were basically focused on developing the abilities of Guardians. They studied how to maximize the strength of the Guardians.</p>
<p>Of course, Jiuyang did the same. However, other than that, he didn’t give up on his cultivation.</p>
<p>His strength came from a Guardian, but his technique and concepts had also reached an extremely high level. Even without the Guardian’s power to support him, his technique and concept remained top-notch.</p>
<p>Where did the Holy Land find these people? Figures like Xiao and Jiuyang are all talented among us humans. What a pity… Zhou Wen felt a little regretful.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these people were Saints from the Holy Land. They were different from Jiang Yan and the other Guardians. Jiang Yan and the others had only contracted Guardians. As long as the Guardians were on their side, they could completely control their fates and not be controlled by the dimension.</p>
<p>The Saints of the Holy Land weren’t that simple. Even if their Guardians were willing to follow them, it would probably be difficult for them to betray the Holy Land.</p>
<p>In any case, Zhou Wen had never heard of the Holy Land having any traitors.</p>
<p>Previously, An Tianzuo had captured a few Saints, but he had failed to dig out anything. Even if there were Saints who were willing to join him, they were later proven to be spies.</p>
<p>The Holy Land’s control over Saints definitely exceeded the imagination of ordinary people.</p>
<p>After watching for a while, Zhou Wen knew that with the Guardian’s strength, Jiuyang would likely win in the end.</p>
<p>There was no point in continuing watching. Zhou Wen floated towards the teleportation nexus, planning on leaving Dubhe Palace and returning to Earth.</p>
<p>Just as he floated forward a few meters, before Zhou Wen could approach the teleportation nexus, he suddenly saw a light flash from the throne. Another Starlord Ravenous Wolf had appeared.</p>
<p>After the second Starlord Ravenous Wolf appeared, he immediately charged down without a word.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was relatively far from the newly-appeared Starlord Ravenous Wolf, the newly-appeared Starlord Ravenous Wolf pounced at Jiuyang, who was relatively close to him.</p>
<p>Jiuyang, who had already gained a slight advantage in a one-on-one battle, was immediately thrown into danger when he was besieged by two Starlord Ravenous Wolves.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? Why are there two Starlord Ravenous Wolves? Previously, the Four Dinosaur Kings attacked Starlord Ravenous Wolf together, but there wasn’t a second Starlord Ravenous Wolf!”</p>
<p>“How can that be the same? The Four Dinosaur Kings are a team, and Unlucky Egg and Jiuyang are actually two different teams. It’s normal for two Starlord Ravenous Wolves to appear.”</p>
<p>“Jiuyang is being besieged by two Starlord Ravenous Wolves. It looks like he won’t be able to last much longer.”</p>
<p>“Why are the two Starlord Ravenous Wolves attacking Jiuyang and not that Unlucky Egg?”</p>
<p>Everyone discussed spiritedly. Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He never expected such a development.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Zhou Wen who hadn’t expected it. Jiuyang was caught by surprise. Although the Sun God Armor could restrain Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s high-temperature radiation blast, Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s other strengths were no trifling matter.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s combat prowess was indomitable. Jiuyang could handle a one-on-one battle, but against two, he immediately fell into a perilous situation. Even if he wanted to rush towards the teleportation nexus, there was no chance.</p>
<p>The second Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s combat strength wasn’t weaker than the first. The two Starlords worked together flawlessly as they constantly suppressed Jiuyang.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Starlord Ravenous Wolf punched Jiuyang’s shoulder. Streams of light over the Sun God Armor shattered as Jiuyang was thrown a few steps back.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Jiuyang’s foundation was sufficiently powerful. The Sun God Armor was indeed powerful. This punch only slightly injured Jiuyang without leaving serious injuries.</p>
<p>Jiuyang stabilized his body and dodged the pursuit of another Starlord Ravenous Wolf. He threw out both fists and exchanged countless punches with the first Starlord Ravenous Wolf. Light blasts and shockwaves erupted continuously, causing the entire hall to rumble as though it was about to collapse.</p>
<p>The two Starlord Ravenous Wolves were like one. Jiuyang retreated under their barrage of attacks.</p>
<p>“Haha, Jiuyang is trapped in his own web. He never expected two Starlord Ravenous Wolves to appear in the arena. From the way the Starlord Ravenous Wolf appeared, if he had killed Zhou Wen outside, the second Starlord Ravenous Wolf probably wouldn’t have appeared,” Xia Liuchuan said gloatingly.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu said with a bitter smile, “Jiuyang might not have thought of it, but neither did we. Thankfully, Jiuyang was ahead. Zhou Wen still has a chance of rushing into the teleportation nexus.. Otherwise, he’ll still be doomed when those two Starlord Ravenous Wolves kill Jiuyang.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1567'>Chapter 1567: Tiger Soul General Appears</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t plan on escaping. He was thinking about which Companion Beast to send.</p>
<p>He originally didn’t plan on fighting, but the situation made it clear that it was almost impossible for Jiuyang to win. At most, he would severely injure Starlord Ravenous Wolf or kill one in exchange for his life.</p>
<p>It was a waste not to pick up such a bargain. After all, this was the Calamity-grade Starlord Ravenous Wolf. In-game, Zhou Wen might have to clear all the dungeons in the Big Dipper instance dungeon before he would respawn again. Two of them had now appeared in real life. If a Companion Beast dropped, he would be making a killing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen planned on finishing off the two Starlord Ravenous Wolves when Jiuyang was at his wits’ end.</p>
<p>Which Companion Beast should I send? The Golden Wyrm Scissors makes it too obvious. It’s more suitable to keep it as a trump card. After some thought, Zhou Wen planned on letting the Tiger Soul General who had just advanced to the Calamity grade fight.</p>
<p>The Tiger Soul General was extremely suitable for the Big Dipper dimensional zone. He definitely needed it to appear in the future. It was only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Tiger Soul General’s appearance was very different from before. Even people who had seen it in the past would definitely not recognize it.</p>
<p>After all, ordinary people didn’t have the ability to fuse Companion Beasts, nor could they imagine that a Companion Beast would undergo such a huge change. They wouldn’t associate it with the same Companion Beast. At most, they would think that it was a Companion Beast of the same type.</p>
<p>I’ll let the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General get some training then. With a thought, Zhou Wen summoned the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>After all, it needed to gather strength ahead of time. Only then would it be unbeatable. Being at the Human Realm, it would have to waste time gathering strength to kill Starlord Ravenous Wolf.</p>
<p>After the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General appeared, it was struck by high-temperature radiation and light blasts. The flames within his body immediately burned vigorously as though something was swimming in its armor.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen got the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to stand beside him while waiting for an opportunity to attack.</p>
<p>The spectators were greatly surprised when they saw a Companion Beast appear beside Unlucky Egg. They couldn’t help but size it up.</p>
<p>Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General now looked pretty cool. Its entire appearance was extremely imposing, like a mechanical warrior riding a mechanical tiger. Its body was still burning with terrifying flames. In its hand was an odd-looking spear that seemed high-tech. Its entire appearance was like a high-tech mecha knight from the future world.</p>
<p>“What Companion Beast is that? It looks very cool.”</p>
<p>“What’s the point of looking good? Don’t you see that Unlucky Egg doesn’t dare let it attack?”</p>
<p>“Currently, no Companion Beast owned by humans can fight a Calamity-grade creature, right?”</p>
<p>“Since it can withstand the high-temperature radiation, it should be at the Terror grade.”</p>
<p>“From the flames on his body, I can tell that he’s a fire-elemental Companion Beast. It’s not surprising that he can withstand high-temperature radiation.”</p>
<p>“Professor Gu, what do you think of the Companion Beast summoned by Unlucky Egg? Can you determine its level?” The host, Su Yi, chatted with Professor Gu on the program.</p>
<p>“Based on his appearance and the abilities he displayed, he should be at the Terror grade at the very least. However, the possibility of him being at the Calamity grade isn’t high,” Professor Gu said.</p>
<p>“Why? Is it because humans do not have Calamity-grade Companion Beasts yet?” Su Yi asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Professor Gu smiled and said, “There are already Calamity-grade Companion Beasts among humans. It’s something I’ve seen with my own eyes, but it’s not the time to reveal which Companion Beast. However, I’m certain that it’s not the one on the screen. Furthermore, if Unlucky Egg has a Calamity-grade Companion Beast that can fight Starlord Ravenous Wolf, he wouldn’t have tried heading for the teleportation nexus. Previously, he had already decided to give up and leave. This means that he doesn’t have the confidence to fight. Therefore, I’m guessing that the Companion Beast isn’t at the Calamity grade. It’s most likely at the Terror grade.”</p>
<p>“I see. Since it’s only a Terror-grade Companion Beast and can’t fight Starlord Ravenous Wolf, what’s the point of summoning it now?” Su Yi asked again.</p>
<p>“It’s naturally difficult for a Terror-grade Companion Beast to fight a Calamity-grade creature. However, if Saint Jiuyang and the two Starlord Ravenous Wolves fight to an internecine outcome, he might still stand a chance,” Professor Gu said.</p>
<p>“Are you saying that Unlucky Egg wants to pick up the spoils? Is that possible?” Su Yi said in surprise.</p>
<p>“Although the chances aren’t high, if he succeeds, he might be able to kill two Calamity-grade creatures in one fell swoop. If he’s lucky, he will be elevated to success once a Companion Egg drops. After all, such an opportunity can’t be encountered at any time. Without Saint Jiuyang, there wouldn’t be such a chance. It’s normal for some people to be blinded by huge benefits,” Professor Gu said.</p>
<p>“Then can Unlucky Egg clinch this rare opportunity? Let’s wait and see.” Su Yi was also very curious about the outcome.</p>
<p>The people watching the program were crazily commenting on this matter. Most people believed that Unlucky Egg was taking too much risk. The chances of success were too low, so the best choice was to take the opportunity to teleport away. Otherwise, he might very well die there.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>Two consecutive attacks landed on Jiuyang, causing the Sun God armor on his body to dim. Cracks crisscrossed the armor.</p>
<p>Must I use that power? Jiuyang felt a little bitter. He had always been unwilling to use that power because it made him feel like a puppet without any value.</p>
<p>Therefore, he would rather use his own techniques to fight than use that power.</p>
<p>But at this point, he no longer had a choice.</p>
<p>“Do you need help?” Jiuyang suddenly heard a voice and couldn’t help but be taken aback.</p>
<p>Although he had been fighting with all his might, he didn’t give up on monitoring Zhou Wen to prevent him from causing trouble while he was fighting.</p>
<p>Jiuyang had also seen Zhou Wen summon the Tiger Soul General. Like Professor Gu and most people, he believed that Zhou Wen wanted to take advantage of the situation when he and the Starlord Ravenous Wolves were mutually injured.</p>
<p>Although Jiuyang knew that he wouldn’t give Zhou Wen such a chance, he never expected Zhou Wen to say such words.</p>
<p>Jiuyang’s heart stirred as he temporarily gave up on using that power. As he fought bitterly, he asked, “How are you going to help me?”</p>
<p>“Get out of the way,” Zhou Wen said as he ordered the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to charge at the Starlord Ravenous Wolves.</p>
<p>This place was very suitable for the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. During this period of time, the power accumulated by the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General had reached a level that surprised Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The high temperature and energy blasts of Dubhe, as well as Starlord Ravenous Wolves’ blasts of light, gave the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General time to quickly accumulate the energy of the demonic flames in its body.</p>
<p>Now, the terrifying demonic flames in the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s body were like a bomb that could explode at any moment.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1568'>Chapter 1568: The Might of the Tiger Soul General</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Flames burned over the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General as he charged at the Starlord Ravenous Wolves like an unbridled horse.</p>
<p>Everyone was taken aback. They originally imagined that Unlucky Egg merely wanted to pick up the spoils, but now, it clearly wasn’t time.</p>
<p>What is he doing? Does he really want to help me by getting the Companion Beast to rush forward at this moment? Jiuyang was somewhat puzzled. He didn’t know what the other party was thinking. He highly doubted that he would really help him.</p>
<p>However, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General had already charged forward. As Jiuyang was momentarily at a loss as to what Zhou Wen meant, he failed to immediately work in tandem with the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>The two Starlord Ravenous Wolves attacked the Tiger Soul General from both sides. Their fists carried terrifying high temperatures and radiation, as well as powerful explosive power.</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was attacked from both sides. It looked like it couldn’t deal with the attacks.</p>
<p>In fact, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General couldn’t be bothered with the attacks. He ignored the Starlord Ravenous Wolf on the left. The spear in his hand carried a violent purple flame as it struck at Starlord Ravenous Wolf on the right.</p>
<p>This attack risked one’s life. There was no technique to speak of. It depended on who was faster and stronger.</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was clearly a little slower. The Starlord Ravenous Wolves were a little faster and were relatively more agile. The fists of the one on the left struck it.</p>
<p>The Starlord Ravenous Wolf on the right dodged the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s spear. After getting close, his fist also struck it.</p>
<p>Four punches struck the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s body simultaneously. Immediately, blinding light and a shockwave that resembled a supernova erupted.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Wen and Jiuyang found the light blinding. They could hardly see anything as the shockwave sent their bodies retreating.</p>
<p>The humans watching the Cube’s live broadcast found it even harder to see what was happening. The screen was filled with blinding light.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, that Companion Beast is doomed. To be struck by two Starlord Ravenous Wolves at the same time, even Jiuyang can’t withstand such destructive power, right?</p>
<p>Most people had such thoughts. Such a terrifying attack was probably unbearable even for a Calamity-grade Companion Beast, much less a Terror-grade Companion Beast.</p>
<p>When the dazzling light gradually weakened, everyone immediately widened their eyes. They saw the Starlord Ravenous Wolves’ fists strike the Tiger Soul General from both sides. However, the Tiger Soul General remained standing proudly. The armor on his body wasn’t shattered by their strikes. Instead, the flames in his body looked even more turbulent. The beautiful patterns on his armor became even more dazzling.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The Tiger Soul General waved the spear in his hand and swept it from left to right. The Starlord Ravenous Wolf on the right reached out to grab the spear, but the moment his palm touched it, he immediately felt a huge force repel him as his body involuntarily flew backward and slammed into the Starlord Ravenous Wolf on the left.</p>
<p>The two Starlord Ravenous Wolves immediately collided and tumbled out together.</p>
<p>The Tiger Soul General charged forward on his mount. The spear in his hand danced like a dragon as he charged at the two Starlord Ravenous Wolves.</p>
<p>Everyone was already stunned. The Tiger Soul General was fighting two alone, but it continued charging forward. The Starlord Ravenous Wolves’ attacks only sent the Tiger Soul General retreating, but their armors would crack whenever the Tiger Soul General struck them.</p>
<p>The Tiger Soul General hardly dodged the Starlord Ravenous Wolves’ attacks. Relying on its powerful physique and defense, it sent the two Starlord Ravenous Wolves into a retreating defeat.</p>
<p>“This cannot be happening, right? That Companion Beast can actually ignore the Starlord Ravenous Wolves’ attacks?”</p>
<p>“This is crazy!”</p>
<p>“What Companion Beast is that? It’s ridiculously strong. Humans actually have such powerful Companion Beasts?”</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, who is this Unlucky Egg? His Companion Beast is too amazing!”</p>
<p>The Tiger Soul General charged at the Starlord Ravenous Wolves like a ferocious general fighting a mere foot soldier. The two Starlords could only constantly dodge. It was difficult for them to fight it head-on.</p>
<p>Jiuyang watched in a daze as the Tiger Soul General fought the Starlord Ravenous Wolves. This situation completely exceeded his expectations. He was momentarily unsure if he should continue fighting.</p>
<p>After some hesitation, Jiuyang gave up on the idea of charging forward to fight. If he were to fight now, it would be him taking advantage of Zhou Wen. Jiuyang clearly felt that it was beneath him to do such a thing.</p>
<p>Who is he? Jiuyang stared at the Chaos Egg as his eyes emitted a sun-like glow. He wanted to see who was inside, but he couldn’t see anything.</p>
<p>Even if his eyes could see through things, it was impossible for him to see through the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>The Tiger Soul General was like a devil general from hell as it constantly charged forward. The Starlord Ravenous Wolves, who had been arrogant and unbridled, appeared to be on the brink of collapse under the Tiger Soul General’s onslaught. It was like a battle between a child and an adult. They could hardly put up a defense.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Wen never expected the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to be that ferocious. He was clearly at the Human Realm, while the Starlord Ravenous Wolves were likely at the Hell level.</p>
<p>Ignoring the difference in level, it was truly terrifying for it to completely suppress two Starlord Ravenous Wolves in a one-on-two situation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew very well that the reason the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was so strong was partly that of the environment in Dubhe Palace. Also, the Starlord Ravenous Wolves’ abilities were high temperature in nature, so they were actually restrained by the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General became stronger the more it fought. In the beginning, the Starlord Ravenous Wolves’ attacks could still push it back a distance. Later on, they could hardly push him back by more than two steps.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was like a ferocious tiger out in the wild. With the violent flames, he penetrated a Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s chest and nailed him to the ground.</p>
<p>The other Starlord Ravenous Wolf brandished his fists crazily from behind and punched the back of the Tiger Soul General’s head again and again. However, the violent attacks failed to even crack the Tiger Soul General’s helmet.</p>
<p>The Tiger Soul General swung his hand backward and grabbed the Starlord Ravenous Wolf by the neck and lifted him in front of him.</p>
<p>Starlord Ravenous Wolf used his hands and feet to attack the Tiger Soul General with all his might. However, the Tiger Soul General seemed oblivious to his explosive strength. With a sudden squeeze of his palm, he snapped Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s neck.</p>
<p>A head fell from the neck and the body lost its vitality as its limbs went limp.</p>
<p>The Starlord Ravenous Wolf, who had been nailed to the ground, struggled to get up, but he was held down by the spear.</p>
<p>The Tiger Soul General glanced at him and flicked the spear in his hand, lifting the Starlord Ravenous Wolf and sending him flying.</p>
<p>While Starlord Ravenous Wolf was still in midair, the spearhead of the Tiger Soul General’s spear shot out tracers like a Gatling’s barrel.</p>
<p>The shooting-star-like tracers constantly struck Starlord Ravenous Wolf in the air.. This continued for dozens of seconds before his body exploded.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1569'>Chapter 1569: Here Comes the Companion Beast</h3>
<p>A Companion Egg dropped from Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s shattered body. Zhou Wen immediately saw the Companion Egg thanks to his good eyesight. He got the Tiger Soul General to grab it and return to his side.</p>
<p>“A Calamity-grade Companion Egg!” Many people watching the live broadcast were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“There’s no justice in this world. He already has such a powerful Companion Beast, but now, he has Starlord Ravenous Wolf drop. Could it be like that old adage, the rich get richer?”</p>
<p>“Damn it, why would a Companion Egg drop! Why is Zhou Wen so lucky with Companion Beasts! Among the top human powerhouses, he’s probably the only one who can fight simply using Companion Beasts.” Xia Liuchuan also wailed.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu smiled and said, “This is fate. You can’t be envious.”</p>
<p>“A Starlord Ravenous Wolf Companion Beast. Professor Gu, this should be the first Calamity-grade Companion Egg that the Federation’s citizens know of, right?” Su Yi asked Professor Gu.</p>
<p>Professor Gu still seemed to be in a daze. Only when he heard Su Yi’s question did he snap to his senses. He said expressionlessly, “It’s indeed the first Calamity-grade Companion Egg that the Federation citizens have seen with their own eyes. However, to people who already have such powerful Companion Beasts, the Starlord Ravenous Wolf Companion Beast can only be considered icing on the cake. That Companion Beast is rather powerful. Not only is it at the Calamity grade, but it’s also not an ordinary one…”</p>
<p>The screen was filled with sarcastic comments while Professor Gu commented.</p>
<p>“Professor Gu, didn’t you insist that the Companion Beast is definitely at the Terror grade?”</p>
<p>“Elder Gu, that’s not what you said just now!”</p>
<p>In Luoyang’s An family, An Sheng said with a look of delight, “Young Master Wen’s Companion Beast luck is really good. He has another Calamity-grade Companion Beast. With just his Companion Beasts, he might be invincible in the Federation.”</p>
<p>“Invincible in the Federation? Don’t speak too soon,” An Tianzuo said with a cold snort.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and company were envious. “Zhou Wen really has it easy when it comes to Companion Beasts.”</p>
<p>“This doesn’t seem easy at all, right?” Female Sword Immortal Qin Zhen said.</p>
<p>“It’s far from easy. Coach is perhaps the only one in the Federation to be capable of defeating two Starlord Ravenous Wolves with only Companion Beasts,” Ming Xiu said with admiration.</p>
<p>Another heated debate about Companion Beasts stirred in the Federation.</p>
<p>In recent years, although people had been using Companion Beasts, people believed that they were ultimately inferior to Guardians. This was because top humans basically used Guardians to fight. Otherwise, they took Mythical Serums. Although Companion Beasts were used, they were not the main force in high-end battles. They only provided support in combat.</p>
<p>It was very rare for someone like Zhou Wen to produce such results purely using a Companion Beast. Or rather, he was the only one at present.</p>
<p>People once again realized that top-notch Companion Beasts weren’t weaker than any creature.</p>
<p>Jiuyang looked at the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General with a strange expression.</p>
<p>This was the first time he had seen such a powerful Companion Beast. Although he also had the ability to hunt Calamity-grade creatures, he didn’t focus on hunting dimensional creatures and obtaining Companion Beasts. This was because he always felt that his strength was key. Companion Beasts were like Guardians—external forces.</p>
<p>However, after seeing the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General today, he had to admit that such external forces were indeed a little strong.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to fantasize. He led the Tiger Soul General towards the teleportation nexus and quickly vanished.</p>
<p>When Jiuyang saw Zhou Wen leave, he imagined that he had teleported away, so he wasn’t in the mood to stay any longer. He chose to teleport away and return to the Cube.</p>
<p>However, when Jiuyang looked back at the Cube, he was surprised to discover that Zhou Wen hadn’t left the Star Palace. The Cube’s footage continued. The Chaos Egg and the Tiger Soul General were still on the Cube’s screen.</p>
<p>However, the scene was no longer Dubhe Palace, but another Star Palace he had never seen before.</p>
<p>“What’s that? What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“Another Star Palace. It looks different from Dubhe Palace.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it over after killing Starlord Ravenous Wolf? Why is there another Star Palace?”</p>
<p>People watched the Cube’s live broadcast in surprise as they guessed what was going on. As for some people with more imagination, they seemed to have guessed what it was.</p>
<p>“Could it be that the dimensional zone this time isn’t just Dubhe Palace, but a serial dimensional zone?”</p>
<p>“No way? In that case, don’t tell me the Big Dipper has a dimensional zone for each star? Only by clearing seven dimensional zones will it be considered true clearance?”</p>
<p>“That must be the case. Do you still remember? After clearing the Venusian dimensional zone, there were Companion Eggs that could be obtained. However, nothing appeared after clearing Dubhe Palace. That means that they didn’t really clear it.”</p>
<p>“This Star Palace is ranked behind Dubhe Palace. It should be Merak Star Palace, right? In that case, the dimensional creature here should be Starlord Titan Gate, right?”</p>
<p>There were still many talents in the Federation. Many people had already guessed it correctly.</p>
<p>However, there were already people who began to worry for Zhou Wen. This was because the Merak Star Palace was an unknown Star Palace. The dimensional creature inside was also unknown.</p>
<p>If Unlucky Egg encountered an accident because he wasn’t familiar with the dimensional creature inside, it wouldn’t be worth it.</p>
<p>“Old Zhang, you’re impressive. Your guess is really accurate. This is indeed a serial dimensional zone. The second Star Palace is undoubtedly Merak.” Xia Liuchuan gave Zhang Chunqiu a thumbs up.</p>
<p>“It’s just basic inference,” Zhang Chunqiu said. “However, isn’t Zhou Wen being a little too rash? The abilities and stats of the dimensional creature in Merak Star Palace are definitely different from Starlord Ravenous Wolf. If he takes the risk to enter, it will be a serious loss for us humans if anything happens.”</p>
<p>Professor Gu also made a similar statement. “This person is clearly letting it get to his head. He thinks that a powerful Companion Beast can resolve all problems. This is a common mistake. Different Companion Beasts should be used against different dimensional creatures…”</p>
<p>While Professor Gu was still explaining in detail, the Tiger Soul General had already rushed through the Merak Star Palace’s door, heading straight into the Star Palace.</p>
<p>Others might not understand Merak Star Palace, but Zhou Wen knew it very well. Starlord Titan Gate was very strong, but he was only equal to Starlord Ravenous Wolf. The Tiger Soul General had already accumulated enough strength. He was much stronger than when he killed Starlord Ravenous Wolf.</p>
<p>The current Tiger Soul General was enough to instantly kill Starlord Titan Gate.</p>
<p>The huge Starlord Titan Gate stood up. His body made the people watching the livestream gasp. Compared to him, the Tiger Soul General was like an ant versus an elephant. It looked much weaker..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1570'>Chapter 1570: Egg Sovereign</h3>
<p>1</p>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>While everyone was still reeling in shock from Starlord Titan Gate’s powerful aura and size, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General had already rushed over.</p>
<p>Starlord Titan Gate opened his mouth, but before he could release the sound wave, the spear emitted a terrifying flaming bullet.</p>
<p>Rumble!</p>
<p>The meteor-like purple flaming bullets spewed into Starlord Titan Gate’s mouth. In a few seconds, his head exploded.</p>
<p>The huge body collapsed like a mountain, shaking the entire Star Palace for a while.</p>
<p>“Different Companion Beasts target… Yes…” Before Professor Gu could finish his sentence, he couldn’t close his mouth.</p>
<p>The entire Federation fell silent for a few seconds before the Internet broke out into a frenzy. The screen was flooded with all sorts of messages, blocking the live broadcast’s footage.</p>
<p>“He’s practically invincible!”</p>
<p>“Too f*cking strong!”</p>
<p>“Your Excellency Egg Sovereign, please accept my bow.”</p>
<p>“I’m willing to use my ten years of lifespan to exchange for that Companion Beast.”</p>
<p>“Egg Sovereign is awesome, Brother Tiger is awesome!”</p>
<p>Many people on the Internet liked to give all sorts of nicknames. Soon, Unlucky Egg from before was replaced by Egg Sovereign. They didn’t know the name of the Tiger Soul General, but from the aura that resembled a ferocious tiger out in the wild and how the mount that the creature sat on looked like a tiger, they gave him the nickname “Brother Tiger.”</p>
<p>There were many other nicknames, but these two were most acceptable by the masses. They quickly spread.</p>
<p>“Egg Sovereign, continue clearing the levels. Clear all the Big Dipper dimensional zones.”</p>
<p>“Brother Tiger is so impressive. What dimensional creature can’t he kill? Finish it.”</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan and Zhang Chunqiu exchanged looks and saw the surprise in each other’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast is ridiculously strong,” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>“It’s indeed a little ridiculous.” Zhang Chunqiu suddenly thought of something. He picked up his phone and called Zhang Yuzhi. “Yuzhi, don’t you want to go out for a walk…”</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan glanced at Zhang Chunqiu in contempt as he thought smugly to himself, You, Zhang Chunqiu, claim to be good at divination. So that’s all you amount to. Looks like I’m the wise one. I’ve long sent Little Yue to Guide City.</p>
<p>Jiuyang was also shocked by the strength of the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. Although he didn’t know what level Starlord Titan Gate was, being behind Starlord Ravenous Wolf meant that it was impossible for him to be weaker than Starlord Ravenous Wolf. Yet, he was instantly killed. It wasn’t because Starlord Titan Gate was weak, but because the Tiger Soul General was too powerful.</p>
<p>Jiuyang didn’t look at the Tiger Soul General again. Instead, he looked at the Chaos Egg and muttered to himself, “Interesting. I really want to know what level that person is at to possess such a powerful Companion Beast.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t care. He got the Tiger Soul General to continue blasting apart Starlord Titan Gate’s body as a few crystals dropped. One of them was crystalline like jade. There was Starlord Titan Gate’s shadow inside—a skill crystal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t stand on ceremony as he got the Tiger Soul General to pick up all the crystals before rushing into the teleportation nexus.</p>
<p>Many people were looking forward to the egg emperor and Brother Tiger clearing the seven levels and completing the Big Dipper dimensional zone.</p>
<p>However, they were disappointed. Zhou Wen teleported out of the dimensional zone with the Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>He wasn’t stupid. The third Star Palace’s Starlord wasn’t someone who could be resolved with brute force. Although the Tiger Soul General was strong, it was useless against that Starlord.</p>
<p>The stronger the destructive power of the Tiger Soul General, the faster he would die.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen teleported out, the Cube’s screen switched to a ranking. A new name was placed first.</p>
<p>“Tiger Soul General! That must be the name of that Companion Beast, right?” When people saw the name, they were first taken aback before they reacted.</p>
<p>“Tiger Soul General is so strong. Why didn’t he let him continue clearing the levels?”</p>
<p>“Egg Sovereign is way too cowardly, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“It’s really a waste to have such a powerful Companion Beast follow him.”</p>
<p>Many people were displeased with Zhou Wen quitting at this moment. From their point of view, even if the Tiger Soul General couldn’t clear the seven levels, it wouldn’t be a problem for him to clear two or three more. It was a little cowardly to quit now.</p>
<p>There was something else that surprised everyone. Although Jiuyang didn’t perform as well as Zhou Wen, he was already very strong. However, his name had vanished from the rankings.</p>
<p>Originally, even if the Tiger Soul General entered the rankings, Jiuyang would at most drop one spot. Now, his name had completely vanished. People guessed that it had something to do with the previous PVP mode.</p>
<p>Jiuyang himself had already seen the notification on the Cube. As he had lost in the PVP mode, he would not be able to enter the dimensional zone through the Cube for a month.</p>
<p>“Jiuyang, why didn’t you use that item?” Holy God walked over from afar and arrived behind Jiuyang.</p>
<p>“Greetings, Lord Holy God.” Jiuyang genuflected and bowed at Holy God.</p>
<p>“Answer me,” Holy God said again.</p>
<p>“It was my oversight. I originally thought that I didn’t need to use that item. I never expected such an accident to happen.” Jiuyang looked up and asked, “Lord Holy God, do you know who that Egg Sovereign is?”</p>
<p>“So what if I know?” Holy God said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Lord Holy God, please inform him that I wish to meet him in person,” said Jiuyang.</p>
<p>“Sure, but I have a request. Bring him back to the Holy Land. If you can’t do it, there’s no need to know,” said Holy God.</p>
<p>“Why do you need him to be brought back?” Jiuyang asked.</p>
<p>“Because he’s an enemy of the Holy Land,” said Holy God.</p>
<p>“He’s Zhou Wen?” Jiuyang suddenly thought of something and blurted out.</p>
<p>“You aren’t too stupid. According to the information we gathered previously, that egg-shaped ability is an ability that Zhou Wen once used. We haven’t discovered anyone with a similar ability, so we are certain that it’s him,” Holy God said. “Bring him back to the Holy Land. It’s best if you can capture him alive. If you can’t, bring back his corpse.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Lord Holy God.” After a moment of silence, Jiuyang stood up and bowed before turning to leave.</p>
<p>“Godsfall.” Holy God softly called out a name after seeing Jiuyang disappear from his vision.</p>
<p>“Lord Holy God, what are your orders?” A young man in gorgeous armor who looked like a prince walked in front of Holy God and knelt down.</p>
<p>“Follow Jiuyang secretly. If Jiuyang doesn’t complete the mission, you will take over,” said Holy God.</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Excellency. I definitely won’t disappoint you.” The corners of Godsfall’s mouth curled up slightly as he revealed a strange smile. His handsome face made one shudder.</p>
<p>“You have another mission. Bring Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast back, especially that Tiger Soul General. You have to bring it back,” Holy God emphasized twice.</p>
<p>Godsfall answered with a smile, “Lord Holy God, don’t worry. This is what I’m best at. It won’t just be the Tiger Soul General.. I’ll bring back all of Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts.”</p>

<p>After Zhou Wen came out of the teleportation nexus, he indeed arrived on Merak Star. Beside him was the Cube. He would find himself back at the Cube he used if he were to use it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally didn’t need to return. He directly used Singularity Universe to teleport back to Earth.</p>
<p>I’m finally back. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief when he saw the familiar scenery.</p>
<p>Although living outside didn’t adversely affect him, he still felt comfortable at home.</p>
<p>This was already within the range of Guide City, but it was still a distance from the city. Zhou Wen instant transmitted and returned to his yard.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, you’re finally back,” said Li Xuan—who lived beside him—with a grin when he came over to check due to the commotion.</p>
<p>“It’s only been a few days. You make it sound like I’ve been away for a few years. Nothing happened here, right?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“With me around, what can happen?” Li Xuan seemed to think of something as he changed the topic and continued with a smile, “I forgot. Something did happen.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” Zhou Wen wasn’t flustered at all. Li Xuan’s tone didn’t sound urgent.</p>
<p>“Xia Xuanyue came to Guide City,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Why is she here?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He had a deep impression of Xia Xuanyue.</p>
<p>The Demonic Sword in Demonic Neonate’s hand originally belonged to Xia Xuanyue. Furthermore, after what happened to Xia Jiuhuang, it was difficult not to remember her.</p>
<p>“The claim is that she’s here to see if we can do some business. I think she’s here for you. Otherwise, in this crappy place of ours, what business can the dignified eldest daughter of the Xia family do here?” Li Xuan nudged Zhou Wen with his elbow and said with a knowing expression, “Aren’t you still single? I think this eldest daughter of the Xia family is pretty good. Although she’s a little older than you, she’s beautiful. Besides, as the saying goes, a wife three years older than the husband ensures a richer life.”</p>
<p>“What nonsense are you spouting? I’ve only met Xia Xuanyue a few times. I’m not familiar with her at all.” Zhou Wen was at a loss whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>Li Xuan chuckled and said, “You’ll soon get to know each other, and before you know it, you’ll be bedding her.”</p>
<p>“Don’t spout nonsense. It’s not good if she hears you.” Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to waste his breath on Li Xuan. He pondered and said, “What do you think she’s doing here? Is she friend or foe?”</p>
<p>“My take is that she doesn’t seem to have any ill intentions. I reckon the Xia family finds us promising and wants to make a bet ahead of time,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, we can let her stay. If we really build a city in the future, we will definitely need to connect to other cities. The Xia family has a deep background and plenty of resources. It’s not a bad choice to become partners.” Zhou Wen had a good impression of the Xia siblings.</p>
<p>“She’s been here for days. Do you want to meet her?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“Where is she?” Zhou Wen felt that he should meet Xia Xuanyue. It was best if he could clearly figure out why she was here.</p>
<p>“She’s staying in a hotel in the city. I originally prepared a place for her to stay, but she said that she wanted to tour the area, so she didn’t stay here.” Li Xuan paused before continuing, “Recently, she has been circling the nearby dimensional zones. She’s probably carrying out an inspection.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll do some packing now and find her later.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he placed Demonic Neonate on the bed, took a shower, and changed his clothes.</p>
<p>By the time Zhou Wen came out, Li Xuan had already left. Although the city was nominally theirs, Li Xuan had been the one worrying about various matters. Even if Zhou Wen wanted to chat with him, Li Xuan really didn’t have the time.</p>
<p>He took out Starlord Ravenous Wolf and looked at its stats.</p>
<p>Starlord Ravenous Wolf: Calamity (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Big Dipper Dubhe</p>
<p>Life Soul: Ravenous Wolf</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Omnipotent</p>
<p>Terror Form: Starlord Reincarnation (S-grade)</p>
<p>Calamity Zone: Starlight Zone (Hell-level)</p>
<p>Strength: 200</p>
<p>Speed: 200</p>
<p>Constitution: 200</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 200</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Starjewel, Wolf Devourer, Martial Path Heavenly Book.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Ring</p>
<p>Zhou Wen checked Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s stats carefully and couldn’t help but be slightly taken aback. Typically, only some special Companion Beasts, such as Banana Fairy and Truth Listener would have their stats at the minimum after evolving to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>It wasn’t surprising that Starlord Ravenous Wolf had an Evolvable attribute. However, its attributes were the lowest at the Hell level. This was intriguing.</p>
<p>Typical wild Companion Eggs wouldn’t have their values at the starting value. Starlord Ravenous Wolf having such stats meant that he wasn’t ordinary at all.</p>
<p>In that case, the Starlords in every domain are actually in their most basic form. There should still be plenty of room for growth. Zhou Wen thought again. Don’t tell me the Starlords of the Big Dipper are in the form of rings? Perhaps they can even form a set.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was only musing. He also knew that it was too difficult to have seven Starlord Companion Beasts drop.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen had already seen Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s appearance and abilities, he summoned him in the form of a ring.</p>
<p>A star ring appeared on Zhou Wen’s finger. The surface of the ring was a star that emitted a starlight halo that enveloped Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>What’s the use of this ring? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled. He tried a few times and realized that the starlight wasn’t a protective shield. It couldn’t stop external forces from invading.</p>
<p>With a thought, he took out his phone and entered the Big Dipper instance dungeon. Zhou Wen immediately knew what use the halo had.</p>
<p>With this ring, the high temperature and radiation on Dubhe were ineffective against him. Furthermore, Dubhe’s power was constantly gushing into the ring. The ring served as a conduit, making Zhou Wen feel as though infinite power was coursing through his body.</p>
<p>This ability was only effective on Dubhe, but it was useless in other Star Palaces.</p>
<p>This thing is only useful on Dubhe. I can’t stay on Dubhe forever, right? It’s impossible for me to invite people to Dubhe every time I fight. Zhou Wen found the ring’s ability somewhat useless.</p>
<p>However, Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s combat strength was still very strong. He didn’t need to appear in his companion form.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen packed his things and thought for a moment before picking up the sleeping Demonic Neonate and taking her with him.</p>
<p>He didn’t know what was happening with Demonic Neonate. Zhou Wen was afraid that things would be bad if something alarmed her while he wasn’t by her side.</p>
<p>He carried Demonic Neonate out and headed for Xia Xuanyue’s hotel.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>What Xia Xuanyue had seen in Guide City over the past few days shocked her.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue and Xia Liuchuan originally believed that investing in Guide City now was providing timely help.</p>
<p>However, the situation in Guide City was very different from what they had imagined.</p>
<p>Apart from Li Xuan, there were also Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan who were helping Zhou Wen. The two of them were rather famous in the Federation, but according to the Xia family’s intelligence, their strength was much greater than their fame.</p>
<p>Now that they were here, it meant that their families had already chosen to invest in Guide City and Zhou Wen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1572'>Chapter 1572: A Secret</h3>
<p>What surprised Xia Xuanyue even more was that the famous Female Sword Immortal, Qin Zhen, was also here.</p>
<p>Qin Zhen’s fame wasn’t as great as Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan’s, but there was a reason why Xia Xuanyue knew her.</p>
<p>Qin Zhen came from an average family, but in the past few years of studying at Sunset College, she had displayed extremely powerful talent in the way of the sword.</p>
<p>The various factions thought highly of a genius without any background like Qin Zhen. Who didn’t want to have a few talented sword masters like Qin Zhen under their wing? Even if they funded her with her doing nothing, it was better than having such a strong person serve their enemies.</p>
<p>When Qin Zhen was in her sophomore year, many families had already contacted her. It wasn’t just the typical wealthy family. Even the six families had contacted her—both openly and secretly—and had made some offers.</p>
<p>The Xia family had also invited Qin Zhen. The conditions offered were rather high, but Qin Zhen still rejected them.</p>
<p>Later, Xia Xuanyue learned that the conditions offered by the other families were pretty good. The Family Clan of Gods had even prepared a Guardian and Mythical Serum for her. They were all attributes that best suited her. They also earmarked a large number of resources for her usage.</p>
<p>However, Qin Zhen didn’t go anywhere. She rejected everyone’s invitation and stayed at Sunset College as a tutor.</p>
<p>People originally believed that Qin Zhen had stayed in Sunset College because of An Tianzuo. Many young geniuses had chosen to join Luoyang or directly join the Sunset Army because of the name ‘An Tianzuo.’</p>
<p>Only two days ago, when Xia Xuanyue chanced upon Qin Zhen lecturing students on the school field, did she realize that she was in Guide City.</p>
<p>The conditions here were worlds apart from what the six families had to offer. She really couldn’t figure out why Qin Zhen had chosen to stay here.</p>
<p>Could it be that Qin Zhen thinks so highly of Zhou Wen? Xia Xuanyue thought to herself.</p>
<p>As large families, they definitely couldn’t place all their eggs in one basket. Even if one basket had a problem, there were still eggs in the other basket that could be eaten.</p>
<p>However, Qin Zhen was different. She was only one egg—herself—so it was equivalent to her betting everything on Guide City and Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>What surprised Xia Xuanyue even more was that she saw Hui Wan when she was shopping yesterday.</p>
<p>President Hui Haifeng only had one son. He took care of him like he was a treasure. The present situation in Guide City wasn’t optimistic, but Hui Haifeng didn’t mind leaving his only son here. It left Xia Xuanyue somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>Could this Hui Wan not be Hui Haifeng’s biological son? Xia Xuanyue was very suspicious.</p>
<p>The situation in Guide City was completely different from what Xia Xuanyue had imagined. She was already somewhat in a dilemma, unsure if the conditions she and Xia Liuchuan had come up with could move Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>If this place was only a piece of charcoal, the conditions they offered were rather good. However, from the looks of it, Zhou Wen didn’t seem to need any. It wouldn’t be that easy to convince him.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue called and told Xia Liuchuan what had happened. After Xia Liuchuan heard that, his face was filled with disbelief.</p>
<p>“The Ming Xiu you’re talking about is Swordsman Tomorrow Ming Xiu? And the Feng Qiuyan is the one from the Sea Return family?” Xia Liuchuan asked in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Yes, I heard that they were classmates with Zhou Wen.” Xia Xuanyue recounted what she had heard.</p>
<p>“Not only do Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu represent themselves, but they also represent their families. Although these two families can’t be considered top-notch, they have become famous among the various warlords after the appearance of these two,” Xia Liuchuan said after some thought.</p>
<p>Together with Qin Zhen and some others, Guide City’s strength far exceeded their expectations.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, we have to change our previous plans. The chips in the past could be considered a timely help to the former Zhou Wen, but things aren’t the same now. We are a step too late. We need to raise our chips,” Xia Liuchuan said with a sigh.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen arrived at the hotel, Xia Xuanyue had just returned. The two of them met in the hotel lobby.</p>
<p>“Miss Xia, can you get used to this place?” Zhou Wen walked over and asked.</p>
<p>“It’s not bad; it’s quite quiet.” Xia Xuanyue smiled and said, “If you have the time, let’s find a place to chat?”</p>
<p>“There’s a meeting room upstairs,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to be so formal. My brother is in charge of the family’s matters. I’m only a messenger. It’s almost meal time. I heard that there’s a shop nearby that makes roasted meat using a secret recipe that’s pretty good. I was just thinking about trying it someday. Shall we try it together?” Xia Xuanyue said.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen nodded in agreement and followed Xia Xuanyue to the barbecue shop.</p>
<p>After the two of them ordered their food and sat down, Xia Xuanyue said, “Guide City is a nice place, but it’s not easy to gain a foothold here.”</p>
<p>“It’s indeed not easy.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>“Have you ever thought of cooperating with anyone?” Xia Xuanyue asked.</p>
<p>“Not at the moment. However, if the Xia family wishes to invest in Guide City, we can consider it.” Zhou Wen looked at Xia Xuanyue and said, “I wonder how much the Xia family plans on investing?”</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue raised a finger without saying a word.</p>
<p>“What does one mean?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>“One secret for 30% of Guide City’s future profits,” Xia Xuanyue said.</p>
<p>“What kind of secret is so valuable?” Zhou Wen curled his lips. He didn’t believe that there was any secret that was worth 30% of Guide City’s profits.</p>
<p>“You haven’t found a dimensional zone to build a city yet, right?” Xia Xuanyue asked without answering.</p>
<p>“No.” Zhou Wen looked at Xia Xuanyue in surprise. Her question was definitely not without reason.</p>
<p>“I know of a dimensional zone nearby. It’s easy to defend and difficult to attack. Not only is it difficult for outsiders to enter, but the environment inside is also very suitable for building a city. It’s not a lot to exchange such a dimensional zone for 30% of your income, right?” Xia Xuanyue said.</p>
<p>“Since it’s a nearby dimensional zone, I’ll be able to find it sooner or later. Why should I give you 30%?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“If it was that easy to find it, I wouldn’t be telling you about it. If you don’t believe me, you can search for it. Forget anything I said if you can find it.” Xia Xuanyue seemed very certain that Zhou Wen wouldn’t find it.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll search for it first. We’ll talk when I can’t find it.” Zhou Wen was very direct.</p>
<p>“Take your time. I won’t raise prices even if you can’t find it.” Xia Xuanyue smiled.</p>
<p>“If I find it, I’ll definitely leave the best spot for your Xia family in the most prosperous place when I build the city in the future,” Zhou Wen added.</p>
<p>“Then it’s a deal.” Xia Xuanyue didn’t believe that Zhou Wen could find the dimensional zone. If it was that easy to find it, it wouldn’t have been hidden until today.</p>
<p>The reason the Xia family could find the dimensional zone was that it had something to do with the Xia family..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1573'>Chapter 1573: First Showcase of Human Sovereign Sacrifices to the Heavens</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>After Zhou Wen returned, he recounted the matter to Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Is there such a dimensional zone nearby?” Li Xuan had recently spent quite a bit of time studying the nearby dimensional zones.</p>
<p>Safety was ultimately a huge problem when it came to constructing a city outside. The city needed to be built inside a dimensional zone, but Li Xuan had inspected many nearby dimensional zones, but none of them satisfied him.</p>
<p>Or rather, he had nothing to choose from. The nearby dimensional zones were strange, making them unsuitable for building a city inside.</p>
<p>“Let’s continue searching. If we really can’t find it, we will have to negotiate with the Xia family. We need a dimensional zone.” Zhou Wen also knew that having so many people living outside wasn’t a long-term solution.</p>
<p>If a Calamity creature were to pass by one day, their city would be doomed. It was impossible for Zhou Wen to guard this place daily.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll continue searching. It doesn’t make sense that they can find it, but we can’t,” Li Xuan said gloomily.</p>
<p>After handing the matter of finding the dimensional zone to Li Xuan, Zhou Wen returned and continued studying how to kill the Starlord at the third level.</p>
<p>After returning, Zhou Wen searched for information on the Internet and learned that the third star of the Big Dipper was named Phecda. The Starlord guarding it was named Cherished Kismet.</p>
<p>“You have to repay what you owe. You have to pay for what you damaged. You have to pay for what you kill. I cherish kismet and I’ll make the call on how it should be returned. In this case, how can there be anything unfair in this world?”</p>
<p>This was the core belief of Starlord Cherished Kismet. After Zhou Wen saw this, he roughly knew why Starlord Cherished Kismet had such an ability.</p>
<p>How do I crack Starlord Cherished Kismet’s ability? Zhou Wen kept thinking about this problem.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried all the methods he could, but the outcome was the same. As long as he injured Starlord Cherished Kismet, he would be injured. He died if he killed him. There were no exceptions.</p>
<p>Wait! Zhou Wen suddenly thought of something as his eyes lit up.</p>
<p>He had been thinking about how to kill Starlord Cherished Kismet, but after reading some information on him, Zhou Wen realized that killing him didn’t necessarily require the power that killed.</p>
<p>These words sounded a little awkward, but they seemed to be a viable path.</p>
<p>I have to repay what I owe, damage or kill. Then, what if it’s something I give to him? Zhou Wen wanted to give killing Starlord Cherished Kismet from another angle a shot.</p>
<p>At this moment, Human Sovereign’s strength came in handy. This power couldn’t injure others, but it could treat the opponent.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wondered what the outcome would be if he used Human Sovereign’s power to deal with Starlord Cherished Kismet.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but take out his phone and open the dungeon before entering the Big Dipper dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Starlord Ravenous Wolf and Starlord Titan Gate hadn’t respawned. They probably wouldn’t respawn until all seven levels were cleared.</p>
<p>Such a serial dungeon is just too troublesome. I can’t even farm a dimensional creature alone. Zhou Wen entered the Phecda Star Palace without summoning a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>It was useless even if he summoned one. Even someone as powerful as the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General would die instantly if he made any killing attempts.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously thought about what would happen if Li Xuan were to kill Starlord Cherished Kismet.</p>
<p>Li Xuan would be beheaded when he slayed Starlord Cherished Kismet. However, being beheaded wasn’t enough to kill Li Xuan. Would this form some cycle? It was rather intriguing.</p>
<p>The green-armored Starlord Cherished Kismet remained sitting there firmly like a meditating Buddha. It was as though he didn’t see the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen engraved the Ancient Sovereign Sutra on the Wheel of Destiny. Human Sovereign’s figure appeared and fused with Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was like the sun as he emitted a glorious glow like a miniature humanoid sun.</p>
<p>“This domain’s name really sucks.” Zhou Wen activated Human Sovereign’s Sacrifices to the Heavens domain and muttered to himself.</p>
<p>The moment Human Sovereign Sacrifices to the Heavens was activated, large amounts of vitality surged to wherever the light from Zhou Wen’s body shone.</p>
<p>If there were injured people, their wounds would quickly heal in such a powerful vibrant domain. It could even revive people who were on the brink of death.</p>
<p>Even the injuries a Companion Beast suffered could rapidly recover.</p>
<p>Even if there wasn’t any damage, vegetation would rapidly grow. The effects of Human Sovereign’s Sacrifices to the Heavens when used to save people were excellent.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had never thought of using it to kill. This was the first time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared at Starlord Cherished Kismet as the power of Human Sovereign’s Sacrifices to the Heavens shone on him. Starlord Cherished Kismet suddenly opened his eyes.</p>
<p>After the green armor was hit by the light from Zhou Wen’s body, it began turning from green to yellow before turning from yellow to black as though it was rotting.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Wen, he didn’t suffer any injuries. Instead, he felt his vitality grow stronger.</p>
<p>It’s indeed feasible! Zhou Wen was overjoyed.</p>
<p>As for Starlord Cherished Kismet, he suddenly stood up and charged at Zhou Wen with all his might.</p>
<p>His Speed and Strength weren’t inferior to Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s, but to Zhou Wen, what was terrifying wasn’t his Strength and Speed. In terms of combat, Zhou Wen could barely fight him with his experience and techniques.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Starlord Cherished Kismet’s technique was much weaker than Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s. Starlord Ravenous Wolf was an all-rounder, while Starlord Cherished Kismet was clearly much weaker in this aspect. That allowed Zhou Wen to put up a fight.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen constantly used instant transmission and movement techniques to dodge Starlord Cherished Kismet’s attacks.</p>
<p>Starlord Cherished Kismet was illuminated by the light from Zhou Wen’s body. He was rapidly weakening and losing strength.</p>
<p>Finally, Zhou Wen had the chance to punch Starlord Cherished Kismet’s back. This punch contained intense vitality. If it struck a heavily injured person, the wounds on the heavily injured person would immediately heal.</p>
<p>However, when this punch landed on Starlord Cherished Kismet, his green crystal armor produced a black fist mark. The fist mark quickly turned to dust like burning ashes.</p>
<p>And in Zhou Wen’s body, large amounts of vitality appeared out of thin air, making his Human Sovereign Sacrifices to the Heavens domain even stronger.</p>
<p>I never expected that my Ancient Sovereign Sutra would have such a day. Zhou Wen was very excited as he threw punch after punch at Starlord Cherished Kismet at an even faster speed.</p>
<p>Starlord Cherished Kismet’s body was already very weak, and his speed was much slower. The green crystal armor had basically turned black, and the spots that Zhou Wen’s fist struck immediately turned to dust.</p>
<p>Under Zhou Wen’s onslaught, Starlord Cherished Kismet’s body exploded and turned to dust.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>A few dimensional crystals dropped. Just as Zhou Wen was feeling depressed about not having a Companion Egg drop, he realized that there was a Samsara Stone in the dimensional crystals that dropped.</p>
<p>Another Samsara Stone! Zhou Wen was delighted.. Ignoring everything else, he decided to pick it up first.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1574'>Chapter 1574: Megrez Star Palace</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Although the fusion system allowed Companion Beasts to advance to a higher level, there were too many uncertain factors involved. The failure rate was too high, and it might change some important characteristics of a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>After all, not all Companion Beasts had Jinxes Master, so it was fine for him to occasionally try his luck or experiment with large numbers of Companion Beasts of the same type.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare randomly fuse rare Companion Beasts. If he was unlucky, he would be flabbergasted if they were destroyed.</p>
<p>The Samsara Stone was different. Companion Beasts that used the Samsara Stone not only had an Evolvable attribute, but they could also be renurtured. Their evolution direction was easily controlled, allowing him to forge the Companion Beast he wanted.</p>
<p>Who should I use this Samsara Stone on? Zhou Wen was hesitant. It wasn’t that he didn’t have a choice, but he had too many choices. Many Companion Beasts needed to evolve.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen finally chose to give the Samsara Stone to the Invisibility Cloak.</p>
<p>The Invisibility Cloak had been very useful at the Mythical stage previously, but after reaching a higher level, Terror-grade creatures typically had extrasensory abilities. It was very difficult for the Invisibility Cloak to evade their detection.</p>
<p>If the Invisibility Cloak can advance to the Terror grade or even the Calamity grade, the invisibility it brings can resolve many problems, Zhou Wen thought as he placed the Invisibility Cloak and Samsara Stone together.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg could be used to withstand attacks head-on, but there was ultimately a limit. Furthermore, it was easy to be trapped. If the Invisibility Cloak could prevent the Calamity-grade creatures from detecting him, Zhou Wen could secretly explore the high-level dimensional zones without risking his life.</p>
<p>In reality, the Invisibility Cloak was a divine artifact that could save his life.</p>
<p>The Invisibility Cloak didn’t change at all after the flash of light. There weren’t any changes due to its original invisibility. However, its stats had returned to the Mortal stage and it had an Evolvable attribute.</p>
<p>How does upgrading the Invisibility Cloak work? Zhou Wen tried using Essence Energy Crystals which turned out useful. Soon, a high-level Essence Energy Crystal was absorbed by the Invisibility Cloak.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Invisibility Cloak’s level rapidly increased, jumping from the Mortal stage to the Epic stage.</p>
<p>Essence Energy Crystals can raise the level of the Invisibility Cloak. That makes things easier. Zhou Wen was overjoyed.</p>
<p>A problem that could be resolved with Essence Energy Crystals wasn’t a problem for Zhou Wen. This was likely the easiest Companion Beast to evolve.</p>
<p>It was really difficult for him to evolve creatures like Banana Fairy and Evil Spirit King.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen placed the Essence Energy Crystal that Starlord Cherished Kismet had dropped on the Invisibility Cloak. Essence Energy immediately surged over the Invisibility Cloak, and soon, the Invisibility Cloak rose to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>No way. A Calamity-grade Essence Energy Crystal only raised it to the Mythical stage? Zhou Wen felt his heart ache.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen didn’t need to grind Essence Energy Crystals. He could just get beaten up with the Chaos Egg up to produce many solid Essence Energy Crystals.</p>
<p>Since I’m already here, I’ll take a look at the fourth Star Palace. After all, I need to find a place to get beaten up. It doesn’t matter where I go. Zhou Wen wanted to know what kind of dimensional creatures there were in the subsequent Star Palaces.</p>
<p>After feeding the dimensional crystals to the Companion Beasts that required them, he used the teleportation nexus to enter the next Star Palace.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had checked the web for information on the Big Dipper. The fourth star was called Megrez. The Starlord that corresponded to it was likely the most familiar Starlord to those in the East District.</p>
<p>People treated those who received the title of top scholar as a mortal incarnation of Starlord Merciful Song, a testimony of how cultured this Starlord was.</p>
<p>For example, famous historical figures in the East District—Bao Qingtian, Wen Tianxiang, Liu Bowen, and so on—were said to be mortal incarnations of Starlord Merciful Song.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know the authenticity of these claims, but how could there be books for someone to study in a place like Megrez? It was most likely a legend without merit.</p>
<p>After a moment of dizziness, Zhou Wen arrived in front of the Star Palace on Megrez.</p>
<p>This is Megrez? Zhou Wen looked around in surprise.</p>
<p>As the Big Dipper consisted of stars with extremely high temperatures, ordinary humans would vaporize upon entering.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t hot at all. Zhou Wen even found it refreshing as though a cold wind was blowing from Megrez Star Palace.</p>
<p>Looking up, there was still the boiling high-temperature liquid outside the barrier. It was not much different from the first three stars, but the color of the liquid was somewhat different.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could tell that the liquid’s temperature was extremely high and extremely unstable. From time to time, he could see terrifying energy eruptions.</p>
<p>However, standing here, he still couldn’t feel any heat.</p>
<p>It should be a problem with the Star Palace, right? Zhou Wen carefully sized up the Star Palace. It looked like it was carved from white jade. Its various exquisite shapes and patterns were extremely elegant.</p>
<p>After carefully taking in his surroundings, Zhou Wen immediately realized that there was indeed a cold aura emitted from the jade palace.</p>
<p>A scholar is indeed different. He knows how to enjoy himself by using natural cold jade to build an air-conditioned room, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen pushed open the door of Megrez Star Palace with the Chaos Egg protecting him.</p>
<p>There were many mysterious words engraved on the walls of the Star Palace. Even the pillars had words. They had their own style, but unfortunately, Zhou Wen didn’t recognize any of them.</p>
<p>Starlord Merciful Song, don’t you descend to Earth often as a mortal? Can’t you at least learn the Federation’s common language? Or the East District’s ancient language? Your scribbles look good, but what’s the point of them if they can’t be understood? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>The legendary Starlord Merciful Song sat on a throne in the Star Palace.</p>
<p>He was wearing snow-white jade armor, but the armor was as smooth as a mirror. There weren’t even any patterns, much less words.</p>
<p>That’s a little overboard. You are Starlord Merciful Song after all. Even if you don’t have a word on your helmet, you should at least have one on your chest. Learn from Kakarrot. Just as Zhou Wen was thinking, he saw Starlord Merciful Song move.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed. His foot hadn’t even crossed the door’s sill when Starlord Merciful Song moved. This was unprecedented among the Starlords.</p>
<p>Starlord Merciful Song raised his right hand. In his right hand was a book.</p>
<p>The book was also made of jade and had a warm luster. Starlord Merciful Song looked up at Zhou Wen before slowly opening the jade book in his hand.</p>
<p>Why are you flipping through the book? Don’t tell me you want to test me on my knowledge? I’ve already returned most of the things I learned in school to the tutors. Unless you want to test me on questions from my third year in primary school, I wouldn’t know how to do it either.. Just as Zhou Wen was thinking, the jade book opened and a treasure glow surged into the sky.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1575'>Chapter 1575: Jiuyang Comes Knocking</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen imagined that the Chaos Egg would be capable of withstanding the treasure beam when it landed on the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat dumbfounded the next second. The treasure beam didn’t attack the Chaos Egg. Instead, it carried the Chaos Egg towards the jade book and stored it inside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen struggled to get out to no avail. He was forcefully pulled into the book. Just as he was thinking about how to escape, he heard a thud as the book snapped to a close.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt his surroundings turn dead silent as though it was an endless dark void. He couldn’t see, hear, or sense anything.</p>
<p>He attempted to rush out, but there was nothing around him. No matter where he went, the outcome was the same. It was as though there was no end to the void.</p>
<p>This is definitely Starlord Merciful Song’s domain power. I wonder what domain this is. Why is it so odd? Zhou Wen knew that things were going south.</p>
<p>Although Starlord Merciful Song didn’t kill him, trapping him here forever was worse than killing him.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this was a game, so Zhou Wen could commit suicide again. In reality, it was basically no different from dying.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen couldn’t wait for Starlord Merciful Song to open the jade book. He knew the principle of striking first to gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>He had made it a habit in-game to identify the other party’s abilities before taking action. It was mainly to understand the abilities of dimensional creatures. Otherwise, even if he killed a dimensional creature, he wouldn’t even know what abilities it had.</p>
<p>He failed to come up with a way to escape after some extended thinking. Even if he released the Golden Wyrm Scissors, it could only fly randomly in the endless void. There was no way out.</p>
<p>Here, spatial powers didn’t seem to work as though they were locked. Zhou Wen was actually unable to use spatial teleportation or instant transmission. He had no choice but to commit suicide.</p>
<p>Dripping a drop of blood to revive, he was just about to enter the dungeon and gain the upper hand over Starlord Merciful Song by killing him with the Golden Wyrm Scissors and not giving him a chance to flip open the jade book when he suddenly heard his phone ring.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, someone’s looking for you.” It was Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Who?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“He’s wearing a cloak and a mask. It’s impossible to tell who he is. However, from his bearing, he shouldn’t be an ordinary person. Do you want to meet him? If not, I’ll defeat him and send him on his way,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Let me take a look first,” Zhou Wen said as he walked out and quickly arrived at the door.</p>
<p>“Where is he?” Zhou Wen saw Li Xuan drinking tea in the guardhouse.</p>
<p>“Over there.” Li Xuan curled his lips towards the left of the door.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked in that direction and saw a person standing under the shade of a tree. Indeed, just as Li Xuan had said, the person was tightly covered up. One couldn’t even tell if the person was male or female.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen recognized him at a glance and couldn’t help but be slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>Jiuyang, what’s this fellow doing here? Zhou Wen found it odd.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was wondering why Jiuyang was being so polite if he knew that he was Egg Sovereign and wanted to seek revenge.</p>
<p>However, if he wasn’t here to seek revenge, what else could Jiuyang be doing?</p>
<p>“Do you know him?” Li Xuan asked as he drank his tea.</p>
<p>“Jiuyang,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“Pfft!” Li Xuan spat out the tea he had just drunk. “Which Jiuyang? Saint Jiuyang?”</p>
<p>“Who else could it be? I’ll go see what he’s here for,” Zhou Wen said as he walked towards Jiuyang.</p>
<p>“Who are you? Why do you want to see me?” Zhou Wen came in front of Jiuyang and asked, feigning ignorance.</p>
<p>“You know who I am,” Jiuyang said calmly. “I came here to invite you to the Holy Land as a guest.”</p>
<p>“Although I don’t know who you are, I appreciate your kindness. It’s best if you return. A sanctified place like the Holy Land isn’t a place an ordinary person like me can go.” Zhou Wen rejected it without even thinking.</p>
<p>Holy God hated him to the core. It would be odd if something beneficial awaited him in the Holy Land.</p>
<p>“Alright, if you defeat me, you don’t have to go,” Jiuyang said bluntly.</p>
<p>In fact, Jiuyang’s main goal for coming here was to fight Zhou Wen. Whether Zhou Wen went to the Holy Land was a matter of Holy God’s concern. Jiuyang didn’t care, but he couldn’t disobey Holy God’s orders.</p>
<p>“Don’t joke around. How can I beat you?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“If you don’t know who I am, how do you know that you can’t beat me?” Jiuyang said calmly to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that he had been careless, but he didn’t need to worry about such matters. He said with a smile, “Saints from the Holy Land are each stronger than the last. No matter which one of them comes, a mortal like me isn’t their match.”</p>
<p>“It’s useless no matter what you say. Fight me or I’ll take you back through force. The outcome will be the same,” Jiuyang said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we do this? Go back for now. I’ll visit the Holy Land when I’m free. I really have something on now and can’t leave.” Although Zhou Wen was already at odds with the Holy Land, he wasn’t willing to fall out with it.</p>
<p>“Do you want to choose the venue or should I do the honors?” Jiuyang ignored what Zhou Wen said and continued speaking at his own pace.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw Jiuyang’s behavior, he knew that things wouldn’t end well today. Instead of letting Jiuyang fight him here and cause Guide City to suffer, he might as well choose a venue himself. At the very least, he wouldn’t harm his family and friends.</p>
<p>“Follow me,” Zhou Wen said as he vanished.</p>
<p>Ordinary people couldn’t even see Calamity-grade entities when they traveled at the speed of light.</p>
<p>Jiuyang didn’t say a word as he followed. He followed beside Zhou Wen at an unhurried pace. Clearly, he was much faster than Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Of course, this wasn’t Jiuyang’s speed, but the speed of the Sun God Guardian.</p>
<p>“You are indeed very strong, but you don’t have a Guardian. Did you use Spirit Casting or a Mythical Serum?” Jiuyang sized up Zhou Wen as his eyes gradually lit up.</p>
<p>“Would you believe me if I said that I didn’t use Spirit Casting or a Mythical Serum?” Zhou Wen said as he flew.</p>
<p>“No,” Jiuyang answered with certainty because he had never seen a human advance to the Mythical stage purely as a human, much less to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>“Then I can’t answer you.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he had already crossed the mountain range known as the spine of the world and continued heading west.</p>
<p>“Why are you running so far? There’s no one here,” Jiuyang said.</p>
<p>“It’s boring without anyone. I’ll take you to an interesting place. It’s more interesting to fight there..” Zhou Wen continued flying forward without looking back as he headed for the West District.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1576'>Chapter 1576: Sunset City</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>As one of the six families, the Cape family had been like the other five families in recent years. Compared to the era when the six families controlled the Federation, they appeared abnormally low-key.</p>
<p>Of course, such a low profile didn’t mean that the Cape family had really reached a point of no return. Instead, the six families were working hard to digest the resources brought about by the evolution of the world.</p>
<p>In the past, the six families relied on the Holy Land, but as Earth’s dimensionalization sped up, this served as an opportunity for them to obtain a large number of resources without relying on the Holy Land for resources like before.</p>
<p>This was also the main reason why the six families dared to attempt to escape the Holy Land’s control. Only with resources could they have the capital to resist.</p>
<p>In this rapidly changing era, the Cape family was the family that had changed the most.</p>
<p>The Cape family actively attempted anything—Companion Beasts, Guardians, Spirit Casting, Mythical Serums—that could make humans stronger.</p>
<p>This allowed the Cape family’s strength to constantly increase. The development of the dimensional zones surrounding them was also the highest among the various families.</p>
<p>Sunset City was the city that the Cape family had built in a dimensional zone in recent years.</p>
<p>It was dark in the dimensional zone due to the lack of natural light. Only the city was brightly lit, so it was also called City of Nightlights.</p>
<p>This dimensional zone was called the “Forbidden Zone of the Gods.” It was a dimensional zone that the Cape family had discovered and developed in recent years. The Forbidden Zone of the Gods was very strange. It was like a world that couldn’t be illuminated by divine light. There was no birth, aging, sickness, or death here, as though being here gave one eternal life.</p>
<p>Of course, this was referring to the natural way of life. People still died from being murdered.</p>
<p>After the Cape family discovered the characteristics of the Forbidden Land of the Gods, they established Sunset City here. The members of the Cape family gradually moved to live in Sunset City.</p>
<p>The faces of the humans living here seemed to be frozen. They looked the same as they did a few years ago. There were no signs of aging.</p>
<p>Only by leaving Sunset City would time continue to leave signs on them.</p>
<p>Who didn’t want to live forever? The Cape family used the magical powers of the Forbidden Land of the Gods to recruit many young geniuses. Their faction also grew stronger day by day.</p>
<p>It was only because they hadn’t completely developed the dimensional zones they controlled and didn’t have the energy to plunder resources from other places that it gave off the impression that the Cape family had become much more low-key in the past few years.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had long heard of the Cape family’s Sunset City and the Forbidden Land of the Gods. He had always wanted to visit, but he had been tied down by other matters and didn’t have the spare time.</p>
<p>The reason Zhou Wen wanted to come to Sunset City wasn’t because he wanted to cause trouble for the Cape family due to his grudge with them. He was eyeing the dimensional zone known as the Forbidden Land of the Gods.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had recently been studying which dimensional zones were compatible with his Essence Energy Art. He wanted to advance his Essence Energy Art to the Calamity grade as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Back when he saw some information about the Forbidden Land of the Gods, Zhou Wen felt that this place might be very compatible with his Dao Sutra or Godfiend Era.</p>
<p>There might be doubt since the Dao Sutra was an Essence Energy Art from the East District, so how could it be compatible with the Forbidden Land of the Gods?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t believe that it was a problem. He only looked at the characteristics and didn’t deliberately distinguish between the East and West District.</p>
<p>The Dao Sutra Zhou Wen cultivated took the Zero Taboo path. As for the Forbidden Land of the Gods, it also had the ability to ban nomological powers. Therefore, Zhou Wen felt that the two were somewhat similar and wanted to try his luck.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a special space like the Forbidden Land of the Gods seemed to have some compatibility with the spatial-type Godfiend Era.</p>
<p>Of course, these were all Zhou Wen’s guesses. He had never been to the Forbidden Land of the Gods and only felt that there was such a possibility. This was the perfect opportunity for him to visit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he didn’t have a good relationship with the Cape family. If he really fought Jiuyang and destroyed their territory, Zhou Wen wouldn’t feel the pinch.</p>
<p>If the Forbidden Land of the Gods was really compatible with his Essence Energy Art and could help him advance to the Calamity grade, it would inevitably destroy the Forbidden Land of the Gods. Zhou Wen wouldn’t be troubled by that or feel sorry for the Cape family.</p>
<p>“Stop. Entry to the area ahead is forbidden. Unauthorized people are not to enter.” A Guardian of the Cape family blocked Zhou Wen and Jiuyang’s path.</p>
<p>“Please inform the owner here that we wish to enter,” Zhou Wen said to the Guardian with a smile.</p>
<p>“Do you have an appointment?” the Guardian asked as he sized up Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was wearing casual clothes and had a child-Demonic Neonate-in his arms. He looked completely different from when he entered the rankings. The Guardian clearly didn’t recognize him.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? Don’t you see the Saint here. What appointment do we need?” Zhou Wen pointed at Jiuyang.</p>
<p>“So what if it’s a Saint? This is the Cape family. Without an appointment, even the Holy Father can’t enter, much less a Saint.” The Guardian was very unyielding.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally wasn’t angry. He said to Jiuyang with a smile, “Your reputation doesn’t seem very useful!”</p>
<p>Jiuyang didn’t even look at Zhou Wen as though he wanted to ignore him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to push the matter of entering Sunset City to the Saint, but he couldn’t help but feel depressed when he saw Jiuyang remain silent.</p>
<p>A young man walked out and said to Zhou Wen, “Mr. Zhou, if you wish to enter Sunset City, you just need to give your name. There’s no need to do it in the name of the Saint.”</p>
<p>“You know me, but I don’t know you. Isn’t that a little unfair?” Zhou Wen sized up the young man.</p>
<p>The man was in his twenties and he didn’t look much older than Zhou Wen. He had blonde hair and blue eyes. He had a high nose bridge and a slender figure. Although he was nearly two meters tall, he didn’t look excessively tall due to his good proportions.</p>
<p>“My name is Carlos. Nice to meet you, Mr. Zhou.” The young man smiled and extended his palm.</p>
<p>“I don’t expect your Cape family to be happy seeing me.” Zhou Wen didn’t extend his hand as he looked at him.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if the Cape family will be happy seeing you, but I’m very happy to see you. You have always been my idol,” said Carlos with a serious expression.</p>
<p>“Are you sure I’m an idol? Not someone you want to beat up?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou, you’re reading too much into it. The grudge between you and the Cape family is one thing, but my admiration for you is another. Although I also want you dead, this doesn’t affect my admiration for your achievements. If possible, I hope you can help me sign an autograph. I’ll definitely treasure it,” said Carlos sincerely.</p>
<p>“There’s no need for an autograph. Let’s shake hands.” Zhou Wen extended his hand and shook Carlos’s hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen definitely didn’t dare randomly sign autographs.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1577'>Chapter 1577: Forbidden Land of the Gods</h3>
<h5>Translator: C alon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen imagined that Carlos wanted to take the opportunity to compete with him, but to his surprise, he only shook his hand.</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou, what brings you here to Sunset City?” asked Carlos. “Someone wants to fight. I heard that Sunset City is a good place, so I came to take a look,” Zhou Wen said. “Although our Cape family had a misunderstanding with you in the past, that’s all in the past. If Mr. Zhou has any displeasure with our Cape family, there’s no harm in saying it out loud. On behalf of the Cape family, I’ll definitely give you a satisfactory answer,” said Carlos calmly. “I’m not the one who wants to fight, but him. You should discuss it with him.” Zhou Wen pointed at Jiuyang</p>
<p>*This gentleman is…”Carlos sized up liuyang, but this person was covered up too well. He couldn’t tell who it was.</p>
<p>Jiuyang glanced at Zhou Wen. He naturally knew that Zhou Wen wanted him to be the scapegoat, but Juyang had no intention of defending himself.</p>
<p>“Jiuyang, lend me your Sunset City,” Jiuyang said indifferently.</p>
<p>Carlos was stunned when he heard Jiuyang’s name. There was probably no one in the Federation who didn’t know Jiuyang’s name.</p>
<p>Carlos looked at Zhou Wen in disbelief only to have him say: “In the flesh.”</p>
<p>“It’s my honor to have the two of you use Sunset City for a battle. However, I hope the two of you can give me some time. I’ll need to clean up Sunset City to make it more conducive for the two of you to fight in peace,” said Carlos pleasantly without flaring up.</p>
<p>“Sure,” Jiuyang said. Jiuyang and Zhou Wen knew that Carlos likely wanted to evacuate the people in the city to prevent them from being accidentally injured in their battle</p>
<p>Jiuyang was at the Calamity grade. If Zhou Wen could be his opponent, he definitely wouldn’t be too weak. A city could easily be destroyed in a battle at that level.</p>
<p>“In that case, I’ll take the two of you to Sunset City to take a look.” After giving instructions to someone, Carlos led Zhou Wen and Jiuyang into the Forbidden Land of the Gods.</p>
<p>Just as the legends said, the Forbidden Land of the Gods was pitch-black. Nothing could be seen. In the darkness, there was a road lined with street lamps that extended into the darkness like a glowing snake. At the end of the road was a brightly lit city. City of Nightlights appeared especially mysterious and beautiful in the darkness.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen walked into the darkness, he felt nomological forces restrain his body. The Heaven Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder immediately reacted. This was only a normal reaction Back at Mount Laojun, the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder would also react.</p>
<p>“Was this Sunset City later built? Zhou Wen was here to find an opportunity to advance to the Calamity grade. He wasn’t interested in a city built by humans.</p>
<p>“Yes, there are no buildings in the Forbidden Land of the Gods. It was just a dark and desolate area. There weren’t even dimensional creatures. Every blade of grass, tree, lamp, and brick here were transported in by our Cape family through painstaking efforts. Everything was constructed according to the design,” said Carlos.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was even less interested in Sunset City when he heard that. Therefore, he asked, “Could it be that there’s really nothing in the huge Forbidden Land of the Gods?”</p>
<p>“Not really.” Carlos thought for a moment and said, “There’s indeed a city in this darkness, but that city is only left with dilapidated walls. It should have been destroyed in a war. We’ve also studied that city, but we didn’t find any traces of creatures, nor did we find any fragments of daily necessities. It seemed to be an empty city.”</p>
<p>“Interesting. Take us there.” Zhou Wen was intrigued.</p>
<p>“This way, please.” Carlos had a good temper. He led the way with a flashlight and circled around Sunset City before heading deep into the darkness.</p>
<p>Along the way, Zhou Wen observed the Forbidden Land of the Gods. The ground here was barren like wasteland. There were traces of a battle everywhere</p>
<p>The various ring-shaped pits were similar to the ring-shaped craters on the moon. However, it was obvious that the ring-shaped pits here weren’t formed from meteorites, but from a specific impact.</p>
<p>There were also some crisscrossing rifts that looked like huge saber marks no matter how one looked at them. Apart from the darkness, the other laws here were somewhat chaotic. For example, when sound passed through an empty space, there would be a distortion. Clearly, there was a distortion or fault layer in the space.</p>
<p>Darkness wasn’t a problem for Zhou Wen, but the distortion of space and sound affected Truth Listener’s ability.</p>
<p>As Carlos walked, he explained, “Legend has it that the gods once fought here and destroyed everything, including order and light. This prevented all things from growing and eventually turned it into a forbidden land for life.” “Since this is a forbidden land where nothing can live, why is it said that one can live forever here?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“It’s just fake news. You can indeed not age here, but that’s only because your face doesn’t age. In fact, your body will still age. No matter how young you look, you will still die when you reach a high age,” said Carlos</p>
<p>“I see. However, even if one doesn’t age visibly, it’s already amazing. There should be many beautiful women who are willing to live in Sunset City for the rest of their lives, right?” Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised. If Sunset City could really gave people eternal life, the Cape family probably wouldn’t be able to occupy this place so safely.</p>
<p>“There are indeed many beautiful ladies who have come to Sunset City to settle down permanently. If Mr. Zhou is interested, you can take a walk in Sunset City. It’s considered a beautiful scene that’s rare elsewhere,” said Carlos with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen declined to comment. Jiuyang didn’t say a word. Clearly, he wasn’t interested</p>
<p>Carlos told him some more things about the Forbidden Land of the Gods as though he knew everything there was to know. It was impossible to find fault with him. Even as an enemy, it wouldn’t be nice to fall out with him.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen saw the ruins of an ancient city in front of him. However, there were only some broken walls and stone pillars left. Thanks to the years, these man-made objects had almost returned to their original states.</p>
<p>On the broken walls and stone pillars, there were no human text carvings or patterns. They were all in their most primitive state.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept using Truth Listener and his eyes to observe his surroundings, but unfortunately, he didn’t discover anything special in the ruins.</p>
<p>He didn’t find the tiny palm symbol, much less anything that could advance him to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>“Let’s do it here,” Jiuyang said to Zhou Wen impatiently.</p>
<p>“Alright. Since this is where the gods once fought, it’s a good place for a duel.” Zhou Wen said with a nod.</p>
<p>“Do you want to entrust the child in your hands to them?” said Carlos as he glanced at Demonic Neonate in Zhou Wen’s arms.</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou, if there’s a need, you can leave her with us. Our Cape family won’t do anything to the child,” said Carlos.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. It’s just for fun. I’ll carry her myself.” Zhou Wen didn’t really plan on fighting Jiuyang to the death.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1578'>Chapter 1578: Zone Core</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“Many people in Sunset City are ordinary people. I hope the two of you can</p>
<p>understand. Try your best not to implicate the innocent,” said Carlos.</p>
<p>This place was sufficiently far from Sunset City and the rules of the Forbidden</p>
<p>Land of the Gods were somewhat special, making it difficult for energy to be</p>
<p>transmitted over great distances; therefore, the possibility of Sunset City being</p>
<p>affected wasn’t high.</p>
<p>However, as a precaution, Carlos raised the issue.</p>
<p>“I think it’s best if you evacuate everyone,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Alright. Please wait a moment. Give me an hour.” Without wasting any time,</p>
<p>Carlos turned around and quickly returned to Sunset City.</p>
<p>Many core members of the Cape family in Sunset City were waiting for his</p>
<p>news in the meeting room.</p>
<p>Carlos, is that person really Jiuyang? Why is he here?”</p>
<p>“Are they really going to duel here?</p>
<p>“why did you order everyone to evacuate the Forbidden Land of the Gods?</p>
<p>After they stopped asking, Carlos slowly said, “They are going to have a duel in</p>
<p>the ancient city ruins. As a precaution, everyone has to temporarily leave the</p>
<p>Forbidden Land of the Gods.”</p>
<p>Everyone heaved a sigh of relief when they heard that.</p>
<p>“The abandoned city is far from our Sunset City. Furthermore, with the rules of</p>
<p>the Forbidden Land of the Gods, it’s impossible for shockwaves from the battle</p>
<p>to reach us. There’s no need to move, right?”</p>
<p>“There are more than a hundred thousand people in Sunset City. Evacuating</p>
<p>them isn’t that simple. Besides, no matter how strong Jiuyang is, ir’s</p>
<p>impossible for him to really massacre the city, right?”</p>
<p>“How strange. If it’s really Jiuyang, why would he fight Zhou Wen? Although</p>
<p>Zhou Wen is very strong, he shouldn’t have reached Jiuyang’s level, right?</p>
<p>Everyone discussed spiritedly, but most people didn’t change their opinions.</p>
<p>“Who has the final say here” Carlos asked expressionlessly.</p>
<p>Of course it’s you, but.” An elder from the Cape family wanted to say</p>
<p>something.</p>
<p>“Since you know that I call the shots, execute it. In an hour, everyone has to</p>
<p>leave Sunset City and the Forbidden Land of the Gods. If anyone has any</p>
<p>objections, you can report me to the family head in the future. Carry out my</p>
<p>orders immediately,” said Carlos coldly.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at each other. Although many people were unhappy, they</p>
<p>knew that it was useless to say anything else. This place was under Carlos’s</p>
<p>jurisdiction.</p>
<p>“This is making a mountain out of a molehill. We will definitely let the family</p>
<p>head hear about this.” The elder snorted coldly and got up to leave the meeting</p>
<p>room.</p>
<p>The others left one by one and began the evacuation.</p>
<p>Carlos got his subordinates to supervise the evacuation. After everyone had</p>
<p>left, a middle-aged man named Youkai came to Carlos and said, “Carlos, is</p>
<p>there really such a need? The abandoned city is very far from Sunset City. Even</p>
<p>a Calamity-grade battle shouldn’t affect this place. Furthermore, we forcefully</p>
<p>evacuated everyone because of this. This will affect our family’s reputation.”</p>
<p>Carlos shook his head and said with a bitter smile, “Although the chances aren’t</p>
<p>high, I can’t risk the lives of everyone in the city. Besides, it’s not like you don’t</p>
<p>know the grudge between Zhou Wen and our Cape family. He might very well</p>
<p>take the opportunity to seek revenge. Furthermore, I have a nagging feeling</p>
<p>that his trip here isn’t as simple as a duel. Why would he fight Jiuyang? Why did</p>
<p>he have to come to the Forbidden Land of the Gods to carry out the duel? There</p>
<p>must be a reason for this. Therefore, we can only watch him and prepare for</p>
<p>the worst.”</p>
<p>“Is Zhou Wen that strong” Youkai pondered.</p>
<p>“Do you think a Saint like Jiuyang will duel with anyone?” Carlos asked.</p>
<p>“That’s true. Ill go take a look as well.” It made sense when Youkai thought</p>
<p>about it. Although Jiuyang had lost to Egg Sovereign, everyone knew his</p>
<p>strength. How could such a person casually fight a weakling?</p>
<p>For Jiuyang to fight Zhou Wen meant that Zhou Wen was likely an existence on</p>
<p>the same level as Jiuyang. At the very least, he wasn’t much weaker.</p>
<p>Do you think it’s possible that Zhou Wen is Egg Sovereign?” Carlos suddenly</p>
<p>said.</p>
<p>“It’s really possible. Let’s go take a look.” Youkaï’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>After Carlos returned, Zhou Wen walked straight into the ruins, hoping to find</p>
<p>something new.</p>
<p>“What are you looking for?” Jiuyang suddenly asked as he followed Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t easy for me to make this trip. I want to take a look. Perhaps I’ll gain</p>
<p>something,” Zhou Wen answered casually.</p>
<p>If you wish to find the Zone Core here, I’m afraid you will be disappointed. The</p>
<p>Forbidden Land of the Gods doesn’t have a Zone Core,” said Jiuyang.</p>
<p>“What’s a Zone Core!” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he roughly</p>
<p>guessed what Jiuyang was referring to.</p>
<p>“How did you advance to the Calamity grade without knowing what a Zone</p>
<p>Core is?” Jiuyang paused and didn’t wait for Zhou Wen to answer. He explained,</p>
<p>“A Zone Core is the core of a zone. To advance to the Calamity grade, you need</p>
<p>to find the Zone Core corresponding to your Essence EnerEy Art. Only by</p>
<p>absorbing the Zone Core can you advance to the Calamity grade. Typical</p>
<p>dimensional zones only have one core. If the core is destroyed, the dimensional</p>
<p>zone will be useless. This is also the reason why the various Calamity creatures</p>
<p>on Earth will destroy the dimensional zone they were born in.”</p>
<p>Then how do you know that there’s no Zone Core here? Zhou Wen never</p>
<p>expected to hear this. If he had known this would happen, he wouldn’t have</p>
<p>taken so many detours.</p>
<p>“Zone Cores have their good and bad. The stronger a dimensional zone is, the</p>
<p>higher the quality of the Zone Core. After advancing to the Calamity grade, the</p>
<p>level of the Calamity Zone is directly related to the Zone Core. Typically, a Zone</p>
<p>Core is the same level as the Calamity grade. It’s divided into the levels of</p>
<p>Human Realm, Hell, and Heaven. If one absorbs a Human Realm Zone Core,</p>
<p>then after advancing to the Calamity grade, the Zone Core might very well stay</p>
<p>at the Human Realm forever. It’s almost impossible to improve further.”</p>
<p>After slightly adjusting his breathing rhythm, Jiuyang continued, “In the</p>
<p>Mythical era, the Forbidden Land of the Gods once had a Heaven-level Zone</p>
<p>Core. The so-called Battle of the Gods was actually just a contest for the Zone</p>
<p>Core here. Unfortunately, the Zone Core was ultimately destroyed. No one took</p>
<p>it away. Therefore, the Forbidden Land of the Gods is actually equivalent to</p>
<p>half a crippled dimensional zone.”</p>
<p>There’s actually such a thing? Who were the ones vying for the Zone Core back</p>
<p>then? How do I know what level the Zone Core is? Zhou Wen muttered</p>
<p>inwardly.</p>
<p>He had no idea that there was a division of levels when it came to Zone Cores.</p>
<p>He didn’t know any of this infomation when absorbing Zone Core. He felt that</p>
<p>just being able to fuse with his Essence Energy Art was sufficient, so he didn’t</p>
<p>think too much about it</p>
<p>lf the Ancient Sovereigm Sutra, i Refinement At, and Chaos Egg only</p>
<p>absorbed Zone Cores at the Human Realm, wouldn’t that mean that there’s no</p>
<p>way to improve further?Zhou Wen was somewhat worried.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1579'>Chapter 1579: Beauty of Simplicity</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“Haven’t you already advanced to the Calamity grade? Why are you still</p>
<p>searching for the Zone Core?” Jiuyang had seen Zhou Wen’s speed before. It was</p>
<p>definitely at the Calamity grade, so he was convinced that Zhou Wen had</p>
<p>already advanced to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t answer, nor could he answer. He could be considered a</p>
<p>Calamity-grade, but that was under the condition of simulating other Essence</p>
<p>Energy Arts. He himself hadn’t advanced to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>“You haven’t told me how to distinguish the level of a Zone Core?” Zhou Wen</p>
<p>asked.</p>
<p>“The Zone Core isn’t an inanimate object. Levels are demarcated artificially. To</p>
<p>know what level the Zone Core is, one can only observe the zone itself. The</p>
<p>stronger a dimensional zone is, the stronger the Zone Core condensed. There</p>
<p>are also some other details that need to be observed by yourself. There are no</p>
<p>fixed standards,” Jiuyang said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, Sweetie’s Hut is definitely very strong, but can</p>
<p>those words be considered a Zone Core? The Ancient Sword Tomb should be</p>
<p>very strong as well. The possibility of it being at the Heaven Realm is very high,</p>
<p>but I can’t be sure. Sovereign Sui’s Tomb can only be considered special. It’s</p>
<p>hard to say if it’s at the Heaven level.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been figuring things out by himself all this while. Today, he</p>
<p>finally learned more formal information. It only gave him more questions.</p>
<p>“Why are you telling me this?” Zhou Wen asked Jiuyang. He was considered an</p>
<p>enemy of the Holy Land, so there was no need for Jiuyang to tell him this.</p>
<p>Jiuyang said indifferently, “These things are considered secrets among</p>
<p>humans, but they aren’t considered secrets in the Holy Land. Anyway, you will</p>
<p>enter the Holy Land soon, so it’s fine to tell you this in advance.”</p>
<p>It’s good to be confident, but you have to be prepared to suffer a setback. Zhou</p>
<p>Wen felt that Jiuyang’s temper was very odd.</p>
<p>The two of them were clearly enemies. Furthermore, Zhou Wen had previously</p>
<p>defeated him in Dubhe Palace. They were about to have a duel.</p>
<p>However, Jiuyang could speak to him calmly. If it wasn’t for the impending</p>
<p>duel, Zhou Wen even felt like he was chatting with a friend instead of an</p>
<p>enemy.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen didn’t realize that he was also such a strange person. To</p>
<p>Jiuyang, Zhou Wen was also an enemy.</p>
<p>“It’s about time. There’s no need to wait any longer. Let’s begin. Summon your</p>
<p>Companion Beasts and let me see what else you have other than that</p>
<p>Companion Beast,” Jiuyang said to Zhou Wen as he glanced in the direction of</p>
<p>Sunset City.</p>
<p>“It’s just a duel. There’s no need to fight to the death. Why don’t we set some</p>
<p>ground rules?” Zhou Wen didn’t wish to fight Jiuyang to the death.</p>
<p>“What rules?” Jiuyang asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“Me using a Companion Beast or you using a Guardian isn’t the true</p>
<p>manifestation of our abilities. Neither of us will use external forces and we’ll</p>
<p>limit our strength at the Epic stage. How about we rely on our cultivation and</p>
<p>techniques to determine victory?” Zhou Wen had seen Jiuyang’s technique and</p>
<p>knew that his technique and realm were top-notch. He just lacked strength.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Jiuyang looked at Zhou Wen seriously before agreeing.</p>
<p>Just then, Youkai and Carlos returned and heard their conversation. Youkai was</p>
<p>enlightened and said, “It’s no wonder Zhou Wen dares to fight Jiuyang. So</p>
<p>that’s what he’s up to.”</p>
<p>However, Carlos shook his head and said, “Don’t think of it so simply. Although</p>
<p>their strengths are at the Epic stage, Jiuyang has already experienced the</p>
<p>strength of the Calamity grade. By having different vantage points, Jiuyang will</p>
<p>see everything from a more comprehensive perspective. His realm is also</p>
<p>much higher than Zhou Wen’s. It won’t be easy for Zhou Wen to win.”</p>
<p>“That’s true. Even if the same amount of money is given to different people, it</p>
<p>will definitely be the people with more information sources who can earn more</p>
<p>money.” Youkai thought of the industry he was familiar with.</p>
<p>As the two of them were discussing, they didn’t see a figure standing in the</p>
<p>darkness not far from them. As the environment was too dark and the figure</p>
<p>had no aura, he was like a ghost. No one noticed his arrival.</p>
<p>This person was naturally Godsfall, who had been secretly monitoring Jiuyang.</p>
<p>He had heard Zhou Wen’s conversation.</p>
<p>Jiuyang is too stubborn. It doesn’t matter if you call him stupid or clumsy, but</p>
<p>when it comes to persistence, I’m afraid there’s no one else in the world who</p>
<p>can compare to him. He has been cultivating martial techniques since he was</p>
<p>young. Among us Saints, any Saint was better than Jiuyang in the first year. In</p>
<p>the second year, Jiuyang could already keep up with everyone’s progress. And</p>
<p>in the third year, very few Saints of the same generation were his match when</p>
<p>it came to the same martial technique. They could only use other techniques to</p>
<p>make up for it and think of ways to defeat him. After a few years, even if</p>
<p>Jiuyang only uses the most ordinary martial techniques, it will be very difficult</p>
<p>for anyone to defeat him in terms of martial techniques.</p>
<p>Godsfall thought to himself, If Zhou Wen wants to compete with Jiuyangin</p>
<p>technique and realm, there’s no need for me to take action. What a pity.</p>
<p>“What weapon are you using?” Zhou Wen asked Jiuyang.</p>
<p>“My body is the weapon,” Jiuyang answered naturally, exuding full confidence.</p>
<p>“Then you won’t mind me using a saber, right?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Feel free to do so.” Jiuyang clearly didn’t mind.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his hand and the Bamboo Blade appeared in his hand.</p>
<p>However, after some thought, Zhou Wen put it away and summoned an Epic</p>
<p>Companion Beast saber.</p>
<p>Since he requested to have an Epic-stage battle, using the Bamboo Blade was</p>
<p>excessive.</p>
<p>“You can use the saber you are used to,” Jiuyang said.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter what saber I use. Since I was the one who came up with the</p>
<p>idea, you can attack first.” Zhou Wen held the hilt without unsheathing it.</p>
<p>Jiuyang didn’t stand on ceremony as he moved his feet and threw a punch at</p>
<p>Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Indeed, he had only used the strength of the Epic stage. Furthermore, this</p>
<p>punch didn’t look profound. It was just an ordinary thrust. It was fast enough,</p>
<p>but with the strength of the Epic stage, its speed was much slower than usual.</p>
<p>Ignoring Zhou Wen, even Youkai and Carlos could see it clearly. It wasn’t</p>
<p>difficult to dodge.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen only used his Epic strength, so the speed he could produce</p>
<p>wasn’t very fast. Faced with such a punch, he didn’t choose to dodge. Instead,</p>
<p>he raised his scabbard and blocked Jiuyang’s attack.</p>
<p>Jiuyang’s expression didn’t change despite having his punch being blocked. His</p>
<p>other fist followed as his punches rained down.</p>
<p>Jiuyang’s boxing technique wasn’t profound. Furthermore, he didn’t have Feng</p>
<p>Qiuyan’s ability to grow stronger while in combat. However, this ordinary</p>
<p>boxing technique pressured Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>In this world, the more complicated something was, the higher the level.</p>
<p>Sometimes, simplicity was also a form of beauty, a simple sublime feeling.</p>
<p>Jiuyangwas the kind of person who could turn something simple into</p>
<p>something sublime.</p>
<p>It was clearly a very simple boxing technique, but when used by Jiuyang, it</p>
<p>became extremely threatening.</p>
<p>The feeling was akin to Monkey Sun having 72 transformations; yet, it was</p>
<p>difficult for him to withstand the might of Buddha’s flip of the hand..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1580'>Chapter 1580: Who’s the One With the Higher Vantage Point?</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>It looks like Jiuyang is getting very serious! Godsfall knew very well that the simpler Jiuyang’s boxing technique was, the stronger it was.</p>
<p>Youkai clearly didn’t understand this principle. He had always felt that a true expert’s move would be totally impossible to guard against. It would definitely be an extremely incisive killing move. Every move would be fatal. Even if it wasn’t gorgeous, it would definitely be strange and unpredictable.</p>
<p>Youkai couldn’t tell what was good about Jiuyang’s simple and boring boxing technique. He said in puzzlement, “Is this a legendary Calamity-grade powerhouse? It doesn’t look like much. I can also use such a boxing technique. It seems like these Calamity-grade powerhouses are only slightly stronger.</p>
<p>Their realm might not be much higher than the average person.”</p>
<p>However, Carlos said with a sneer, “If you were to use such a fist technique to fight Zhou Wen, you would have long been killed.”</p>
<p>Youkai said indignantly, “I guarantee that my boxing technique will be identical to Jiuyang’s. So he’ll be fine, while I’ll be beaten to death by Zhou Wen?”</p>
<p>“You only saw his boxing technique, but you didn’t see the details,” Carlos replied.</p>
<p>“Details?” Youkai was slightly stunned.</p>
<p>“His boxing technique is very simple, so is his movement technique, and his footwork is equally simple. However, when he uses them together, it’s nothing simple. Far from that,” said Carlos.</p>
<p>“Why can’t I tell what’s so special about him? I can also use these things of his without any flaws.” Youkai carefully sized him up again, but he failed to identify anything.</p>
<p>Carlos didn’t look at Youkai, He stared at Jiuyang in battle and said, “You can’t tell because he has already reached the realm of becoming one with nature. It looks ordinary, but in fact, every move he makes, from his movement technique, footwork, fist techniques, to even the changes in his eyes have</p>
<p>perfectly fused with his surroundings. in a battle in such ruins, no brick or wall is an obstacle for him; instead, these external objects aid him. This can’t be summarized with the word simple. You only see his fist technique being simple, but you don’t see the multi-dimensional world he has built. You only</p>
<p>see the fist, but he has the entire world in his eyes.”</p>
<p>“Is it that unbelievable?” No matter how carefully Youkai looked at it, he only found Jiuyang’s battle very fluid. He didn’t see anything about the multi-dimensional world.</p>
<p>“Yes, Saint Jiuyang is really very strong. It’s not as simple as borrowing the Guardian’s strength. Even if he suppresses his strength to the Epic stage, Zhou Wen’s chances of defeating him are pitifully low,” said Carlos.</p>
<p>“Then what about you? Can you crack his multi-dimensional world?” Youkai asked. Clearly, in his heart, Carlos was an existence comparable to Jiuyang.</p>
<p>In fact, although Carlos wasn’t famous, he had been entrusted with important responsibilities by the Cape family at a young age. One could tell his status in the Cape family from how he ruled Sunset City.</p>
<p>Such a person was naturally not a fool.</p>
<p>“My Guardian isn’t as strong as his,” Carlos answered.</p>
<p>“Then, ignoring Guardians, what about the martial arts realm?” Youkai asked again.</p>
<p>“Twon’tt lose.” Although Carlos’ answer was somewhat ambiguous, he was confident that he wouldn’t lose against a figure like Jiuyang. It was obvious that he was very confident in his martial arts realm.</p>
<p>“I knew it. Saint Jiuyang, Ya of the Holy Spirit Association, and Immortal of the League of Guardians are definitely not your match. In the future, when you inherit the position of family head, our Cape family will definitely be able to recover its former glory,” Youkai said happily.</p>
<p>“How can it be that easy? There are too many powerful fellows in the Federation these days. I don’t have the confidence to beat those fellows you mentioned. Ignoring everything else, just fighting Jiuyang to the death would be my death.”</p>
<p>“That’s because your Guardian’s level isn’t as high as his. When the Guardian’s level is the same, he will definitely die,” said Youkai.</p>
<p>“That might not be the case. To be honest, even if our strength levels are the same, I’m not completely confident of defeating him. This person is like a Buddha. Mortals won’t be able to find any flaws in him. That’s why I said that I won’t lose, but I might not win either,” said Carlos seriously.</p>
<p>“Well, I have a question. You make Jiuyang sound so powerful. Why hasn’t he defeated Zhou Wen yet?” Youkai asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Carlos sighed and said, “Jiuyang is very strong, but Zhou Wen isn’t weak either. His standards aren’t much worse than Jiuyang’s. Furthermore, he keeps adopting a purely defensive stance. No matter how Jiuyang tries to entice him, he doesn’t counterattack. Under such circumstances, it’s very difficult for</p>
<p>him to make mistakes. He also doesn’t give Jiuyang a chance.”</p>
<p>“see. Now that you mention it, I understand. Just like in sieges of ancient cities, the defending side will have the advantage. The attacking side needs several times the military strength to storm the city. However, their strength is the same now. It will be very difficult for Jiuyang to win. Zhou Wen is good</p>
<p>at scheming,” Youkai said.</p>
<p>“That’s right. It’s just like soccer. When the weaker team fights the stronger team, they often choose to defend before counterattacking, This is the strategy Zhou Wen is using now,” said Carlos with a nod.</p>
<p>Godsfall, who was behind them, heard their conversation. He couldn’t help but size up Carlos in surprise as he thought to himself, I never expected such a figure to appear in the Cape family. Should I kill him first?</p>
<p>However, after some hesitation, Godsfall temporarily gave up on this thought. He had come mainly for Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts and didn’t wish to reveal his existence; that would make Zhou Wen wary.</p>
<p>Godsfall shared the same view as Carlos. Although Zhou Wen didn’t seem to be in a bad situation, just as Carlos had said, although weak teams could counterattack, strong teams might not give them a chance to counterattack.</p>
<p>It was especially so for a person like Jiuyang. He wouldn’t make any mistakes, much less give his opponent a chance. Therefore, Zhou Wen would definitely lose in the end.</p>
<p>The difference in realm is still too great. Zhou Wen doesn’t stand a chance. It won’t be too late for me to suddenly strike and snatch Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts when Jiuyang defeats him. Godsfall watched the battle with the intention of watching the show.</p>
<p>The saber in Zhou Wen’s hand constantly changed its angle and blocked Jiuyang’s repeated attacks. He just wanted to see how deep Jiuyang’s realm went.</p>
<p>This was the first time Zhou Wen had encountered an opponent like Jiuyang. He was very curious.</p>
<p>However, in terms of realm, Jiuyang’s realm was much weaker than the vine sword’s realm. In terms of vantage point, Zhou Wen had the high ground.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was somewhat interested in Jiuyang’s realm and wanted to make more observations.</p>
<p>Jiuyang’s realm was somewhat similar to the Nondisputatious Sword Intent of the three thousand sword intents. It seemed like he could draw on things as a reference to push the Nondisputatious Sword Intent to a higher level…</p>
<h3 id='chapter1581'>Chapter 1581: Nondisputatious Sword Intent</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere.</p>
<p>Those who are skilled do not dispute; the disputatious are not skilled in it.</p>
<p>Those who know are not extensively learned; the extensively learned do not know it.</p>
<p>The sage does not accumulate for himself. The more that he expends for others, the more does he possess of his own; the more that he gives to others, the more does he have himself.</p>
<p>With all the sharpness of the Way of Heaven, it injures not; with all the doing in the way of the sage he does not strive.</p>
<p>This was the origin of the Nondisputatious Sword Intent. It was a passage from ancient scriptures.</p>
<p>The skilled didn’t need to strive. Things would naturally fall into their hands because others couldn’t do what they could do. It would only be natural for the things to be given to them.</p>
<p>Jiuyang’s realm also contained this concept. He pursued his own cultivation without being affected by anything else.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Jiuyang’s realm and gained a deeper understanding of the Nondisputatious Sword Intent.</p>
<p>3000 sword intents are just too many. If I want to figure out the true meaning of all of them, forget a mortal like me with about a hundred years of lifespan, even if I could live for more than a thousand years and figure out one every year, that will only cover a third. Besides, it’s impossible for me to figure</p>
<p>out the true meaning of one sword intent in a year. I’s fine if I just figure out a few things in the fature, but I can’t pursue perfection like Jiuyang. The ancient scripture’s saying is right. Those who know are not extensively learned; the extensively learned do not know it. Although my 3,000 sword intents</p>
<p>aren’t weak, Jiuyang’s realm is much higher than any of the 3,000 sword intents, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>As the essence of their realms were too similar, Zhou Wen quickly made a huge breakthrough in the Nondisputatious Sword Intent from referencing Jiuyang.</p>
<p>Til give it a try and see how well I’ve cultivated this sword intent. Zhou Wen’s saber stance changed as he used a concept similar to Jiuyang’s. It was none other than the Nondisputatious Sword Intent that had just experienced a breakthrough.</p>
<p>Jiuyang,Carlos, and Shenluo’s eyes focused at the same time. They could tell that the change in Zhou Wen’s saber aura was very similar to Jiuyang’s boxing concept.</p>
<p>He actually wants to imitate Jiuyang’s technique and concept. Isn’t he a little too idealistic? How can such a realm be mastered in a short period of time? It’s especially so for Jiuyang’s characteristic of pursuing details. It’s not something that can be mastered just from mimicking. He’s aiming high only to</p>
<p>achieve little. Shenluo snorted coldly.</p>
<p>Carlos was also somewhat puzzled. Zhou Wen’s actions seemed a little too rash.</p>
<p>It was true that Zhou Wen was a genius, but Jiuyang was also a genius. Furthermore, he was a top genius. To use Jiuyang’s ultimate skill that he had cultivated for so many years after such a short period of time was a little arrogant.</p>
<p>However, the battle left the two dumbfounded.</p>
<p>‘The saber in Zhou Wen’s hand remained sheathed, but he had already switched from defense to offense. During the battle with Jiuyang, the similarity of their techniques and realms exceeded 90%.</p>
<p>More importantly, Zhou Wen had managed to tie with Jiuyang without being at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>“Could it be that… there’s really such a genius in this world…” Carlos widened his eyes and muttered to himself in disbelief.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” By the side, Youkai didn’t understand. He could only tell that Zhou Wen wasn’t blindly defending, but his attacks weren’t very powerful. They were very ordinary.</p>
<p>Carlos said with a bitter smile, “Youkai, do you think I’m considered a genius?”</p>
<p>“Of course. If you aren’t a genius, there aren’t any geniuses in the Federation. Although you don’t have the Sovereign Body inherited from your family, your talent and comprehension far exceed those fellows with the Sovereign Body. I still remember the time when you trained in an Essence Energy Skill</p>
<p>John took two months to master. You did it for a short while to be much stronger than him,” said Youkai.</p>
<p>“Then, do you think it’s possible for someone to learn something that will take me one to two decades in just a few minutes?”</p>
<p>“That’s naturally impossible. A human who can do such a thing, no—I shouldn’t say human; it’s impossible for humans to do it. If they can do it, they are not human at all,” said Youkai.</p>
<p>“But that fellow just did it,” said Carlos with another bitter smile.</p>
<p>“Who? What did he do?” Youkai was stunned and asked blankly.</p>
<p>“Jiuyang’s talent isn’t inferior to mine. I believe his cultivation realm was obtained through arduous cultivation. If it were me, I would also need so much time, but in the short twenty to thirty minutes of battle, Zhou Wen actually reached the same realm as him. He’s even on par with Jiuyang,” said Carlos.</p>
<p>“That’s impossible, right? Could it be that Zhou Wen already knew it and is only using it now?” Youkai guessed with a look of disbelief.</p>
<p>Carlos sighed and said, “I hope so too, but it’s obvious that his realm is still improving. He should still be in the midst of comprehension. In the past, I always felt that I was a genius, not inferior to anyone in the Federation. Even An Tianzuo was only a target for me to catch up with in my studies.</p>
<p>However, after meeting Zhou Wen today, I suddenly feel disheartened and even some despair.”</p>
<p>“Don’t think that way. There must be a reason. It’s impossible for there to be such a genius among humans. There must be a problem. We can find the problem. Don’t give up…” Youkai immediately panicked. Carlos was the most promising person in the Cape family now. If he were to be dispirited, it would</p>
<p>undoubtedly be a fatal blow to the Cape family.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’m not a greenhouse flower who hasn’t experienced storms. Even if Zhou Wen is really such a genius, I won’t give up on my goal. I’m just feeling wistful.”</p>
<p>“That’s good.” Youkai heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that there was nothing abnormal about the latter’s expression. However, he was still alarmed.</p>
<p>If it was really as Carlos had said, Zhou Wen was too terrifying.</p>
<p>Shenluo’s surprise was far greater than that of the two. They didn’t know much about Jiuyang, so they were only speculating.</p>
<p>However, Shenluo knew a lot about Jiuyang. Among the many Saints in the Sun God Holy Temple, only Jiuyang had obtained the recognition of the Sun God Guardian and obtained the Sun God Holy Temple’s Holy Artifact.</p>
<p>Although everyone was a Saint in name, Jiuyang, who controlled the Sun God Holy Temple’s Holy Artifact, was actually the Sun God Temple’s Holy Son.</p>
<p>Shenluo was in a similar situation. He knew very well how great the price one needed to pay to become the Holy Son who controlled the Holy Artifact.</p>
<p>Jiuyang had been cultivating arduously since he was young. His achievements were the result of years of hard work. Even Shenluo had to admit that he was no match for Jiuyang in terms of the martial arts realm.</p>
<p>It was very difficult to mimic Jiuyang’s realm because it wasn’t as simple as hard work. It also required inhuman talent.</p>
<p>Such a talented and extremely hardworking person had actually been imitated by someone in a short battle. Furthermore, the combat strength he displayed wasn’t inferior to Jiuyang’s. Shenluo found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>This Zhou Wen looks much more terrifying than expected. It’s no wonder Lord Holy God sent me to help Jiuyang. Indeed, Lord Holy God has foresight. I definitely can’t let such a fellow grow stronger. Otherwise, he will be a great enemy of my Holy Land. Killing intent flashed in Shenluo’s eyes..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1582'>Chapter 1582: Connate Appropriation</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>The Holy Land could tolerate a human with a powerful Companion Beast, but it couldn’t tolerate the existence of a person who was powerful enough to threaten the Holy Land.</p>
<p>Godsfall secretly rejoiced. Thankfully, Zhou Wen’s cultivation hasn’t reached an uncontrollable level. There’s still a chance of destroying him before he attains his full potential.</p>
<p>Godsfall was already secretly searching for a suitable opportunity to attack.</p>
<p>However, before killing Zhou Wen, Godsfall wanted to snatch his Companion Beast. From his point of view, there was no conflict between the two matters.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s main combat strength stemmed from his Companion Beast. As long as it was snatched from him, Zhou Wen would suffer a drop in strength. Killing him wouldn’t be difficult since it was useless having only a potent realm.</p>
<p>Godsfall no longer had the mood to watch the show. Instead, he stared intently at Zhou Wen, searching for the best opportunity to attack.</p>
<p>Now that Zhou Wen hadn’t summoned his Companion Beast and had suppressed his strength to the Epic stage, it could be said that this was the best opportunity for Godsfall. It was a god-sent opportunity.</p>
<p>Godsfall was the Connate Holy Temple’s Holy Son. The Essence Energy Art he cultivated was the same as Li Xuan’s Invincible Connate Divine Art.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan cultivated an incomplete version, and not only did Godsfall cultivate the complete version, but it was also a modified version that had been supplemented by past Saints.</p>
<p>Unlike Jiuyang, Godsfall didn’t choose to contract a Guardian. Instead, he chose the path of Spirit Casting and devoured the Connate Ancient God Guardian.</p>
<p>Coupled with the Connate Holy Temple sparing no expense to groom him, Godsfall had reached the Hell level like Jiuyang thanks to the massive amount of resources.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the abilities that Godsfall was good at were different from the typical Connate Holy Temple Saint. His Life Providence, Life Soul, Wheel of Destiny, Terror transformation, and Calamity Zone were different from Li Xuan’s.</p>
<p>Li Xuan became stronger from being beaten up, but Godsfall could directly plunder the growth of others. It could be said that the two of them were at two extremities with some similarities.</p>
<p>The Calamity Zone of Godsfall was called “Connate Return” and was also called “Connate Appropriation.”</p>
<p>In his domain, he could appropriate the other party of everything other than their Connate body.</p>
<p>A Connate Body referred to one’s body of flesh and blood. Clothes, weapons, and accessories could be appropriated as long as they were external.</p>
<p>Companion Beasts were also foreign objects. Godsfall could also appropriate them.</p>
<p>However, Connate Appropriation wasn’t without restrictions. If Godsfall wanted to strip something, he had to come into contact with it. Furthermore, it needed to be used on living creatures.</p>
<p>Of course, the appropriation of a Companion Beast had to be done when Zhou Wen was alive. Once Zhou Wen died, the Companion Beast would transform into Essence Energy and dissipate back into the universe. Then there would be nothing to appropriate.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, as long as the enemy summoned a Companion Beast, Godsfall could snatch it for his own use.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was somewhat powerful. Godsfall didn’t wish for Zhou Wen to have a chance to resist, so he decided to attack Zhou Wen himself.</p>
<p>As long as he touched the Companion Beast tattoo—even if it was invisible—he could successfully appropriate it.</p>
<p>Therefore, what Godsfall needed to do was actually determine where the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was located on Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>This wasn’t difficult to determine. There was a general rule. For example, armor-type Companion Beasts were usually tattooed on one’s chest or back.</p>
<p>Weapon-type Companion Beasts were typically on one’s palms or arms.</p>
<p>Godsfall didn’t know what the Tiger Soul General’s companion form was, but from the looks of it, it was highly likely that it was similar to armor. Even if it wasn’t, such a Companion Beast was most likely on the chest or back. These were also the targets Godsfall chose.</p>
<p>As long as I snatch his Tiger Soul General, it will be easy for Jiuyang and me to kill him, Godsfall had already made up his mind. He was just waiting for an opportunity to succeed in one strike.</p>
<p>In order to increase his success rate, Godsfall planned on touching Zhou Wen’s body as much as possible. It wouldn’t be a problem to appropriate more Companion Beasts. Regardless, he couldn’t miss the Tiger Soul General. Otherwise, it would be troublesome once Zhou Wen summoned it.</p>
<p>Godsfall didn’t know that even if Zhou Wen were to summon the Tiger Soul General, it wouldn’t be as powerful as he had seen on the Cube.</p>
<p>There was no heat here at all. The Tiger Soul General had no way of accumulating the demonic flames in his body, nor did he have the time to temper his body. His level was only at the Human Realm, so he was basically no threat to Godsfall and Jiuyang.</p>
<p>Godsfall didn’t know this, so he was determined to obtain the Tiger Soul General. Godsfall even wanted to use the Tiger Soul General to kill Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, oh Zhou Wen, blame it on yourself for becoming enemies with the Holy Land and and on your overestimation of your abilities. Godsfall took the opportunity to instantly appear behind Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Godsfall was good at the Connate Breath technique. In the senses of others, Godsfall was no different from a rock on the ground. If one didn’t see him with their own eyes, it would be difficult to discover his existence.</p>
<p>Despite being extremely careful, Zhou Wen failed to discover him.</p>
<p>At the instant Godsfall approached, he clung his entire body to Zhou Wen’s back. His hands wrapped around him and pressed down on Zhou Wen’s chest.</p>
<p>The Connate Appropriation took effect. The clothes covering the area vanished just before Godsfall touched Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s reaction was extremely fast. In an instant, the Chaos Egg had already burgeoned from his body and sent Godsfall flying.</p>
<p>Godsfall’s figure spun in midair and landed on the ground like a ghost. He licked his lips and stared smilingly at Zhou Wen with his slender eyes.</p>
<p>“Egg Sovereign! So Zhou Wen is Egg Sovereign!” Youkai shouted when he saw the Chaos Egg over Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>Carlos was first slightly taken aback and then enlightened before he said, “I see. It’s no wonder Jiuyang challenged Zhou Wen to a duel. I should have known.”</p>
<p>In fact, it couldn’t be blamed on Carlos. It was mainly because the Tiger Soul General’s performance was too domineering, No one believed that Zhou Wen could obtain its Companion Egg from killing the corresponding dimensional creature. Previously, the main speculation by people was that Egg,</p>
<p>Sovereign was Human Sovereign. They didn’t think of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Their guess wasn’t wrong, but no one expected Human Sovereign to be Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Inever expected the Holy Land to think highly of me. They even laid an ambush with a Saint here to wait for me,” Zhou Wen said with a frown. He had already vaguely sensed that something was amiss with his Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>“Godsfall, why are you here?” Jiuyang also frowned and asked Godsfall.</p>
<p>“To help you complete the mission,” Godsfall said indifferently.</p>
<p>“This is my business. I don’t need you,” Jiuyang said coldly.</p>
<p>“This is an order from Lord Holy God.” With that said, Godsfall ignored Jiuyang and looked at Zhou Wen with a smile. “Zhou Wen, it’s our first time meeting. My name is Godsfall, a Saint from the Connate Holy Temple. Don’t forget my name in what’s left of your short life..”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1583'>Chapter 1583: Snatching Companion Beasts</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“What did you do to me?” Zhou Wen asked as he checked his body.</p>
<p>He could clearly sense that there was something wrong with many of his Companion Beasts. There was a faint force that seemed to lock onto a portion of his Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>It was especially so for the Companion Beasts on his back. This feeling was extremely intense. A similar situation happened at his chest where Godsfall had touched.</p>
<p>Godsfall smiled at Zhou Wen and said, “What I did was to hold your life in my hand. Your life is now in my hands.”</p>
<p>“Ido want to know how I’ll die,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>“You mostly rely on your Companion Beasts, right?” As Godsfall spoke, he snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>With a snap, a hidden tattoo on Zhou Wen’s body automatically surfaced and flew out. Even the Chaos Egg failed to stop the Companion Beast from leaving.</p>
<p>Soon, a Poison Bat-like Companion Beast flew to Godsfall’s side and circled him twice before flying onto his back and turning into a tattoo.</p>
<p>“How can this be?” Carlos and Youkai were alarmed. They had never heard of anyone capable of snatching a person’s Companion Beast.</p>
<p>‘There was a powerful contractual force binding Companion Beasts. Once they hatched, they couldn’t even be transferred. If they were forcefully transferred, one had to pay a huge price or even pay with their lives.</p>
<p>Godsfall had actually snatched a Companion Beast from him. If this ability were to spread, it would probably cause panic in the Federation.</p>
<p>“Is that all?” Zhou Wen remained unmoved.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already seen similar powers from Liu Yun. Furthermore, Liu Yun’s technique was better than Godsfall’s.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had roughly guessed that Godsfall needed to touch his Companion Beast tattoo to steal it. As for Liu Yun’s Star Stealer, it had long reached the stage of stealing pets out of thin air.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had always wanted to learn Star Stealer, but he had never had it drop. This left him vexed.</p>
<p>“Is that all?” Godsfall’s expression turned cold as he raised his palms and clapped.</p>
<p>With a clap, another Companion Beast tattoo appeared on Zhou Wen’s body. This time, it wasn’t just one, but ten. All of them flew towards Godsfall.</p>
<p>Godsfall originally wanted to strike fear in Zhou Wen. Ordinary people would be horrified to have ten Companion Beasts stripped from him.</p>
<p>However, Godsfall soon realized that the ten Companion Beasts he had appropriated from Zhou Wen were all low-level Companion Beasts like Poison Bats, Runic Heavy-Armored Warriors, Steel Cauldron Sprites, and so on. He didn’t even get a single Mythical stage, much less Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>“Any more?” Zhou Wen asked Godsfall.</p>
<p>He had many low-level Companion Beasts on him. Ignoring the Musical Note Sprites, he needed a large number of Runic Heavy-Armored Warriors, Steel Cauldron Sprites, and other Companion Beasts for fusion. He would farm them every now and then, so he had a lot of them. Furthermore, these</p>
<p>Companion Beast tattoos were mainly on his chest and back.</p>
<p>Godsfall’s expression changed slightly. He never expected Zhou Wen to have so many low-level Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Although there were no restrictions on the number of Companion Beast contracts, having too many Companion Beasts was useless in battle. A person’s control was limited. It was not bad for an ordinary person to control two or three Companion Beasts while fighting.</p>
<p>It would be impressive even for some experts who cultivated psyche techniques to simultaneously control more than ten Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Unless it was an extremely intelligent Companion Beast, summoning a large number of Companion Beasts was similar to having a disorderly mob. They might even become a burden, much less be of help.</p>
<p>Therefore, most people would choose Companion Eggs that were useful to them or excellent Companion Eggs for incubation. Most of the Companion Eggs they didn’t need were sold.</p>
<p>It was especially so for a high-level powerhouse like Zhou Wen. He had no interest in Companion Eggs below the Mythical stage. Even if he picked them up, he would give them to his friends and juniors or exchange them for the materials he needed.</p>
<p>It was very rare to have low-level Companion Beasts like Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen didn’t need them for fusion, he wouldn’t have had so many low-level Companion Beasts on him.</p>
<p>“Let’s see how many low-level Companion Beasts you have,” Godsfall said coldly as he clapped his hands again.</p>
<p>Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!</p>
<p>Godsfall could only appropriate ten Companion Beasts for each Connate Appropriation. He could only sense that Connate Appropriation had locked onto Zhou Wen’s body, but he didn’t know how many Companion Beasts there were.</p>
<p>This was because no matter how many Companion Beasts there were, the tattoos would overlap. Furthermore, different Companion Beasts could appear in the same spot. Zhou Wen’s back and chest were densely covered with overlapping tattoos.</p>
<p>Godsfall could only sense the Companion Beast tattoos, but he didn’t know how many Companion Beasts there were or what Companion Beast they were.</p>
<p>His clapping wasn’t done at random, Every time he used Connate Appropriation, he expended a large amount of Essence Energy. Even if Godsfall had tremendous amounts of Essence Energy, this series of clapping made his forehead drip with sweat.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts flew out like scattering flowers. More than a hundred Companion Beasts flew towards Godsfall.</p>
<p>Youkai and Carlos were deeply shocked by this scene. To them, Godsfall’s Connate Appropriation was an invincible divine technique.</p>
<p>With such an ability, he was an existence that could do whatever he wanted among humans.</p>
<p>After all, most humans relied on their Companion Beasts to fight. Who wouldn’t be afraid of Godsfall’s ability?</p>
<p>“Twonder if he can snatch a Guardian. If he can do so, it will be too terrifying,” Youkai muttered to himself.</p>
<p>They were alarmed, but Godsfall was so depressed that he nearly blew a gasket.</p>
<p>Godsfall clearly saw the Companion Beasts before they flew over. Many of them were low-level Companion Beasts he had seen previously. Even if he had never seen them before, there were many that looked familiar. Clearly, they were commonly-seen, low-level Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Godsfall wasn’t sure if there were any higher-level Companion Beasts, but there was definitely no Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>“Continue.” Zhou Wen stood there without moving, nor did he have any intention of attacking Godsfall. He wanted to know how many Companion Beasts Godsfall’s ability could snatch from him—he wanted to know the limits of this ability.</p>
<p>As for whether his important Companion Beast would be snatched away, Zhou Wen wasn’t too worried.</p>
<p>He had too many Companion Beasts on him. It wasn’t easy for Godsfall to win the luck of the draw—Companion Beasts that Zhou Wen valued. Furthermore, there weren’t many Companion Beasts that Zhou Wen valued.</p>
<p>Prisoned Dragon was in that area, but the Limitless Demon Dragon King wasn’t. It was located slightly lower.</p>
<p>Tiger Soul General was also situated in that region, but Zhou Wen wasn’t worried about it at all. If Godsfall really snatched Tiger Soul General, Liu Yun’s experience back then would be what was awaiting him..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1584'>Chapter 1584: Holy Artifact</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Godsfall gritted his teeth and raised his hands to clap again. He refused to believe that Zhou Wen had all these trash Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!</p>
<p>After a series of clapping, Godsfall was covered in sweat. His eyes were red, and the veins on his forehead protruded.</p>
<p>‘The Companion Beasts on Zhou Wen’s body flew up like scattering petals of flowers in bloom and headed for Godsfall.</p>
<p>Carlos and Youkai were already stunned, but Zhou Wen was about to burst out laughing.</p>
<p>Godsfall’s luck was clearly not good. Among the Companion Beasts he snatched, there wasn’t even a Mythical Companion Beast, much less Prisoned Dragon. They were all Epic and Legendary Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn’t Godsfall’s bad luck. It could only be said to be expected.</p>
<p>After all, the combined ratio of Mythical and Terror-grade Companion Beasts was at most one in ten thousand. It wasn’t easy to get them from drawing one to two hundred Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Ignoring ten consecutive draws, there was no guarantee of a successful draw of a Mythical Companion Beast even with a hundred consecutive draws.</p>
<p>After the Companion Beasts landed on Godsfall, they belonged to him. Upon receiving the information from the Companion Beasts, Godsfall’s pupils dilated as blood seeped out of the comer of his mouth.</p>
<p>This fellow… How many trash Companion Beasts does he have on him… Godsfall already knew that none of the Companion Beasts he had snatched were at the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Wen didn’t know the answer to this question. He had farmed a large number of Companion Beasts for the sake of fusion. Although many low-level Companion Beasts were useless to others, their Life Providences, Life Souls, and skills might be good materials for fusion. Zhou Wen naturally</p>
<p>wouldn’t skip out on them. He had been constantly gathering Companion Beasts that were trash in the eyes of others.</p>
<p>Just the Companion Beasts on his back numbered in the tens of thousands. It would be difficult for Godsfall to extract the Tiger Soul General from them.</p>
<p>This was under the circumstances that Godsfall had made a relatively good choice. He hadn’t chosen the location of the Musical Note Sprites. Otherwise, if he tried drawing Companion Beasts from the hundreds of thousands of Musical Note Sprites, it would make Godsfall suffer a greater breakdown.</p>
<p>No… [can’t let this continue… That bastard is nuts… Why does he have so many trash Companion Beasts on him for no reason. From that detestable expression he’s wearing, he must still have many trash Companion Beasts. Godsfall also knew that he was at his Essence Energy limits. If he were to.</p>
<p>continue appropriating, he would collapse without Zhou Wen needing to do a thing.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, can only use the Connate Holy Temple’s Holy Artifact. Godsfall took a deep breath and suppressed the trembling he experienced due to his excessive Essence Energy expenditure.</p>
<p>‘The six Holy Temples each had a Holy Artifact. Only Saints chosen by the Holy Temples had the right to possess it.</p>
<p>Four Holy Temples had finished choosing the wielders of the Holy Artifacts: the Trajectory Holy Temple’s Xiao, the Sun God Holy Temple’s Jiuyang, and the Connate Holy Temple’s Godsfall.</p>
<p>The so-called Holy Artifacts were actually special items born from the combination of the Holy Temple’s dimensional powers and Earth’s powers.</p>
<p>The dimension’s powers were originally suppressed by the rules on Earth, making it difficult for them to show their true effects.</p>
<p>However, because it combined the powers of Earth itself, this suppression didn’t exist. However, only one such Holy Artifact was born in every temple. As it took a long time to produce one, it was impossible for a second one to be produced unless another period as long as the time between the last</p>
<p>Mythical era to the present happened.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it wasn’t as simple as production. Although a Holy Artifact was produced, it was only in its embryonic form. Its abilities were very limited.</p>
<p>As Earth constantly and rapidly evolved in recent years, the Holy Temple had extracted more power from Earth allowing it to truly take form.</p>
<p>‘The Connate Holy Temple’s Holy Artifact was called “Connate Insight.” It was a stone talisman that looked like a comma. On one side of the stone talisman was a long horizontal carving, and on the other side was a short horizontal carving.</p>
<p>The power of the Connate Insight was very mysterious, as though it had the ability to predict the future. However, this ability needed external help to trigger it, but not by any external power.</p>
<p>Even among Saints who cultivated the Invincible Connate Divine Art, there weren’t many people who could activate the Connate Insight. Only Godsfall could truly use it.</p>
<p>Godsfall extended his palm and the ancient stone talisman floated above it. As his Essence Energy Art circulated, it surged into the stone talisman.</p>
<p>The two vertical marks on both sides of the stone talisman emitted a strange light. As for the stone talisman itself, it gradually spun. Soon, the speed at which it spun made it impossible to see its original appearance.</p>
<p>The stone talisman in Godsfall’s hand looked like a constantly spinning and changing Taiji sphere that emitted an infinite mysterious aura.</p>
<p>“Godsfall, put away your Holy Artifact. Zhou Wen is my target. I can finish him myself,” Jiuyang said with a frown.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll leave him to you, but I want his Tiger Soul General.” Godsfall’s sleeves fluttered as the light from Connate Insight grew stronger. It made Godsfall’s face appear strange.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was originally alarmed as he wondered if he should retreat.</p>
<p>However, after hearing what Godsfall said, he felt relieved and dispelled the thought of retreating. He stared at the Holy Artifact in Godsfall’s hand that was changing like a Taiji sphere, wanting to know what use it had.</p>
<p>In the future, he would have to fight the Holy Land, so it was better to learn more about it now.</p>
<p>With the Chaos Egg protecting him, Zhou Wen didn’t panic.</p>
<p>As the power of the Connate Insight became stronger, Godsfall’s entire body seemed to be affected by it. The Connate aura circulated between the man and the talisman, causing Godsfall to undergo a complete transformation.</p>
<p>Godsfall was like an ancient god. His eyes seemed to have six illusory, intersecting lines. They were like lightning as he stared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt uncomfortable as though he was being peeped at with his clothes stripped off. In the next second, Godsfall suddenly shouted, “It’s him!”</p>
<p>As Godsfall shouted, he extended his right thumb and middle finger and snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>Pa!</p>
<p>Although he was still using Connate Appropriation, the snap of his fingers was like a bolt from the blue. There was even a bolt of lightning that lit up between his fingers, illuminating the entire Forbidden Land of the Gods.</p>
<p>After the thunderclap sounded, Zhou Wen felt his body relax as though a thousand tonnes of weight had been lifted off his body. A Companion Beast was forcefully separated from him, transforming into a mecha general that rode a ferocious tiger. It ran towards Godsfall in midair. It was none other than</p>
<p>the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched in surprise as the Tiger Soul General flew towards Godsfall. He was alarmed. He actually managed to snatch the Tiger Soul General from me. That Holy Artifact is interesting!</p>
<p>‘The Tiger Soul General wasn’t a Companion Beast that could be easily snatched away. Zhou Wen couldn’t shake it off even if he wanted to, so it was even harder for others to snatch it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen still remembered that the last time Eldest Senior Brother Liu Yun managed to snatch the Tiger Soul General was when he used the Zhang family’s ancestral Fate Reversal Talisman. Furthermore, the Tiger Soul General’s level was relatively low back then.</p>
<p>Now that the Tiger Soul General could still be snatched away despite being at the Calamity grade, this piqued Zhou Wen’s interest in the stone talisman.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1585'>Chapter 1585: Tiger Soul General Appropriated</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>‘When Godsfall saw Tiger Soul General fly towards him, he revealed a gratified smile and thought to himself, Although the process was a little tricky, I still completed the mission.</p>
<p>After Tiger Soul General landed on Godsfall, Godsfall looked down at Zhou Wen and said indifferently, “You should be proud to be able to force me to use the Holy Artifact.”</p>
<p>However, when Godsfall sensed the information from Tiger Soul General, he was stunned. He almost couldn’t believe the information he had received.</p>
<p>“Impossible. How can it only be at the Human Realm?” At that instant, Godsfall thought that he had snatched a fake Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>From Tiger Soul General’s performance on Dubhe, he was undoubtedly at the Hell level. Furthermore, he had to be a top existence at the Hell level. Only then could he possess such might and easily kill two Starlord Ravenous Wolves.</p>
<p>Therefore, Godsfall found it unbelievable that Tiger Soul General was only at the Human Realm.</p>
<p>However, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s name wasn’t wrong and its appearance was right. It couldn’t be fake. After all, Calamity-grade Companion Beasts were relatively rare. Zhou Wen couldn’t have two identical Calamity-grade Companion Beasts, right? The chances were too low.</p>
<p>Could it be that Tiger Soul General is really that strong? He can kill Hell-level creatures at the Human Realm? Godsfall had his suspicions.</p>
<p>Apart from the difference in physical attributes, there was also the evolutionary difference of the Calamity Zone. A Hell-level domain would undergo a qualitative change.</p>
<p>For example, the two domains of fire and water that were both at the Human Realm might be able to mutually restrain each other, but if one domain advanced to the Hell level, it would completely crush the other.</p>
<p>Godsfall only noticed Tiger Soul General’s level and ability, but he didn’t have the time to carefully study his skills. Therefore, he didn’t realize how terrifying the Jinxes Master skill was.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, is this the Tiger Soul General you used to kill the Starlord Ravenous Wolves?” Godsfall summoned Tiger Soul General and asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Although he felt that the possibility of Zhou Wen possessing two Tiger Soul Generals wasn’t high, Godsfall still wanted to get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>“It’s whatever you make it to be.” Zhou Wen looked at Godsfall with a look of pity.</p>
<p>It was fine if he possessed Tiger Soul General, but to actually summon it—even Liu Yun hadn’t been as arrogant as him.</p>
<p>“I’s best you answer my question. Otherwise, even if you still have Tiger Soul General, only death awaits you. With the Holy Artifact, I already have the power of the Heaven level. I’m already an invincible existence in the human world.” Godsfall held the Connate Insight in his hand as his body emitted a</p>
<p>resplendent divine light that nearly illuminated the pitch-blacke Forbidden Land of the Gods.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned as he looked at Godsfall. He could sense that Godsfall wasn’t bragging.</p>
<p>‘The strength of his aura had indeed exceeded the Hell-level creatures Zhou Wen had seen. It was highly likely that he had reached the Heaven level.</p>
<p>“What’s this so-called Holy Artifact? It actually has such a terrifying effect.” Zhou Wen had greater interest in the Connate Insight in Godsfall’s hand.</p>
<p>Although the Heaven level was very strong, Zhou Wen had the Chaos Egg, It shouldn’t be a problem for him to stay alive for the time being, so he didn’t have to be afraid.</p>
<p>“You think you have what it takes to deem yourself invincible in the human world?” As Zhou Wen spoke, he stared at Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>He found it odd. Why wasn’t Godsfall suffering from bad luck? Liu Yun had suffered tremendously the moment he stole Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>Could it be that Godsfall is like me and doesn’t fear Jinxes Master? Or could it be that Jinxes Master is useless after being augmented by that Holy Artifact? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>“Jiuyang, you heard it too. He’s the one who’s tempting fate. Don’t blame me for not leaving him to you.” As Godsfall spoke, the Connate aura on his body became even more terrifying. The Connate Insight entered a state of flux. Like a miracle, it emitted Connate Divine Light.</p>
<p>The entire Forbidden Land of the Gods was illuminated by divine light. The light over at Sunset City paled in comparison as though it was daytime everywhere.</p>
<p>Godsfall was about to walk towards Zhou Wen when he suddenly heard a strange sound, as though something had shattered.</p>
<p>Then, he saw specks of starlight appear in the Forbidden Land of the Gods.</p>
<p>The dilapidated city bricks, the cracked ground, the broken stone pillars, the barren desert, and the shattered ground were filled with specks of light.</p>
<p>Just like fireflies, they flew out from all directions and floated towards the sky. It was like a snowstorm that arose from underground. Countless snowflake-like points of light drilled out from the ground and flew up in the opposite direction. The scene was extremely strange, but it was also extremely</p>
<p>spectacular.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Godsfall looked at the snowflake-like points of light and was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Godsfall. Everyone was alarmed and puzzled, unsure what the snowflakes that suddenly appeared were.</p>
<p>It’s coming… It’s coming… Zhou Wen was somewhat excited.</p>
<p>In fact, he didn’t know what the snowflake-like points of light were. However, he had a nagging feeling that the sudden appearance of these snowflakes was related to Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>The points of light constantly condensed in the sky as they snowballed. Although no one knew what it was, the terrifying energy fluctuations in the snowball left everyone alarmed.</p>
<p>“Stop gaslightin;</p>
<p>” Godsfall held the Connate Insight in his hand and transformed into a Connate Divine Light that struck the huge snowball in the sky.</p>
<p>The Connate Divine Light was indomitable and could destroy virtually anything in the world. However, when it struck the snowball, it was like water being soaked up by a sponge as it seeped into the snowball.</p>
<p>The snowball that was originally emitting light became even brighter. As for the snowflakes that flew out of everything, they flew towards the snowball at an even faster speed and fused with it.</p>
<p>The points of light that seemed to be snow appeared to have accelerators activated as they charged towards the huge snowball in the sky.</p>
<p>Godsfall was first taken aback before he realized the problem.</p>
<p>These snowflake-like points of light weren’t caused by anyone. They seemed to have appeared because of his Connate power and the Connate Insight.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally saw this scene. His thoughts were the same as Godsfall. The points of light were definitely affected by the Holy Artifact.</p>
<p>However, he went one level deeper than Godsfall. He felt that this coincidence might not be a pure coincidence. Perhaps it was thanks to Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully sensed the energy fluctuations of the points of light, hoping to know what kind of power it was.</p>
<p>However, the energy fluctuations of the points of light were very special. He could only sense the existence of energy, but he couldn’t tell what attributes it had.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his finger and touched a point of light with his fingertip. Immediately, he felt a strange force enter his body from his fingertip.</p>
<p>This power… Zhou Wen widened his eyes in disbelief..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1586'>Chapter 1586: Terrifying Jinxes Master</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen became alarmed when he felt the power in the point of light.</p>
<p>This power was actually attracted by the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. It flew towards the Heaven-Opening Scripture engraving on the Wheel of Destiny and landed in it, disappearing with a flash.</p>
<p>Could these things… be parts of the shattered Zone Core of the Forbidden Land of the Gods? Zhou Wen’s expression changed as he looked at the points of light.</p>
<p>More and more points of light flew towards the snowball in the sky at an accelerated pace. In just a moment, countless points of light gathered together, forming a huge cloud-like blob of light in the sky.</p>
<p>Godsfall used Connate Insight, but he failed to dissipate the light blob with one strike. Instead, he boosted the power of the light blob. He immediately knew that this thing was likely triggered by his strength.</p>
<p>After some thought, Godsfall gathered his strength and charged at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Regardless of what the blob of light was, all he needed to do was kill Zhou Wen and leave the Forbidden Land of the Gods before that thing fully formed.</p>
<p>He held the Connate Insight in one hand and grabbed at Zhou Wen with the other. Zhou Wen immediately felt an immense suction force suck the Chaos Egg towards his palm.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was considering how to deal with it, his eyes suddenly lit up.</p>
<p>Light shone brightly in the sky as a beam of light suddenly shot down from the ball of light. Like lightning, it struck Godsfall’s head.</p>
<p>Godsfall was alarmed, but he couldn’t dodge the lightning, All he could do was gather his strength to resist it.</p>
<p>Lightning struck Godsfall’s head, but it didn’t produce any sparks or electric bolts. Godsfall’s body trembled as his legs went limp and he fell to the ground.</p>
<p>‘The Connate aura on his body instantly vanished without a trace, resulting in the Connate Insight losing its driving force and dimming. It stopped spinning and turned back into the stone talisman before falling to the ground.</p>
<p>As for the blob of light in the sky, it became even more dazzling as it smote down with lightning.</p>
<p>Godsfall’s expression changed drastically as he hurriedly gathered his strength again. However, he had none left. He wanted to dodge, but it was too late. All he could do was summon a bird-shaped Companion Beast to shield his head.</p>
<p>The lightning seemed to have a life of its own as it circled around and struck Godsfall.</p>
<p>Godsfall had been drained of his Connate Essence Energy. The lightning landed on him and vanished like previously, but the change in Godsfall’s body wasn’t as simple as the disappearance of Essence Energy.</p>
<p>Godsfall, who was originally rather handsome, instantly had his hair tun white, his face covered in wrinkles and his eyes turbid. His vitality dropped to rock bottom, like an old man on the brink of death.</p>
<p>Everyone was alarmed when they saw this scene. Even someone as powerful as Godsfall had ended up in such a state after being struck by two bolts of lightning. It was shocking.</p>
<p>Youkai and Carlos turned around and ran. Who knew if the blob of light would treat them as its next target after killing Godsfall.</p>
<p>Even Godsfall couldn’t withstand two bolts of lightning. They probably couldn’t even withstand a single strike.</p>
<p>“Jiuyang… Save me…” The aging Godsfall was like an old man. It was difficult for him to even struggle to his feet. He used all his strength to cry to Jiuyang for help, but he only let out an extremely weak and hoarse voice.</p>
<p>‘When the third bolt of lightning struck down, Jiuyang’s body emitted light as he condensed the Sun God Light and smote the lightning that descended from the sky.</p>
<p>The lightning seemed bent on hitting Godsfall. Before it collided with the Sun God Light, it strangely vanished. When Jiuyang saw it again, the lightning had landed on Godsfall.</p>
<p>“Ah!” As the third bolt of lightning descended, Godsfall let out a tragic cry. The flesh on his body shriveled at a discernible pace.</p>
<p>A layer of withered skin clung tightly to the bones, almost no different from a skeleton.</p>
<p>However, Godsfall didn’t die just like that. His eyes protruded due to the shrinking of his flesh. They were filled with horror and despair.</p>
<p>With his current body, it was difficult for him to even crawl up. Alll that was left was death.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed when he saw this. After all, he was at the Hell level, and comparable to a Heaven-level powerhouse with the use of the Connate Insight. Yet, he still ended up in such a state.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t feel any pity for him, but when he thought of Godsfall’s outcome and how he might have been harmed by Jinxes Master, he felt uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Tiger Soul General had always followed him in the past. Furthermore, he had an even more ferocious Bamboo Blade resulting in double the Jinxes Master. He was lucky that nothing had happened to him.</p>
<p>In the past, he only felt that Jinxes Master had some influence like resulting in him getting hurt, but it wouldn’t lead to his death.</p>
<p>However, to see Godsfall reduced to such a state left Zhou Wen’s heart trembling as his legs went limp. It was a first.</p>
<p>Although it’s quite a pity, it can’t be considered a bad thing if Tiger Soul General dies with Godsfall, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>He originally wondered if he should find an opportunity to retrieve Tiger Soul General, but after seeing Godsfall’s death, Zhou Wen felt that he should cherish his life and stay away from Jinxes Master.</p>
<p>After losing the Human Realm Tiger Soul General, he could still obtain other Companion Beasts. If for some reason he failed to hold back Jinxes Master one day, it wouldn’t be as simple as losing a Companion Beast. His life would be over.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already considering whether he should throw the Bamboo Blade out. This was too terrifying, He didn’t wish to become like Godsfall.</p>
<p>Now wasn’t the time to think about this. Zhou Wen and Carlos reacted the same way. They turned around and prepared to run, Who knew if that thing would treat them as its next target after killing Godsfall?</p>
<p>Godsfall had Tiger Soul General, and he had the Bamboo Blade. They were both lethal things.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to run, he heard a boom. An explosion sounded from the blob of light as another bolt of lightning struck down.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that the lightning was aimed at Godsfall to kill him, but to his surprise, the lightning didn’t strike at Godsfall. Instead, it came at him.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t! Zhou Wen was so frightened that he immediately instant transmitted, hoping to dodge the lightning.</p>
<p>However, it was useless. The bolt of lightning struck him amidst his instant transmission, blasting him back into reality.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was blasted out in an instant. No matter how strong his previous opponent was, they could at most strike him down before he instant transmitted or after he completed it. He had never encountered such a situation.</p>
<p>Godsfall, who was on his last breath, seemed to feel a little more delighted when he saw Zhou Wen being struck by the lightning.</p>
<p>“Come to hell with me.” Godsfall gritted his teeth, his hoarse voice almost inaudible..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1587'>Chapter 1587: Condensing a Zone Again</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen felt his heart palpitate. All he could do was pin his hopes on the Chaos Egg, hoping that it could withstand the power of the lightning.</p>
<p>However, in an instant, Zhou Wen felt a chill run down his spine. The power of the lightning seeped into the Chaos Egg and struck him.</p>
<p>Even the activated Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and Truth Listener were useless.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shivered as the Chaos Egg automatically dissipated, exposing his body.</p>
<p>It’s over! Zhou Wen’s body and mind trembled as he felt his calves and stomach cramp. He was only human, one that was afraid of death. In particular, he didn’t want to end up like Godsfall.</p>
<p>He wanted to resist, but he realized that his Essence Energy was instantly sucked away by the lightning that invaded his body.</p>
<p>His Essence Energy was like iron powder, and the lightning was like a magnet. The former was instantly sucked dry, leaving nothing behind.</p>
<p>Without Essence Energy, Zhou Wen couldn’t do anything, He couldn’t even throw Demonic Neonate out.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen finally knew how Godsfall felt when he was struck. It was no wonder Godsfall didn’t have a chance to resist. Zhou Wen didn’t have a chance either.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could sense that the lightning retreated like the receding tide after absorbing his Essence Energy.</p>
<p>However, before it left Zhou Wen’s body, the Heaven-Opening Scripture on his Wheel of Destiny automatically lit up without any Essence Energy to support it.</p>
<p>The lightning that was retreating at high speeds stopped. It moved toward the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder as though it had been attracted.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised. Although he had previously discovered that the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder could attract the points of light, he felt that it might not be able to withstand such terrifying energy after seeing Godsfall’s outcome.</p>
<p>Lightning surged into the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and the sutra automatically opened. Strange words gradually appeared on the blank pages.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t recognize any of the words, but for some reason, he vaguely understood the meaning behind them.</p>
<p>Godsfall lay on the ground as he panted with great difficulty. However, he stared intently at Zhou Wen, unwilling to take his last breath as though he was waiting for Zhou Wen to head to the netherworld with him.</p>
<p>Jiuyang looked at Zhou Wen who had been struck by lightning, After some thought, he reached out and took out something. It was a strange bead that resembled a miniature sun.</p>
<p>With the divine bead in hand, the Sun God Light on Jiuyang’s body became stronger and stronger. He stared at Zhou Wen as though he wanted to do something.</p>
<p>Another bolt of lightning descended as Jiuyang’s body emitted a divine light. It illuminated the nearby area, revealing everything. The powerful Sun God Light struck the lightning.</p>
<p>“Jiuyang… What are you doing… Cough…” Godsfall shouted hysterically with all his strength, only to cough out blood.</p>
<p>“He’s my opponent. Even if he dies, he has to die at my hands,” Jiuyang answered calmly.</p>
<p>However, just as he said that, Jiuyang’s expression changed drastically. The Sun God Light augmented by the Holy Artifact failed to stop the lightning.</p>
<p>The lightning vanished like a ghost. When it appeared again, it had already struck Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, Godsfall laughed crazily. His face was as warped as a devil’s.</p>
<p>However, Godsfall’s smile quickly froze.</p>
<p>‘When he had been struck by the second lightning bolt, his body had rapidly aged and lost its vitality. However, none of that happened after Zhou Wen was struck by the second lightning bolt.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s aura didn’t weaken; it even became stronger. It was as though an intangible force was erupting from his body.</p>
<p>Jiuyang was slightly taken aback as he stopped and looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Rumble!</p>
<p>Explosive booms sounded from the light blob in the sky as the bolts of lightning formed a thunderstorm that constantly struck Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen seemed to be bathed in lightning, but his body didn’t wither like Godsfall. Instead, his aura became stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>“Impossible… Impossible…” Godsfall widened his eyes as though he had gone mad. He cried out angrily, but his voice was so hoarse that it was difficult to hear.</p>
<p>Words constantly appeared on the Heaven-Opening Scripture in Zhou Wen’s body. Every bolt of lightning that fused into it formed words on the Heaven-Opening Scripture.</p>
<p>The shapes of the words were strange, but one could understand their meaning with a glance.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, that thing is indeed the Zone Core that was shattered back then. Furthermore, it happens to be compatible with my Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. It has benefited me. Instantly, Zhou Wen felt mixed emotions.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if this was considered luck. Although he had previously discovered that the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder could absorb the points of light, he wouldn’t have had the chance to absorb it if Godsfall hadn’t attracted the shattered Zone Core out.</p>
<p>I wonder what the Zone Core looked like before it was shattered? Zhou Wen stared at the blob of light in the sky and realized that it was gradually shrinking.</p>
<p>The blob of light was clearly not the true face of the Zone Core. It was only a collection of fragments. There was no Inowing what the real Zone Core looked like.</p>
<p>Unless one chanced upon an ancient powerhouse who had participated in the battle, it was very difficult to know what the core looked like.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was actually somewhat puzzled. This Zone Core was already so terrifying in its shattered state. It could easily kill the Holy Artifact-wielding Godsfall; how powerful would it be when it was complete?</p>
<p>This Zone Core was clearly extraordinary to have so many powerhouses vie for it.</p>
<p>‘More and more words appeared on the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. Finally, it began condensing a domain power. Zhou Wen could sense that the power of the Heaven-Opening Scripture was building a nomological domain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body floated in the air as a strange force spread out from his body.</p>
<p>These were the original ancient city ruins. Nearby, the ancient city ruins within the domain’s range were undergoing a strange change.</p>
<p>The broken walls, stone pillars, and ground were like a movie playing backwards as they were restored to their former appearance.</p>
<p>‘The weathered bricks were gradually repaired, and broken stone pillars appeared out of thin air. The entire ancient city seemed to be undergoing a reversal of time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen… Is he condensing a domain to advance to the Calamity grade? Carlos couldn’t move his eyes away when he saw the strange magical scene.</p>
<p>After running for a short distance, they realized that something was amiss. When they turned their heads and saw this scene, they were stunned.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen… He seems to have a pure human body… Youkai sized up Zhou Wen’s body as his expression tured even odder.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Youkai. Jiuyang also discovered the same problem. Zhou Wen didn’t have any traces of Spirit Casting on him, nor did he have the characteristics of a dimensional creature after using the Mythical Serum. No matter how he looked at it, he was a pure human.</p>
<p>He’s advancing to the Calamity grade as a pure human? Jiuyang stood there and looked at Zhou Wen in a daze..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1588'>Chapter 1588: Regicide</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Jiuyang had always believed that Zhou Wen had used some method to advance to the Calamity grade. Now, he suddenly realized that Zhou Wen was condensing a domain. Furthermore, it was completely different from what he had imagined. Zhou Wen seemed to be a pure-blooded human without using</p>
<p>any external help.</p>
<p>Can pure-blooded humans really reach this stage? Jiuyang looked at Zhou Wen with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>Godsfall’s expression was even more complicated. He didn’t have any blood left to vomit. Otherwise, he would’ve definitely vomited another three liters of blood.</p>
<p>He had lost his vitality from being struck by the lightning. Zhou Wen had been struck by the same lightning, but he ended up advancing to the Calamity grade. There was no justice in this world.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be like this… It shouldn’t be like this… The resentment in Godsfall’s heart couldn’t be appeased. He used his last breath to order the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to kill Zhou Wen. Even if he couldn’t kill Zhou Wen, it was fine if he could interrupt his advancement to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General accepted the order and turned to look at Zhou Wen. The purple flames in his eyes constantly flickered, but he didn’t immediately rush over.</p>
<p>Godsfall believed that due to his severed vitality and how he was on his last breath that his connection with his Companion Beast had weakened. All he did was repeatedly urge the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General received Godsfall’s repeated orders, but it still didn’t charge at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>He slowly turned around and walked towards Godsfall.</p>
<p>“You… What are you doing… I told you to kill him…” Godsfall roared at the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. He didn’t know what had happened. Why would the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General walk to him? He had clearly ordered the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to kill Zhou Wen. Why would</p>
<p>the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General walk back?</p>
<p>Godsfall was puzzled. At the same time, he seemed to realize something, He immediately sensed the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s information again.</p>
<p>Malicious Evil… Heaven-defying Slaying… Jinxes Master… What kind of f*cking Companion Beast is this… Only then did Godsfall realize that something was amiss with the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. Be it his Life Providence, Life Soul, Wheel of Destiny, Terror transformation, Calamity Zone, or</p>
<p>skills, everything was very wrong.</p>
<p>Just looking at it might not be much, but when combined together, Godsfall felt a chill run down his spine.</p>
<p>He had never seen a Companion Beast with such evil and vile attributes. Together with the Heaven-defying Slaying zone and Jinxes Master skill, this deepened the chill running down his spine. He opened his mouth to seek help from Jiuyang.</p>
<p>However, just as he opened his mouth, the spear in the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s hand slashed across his neck. Godsfall’s head was sent flying.</p>
<p>This development stunned everyone.</p>
<p>Jiuyang never expected Godsfall to be killed by his Companion Beast. He looked at the Tiger Soul General with blood still dripping from his spear tip. His face was filled with shock.</p>
<p>“Carlos, am I dreaming? Wasn’t that Companion Beast snatched away by Godsfall? His owner should be Godsfall, right?” Youkai rubbed his eyes in disbelief.</p>
<p>“You aren’t dreaming. I saw it too. He’s indeed Godsfall’s Companion Beast and it has indeed killed him,” said Carlos with an odd expression.</p>
<p>“A Companion Beast killing its master? How can that be? Furthermore, once its master dies, it should be reduced to ashes, right?” Youkai’s mind was filled with question marks.</p>
<p>Godsfall’s head fell to the ground as his eyes nearly popped out. It was obvious how he couldn’t accept his death.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast tattoo on his body dissipated with his death, turning into Essence Energy that returned to the universe.</p>
<p>However, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General remained standing proudly on his mount without any signs of dissipating.</p>
<p>This strange scene made everyone shudder. If Companion Beasts could kill their masters, then with so many Companion Beasts on them, they wouldn’t even know how they died if a Companion Beast attacked them one day. There was no way to defend against it.</p>
<p>The blob of light in the sky shrank as the domain power emitted from Zhou Wen’s body intensified. The restoration of the ancient city nearby sped up.</p>
<p>Ancient buildings were erected out of thin air, gradually restoring the ancient city to its original appearance.</p>
<p>Strange. Could it be that the Heaven-Opening Scripture’s domain is a Time Reversal Zone? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>The power displayed by the domain now was like reversing time, but the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder had nothing to do with temporal powers. From the beginning to now, he had never used a temporal item to advance.</p>
<p>No, it’s not temporal, Zhou Wen quickly realized the problem.</p>
<p>If it was a reversal of time, not only would the ancient city be restored, but everything inside would also be restored.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if there were any residents in the ancient city in the past, but there would definitely be creatures destroying it. If time flowed back, the creatures that destroyed the ancient city should have appeared in the reverse flow of time.</p>
<p>Now, only the ancient city was being restored. The creatures that had destroyed it didn’t appear. Furthermore, upon careful inspection, one would discover that many places in the domain hadn’t changed because of the domain’s power. Only the ancient city had changed.</p>
<p>‘What kind of domain is this? Zhou Wen kept sensing the domain’s power, but he still couldn’t understand what kind of domain it was.</p>
<p>The power of a domain was formed from two parts. One was the Essence Energy Art that one cultivated, including the Life Providence, Life Soul, Wheel of Destiny, and Terror transformation formed during the cultivation of the Essence Energy Art. These would have a certain effect on the domain’s</p>
<p>abilities.</p>
<p>The other important component was the Zone Core that one absorbed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could sense the portion of the Essence Energy Art, but he didn’t know what kind of power the Zone Core gave him. He also needed to constantly discover the domain’s abilities.</p>
<p>From the beginning, when the Zone Core severely injured Godsfall, its power showed some form of devouring and absorption. However, now that Zhou Wen had absorbed the Zone Core’s power, it produced an effect similar to the reverse flow of time. This made Zhou Wen momentarily unable to</p>
<p>determine what kind of ability the domain condensed by the Dao Sutra was.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also thought of another possibility. If one’s Essence Energy Art and Zone Core combined to produce a domain, producing a special reaction, it might also trigger a domain ability that was different from both.</p>
<p>Just like a chemical reaction, the combination of two different elements could form a new material.</p>
<p>Of course, this was only Zhou Wen’s guess. Perhaps it wasn’t a new ability. It was only because Zhou Wen didn’t know much about the Zone Core’s abilities.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Only a tiny portion of the blob of light remained. This portion transformed into a huge pillar of light that blasted at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>As the pillar of light descended on Zhou Wen, the entire Forbidden Land of the Gods began to tremble. It was as though a huge earthquake had happened. Cracks that spanned hundreds of kilometers appeared on the ground as everything collapsed.</p>
<p>The buildings in Sunset City collapsed one after another, and huge rifts opened beneath the city. Half of the city had already fallen, and the remaining parts were constantly sliding down.</p>
<p>The darkness in the sky seemed to be cut open like a curtain. It peeled off piece by piece, revealing the originally blue sky. The entire Forbidden Land of the Gods was collapsing.</p>
<p>So to advance to the Calamity grade, one needs to use the power of a dimensional zone as the price. Carlos seemed to understand something…</p>
<h3 id='chapter1589'>Chapter 1589: Zone Formation</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Youkai was rejoicing, “Thankfully, you forced the evacuation of everyone in Sunset City. Otherwise, not many in Sunset City would have survived such a huge disaster.”7</p>
<p>‘The Forbidden Land of the Gods collapsed more and more violently. Carlos and Youkai didn’t dare stay any longer. They turned around and rushed towards the exit of the Forbidden Land of the Gods.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Carlos’s Guardian was already at the Terror grade. Otherwise, it was unknown if he could escape alive.</p>
<p>‘The entire Forbidden Land of the Gods collapsed except the area near Zhou Wen. The ancient city had mostly been restored.</p>
<p>The ancient city had a mysterious and ancient aura. Buildings made of rocks had a very simple design. There were basically no decorations. Occasionally, one could see extremely simple drawings on some walls. They were also abstract things like landscapes.</p>
<p>Is this ancient city built by humans or is it an ancient city that originally existed in the dimensional zone? Zhou Wen guessed.</p>
<p>However, just as he was sizing up the ancient city, it suddenly shattered and turned to dust that rose into the sky. When the ashes flew into the air, they vanished.</p>
<p>‘When the ancient city completely vanished, the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder finally completed its evolution and reached the Calamity grade. Its domain power had completely taken form.</p>
<p>It has finally advanced to the Calamity grade. Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief. This was a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>He originally thought that he had made a wasted trip, but to his surprise, he raised the Dao Sutra to the Calamity grade and condensed a Calamity Zone.</p>
<p>However, up to now, Zhou Wen still didn’t know much about the Calamity Zones ability. He needed more time to understand it before he could figure out what kind of domain it was.</p>
<p>‘The dark Forbidden Land of the Gods no longer existed. The sky was blue. When the sunlight shone down, there were crisscrossed abysses everywhere.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was rejoicing, he saw a blob of purple light run towards him. Looking up, it was the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Shouldn’t he perish with Godsfall? Zhou Wen had been paying attention to the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and the newly formed domain. He hadn’t paid attention to the situation outside the domain and didn’t see what had happened.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Godsfall’s corpse on the ground while the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was rushing towards him, he was somewhat surprised. Just as he was about to stop the Tiger Soul General’s charge, he saw the ferocious tiger leap up. The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General transformed into a purple</p>
<p>flame that flew towards Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>It was useless for Zhou Wen to block it. The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General transformed back into a tattoo and imprinted it on Zhou Wen’s body—back in its original spot.3</p>
<p>Holy sh*t.. This. What’s going on.. A Companion Beast can return on its own without dying with its master… Zhou Wen was truly alarmed. He looked at the headless corpse that was sliding down the valley and couldn’t help but cry out, ‘Was Godsfall’s head chopped off by Tiger Soul General?”</p>
<p>“He was the one who chopped it off,” Jiuyang said as he stood not far from Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Was he really beheaded by Tiger Soul General? Zhou Wen was even more alarmed. Such a Companion Beast wasn’t only feared by others; even he was also alittle afraid.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast was one with him. If Tiger Soul General came out while he was sleeping and beheaded him with one strike, that would be such an unjust death.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss. He couldn’t fuse Tiger Soul General into oblivion or throw it away. Unless he could make Tiger Soul General die in battle, it was almost impossible to shake him off.</p>
<p>It also seemed difficult to let Tiger Soul General die in battle. The more this fellow fought, the stronger he became. If he really took him to a particularly dangerous place, Zhou Wen might die before he died.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, are you a pure-blooded human?” Jiuyang stared at Zhou Wen and asked. Although the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was very strange, Jiuyang wasn’t too interested in him.</p>
<p>Instead, it was Zhou Wen who piqued Jiuyang’s interest.</p>
<p>“Probably.” Zhou Wen looked at his body and didn’t discover anything different from a human.</p>
<p>After receiving Zhou Wen’s affirmative answer, Jiuyang’s expression became even more complicated.</p>
<p>“Can you tell me how pure-blooded humans can advance to the Mythical stage?” Although Jiuyang knew that Zhou Wen probably wouldn’t give him an answer, he couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>Up to now, the human experts at the Mythical stage and above he knew had relied on external forces other than Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The education Jiuyang had received since he was young and what he had seen made him believe that it was impossible for pure-blooded humans to advance to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>The teachings of the Holy Temple clearly indicated that humans were sinners of the world. They were punished by God and had natural flaws. It was impossible for them to advance to the Mythical stage as humans.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen in front of him made Jiuyang suspect the teachings of the Holy Temple for the first time.</p>
<p>“Having nine Life Providences and nine Life Souls allows the advancement to the Mythical stage. Of course, it’s only a possibility. The chances are very low and the possibility of failure is very high.” Zhou Wen answered Jiuyang unexpectedly.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>In fact, this wasn’t considered a secret. This was because Xia Jiuhuang had previously attempted this method. Furthermore, Jing Daoxian had told him this method, so Jing Daoxian definitely knew about it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t believe that the other families didn’t have any information about this.</p>
<p>However, no one could do it. Apart from Xia Jiuhuang who used an inhuman forbidden technique, no one else could gather the nine Life Providences and nine Life Souls.</p>
<p>“You have nine Life Providences and Life Souls?” Jiuyang was stunned as he asked Zhou Wen in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Guess,” Zhou Wen said with a smile. He suddenly instant transmitted to a spot and reached out to grab the Connate Insight that had fallen to the ground. Then, he teleported away and instantly vanished.</p>
<p>He had already achieved his goal here. There was no need for him to continue wasting time. Furthermore, he wasn interested in continuing the battle with Jiuyang.</p>
<p>Jiuyang was very strong, but Zhou Wen had already seen through him. Furthermore, he had gained insight into the Nondisputatious Sword Intent. There was no point in continuing the battle. Furthermore, he didn’t plan on killing Jiuyang.</p>
<p>Previously, when the lightning struck, Jiuyang had tried to help him block it. Regardless of the reason for helping him, Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to kill him now.</p>
<p>In contrast, Zhou Wen was still very interested in the Connate Insight. Godsfall could use the power of the Connate Insight to reach the Heaven level, so it was obvious that it was at least a Heaven level item.</p>
<p>Jiuyang didn’t snatch the Connate Insight because it was useless to him. He couldnt stimulate its power.</p>
<p>Besides, before Godsfall’s death, Jiuyang wasn’t willing to touch the Connate Insight. Otherwise, it would easily trigger a misunderstanding between the Connate Holy Temple and the Sun God Holy Temple.</p>
<p>Later on, Godsfall’s death, as well as Zhou Wen’s advancement to the Calamity grade as a pure-blooded human, shocked Jiuyang greatly. His attention wasn’t on the Connate Insight that had fallen to the side.</p>
<p>Of course, it was mainly because it was useless to him. Therefore, Jiuyang didn’t take the Connate Insight seriously.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was different. The appearance of the Zone Core fragments triggered by the Connate Insight made him feel that he might be able to use it..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1590'>Chapter 1590: Teacher Domain</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen carried Demonic Neonate back to Guide City. The Holy Land probably wouldnt cause him any trouble so soon after Godsfall’s death.</p>
<p>After all, there weren’t many existences like Godsfall and Jiuyang in the Holy Land. Otherwise, the Holy Land would have long controlled the entire Federation.</p>
<p>However, with high speeds at which anomalies happened on Earth, troubles would only become more prevalent in the future. Zhou Wen also felt that he had to find a dimensional zone to establish a city as soon as possible. Otherwise, any Calamity creature that came might destroy all the humans in Guide</p>
<p>City.</p>
<p>I wonder how Li Xuan and company are doing. Have they found the dimensional zone that Xia Xuanyue mentioned? Zhou Wen played with the Connate Insight in his hand.</p>
<p>From Zhou Wen’s point of view, it was a stone talisman. He could sense the mysterious energy within, but he didn’t know how to trigger it.</p>
<p>He attempted to use the power of the Dao Sutra to drive the stone talisman. After all, the Dao Sutra’s Zone Core was lured out by the stone talisman.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was quickly disappointed. He realized that the stone talisman rejected the Dao Sutra’s Essence Energy.</p>
<p>The reason the stone talisman could trigger the Zone Core fragments wasnt because of the attraction between them, but because of their repelling forces. To put it simply, it was like the meeting of two enemies.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Connate Insight could draw out the core fragments, and the core fragments immediately targeted the Connate Insight-wielding Godsfall. He died quite an unjust death.</p>
<p>He had not expected to find himself in a dimensional zone that perfectly restrained him and the Connate Insight.</p>
<p>If the dimensional zone was intact, Godsfall would have long discovered this problem. Unfortunately, the dimensional zone was ina half-crippled state with its core shattered. Godsfall never expected such a situation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried a few more Essence Energy Arts, but he was unable to activate the power of the Connate Insight. All he could do was put it away before taking out his phone to study the new domain.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Calamity Zone: Teacher Domain (Human Realm)</p>
<p>Teacher Domain: Domain of Education</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>What kind of domain is the Teacher Domain? Could it be the domain for being a teacher? Zhou Wen looked at the information on the Teacher Domain and still didn’t understand what kind of domain it was.</p>
<p>He knew the word “education, ” but he couldn’t figure out how a domain could educate others.</p>
<p>Could it be that the domain also teaches physics and chemistry, as well as singing and dancing?Zhou Wen imagined the scene and a dark cloud immediately appeared over his head.</p>
<p>No, I have to figure it out. Just as Zhou Wen was about to switch on his phone and find a dungeon to study the power of the Teacher Domain, he heard the door open.</p>
<p>The baby bear extended its tongue and ran over excitedly. It pounced on Zhou Wen and licked his face, slathering him in saliva.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly hugged the baby bear and calmed it down before wiping the saliva from his face.</p>
<p>‘When the baby bear saw Zhou Wen, it appeared abnormally excited. It would occasionally nudge Zhou Wen, preventing him from using his phone. All he could do was put it away.</p>
<p>“Has Jiuyang’s matter been resolved?” Li Xuan walked in and said with a smile.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t know when they will come again, so you have to speed up. Find a dimensional zone that’s suitable for building a city. I’s best if it’s the kind of dimensional zone that even Calamity creatures can’t enter without our permission,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s expression immediately fell. “It’s not like you don’t know how odd the dimensional zones near Guide City are. I recently explored all the nearby dimensional zones that I could enter. I nearly lost my life, but I failed to find a suitable place to build a city. Do you think Xia Xuanyue is joking with us?</p>
<p>Perhaps there’s no such dimensional zone at all. It’s impossible for there to be no clues if it really exists!”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head. “I don’t think so. She’s here to cooperate. There’s no benefit in lying to us, and we don’t suffer any losses.”</p>
<p>“If there’s really no other way, give her some benefits. If it’s really suitable for the building of the city, it won’t be a loss. It’s better than being in such a disadvantaged position, right?” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“That’s the only way if you really can’t find anywhere suitable. By the way, which dimensional zones can’t you enter? Make a list of them. I’ll visit them.” Zhou Wen still planned on taking a look himself.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if he visited more dimensional zones, he might be able to find a Zone Core.</p>
<p>“Thave it saved. I’ll send it to you now.” Li Xuan took out his phone and sent a message to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took out his phone and took a look. Wow, there were more than ten dimensional zones with their names and addresses listed. From the looks of it, Li Xuan had worked hard.</p>
<p>“These can’t be entered?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>With Li Xuan’s abilities, was it that difficult to enter a dimensional zone? It wasn’t as though he wanted him to conquer the dimensional zones.</p>
<p>“Don’t you know how odd the dimensional zones in this crappy place are?” Li Xuan rolled his eyes at him and said angrily.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll visit them now.’ Zhou Wen got up and prepared to leave. When he reached the door, he seemed to think of something as he stopped and looked at Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Why are you looking at me? Have you never seen a handsome guy before?” Li Xuan felt a little uncomfortable being looked at by Zhou Wen as he shouted.</p>
<p>“Do you know this thing?” Zhou Wen took out the Connate Insight and held it in front of Li Xuan with his fingers.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s cultivation foundation was also the Invincible Connate Divine Art. Although it was incomplete, he could be considered half a member of the Connate Holy Temple. Perhaps he could use it.</p>
<p>“This thing looks a little familiar. Let me think.” Li Xuan pondered for a moment before slapping his thigh. ‘T’ve seen this before.”</p>
<p>“Where have you seen it?” Zhou Wen was alarmed, imagining that Li Xuan knew what the stone talisman was.</p>
<p>“You still want to test me? Don’t you know that I’m well-versed in everything from astronomy to geology? This thing is a magatama, right? It’s something from overseas. In the past, Li Mobai had brought some back from overseas. Although he called them divine artifacts, they were actually useless—nothing</p>
<p>more than an accessory,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Have you seen such a mark on the magatama?” Zhou Wen pointed at the horizontal marks on the Connate Insight.</p>
<p>Li Xuan took a closer look and said in puzzlement, ‘I’ve never seen such magatama. Typical magatama should have a hole at the head. Why is this spot empty?”</p>
<p>“This is called yao. The long lines are Yang, while the short lines are called Yin. Together they form hexagrams. You know about the Eight Trigrams, right?” Zhou Wen threw the Connate Insight to Li Xuan. ‘I got it from a Saint from the Connate Holy Temple. It seems like only Saints who cultivate the</p>
<p>Invincible Connate Divine Art can trigger its power. Try and see if you can use it.”</p>
<p>“”Thave to give it a try then.” Li Xuan caught the Connate Insight and circulated his Essence Energy Art, attempting to inject Essence Energy into it..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1591'>Chapter 1591: Blessing Halo</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Li Xuan’’s face flushed red, but there was still no reaction from the Connate Insight.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, don’t tell me you randomly picked up a stone by the side of the road to bullsh*t me?” Li Xuan asked Zhou Wen with a look of suspicion.</p>
<p>“Thave better things to do.” Zhou Wen took back the Connate Insight and curled his lips. “It’s definitely because your training isn’t up to par. Otherwise, why can’t you use it when the Connate Holy Temple’s Saint can?”</p>
<p>“Tch, that’s because it’s beneath me. How good can something from the Connate Holy Temple be? I want to create a path that belongs to me. I’ll kill all those Connate Saints later and let them know who’s the orthodox one. I like to forge my own path and force others to have no other paths to take.” Li Xuan</p>
<p>wore a look of contempt.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll pay a visit to those dimensional zones.” Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered to waste his breath on him. He walked out and the baby bear followed behind him.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen left, Li Xuan cursed under his breath hatefully, “What the hell is that crap? How dare you discriminate against me? When I destroy the Connate Holy Temple in the future, I won’t allow anyone to cultivate the Invincible Connate Divine Art again. I’ll make sure you are never used by others.</p>
<p>Til tum you into a useless piece of trash.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Li Xuan didn’t want it, but he really didn’t have the ability to use it. After all, his Invincible Connate Divine Art wasn’t pure. Few people who practiced the orthodox version in the Connate Holy Temple could use the Connate Insight, much less a pirated version.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the baby bear beside him and had a nagging feeling that something was amiss, but he couldn’t recall it.</p>
<p>Strange, why do I feel like I’ve forgotten something? Zhou Wen frowned in thought, but after some thought, he couldn’t figure out what was amiss.</p>
<p>Ya’er was with the An family while Chick was still evolving to the Calamity grade. The antelope had been following Ya’er and didn’t come along, This was also the reason Zhou Wen felt at ease letting Ya‘er stay with the An family.</p>
<p>With the antelope by Ya’er’s side, it could escape with Ya’er even if they encountered an invincible opponent.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought carefully and thought that he was missing something, He opened the chaos space and did a headcount.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately realized what he had forgotten. He had left Liz and Leem in the chaos space.1</p>
<p>How did I forget them? Seeing that there was no one around, Zhou Wen decided to release them.</p>
<p>“Master.” After Liz and Leena came out, they immediately prostrated before Zhou Wen. They showed no resentment despite being confined for so long.</p>
<p>“Get up. From now on, you are not allowed to call me master.” It was fine in Regretless City, but if anyone in the Federation saw Liz and Leem call him master, there would be plenty of opportunity for misunderstandings.</p>
<p>“Your Devilish Excellency…” Liz and Leem wanted to address him by his title, but they were stopped by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“You aren’t allowed to call me Your Devilish Excellency either. In the future, just call me Zhou Wen. This is an order.” Zhou Wen knew that it was impossible to reason with them, so he went straight to the point.</p>
<p>“Yes… Mas… Zhou… Wen…” Although the two sisters didn’t know why the Devil King wanted them to call him that, they were willing to obey unconditionally. They didn’t know what the words “Zhou Wen” meant.</p>
<p>‘When they called Zhou Wen, they were actually thinking about Your Devilish Excellency. They made a name into an honorific. Therefore, when they addressed Zhou Wen by name, their intonation sounded odd.</p>
<p>After the two sisters stood up, they realized that there were all sorts of plants everywhere. There were also various insects and beasts shuttling through the forest. Birds flew in the sky, and the baby bear, who was still following Zhou Wen, was momentarily stunned.</p>
<p>Having lived in Regretless City, they had never seen such a scene. They thought that this was heaven.</p>
<p>“Is this… Is this heaven?” Liz and Leem muttered to themselves in confusion.</p>
<p>Of course not. Humanity is now in deep waters and can die at any moment. If this were heaven, I reckon no one would be willing to go to heaven after death, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>“Sorry… Sorry…” Only then did Liz and Leem recall that their master was the Devil King, How could they mention heaven in front of him? They hurriedly apologized.</p>
<p>“This place is the same as Regretless City. There are also many humans here, but the humans here are different from the humans in Regretless City. Many of the humans here are very evil and can kill you at any time. Therefore, if you encounter other humans in the future, don’t randomly talk to them,</p>
<p>much less tell anyone about how you come from Regretless City. In the future, you have to obey my orders…” Zhou Wen told them some things to facilitate their adaptation to life on Earth.</p>
<p>Liz and Leem listened attentively to Zhou Wen’s teachings and memorized every word.</p>
<p>“Liz, release your Blessing Halo.” After Zhou Wen told them everything he could think of, he thought of her abilities and wanted to see what effects her Blessing Halo had.</p>
<p>Liz’s Life Providence and Life Soul were blessing powers, while Leem’s were curse powers. Both were very useful.</p>
<p>“Yes, Zhou Wen.” Liz immediately used her Life Soul.</p>
<p>Acircular halo appeared beneath Liz’s feet like slowly blooming lotus flowers. Standing near her, he could clearly sense a strange force infusing into his body. The closer he got to her, the clearer his senses became.</p>
<p>Although this power didn’t enhance his physique, it made Zhou Wen feel comfortable.</p>
<p>“What’s the use of your Blessing Halo?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Ican find more when searching for Stone Root Grass,” Liz answered shyly.</p>
<p>How pathetic! In that place, no matter how good one’s talent and ability is, it’s all a waste. Zhou Wen led Liz and Leem to a nearby dimensional zone. Firstly, he could search for the dimensional zone, and secondly, he could give it a try and see how much help the Blessing Halo could provide him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have much hope. After all, Liz’s level was too low. She was only at the Epic stage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have high expectations for her Blessing Halo. It was fine as long as it had some practical use. If he had a chance of advancing to the Calamity grade in the future, a large-scale Blessing Zone would be amazing.</p>
<p>Of course, it also depended on whether Liz and Leem would have any other ideas after coming to Earth. Zhou Wen didn’t plan on nurturing them now.</p>
<p>After following the direction indicated by the map, Zhou Wen suddenly saw a white Companion Egg the size of an ostrich egg on the grass in front of him. Its outer shell was like porcelain.</p>
<p>No way? Is the Blessing Halo that useful? I can pick up Companion Eggs just by walking! Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to scan his surroundings, but he didn’t discover any ambushes or other creatures.</p>
<p>Am I really that lucky? Zhou Wen took out his phone and snapped a picture of the Companion Beast. It was really a Companion Egg..</p>

<p>Are the effects of the Blessing Halo that powerful? I actually picked up an Evolvable Calamity-grade Companion Egg just by having it activated. What if it’s activated for ten hours? Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>He felt that something was amiss. If the Blessing Halo was really that impressive, Liz wouldn’t have had such a tragic life in Regretless City.</p>
<p>A blessing is only a blessing after all, not luck. Even Wang Lu, who has so many Luck Companion Beasts, doesn’t have such good luck, much less Liz’s Blessing Halo. She’s only at the Epic stage. Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss, but he had already used Truth Listener to scan the surroundings several</p>
<p>times, but he didn’t discover any problems.</p>
<p>Apart from some ordinary birds and beasts, there wasn’t a single dimensional creature in a radius of more than five kilometers. The nearby dimensional zones were also very quiet. No break-out dimensional creatures appeared.</p>
<p>There’s no reason for me not to pick up such a high-level Companion Egg, right? Zhou Wen made up his mind. He summoned the Prisoned Dragon armor and put it on before carefully walking to the Companion Egg’s side. After making two probes, he picked it up.</p>
<p>Nothing happened. Zhou Wen successfully obtained the Companion Egg and looked around, but he didn’t discover anything abnormal.</p>
<p>There’s no stopping luck when it comes. I managed to pick up an evolvable Calamity-grade Companion Beast just like that. Zhou Wen was extremely delighted.</p>
<p>In the past, he had worked so hard to kill a Calamity-grade creature so that he might have a Companion Egg drop. Great, he was now just picking one off the road.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the Companion Egg and looked around before wiping his body. He muttered to himself, If [had known that the Blessing Halo was so useful, I would have released Liz a long time ago.</p>
<p>Since there wasn’t anyone around, Zhou Wen took a picture of the Companion Egg and hatched it in-game.</p>
<p>Soon, a beautiful white swan appeared in front of Zhou Wen. Moments later, it transformed into a pair of snow-white wings and appeared behind him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gently flapped his wings and instantly appeared far away.</p>
<p>This wing Companion Beast augments my flying speed greatly! Zhou Wen was even more delighted.</p>
<p>As he continued on his way with Liz and Leem, he got her to keep the Blessing Halo activated the entire time. Zhou Wen thought to himself, /f can pick up a Calamity-grade Companion Egg with the Blessing Halo activated, just picking one up every hour would be awesome.</p>
<p>Despite having this in mind, Zhou Wen walked all the way to the dimensional zone without picking up anything.</p>
<p>Ignoring the Calamity-grade Companion Egg, he didn’t even see a Legendary Companion Egg.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it was just a coincidence. It wasn’t the power of the Blessing Halo. Zhou Wen wasnt an insatiable person. He was already very satisfied to have picked up one Calamity-grade Companion Egg.</p>
<p>He threw all his energy into the dimensional zone in front of him. This dimensional zone was a river. In the past, this was the Yellow River’s old course. Due to the Yellow River’s change in direction, this place had almost dried up.</p>
<p>However, after the dimensional storms, it was filled with river water again, Furthermore, no matter how deep he dived, he couldn’t reach the bottom of the river.</p>
<p>‘What was even more terrifying was that one would sink in the river water even while holding onto a lifebuoy. Many people failed to leave after entering. Up to now, no one knew what was at the bottom of the river.</p>
<p>There was definitely a dimensional zone in the river, but no one knew what kind of dimensional zone it was.</p>
<p>There were two commonly proliferated legends. One was that there were water ghosts under the former course of the Yellow River dimensional zone. People would be pulled down by the water ghosts to replace them as scapegoats once they entered the river.</p>
<p>Although the versions of the water ghost legends were different, they shared roughly the same idea.</p>
<p>There was also another legend that beneath the Yellow River’s old course lay a buried ancient city. The ancient city under the river was the true dimensional zone.</p>
<p>The various legends were somewhat exaggerated, but no one had really seen the water ghosts or the ancient city. Furthermore, most of the people who had entered the river had vanished.</p>
<p>Although Li Xuan had an immortal body, he wasn’t good at swimming. If he really fell into the water, it would be difficult for him to escape even if he didn’t drown. Therefore, Li Xuan didn’t dare investigate this dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could swim pretty well. He had specially cultivated water-type Essence Energy Skills, so his combat strength in the water wasn’t much weaker than on the ground. Therefore, he chose the Yellow River’s former course as his first stop.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only planned on heading down to take a look and see if there was the legendary ancient city.</p>
<p>If there was really a legendary ancient city at the bottom of the river, he might be able to create a city similar to Atlantis. Perhaps it would become famous in the future and become a new, legendary underwater city.</p>
<p>However, just as he approached the Yellow River, Zhou Wen saw that the river water seemed to be boiling as it emitted bubbles in the middle of the river.</p>
<p>What’s happening? Zhou Wen frowned slightly.</p>
<p>He had never heard of such a thing happening in the Yellow River. He had only heard that the surface of the river was as calm as still water and that lifebuoys couldnt float.</p>
<p>However, the bubbles that constantly rose in the middle seemed to be a result of boiling. This didn’t look like calm stagnant water.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully observed for a while and realized that the bubbles weren’t formed by high temperatures. The temperature of the river wasnt high, and the bubbles rose from beneath the river.</p>
<p>Is there something blowing bubbles down there? Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to scan the bottom of the river, but the river was like a bottomless abyss. After scanning for more than a thousand meters, he still didn’t find anything, nor did he discover the bottom of the river. All he saw were large amounts of</p>
<p>bubbles rising from the depths of the river as they constantly rushed out.</p>
<p>If such an anomaly hadn’t happened, Zhou Wen would have dived into the river to take a look, but now, he couldn’t just enter.</p>
<p>As he was pondering over it, he suddenly saw the bubbles that had appeared in the middle of the river turn blood-colored. It was as though blood was gushing out from the bottom of the river.</p>
<p>The pungent smell of blood quickly entered Zhou Wen’s nose.</p>
<p>As the blood gushed out, waves began to appear on the river surface. The water level in the middle of the river clearly rose.</p>
<p>Something’s coming out?Zhou Wen had already sensed that deep in the abyss-like river, a behemoth was slowly surfacing..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1593'>Chapter 1593: Bottom of the River</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that the thing floating up would be a dimensional creature, but to his surprise, after a while, he saw a huge metal pillar extend out of the abyss-like river.</p>
<p>Splash!</p>
<p>‘The metal pillar broke out of the water and kept rising. The part that surfaced was black, as though it was made of raw metal. There were many strange patterns engraved on it.</p>
<p>‘The metal column was more than two meters in diameter. After surfacing for about seven to eight meters, it finally stopped.</p>
<p>The blood-colored river water that remained on the metal column constantly flowed down the patterns on the metal column. It looked like the metal column was bleeding.</p>
<p>What the hell is this? Zhou Wen sized up the metal column and suddenly thought of the Sea-stabilizing Holy Cudgel from Journey to the West.</p>
<p>They were both stuck in the water, but one was stuck in the sea and the other in the river. The way they appeared was very similar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but shout at the metal column, “Expand!”</p>
<p>‘The metal column clearly didn’t react, leaving Zhou Wen rather disappointed. However, it was just a spur of the moment. On careful look, he knew that the metal column was very different from the Sea-stabilizing Holy Cudgel.</p>
<p>The Sea-stabilizing Holy Cudgel was also known as the Compliant Golden-Hooped Rod. The two ends were golden, but this metal column was completely black. It was clearly not the same thing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen first stored Liz and Leem in the chaos space. He originally wanted to store the baby bear inside, but the baby bear refused.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg could only store creatures that entered willingly. If the baby bear didn’t cooperate, Zhou Wen couldn’t store it.</p>
<p>Thankfully, nothing happened after the metal column appeared. He didn’t have to worry for the time being.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at the metal column and decided to leave with the baby bear. He wasn’t afraid, but it would be bad if anything happened to the baby bear and the sleeping Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen turned around, he suddenly felt a huge force behind him. His body involuntarily slid towards the metal column.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly gathered his strength to escape the metal column’s suction force. However, he failed to withstand it. Even though he used all his strength, his body still slid towards the metal column.</p>
<p>The baby bear was even worse than Zhou Wen. Its claws scratched the ground, tearing through the rocks, but it still slid towards the metal column at an even faster rate than Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>With a thought from Zhou Wen, thousands of Sword Pills appeared out of thin air, transforming into swords that charged at the metal column.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>The Sword Pills struck the metal column, creating deep dents. If there was enough time, the metal column would probably be shattered by the Sword Pills.</p>
<p>However, the suction force on the metal column didn’t disappear. Zhou Wen and the baby bear were still sucked towards the dented metal column. Furthermore, the suction force was still increasing in intensity, pulling them towards it at faster speeds.</p>
<p>Come out! Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors and the Soul Mirror.</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrm Scissors transformed into a golden beam of light that snipped at the metal column. The Soul Mirror also used the Soul-IIluminating Divine Light on the metal column in a bid to store it inside.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Just as the Golden Wyrm Scissors approached the metal column, it stuck to it like a piece of metal sucked by a powerful magnet.</p>
<p>The Soul Mirror’s Soul-IIluminating Divine Light shone on the metal column, but it didn’t react at all. It didn’t get stored in the Soul Mirror. Instead, the Soul Mirror was also sucked onto the metal column.</p>
<p>It’s too late! Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and used Teacher Domain.</p>
<p>In the domains that Zhou Wen had already condensed, Human Sovereign Sacrifices to the Heavens was a healing-type, while the Chaos Egg was a defensive-type. Only the usage of Teacher Domain remained unknown, so he decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>When the Teacher Domain was activated, an invisible domain immediately enveloped the river. Zhou Wen felt his body lighten as the suction force from the metal column vanished. The Golden Wyrm Scissors and Soul Mirror were also unsummoned by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The baby bear in the Teacher Domain stopped at the same time and was no longer pulled towards the metal column.</p>
<p>Although I still don’t know what abilities the Teacher Domain has, it looks rather useful. Zhou Wen stood in midair as Sword Pills appeared from the void.</p>
<p>A portion of the Sword Pills appeared beneath the baby bear and lifted it up. More Sword Pills charged at the metal column like a surging river, constantly striking it.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>The metal column constantly caved in and deformed from the impact. Shattered pieces of metal fell and landed in the river.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The metal column above the water surface shattered and collapsed into the river, the result of Sword Pill’s bombardment.</p>
<p>However, the metal column above the river’s surface was only a very short portion. Such a strike didn’t seem to shake the foundation of the metal column.</p>
<p>With a thought from Zhou Wen, the Sword Pills charged into the river and constantly struck the metal column, shattering it inch by inch. Even the river water failed to lessen the Sword Pills’ attacks.</p>
<p>I want to see what’s up. Zhou Wen charged into the river with the infinite Sword Pills.</p>
<p>‘Wherever Zhou Wen stood, Sword Pills appeared out of thin air, warding off the river water. The Sword Pills constantly struck the metal column, shattering it.</p>
<p>However, the metal column was just too long. The parts Zhou Wen could sense exceeded a thousand meters. He didn’t know when he could completely destroy it if he continued bombarding it.</p>
<p>Therefore, after trying for a while, Zhou Wen gave up on the idea of completely destroying the metal column. He circled around it and, under the protection of the sword domain, headed deep into the river.</p>
<p>In the Calamity-grade sword domain, the Sword Pill particles were indestructible. Even if they dissipated, they only went from light to darkness. With a thought, Zhou Wen could switch them without expending any energy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen dived a thousand meters, but he still failed to see the bottom of the river. Beneath him was still a bottomless river. The metal column seemed to have no end as it continued extending towards the bottom of the dark river.</p>
<p>“L don’t believe you have no end.” Zhou Wen continued charging down.</p>
<p>The lower he went, the stronger the suction force of the river. The suction force on the metal column became stronger.</p>
<p>However, with the protection of the Teacher Domain, the suction force was useless against Zhou Wen. The sword domain tore through the river and served as an aegis for Zhou Wen and the baby bear to rush into the depths of the river.</p>
<p>After diving for more than three thousand meters, Zhou Wen finally sensed the existence of the river’s bottom. At the same time, he saw the end of the metal column.</p>
<p>Beneath the metal column was a gigantic toad. It was jade-white and crystalline, and it suffused a holy halo.</p>
<p>The combination of ugliness and holiness looked extremely strange.</p>
<p>‘The toad was constantly respiring in a bid to escape the suppression of the black metal column. The bubbles came from its mouth.</p>
<p>The black metal column pressed down on it. Every time it struggled, the black metal column would crush a parotoid gland on its body. Black-red liquid flowed out from it, dyeing the nearby river red.</p>
<p>As the toad exhaled, it produced a terrifying suction force that sucked everything nearby into its mouth.</p>
<p>Its mouth was like a bottomless pit that couldn’t be filled. And its main target was Zhou Wen..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1594'>Chapter 1594: Lusting Toad</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>However, its suction force immediately vanished when it came into contact with Zhou Wen’s Teacher Domain.</p>
<p>The toad continued sucking with all its might as it looked at Zhou Wen with eyes filled with greed.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t suppressed by the black metal column and couldn’t rush out, it would have long lunged at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhou Wen realized that the black metal column had penetrated the toad’s body and nailed it into the rocks at the bottom of the river.</p>
<p>Every time the toad breathed, the black metal column rose a few meters and was slowly squeezed out of its body. Large amounts of blood spewed out during the process.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was very willing to fight powerhouses, that was typically against humans. He always took advantage of any weakness of dimensional creatures to kill them.</p>
<p>Sword Domain activated as countless Sword Pill particles charged at the toad.</p>
<p>However, when the Sword Pill particles rushed out of the Teacher Domain, they were immediately sucked into the toad’s mouth. Then, their connection with Zhou Wen was severed as though they had been sucked into another space.</p>
<p>This skill is somewhat similar to Behemoth’s! Zhou Wen bombarded the toad with Sword Pill particles, but no matter how many there were, they would be sucked into the toad’s mouth. Not a single one was left.</p>
<p>Treally would have been helpless against you in the past. Zhou Wen saw the metal column in its body rise higher and higher as though it was about to be completely pulled out. Without any hesitation, he charged at the toad.</p>
<p>‘As Zhou Wen approached, the domain enveloped the toad.</p>
<p>‘When the Teacher Domain completely enveloped the toad, Zhou Wen discovered a magical scene. The powerful suction force that erupted from the toad’s mouth instantly vanished.</p>
<p>It felt as though the toad’s power was blocked.</p>
<p>The sanctified light on the toad’s body instantly dimmed. The toad’s body lost its luster as its originally snow-white crystalline body turned into a charcoal-like color.</p>
<p>Without the terrifying suction force, the resplendent defense over its body vanished. The Sword Pills surged toward the toad without any obstruction. Countless Sword Pills struck the toad like billions of arrows piercing through its body.</p>
<p>The toad’s body was covered in holes. Blood and poison flowed out. It looked disgusting and terrifying, making one feel nauseous.</p>
<p>The toad roared angrily, but it couldn’t release its strength that could only circulate within its body. However, its body was nailed to the bottom of the river by the metal pillar, preventing it from escaping.</p>
<p>The pitiful toad was crushed to pieces by Zhou Wen’s Sword Domain. Its body was completely shattered by Sword Pill, dyeing the river red.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to head over to take a look and see if there were any Companion Eggs, he suddenly saw a strange light fly out of the toad’s flesh. It charged into the cosmos like a laser and vanished in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>What was that? Zhou Wen frowned slightly as he looked up at the sky, but he couldn’t see anything in the cosmos.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>The huge metal pillar suddenly began to shatter. Furthermore, the originally hard metal seemed to turn into mud. It melted into the water the moment it made contact with the water. It was a shadow of its former hardness.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used his sword domain to ward off the river water before searching the toad’s flesh. He saw that there seemed to be crystalline moonlight seeping out of the flesh as he peeled it open.</p>
<p>There was a jade artifact inside. A moonlight-like halo seeped out from the artifact.</p>
<p>What’s this? Zhou Wen extended his hand and sucked the artifact over.</p>
<p>The artifact was crystalline. It looked like a basin carved from flawless jade. Even the jade basin emitted a blurry glow.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen rummaged through the flesh again, but he didn’t find anything like a Calamity Essence or Companion Egg. There wasn’t even a dimensional crystal.</p>
<p>What’s this? Zhou Wen held the jade basin and looked at it for a while.</p>
<p>He had never seen anything similar in a dimensional creature’s body. This wasn’t a dimensional crystal or a Companion Egg. There seemed to be a mysterious force circulating in the jade basin, but it was different from the toad’s powers.</p>
<p>‘The metal pillar had already turned to mud and sank to the bottom of the river. Zhou Wen searched the bottom of the river again, but he didn’t see the legendary underwater city, nor did he discover any water ghosts.</p>
<p>There’s only one toad under the huge Yellow River? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>It clearly hadn’t been a day or two since the toad had been suppressed at the bottom of the river. Why did it suddenly want to escape when he arrived? This was too much of a coincidence.</p>
<p>Just as he returned to the river surface, Zhou Wen suddenly saw someone drinking and roasting meat by the river bank.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian? Zhou Wen immediately frowned when he saw the person.</p>
<p>“This alcohol isn’t bad. Try it.” Jing Daoxian threw the wine flask at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“That Companion Egg is yours?” Zhou Wen didn’t drink from it as he threw the alcohol flask back.</p>
<p>“The Skyimmortal Swan Companion Beast isn’t bad, right?” Jing Daoxian said with a smile.</p>
<p>“So it was you causing trouble. What do you want?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian drank a mouthful of alcohol and took another mouthful of meat. As he chewed, he said, “The Skyimmortal Swan Companion Beast is pretty good, but incubating it will definitely alarm the toad. There aren’t many humans on Earth who have the ability to finish it at the bottom of the river.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Jing Daoxian without a word. He didn’t believe that Jing Daoxian would give him the Skyimmortal Swan Companion Egg for this reason.</p>
<p>“Do you know the story of a toad lusting after a swan?” Jing Daoxian asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it just a story of a toad wanting to eat swan meat?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Young man, you should read more. The protagonists of this story are actually two immortals. One is called Toad Immortal, while the other is Swan Fairy. At Queen Mother’s Immortality Peach Banquet, Toad Immortal saw the beautiful Swan Fairy and was momentarily unable to restrain his emotions. He</p>
<p>tried to molest Swan Fairy. In her rage, Queen Mother casually threw a Moon Essence Basin at Toad Immortal, stopping him from molesting Swan Fairy and banishing him to the mortal world.”</p>
<p>“To everyone’s surprise, the Moon Essence Basin fused into Toad Immortal’s body and could no longer be extracted. As the Moon Essence Basin was a gift from the Moon Goddess, Queen Mother felt some regret. She wanted the Moon Essence Basin back after allowing Toad Immortal to return to the</p>
<p>Heavenly Courts after experiencing certain trials.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart stirred when he heard Jing Daoxian’s story. Could it be that the jade basin is the Moon Essence Basin?</p>
<p>“That’s ultimately a myth. Even if that toad is really Toad Immortal, it might not be the same as the myth,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“It’s indeed different, but the Moon Essence Basin does exist. Furthermore, it’s already in your hands, right?” Jing Daoxian said with a smile..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1595'>Chapter 1595: Moon Essence Basin</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“What Moon Essence Basin? I’ve never seen it before,” Zhou Wen immediately denied.</p>
<p>What a joke. It hadn’t been easy for him to obtain it. He definitely couldn’t give it to Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian only smiled. “Don’t worry. I don’t want the Moon Essence Basin. I just want to remind you that you have the Skyimmortal Swan and the Moon Essence Basin. Toad Immortal won’t let you off so easily.”</p>
<p>“shall repeat myself. I’ve never seen the Moon Essence Basin. Furthermore, I’ve already killed it. So what if it doesn’t let me off? Can it crawl back from the netherworld and bite me?” Zhou Wen didn’t believe Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>“Have you forgotten the story I just told you? You only killed Toad Immortal’s mortal body. It can be considered as helping Toad Immortal escape. When it completely recovers its true body, it will quickly come for you,” Jing Daoxian said.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you want me to give you the Skyimmortal Swan and the Moon Essence Basin so that you can lure that Toad Immortal away?” Zhou Wen didn’t believe Jing Daoxian at all.</p>
<p>“If you trust me, I can help you,” Jing Daoxian said seriously.</p>
<p>“Stop joking. If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave.” Zhou Wen turned around and left.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian said, “You should know very well that you can kill the toad because it’s suppressed to begin with. That body is also a restriction on Toad Immortal. When it recovers and makes a comeback, it won’t be that easy to deal with. It’s a top-notch Heaven-level creature.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tumed around and asked, “Why don’t you tell me what you want the Moon Essence Basin for?”</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian had plotted to give the Skyimmortal Swan Companion Egg to Zhou Wen so that he could kill the toad. It was naturally a plot for him to obtain the Moon Essence Basin.</p>
<p>“Idon’t plan on hiding it from you. I need the essence of the sun and moon to help the Yin Yang Mirror grow. The Moon Essence Basin is a treasure for Moon Essence. It’s very helpful for the Yin Yang Mirror’s growth.” Jing Daoxian paused before saying, “However, I’m not lying to you. As long as you have</p>
<p>the Skyimmortal Swan and the Moon Essence Basin on you, Toad Immortal will be able to find you once it completely recovers its true body.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s put it this way. What do I gain by giving you the Skyimmortal Swan and the Moon Essence Basin?” Zhou Wen asked bluntly.</p>
<p>“Isn’t not dying the greatest benefit?” Jing Daoxian narrowed his eyes and said, “I know you can’t accept it, but how can there be so many things in this world that go according to one’s wishes? A young man can grow by suffering some losses. This is tuition money that you need to pay. As long as you don’t</p>
<p>die, you will gain experience from suffering losses. You can also get others to pay you tuition fees in the future.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I quit school a long time ago.” Zhou Wen turned around and left with the baby bear.</p>
<p>“Don’t think that you can fight Toad Immortal just because you killed that toad. The toad was only mortal, completely different from Toad Immortal,” Jing Daoxian said.</p>
<p>“That’s still better than you not being able to deal with a mere toad,” Zhou Wen said without looking back.</p>
<p>“Tll be heading to Yinxu soon. You can find me there when you need me,” Jing Daoxian added.</p>
<p>“Please go and don’t worry about me.” Zhou Wen waved his hand and quickly left.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian wasn’t in a rush. He took a sip of alcohol and muttered to himself, “When you meet the real Toad Immortal, you will naturally come to me.”</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen rejected Jing Daoxian, that didn’t mean that he didn’t take Toad Immortal to heart.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian was right. If the toad hadn’t been suppressed, it wouldn’t have been that easy for him to kill it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Teacher Domain played a huge role in his killing of the toad; otherwise, it would have been a bitter battle.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether Toad Immortal was as powerful as Jing Daoxian described, he had to be wary of him.</p>
<p>The pressing matter at hand is to study the Teacher Domain. This domain is extremely useful. Even if I don’t fight Toad Immortal, it will be of great use in the future. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and didn’t continue exploring the other dimensional zones. Instead, he teleported to the Moon.</p>
<p>He wanted to ask Lady Supreme Yin what the Moon Essence Basin was.</p>
<p>“Where’s the Misfortune dimensional creature I got you to find?” Lady Supreme Yin asked when she saw Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“About that… I haven’t found it yet…” Zhou Wen had forgotten about it.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Zhou Wen didn’t wish to do something, but Lady Supreme Yin’s requirements were too high. The attribute of misfortune was difficult to find to begin with, and it required something with low levels but with great potential. Zhou Wen had never seen such a dimensional creature before.</p>
<p>“Why are you here when you haven’t found it?” Lady Supreme Yin said angrily.</p>
<p>“Lady Goddess, I have something here. I want you to help me take a look at it.” Zhou Wen took out the Moon Essence Basin.</p>
<p>The door to Lady Supreme Yin’s temple suddenly opened. Moonlight shone out and landed on the Moon Essence Basin, sweeping it into the temple before closing the door.</p>
<p>“Lady Goddess, what are you doing?” Zhou Wen was alarmed as he thought to himself, Don’t tell me Lady Supreme Yin wants to steal my Moon Essence Basin?</p>
<p>“Where did you get this?” Lady Supreme Yin didn’t answer Zhou Wen’s question and instead asked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen recounted what had happened. After Lady Supreme Yin heard that, she sighed and said, “So that’s how it is. You’ve gotten into big trouble. Jing Daoxian is right. As long as the Moon Essence Basin and the Skyimmortal Swan are with you, Toad Immortal won’t let you off. No matter where you</p>
<p>are, it will be able to find you.”</p>
<p>“Legend has it that this Moon Essence Basin is a gift from the Moon Goddess to the Queen Mother. Is it true? Do the Heavenly Courts and the Queen Mother really exist?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>Lady Supreme Yin fell silent for a while. Only when Zhou Wen began suspecting that she had fallen asleep did she say, “There’s no Heavenly Courts in the world, but Queen Mother does exist. However, she’s not in the Heavenly Courts, but a dimensional zone on Earth.”</p>
<p>“In that case, is the Moon Essence Basin really a gift from you?” Zhou Wen said in surprise.</p>
<p>“No.” Lady Supreme Yin explained, “The Moon Essence Basin is actually a Zone Core. It was forcefully destroyed by Queen Mother and extracted from a dimensional zone. I don’t know what it was originally used for, but later on, it was used to suppress Toad Immortal. That’s why the Moon Essence Basin</p>
<p>was injected into its body.”</p>
<p>“Which dimensional zone does Queen Mother live in?” Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“Tt has long been destroyed in the Mythical era war. Even if you can find it, all that’s left is ruins,” said Lady Supreme Yin with a sigh.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately alarmed. “Who has the ability to destroy such a dimensional zone?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I’m on the Moon after all. I’m only partially aware of what’s happening on Earth.” As Lady Supreme Yin spoke, she threw out the Moon Essence Basin.</p>
<p>“Jing Daoxian is right. A Heaven-level Toad Immortal is a top-notch Calamity-grade creature. Ordinary Calamity-grade creatures can’t compare with it. Although the Moon Essence Basin is good, it’s not worth risking your life for it,” said Lady Supreme Yin..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1596'>Chapter 1596: Treasurefall Money</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“Toad Immortal is very strong?” Zhou Wen felt that Lady Supreme Yin was persuading him to give the Moon Essence Basin to Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>“Very. Otherwise, Queen Mother wouldn’t have spent so much effort to suppress it underground instead of killing it.” Lady Supreme Yin paused before adding, “A Heaven-level domain is already a complete domain. Compared to a Hell-level domain, there’s a qualitative difference. Furthermore, you are</p>
<p>only at the Human Realm. It won’t be easy to defeat it.”</p>
<p>Is there no other way? Zhou Wen didn’t think that the Heaven level was that invincible.</p>
<p>At the very least, Godsfall, who already had Heaven-level power, was killed by the Zone Core of the Forbidden Land of the Gods.</p>
<p>Now that Zhou Wen had inherited the power of the Forbidden Land of the Gods’ core, although he was still at the Human Realm, it wasn’t impossible for him to restrain Toad Immortal. It was just like how his Teacher Domain restrained the toad’s devouring domain.</p>
<p>“Toad Immortal and the toad are two different concepts. Toad Immortal’s powers are very special. Even Queen Mother wasn’t able to kill it. It’s obvious how terrifying it is.” Lady Supreme Yin continued urging Zhou Wen not to clash head-on with Toad Immortal.</p>
<p>“What kind of power does Toad Immortal have?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I only know that the power of moonlight has a restraining effect on its strength. That’s why the Moon Essence Basin was used to suppress i</p>
<p>creatures have reached their full potential resulting in qualitative changes. It’s not a wise idea to fight them.”</p>
<p>“Don’t take any chances. Although you might both be at the Calamity grade, the domain powers of Heaven-level</p>
<p>ady Supreme Yin said agaii</p>
<p>“Tunderstand.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>He took in Lady Supreme Yin’s advice, but he was unwilling to give up the Moon Essence Basin and the Skyimmortal Swan.</p>
<p>After returning to Earth, Zhou Wen thought about what to do.</p>
<p>He believed that there was a solution to everything. Although the Heaven Realm was powerful, it wasn’t impossible for him to win.</p>
<p>Til figure out the Teacher Domain first before thinking of a way to fight Toad Immortal. If there’s really no other way, I’ll lure it to the Big Dipper dimensional zone. I don’t believe I can’t kill it there. Zhou Wen never thought of giving the Moon Essence Basin and the Skyimmortal Swan to Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian was resting in a wooden hut outside Yinxu. Liu Yun was drawing a map.</p>
<p>“Old man, why did you lay a trap for Zhou Wen? Couldn’t you just negotiate with him nicely?” Liu Yun grumbled as he drew.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian said with a smile, “In this world, don’t place your hopes on the kindness and sympathy of others.”</p>
<p>“That’s not sympathy, alright? It should be a partnership,” Liu Yun said gloomily. “With Zhou Wen’s temper, it’s definitely impossible for him to give you the Moon Essence Basin. Without it to advance the Yin Yang Mirror to the Heaven level, I want to see how you can enter Yinxu.”</p>
<p>“He will come. In the face of death, a so-called temper is nothing,” Jing Daoxian said confidently.</p>
<p>“Are you that confident in Toad Immortal? My junior brother has killed Hell-level creatures before. The Heaven level is only one level higher.” Liu Yun was puzzled as to why Jing Daoxian was so confident in Toad Immortal.</p>
<p>“Toad Immortal is also known as Golden Toad Immortal. Its most famous ability is Treasurefall Money,” Jing Daoxian said slowly.</p>
<p>“Treasurefall Money? The legendary ability that can shake off all Dharma treasures?” Liu Yun was alarmed.</p>
<p>“That’s just a myth. The true Treasurefall Money is actually a sealing force. Be it creatures or weapons, be it humans or Companion Beasts, as long as they are struck by Treasurefall Money, they will be sealed. They will no longer be able to use any of their strength and become ordinary,” Jing Daoxian said.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Then isn’t Junior Brother in grave danger?” Liu Yun said in surprise.</p>
<p>Everyone knew that Zhou Wen’s main combat strength was his Companion Beasts, but Toad Immortal could seal Companion Beasts. In its domain, Companion Beasts were useless.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that Zhou Wen didn’t have a Guardian, even if he did, he would still be sealed by the Treasurefall Money.</p>
<p>Unless one’s strength far exceeded Toad Immortals, preventing him from using Treasurefall Money, it was very difficult for them to stand a chance of winning.</p>
<p>“With that punks life-preservation means, it should be more than enough for him to escape and seek my help,” Jing Daoxian said indifferently.</p>
<p>Liu Yun thought for a moment and found that Zhou Wen’s stumbling over while crying for help made him feel excited.</p>
<p>“Then let’s wait for Zhou Wen to come pleaing.” Liu Yun’s mind had already surfaced the scene of his junior brother rolling and crawling over to hug his thigh. He felt an unbearable itch, eager for that moment to arrive immediately.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have Liu Yun’s rich imagination. He was currently studying the Teacher Domain.</p>
<p>The Teacher Domain was formed by his talent combined with his Essence Energy Art and the Zone Core. His strength and Essence Energy Art’s powers were easily understood, but the power brought by the Zone Core was unfamiliar to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>After any creature fused with the Zone Core, they needed a process of figuring it out to unleash the true abilities of the domain.</p>
<p>Some domains were relatively easy to understand. For example, some high-temperature domains only needed one to change the temperature.</p>
<p>However, just because it was easy to understand didn’t mean that it could be used properly. A high-temperature domain wasn’t as simple as just blindly raising the temperature. There were also techniques to exploit the difference in temperature. Those needed to be figured out and practiced.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Teacher Domain was more complicated because it had very complicated abilities.</p>
<p>After constant testing, Zhou Wen came to understand the various abilities it had.</p>
<p>The most important ability in the Teacher Domain was to seal all nomological powers. In the past, the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder could only prevent Zhou Wen from being affected by various taboo powers. It was considered a passive ability.</p>
<p>Now, the Teacher Domain could seal all nomological powers and taboos within the domain. Essence Energy couldn’t be released and could only circulate in creatures’ bodies.2</p>
<p>Therefore, in the Teacher Domain, all creatures could only rely on their bodies to fight. It was almost impossible for them to release their strength.</p>
<p>All sorts of domain powers were sealed in the Teacher Domain. Most domain powers were ineffective.</p>
<p>However, there were some domain powers that were applied to one’s body. The Teacher Domain had little influence on such powers.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen still didn’t know what the limits of the Teacher Domain were or if it could seal high-level domains.</p>
<p>This sealing power wasn’t everything the Teacher Domain had. It could even be said that it was only the basic ability of the Teacher Domain. Some abilities were built on this foundation.</p>
<p>For example, one could selectively remove the seal. As for the person who used the ability in the Teacher Domain, the pattern and trajectory of the ability would be recorded by the Teacher Domain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could directly understand his opponent’s various abilities. He could even know the flaws of his opponent’s abilities through comparison using the Teacher Domain itself.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1597'>Chapter 1597: You Are An Exception</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen was still constantly studying the various abilities and uses of the Teacher Domain.</p>
<p>The same piece of paper had different uses in the hands of different people.</p>
<p>In the hands of an ordinary person, it might only be used as a diary or a post-it note. It might even be used to wipe one’s mucus, but in the hands of an artist, it might be a world-class painting.</p>
<p>Different people produced different effects on the same item.</p>
<p>No matter how powerful a Calamity Zone was, it required the user to have enough control and imagination. Otherwise, just the domain itself was strong, but the person ultimately couldn’t be considered a true expert.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was studying the Teacher Domain, he suddenly heard someone shouting outside. He listened carefully and realized that changes had happened on the Cube again. Another person was about to attempt the Big Dipper Palaces.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally didn’t care who attempted the Star Palaces. Even a Heaven-level creature wouldn’t be able to clear it so easily.</p>
<p>Taking the level with Starlord Cherished Kismet as an example, the stronger the offensive strength of a Heaven-level creature, the more miserable their death would be.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen heard someone shout out “fsukuyomi,” his heart stirred. He hurriedly switched on his phone and opened the livestream. Indeed, Tsukuyomi had already entered Dubhe Palace.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised that Tsukuyomi could reach a place as distant as Dubhe Palace.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that the other planets had Cubes, even if they didn’t, Tsukuyomi’s spatial teleportation ability wasn’t inferior to Zhou Wen’s. It wasn’t impossible for her to teleport to Dubhe Palace.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was thinking about something else. Tsukuyomi is the Lady Goddess of the Moon, so she definitely has the power of moonlight. And that toad is restrained by the power of moonlight. Doesn’t that mean that Tsukuyomi is the nemesis of that Toad Immortal? I wonder what level she has reached?</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was thinking, Tsukuyomi had already walked to the door. Two ghost phantoms appeared in front of her and pushed open Dubhe Palace’s door for her.</p>
<p>Starlord Ravenous Wolf seemed to feel pressure when he saw Tsukuyomi. He didn’t wait for Tsukuyomi to walk over before launching an attack. A terrifying surge of light blasted at Tsukuyomi like a volcanic eruption.</p>
<p>How will Tsukuyomi deal with Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s starlight domain? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn’t just Zhou Wen. Everyone was curious about Tsukuyomi’s performance.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi’s domain was called “Ghost Parade.” It had the ability to summon ghosts, but inside the starlight domain, the starlight attacked indiscriminately. Summoning a single ghost was actually not much different from summoning a hundred ghosts.</p>
<p>When the light blast descended, Tsukuyomi didn’t dodge, nor did she have any intention of attacking. Hashihime, who was wearing a kimono and seemed to be enveloped by darkness, appeared beside Tsukuyomi. The paper umbrella in her hand opened as blurry neon colors appeared around her, blocking</p>
<p>the light blast.</p>
<p>Hashihime held the umbrella and followed Tsukuyomi. Tsukuyomi slowly walked towards Starlord Ravenous Wolf. No matter how powerful the light blast was, it couldn’t break through her defense.</p>
<p>Just Hashihime alone managed to block Starlord Ravenous Wolfs starlight domain. From the looks of it, Tsukuyomi is already at the top of the Hell level, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>‘When Starlord Ravenous Wolf saw that the blast of light couldn’t do anything to Tsukuyomi, he immediately charged down, hoping to engage her in close combat.</p>
<p>However, when he rushed over, ghosts suddenly appeared. Starlord Ravenous Wolf was immediately surrounded.</p>
<p>It was difficult to beat a number advantage even for the best of people, especially when the number advantage was overwhelming. Soon, Starlord Ravenous Wolf was ganked to the point of death. Tsukuyomi remained standing under the umbrella and didn’t make a move. After Starlord Ravenous Wolf</p>
<p>died, she walked towards the teleportation nexus.</p>
<p>“Goddess Tsukuyomi is too powerful!”</p>
<p>“Ghost Parade. Who can withstand such strength at the same level? Whoever fights Tsukuyomi is equivalent to fighting a hundred alone.”</p>
<p>Before anyone could say anything, they saw a new scene appear on the Cube’s screen. It was the projection of Merak Star Palace.</p>
<p>“Tsukuyomi wants to challenge Starlord Titan Gate?”</p>
<p>“Of course she has to. Her domain is virtually invincible among peers of the same level. I wouldn’t find it strange even if she chose all the Big Dipper stars, much less the second Star Palace.”</p>
<p>‘As everyone discussed, Tsukuyomi had already pushed open the door to the Merak Star Palace.</p>
<p>Hashihime kept following Tsukuyomi. Just as the door to Merak Star Palace opened, the ferocious ghosts rushed in. A fox-like shadow rushed into Starlord Titan Gate’s body the moment he opened his mouth.</p>
<p>Starlord Titan Gate’s open mouth closed. He couldn’t make a sound. He lost control of his body and could hardly fight the ghosts.</p>
<p>Before Starlord Titan Gate could escape the control, the hundred ghosts had already surged forward and devoured him.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi killed two Starlords without even lifting a finger. She walked into the teleportation nexus once again.</p>
<p>However, this time, the Cube didn’t produce a new Star Palace. Instead, a ranking appeared.</p>
<p>Everyone hurriedly looked at the rankings. Their eyes landed on first place, but they realized that first place wasn’t Tsukuyomi. It was still the Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi was ranked second despite slaying two Starlords.</p>
<p>“How did this happen? Egg Sovereign used a Companion Beast after all. Tsukuyomi didn’t even use a Companion Beast. Why is she ranked below Egg Sovereign?”</p>
<p>“That’s right, this doesn’t make sense!”</p>
<p>“Of course, Egg Sovereign’s Tiger Soul General is even stronger. He killed two Ravenous Wolves alone and instantly killed Titan Gate. His strength is far above Tsukuyomi’s.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. The Tiger Soul General is undoubtedly stronger.”</p>
<p>People were discussing who was stronger—Tiger Soul General or Tsukuyomi. Soon, they were divided into two factions. No one could convince the other. All sorts of analysis threads constantly appeared on the Internet.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already teleported outside Merak the moment the rankings appeared. Now, he only hoped that Tsukuyomi hadn’t teleported over from the Cube on a particular planet. That way, he wouldn’t be able to see her even if he came to Merak.</p>
<p>After arriving on Merak, Zhou Wen quickly instant transmitted towards the Star Palace’s entrance. Before he entered the planet, he saw Tsukuyomi’s figure rush out of the high-temperature liquid.</p>
<p>Hashihime was still standing behind Tsukuyomi as she held the umbrella. All the high temperature, radiation, and shock waves were isolated by the umbrella.</p>
<p>“are you looking for me?” Tsukuyomi said with a smile.</p>
<p>“That’s right. I want to make a deal with you,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>Although he had a plan, Lady Supreme Yin had said that it wasn’t easy to deal with Toad Immortal. To be safe, Zhou Wen decided to buy some additional insurance.</p>
<p>“You know that I never make deals with others,” Tsukuyomi said.</p>
<p>“This deal is very beneficial to you,” Zhou Wen replied.</p>
<p>“Whether there are benefits or not does not concern me.” Tsukuyomi remained unmoved.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed, but he heard Tsukuyomi continue, “However, you are an exception.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter1598'>Chapter 1598: Battling Starlord Merciful Song Again</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen was puzzled. Although Tsukuyomi had always expressed her fondness for him, he really couldn’t figure out why she had such a favorable impression of him.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen, everything needed to be explained with logic, but he really couldn’t figure out why Tsukuyomi had a good impression of him. Therefore, he had always felt that there was something wrong with this matter. However, he couldn’t figure out the problem no matter how much he racked his</p>
<p>brains over it.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>If it was for the Heavenly Happiness Token, he had previously agreed to give it to Tsukuyomi, but Tsukuyomi didn’t want it. This reason was clearly not valid.</p>
<p>“Look at this.” Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out why Tsukuyomi had a good impression of him, but at the very least, she wasn’t a threat to him.</p>
<p>“This is a Zone Core?” Tsukuyomi looked at the Moon Essence Basin in surprise.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s called the Moon Essence Basin. Do you think it’s of any use to you?” Zhou Wen asked as he held it.</p>
<p>“Of course it’s useful.” Tsukuyomi gave an affirmative answer before smiling at Zhou Wen. “Are you giving it to me?”</p>
<p>“Sort of. However, its owner is a Heaven-level creature, Furthermore, it cares a lot about the Moon Essence Basin. It will not spare anyone who has it in their possession. It will come looking for it soon.” Zhou Wen paused before continuing, “I can give you the Moon Essence Basin, but when the time</p>
<p>comes, you have to join forces with me to kill the original owner.”</p>
<p>“Sure.” Tsukuyomi agreed without any hesitation.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to consider it? That’s a Heaven-level creature. Furthermore, I heard it’s rather terrifying, It’s also a top existence among Heaven-level creatures,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“What sort of considerations should I have?” Tsukuyomi asked Zhou Wen with a faint smile.</p>
<p>“At the very least, you should ask about the Heaven-level creature,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“There’s no need,” Tsukuyomi said.</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen didn’t understand.</p>
<p>“Even if I don’t agree to it, do you think I’ll stand by the side while watching you be killed?” Tsukuyomi said slowly, “Apart from me, no one can touch my man.”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>??Zhou Wen’s mind was filled with question marks as he thought to himself, When did I become yours?</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen felt that there was no point in continuing. Therefore, he threw the Moon Essence Basin to Tsukuyomi. “If it can be used, use it as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wish to give the Moon Essence Basin to Jing Daoxian, nor did he wish to return it to Toad Immortal. It was a good choice to use it to make a deal with Tsukuyomi and obtain her help.</p>
<p>After all, the Moon Essence Basin was useless to Zhou Wen. The Essence Energy Art he cultivated didn’t have any moon-elemental attributes.</p>
<p>“Even so, we have to find a suitable place. This place won’t do.” As Tsukuyomi spoke, she approached Zhou Wen and grabbed his hand. Then, she stepped into the void and instantly vanished.</p>
<p>‘When the spatial teleportation ended, Zhou Wen realized that he had arrived on a planet. It was barren without any signs of life, but there was a thick layer of ice in many places.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi pulled Zhou Wen’s hand and flashed to the bottom of a glacier cliff. There was an underground ice cave there with a snow-white fur blanket and some daily necessities. It was likely where Tsukuyomi lived.</p>
<p>“The universe is too dangerous. Terrifying cosmic creatures might appear at any time. I need two days to absorb the Moon Essence Basin. In these two days, I won’t have the ability to resist external forces. I’ll have to trouble you to protect me.” With that said, Tsukuyomi sat down on the white fur and held</p>
<p>the Moon Essence Basin in her hands.</p>
<p>Bright moonlight immediately rose from the Moon Essence Basin and enveloped Tsukuyomi’s entire body as though a bright moon was right in front of her.</p>
<p>One could vaguely see Tsukuyomi in the bright moon. The moonlight was as blurry as a veil, allowing one to only see Tsukuyomi’s beautiful figure from her silhouette. It added a mysterious beauty to her.</p>
<p>Two days. Toad Immortal wouldn’t arrive that quickly, right? Zhou Wen took out a chair from his chaos space and placed it near the entrance of the ice cavern. He sat on the chair and took out his phone to continue grinding.</p>
<p>As he grinded the dungeons, Zhou Wen remained sufficiently alert. Truth Listener and Great Brahma’s abilities were circulated to their limits. Any commotion nearby couldn’t escape his notice.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen chose to enter the Big Dipper instance dungeon. He had killed the first three Starlords and they hadn’t respawned. Zhou Wen went straight to the fourth Star Palace where the guardian was Starlord Merciful Song.</p>
<p>The last time Zhou Wen came, he was stored in the book in Starlord Merciful Song’s hand.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen didn’t give Starlord Merciful Song a chance. He summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors and ordered it to attack him.</p>
<p>Starlord Merciful Song didn’t dodge the Golden Wyrm Scissors. The book in his hand automatically opened as strange words appeared, transforming into a treasure beam that struck the Golden Wyrm Scissors.</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrm Scissors was indomitable, but when it was illuminated by the treasure glow, it involuntarily flew into the book and landed on it. It transformed into a picture of the Golden Wyrm Scissors that was imprinted on the page.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, is Starlord Merciful Song that impressive? They are both at the Hell level, but he actually managed to subdue the Golden Wyrm Scissors! Zhou Wen was alarmed. Starlord Merciful Song was stronger than he imagined.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen could tell that the book in Starlord Merciful Song’s hand was very powerful, but his combat strength wasn’t much. He guessed that as long as he could get close, it wouldn’t be difficult to kill him.</p>
<p>The key was how to deal with the book. In the past, Zhou Wen could only attempt to charge forward or use something as a shield.</p>
<p>Now, he had an additional choice. He could try to see if the Teacher Domain could seal the book in Starlord Merciful Song’s hand. This was also Zhou Wen’s goal for coming here.</p>
<p>Although the Teacher Domain was very strong, Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if it was still effective against high-level domains. He could use the Hell-level Starlord Merciful Song as an experiment.</p>
<p>Seeing the book in Starlord Merciful Song’s hand open again, the text’s treasure glow rushed out of the page and swept towards Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen also summoned the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder.</p>
<p>The Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder automatically opened as the words inside shimmered with a strange glow. The invisible Teacher Domain also opened and enveloped Megrez Star Palace.</p>
<p>The moment the Teacher Domain enveloped the Star Palace, the treasure glow that rushed out of the Starlord Merciful Song’s book instantly vanished. Even the book that shimmered with text lost its glow. The text vanished and the page turned to white paper.</p>
<p>Haha, the Teacher domain is invincible! Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he summoned the golden sniper rifle and pulled the trigger at Starlord Merciful Song.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Starlord Merciful Song had zero combat skills. He couldn’t even dodge a Human Realm sniper bullet. The sniper bullet blasted a bloody hole in his body.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept firing, but Starlord Merciful Song dodged in a sorry state, and because he wasn’t good at combat, he lasted until the seventh sure-kill shot before his head exploded.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1599'>Chapter 1599: Starlord Ardent Virtue</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>‘Killed Calamity creature, Starlord Merciful Song. Discovered Dimensional Crystal.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed that he didn’t see a Companion Egg. However, when he saw the high-level Essence Energy Crystal, his expectations were lifted again.</p>
<p>Previously, Zhou Wen had been raising the level of the Invisibility Cloak. The advancement of the Invisibility Cloak was relatively easy—having Essence Energy Crystals was enough. Therefore, Zhou Wen would gather solid Essence Energy from the Chaos Egg to raise its level.</p>
<p>However, the solid Essence Energy only seemed to be capapable of raising the level of the Invisibility Cloak to the Terror grade at best. Any higher and it wouldn’t budge.</p>
<p>Now that he had Hell-level Essence Energy Crystals, he could try to see if he could improve the Invisibility Cloak.</p>
<p>The Essence Energy Crystal’s value was only 200. The other dimensional crystals with various attributes were also 200. This was the basic value of the Hell-level.</p>
<p>From this, it could be seen that the Starlord Merciful Song that Zhou Wen had killed was the same as the Starlord Ravenous Wolves from before. They were in their most basic state.</p>
<p>If the Starlords of the seven Star Palaces are all at the initial stage of the Hell level, their statuses don’t seem to match the myths and legends! In Zhou Wen’s impression, the seven Starlords had a rather high status. It didn’t seem like they were only at the Hell level.</p>
<p>He fed the Essence Energy Crystal to the Invisibility Cloak and the other crystals to different Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>After the Invisibility Cloak absorbed the Essence Energy Crystal, there was clearly a powerful Essence Energy fluctuation on the invisible clothes. However, the fluctuation lasted for a long time without allowing the Invisibility Cloak to advance. Finally, the Essence Energy fluctuation gradually vanished.</p>
<p>The Invisibility Cloak remained at the Terror grade.</p>
<p>The Terror-grade Invisibility Cloak’s Terror transformation was invisibility. This greatly increased its invisibility ability, allowing one to remain invisible indefinitely.</p>
<p>This invisibility was a form of formless, matterless, and shadowless intangibility. It was impossible to sense the location of the Invisibility Cloak through contact between matter. Using detection methods like heat was useless against the Terror-form Invisibility Cloak.</p>
<p>After putting on the Terror transformed Invisibility Cloak, he basically vanished. Ordinary Calamity-grade creatures might not discover it.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t true vanishment. At the very least, Zhou Wen could hear the location of the Invisibility Cloak when he used Truth Listener.</p>
<p>Therefore, to be safe, Zhou Wen still hoped to raise the Invisibility Cloak to the Calamity grade. If he could hide it from Truth Listener, there weren’t many creatures at the Calamity grade who could discover the Invisibility Cloak.</p>
<p>If he wasn’t afraid that the Invisibility Cloak’s fusion with other Companion Beasts would change the Invisibility Cloak’s ability, Zhou Wen would rather use a Calamity-grade Companion Beast to fuse it until it reached the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I still need more high-level Essence Energy Crystals to advance the Invisibility Cloak to the Calamity grade, Zhou Wen was already considering where to get more Calamity-grade Essence Energy Crystals.</p>
<p>After clearing the area, Zhou Wen chose to teleport to the next Star Palace.</p>
<p>The fifth star of the Big Dipper was Alioth. According to the information obtained on the Internet, the Starlord of Alioth Star Palace was Ardent Virtue. Legend had it that he specialized in killing the imprisoned.</p>
<p>However, as there wasn’t much information, and the information might not be the same as the true Starlord, Zhou Wen couldn’t guess what abilities Starlord Ardent Virtue had.</p>
<p>After arriving at the Alioth Star Palace, Zhou Wen was surprised to discover that the Star Palace he had imagined wasn’t there. There was only a huge jade mountain.</p>
<p>The jade mountain was made of white jade and emitted a cold crystalline aura. On the mountaintop, there was a peach blossom tree.</p>
<p>The peach blossoms bloomed beautifully and the entire tree was pink. A man in white jade armor sat cross-legged under the peach tree. A sheathed white jade sword was placed flat on his lap.</p>
<p>Peach blossoms flew everywhere as the petals slowly fell, but not a single petal landed on the Starlord, It was as though all the petals would automatically circle around him.</p>
<p>What kind of Starlord is Starlord Ardent Virtue? Zhou Wen stared at him as he walked towards the white jade mountain.</p>
<p>Starlord Ardent Virtue remained sitting under the peach blossom tree as though he hadn’t noticed Zhou Wen’s arrival. He didn’t react despite Zhou Wen reaching the mountainside.</p>
<p>Starlord Ardent Virtue finally opened his eyes when Zhou Wen reached the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t see Starlord Ardent Virtue’s face due to the helmet. All he could see were his eyes.</p>
<p>The pair of eyes were unimpressionable. The eyes were definitely not ugly, and could even be described as good-looking.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, seeing those eyes made Zhou Wen shudder. It even made him feel extremely uneasy as a voice seemed to plead him to turn around and escape.</p>
<p>Evil aura!</p>
<p>There was an evil aura in those eyes that made him feel afraid.</p>
<p>As the pair of eyes stared at Zhou Wen, he had a feeling that he wasn’t a person, but a pig waiting to be slaughtered.</p>
<p>That’s right. This should be the Alioth Star Palace. The Starlord should be Starlord Ardent Virtue not Starlord Martial Song. Why does this fellow look like he wants to employ force at any moment? Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen had this in mind, Starlord Ardent Virtue did exactly as he imagined.</p>
<p>The white jade sword in his hand instantly unsheathed. By the time Zhou Wen saw it unsheathed, the tip of the sword was already at his heart, about to stab in.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The Bamboo Blade on Zhou Wen’s finger flicked out and blocked the white jade sword. As the blades clashed, Zhou Wen slid forward with the Bamboo Blade.</p>
<p>Starlord Ardent Virtue had vanished. When Zhou Wen sensed him again, he was already behind him. The tip of the white jade sword was about to pierce through Zhou Wen’s back.</p>
<p>How fast! Zhou Wen had already activated the Teacher Domain, but its power didn’t seem to be of any use against Starlord Ardent Virtue.</p>
<p>It was obvious that Starlord Ardent Virtue was a Starlord who was good at melee combat. He didn’t need to project his strength at all. Furthermore, his movement technique focused on speed and not instant transmission. The basic abilities of the Teacher Domain didn’t have much effect on Ardent Virtue.</p>
<p>However, in the Teacher Domain, it recorded Starlord Ardent Virtue’s every move.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen raised his Bamboo Blade and fought Starlord Ardent Virtue. Although the Bamboo Blade was still at the Terror grade, its hardness wasn’t inferior to a Calamity-grade weapon.</p>
<p>The continuous collision with the white jade sword failed to damage it.</p>
<p>Starlord Ardent Virtue had very high combat strength, and was in no way weaker than Starlord Ravenous Wolf. However, their combat styles were different.</p>
<p>Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s entire body was the weapon. He used every technique to perfection, but Starlord Ardent Virtue was different. He only knew how to use a sword. Furthermore, his sword was only a fast sword. It wasn’t as varied as Starlord Ravenous Wolf.</p>
<p>Among all the martial arts in the world, only speed was invincible.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal was already very fast, but compared to Starlord Ardent Virtue, it was as slow as a snail.</p>
<p>Moments later, the sword left Zhou Wen with many injuries..</p>
