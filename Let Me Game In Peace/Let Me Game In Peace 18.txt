<h3 id='chapter1700'>Chapter 1700 Karoman Is Here</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen held the newly produced Emperor Star and hesitated about who to use it on.</p>
<p>This thing was an improvement for anyone who used it. It didn’t have any negative effects. With an additional Emperor’s Life Life Providence, the other aspects were enhanced.</p>
<p>The best choices were naturally Truth Listener and Demonic Neonate. After careful consideration, Zhou Wen decided to keep it for Demonic Neonate. He would give it to her after she completed her evolution.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Zhou Wen preferred Demonic Neonate, but that the Emperor’s Life seemed to have the effect of gaining submission from dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Truth Listener was a violent person. It seemed a little difficult for him to rule a group of dimensional creatures. Demonic Neonate’s sinister personality was somewhat suitable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he only had one Emperor Star. If he had a few more, he could have all of them-Dragon Eclipse, Banana Fairy, and so on-have one. That would be perfect.</p>
<p>Of course, this was only a thought. The treasures in hidden dungeons didn’t even respawn in-game, making it impossible for them to be mass-produced.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen put away the Emperor Star and summarized his various Essence Energy Arts. He planned on advancing all his Essence Energy Arts to the Calamity grade as soon as possible. Otherwise, it would always be a latent danger if he didn’t reach the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Currently, the Essence Energy Arts that had condensed a Calamity Zone were the First Order of Chaos (Hell level), Qi Refinement Art (Hell level), Dao Sutra (Hell level), Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra (Heaven level), and Ancient Sovereign Sutra (Human Realm).</p>
<p>The only ones which hadn’t condensed a Calamity Zone were the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art, Godfiend Era, and the Demon God Catalog.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no clue where to go to have Godfiend Era condense a Calamity Zone. It was very difficult to find a corresponding dimensional zone to an Essence Energy Art of unknown origins. All he could do was slowly experiment.</p>
<p>The Demon God Catalog had a clear dimensional zone that was compatible with it, but when he thought of The Thearch of Chess Mountain, Zhou Wen found it a little thorny.</p>
<p>Even without The Thearch, just the four generals of the Mo family that Zhou Wen had seen in Chess Mountain weren’t people to be trifled with. There was a high chance that they were Heaven-level existences.</p>
<p>With the principle of doing the easier things first, Zhou Wen planned on putting in some effort on the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art. The Endless Sea of Stars was likely compatible with the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art, so it shouldn’t be difficult to find an opportunity to advance to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>He opened the Endless Sea of Stars dungeon on his phone and indeed, the choice of modes appeared. Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate to choose the hidden mode.</p>
<p>The Endless Sea of Stars looked like it corresponded to space. Every tiny planet corresponded to the stars in the universe. As there were too many stars, Zhou Wen could only slowly wander the Endless Sea of Stars. As he hunted dimensional creatures in the Endless Sea of Stars, he searched for the location of the hidden dungeon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s luck was pretty good. He found the suspected hidden dungeon after searching for a few days.</p>
<p>It was a tiny, inconspicuous planet. It was barren with nothing but rocks. Even dimensional creatures didn’t stay on it.</p>
<p>If it were any other time, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have paid attention to this place, but under hidden mode, the tiny planet emitted a black glow.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it should be here. Zhou Wen didn’t discover anything special about the tiny planet and prepared to land on it to take a closer look.</p>
<p>It looked like an ordinary planet, but when the blood-colored avatar landed on it, it suddenly felt an unparalleled suction force pull at its body, causing it to collapse to the ground.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen hadn’t advanced to the Calamity grade, he had a few Calamity-grade Essence Energy Arts. His physique wasn’t something ordinary Terror-grade creatures could compare with.</p>
<p>The suction force of the tiny planet prevented Zhou Wen from escaping as he was sucked to the ground. Its strength was unimaginable.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen first used the Calamity-grade Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s power to attempt to stand up, but he realized that he couldn’t escape.</p>
<p>Following that, he switched to the Qi Refinement Art, but it still didn’t work. He even used the Heaven-level Small Perfection of Wisdom only to fail at standing up.</p>
<p>The suction force on the small planet seemed infinite. No matter how powerful his strength was, it was difficult to escape it.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen used the Teacher Domain, he was finally liberated from the suction force, allowing him to fly freely on the tiny planet.</p>
<p>The Dao Sutra is still reliable at critical moments. Zhou Wen sighed as he slowly searched the entrance of the hidden dungeon on the tiny planet.</p>
<p>To his surprise, after searching the entire planet, he didn’t find anything abnormal. Naturally, he didn’t find the entrance to the hidden dungeon.</p>
<p>This is strange. This should be the entrance to a hidden dungeon. Why can’t I find an entrance? Zhou Wen attempted to push the tiny planet to see if it was like the Purple Star Palace. Only by pushing the planet could he trigger the entrance to the hidden dungeon.</p>
<p>The planet didn’t budge. Even Great Brahma’s power couldn’t move it at all.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the way to enter isn’t to push this tiny planet. Zhou Wen pondered for a moment and switched his Essence Energy Art to the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art. He deactivated all the other Essence Energy Arts.</p>
<p>After retracting the Teacher Domain, even with the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art activated, Zhou Wen’s body was still sucked to the ground. However, this time, it was somewhat different.</p>
<p>His body lay on the hard rocks, but he felt that the rocks no longer looked like rocks. They seemed to turn into some liquid or bubbles as his body gradually sank into the tiny planet.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Li Xuan had been very busy recently, giving him the urge to learn a clone technique.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was a boss who didn’t do anything. He had to worry about the hundreds of thousands of people in Guide Ancient City. Although he had the Zhang and Xia families to share the burden, they weren’t one of them after all. It wasn’t convenient to leave certain matters to them.</p>
<p>When will Ming Xiu and Little Yanyan return? The other representatives are back. What’s taking them so long? Li Xuan began to miss the two oddities.</p>
<p>When the two of them were around, Li Xuan would sometimes have a headache due to their annoying antics, but now that they were really gone, he felt that something was missing. At the very least, no one was helping him with the chores.</p>
<p>“Brother Xuan, bad news. Something bad has happened.” A fashionably-dressed young man rushed over and shouted as he ran.</p>
<p>Li Xuan looked at the young man’s attire and found it irksome no matter how he looked at it. He thought to himself, I have to think about designing a uniform later. Otherwise, these civil servants will look like hooligans and affect our image. I’ll discuss it with Old Zhou when I have the time. However, with that fellow’s odd aesthetic sense, it’s probably useless discussing it with him.</p>
<p>“What’s the fuss? Don’t you know how to be steady? You are now the captain of Guide Ancient City’s city guard. Look at you?” Li Xuan first reprimanded the youth before asking, “What happened?”</p>
<p>“Karoman… Karoman is at the city gates… He said he wants to see our City Lord Zhou Wen…” The youth forced himself to calm down, but his tone was still somewhat flustered.</p>
<p>Although the entire world acknowledged that Karoman was inferior to Human Sovereign, no one treated Human Sovereign as a human. In the hearts of the average person, he was still an invincible existence.</p>
<p>“What’s he doing here?” Li Xuan frowned slightly, unsure what Karoman’s goal was. All he could do was head out to meet him and figure out his goal.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1701'>Chapter 1701 Disciples Share the Burden When Matters Crop Up</h3>
<p>“Karoman, why are you here instead of enjoying yourself at the Cape family residence?” Li Xuan stood in front of the city gates, looking frivolous.</p>
<p>“I want someone.” As he stood there casually, he gave off the feeling of being high and mighty, like a proud son of heaven.</p>
<p>“If you want someone, find a human peddler. We are a prim and proper place which doesn’t sell people,” Li Xuan said with a twitch of his lips.</p>
<p>Karoman frowned slightly, but he didn’t flare up. He wasn’t worried about Li Xuan and Zhou Wen, but this was nominally the An family’s territory. Even the Cape family was somewhat afraid of Luoyang’s An family.</p>
<p>“Lend me Guide Ancient City’s Shiraishi Satomi for a month. Tell me how much you need in exchange,” said Karoman.</p>
<p>“How pitiful. You’re already aging at such a young age. Your ears no longer work. Let me repeat myself. If you want to buy someone, find a human peddler. This place doesn’t sell people,” Li Xuan said with a sneer.</p>
<p>Li Xuan knew about Shiraishi Satomi and Ise Island. When he heard Karoman mention Shiraishi Satomi, he guessed what he was up to. He naturally couldn’t hand Shiraishi Satomi over to him.</p>
<p>“If it wasn’t for An Tianzuo, you wouldn’t have the right to negotiate with me. I hope you won’t make a mistake.” Karoman frowned. If the negotiation really failed, even if he had to fall out with An Tianzuo, he definitely had to take Shiraishi Satomi away today.</p>
<p>To others, Amaterasu was only a powerful Companion Beast, but it wasn’t that simple for Karoman.</p>
<p>His Life Providence, Life Soul, Wheel of Destiny, Terror transformation, and Calamity Zone were perfectly compatible with the power of the Sun God Holy Temple. Otherwise, the Sun God Holy Temple wouldn’t have chosen the Cape family as their representative. After all, the Cape family was the faction of the Holy Emperor Temple in the human world.</p>
<p>As for Amaterasu, he was the Sun God of a pantheon. He was extremely compatible with Karoman and was one of the Companion Beasts he had to vie for.</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, Li Xuan laughed. “You really don’t need to consider anyone. Our Guide Ancient City doesn’t need to rely on anyone.”</p>
<p>“In that case, get Zhou Wen out. I want to see how powerful the legendary Deceit King is.” A cold glint flashed in Karoman’s eyes as he planned on ending the battle quickly and taking Shiraishi Satomi away before An Tianzuo received the news and rushed over.</p>
<p>“Alright, hold on a moment.” Li Xuan knew how powerful Karoman was. Now that his level was inferior to his, he didn’t plan on fighting him head-on. He returned to the city to find Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I’ll only wait three minutes,” said Karoman coldly.</p>
<p>Li Xuan couldn’t be bothered to waste his breath on him. After entering the city, he headed straight for Zhou Wen’s yard and explained the situation to him.</p>
<p>Karoman is the representative of the Sun race, and he also has sun-type strength. Amaterasu is the Sun God. It’s not difficult to understand why he’s so anxious. From the looks of it, it’s really possible that Shiraishi Satomi is really related to Ise Shrine. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and followed Li Xuan out of the city.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, do you dare make a bet with me? Let’s fight. If I lose, this Calamity-grade Companion Beast will be yours. If you lose, lend me Shiraishi Satomi for a month,” said Karoman as he held a fist-sized Companion Egg that emitted a purple glow.</p>
<p>“No deal.” Zhou Wen rejected it without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Victory was a certainty, but he wouldn’t use someone of his as a stake. This was his bottom line.</p>
<p>“Don’t force me to do something I’m unwilling to do.” Karoman’s expression turned cold as he stared at Zhou Wen and enunciated each word clearly. At the same time, the golden divine light on his body rose like the sun’s holy brilliance.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, he suddenly heard someone say languidly, “Coach, is this person here to cause trouble?”</p>
<p>“Little Xiuxiu, you’re back?” Li Xuan was immediately overjoyed when he saw the young man walking over from the main road. Finally, someone could share his workload.</p>
<p>“Brother Xuan, what’s going on?” Ming Xiu sized up Karoman and asked.</p>
<p>“This fellow is the Cape family’s Karoman, second on the Cube’s rankings. He’s here to cause trouble,” Li Xuan said casually.</p>
<p>Karoman wasn’t in the mood to listen to their nonsense. He said to Zhou Wen, “Zhou Wen, do you want to fight me or do you want me to storm Guide Ancient City and take her away? You can choose between the two paths. I’ll give you one final minute to consider.”</p>
<p>“Coach, rest for a while. A disciple shall share the burden when matters crop up. Leave this riff-raff to me.” Ming Xiu’s expression made it seem like he was trying to chase away a street punk instead of a world-renowned super powerhouse.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen nodded. He also wanted to see how much improvement Ming Xiu, who had returned from the dimension, had undergone. With him watching from the side, even if Ming Xiu wasn’t a match for Karoman, nothing serious would happen.</p>
<p>“Little Xiuxiu, are you up to it? Although this fellow isn’t much of a character, he’s still strong,” Li Xuan whispered to Ming Xiu.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry.” Ming Xiu gave Li Xuan a reassuring look before walking in front of Karoman. “Do you want to leave by yourself or do you want me to send you off?”</p>
<p>“You have a death wish!” Karoman was slightly furious.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that Ming Xiu kept calling Zhou Wen Coach, making it obvious that he was clearly Zhou Wen’s disciple, he didn’t even take Zhou Wen to heart, what’s more Ming Xiu. He was already filled with killing intent.</p>
<p>It was impossible for him to take Shiraishi Satomi away peacefully today. Karoman had already decided to serve a warning. Even if he didn’t kill Ming Xiu, he would cripple him.</p>
<p>Without any further nonsense, Karoman produced Sun God Light with a thought. Thousands of light streams shot out in every direction. It was really as if the Sun God was enraged.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu didn’t panic. He clenched his right hand and a sword appeared in his hand before he slowly stabbed out.</p>
<p>When Li Xuan and the guards standing on the city wall saw this scene, they couldn’t help but feel their hearts in their throats. Ming Xiu’s strike looked slow and weak. It wasn’t fast, ruthless, or accurate at all. It didn’t have any shocking aura either. It was soft and seemed to lack force.</p>
<p>Compared to Karoman’s dazzling image, it made one suspect that Ming Xiu would be instantly reduced to dust.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was slightly surprised when he saw Ming Xiu’s strike.</p>
<p>He knew Ming Xiu’s Tomorrow Sword Art very well. Now that he had activated the Teacher Domain to take a look, he immediately realized that the current Tomorrow Sword Art was indeed much stronger than before. In terms of realm, it wasn’t inferior to the present Honn Shinsakura. Even Zhou Wen couldn’t completely understand its profundity. It was only with the help of the Teacher Domain that he could identify its true profundity.</p>
<p>Of course, their Sword Dao was different, and there was little comparison.</p>
<p>When the dazzling Karoman saw this strike, his expression changed slightly. He couldn’t tell the trajectory of the strike. It was as though the strike had no origin or destination, as though it had been born out of thin air.</p>
<p>At his realm, he could almost predict the trajectories of every sword art. Such a situation surprised him. His contempt immediately vanished. He knew that he had encountered a terrifying opponent.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1702'>Chapter 1702 Silence</h3>
<p>Many core members of Guide Ancient City stood on the city walls to watch the battle. The Zhang family, the Xia family, as well as the newly arrived Niten Flying Immortal Palace’s Sei Gasakai, Honn Shinsakura, Shiraishi Satomi, and company.</p>
<p>Naturally, there were also many original members of Guide Ancient City. When they saw Ming Xiu fight Karoman, they felt somewhat uneasy.</p>
<p>Swordsman Tomorrow was quite famous, but compared to a figure like Karoman who was in the limelight, he was much weaker.</p>
<p>It was especially so for Sei Gasakai and the other people from the Niten Flying Immortal Palace. They believed that Zhou Wen was very strong and could fight Karoman, but who was Ming Xiu? They weren’t too sure and had some doubts.</p>
<p>However, when Ming Xiu really began fighting Karoman, everyone was shocked.</p>
<p>The intensity of the battle exceeded many people’s expectations. Although Karoman’s might was unparalleled, he didn’t seem to be overwhelmingly strong when facing Ming Xiu. It could even be said that he was restrained by the slow swordplay. It was difficult to determine the victor.</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou is really godlike. Just a disciple of his is on par with Karoman. It’s truly breathtaking,” Sei Gasakai said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“It was indeed the right choice for us to come to Guide Ancient City.” The Elders had long forgotten how they had objected to Honn Shinsakura coming to Guide Ancient City. Their faces were blooming with joy.</p>
<p>An existence like Karoman could only fight Zhou Wen’s disciple to such an extent. Guide Ancient City’s immense strength far exceeded their imagination. It was as unfathomable as the sea.</p>
<p>re</p>
<p>In fact, they had been rather surprised recently. The Zhang and Xia families had a large number of businesses in Guide Ancient City. This was completely different from what they had imagined.</p>
<p>It was especially shocking that the Zhang family’s princess, Zhang Yuzhi, was in Guide Ancient City.</p>
<p>In fact, the Zhang and Xia families were also very surprised. They knew that Ming Xiu was very strong, but they never expected him to be this strong.</p>
<p>“The Ancient City has finally produced a representative,” Zhang Yuzhi said with a sigh. It was unknown what she was thinking.</p>
<p>The person who was most surprised was Karoman himself. Ming Xiu’s sword technique looked ordinary, and each move looked simple and unadorned. It was even a little slow, but it brought him great trouble.</p>
<p>The most troublesome temporal-type attacks! Karoman had already identified Ming Xiu’s temporal-type abilities, but he still found it challenging fighting him.</p>
<p>Due to the time lag, the sword that Karoman’s eyes saw might not be the real sword. Perhaps it was a sword from a second ago, or perhaps from another second before. He found it difficult to deal with it.</p>
<p>Originally, Karoman wanted to defeat Ming Xiu using technique, but now, he was rather depressed. He couldn’t see the possibility of winning.</p>
<p>In that case, I can only crush everything with absolute strength. Karoman decided to release all his strength and carry out a large-scale destructive attack, preventing Ming Xiu from using those headache-inducing techniques.</p>
<p>Who cares if it happened a second or two ago. The power that burned like the sun for all eternity could destroy everything over time. As the representative of the Sun race, this was also the power that Karoman was best at.</p>
<p>Just as Karoman was about to release all his strength, he suddenly heard Zhou Wen, who was watching the battle from afar, say, “Guide City has thousands of years of history. It wasn’t easy to preserve many things to this day. It’s best if you restrain yourself. Don’t destroy the precious wealth that was a witness to history.”</p>
<p>Guide Ancient City was a dimensional zone. No matter how intense the battle outside was, it was difficult for it to affect the interior of the ancient city.</p>
<p>However, the area outside Guide City didn’t have the ability to protect itself. Once an existence at the level of Karoman completely unleashed his strength for a large-scale attack, the entire city would probably be leveled.</p>
<p>Although there were no more humans in the city, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to see the area outside Ancient City reduced to charred ruins.</p>
<p>Karoman sneered inwardly. Are you my father? Must I obey you? Of course, you don’t want me to use my strength to defeat this fellow. As for whether that crappy city will be destroyed, what has it got to do with me? I must take Shiraishi Satomi away today. No one can stop me.</p>
<p>As he thought about it, the Golden Divine Light on Karoman’s body expanded and was about to devour everything nearby.</p>
<p>At the instant the Golden Divine Light expanded, Karoman heard Zhou Wen say something like “how disobedient.” He didn’t clearly hear the words because he wasn’t in the mood to hear him. His heart was filled with horror.</p>
<p>At that instant, the Sun God power on Karoman’s body vanished without a trace. It was as though an omnipotent god had been struck down to the mortal world and had his godhood skinned, reducing him to an ordinary mortal.</p>
<p>The Sun God power naturally wouldn’t vanish. However, in Zhou Wen’s Teacher Domain, the circulation of the Sun God power was restricted, preventing him from releasing it out of his body.</p>
<p>Without the Sun God power, even though Karoman’s physique was still good, it was difficult for him to use it against Ming Xiu.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu didn’t take the opportunity to defeat Karoman. He sheathed his sword and stood there without continuing the battle.</p>
<p>As for Karoman, he looked at Zhou Wen in horror. He didn’t know how Zhou Wen had done it, but it was clearly Zhou Wen’s doing.</p>
<p>“I already said that if you want to fight, fight. However, don’t destroy anything here.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he removed the restrictions of the Teacher Domain on the Sun God power, restoring the right to use it.</p>
<p>“Continue,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Continue? Continue my ass! Karoman stood there with an odd expression. He didn’t move for a long time as ten thousand curses roared in his heart.</p>
<p>In Karoman’s eyes, Guide Ancient City was like an empty city, one that he could come and go as he pleased as though it was empty.</p>
<p>But now, Guide Ancient City had become as dangerous as a dragon’s pool or a tiger’s den in his eyes. It was also like an evil demon’s den that was enveloped by a mysterious demonic fog. It made Karoman feel reverence.</p>
<p>Guide Ancient City naturally hadn’t changed. However, the pressure Ming Xiu exerted on Karoman, as well as the fear from how Zhou Wen suddenly made it difficult for him to release the Sun God power, changed his state of mind.</p>
<p>It was hard for him to imagine that there were two terrifying existences in such a small city. It was especially so for Zhou Wen, who made it difficult for him to release the Sun God power. It made him feel fear deep down.</p>
<p>Without the Sun God power, Karoman was like a bird that had lost its wings or a horse without legs. The horror was not something an ordinary person could imagine.</p>
<p>Karoman didn’t know if there were any more terrifying existences in this small city, but he no longer had any fighting spirit. His lofty aura had long vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>Karoman didn’t move, as though an awkward atmosphere was spreading in the air.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we switch locations?” Ming Xiu spoke, finally breaking the darn silence.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1703'>Chapter 1703 Anasrava Gold Turtle</h3>
<p>Karoman turned around and left without saying a word.</p>
<p>“Why did he leave just like that?” Many of the people watching the battle on the wall were puzzled. They could only tell that Karoman and Ming Xiu had fought to a draw. Then, after Zhou Wen said a few words, he left. It was baffling</p>
<p>Leaving just like that? How boring. Zhou Wen felt a little stilted. He was using the Teacher Domain to analyze Ming Xiu’s Tomorrow Sword Art. If no one fought Ming Xiu after Karoman left, what was there to analyze?</p>
<p>“Coach, don’t do a thing next time. Otherwise, it will be too boring,” Ming Xiu said with a smile.</p>
<p>“If you find it boring, why don’t you fight me?” Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up when he heard Ming Xiu say that.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu’s situation was somewhat similar to Honn Shinsakura’s. If he could use the Teacher Domain to help Ming Xiu grow, the Teacher Domain might be able to advance again and reach the highest level of Heaven. “It’s naturally best if you’re willing to give me pointers.” Ming Xiu’s eyes lit up when he heard Zhou Wen. Having been in the dimension for so long, he wanted to know how much he had improved.</p>
<p>“We’ll talk when we get back,” Zhou Wen said as he walked into the city.</p>
<p>It wasn’t like he was fighting an outsider. There was no need for Ming Xiu to expose all his abilities. It was better to find a secret place to fight Ming Xiu.</p>
<p>After Karoman left, the more he thought about it, the more upset he felt. He guessed that Zhou Wen had a power that could restrain his Sun God power, just like how the long steps in front of the Alkaid Star Palace could eliminate Essence Energy-like powers. If I had known, I wouldn’t have returned the Anasrava Gold Turtle so early. Karoman didn’t believe that he was weaker than Zhou Wenit was only because Zhou Wen had a special ability that restrained his Sun God power. As long as he could crack that special ability, defeating Zhou Wen wouldn’t be difficult.</p>
<p>The Anasrava Gold Turtle was the Companion Beast he had used to clear the Alkaid Star Palace’s long flight of stairs. It transformed into golden armor to protect his body, allowing him to withstand the taboo power of the staircase.</p>
<p>Karoman felt that Zhou Wen’s power was similar to the staircase’s powers. The Anasrava Gold Turtle was likely effective against him. As long as he wore the Anasrava Gold Turtle armor and went to Guide City, he wouldn’t need to cower. He would definitely be able to defeat Zhou Wen and Ming Xiu.</p>
<p>However, the Anasrava Gold Turtle wasn’t his Companion Beast. He had only borrowed it. If he wanted to borrow it again, it would take at least half a month to borrow and then return it. Furthermore, he had to pay a price.</p>
<p>Karoman didn’t mind paying a price, but he couldn’t afford to wait.</p>
<p>Ever since he became a representative, he had never suffered such a huge setback. He couldn’t wait to defeat Zhou Wen to redeem his pride.</p>
<p>After some thought, he took out his phone and called a number. The call quickly connected.</p>
<p>“Pata, lend me your Anasrava Gold Turtle again.” Karoman directly revealed his intentions.</p>
<p>“Why? Do you still want to challenge the Star Palace? I advise you to give up. According to the information I obtained, Starlady Polestar should be at the Heaven level. Apart from Human Sovereign, I’m afraid no one else among the humans can match her. You will only be sending yourself to your death. It’s none of my business if you send yourself to your death, but the Anasrava Gold Turtle I lend you won’t be able to return. I’m not participating in this deal.” Pata’s words left Karoman even more depressed.</p>
<p>The Cube’s ranking was dominated by Human Sovereign, and he had been taught a lesson by Zhou Wen in Guide Ancient City. With Karoman’s arrogant personality, there was nothing that made him feel worse than this.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to the Star Palace,” said Karoman.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” Pata was somewhat surprised. With the abilities of Karoman, even without the Anasrava Gold Turtle, there weren’t many humans on Earth who could match him.</p>
<p>“If I want to defeat someone, I need to use the power of the Anasrava Gold Turtle.” “Who? Don’t tell me it’s Human Sovereign?” Karoman’s words surprised Pata. Who else on Earth could make Karoman so afraid? He even needed to borrow his Anasrava Gold Turtle.</p>
<p>“Guide Ancient City’s Zhou Wen has a special power that can eliminate my Sun God power. I need the Anasrava Gold Turtle to resist it.” Karoman didn’t hide anything as he recounted the matter.</p>
<p>“What a coincidence. I happen to be heading to Guide Ancient City as well. I’ll be there in at most half a day.” After a pause, Pata continued, “The Anasrava Gold Turtle is the nemesis of those taboo powers. It will definitely be able to help you, but in terms of price…”</p>
<p>“The same old,” Karoman immediately said in delight, having never expected that Pata would come to the vicinity of Guide Ancient City as well.</p>
<p>“Don’t be anxious. Let me think about it again. Let’s chat when we meet.” After agreeing on a time, Pata hung up. However, it was different from what Pata had said. He was almost at Guide Ancient City and didn’t need half a day.</p>
<p>After taking a look at Guide Ancient City, Pata walked straight towards it.</p>
<p>“Brother, please help me pass the message that the Ultimate Family Clan’s Pata is requesting an audience with City Lord Zhou Wen,” Pata said to the guard with a grin when he arrived at the city gates.</p>
<p>When the guard heard that he was from the Ultimate Family Clan, he didn’t dare take his time. He hurriedly got someone to report to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What have we done recently? Why is there always someone knocking on our door? First it was the Cape family’s Karoman, and now, there’s the Ultimate Family Clan’s Pata,” Li Xuan said languidly after hearing the news.</p>
<p>He wasn’t afraid of trouble, but it would be troublesome if there were too many problems.</p>
<p>“Take him to the meeting hall.” Zhou Wen was about to fight Ming Xiu, so he could only put it aside for now.</p>
<p>The Ultimate Family Clan had a good relationship with him. Lance and Sadie were his friends, so it wasn’t appropriate for him to slight the members of the Ultimate Family Clan.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw Pata in the meeting hall, he was first taken aback.</p>
<p>In Zhou Wen’s impression, the Ultimate Family Clan had handsome men and beautiful women with long legs. Lance could be said to be the most handsome man in the world, and Sadie was also a beauty among beauties. Her long legs were straight and snow-white, dazzling.</p>
<p>However, Pata was short and stout. He was probably only about 1.6 meters tall. His eyes were small, with even smaller irises, and his green bean-like irises darted around in his eyes. Together with the sparse hair on his head, he looked like a bald rat.</p>
<p>This was too different from the handsome men and beautiful women of the Ultimate Family Clan in Zhou Wen’s impression. He couldn’t help but take a second look.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t someone who judged a book by its cover. He said politely, “Welcome to Guide Ancient City. Lance, Sadie, and I are friends. If you need any help, there’s no need to stand on ceremony with me. You will definitely be welcomed with the highest standard.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much, but I’m not here on holiday. I want to make a deal with you,” said Pata with a smile.</p>
<p>“What deal?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>“Since you are friends with Lance, I won’t beat around the bush. You have a taboo power that counters the Sun God power, right?” Pata said bluntly.</p>
<p>“Sort of. Is this related to the deal?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I have a Companion Beast that can restrain your powers. Now, Karoman wants to use my Companion Beast to deal with you,” said Pata with a smile. “I can choose not to lend it to him, but the condition is that I’ll take a third of Guide Ancient City’s future profits.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1704'>Chapter 1704 It’s Time to Return It</h3>
<p>“A third of the Ancient City’s profits?” Li Xuan looked at Pata as though he was looking at a lunatic.</p>
<p>Pata clearly didn’t believe that he was a lunatic. He said with great confidence, “Don’t think that a third of the profits is a lot. If I lend my Companion Beast to Karoman, with his personality, he definitely won’t let this matter rest after suffering such humiliation. He might even hunt you down. When that happens, you’d even lose your life. What’s the point of having more money and resources?</p>
<p>“Therefore, wanting a third of the profits isn’t excessive. It can even be said to be a very reasonable price. This is also on account of your good relationship with some of the members of our Ultimate Family Clan. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have come here to negotiate with you. If I were to directly negotiate with Karoman, it would definitely be more than this price,” Pata said eloquently as though everything was under his control.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only looked at Pata with interest without saying a word.</p>
<p>Li Xuan said in exasperation and amusement, “Your analysis is very accurate, but are you really sure that a Companion Beast can do what you just said?”</p>
<p>“I knew you wouldn’t believe me, but it’s fine. I can prove to you that my Companion Beast is worth this price,” said Pata as he summoned the Anasrava Gold Turtle.</p>
<p>It was a huge turtle made of gold. It lay motionless in front of Pata like a golden statue.</p>
<p>The Anasrava Gold Turtle looked somewhat different from ordinary turtles. Its back was as smooth as a mirror, without any patterns that a turtle shell should have. Its limbs, head, and tail formed a unibody.</p>
<p>Li Xuan looked at it for a long time and felt that it didn’t look like a turtle. Instead, it looked like a softshell turtle.</p>
<p>Before Li Xuan could voice his thoughts, Pata transformed the Anasrava Gold Turtle into golden armor and put it on.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t be unfamiliar with this armor, right? Previously, the reason why Karoman was able to successfully clear the long staircase in front of Alkaid Star Palace was that he had borrowed my Anasrava Gold Turtle. And its abilities are far from that. If you don’t believe me, you can use the taboo power that can eliminate the Sun God powers to see if it’s effective against my Anasrava Gold Turtle,” said Pata confidently.</p>
<p>“It’s just a turtle shell. Do you really think…” Li Xuan was about to say something teasing when he was interrupted by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Your turtle’s name is Anasrava Gold Turtle?” Zhou Wen wasn’t angry at all as he sized up the golden turtle with interest.</p>
<p>“That’s right. It’s stronger than when I lent it to Karoman. It has already reached the Hell level.” Pata was somewhat smug.</p>
<p>He indeed had the right to be smug. In this era, the number of people who could possess Hell-level Companion Beasts could be counted on one hand.</p>
<p>“Anasrava should be a Buddhist saying. Buddhism has the so-called Anasrava Wisdom. It refers to witnessing the truth, a wisdom gained from abandoning all worries and disobedience. It’s also known as Buddha Wisdom. Such a Companion Beast shouldn’t be from the North District, right?” Zhou Wen said as he looked at the Anasrava Gold Turtle.</p>
<p>In order to cultivate the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, he had studied the Buddhist Sutra for a period of time. Although he wasn’t proficient in it, he knew something related to Buddhism.</p>
<p>The word ‘Anasrava’ represented perfection. It was a manifestation of great wisdom in Buddhism. To be able to use the name ‘Anasrava’ meant that this turtle was probably extraordinary.</p>
<p>However, what really intrigued Zhou Wen wasn’t its name, but because the aura of the Anasrava Gold Turtle was somewhat different from ordinary Buddhist-type Companion Beasts. This difference was somewhat similar to Zhou Wen’s Truth Listener. It made Zhou Wen suspect that it might have come from Small Buddha Temple.</p>
<p>Back when the three-faced Buddha gave three Companion Eggs, Zhou Wen chose Truth Listener. He wasn’t very sure what the remaining two Companion Eggs were.</p>
<p>“You are quite a discerning person. That’s right. The Anasrava Gold Turtle is indeed not a Companion Beast from the North District. However, in this era, Companion Beasts no longer have any limitations. It doesn’t matter where it came from. What’s important is that it’s in my hands,” said Pata.</p>
<p>“If I were to guess, would you tell me where this Anasrava Gold Turtle came from?” Zhou Wen said to Pata.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Pata frowned.</p>
<p>“If I’m not wrong, this Anasrava Gold Turtle should be from Luoyang.” When Zhou Wen mentioned Luoyang, Pata’s eyes flickered, making him even more convinced of his judgment.</p>
<p>“It’s not a question of where it comes from. What exactly…” Before Pata could finish his sentence, Zhou Wen interrupted him.</p>
<p>“Of course it’s a problem. Luoyang belongs to the An family. Since your Companion Beast came from Luoyang, it should belong to the An family to begin with. How can you use it to make a deal with me?” Zhou Wen said slowly.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, cut the crap. Why don’t you say that all the Companion Beasts in the world belong to your family? Do you want to make a deal with me? Don’t force me to lend the Anasrava Gold Turtle to Karoman.” Pata was somewhat vexed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored Pata’s anger and took out his phone to call a number.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, why are you suddenly calling me?” Lance’s voice sounded over the phone.</p>
<p>“Let me ask you something,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Lance found it odd. Zhou Wen and the An family were basically active in the East District and seldom went to the North District. He didn’t know what Zhou Wen was up to.</p>
<p>“Pata is from your Ultimate Family Clan, right?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Lance paused and didn’t answer directly. Instead, he asked, “Why are you suddenly asking this?”</p>
<p>By the side, Pata sneered and said, “Zhou Wen, it’s useless even if you try to pull strings. Lance’s reputation doesn’t matter to me. A third of the profits-not one cent less. It’s useless no matter who you get.”</p>
<p>Pata imagined that Zhou Wen was trying to get Lance to negotiate on his behalf, so he spoke without any mercy.</p>
<p>“I’m just asking. Do I need to take you into consideration?” Zhou Wen ignored Pata and said to Lance.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to consider me. As long as you don’t beat him to death, it’s fine.” Lance answered immediately without asking any questions.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately knew that Lance and Pata didn’t have a good relationship. It was even possible that this fellow didn’t have many good social connections in the Ultimate Family Clan.</p>
<p>If Pata had some social connections in the Ultimate Family Clan, it would be impossible for Lance to say such things.</p>
<p>“Got it.” Having made a decision, Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else and hung up.</p>
<p>Pata looked at Zhou Wen and said coldly, “Zhou Wen, I advise you to think it through carefully. Since I dare come here, I’m not afraid that you will attack me. Don’t force me to side with Karoman. You can’t bear the consequences, much less Guide Ancient City.”</p>
<p>“I’ve thought it through very clearly. Since I don’t need to consider Lance, it’s time for you to return what’s not yours.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he had secretly switched to the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Zhou Wen had entered a hidden dungeon in the endless cosmos. Furthermore, he had advanced the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art to the Calamity grade. Now, he could test it out with Pata.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1705'>Chapter 1705 Universe Inversion</h3>
<p>The hidden dungeon in the Endless Sea of Stars was on a small planet. After Zhou Wen was sucked into the tiny planet, he realized that there was a dimensional creature he had never seen in the Endless Sea of Stars.</p>
<p>It was a little similar to Planet Devourer. It looked very similar to a jellyfish. It had a transparent hemispherical body with countless tentacles below-way more than jellyfish.</p>
<p>However, this dimensional creature was only the size of a basketball. It wasn’t as huge as the Planet Devourer.</p>
<p>Inside the hidden dungeon, there was a terrifying suction force everywhere. It was much more terrifying than the suction force outside the tiny planet. Zhou Wen couldn’t move inside the hidden dungeon.</p>
<p>The jellyfish-like dimensional creature instantly appeared above the red avatar’s head. Countless tentacles wrapped around its head, making Zhou Wen feel as though his body was being sucked dry. He immediately summoned the Chaos Egg to protect himself before blocking the jellyfish’s attack.</p>
<p>The jellyfish constantly attacked the Chaos Egg. Although Zhou Wen couldn’t move, he realized something.</p>
<p>The jellyfish couldn’t move in the hidden dungeon either. All its actions were done through spatial teleportation, which meant that it was constantly instant transmitting.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen could continuously instant transmit, his body was constantly in a state of instant transmission like the jellyfish. As there was almost no gap between instant transmissions, it didn’t seem like he was instant transmitting.</p>
<p>It sounded difficult to understand. In fact, because the instant transmission interval was too short, the jellyfish Zhou Wen saw was actually just an afterimage. The real jellyfish had already undergone the next instant transmission by the time Zhou Wen saw it.</p>
<p>What amazing spatial ability. It’s only because dimensional creatures have special physiques that they can reach this stage. It’s impossible for a human’s body to withstand such continuous instant transmission. Zhou Wen attempted instant transmissions in the hidden dungeon. Indeed, as he had expected, he could use spatial powers to move in the hidden dungeon without being restricted.</p>
<p>The jellyfish’s spatial powers were very strong, but from Zhou Wen’s observations, it was likely only at the Human Realm. As its spatial powers were so powerful, it probably wouldn’t be easy for others to kill it. Even if someone at the Hell level came, they might not be able to gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>It wasn’t difficult for Zhou Wen to kill the jellyfish. The Teacher Domain could restrain the suction force of the hidden dungeon, and he was proficient in spatial powers. Killing the jellyfish was too easy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t do so because he wanted to learn the technique of constant instant transmissions from the jellyfish. He wanted to see if he could achieve such instant transmission with his human body.</p>
<p>If he could really do that, it would be very difficult for ordinary Calamity-grade creatures to injure him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally only fought the jellyfish with the intention of practicing, but to his surprise, something strange happened when the jellyfish instant transmitted onto the Chaos Egg</p>
<p>The Human Realm jellyfish didn’t have the ability to break through the Chaos Egg’s defense. It was the same this time. The jellyfish failed to damage the Chaos Egg at all.</p>
<p>Strangely, the Companion Beast armor Zhou Wen was wearing suddenly vanished. And in the jellyfish’s transparent hemispherical body, a mini armor Companion Beast appeared before quickly disappearing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was surprised to discover that his armor Companion Beast had been declared dead by the game system.</p>
<p>Isn’t this Eldest Senior Brother Liu Yun’s Star Stealer? This fellow actually knows it? Zhou Wen was first alarmed before he was delighted</p>
<p>He had always wanted to learn the Star Stealer skill, but no matter how many times he grinded in the endless cosmos, he failed to obtain the Star Stealer skill crystal. Now that this jellyfish actually had such a skill, he might be able to come up with a solution.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the jellyfish’s ability was clearly stronger than Liu Yun’s Star Stealer. Liu Yun probably couldn’t snatch a Companion Beast through the Chaos Egg either.</p>
<p>Having had no intention of immediately killing the jellyfish to begin with, the new idea Zhou Wen came up with made him even more unwilling to kill it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen attempted to analyze the jellyfish’s ability and soon realized that it was impossible for him to learn it.</p>
<p>This was because it wasn’t an ordinary Essence Energy Skill, but the jellyfish’s innate ability. Unless Zhou Wen transformed into a jellyfish, it was impossible for him to master</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Despite his great disappointment, Zhou Wen still used the jellyfish to practice for a period of time. When he was almost done with his spatial instant transmission technique, he was still inferior to the jellyfish. He could only slowly hone whatever was lacking in the future. He killed the jellyfish when fighting it no longer brought about any benefits.</p>
<p>A Zone Core dropped from the jellyfish’s body. It was this Zone Core that advanced the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>What surprised Zhou Wen even more was that the Zone Core was born from the jellyfish, so it contained the jellyfish’s talent ability. After the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art condensed a Calamity Zone, it had an ability similar to Star Stealer.</p>
<p>Of course, it was just an additional ability. The Calamity Zone’s ability wasn’t just that.</p>
<p>Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art: Universe Inversion (Human Realm)</p>
<p>Previously, the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art was best at long-distance teleportation. The Godfiend Era was the king of instant transmission at close range, but after advancing to the Calamity grade, the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art’s instant transmission ability had been greatly enhanced. It could almost be said to have reached Minute Subtlety.</p>
<p>In the past, Zhou Wen’s long-distance teleportation had been very inaccurate, but now, he could carry it out with precision at the millimeters level. It was much more accurate than satellite positioning.</p>
<p>Of course, this wasn’t the main ability of Universe Inversion. This was only the strengthening of the Calamity Zone’s Terror transformation. In fact, Zhou Wen still wasn’t too sure about the true ability of Universe Inversion.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was studying Universe Inversion, Karoman came knocking on his door. Zhou Wen hadn’t finished studying it.</p>
<p>From the results of the research, Universe Inversion could change some cosmic rules.</p>
<p>For example, gravity had a downward effect, and Universe Inversion could completely reverse the effects of gravity. When that happened, things on the ground would fly up by themselves.</p>
<p>It sounded unbelievable, but it wasn’t without reason. Zhou Wen understood it this way. It was like the two extremes of a magnet-like poles repel while unlike poles attract. Universe Inversion changed the unlike poles that were originally stuck together into like poles, so they naturally repelled each other.</p>
<p>This was only Zhou Wen’s current understanding. As his research on Universe Inversion wasn’t deep enough, Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if his understanding was wrong. He didn’t dare come to a conclusion.</p>
<p>It’s time to test the Universe Inversion’s ability to steal Companion Beasts. Zhou Wen looked at the Anasrava Gold Turtle armor and secretly circulated the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art.</p>
<p>According to Zhou Wen’s previous experiments, he had to come into contact with the other party’s Companion Beast to ‘steal’ it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1706'>Chapter 1706 Gold Turtle In Hand</h3>
<p>Pata’s flaunting of the Anasrava Gold Turtle in front of Zhou Wen was equivalent to delivering gifts to his doorstep. Regardless of whether the Anasrava Gold Turtle was one of the three Companion Beasts from Small Buddha Temple, Companion Beasts that had the ability to withstand taboo powers were extremely rare. There was no reason for him not to take it.</p>
<p>Pata clearly didn’t think so. Over the years, he had been traveling everywhere and had entered countless dangerous dimensional zones. The miraculous performance of the Anasrava Gold Turtle kept boosting his confidence. He was very certain that no one could control him as long as he wore the Anasrava Gold Turtle armor.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he had an instant transmission Companion Beast on him. He could instantly escape far away. With the help of the Anasrava Gold Turtle, Pata was completely confident that he could leave safely, so he was rather fearless.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen extend his palm and strike at him, Pata didn’t sense that his strength was affected by a taboo power at all. He imagined that Zhou Wen’s taboo power was indeed useless against him.</p>
<p>“I’ll let you see what an excellent-grade Companion Beast is.” Pata wasn’t in a rush to teleport away. He still wanted to show Zhou Wen and company how powerful the Anasrava Gold Turtle was.</p>
<p>From his point of view, even if Zhou Wen was at the Calamity grade, it was impossible for him to break through the defense of the Hell-level Anasrava Gold Turtle. Taking one step back, even if Zhou Wen could crack it, it was impossible for him to kill him with one strike.</p>
<p>Apart from Human Sovereign’s fantastic Companion Beast, Pata wasn’t afraid of anyone on Earth. Even if the powerful Karoman fought him, he would dare stand still and receive three punches from him.</p>
<p>Of course, the reason Pata did so was mainly because he hoped to let Zhou Wen understand how powerful the Anasrava Gold Turtle was, compelling him to make a deal with him. After all, the benefits he could obtain from lending a Companion Beast to Karoman were limited. 30% of Guide Ancient City’s future profits was a huge benefit that would be a constant stream of income.</p>
<p>“Come on, I’ll stand here and let you hit me. I’ll let you see what a true top-notch defensive Companion Beast is.” Pata straightened his back and stood proudly in his spot as though he thought nothing of him. He looked rather imposing. Zhou Wen slapped Pata, but it didn’t hurt at all. Pata was still feeling smug inwardly. Deceit King is nothing much after all. After all, he’s only an expert in the era without representatives. Compared to the present representatives, he’s still not strong enough. If not for the taboo power that can restrain Karoman, Guide Ancient City would have long been destroyed by him. Perfect. I’m the one reaping in all the profits. Is 30% of the profits too little? That’s right. You just slapped me. Now if you want my help, 30% isn’t enough to resolve the problem. At least 40%… No… 50%…</p>
<p>Pata was still fantasizing of how Zhou Wen and company pleaded with him in horror, hoping that he wouldn’t lend his Companion Beast to Karoman.</p>
<p>As he was thinking, Pata suddenly felt a chill run down his body. It was similar to being suddenly stripped naked and thrown into the snow in winter.</p>
<p>A little cold? Zhou Wen has ice-elemental power? This cold aura is useless against me… Just as Pata was thinking, he suddenly felt that something was amiss. He couldn’t sense the Anasrava Gold Turtle’s consciousness.</p>
<p>No… Impossible… Pata thought of a possibility, but he couldn’t accept it mentally. Or rather, he wasn’t willing to accept it at all.</p>
<p>Looking down at his body, he was alarmed to discover that the golden armor on his body had vanished, leaving only the clothes he usually wore.</p>
<p>Anasrava Gold Turtle… Where’s the Anasrava Gold Turtle… Pata couldn’t accept it at all. He summoned the Anasrava Gold Turtle repeatedly, but there was no reaction.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised because he had started with Universe Inversion to steal the Anasrava Gold Turtle over. However, to his surprise, the power of Universe Inversion didn’t take effect immediately.</p>
<p>It was unknown if it was because Universe Inversion was only at the Human Realm and couldn’t steal a Hell-level Companion Beast or if it was because the power of the Anasrava Gold Turtle was so crazy that it could even withstand the power of the Universe Inversion.</p>
<p>In the next second, Zhou Wen activated the Teacher Domain, hoping to figure out what kind of rules the Anasrava Gold Turtle used. To his surprise, the originally useless Universe Inversion under the Teacher Domain became effective and successfully stole the Anasrava Gold Turtle.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only slowly study the principle in the future.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s series of actions gave Pata time to fantasize. This was also how he experienced the two extremes of heaven and hell in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>“You… What did you do to me…” Pata looked at Zhou Wen with a look of horror. Up to now, he still wasn’t willing to believe that the Anasrava Gold Turtle was gone. He still hoped that the Anasrava Gold Turtle had been sealed by Zhou Wen using some taboo power.</p>
<p>It was no wonder Pata wasn’t willing to believe it. The reason he had his present achievements and status was basically because of the Anasrava Gold Turtle. Once he lost the Anasrava Gold Turtle, most of his strength would be gone. “After hearing you extol the virtues of the Anasrava Gold Turtle so much, I decided to take it for a spin.” Zhou Wen extended his hand and the Anasrava Gold Turtle appeared in front of him. Its golden body was motionless like a statue.</p>
<p>“Take it for a spin?” For a moment, Pata felt his brain lacking oxygen as it instantly went blank.</p>
<p>“You… You… You… Return the Anasrava Gold Turtle to me…” Pata was overwhelmed by anxiety and was momentarily at a loss for words. When he snapped to his senses, he hurriedly added,” Mr. Zhou, it’s all my fault. I was just joking with you. On account of Lance, please return the Anasrava Gold Turtle to me. I’ll leave immediately and guarantee that I won’t lend it to Karoman… No… Karoman is nothing… You aren’t even bothered by him… If you have any requests in the future, I’ll definitely be at your beck and call…”</p>
<p>Li Xuan nearly burst out laughing. “Didn’t you ask around about Zhou Wen’s nickname before you came? Do you think the nickname Deceit King was for nothing? Have you heard of a thief not leaving empty-handed? Besides, you came knocking on our door. Now, you want it back? Are you still dreaming?”</p>
<p>“On account of Lance and the Ultimate Family Clan, I’ll spare your life. Go,” Zhou Wen said casually. “I….” Pata didn’t give up. The Anasrava Gold Turtle was everything to him. He was about to go crazy.</p>
<p>“Why? Do you still want to leave your life here?” Li Xuan interrupted him coldly.</p>
<p>Pata’s heart chilled as he realized that without the protection of the Anasrava Gold Turtle, he wasn’t absolutely safe. If Zhou Wen and company really wanted to kill him, he might not have a chance of escaping.</p>
<p>Pata steeled his heart and flew away. No one stopped him, allowing him to successfully leave Guide Ancient City.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had indeed released him on account of Lance. Otherwise, how could he have let him walk out of Guide Ancient City alive?</p>
<p>After Pata left Guide Ancient City, his mind became adrift as though he was dreaming.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1707'>Chapter 1707 The Whereabouts of the Immortal Sword</h3>
<p>Just as he was in a daze, he suddenly heard his phone ring. He subconsciously took it out and answered the call.</p>
<p>“Pata, have you arrived? Where are you now? Quickly lend me the Anasrava Gold Turtle.” Karoman’s anxious voice sounded from the phone.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Karoman mention the Anasrava Gold Turtle, Pata felt even more stifled. He had suffered a huge blow just now and hadn’t recovered from it. Now, he was truly awake and his heart ached even more.</p>
<p>“Borrow my ass. Don’t come to me again if it’s anything related to Zhou Wen in the future,” cursed Pata as he hung up and switched off his phone.</p>
<p>Karoman was puzzled by the cursing and couldn’t figure out what was going on. He immediately called back, but he received the notification that the other party had switched off his phone.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Karoman wore an odd expression. Thinking back to Pata’s words, “Don’t come to me again if it’s anything related to Zhou Wen in the future,” he had a rough idea.</p>
<p>This fellow went to look for Zhou Wen? Furthermore, he suffered a loss? Karoman guessed a portion of it. Although it wasn’t all, he was already somewhat afraid.</p>
<p>Although Pata’s strength is a little lacking, he has the Anasrava Gold Turtle protecting him. He shouldn’t have suffered a loss, but from Pata’s tone, he seems to have suffered a huge loss. Could it be that the Anasrava Gold Turtle can’t withstand Zhou Wen’s taboo power? No matter how he thought about it, he never expected Pata’s Anasrava Gold Turtle to be taken away by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was rather comfortable at home as he looked at the Anasrava Gold Turtle’s stats.</p>
<p>Anasrava Gold Turtle: Calamity (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Anasrava Body</p>
<p>Life Soul: Immortality</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Immunity to All Dharma</p>
<p>Terror Form: Invulnerable Vajra Body (S-grade)</p>
<p>Calamity Zone: Invincible Without Me (Hell)</p>
<p>Strength: 200</p>
<p>Speed: 200</p>
<p>Constitution: 200</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 200</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Protection, Breaking Out, Exorcism, Eternal</p>
<p>Companion Form: Armor</p>
<p>It’s just advanced to the Hell level. The stats are still the most basic stats of the Hell level. Zhou Wen was greedy. He originally wondered if the Anasraya Gold Turtle’s stats had reached the peak of the Hell level.</p>
<p>It didn’t occur to him that ordinary people had no way of obtaining so many resources to feed a Calamity-grade Companion Beast. Pata had invested tons to be able to get the Anasrava Gold Turtle to the Hell level.</p>
<p>This was only because he had become a representative and had used most of the resources given by the dimensional races on the Anasrava Gold Turtle. Otherwise, it was a question whether the Anasrava Gold Turtle could advance to the Calamity grade by itself.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat curious if the Anasrava Gold Turtle could withstand the power of the Teacher Domain, so he summoned it to give it a try. He realized that this thing wasn’t afraid of the power of the Teacher Domain. Or rather, it wasn’t completely afraid.</p>
<p>The Teacher Domain could affect the Anasrava Gold Turtle, but it couldn’t completely seal it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t continue his research. The better the Anasrava Gold Turtle was, the more uncomfortable he felt. If it was really one of the three Companion Beasts of Small Buddha Temple, it would definitely be devoured by Truth Listener in the future. No matter how deep the research went, he couldn’t keep it. It would only make him feel worse. Let me see if it’s you. I hope not. Zhou Wen summoned Truth Listener to see if it would react to the Anasrava Gold Turtle.</p>
<p>Truth Listener’s golden eyes immediately lit up when it saw the Anasrava Gold Turtle. Before Zhou Wen could say a word, the earrings on its ears shattered by themselves and it quickly transformed into the golden ape. It went forward to bite the Anasrava Gold Turtle.</p>
<p>It really is one! Zhou Wen was somewhat helpless as he ordered the Anasrava Gold Turtle to not resist and let Truth Listener swallow it.</p>
<p>After swallowing the Anasrava Gold Turtle, Truth Listener automatically transformed into a tattoo and returned to Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen couldn’t summon it no matter how hard he tried.</p>
<p>This fellow is getting more and more willful. Did he follow Demonic Neonate’s bad example? Zhou Wen muttered as he began studying his next target to advance to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Now, the only Essence Energy Arts that hadn’t advanced to the Calamity grade were the Godfiend Era and the Demon God Catalog. Zhou Wen definitely wouldn’t go to Chess Mountain now. Even if he wanted to go, he had to wait for Truth Listener to finish its digestion.</p>
<p>The origins of the Godfiend Era are unknown. I don’t even know which pantheon’s Essence Energy Art it is. However, its stats are related to space. I’ll find a spatial dimensional zone to give it a try. Zhou Wen didn’t have any suitable dungeons on his phone. All he could do was flip through some information, hoping to find a suitable dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Immortal Crossing Jade Pavilion.</p>
<p>“Where’s the person I want?” A cold woman’s voice sounded from the jade building.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan sighed softly and said, “I’ve already handed the token to Zhou Wen. He didn’t come. Perhaps he has already made a decision or perhaps he hasn’t thought it through.” “This isn’t the answer I want.” The woman’s voice was emotionless. There was no joy, anger, sadness, or joy in it, but it made one feel reverence after hearing it, as though they were listening to the teachings of a god.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan wasn’t afraid as he said calmly, “He’s only my disciple, not my son. Even a son might not completely listen to me.”</p>
<p>oma</p>
<p>“If you can’t do it, what’s the point of keeping you?” the woman said indifferently as though she had Wang Mingyuan’s life pinched between her fingers.</p>
<p>“I know the whereabouts of that immortal sword.” Wang Mingyuan didn’t seem to care about life and death as he continued smiling.</p>
<p>“I hope what you say next can be exchanged for your life,” the woman said.</p>
<p>“The sword is at Kunlun Mountain,” Wang Mingyuan answered. “How do you know that the sword is at Kunlun Mountain?” The woman didn’t believe Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>“I saw it with my own eyes,” Wang Mingyuan answered calmly.</p>
<p>“Since you saw it, why didn’t you bring the sword back?” the woman asked again.</p>
<p>“I could see it, but I couldn’t get it.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“I’m no match for the dimensional creatures of Kunlun Mountain. There’s even a phoenix guarding the sword.” “What kind of phoenix?” the woman asked curiously.</p>
<p>Dragons were lascivious, resulting in many mixed-blood dragons, but phoenixes were pure creatures. Different types of phoenixes were unheard of.</p>
<p>“The Feng and Huang of a Phoenix,” Wang Mingyuan answered strangely.</p>
<p>However, the woman seemed to understand him. She said thoughtfully, “No wonder. It’s indeed beyond you.”</p>
<p>After a pause, the woman continued, “If you go to Kunlun Mountain again, will you be able to find the location of the sword?”</p>
<p>“If it’s only to take a look, I can lead the way at any time. I definitely won’t disappoint you, Immortal Supremacy,” Wang Mingyuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>The meaning behind his words was very clear. He could lead the way, but it was definitely impossible for him to retrieve the sword.</p>
<p>“You just need to lead the way. Someone will naturally retrieve the sword,” the woman said.</p>
<p>“I’m ready at your disposal, Immortal Supremacy,” Wang Mingyuan said.</p>
<p>“Stay here and listen to orders from the Immortals. Someone will inform you when the time comes.” The woman fell silent after saying that.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan bowed slightly before turning to leave the Immortal Crossing Jade Pavilion.</p>
<p>Inside the Immortal Crossing Jade Pavilion, an azure-robed woman frowned slightly as though she was thinking about something important.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1708'>Chapter 1708 The Legendary Kunlun Mountain</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen flipped through a lot of information. Although there weren’t many spatial dimensional zones, Guide Ancient City’s information sources were becoming more and more varied. The intelligence department was constantly improving, allowing Zhou Wen to gain knowledge of more spatial dimensional zones.</p>
<p>However, after looking around, he wasn’t sure which one was more compatible with the Godfiend Era.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was considering which spatial dimensional zone to visit, Liu Yun suddenly called. “Junior Brother, it’s been a long time since we last met. Do you miss your dear Eldest Senior Brother?” Liu Yun was still as greasy as ever.</p>
<p>“I miss the treasures on you more,” Zhou Wen subconsciously replied.</p>
<p>Every time he met Liu Yun, Zhou Wen seemed to be able to get some good things from him. For a long period of time, Zhou Wen treated Liu Yun as a treasure delivery boy. His words were truly heartfelt.</p>
<p>When Liu Yun heard that, he said in an extremely ambiguous and exaggerated tone, “Junior Brother, I never expected you to be such a person. Although I do have a big tool and great skill, I’m really not interested in</p>
<p>men!”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was taken aback before he reacted. “Speak your mind. If there’s nothing else, I’m hanging up.” “Don’t be so petty. Can’t you take a joke? I have something serious to discuss with you,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“I’m busy. I’ll hang up if there’s nothing else.” Zhou Wen didn’t really hang up. “I discovered something good in a dimensional zone. Are you interested in joining me?” Liu Yun hurriedly said.</p>
<p>“You’ll come to me if there’s something good? Speak. What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen didn’t believe that Liu Yun would share good things with him out of goodwill.</p>
<p>“Hehe, nothing much. It’s just that I can’t deal with that dimensional zone myself. If you are interested, let’s give it a try together. I won’t take advantage of you either. Everything we obtain will be split 50-50,” Liu Yun said with a grin.</p>
<p>“What dimensional zone? What good things are inside? What’s the thing you can’t handle? Tell me everything in detail. If… I mean if… I agree to go with you and discover something different, don’t blame me for turning hostile.” Zhou Wen knew Liu Yun too well. Although this fellow couldn’t be considered bad, he was definitely not a good person. He could at most believe 70% of what he said.</p>
<p>“Have you heard of Kunlun Mountain?” Liu Yun’s tone became much more serious.</p>
<p>“Which Kunlun Mountain are you talking about?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Smart. It’s definitely not the one on the map,” said Liu Yun with a smile.</p>
<p>“You found the legendary Kunlun Mountain?” Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed. The Kunlun Mountain on maps was different from the legendary Kunlun Mountain. Kunlun Mountain was also known as the Kunlun Ruins. There were many legendary versions.</p>
<p>Some said that Kunlun Mountain was mainly led by the Queen Mother of the West, while others said that it was the capital of Human Sovereign, Fuxi. Others said that it was the home of the gods.</p>
<p>Although there were many versions of the legends, it was impossible to tell which was real and which was fake. However, in all the versions of the myths and legends, that place was a top-notch land of immortals. Those who could be related to Kunlun Mountain were basically the super immortals of the eastern pantheon.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s been found and something good has been discovered, but I can’t retrieve it myself. There’s still hope if we join forces,” Liu Yun said sincerely.</p>
<p>“If it’s really the legendary Kunlun Mountain, do you think I can pick up the spoils so easily from that place?” After Zhou Wen saw how terrifying Chess Mountain was, he didn’t dare rashly enter the unknown top dimensional zones.</p>
<p>Although the Mythical creatures in Chess Mountain were terrifying, they seemed to be inferior to Mount Kunlun.</p>
<p>“I’ve already made a trip inside. Ain’t I back safely? Don’t worry. I’ve already investigated and have a plan. I’m just lacking you as a helper. Are you coming?” Liu Yun said with confidence.</p>
<p>“Tell me. What do you want to do?” Although Zhou Wen was already tempted, he wouldn’t agree to Liu Yun so easily before figuring out the actual situation.</p>
<p>“I’ll be honest with you. I discovered a sword in Kunlun Mountain-a very powerful sword. You are very familiar with Human Sovereign’s sword. That sword is definitely not inferior to Human Sovereign’s. However, there’s a powerful dimensional creature guarding the sword. I can’t deal with it myself, so I came to you for help,” Liu Yun said.</p>
<p>“How do you know that the sword isn’t inferior to Human Sovereign’s sword?” Zhou Wen knew that Liu Yun was implying that he was Human Sovereign, but he pretended not to understand.</p>
<p>“Because that sword is very similar to Human Sovereign’s sword. I reckon it’s very likely related to Human Sovereign’s sword.” Liu Yun hesitated for a moment before continuing, “I suspect that Human Sovereign’s sword might be one of the legendary Four Swords of Immortal Vanquishing. And the one I discovered at Kunlun Mountain might be one of them.”</p>
<p>“One of the four Immortal Vanquishing Swords?” Zhou Wen’s interest was truly piqued, but he still had to make things clear. “What’s the level of the dimensional creature guarding the sword?”</p>
<p>“It might be the Heaven Realm,” Liu Yun answered hesitantly.</p>
<p>“What do you mean it might be the Heaven Realm?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“Because I’m not sure either. It’s just a guess. This is the truth. Do you think I can fight such a dimensional creature? If I really attack, even if I can come out alive, I probably won’t have the strength to talk to you,” Liu Yun said helplessly.</p>
<p>“That’s true.” Zhou Wen pondered for a moment and said after some thought, “I can agree to go with you to take a look, but I’ll decide if I’ll participate in the operation. I’ll decide after I get there. If you agree, I’ll go with you. If not, just pretend I’ve never heard of it.”</p>
<p>“Sure. I’ll send you the coordinates. You can teleport over. We’ll meet there.” After Liu Yun said that, he hung up and sent Zhou Wen the coordinates.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me this fellow wants to scam me again? Zhou Wen didn’t dare teleport over casually. He held the coordinates and compared them to the map to see where the coordinates Liu Yun had given him were.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also wanted to know where the legendary Kunlun Mountain was.</p>
<p>Of course, he had another goal for going there. He wanted to see if he could find the tiny palm symbol and download the Kunlun Mountain dungeon into his phone.</p>
<p>Why is it here? Zhou Wen looked at the coordinates on the map and couldn’t help but be surprised.</p>
<p>He originally imagined that the legendary Kunlun Mountain wasn’t where the present Kunlun Mountain was. It was likely a relatively remote area, but the location indicated by the coordinates wasn’t too far from where Zhou Wen was. It was a small county city named Yang City County. After checking some information on the Internet and knowing that Yang City County hadn’t fallen and that there were still people living there, Zhou Wen felt relieved. He planned on teleporting over to meet Liu Yun and see what the legendary Kunlun Mountain looked like.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1709'>Chapter 1709 Nine Gates</h3>
<p>Yang City County had a population of hundreds of thousands before the dimensional storm. Now, the number of people living in the city was less than 50,000. This was only because there weren’t many dimensional zones near Yang City County, and it was rare for break-out creatures to appear.</p>
<p>There were a few dimensional zones in Yang City County, but they weren’t very famous. He had never heard of them causing much of a stir. Before Zhou Wen came, he had read some information about Yang City County and guessed that if Kunlun Mountain was nearby, the most likely place would be the mountain known as Xicheng Mountain.</p>
<p>Legend had it that Xicheng Mountain was a place where the King of Shang prayed for rain. The locals also called it Holy King Square. As the surrounding cliffs were like a city and the middle was sunken like a basin, it was given this name due to it having four entrances in the north, south, east, and west.</p>
<p>The mountain was the typical Karst geographical terrain. There were limestone caves of all sizes on the mountain. There was a local saying that there were 72 single dragon nests, 124 ghost millstones, and 360 small metal pots. It was said that the huge limestone caves here could accommodate more than ten thousand people. However, ever since the dimensional storms, Xicheng Mountain became even more complicated. People who entered had a high chance of getting lost. Furthermore, no one saw any dimensional creatures inside.</p>
<p>There were too many dimensional zones that didn’t produce dimensional creatures with unknown secrets. Few people would take the initiative to explore them.</p>
<p>The reason Zhou Wen suspected that this was the Kunlun Mountain that Liu Yun had mentioned was that in the information he had found online, someone had indeed said that this was the legendary Kunlun Mountain of ancient times.</p>
<p>However, this saying was a localized rumor. Not many people knew about it. Zhou Wen had only seen it after searching the Internet. He had no idea that such a saying existed in the past.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, you look radiant. You’ve been doing pretty well recently.” Just as Zhou Wen was sizing up Yang City County, Liu Yun crawled out of nowhere and grinned.</p>
<p>“You don’t seem to be doing well.” Zhou Wen looked at Liu Yun and realized that this fellow hadn’t advanced to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing I can do about it. The old fellow doesn’t let me go into the dimension. I can only rely on myself. I don’t know when I can advance to the Calamity grade. In my opinion, it’s a waste not to take the dimension’s resources. It’s great not to work after receiving the benefits,” Liu Yun grumbled.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that the old fellow Liu Yun mentioned was Jing Daoxian. Liu Yun was apparently Jing Daoxian’s grandson. Zhou Wen wasn’t too sure if it was true.</p>
<p>What’s the situation now? Although Zhou Wen was curious about what Jing Daoxian had been up to, he knew that it was useless to ask, so he decided not to bother.</p>
<p>“You didn’t bring that chick over?” Liu Yun sized up Zhou Wen for a while before suddenly asking “Why should I bring it here?” Zhou Wen frowned. For Liu Yun to mention Chick, he clearly had some plans.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you? There’s a phoenix in Mount Kunlun. That chick of yours should be a phoenix, right? If you bring it over, you might be able to get them to recognize each other as family. We might be able to get the sword without fighting,” said Liu Yun. “When did you tell me that there’s a phoenix on Kunlun Mountain?” Zhou Wen glared at him and continued, “Furthermore, not all phoenixes are relatives. How can there be such a good thing?” Zhou Wen didn’t bring Chick to a place like Kunlun Mountain on adventures. It was better to wait for Chick to advance to the Heaven Realm. /</p>
<p>“I’m just saying. Let’s take a look at the situation first. If you are confident, we’ll carry out the heist. If you aren’t confident, we’ll retreat and discuss it further.” As Liu Yun spoke, he turned around and headed for the mountain.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me the Kunlun Mountain you’re talking about is the Xicheng Mountain?” Zhou Wen asked as he walked.</p>
<p>“That’s right. It’s not an easy path. Only I, the number one thief in the world, can take people in and out freely. If it were anyone else, even the immortals in heaven probably wouldn’t be able to come out.” Liu Yun was smug as though he was speaking the truth.</p>
<p>“You haven’t improved much after all this time, but your bragging skills are getting better,” Zhou Wen quipped.</p>
<p>“I’m really not bragging this time. What kind of place is the legendary Kunlun Mountain? The home of all immortals. To put it bluntly, ordinary immortals are just ordinary villagers at Kunlun Mountain…” The two of them chatted as they walked and soon arrived in front of the mountain.</p>
<p>Xicheng Mountain wasn’t very steep. The mountain peaks formed a circle like slumbering tigers. It looked like a mountain city.</p>
<p>“There are four gates on Xicheng Mountain. They are also the four entrances to the dimensional zone. However, if you really enter through these four gates, you can forget about seeing what the real Xicheng Mountain looks like.” Liu Yun led Zhou Wen to the other side without walking towards the nearest entrance.</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>“There are four on the surface and five hidden entrances. In fact, Xicheng Mountain has a total of nine gates. Doesn’t the Classic of Mountains and Seas say that Kunlun is 800 leagues long and 10,000 fathoms high. Towering above is a tree that’s 30 meters tall and five-people wide. It’s a place in which a giant stalk of grain is growing, nine wells that are enclosed in jade thresholds, and where the nine city gates are guarded by animals called Kaiming. If Xicheng Mountain is really Kunlun Mountain, there naturally has to be nine gates,” Liu Yun answered. “What do you mean by ‘if?’” Zhou Wen frowned slightly.</p>
<p>“It’s just a guess. Although my guess is most likely correct, aren’t there always what-ifs? I’m precise with my words. I can’t guarantee something I’m not sure about,” Liu Yun spouted nonsense.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, Liu Yun stopped by a pool near a mountain wall. He pointed at the pool and said, “We’re here. This is one of the nine gates of Kunlun Mountain. Only by using this entrance can we see what the real Kunlun Mountain looks like.”</p>
<p>“There’s no rush. Let’s walk around first. Didn’t you say that there are a total of nine gates? Take me to all nine gates.” Zhou Wen sized up the pool and didn’t see the tiny palm symbol nearby.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t really care if he could enter Kunlun Mountain, but he had to find the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>“Apart from the four gates-north, south, east, and west-I only know of one. The other gates are hidden. I won’t be able to find them anytime soon. Besides, what’s so nice about those gates? Isn’t entry all that matters?” Liu Yun seemed a little anxious when he saw Zhou Wen turn around and leave.</p>
<p>“Why are you so anxious?” Zhou Wen turned around and sized up Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“Am I?” Liu Yun laughed, trying to brush the matter of.</p>
<p>“You’re getting anxious.” Zhou Wen nodded seriously. He felt that something was amiss with Liu Yun. He was definitely hiding something from him. “Sigh, I’m just anxious to obtain the sword as soon as possible. Look at how impressive Human Sovereign is. If I have that sword, my future achievements will definitely not be inferior to Human Sovereign. I might even be able to obtain the title of Stealer Sovereign… Hey… Don’t leave…” Liu Yun hurriedly chased after Zhou Wen when he saw him turn around to leave.</p>
<p>As the two of them were wandering around the vicinity of the mountain, an azure-robed woman was walking towards it. She was clearly dressed in a very ordinary outfit and didn’t look eye-catching, but upon careful inspection, nobody could see what she looked like. Even her figure was indescribable.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1710'>Chapter 1710 Is It A Trap?</h3>
<p>“Kunlun?” The woman stood in front of the north gate of Xicheng Mountain, staring at the strange mountain terrain as though she was thinking about something.</p>
<p>“Immortal Supremacy, do you really want to enter the mountain personally?” Wang Mingyuan, who was dressed in white, stood not far behind the woman and spoke respectfully. “Can’t I enter Kunlun?” the woman said indifferently. “Immortal Supremacy, you can go anywhere regardless of how big the world is. However, Earth hasn’t been completely breached yet, so it’s a little inconvenient. Immortal Supremacy, why do you have to enter the mountain personally? It will be fine getting a subordinate to enter the mountain with me to scout the situation,” Wang Mingyuan said.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to say it so tactfully. Even though I’m restricted to a certain extent on Earth”—the woman said with an indifferent expression-“so what? Ignoring the mere restriction, even if I can’t use any strength, there’s nothing on Earth that can harm me at</p>
<p>all.”</p>
<p>“You’re right, Immortal Supremacy.” Wang Mingyuan didn’t say anything else. “Why must we enter through the north gate?” the woman asked as she looked at the mountain entrance.</p>
<p>“Out of the nine gates of Kunlun, there are only the east, west, south, and north gates that remain unhidden. The other five gates are hidden. I only know three of the five hidden gates. The things I see when I enter Kunlun Mountain from those three gates are completely different. Entering Kunlun through the four gates results in being at different locations, but it’s only a difference in location. The things seen are the same.” Wang Mingyuan paused before continuing, “The sword I saw can only be seen by entering the four unhidden gates.” “Since the things seen from entering the four unhidden gates are the same, why don’t we enter through the other three gates? Why must we enter through the north gate?” the woman asked again.</p>
<p>“There’s a Mountain God Temple outside the other three gates. It’s difficult to hide our whereabouts when entering the mountain from there. The mountain is already aware, so it’s not convenient for us to do anything,” Wang Mingyuan said.</p>
<p>“Then let’s enter through the north gate.” The woman glanced at Wang Mingyuan and nodded slightly. “I’ll lead the way,” Wang Mingyuan said as he walked towards the mountain entrance.</p>
<p>The woman followed behind Wang Mingyuan unhurriedly and they entered the mountain entrance one after another.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, stop walking about. Let’s enter the mountain quickly.” Liu Yun followed Zhou Wen and kept persuading him to enter the mountain quickly. “There’s no rush. Let’s walk around first.” Zhou Wen was certain that Liu Yun was hiding something from him. Furthermore, it was something very important. Otherwise, with Liu Yun’s personality, he wouldn’t be in such a rush.</p>
<p>Even if he was anxious, he wouldn’t reveal such a look.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you the truth. I’m not the only one who knows that the sword is in Kunlun Mountain. I’m really afraid that someone else will beat us to it. Stop walking around. Let’s go in quickly.” Liu Yun knew that if he didn’t say anything, it would be impossible for him to pull Zhou Wen into the mountain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Liu Yun and didn’t say a word. Liu Yun said anxiously, “Don’t look at me like that. I swear that everything I said was the truth. If there’s a single false word, it will make my lower body impotent for the rest of my life.”</p>
<p>“You actually dared to make such a venomous oath. From the looks of it, you aren’t lying to me,” Zhou Wen said with a nod.</p>
<p>“Then let’s go, quickly. Time waits for no one. We have to get the sword out before the others,” Liu Yun said anxiously. “I said that I believe you, but I didn’t say that I’ll enter the mountain now. I’ll walk around first,” Zhou Wen said as he continued walking forward, ignoring whether Liu Yun followed.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, don’t you realize what’s happening now? Don’t throw a tantrum. If that sword is snatched by someone else, won’t that suck for us? When the time comes, it would be too late for regret,” Liu Yun said gloomily.</p>
<p>“Then tell me. Who will beat us to it?” Zhou Wen had no intention of turning back as he continued walking forward.</p>
<p>“About that…” Liu Yun was stunned.</p>
<p>“You weren’t the one who discovered the sword in Kunlun Mountain,” Zhou Wen suddenly said. “How did you know?” Liu Yun was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>“You are good at stealing, and there’s nothing in such a place that you can steal. Without knowing what’s inside, you definitely won’t go in for a stroll,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Alright, I admit that I didn’t discover it.” Liu Yun knew that he couldn’t fool Zhou Wen, so he didn’t deny it.</p>
<p>“Jing Daoxian discovered it?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>The only person who could find such a strange place was probably that strange old man. “You guessed wrongly this time. This place wasn’t found by the old fellow first.” Liu Yun’s answer exceeded Zhou Wen’s expectations.</p>
<p>“Who is it?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>“I can tell you, but you have to promise me that you will immediately follow me into the mountain when you know the answer,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“Then it’s best I don’t know.” Zhou Wen continued walking forward.</p>
<p>Liu Yun burned with anxiety as he said helplessly, “It’s our human traitor teacher who discovered it. He also made a deal with the old fellow and got me to get you to retrieve the sword. However, he told me not to tell you</p>
<p>yet.”</p>
<p>“Human traitor?” Zhou Wen was taken aback before he realized what Liu Yun meant.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t he tell me himself?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. He only told the old fellow that the Immortals are very interested in that sword. We have to take it before the Immortals do. We might be too late if we delay our entry. It’s best if you quickly enter the mountain with me,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t make sense.” Zhou Wen had no intention of turning back.</p>
<p>“What do you mean it doesn’t make sense? What I said was true. If I lie to you, I’ll let you remove my head and use it as a toilet.” Liu Yun was really anxious.</p>
<p>“I mean, this entire matter doesn’t make sense.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and continued, “Teacher discovered this place first, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.” Liu Yun nodded.</p>
<p>“Since he was the one who discovered it first, he could have informed me earlier even if it wasn’t convenient for him to retrieve the sword. Why did he have to wait until the Immortals are about to arrive before getting you to take me to retrieve the sword?” Zhou Wen pondered. “Perhaps he can’t do so in the dimension because of the situation and he didn’t have the chance to inform you,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“If it’s really that urgent, why would he take such a huge detour? He even wants you to take me there and not tell me the news directly?” Zhou Wen turned around and said to Liu Yun, “After your grandfather received the news, he probably spent quite some time understanding the situation inside, right?”</p>
<p>“You know that too?” Liu Yun looked at Zhou Wen in surprise.</p>
<p>“With that old man’s personality, how can he easily trust others? Furthermore, he’s risking his grandson’s life. If he doesn’t figure out the situation inside, how can he let you take me in?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Now that you mention it, it does seem to be the case,” Liu Yun said gloomily. “Are you telling me that Teacher wants to scam us?” “I don’t think he will scam us. Perhaps he’s just using us as two chess pieces,” Zhou Wen said distractedly. His gaze and attention were attracted by the scenery ahead.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1711'>Chapter 1711 The Gate Found by Accident</h3>
<p>After circling around Xicheng Mountain for so long, Zhou Wen finally saw the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>However, there was no entrance to the mountain at the spot where the tiny palm symbol was. There was a bare stone wall with a fist-sized depression on it. As the nearby mountain walls weren’t flat, the depression looked inconspicuous.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, are you really not planning on entering the mountain? I think that although Teacher is a little strange, he wouldn’t scam us. Furthermore, the old fellow has already gone in to take a look. You know how sharp his eyes are. If he says that there’s no problem, I don’t think there will be a problem,” Liu Yun muttered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored him. He took out his phone and snapped the tiny palm symbol on the mountain wall with his back facing Liu Yun. His phone immediately displayed the download notification of the dungeon. “What’s so good about snapping this crappy mountain? Say something. Do you want to enter the mountain or not?” Liu Yun was extremely depressed. “Don’t you think this mountain wall is a little different?” Zhou Wen said as he looked at the mountain wall.</p>
<p>If not for the tiny palm symbol, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have discovered anything amiss here. However, since the tiny palm symbol was engraved here, it didn’t make sense that there was nothing special around the mountain wall.</p>
<p>Therefore, after repeated observations, Zhou Wen realized that the mountain wall was somewhat special.</p>
<p>“What’s different?” Liu Yun was taken aback when he heard that. He couldn’t help but carefully size up the mountain wall. “The protrusions and depressions on this mountain wall are somewhat strange,” Zhou Wen said as he looked.</p>
<p>“What’s so strange about it? Why don’t I see any differences? The terrain here is just like that. It’s all natural. There aren’t any signs of artificial excavation.” Liu Yun was a little puzzled. He couldn’t tell what was wrong.</p>
<p>“If I’m not wrong, the protrusions and depressions here are arranged in a profound formation. They look irregular, but they contain great wisdom.” Ever since Zhou Wen watched the battle between Truth Listener and Starlady Polestar, he had a deeper understanding of the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array. He knew a little about such stuff.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t know what the arrangement of the protrusions and depressions was called, some of them were very similar to the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array. It wasn’t difficult to make an analogy.</p>
<p>“You know array formations?” Liu Yun looked at Zhou Wen in surprise.</p>
<p>“A little. Let me see. If I’m not wrong, there should be something else here,” Zhou Wen said as he reached out and pressed down on one of the protrusions.</p>
<p>However, nothing happened. He didn’t manage to sink the protruding stone, nor did anything happen nearby.</p>
<p>“Haha, Junior Brother, there’s no need to blush. It’s normal for humans to make mistakes. Don’t show off if you haven’t learned it well in the future…” He was very happy that he had finally found an opportunity to criticize Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored him and pressed a few other protrusions and depressions.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, array formations come from the Book of Changes. It’s a form of specialized knowledge. It’s not something that can be learned simply by browsing through. If you really want to learn it, I’ll recommend you to the Zhang family later. Their family is good at this…” Liu Yun was speaking happily when the smile on his face suddenly froze. After Zhou Wen finished tapping, he heard cracking sounds as a fissure suddenly opened in the mountain wall.</p>
<p>The hole wasn’t big, only slightly bigger than a dog hole. People could probably only crawl inside; it was impossible for ordinary people to stand up.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, there really is one. Could this be one of the nine gates of Kunlun? However, this entrance is too small. It’s very difficult for humans to enter. Can those creatures in Kunlun Mountain burrow out?” Liu Yun widened his eyes.</p>
<p>“I wonder if we can reach the place you mentioned by entering from here,” Zhou Wen said as he sized up the hole.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid no one knows about this mountain entrance. Who knows what will happen if we enter from here. Let’s not waste any time. If you want to enter, go through the gate I mentioned.” Liu Yun didn’t wish to take the risk. Kunlun Mountain wasn’t a place where one could take risks.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t plan on entering either. Like Liu Yun, he wasn’t willing to risk his life.</p>
<p>Since the mobile dungeon was already downloading, he could slowly explore it in-game in the future.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly heard a strange sound coming from the hole, as though something was rubbing two stones together.</p>
<p>What’s that sound? Zhou Wen sized up the cave entrance. It didn’t seem to be obstructed, but he could only see a meter or two. When he looked further in, he couldn’t see anything. All he felt was darkness.</p>
<p>Darkness wasn’t an obstacle to Zhou Wen’s vision. He could see everything clearly even if it was pitch black. It wasn’t as simple as being dark.</p>
<p>“It sounds like someone’s using sandpaper to grind rocks.” Liu Yun listened for a while before continuing, “That sound seems to be getting closer and closer to the hole. Could something be coming out?”</p>
<p>“What could it be? A break-out creature?” Zhou Wen was somewhat curious. After retreating and waiting for a period of time, he continued staring intently at the hole.</p>
<p>Liu Yun retreated even further than Zhou Wen. If something really came out of Kunlun Mountain, it would definitely be an extremely terrifying object.</p>
<p>The stronger the dimensional zones were, the harder it was for the dimensional creatures inside to break out. The thought of creatures that could break out of the Kunlun Mountain struck fear in him.</p>
<p>The grinding sounds coming from the cave grew louder and louder. Zhou Wen thought for a long time, but he couldn’t figure out what the sound was. He had never seen an animal make such a sound when crawling out.</p>
<p>No matter how hard he listened, it sounded like someone was grinding rocks. Not long after, the sound of grinding became even more intense. This time, it didn’t sound like it was grinding rocks. It sounded more like someone was cutting rocks.</p>
<p>The thin and sharp sound hurt one’s eardrums.</p>
<p>“From the commotion, I reckon a huge fellow is about to come out. Let’s not cause trouble. Quickly close the gate.” Liu Yun retreated a distance. If there was so much of a stir, he would probably be the first to escape.</p>
<p>“Since it’s coming out, it won’t be too late to leave after seeing what it is,” Zhou Wen said as he retreated. The two of them hid behind a boulder in the distance and secretly looked in the direction of the cave entrance. Now, he was really curious about what would crawl out.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, do you think an electric saw will crawl out?” Liu Yun looked nervous, but he didn’t stop talking.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, he saw a blurry shadow appear in the cave, but he couldn’t clearly make it out. The thing in the cave seemed to have walked out of the thick fog. At first, he could only see its outline, but as he got closer and closer to the cave entrance, its appearance gradually became clearer.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” Finally, Zhou Wen and Liu Yun saw what the thing that crawled out of the cave looked like, but they still didn’t recognize it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1712'>Chapter 1712 Treasure</h3>
<p>“What’s that?” Liu Yun looked at the thing that came out of the cave with a look of surprise.</p>
<p>“How would I know what it is!” Zhou Wen couldn’t tell what it was either.</p>
<p>The thing that came out of the cave didn’t look like a living creature. From the exposed parts outside the cave, it looked like a metal container.</p>
<p>As only a portion of it was exposed, its entire body couldn’t be seen. It looked like a metal container with four sides. There were many strange and mysterious patterns engraved on it, making it look ancient.</p>
<p>The metal container was still squeezing out because it was slightly bigger than the cave. With every movement, the metal outer wall emitted an ear-piercing screech as it rubbed against the mountain wall. It was the sound Zhou Wen and Liu Yun had heard previously.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen and Liu Yun were hiding in the distance and watching, a metal container dropped out of the cave and landed on the ground. Indeed, it was a metal container that was about the height of a person. It was wide at the top and narrow at the bottom. The bottom was squarish, and it was impossible to tell what it was.</p>
<p>The two of them exchanged looks and neither of them dared to show themselves. They hid in the distance and watched for a while. The thing remained motionless as though it was dead.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the metal container fell out, nothing else came out of the cave.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, you are the knowledgeable one. Why don’t you take a look at it and see what it is?” Liu Yun wanted to know what it was, but he didn’t dare take a gander for himself. He encouraged Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Such matters should be left to senior brothers.” Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to take the risk. His feet didn’t move at all as though he had rooted himself to the ground.</p>
<p>The two of them looked at each other. No one dared to really go over.</p>
<p>Time ticked by. The two of them waited for more than half an hour, but there was no movement from the metal artifact.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s curiosity was greater than Zhou Wen’s. Finally, he couldn’t help but summon a Companion Beast that resembled a cat or a ferret. He controlled the Companion Beast and made it carefully approach the metal artifact.</p>
<p>The two of them stared at the Companion Beast and metal container until the Companion Beast crawled to its side. However, the thing remained motionless.</p>
<p>“Crawl in and see what’s inside.” Zhou Wen observed for a while. The middle of the metal container was empty. It was a square basin, but he couldn’t see what was inside. He had used several vision techniques, but all he saw was chaotic noise. He couldn’t see what was inside.</p>
<p>Liu Yun naturally wouldn’t take the risk with his main Companion Beasts. The Companion Beast he had summoned was only an ordinary Epic Companion Beast. Even if it died, he wouldn’t feel the pinch. He immediately stopped arguing with Zhou Wen and ordered the Companion Beast to jump up.</p>
<p>Seeing the Companion Beast standing on the metal container while nothing happened, Liu Yun ordered it to drill in again.</p>
<p>The moment the Companion Beast entered, the metal container immediately reacted. It trembled as though it had been electrocuted. A strange light was swirling inside.</p>
<p>After a moment, before the two of them could figure out anything, the metal container stopped trembling and returned to its original motionless state.</p>
<p>“Is it dead?” Zhou Wen couldn’t see the situation inside the metal container, so he could only ask Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Liu Yun wore an odd expression and didn’t answer Zhou Wen’s question. He stared intently at the metal container. Soon, Liu Yun’s Companion Beast crawled out of the metal container. However, the Companion Beast that crawled out was clearly bigger. Its originally pale yellow fur was even more resplendent with golden light, like a golden-furred beast.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately widened his eyes when he saw it. With his present abilities, even if he didn’t know what kind of Companion Beast it was, he could roughly tell its level.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast that Liu Yun had summoned was clearly at the Epic stage, but after crawling out, it had reached the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>The two of them immediately realized that the metal container seemed to be an amazing treasure.</p>
<p>“Is your Companion Beast an evolvable type?” Zhou Wen asked Liu Yun.</p>
<p>If it was an evolvable Companion Beast, it wouldn’t be difficult for it to advance from the Epic stage to the Mythical stage due to the help of some powerful treasure.</p>
<p>However, if a non-evolving Companion Beast could advance to the Mythical stage inside the metal container, that would be amazing.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s an evolvable Companion Beast. From the looks of it, there’s quite a lot of energy inside. It actually advanced to the Mythical stage so quickly,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>As Liu Yun spoke, he suddenly instant transmitted to the metal container and reached out to grab it.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, Zhou Wen appeared on the other side of the metal container and grabbed it with one hand. He knew Liu Yun too well. From Liu Yun’s words, he knew that he was definitely lying. The Companion Beast he had summoned was most likely an unevolvable Epic.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s actions proved this point. Zhou Wen grabbed the edge of the metal container and tried his best to snatch it.</p>
<p>To be able to advance an ordinary Companion Beast to the Mythical stage, this thing was practically a divine artifact.</p>
<p>If ordinary Companion Beasts could advance to the Mythical stage after staying inside for a moment, what changes would a true high-level Companion Beast undergo inside? Just the thought of it was thrilling.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was only at the Terror grade and his strength was far inferior to Zhou Wen’s. Although the two of them grabbed the edge of the metal container, Zhou Wen was strong enough to pull it towards him. Just as Zhou Wen thought he was about to succeed, Liu Yun twisted the palm holding the metal container, making it suddenly vanish. Zhou Wen felt air in his grasp.</p>
<p>“Haha, Junior Brother, I’m not as good at fighting as you are, but you’re still wanting when it comes to stealing. Besides, I gave you a chance just now. You didn’t do it yourself. Now that I have it, you can’t take it from me.” Liu Yun took two steps back and looked at Zhou Wen with a smug look. Clearly, he had transferred the metal container somewhere.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a little regretful. If he had known, he would have used Universe Inversion first to get the metal container in his position.</p>
<p>But it was already too late. Even if Zhou Wen wanted to use the Universe Inversion, it was useless if he couldn’t find the metal container.</p>
<p>“Congratulations on obtaining the treasure, Eldest Senior Brother. It’s best if you take a closer look. That thing might not be able to be used by you.” However, Zhou Wen wasn’t the kind of person who believed that all the treasures in the world should belong to him. Since Liu Yun had snatched the treasure from him due to his carelessness, he didn’t plan on vying for it.</p>
<p>“Haha, I know the feeling of sour grapes. Don’t worry, I’ll examine it carefully, but don’t even think about touching it.” Liu Yun instant transmitted far away before waving his hand again, producing the metal container out of thin air.</p>
<p>As he guarded against Zhou Wen, he carefully observed the metal artifact. Soon, he summoned an Epic Companion Beast and threw it in.</p>
<p>A magical scene happened again. The metal artifact trembled as the Epic Companion Beast that Liu Yun had thrown in advanced to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>“Haha, I’m finally rich.” Liu Yun laughed out loud, almost jumping with joy.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1713'>Chapter 1713 Golden Elixir Pills?</h3>
<p>“It’s indeed not bad to be able to advance ordinary Companion Beasts to Mythical Companion Beasts.” Zhou Wen implied that Mythical Companion Beasts were no longer of much use at their level.</p>
<p>“How do you know that this thing can only advance Companion Beasts to the Mythical stage?” Liu Yun wasn’t convinced. He summoned a Terror-grade Companion Beast and let it enter the metal container.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t believe that this thing could evolve a Terror-grade Companion Beast into a Calamity. In that case, a Calamity would have been too pedestrian.</p>
<p>The metal container trembled again, but even when it stopped trembling, Liu Yun’s Companion Beast didn’t come out.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Don’t tell me the Companion Beast was devoured by the metal container?” Zhou Wen looked at Liu Yun in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s expression was somewhat alarmed before it turned from shock to pleasant surprise. Then, he laughed out loud.</p>
<p>“Could this fellow have gone mad from anger?” Zhou Wen said with a slight frown.</p>
<p>“You’re the one who’s crazy,” Liu Yun said excitedly as he summoned his Companion Beast out of the metal container. The Companion Beast had really advanced from the Terror grade to the Calamity grade. “No way? It really advanced to the Calamity grade!” Zhou Wen was somewhat taken aback.</p>
<p>“That’s not all. Look at this.” Liu Yun was so happy that he started becoming incoherent. He reached into the metal container.</p>
<p>Soon, Liu Yun pulled out his hand again. He held something in his palm.</p>
<p>“Take a look. Do you know what these are?” Liu Yun spread out his hand and saw three circular crystals of different sizes in his palm. The small one was about the size of a pigeon egg, and the big ones were like duck eggs. They swirled with rainbow colors as though they had some strange fragrance. “What are they?” Zhou Wen didn’t think they were Essence Energy Crystals, nor did they look like Zone Cores. He didn’t know what they were.</p>
<p>“Haha, let me tell you. Don’t be envious, jealous, or hateful. These are all treasures among treasures. Just now, my Terror-grade Companion Beast only ate something the size of a bean and advanced to the Calamity grade. The two advanced to the Mythical stage from taking a sniff. Furthermore, there weren’t any side effects. There are three more here, and each one is many times bigger than the other… Haha… Be envious… Be jealous… Unfortunately, you were too late. These treasures are all mine…” Liu Yun was so excited that he was almost incoherent.</p>
<p>“There’s such a thing?” Zhou Wen gaped in envy.</p>
<p>“I get it. The metal container must be Taishang Laojun’s pill furnace. These are immortal pills refined by Taishang Laojun… Perhaps it’s the legendary Nine Revolutions Golden Elixir Pill…” As Liu Yun spoke, his eyes suddenly lit up. He stared at the three crystals in his hand and muttered to himself, “These things seem indiscriminate. They can be used by any Companion Beast. I wonder if they can be used on humans?”</p>
<p>Liu Yun was fanatical about advancing to the Calamity grade, but Jing Daoxian refused to let him take shortcuts, nor was he to accept resources from the dimension. Therefore, Liu Yun had been working hard, but he was still a distance away from advancing to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Now that three treasures were suddenly placed in front of him, how could he not let his imagination run wild?</p>
<p>Furthermore, looking at the attributes of the three Companion Beasts after their evolution, not only could they evolve Companion Beasts, but the attributes they had after evolution were excellent. They weren’t inferior to Companion Beasts that evolved with Zone Cores.</p>
<p>“You’ll know when you eat it,” Zhou Wen said casually.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Liu Yun stared at the crystal in his hand for a while before throwing the smallest one into his mouth.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, do you have a death wish? You actually dare eat something like that? Taishang Laojun’s Golden Elixir Pill? Is Kunlun related to Taishang Laojun?” Zhou Wen was alarmed. Although the item was good, it wasn’t something one should randomly eat.</p>
<p>What was an elixir to Companion Beasts might be a poison that penetrated the intestines of humans.</p>
<p>“How is it unrelated? Legend has it that Kunlun is the Holy Land of Daoism. I know what I’m doing.” Liu Yun didn’t mind at all as though he was confident.</p>
<p>Just as he said that, Zhou Wen saw Liu Yun’s skin turn crystalline as though a colorful light was seeping out.</p>
<p>Liu Yun wore an excited and surprised expression. He reached out and swallowed the two big ones as well.</p>
<p>Just as he swallowed the two crystals, a strange glow rose from Liu Yun’s body. It was as though an immortal aura was spewing out, emitting a strange fragrance.</p>
<p>Liu Yun circulated the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art as his body shimmered with starlight, as though he was the center of the universe. Countless stars revolved around him like a miniature universe.</p>
<p>The pocket universe was originally a monotonous white color. As the immortal aura fused into it, it gradually turned into a gorgeous color. The energy contained in it became more and more terrifying.</p>
<p>It really works? Could it really be Taishang Laojun’s Golden Elixir Pills? Zhou Wen was dumbfounded. Liu Yun was clearly condensing a Calamity Zone to advance to the Calamity grade. Zhou Wen truly regretted it. If he had done it earlier, these treasures would have been his.</p>
<p>Soon, Liu Yun’s Calamity Zone condensed and he officially advanced to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>“Haha, Junior Brother, my dear Junior Brother, to think that you would have such a day. You’ve finally lost to me, right? Not only did this thing advance me to the Calamity grade, but the Calamity Zone I condensed is also the best among the best…” Liu Yun laughed at the sky, looking smug as though he was an emperor who had conquered a kingdom.</p>
<p>“Congratulations, Eldest Senior Brother,” Zhou Wen said as he couldn’t help but glance into the cave.</p>
<p>Since there was such an item in the cave, there might be more. Even he was tempted by such a treasure.</p>
<p>The two of them exchanged looks and instantly understood what each other was thinking. Almost at the same time, they rushed into the cave.</p>
<p>Although the immortal sword was good, that wasn’t something they could definitely get their hands on. The treasures here were real. If Taishang Laojun’s alchemy room was really inside, wouldn’t they make a killing?</p>
<p>Thinking of what Monkey Sun had done after entering Taishang Laojun’s alchemy room, Zhou Wen and Liu Yun wanted to carry out such a heist.</p>
<p>The two of them rushed into the cave one after another. Thankfully, they were relatively rational people and weren’t blinded by benefits. They were very careful and even summoned several Companion Beasts to scout ahead.</p>
<p>To their surprise, although this path was rugged and long, it wasn’t dangerous at all. The two of them proceeded carefully without anything happening. After a long while, they finally reached the end of the cave and crawled out of a hole to find themselves inside a stone chamber.</p>
<p>There were no dimensional creatures in the stone chamber. The two of them observed the stone chamber and as they looked around, their expressions turned odd.</p>
<p>The decorations in the stone chamber were very simple, almost without any decorations. There was a hole on the ground, and on both sides of the hole were two stone slabs that extended from the ground. From the shape of the hole, the metal container from before was likely embedded in this hole.</p>
<p>They connected such a setup with something bad.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1714'>Chapter 1714 Pheasant?</h3>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother, don’t you think this setup looks a little like something?” Zhou Wen said as he stared at the pit on the ground.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so.” Liu Yun turned his face and deliberately avoided Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Put that metal container into the pit. If you do So, I think it resembles…” Before Zhou Wen could finish his sentence, Liu Yun interrupted him violently.</p>
<p>“Shut up. What do you mean it resembles something? It resembles nothing. Cut the crap! There’s a door there. Let’s see if it can be opened.” As Liu Yun spoke, he walked towards the door without looking back as though he was running for his life. There was even a faint retching sound.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood that Liu Yun definitely had the same thoughts as him.</p>
<p>No matter how I look at it, it looks like a squatting toilet. Could the metal container be Kunlun Mountain’s toilet? If the metal container is really a toilet, wouldn’t that make the so-called Golden Elixir Pills that Liu Yun ate… Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>However, he quickly had second thoughts. I don’t think so. How strong are the fellows in Kunlun Mountain to produce feces that can advance a person to the Calamity grade!? “The door here can be opened. There seems to be a garden behind it.” Liu Yun had already cracked open the door with a push and looked out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly followed and looked out through the crack in the door. Indeed, there was a garden outside. All sorts of flowers and plants that he had never seen or heard of were scattered across the garden. They looked like they had grown naturally and hadn’t been artificially tended. However, they had a strange beauty to them, as though they were deserving of such beauty.</p>
<p>The garden seemed huge with no end in sight. There was a blue sky and white clouds above them with no other buildings.</p>
<p>“There seems to be a creature over there,” Liu Yun whispered. Zhou Wen also saw a white bird lying in a flower patch in the distance. Due to the cover of the flower shrubs, he couldn’t see its full appearance. He only saw that its upper body resembled a peacock, but it was somewhat different.</p>
<p>“Could that be the phoenix you mentioned?” Zhou Wen whispered to Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“Are you stupid? A phoenix lives on a divine tree. How can a phoenix set up a nest in grass? Besides, have you seen a white phoenix?” Liu Yun rolled his eyes and said angrily. “That’s true. That’s a pheasant in the grass.” Zhou Wen thought that it made sense.</p>
<p>The two of them carefully sized up the surroundings through the crack in the door. Apart from the white pheasant, they didn’t see any other creatures, much less any other buildings.</p>
<p>“That’s strange. There’s only one pheasant here. Then who’s the toilet for? Could it be that pheasant?” Zhou Wen muttered.</p>
<p>“Do you believe that I’ll fight you to the death if you continue?” Liu Yun felt like vomiting again as he forcefully held back.</p>
<p>“I’m just saying. Don’t take it seriously. Perhaps it’s not a toilet at all,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>Liu Yun gritted his teeth and didn’t make a sound. He continued observing the situation outside. After a while, he said, “Should we go out and take a look? There seems to be only a pheasant in the garden. It shouldn’t be too dangerous.”</p>
<p>“That might not be the case.” Zhou Wen didn’t think so.</p>
<p>If the things inside the metal container were really produced by the pheasant, Zhou Wen felt that heading out with Liu Yun was equivalent to delivering themselves to their deaths.</p>
<p>“Forget it. Let’s go out. There’s almost no time. It’s best if we retrieve the sword early,” Liu Yun said gloomily.</p>
<p>Just as the two of them were about to return the way they came, they suddenly heard a strange cry coming from the garden.</p>
<p>“Quack! Quack!” The white bird let out a strange cry that sounded like a duck’s quack. The sound was extremely unpleasant.</p>
<p>After a few cries, the white bird stood up. Only then did Zhou Wen and Liu Yun see its full appearance.</p>
<p>Its head looked a little like a peacock’s, but its back was like a pheasant’s. It didn’t have the long feathers of a peacock.</p>
<p>“Pui, it’s really a pheasant.” Liu Yun cursed his bad luck inwardly. If the things inside the metal container were really shat out by this pheasant, he felt his stomach churn just thinking about it.</p>
<p>After the pheasant stood up, it leisurely strolled in the garden. After taking a few steps, it pecked at the flowers. It was unknown what it was pecking at.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen saw what the pheasant was doing, he felt a chill run down his spine.</p>
<p>The pheasant was eating the fruits in the grass, but the fruits looked a little strange. The fruits in the grass were the size of a fist and looked like babies in a uterus.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s eyesight, he could see that there were clear facial features on the faces of the grass fruits. If it wasn’t for the grass vines, he would have imagined that it was a baby that had been taken out prematurely via a C-section.</p>
<p>The pheasant swallowed each fruit in one mouthful. It was unknown what they tasted like.</p>
<p>“Could this thing be a ginseng fruit? That thing blooms every three thousand years and bears fruit every three thousand years. It needs another three thousand years to ripen. It’s a good thing that takes ten thousand years to produce.” Liu Yun’s eyes lit up when he saw this. It was obvious that he was up to no good.</p>
<p>“Is your brain damaged? Ginseng fruits grow on the ginseng fruit trees. What’s here is clearly a grass fruit. Furthermore, the legendary ginseng fruit should be in the house of that Earth Immortal ancestor. Why is it on Mount Kunlun?” Zhou Wen said angrily.</p>
<p>“That’s true.” Liu Yun was immediately deflated.</p>
<p>As the two of them were talking, they suddenly heard the pheasant let out another ugly cry and run.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly looked over and was slightly alarmed by the scene he saw. He saw the pheasant running with all its might, chasing after a grass fruit.</p>
<p>The grass fruit was much bigger than the typical grass fruit. It was completely white like a chubby baby. The pheasant chased after it, and the grass fruit baby ran ahead. It jumped around in the garden, and the pheasant wasn’t able to catch up to it.</p>
<p>After watching for a moment, Liu Yun cheered inwardly. He was glad that he hadn’t really gone out. Otherwise, if he had really been targeted by that pheasant, it would be a question if he could come out alive.</p>
<p>The speed at which the pheasant chased after the baby was so fast that even they as Calamity-grade creatures couldn’t see it clearly. Even if they could see it clearly, their reaction speed couldn’t keep up.</p>
<p>“Let’s leave quickly.” Liu Yun felt that this place was too dangerous. It was best to leave as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“Let’s watch a little longer.” Zhou Wen kept staring at the grass fruit baby.</p>
<p>The grass fruit baby’s speed wasn’t slower than a pheasant’s. Furthermore, he could use the soil, flowers, and other objects in the garden to escape. It didn’t seem like it was only proficient in Earth Escape, but it could also use Wood Escape and Water Escape.</p>
<p>This thing is a little like a Ginseng Baby Companion Beast, but it’s at an even higher level. Ginseng Babies only know how to escape through the earth. This fellow has already displayed three escape techniques. Could it be that it can use the escape techniques of all five elements? Zhou Wen was intrigued by the grass fruit baby.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1715'>Chapter 1715 New Dungeon</h3>
<p>“Holy sh*t, these two things are awesome!” Liu Yun’s eyes were sharp enough. He could see most of an average Calamity-grade battle.</p>
<p>But now, he couldn’t see the actions of the pheasant and the grass fruit baby. All he could see were two beams of light bouncing around the garden.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid it’s more amazing than you imagine,” Zhou Wen added.</p>
<p>His words came from the bottom of his heart. Zhou Wen had already seen top Calamity creatures. Even existences as powerful as Truth Listener and Starlady Polestar couldn’t do what the pheasant and the grass fruit baby were doing</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if the pheasant and the baby were creatures above the Calamity grade, but he was certain of one thing. In terms of speed, the pheasant and the grass fruit baby were probably above Truth Listener and Starlady Polestar.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen didn’t have any speed-measuring equipment. At their level, it was difficult to tell the difference in speed with the naked eye.</p>
<p>However, there was a very obvious difference between Starlady Polestar and the pheasant. When Starlady Polestar and Truth Listener moved at such speeds, they would produce a terrifying shockwave. Just the shockwave alone could destroy everything beneath the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>However, the pheasant was so fast that there was no sonic boom or sound of it breaking through the sound barrier, much less a shockwave. Even the flowers and grass beside it weren’t damaged at all. It looked like they were still growing strong. This alone proved that it was extraordinary.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen vaguely felt that the pheasant might be a legendary Apocalypse-grade existence, but it was only a guess. After all, he had never seen what an Apocalypse-grade existence looked like. Perhaps this was a top Speed-type Calamity.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, what do you think that baby-like grass fruit is? Even such a powerful dimensional creature wants to eat it. What will happen if we eat it?” Liu Yun couldn’t help but whisper with envy.</p>
<p>“I advise you not to court death.” Zhou Wen was also envious, but he knew very well how terrifying the pheasant’s speed was. Just this speed wasn’t something they could match. If Zhou Wen fused with Great Brahma, he could still hold out a little. Liu Yun would definitely die instantly. It wouldn’t even take him a second to die.</p>
<p>“I’m not stupid. It’s just a thought. I have to go back and flip through the books to see what those fruits are. Even if I can’t eat the big one, aren’t there still many small fruits in the garden? Perhaps I can think of a way to get a few.” Liu Yun was a shrewd person. He felt terrible returning empty-handed from a garden filled with treasures.</p>
<p>“How? Do you dare to head out and pluck them?” Zhou Wen also wanted to get a few grass fruits, but with the pheasant outside, the risk was too great.</p>
<p>“It’s indeed a little dangerous for us to steal them ourselves. We can get our Companion Beasts to steal them while that pheasant is attracted by the grass fruit baby. I have a Companion Beast that’s best at Earth Escape and invisibility. It should be easy to pluck two grass fruits by burrowing to a spot underneath the grass fruits before returning.”</p>
<p>Liu Yun changed the topic and continued, “However, just in case, I think we should cooperate. You should also get a few Companion Beasts. If my Companion Beasts are discovered, they can go out in time to distract that pheasant so that my Companion Beast can return safely. When the time comes, everyone will get a share of the fruits. However, there’s something you have to be careful of. That pheasant’s level definitely isn’t low. It will probably be difficult for ordinary Companion Beasts to attract its attention. It’s best if you bring out some high-level Companion Beasts.” “Dream on. Using my high-level Companion Beast as cannon fodder?” Zhou Wen curled his lips.</p>
<p>“If you have a Companion Beast that can turn invisible and use Earth Escape, you can steal the grass fruits. I don’t mind releasing my Companion Beasts to be the shield. You have to do something, right? You can’t just sit idle and wait for the benefits, right?” Liu Yun said with a smile.</p>
<p>“I don’t have such a Companion Beast, but I don’t want them to be cannon fodder. If you want to steal it, steal it yourself. I won’t snatch it from you.” Zhou Wen really didn’t plan on stealing it.</p>
<p>After all, the dungeon here was already downloading. After the dungeon finished downloading, he could obtain the fruits in-game. There was no need to take the risk. “Alright, let’s make it clear first. Don’t be jealous of the fruits I bring back. Don’t you try to snatch mine.” Liu Yun had wanted to pull Zhou Wen along because he was afraid that he would ruin his plans.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. Am I someone who does such things?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, you are,” Liu Yun said mercilessly.</p>
<p>“Alright, I guarantee not to touch the fruits you steal. Will that do?” Zhou Wen said as he spread out his hands.</p>
<p>“That’s more like it.” Liu Yun nodded in satisfaction before beginning to summon his Companion Beasts. Zhou Wen originally wanted to see what Companion Beasts Liu Yun had summoned, but his phone suddenly produced a chime.</p>
<p>The dungeon is done downloading? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled. The download time for the dungeon was much faster than he imagined.</p>
<p>According to past experience, the higher the level of the dungeon, the slower the download time. It hadn’t been long, but the dungeon had already been downloaded. Didn’t that mean that this dungeon wasn’t very high-level? However, on second thought, he felt that something was amiss. From the metal container and crystals to the pheasant and the grass fruit baby, they were not things that could appear in low-level dungeons. It had to be a high-level dungeon.</p>
<p>If this is really a high-level dungeon, there’s only one possibility left. Has the download speed sped up after the phone was charged? Zhou Wen guessed as he took out his phone to take a look. Indeed, there was an icon on the phone’s home screen. It was the symbol of Xicheng Mountain.</p>
<p>It’s really Kunlun Mountain! Zhou Wen was alarmed and delighted when he saw the name under the icon.</p>
<p>Kunlun Mountain’s status in myths was just too high. It was likely that there weren’t many dimensional zones on Earth that were better than Kunlun Mountain.</p>
<p>If one had the strength to clear the Kunlun Mountain instance dungeon, they could dominate all the dimensional zones on Earth.</p>
<p>More importantly, a dimensional zone like Kunlun Mountain might be the testing ground for true Earth’s Companion Beast to choose its owner. After clearing the level, he might even be able to obtain Earth’s Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Of course, if he really discovered that Kunlun Mountain was the testing ground for Earth’s Companion Beast, Zhou Wen would be on guard in reality to prevent others from clearing the level. This was to prevent Earth’s Companion Beast from appearing and blowing up Earth.</p>
<p>Let me see what’s different between the ordinary and hidden modes of Kunlun Mountain. Zhou Wen already had some guesses, but he still needed to confirm them.</p>
<p>After launching the Kunlun Mountain dungeon, Zhou Wen first chose the ordinary mode. After entering, he realized that the blood-colored avatar was standing in front of the Kunlun Mountain’s north entrance. He circled the Kunlun Mountain, but he didn’t discover anything special.</p>
<p>Then, he switched to the hidden mode and entered the Kunlun Mountain instance dungeon again. He quickly discovered something, but this time, he discovered a lot more.</p>
<p>In the past, the hidden dungeon would only have one spot with a concealed halo. As for the Kunlun Mountain dungeon, there were five places with hidden haloes. They looked like the five hidden gates in Kunlun Mountain.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1716'>Chapter 1716 Caught Between a Rock and a Hard Place</h3>
<p>Two of the five places with a concealed halo were the cave he was in and the pool that Liu Yun had taken Zhou Wen to.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen chose to open the cave in-game. Just as he was about to enter the cave, Liu Yun had already released his Companion Beast that sneaked towards the grass fruit.</p>
<p>It was a Companion Beast that looked like a rat, but it was slightly bigger than a cat. After it was summoned, its body jolted before it vanished in front of Zhou Wen. It was unknown what kind of invisibility it had used, but even his hearing couldn’t sense its existence.</p>
<p>Liu Yun actually has such a Companion Beast? Zhou Wen was alarmed. Just as he was about to use other methods to see if he could track it, the Companion Beast had already crawled out of the stone chamber and headed for the grass fruit.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen couldn’t see it, he could vaguely sense the location of the Companion Beast. After switching a few Essence Energy Arts and using Great Brahma’s powers, he saw its true body. Its invisibility ability couldn’t hide from Great Brahma’s Buddha Eyes.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast was also proficient in Earth Escape. After entering the garden, it vanished the moment it landed. When it appeared again, it was already beside a grass fruit. It extended its claws and was about to pluck the grass fruit when it suddenly saw a white light flash.</p>
<p>ISmr</p>
<p>Before Liu Yun could unsummon the Companion Beast, he saw it vanish. The pheasant’s figure appeared as it raised its neck as though it had swallowed something.</p>
<p>“My Shadow Rat!” Liu Yun’s expression changed drastically. The other Companion Beasts he had prepared didn’t have the time to draw away the pheasant’s attention.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare continue gaming as he observed the pheasant’s reaction. Once the pheasant did anything out of order, he would immediately escape.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the pheasant didn’t seem to notice the stone chamber. After swallowing Liu Yun’s Shadow Rat, it immediately chased after the grass fruit baby.</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother, my condolences,” Zhou Wen consoled.</p>
<p>“F*ck off. That’s a unique Shadow Rat. It wasn’t easy for me to feed it to the Calamity grade. Do you know how much effort I spent on it…” Liu Yun cursed gloomily.</p>
<p>“This is life. It’s best if we leave quickly.” Zhou Wen didn’t wish to waste time here. Since he had already downloaded the game, there was no point in staying here.</p>
<p>Although Liu Yun was still somewhat indignant, he knew that things couldn’t be undone. Just as he was about to leave with Zhou Wen, he suddenly saw a flash of light. The grass fruit baby had burrowed into the stone chamber and was standing between Zhou Wen and Liu Yun. Its huge eyes that were extremely disproportionate to its face sized up Zhou Wen and Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t! Zhou Wen and Liu Yun felt their backs turn cold as they immediately had the thought of escaping.</p>
<p>However, this thought only existed in their mind and couldn’t be realized. Just as he looked at the hole from the corner of his eye, he saw a white figure standing there—it was the white pheasant.</p>
<p>“We’re doomed!” The two of them felt their hearts turn cold.</p>
<p>However, they weren’t the kind of people who would sit back and do nothing. They didn’t think at all and instinctively reacted.</p>
<p>Liu Yun instant transmitted to the garden outside the stone chamber.</p>
<p>The pheasant was standing at the hole at the exit. Instant transmission in that direction was almost equivalent to courting death. There might be a chance of survival if he rushed into the garden.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, Zhou Wen made the same reaction. However, while he instant transmitted, he had already completed the fusion with Great Brahma. When he instant transmitted, he was already wearing dark-gold armor. The dark-gold wheel on his back emitted a dark black hole-like glow.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The duo who had instant transmitted simultaneously seemed to slam into a stone wall and bounced back at the same time.</p>
<p>Liu Yun fell on his ass. Zhou Wen could barely stand, but he felt his head buzz from the collision. He felt like he had a concussion.</p>
<p>The pheasant and the grass baby remained rooted to the ground as they looked at the two of them from both sides.</p>
<p>“I told you to retrieve the sword earlier, but you insisted on wandering around. Look at what happened now? My life is gone because of you,” Liu Yun said with a sullen expression.</p>
<p>He knew that he couldn’t escape, so he didn’t even bother getting up. He just sat on the ground and looked at the two creatures.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t move again. The Teacher Domain had already been activated as he scanned the situation in the stone chamber, hoping to know what power had trapped them inside.</p>
<p>Strangely, there were no traces of the nomological powers of the pheasant and the grass fruit baby in the stone chamber. Clearly, the power that prevented them from instant transmitting out of the stone chamber didn’t come from the two strange creatures.</p>
<p>The power of the stone chamber is what’s stopping us from leaving? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Liu Yun didn’t move, nor did the pheasant and the grass fruit baby take the initiative to attack. They only sized them up as though they were somewhat curious about them.</p>
<p>“I didn’t ask you to come in,” Zhou Wen said casually as he looked at the half-open door.</p>
<p>He couldn’t leave with spatial instant transmission, but it didn’t mean that he couldn’t leave. Perhaps this stone chamber only restricted spatial instant transmission. Perhaps there wouldn’t be any restrictions if one walked out of the door.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen knew very well that with his speed, it was impossible for him to be faster than the pheasant and the grass fruit baby. They hadn’t attacked yet, so if he rashly rushed out, he might immediately infuriate them.</p>
<p>“Anyway, nothing good will come from being with you. My life will be lost because of you sooner or later.” Liu Yun also realized the subtle situation. He just sat there and spoke without any intention of rushing out.</p>
<p>The pheasant’s silver eyes sized up the two of them, but after looking at them for a while, it seemed to lose interest in them and focused its gaze on the grass fruit baby.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, this fellow isn’t interested in eating meat. Zhou Wen was immediately delighted.</p>
<p>Indeed, the pheasant raised its claws and walked to the side as though it wanted to circle around Zhou Wen and Liu Yun to continue its hunt of the grass fruit baby.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was also overjoyed. At that moment, he didn’t dare say another word to prevent himself from provoking the pheasant.</p>
<p>As long as the pheasant charged at the grass fruit baby, the two of them would have a chance of burrowing out of the cave and leaving this terrifying place. Zhou Wen was calculating how far the pheasant needed to leave the cave before he could successfully rush out, but to his surprise, the pheasant only took two steps before the grass fruit baby moved.</p>
<p>The baby’s figure flashed and vanished from their sight.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother… You… On your head…” Liu Yun widened his eyes as he looked at Zhou Wen’s head as though he had seen a ghost.</p>
<p>If not for the Great Brahma armor covering Zhou Wen’s face, no one would have been able to see his face. They would definitely have realized that his expression was worse than Liu Yun’s.</p>
<p>This was because the grass fruit baby had jumped onto Zhou Wen’s head. It sat on the dark-gold helmet as its white feet levitated above Zhou Wen’s forehead, swaying back and forth.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1717'>Chapter 1717 A Delicate Situation</h3>
<p>“Junior Brother, it’s not that I don’t want to help you, but it’s just that you’re too unlucky As a person, you have to accept your fate. In the future, I’ll burn more paper money for you every year. Three incense sticks every year will definitely be plenty…” Liu Yun inched back as he spoke.</p>
<p>The pheasant stared intently at Zhou Wen’s head as it carefully raised its claws and carefully approached him, like a ferocious bird that could attack at any moment.</p>
<p>Liu Yun had seen the speed of the pheasant. With a peck from it, the grass fruit baby might be able to dodge it, but Zhou Wen probably wouldn’t be able to. Perhaps the beak would pierce through his head. No matter how powerful his recovery abilities were, he probably wouldn’t survive.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared at the pheasant without moving his body, but his brain was rapidly working</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen were to reach out to chase the grass fruit baby away, he might lure the pheasant into attacking immediately. However, if Zhou Wen didn’t take action, the pheasant’s aura would reach an unbelievable level. It would probably be even harder to deal with it.</p>
<p>There was no solution. Instantly, Zhou Wen fell into a dilemma.</p>
<p>If it were an ordinary person, their first choice would definitely be to shake off the grass fruit baby on their head, but Zhou Wen didn’t do so.</p>
<p>The grass fruit baby clearly wants to use me as a shield, but unfortunately, I’m not someone who can be controlled by you. You need to pay the price for using me. With a thought, Zhou Wen circulated the First Order of Chaos. The Chaos Egg instantly enveloped his body, including the grass fruit baby above him.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg could typically only protect Zhou Wen, but if the object was very close to him, such as his clothes, it would also be within its confines.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched from the side for a long time and could tell that although the grass fruit baby’s escape technique was special, its offensive strength was probably far inferior to that of the pheasant. After enveloping it in the Chaos Egg and with Great Brahma protecting him, he didn’t have to worry about the grass fruit baby harming him inside.</p>
<p>When the grass fruit baby realized that it was trapped by the Chaos Egg, it wasn’t worried at first. It even sized up the Chaos Egg curiously.</p>
<p>When the pheasant saw the Chaos Egg, it was also somewhat curious. It didn’t attack immediately. After observing for a moment, it exerted strength with its claws and, like a ghost, appeared by the Chaos Egg. It struck down at the Chaos Egg with its beak.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg’s defense was almost invincible. Even the Heaven-level Starlady Polestar couldn’t break through the Chaos Egg’s defense. It was only because her strength was too powerful that it produced too many Essence Energy Crystals in the Chaos Egg, causing it to explode.</p>
<p>Although the pheasant’s strike was terrifying and had the ability to penetrate all seemingly indestructible objects, it failed to penetrate the Chaos Egg</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg’s outer shell was crushed by the beak like a deformed balloon. However, it ultimately didn’t shatter, managing to block the pheasant’s beak.</p>
<p>Inside the Chaos Egg, a large number of Essence Energy Crystals appeared out of thin air. The production was in no way inferior to the speed at which Starlady Polestar’s attacks produced them. This strike nearly filled the Chaos Egg with Essence Energy Crystals. It was almost without gaps.</p>
<p>The grass fruit baby was alarmed as its figure flashed in a bid to escape with an escape technique.</p>
<p>However, its head slammed into the Chaos Egg-it failed to escape. It bounced back and landed on Zhou Wen’s head again. Zhou Wen felt a lot more at ease. Although the pheasant’s offensive strength was powerful, it was still within the Calamity grade range. It didn’t have any crushing destructive power.</p>
<p>As long as it’s not at the Apocalypse grade, my Great Brahma might be able to put up a fight. Zhou Wen secretly heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>The grass fruit baby was somewhat anxious. It tried a few more times, but it failed to rush out of the Chaos Egg. Just as Zhou Wen had expected, although its escape technique was very special, it was difficult to realize it in an independent space like the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Blame yourself for taking the hard way out. You asked for it; don’t blame me. As Zhou Wen’s mind raced, the Chaos Egg flew into the garden. At the same time, he used Imperial Lord Behemoth to devour the large number of Essence Energy Crystals produced by the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>The originally flustered grass fruit baby suddenly stopped and stared at the Essence Energy Crystals as though it had discovered a new brand new world.</p>
<p>No way? Zhou Wen realized something. Before he could do anything, the grass fruit baby opened its mouth and sucked in the Essence Energy Crystals nearby.</p>
<p>Its tiny mouth didn’t look big, but its devouring speed was even faster than the Imperial Lord Behemoth. In a moment, it sucked most of the Essence Energy Crystals into its stomach.</p>
<p>Its petite body was like a bottomless pit. A large number of Essence Energy Crystals were sucked in, but its belly didn’t react at all. It didn’t even swell.</p>
<p>The pheasant outside seemed a little surprised that its attack failed. When it saw the Chaos Egg fly towards the garden, it attacked with its beak again. Although the Chaos Egg wasn’t slow, it was much slower than the pheasant. The latter easily struck it.</p>
<p>A large number of Essence Energy Crystals were produced in the Chaos Egg again. According to Zhou Wen’s original calculations, even if Imperial Lord Behemoth were to devour the Essence Energy Crystals, the Chaos Egg could only withstand four or five strikes before it exploded from the excessive crystals.</p>
<p>However, now that the grass fruit baby had sucked in a large number of Essence Energy Crystals while the pheasant had repeatedly pecked at the Chaos Egg, there weren’t many Essence Energy Crystals produced-most of them were sucked away by the grass fruit baby.</p>
<p>This fellow is indeed Egg Sovereign… However, this thing’s defense is stronger than I imagined. It can actually withstand such attacks! Liu Yun was alarmed.</p>
<p>What surprised him wasn’t Zhou Wen being Egg Sovereign, but the Chaos Egg’s defense.</p>
<p>Liu Yun didn’t know the trick underlying it and imagined that the Chaos Egg could really withstand the pheasant, but Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown slightly.</p>
<p>Although he was temporarily safe and the Chaos Egg wouldn’t explode anytime soon, the grass fruit baby’s body gradually underwent a strange change as it constantly absorbed Essence Energy Crystals.</p>
<p>Its body was snow-white and crystalline like a snow-white lotus root, but at that moment, a strange red glow gradually suffused from it.</p>
<p>The red glow was misty and smokelike as it seeped out of the snow-white body, giving the baby a ruddy look. It was as though a pale-faced patient had regained their color.</p>
<p>As a large number of Essence Energy Crystals were sucked away by it, the red glow intensified.</p>
<p>The pheasant attacked a few times, but it failed to crack the Chaos Egg. It seemed to be vexed as it exerted all its strength. Its head was like a sewing machine as it kept pecking at the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>The number of Essence Energy Crystals in the Chaos Egg increased exponentially. Zhou Wen was originally worried that it would explode, but he never expected the baby’s absorption speed to increase. The Essence Energy Crystals that were just produced were sucked into its stomach almost immediately.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1718'>Chapter 1718 Battling the Pheasant in the Garden</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if he should be happy or worried. With the existence of the grass fruit baby, he didn’t have to worry about the Chaos Egg exploding. However, it was also because of the existence of the grass fruit baby that Zhou Wen was somewhat worried. This thing had absorbed so many Essence Energy Crystals that its body was becoming redder and redder. It was like a red-hot branding iron. Who knew what other tricks it could pull.</p>
<p>Although the grass fruit baby didn’t have any offensive strength and hadn’t displayed any powerful offensive means after being trapped by Zhou Wen, with only a notably powerful escape technique, the world was sometimes unpredictable. Water was considered a relatively malleable material that typically couldn’t harm a human’s body.</p>
<p>However, ignoring the floods and tsunamis, just water pressure at a high enough level could slice through rock and steel.</p>
<p>If anything abnormal happened after the grass fruit baby absorbed a large number of Essence Energy Crystals, it might become an existence that was more lethal than the pheasant.</p>
<p>Although he knew of the potential problems, there was no good solution. If he unsummoned the Chaos Egg now, Zhou Wen would have to face the pheasant’s relentless attacks.</p>
<p>The offensive strength displayed by the pheasant was definitely not weaker than Truth Listener.</p>
<p>Of course, Truth Listener’s might wasn’t completely determined by its offensive strength, but to be comparable to Truth Listener in terms of offensive strength gave Zhou Wen a headache.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for the fact that Truth Listener couldn’t be summoned, I wouldn’t be in such a situation. Zhou Wen steeled his heart and charged towards the stone chamber’s door.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen expected, although the stone chamber forbade spatial powers, it didn’t forbid entry and exit. The Chaos Egg immediately squeezed out of the stone chamber’s door and rolled into the garden.</p>
<p>The pheasant rushed out as well and continued pecking at the Chaos Egg crazily.</p>
<p>The grass fruit baby’s body was already as red as ruby. The red glow inside was blinding. Thankfully, its body didn’t produce a temperature, so it didn’t cause any substantial damage to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen attempted to use instant transmission in the garden and realized that it wasn’t forbidden. However, when he instant transmitted, the pheasant had already appeared beside him and continued pecking.</p>
<p>Being able to use spatial instant transmission made Zhou Wen feel a lot more at ease. After the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art advanced to the Calamity grade, his instant transmission ability had greatly increased. Although he couldn’t continuously instant transmit without any delays, it wasn’t something an ordinary person could compare with.</p>
<p>Seeing that the grass fruit baby’s body seemed to be undergoing a tremendous change, Zhou Wen knew that he couldn’t wait any longer. Once it underwent a qualitative change, his situation might become more dire.</p>
<p>Gritting his teeth, Zhou Wen unsummoned the Chaos Egg and exposed himself to the pheasant.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, Zhou Wen used Universe Inversion to rapidly and continuously instant transmit, hoping to escape the pheasant’s attack.</p>
<p>In any case, the pheasant’s original target was the grass fruit baby. Even if he was accidentally injured, as long as he survived the first attack, the pheasant would probably chase after the grass fruit baby.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s plan was good, but after he instant transmitted, he realized that the grass fruit baby had appeared behind him, sticking to him like a shadow and was lying on his shoulder.</p>
<p>The pheasant pecked down at the same time. It was so fast that instant transmission was impossible to dodge in time.</p>
<p>“If the tiger doesn’t show its might, do you think I’m HELLO KITTY?” The Great Brahma armor on Zhou Wen’s body shimmered with a dark glow as he threw a punch forward.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to fight the pheasant head-on because he was afraid that it would be too powerful. Secondly, he was afraid that the commotion caused by the battle would attract other terrifying creatures.</p>
<p>This was Kunlun Mountain, an unimaginable and terrifying place in myths. Legend had it that countless immortals gathered here. Who knew how many terrifying creatures like the pheasant existed here?</p>
<p>However, he couldn’t care less now. He had to stay alive first.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that his full-powered strike would destroy a large section of the garden if it collided with the pheasant, but to his surprise, after the fist collided with the beak, there was only a dull thud. The expected explosion and shockwave didn’t happen.</p>
<p>There’s something wrong with this garden! Zhou Wen immediately realized the problem.</p>
<p>Previously, when the pheasant was chasing after the grass fruit baby, they didn’t cause any sonic booms or shockwaves. From the looks of it, it wasn’t because they could control their strength, but because there was some force in the garden that suppressed the spread of energy.</p>
<p>The power of the Heaven-level Great Brahma had annihilative power that could destroy almost everything. However, in the clash with the pheasant’s power, he didn’t gain any advantage.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen wasn’t at a disadvantage. The pheasant retreated from Zhou Wen’s punch as his legs went limp and he nearly knelt on the ground.</p>
<p>This didn’t mean that Great Brahma’s strength was inferior to the pheasant, but that Zhou Wen’s physique was too poor. His Terror-grade body was still too weak in such a battle. Just the remnant forces that entered Great Brahma’s armor made it difficult for his body to withstand them.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, Junior Brother, what’s with your armor? Why is it so powerful?” Liu Yun, who was sneaking a peep from the stone chamber, nearly fell over when he saw Zhou Wen send the pheasant retreating several steps with a single punch. He was so jealous that his eyes turned red.</p>
<p>The pheasant’s ferocity was triggered by Zhou Wen’s punch. It flapped its wings and charged forward with a strange cry, constantly attacking Zhou Wen like a ribbon of light.</p>
<p>Liu Yun couldn’t see the pheasant’s actions at all, but Zhou Wen could see them clearly with Great Brahma’s augmentation. However, Great Brahma wasn’t good at speed. He couldn’t keep up despite being able to see it.</p>
<p>After he brandished his fists to block a few pecks, he found himself unable to dodge the next peck.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to use his body to withstand the pheasant’s peck, he suddenly felt his vision blur. His body had mysteriously appeared elsewhere in the garden.</p>
<p>The grass fruit baby! Zhou Wen immediately realized what had happened. The grass fruit baby lying on him had definitely used an escape technique to dodge the pheasant’s peck.</p>
<p>How could the pheasant give up? It charged over almost at the same time and began fighting Zhou Wen again.</p>
<p>Great Brahma’s destructive power wasn’t afraid of the pheasant’s powerful strength at all. It was just that its speed was inferior. However, every time Zhou Wen was in danger, the grass fruit baby would take the initiative to use an escape technique to help him dodge the attack. It was difficult to determine the victor.</p>
<p>How did Junior Brother cultivate? He actually reached such a stage as a pure human! Liu Yun was dumbfounded as he drooled in envy.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t too happy because his worst fears came true. Deep in the garden, a terrifying aura came from afar.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1719'>Chapter 1719 Phoenix Breed</h3>
<p>Half of the sky in the garden was dyed golden. It was a huge, strange golden bird that looked like a cross between an eagle and a condor. Its golden wings spread out as though they blotted out half the sky.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, could it be a Golden-Winged Roc? Zhou Wen remembered seeing a creature suspected to be a Roc, but it wasn’t that big, nor did it have such a terrifying aura.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t be sure if it was the Golden-Winged Roc, but he was certain that the golden-winged bird was at least at the Heaven level. It might be at the legendary Apocalypse grade. I can’t stay in this godforsaken place any longer. As Zhou Wen fought the pheasant, he rushed towards the stone chamber.</p>
<p>He had failed to find a way out despite fighting in the garden for so long.</p>
<p>The blue sky above the garden had white fluffy clouds. His spatial powers weren’t nullified, but when Zhou Wen wanted to use interstellar teleportation to leave, he realized that he couldn’t contact the stars outside.</p>
<p>The garden seemed endless. No matter in which direction he scanned, all he saw was an endless garden.</p>
<p>The pheasant was cleverer than Zhou Wen imagined. It clearly saw through Zhou Wen’s intentions and stopped fighting him. Instead, it blocked the stone chamber’s entrance—the only way out.</p>
<p>There was a spatial seal in the stone chamber, so he could only forcefully rush in. Zhou Wen gritted his teeth as the Great Brahma armor on his body circulated with dark swirling light, erupting with unparalleled destructive power. Zhou Wen punched the pheasant blocking the door.</p>
<p>Although Great Brahma’s speed was inferior to the pheasant’s, his destructive power wasn’t inferior to it. Zhou Wen wanted to blast the pheasant apart and rush into the stone chamber to escape.</p>
<p>The pheasant had a stubborn temper. Despite knowing that its strength was inferior to Zhou Wen’s, it refused to dodge—it was bent on stopping him.</p>
<p>Just as the fist was about to strike the pheasant, Zhou Wen was secretly delighted when a golden light suddenly rose in front of him. The resplendent golden-winged bird appeared behind the pheasant. Its golden wings bent down to protect its body.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The destructive force struck the golden wings, but not a single feather fell. The golden-winged bird’s body seemed to be stronger than the pheasant’s.</p>
<p>“This trope of the older one coming after the younger one is defeated seriously gets old. Junior Brother, take care. I’ll take my leave now.” Liu Yun shouted before burrowing into the hole and leaving without looking back.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen cursed inwardly. From the looks of it, the white pheasant was most likely the golden-winged bird’s fledgling. If a fledgling was already so terrifying, there was no need to mention the golden-winged bird. Just its speed and defense alone made Zhou Wen lose the desire to fight.</p>
<p>The golden-winged bird was clearly infuriated by Zhou Wen’s punch as it let out a screech. Its body emitted a golden glow as it spread its wings that blotted out the sky and fanned at Zhou Wen with a terrifying aura.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already prepared to fight a bloody battle with all his might. The black hole-like wheel of light behind the Great Brahma armor spun as though it was connected to hell.</p>
<p>Just as the battle was about to begin, they suddenly heard an ear-piercing and discordant strange cry.</p>
<p>When the golden-winged bird heard the cry, it suddenly stopped flapping its wings and slowly retreated.</p>
<p>What does it want? Zhou Wen frowned as he looked at the pheasant and the golden-winged bird behind it. The pheasant was still screaming at the golden-winged bird. The golden-winged bird took a few steps back and suddenly made an action that nearly made Zhou Wen’s eyes pop out.</p>
<p>It actually prostrated in front of the pheasant. From the looks of it, it was extremely respectful to the pheasant. It didn’t look like a mother treating her child. Instead, it looked like a subject paying respects to a monarch.</p>
<p>The pheasant screeched angrily at the golden-winged bird that prostrated. Its arrogant look was like a slave owner insulting its slave.</p>
<p>The golden-winged bird lay there motionless. No matter how the pheasant cursed, it remained unmoved as though it was only right for the pheasant to treat it like this.</p>
<p>Heavens! What’s going on? The golden-winged bird looks like the legendary Golden-Winged Roc. Even if it’s not a Golden-Winged Roc, it’s at least a Heaven-level existence. In terms of combat strength, it’s above the pheasant. Why is it so respectful and reverent towards the pheasant? Zhou Wen was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>The pheasant seemed to be done cursing. Then, it turned around and looked at Zhou Wen. In the next second, it pounced over as though it wanted to skin Zhou Wen alive.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to fight the pheasant again. What was depressing was that regardless if the Golden-Winged Roc had done it deliberately or not, it was blocking the stone chamber’s door, preventing Zhou Wen from having the chance to rush in.</p>
<p>What’s up with this pheasant? Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>The pheasant’s combat strength was clearly inferior to the golden-winged bird, yet the golden-winged bird was so reverent to it. Apart from having a natural bloodline and race advantage, Zhou Wen really couldn’t figure out why the golden-winged bird was reverent towards the pheasant.</p>
<p>Could it be that this pheasant is a real phoenix? Zhou Wen had no choice but to have his suspicions.</p>
<p>In certain myths, the phoenix had once given birth to the Peacock Bright King and the Golden-Winged Roc. If that golden-winged bird was really a Roc, then the only one who could make the Golden-Winged Roc bow its head in terms of bloodline and race was the phoenix. Even the Peacock Bright King didn’t have such rights.</p>
<p>However, no matter how he looked at it, the white bird in front of him was like a pheasant, not the legendary supreme divine phoenix.</p>
<p>On second thought, Zhou Wen realized that it wasn’t unacceptable. The chick he reared was also a phoenix. Ignoring the fact that it didn’t look like one when it was young, it still didn’t look like one now.</p>
<p>Despite both being phoenixes, Chick’s level was clearly not as high as the pheasant. This made Zhou Wen suspect that Chick’s phoenix bloodline wasn’t very pure.</p>
<p>Could it be that a real phoenix actually looks like a pheasant? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>The pheasant constantly attacked Zhou Wen, seemingly determined to kill him personally.</p>
<p>Although the golden-winged bird had no intention of attacking Zhou Wen after being reprimanded by the pheasant, it kept eyeing him covetously.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, if the pheasant suffered any damage, it would immediately rush over and tear Zhou Wen to pieces.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it’s time to use Great Brahma’s true strength. I don’t care if you are a true phoenix. I’ll kill you first. Don’t say that I didn’t give you a chance. You were the one who insisted on courting death. The Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra in Zhou Wen’s body circulated crazily as the Great Brahma armor over his body became even more mysterious. The black hole halo wheel behind him didn’t change, but it seemed to be devouring everything nearby.</p>
<p>“All life is equal…” Zhou Wen stood in the garden like a Buddha. Faced with the pheasant’s pecking, he slowly closed his eyes and chanted like a Buddha.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1720'>Chapter 1720 All Life is Equal</h3>
<p>The pheasant was accustomed to having the final say at Kunlun Mountain. It pecked down without any regard for anything.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s eyes remained closed, but it was as though he had already expected the pheasant’s attack trajectory. He raised his palm slightly and extended a finger, blocking the pheasant’s beak.</p>
<p>At the instant the two came into contact, the wheel of light behind Zhou Wen was like a true black hole that instantly devoured everything</p>
<p>The man and pheasant didn’t seem to change, but their surroundings had become extremely strange.</p>
<p>The garden that was inches away vanished. The grass, flowers, and trees vanished as well. The golden-winged bird that was eyeing them covetously also vanished. It was as though Zhou Wen and the pheasant were the only ones left in the world. Everything around them was an empty darkness.</p>
<p>The pheasant was slightly stunned as it looked around, seemingly puzzled.</p>
<p>“All life is equal except for one life.” Zhou Wen’s eyes remained closed as he walked towards the pheasant.</p>
<p>The true power of Great Brahma’s domain was naturally not as simple as having powerful destructive power. This was the true power of Great Brahma’s domain.</p>
<p>In Great Brahma’s domain, all powers and life were isolated. Only the creatures that Zhou Wen pulled into Great Brahma’s domain could touch Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>Any creature outside Great Brahma’s domain, even someone as powerful as the golden-winged bird, could only see an illusion without touching anything inside.</p>
<p>Unless the creature locked onto by Great Brahma’s domain died or Great Brahma’s domain was defeated, no external force could affect Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The golden-winged bird noticed the anomaly and let out an angry cry. Its wings slashed at Zhou Wen with a terrifying golden light.</p>
<p>However, the golden light that could slice through everything seemed to slash at an illusion. No matter how many times it slashed at Zhou Wen’s body, it couldn’t injure him at all. The two seemed to be in two completely different spaces.</p>
<p>The pheasant remained as belligerent as before as it transformed into a white beam and charged at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already filled with killing intent, but it didn’t show on his face. He was as calm as Buddha. His body moved slightly as he dodged the pheasant’s pecking. At the same time, he threw a punch at the pheasant’s abdomen.</p>
<p>The pheasant flapped its wings and instantly leaped into the air, dodging Zhou Wen’s fist. At the same time, its hook-like claws reached out for Zhou Wen’s eyes.</p>
<p>Great Brahma only had one face and a pair of arms left under the armor, but this didn’t mean that the other abilities had vanished. They had only been fused into this face.</p>
<p>Faced with the pheasant’s claw attack, Zhou Wen’s speed was too slow to dodge or block. He had no intention of dodging or blocking as he used his helm to block the pheasant’s indomitable claw attack.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The indomitable claw grabbed the dark-gold helm, but it failed to penetrate it. It didn’t even make Zhou Wen take a step back. Instead, it let out a tragic cry as it flew backward as though it had suffered a heavy blow.</p>
<p>Great Brahma also had the ability to reflect damage. After fusing all four sides, this ability became even stronger.</p>
<p>Looking at the pheasant that flew out, Zhou Wen tore through the void and instantly arrived in front of it. He punched it repeatedly like a storm.</p>
<p>Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!</p>
<p>The pheasant suffered continuous attacks as its body staggered from the impact, distorting in the air.</p>
<p>It had to be said that the pheasant’s body was extremely powerful. Typical Calamity-grade creatures would have long been shattered by such a destructive force.</p>
<p>However, the pheasant only let out tragic cries. Feathers were constantly sent flying, but it didn’t suffer a fatal blow, nor did it lose its combat strength.</p>
<p>It even reached out its claws and beak to counterattack during the gap between Zhou Wen’s attacks. However, when its attacks landed on Zhou Wen, it ended up being injured.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen crazily attack the pheasant, sending its feathers flying everywhere, the golden-winged bird outside cried out angrily. The golden light on its body erupted like a volcano as it slashed at Zhou Wen’s figure again and again.</p>
<p>However, such a terrifying attack was completely useless. It could clearly see Zhou Wen, but all its forces passed through him. It was as though he was a mirage. No matter how destructive the golden-winged bird’s power was, it was useless against Zhou Wen while he was inside Great Brahma’s domain. All it could do was panic outside.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if you are a phoenix or a pheasant. Even if you are the Son of the Universe, you are only a living creature. You only have one life. Fight with your life on the line; there’s only you and me.” Zhou Wen punched the pheasant again and again. The strikes weren’t fatal, but made the pheasant scream repeatedly as its feathers constantly tore apart.</p>
<p>The pheasant’s body, which was originally covered by white feathers, had golden skin exposed in many places. The skin was crystalline like gold crystal, as though there was a rainbow luster flowing within.</p>
<p>After suffering such ferocious blows, although the pheasant kept screaming, it became more ferocious. The rainbow-colored glow in its body intensified.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that the pheasant only knew simple offensive techniques like pecking and claw strikes. They were far inferior to Zhou Wen’s rich techniques, but with the passage of time, the pheasant’s techniques became more varied.</p>
<p>In fact, no technique Zhou Wen used could injure the pheasant a second time.</p>
<p>If it were an ordinary Calamity-grade creature, they would have long been out of options and wouldn’t be able to injure the pheasant at all.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s combat techniques appeared infinite in number. A seemingly simple punch contained infinite variations, making it difficult for the pheasant to predict his attack trajectory. In terms of strength, Zhou Wen might not be the strongest on Earth, but in terms of combat realm and techniques, no one on Earth was his match.</p>
<p>Ignoring the infinite variations of the three thousand sword intents, just the Small Perfection of Wisdom realm was enough to turn Zhou Wen into something magical. It was as though a simple move would become unpredictable and unfathomable in Zhou Wen’s hands.</p>
<p>The pheasant was constantly struck. Its feathers flew in the sky.</p>
<p>Yi!</p>
<p>Just as it was about to turn into a bald chicken, the pheasant suddenly let out a strange cry. The rainbow-colored light in its body tore out and its entire body was enveloped by strange colors.</p>
<p>The body that was about to turn bald instantly transformed into rainbow feathers that covered its body again.</p>
<p>Not only that, but its body also underwent an inexplicable change. The feathers on its head and back grew longer and longer as they danced like immortal clouds.</p>
<p>The rainbow feathers on its body spread out in the wind. After it spread its wings, the rainbow-colored glass-like luster rose and danced, swirling around its body like immortal clouds.</p>
<p>At that moment, the pheasant no longer looked like a pheasant. It was clearly a rainbow phoenix surrounded by an immortal aura.</p>

<h3 id='chapter1721'>Chapter 1721 Rainbow Phoenix</h3>
<p>This is a phoenix? Why doesn’t it look as orthodox as Chick? Zhou Wen saw that the phoenix was colorful and beautiful, but due to its beauty, it lacked its domineeringness.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s impression of a phoenix was a bird covered in golden flames-domineering and noble.</p>
<p>Although such a gorgeous creature looked like a phoenix, it still left Zhou Wen somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>Having been bullied for so long, the pheasant was already enraged. At that moment, it transformed into a rainbow phoenix and spat out rainbow-like flames.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen condensed the power of Great Brahma and punched the rainbow flames.</p>
<p>Great Brahma’s power seldom encountered a nemesis. Its destructive power was extremely powerful, but when it encountered the rainbow flames, it lost the destructive power it should have—it was forcefully disintegrated by the rainbow flames.</p>
<p>What kind of flame is this? It can actually restrain Great Brahma’s power! Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly instant transmitted to dodge the burning of the rainbow flames.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother.” Zhou Wen was fighting the rainbow phoenix when he suddenly heard Liu Yun’s voice.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you flee? Why are you back?” Zhou Wen heard the voice, but he didn’t see Liu Yun. He didn’t know where he had hidden, nor did he have the time to find his location.</p>
<p>“What do you mean ‘flee?’ I went to get the cavalry for you,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“Where’s your cavalry?” Zhou Wen asked as he fought. “I haven’t found one, so be careful. I think the bird you’re fighting is most likely a phoenix.” Liu Yun paused before continuing, “Don’t think that phoenixes only spew fire. In ancient myths and legends, phoenixes are actually an extremely terrifying existence. This phoenix is probably the kind of phoenix in ancient myths. It has terrifying might.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to speak to him. Great Brahma’s powers were restrained, and his speed was inferior to the phoenix’s. All he could do was rely on his techniques to fight the rainbow phoenix, but he was already at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>“Have you heard of the legend of phoenixes giving birth to Rocs and Peacocks?” Liu Yun continued transmitting his voice.</p>
<p>“Cut the crap. Tell me something useful.” Zhou Wen really wasn’t in the mood to listen to his stories. Great Brahma’s powers were restrained, making his combat a challenge.</p>
<p>“From what I see, your strength seems to be somewhat similar to the Buddhist pantheon. Back then, the Peacock Bright King was able to devour Buddha, so it’s obvious that the Peacock’s strength has a restraining effect on the Buddhist pantheon. As for the phoenix, it’s the peacock’s ancestor. Its strength will restrain you. You can try fighting it with a different type of power. Perhaps it will be better,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. He naturally knew that any other type of power might not be restrained, but he had to have one to change.</p>
<p>Only Great Brahma was at the Heaven level. The powers below the Heaven level couldn’t touch the phoenix. Truth Listener hadn’t completed its mutation, so it couldn’t be summoned.</p>
<p>“Can’t you say something useful?” Zhou Wen couldn’t dodge in time and the rainbow flames were about to burn him.</p>
<p>His vision blurred as he realized that he had been moved far away, dodging the rainbow phoenix’s attack.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen recall that the grass fruit baby was still lying on his shoulder. It had escaped with Zhou Wen, allowing him to dodge the rainbow flames.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll forgive you for being uneducated. Have you heard of a mythical peacock that knows the Five-colored Divine Light? I reckon this phoenix’s rainbow flames are even more terrifying than the Five-colored Divine Light. It’s best if you don’t touch it,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wish to be tainted by the rainbow flames. If it could even disintegrate the power of Great Brahma, death was almost a certainty if he touched it.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the grass fruit baby provided sufficient help. As long as Zhou Wen encountered danger, this fellow would use an escape technique to escape with him. It was very obedient.</p>
<p>I don’t care anymore. If it benefits, so be it. Zhou Wen knew that this couldn’t continue.</p>
<p>The rainbow phoenix was much faster than him while Great Brahma was restrained by the rainbow flames; he had to think of other solutions.</p>
<p>He simultaneously circulated Great Brahma and the Chaos Egg. Just as the Chaos Egg protected Zhou Wen’s body, the rainbow flames enveloped the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Chaos Egg wasn’t burned through as Zhou Wen expected. However, Essence Energy Crystals were produced crazily, almost bursting the egg instantaneously. Zhou Wen got Imperial Lord Behemoth to absorb Essence Energy Crystals, but it was only a drop in the ocean. Thankfully, the grass fruit baby didn’t disappoint him. It opened its mouth and instantly absorbed most of the Essence Energy Crystals.</p>
<p>The red light in its body became brighter and brighter, like a crystal chandelier.</p>
<p>Although what Liu Yun said is a little far-fetched, it’s not completely impossible. If a phoenix can give birth to a peacock and a roc, then there’s no reason why a phoenix can’t have the abilities of a peacock and a roc. The Golden-Winged Roc’s speed is unparalleled, and the mythical peacock does have Five-colored Divine Light. This phoenix has the speed of a roc and the peacock’s Five-colored Divine Light. Furthermore, it’s an upgraded version. It probably won’t be easy to kill. If Truth Listener is around, it shouldn’t be difficult for me to find an opportunity by joining forces with it… Zhou Wen wasn’t worried about the Chaos Egg exploding for the time being. He carefully observed the rainbow phoenix, hoping to find its weakness.</p>
<p>The Teacher Domain analyzed the rainbow phoenix’s trajectory again and again, but the analysis was very slow. It was unknown how long it would take to completely analyze it.</p>
<p>After the grass fruit baby absorbed the crystals for a period of time, the red light in its body gradually dimmed, turning into a red heart that appeared in its chest. The grass fruit baby’s body gradually returned to its original appearance after the heart completely solidified. It was no longer as transparent as before.</p>
<p>When the baby completely recovered, it stopped absorbing Essence Energy Crystals.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately given a fright. The Chaos Egg had lasted all this time thanks to the grass fruit baby’s absorption of the Essence Energy Crystal. Otherwise, the Chaos Egg probably wouldn’t have lasted two seconds under the rainbow flames.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the blink of an eye, the Chaos Egg was pushed to its limits. Imperial Lord Behemoth couldn’t absorb much, so just as it was about to explode</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg failed to hold on and exploded. Zhou Wen’s body was immediately exposed. Thankfully, he used spatial instant transmission to leave his previous spot without touching the rainbow flames.</p>
<p>“Little brat, don’t just eat and do nothing. Haven’t you already completed your evolution? Quickly beat up that crappy bird.” Zhou Wen was still counting on the grass fruit baby to fight the phoenix, so he could take the opportunity to escape.</p>
<p>However, the grass fruit baby lay on Zhou Wen’s back without any intention of fighting. It was unknown if it had a good temper, had no intention of taking revenge, or if it knew that its strength was inferior to the rainbow phoenix, making it afraid of fighting it.</p>
<p>Just as he was feeling depressed, he suddenly realized that something was amiss with the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>In the past, after the Chaos Egg exploded, its foundation would be damaged. It would take some time to condense it again. Yet, after the Chaos Egg exploded, Zhou Wen didn’t sense any damage to its foundation. It was as though he could continue using the Chaos Egg</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gave it a try and indeed, the Chaos Egg appeared around him again.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1722'>Chapter 1722 Chaos Heaven Level</h3>
<p>Why can the Chaos Egg suddenly be used continuously? Zhou Wen knew that something had definitely happened to the Chaos Egg, but he wasn’t sure what caused the change.</p>
<p>Such a change was definitely related to the use of the Chaos Egg. Between the rainbow phoenix and the grass fruit baby, one of them had definitely affected the Chaos Egg; Zhou Wen was more inclined to the former.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen made another attempt. He could immediately use the Chaos Egg after it exploded. He didn’t need to wait like before.</p>
<p>This is a little strange. The Chaos Egg clearly hasn’t advanced to the Heaven Realm, but it’s very different from before. What’s going on? Zhou Wen carefully sensed the Chaos Egg’s every shattering and rebirth. He increasingly felt that the changes in the Chaos Egg were related to the rainbow phoenix.</p>
<p>Or rather, it was related to the rainbow flames. The Chaos Egg underwent such a change after being burned by the rainbow flames.</p>
<p>Previously, the Chaos Egg exploded countless times, but there weren’t any special changes. Now, there’s actually such a change. Could it be that this rainbow phoenix is really different? Then, if this continues, will the Chaos Egg have a chance of advancing to the Heaven Realm? Zhou Wen’s mind stirred.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg hadn’t changed for a long time. Now that he finally saw the opportunity to advance it to the Heaven Realm, Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t let it go.</p>
<p>It was only because Zhou Wen had many life-preservation means. Anyone else would be eager to escape; they wouldn’t have such thoughts in a battle of such magnitude.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg exploded again and again. Zhou Wen could clearly sense that the Chaos Egg that hadn’t stirred for a long time had finally undergone a clear change.</p>
<p>It really works! Zhou Wen was overjoyed.</p>
<p>was</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, aren’t you going to escape? What are you waiting for?” Liu Yun’s voice sounded again. It was obvious that he was puzzled.</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother, didn’t you say that the sword was protected by a phoenix? Is that phoenix the same one as this?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“They are all rainbow colors, but it seems a little different. It’s definitely not the same one. Furthermore, that phoenix has always been rainbow-colored. It’s unlike this phoenix which was a pheasant in the beginning,” Liu Yun answered.</p>
<p>“Does that mean that as long as I can deal with this phoenix, it shouldn’t be difficult to retrieve the sword?” Although Zhou Wen said that, his thoughts were somewhat different.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t too concerned about getting the sword. He was considering whether he should try his luck with the other phoenix if this phoenix’s rainbow flames couldn’t advance the Chaos Egg to the Heaven level.</p>
<p>“What are you thinking? There might still be some hope if you manage to get Human Sovereign’s Companion Beast; otherwise, stop dreaming,” Liu Yun probed.</p>
<p>“That might not be the case.” Zhou Wen thought to himself, Truth Listener’s offensive strength is indeed powerful, but the Chaos Egg’s defense isn’t weak either. If it can advance to the Heaven level, it might be able to withstand the rainbow phoenix’s flames.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else. When Liu Yun saw the Chaos Egg explode again and again, he imagined that Zhou Wen was just being stubborn. He continued, “Hold on a little longer. I’ve already contacted the old fellow. When he comes, he might have a way to help you escape.”</p>
<p>“Jing Daoxian has already reached the Heaven level?” Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed.</p>
<p>“No, but the old fellow has many solutions. There are some things that we can’t do, but he has a way to resolve them. We have to accept this. The old dogs hunt the best,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen believed him-a person like Jing Daoxian couldn’t be measured by his level.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen wanted to know what level Jing Daoxian was at, it wasn’t appropriate to ask Liu Yun. After all, he and Jing Daoxian might be enemies in the future. Getting Liu Yun to betray his own kin wasn’t something Zhou Wen could bring himself to do, even if Liu Yun was willing to say.</p>
<p>“Why isn’t the old fellow here yet?” Liu Yun was somewhat worried that Zhou Wen wouldn’t be able to last long when he saw the Chaos Egg crack again and again. However, he hadn’t received a response after sending a message. Jing Daoxian hadn’t appeared either.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s endurance far exceeded Liu Yun’s expectations. Every time Liu Yun felt that Zhou Wen couldn’t last much longer, the latter proved him wrong.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was almost numb towards the end.</p>
<p>I wonder what Essence Energy Art this junior brother of mine cultivates in. Why are there so many strange abilities? How many Essence Energy Arts has he cultivated? Liu Yun guessed inwardly.</p>
<p>Typically, people would only cultivate one Essence Energy Art. Humans who could cultivate two Essence Energy Arts at the same time were already rare.</p>
<p>However, with Liu Yun’s understanding of Zhou Wen, the latter definitely had more than two Essence Energy Arts.</p>
<p>If I didn’t know that it was impossible for this fellow to join the dimension, I would have thought that he had long betrayed his humanity. It’s unbelievable that a pure human can do this… Liu Yun actually suspected that Zhou Wen was no longer human like Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it would be almost impossible for others to advance to the Mythical stage by cultivating two Essence Energy Arts-even if they used a Mythical Serum. Yet, Zhou Wen was already at the Calamity grade. Furthermore, he used far more than two Essence Energy Arts.</p>
<p>After the Chaos Egg shattered countless times, Zhou Wen finally felt that it had reached a critical point. It didn’t stir much as though success was a matter of course. When the Chaos Egg was summoned again, it had already advanced to the Heaven level and was somewhat different from before.</p>
<p>The Heaven level! Zhou Wen looked at the Chaos Egg, eager to know what changes the Heaven-level Chaos Egg had undergone.</p>
<p>The greatest possibility was that the stacking of Essence Energy Crystals increased, but when the rainbow flames burned over, Zhou Wen realized that the stacking numbers of Essence Energy Crystals didn’t change. They were still in the hundreds of millions, so there was no way to continue stacking them.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised to discover a large number of Essence Energy Crystals appear in the Chaos Egg. The Chaos Egg would have exploded in the past, but now, with so many Essence Energy Crystals inside, it didn’t feel crowded at all.</p>
<p>The space inside the Chaos Egg has expanded! No, it’s not as simple as having expanded!</p>
<p>The rainbow flames constantly burned the Chaos Egg. The number of Essence Energy Crystals inside the Chaos Egg was uncountable, but despite the space being limited, it didn’t pile up.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg stopped shattering. After a while, he suddenly heard Liu Yun’s voice again. Furthermore, his emotions seemed rather unstable.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, don’t tell me that you planned on using the phoenix to cultivate from the beginning?” Liu Yun shouted. He could now tell that the Chaos Egg had advanced.</p>
<p>“No, I just did some last-minute training,” Zhou Wen said truthfully.</p>
<p>Liu Yun fell silent. After a while, he heard Liu Yun say through gritted teeth, “Freak!”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1723'>Chapter 1723 Canyon</h3>
<p>The Heaven-level Chaos Egg still didn’t have any offensive abilities, but its defense became unimaginably powerful. Even the strange power of the rainbow flames couldn’t cause any substantial damage to the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the Chaos Egg is purely a defensive Essence Energy Art. It would be even better if it had some offensive strength, Zhou Wen thought greedily.</p>
<p>With the Heaven-level Chaos Egg protecting him, the rainbow flames couldn’t harm Zhou Wen anymore. Instead, the number of Essence Energy Crystals in the Chaos Egg reached an astronomical number. It benefited a gluttonous Companion Beast like Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>After all, Essence Energy Crystals were useless. Zhou Wen got the Companion Beasts that could absorb Essence Energy Crystals to absorb them as best they could. Imperial Lord Behemoth’s crazy devouring made it advance to the Hell level. As long as there was enough time, it was only a matter of time before it advanced to the Heaven level.</p>
<p>It’s easier to rear a Companion Beast like Imperial Lord Behemoth. As long as there’s food, it can advance. If others knew of Zhou Wen’s thoughts, they would probably vomit blood.</p>
<p>If it were an ordinary person raising Imperial Lord Behemoth, not having it starve to death would be amazing enough. Advancing to the Calamity grade was an extravagant hope.</p>
<p>Explosive Fiend Man had also swallowed quite a number of Essence Energy Crystals and it came close to advancing to the Calamity grade -it was one of the few Companion Beasts that could advance to the Calamity grade with Essence Energy Crystals.</p>
<p>“Bro, stop fooling around. We need to gonow. The immortal sword over there isn’t waiting for anyone. If it’s really taken by the Immortals, it would be too late for regrets,” Liu Yun said gloomily.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen really wanted to stay here and use the rainbow flames to raise his Companion Beasts—where raising Imperial Lord Behemoth to the Heaven level was the best possible outcome before leaving-he gave up after some thought.</p>
<p>Since there was already a solution and the dungeon had been successfully downloaded, there were plenty of opportunities in the future. He might not stand another chance with that sword in the future.</p>
<p>Things like the Immortal Culling Sword might not exist in-game. It was useless even if he downloaded the dungeon.</p>
<p>If that sword was really a set with the Immortal Culling Sword, it was better to have it in his hands than have the Immortals possess it.</p>
<p>If it were in the past, Zhou Wen might have been somewhat hesitant, unwilling to take the risk in such a dangerous place. Now that the Chaos Egg had advanced to the Heaven level, his worries were greatly reduced.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.” Zhou Wen stopped fighting the rainbow phoenix and charged into the stone chamber against the rainbow flames.</p>
<p>The rainbow phoenix indignantly spewed fire at Zhou Wen as it chased after him, eager to burn him to ashes. Unfortunately, it could only watch as Zhou Wen rushed into the stone chamber and entered the pit.</p>
<p>The golden-winged bird cried out angrily, but unfortunately, it couldn’t touch Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>It was unknown if the rainbow phoenix and the golden-winged bird refused to enter because they disdained the pit for being a toilet or if there was some other reason, but they didn’t chase after them.</p>
<p>“Go back.” Seeing the rainbow phoenix cease its pursuit, he dispelled the Chaos Egg in the tunnel and planned on letting the grass fruit baby return alone.</p>
<p>Although this thing was magical, it involved too many variables. It wasn’t under Zhou Wen’s control, so it might be troublesome to take it back.</p>
<p>Furthermore, ordinary Calamity creatures couldn’t randomly leave dimensional zones. It wasn’t easy for creatures to break out of the dimensional zones.</p>
<p>It wasn’t difficult to break out of ordinary dimensional zones, but it wasn’t that simple to break out of a dimensional zone like Kunlun.</p>
<p>The grass fruit baby sat on Zhou Wen’s shoulder, but it didn’t seem to hear him. It remained motionless as it looked at Zhou Wen with an innocent expression.</p>
<p>“Go back to where you come from.” Zhou Wen pointed inside.</p>
<p>The grass fruit baby remained motionless as though it didn’t understand what Zhou Wen was saying</p>
<p>Forget it. It will naturally return at the exit when it realizes it can’t leave. Zhou Wen continued heading for the exit.</p>
<p>To his surprise, after Zhou Wen stepped out the exit, the grass fruit baby followed him out of the Kunlun Mountain dimensional zone without any obstruction.</p>
<p>“You’re finally out!” Liu Yun was already waiting outside. He heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Zhou Wen come out.</p>
<p>“Where’s your grandfather?” Zhou Wen looked around and didn’t see Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>“Don’t mention it. There wasn’t any response after I sent the message. I don’t know where he went.” Liu Yun shrugged and continued, “Let’s not talk about this for now. We are far behind schedule. I don’t know if we can make it now.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go.” Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else as he turned around and headed for the pool.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to deal with this thing first?” Liu Yun pointed at the grass fruit baby on Zhou Wen’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Going to such a dangerous place with such an unknown item was equivalent to carrying a time bomb. Who knew when something would happen?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at the grass fruit baby and pondered for a moment before shaking his head. “Forget it. Let’s talk when we get there.”</p>
<p>Liu Yun didn’t say anything else as the two of them headed for the entrance to the pool.</p>
<p>The entrance to the pool was beneath the pool’s surface. At the end of the underground river-like waterway was a bigger pool. One could still hear rumbling sounds.</p>
<p>Before surfacing, Zhou Wen first used the Teacher Domain to scan the nearby area and realized that this place was completely different from the place they had entered.</p>
<p>This was a huge canyon. They were under a waterfall that was probably ten thousand feet tall. The cascading water was like a roaring white dragon hanging from the mountain wall. It looked extremely spectacular.</p>
<p>However, they didn’t find the phoenix or immortal sword that Liu Yun had mentioned. There was flowing water in the canyon, and there were plenty of fungi growing on the cliffs on both sides. The big ones were almost like houses, and the small ones were about the size of millstones. They stacked on the stone walls and looked like circular roofs.</p>
<p>The fungi were colorful and beautiful. The entire canyon appeared to be a fairyland.</p>
<p>“Be careful. The spores emitted by these mushrooms are everywhere. If you accidentally breathe them in, they will parasitize your body and suck dry your flesh and blood as nutrients…” Liu Yun knew that Zhou Wen’s eyesight had reached a microscopic level and could see the spores, but he still warned him.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me there are dimensional creatures like the Ganoderma Baby here?” Zhou Wen remembered reading on the Internet that someone had obtained a Ganoderma Baby Companion Beast that had extremely powerful recovery skills. Typical injuries could be instantly healed.</p>
<p>It was said that it had the ability to resurrect the dead. As long as a person was still breathing, no matter how serious their injuries were, they could be treated. However, that ability seemed to require sacrificing the Ganoderma Companion Beast. Even so, it was already very enviable. Zhou Wen had long wanted to get one, but it was too rare. He couldn’t buy it, nor did he know which dimensional zone it came from.</p>
<p>“I didn’t hear the old man mention that there’s such a thing. He only told me that the spores here are very terrifying. We mustn’t let them enter our bodies,” Liu Yun said after some thought.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s words reminded Zhou Wen of a Companion Beast of his.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1724'>Chapter 1724 Phoenix</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen hadn’t found a suitable way to evolve Primordial Spore after turning it into an Evolvable Companion Beast.</p>
<p>In the past, Primordial Spore had once devoured other types of spores to evolve. Now that there were spores everywhere in the canyon, it was unknown if Primordial Spore could do the same by devouring them.</p>
<p>However, Primordial Spore’s level was too low. Zhou Wen was afraid that it would end up being devoured, so he didn’t dare rashly attempt it. He planned on experimenting in-game in the future.</p>
<p>“The immortal sword is at the end of the canyon. We have to rush over as quickly as possible. Don’t use spatial teleportation here, nor do you have to fly too quickly. Follow me.” As Liu Yun spoke, he leaped into the air and slowly flew towards one end of the canyon. “Why can’t I fly too quickly?” Zhou Wen could understand not being able to use spatial teleportation.</p>
<p>There were spores everywhere. If he used spatial teleportation to teleport, his body might very well bump into the spores when he phased into existence. It was equivalent to him taking the initiative to inject spores into his body. That was equivalent to courting death.</p>
<p>“There are too many spores—if we fly too quickly, it will attract a large number of spores to attach to us. Don’t think that it’s easy to ward them off. It will be different if there are more. Anyway, it’s very dangerous here. It’s more reliable for us to follow the old man’s method,” Liu Yun explained.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded and slowly flew behind Liu</p>
<p>Yun.</p>
<p>A lone peak tore through the clouds-a somewhat strange mountain peak.</p>
<p>Typical mountain peaks were narrow at the top and wide at the bottom. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to withstand the pressure from the mountain rocks and would easily collapse. However, this mountain peak was narrow at the bottom, wide at the bottom. It looked like a strange fusiform that stood at the end of the canyon. From afar, it looked like it would collapse at any moment.</p>
<p>vas narro</p>
<p>Beneath this strange mountain peak, a man and a woman were looking up.</p>
<p>“Immortal Supremacy, that immortal sword is embedded on the mountaintop. However, there’s a phoenix resting on this mountain. Once one approaches the mountain peak, they will be attacked by the phoenix. I can only send you to this point,” Wang Mingyuan said neither obsequiously nor superciliously as he stood behind the woman.</p>
<p>The woman stared at the mountain for a long time before saying, “You speak the truth. The immortal sword is indeed on the mountaintop, protected by a phoenix.”</p>
<p>“How would I dare lie to you, Immortal Supremacy?” Wang Mingyuan said.</p>
<p>“However, since I’m here, just follow me up the mountain. Although a phoenix is an ancient divine creature, it can’t injure you at all with me around,” the woman said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Immortal Supremacy, according to the agreement, I’m only responsible for taking you to the immortal sword. Furthermore, with my meager combat abilities, I’ll only bring trouble by following you. I won’t be of much help.” Wang Mingyuan naturally didn’t wish to follow the woman up the mountain.</p>
<p>The woman said calmly, “Everyone knows that phoenixes have five colors. Mortals view dragons as emperors, while phoenixes are the concubines or empress. However, they don’t know that at the beginning of the chaos, the Yin and Yang transformed into dragons and phoenixes. That’s a true phoenix.”</p>
<p>After a pause, the woman continued, “Before humans were born, dragons and phoenixes dominated the world. There was a huge battle that nearly tore the world apart. Do you know who the final victor was?”</p>
<p>“I’ve only heard of the Dragon-Phoenix calamity, but I don’t know who won in the end. However, if I were to guess, it should be the phoenixes which clinched the final victory,” Wang Mingyuan said.</p>
<p>“For the Buddha race to employ you in such an important position is indeed not without reason.” The woman glanced at Wang Mingyuan and continued, “The dragon is Yin, and the phoenix is Yang. The phoenix indeed clinched final victory in the battle between the dragons and phoenixes. Although it was a Pyrrhic victory and it injured its own kind, it ultimately obtained the dragon’s Yin. Only by fusing Yin and Yang could it be called a phoenix. Mortals treat dragons as an emperor and think of them as a pure Yang body, but in fact, it’s just inaccurate. How can such a blasphemous thing be a pure Yang body?”</p>
<p>“However, after the Dragon-Phoenix calamity, the phoenix was severely injured and had to recluse itself from the world. The phoenixes that mortals later saw were only transformed from ordinary birds that obtained a little of the phoenix’s blood. The phoenix bloodline that truly inherited chaos has seven colors. The rainbow-colored Yin Yang divine light can ward off the sun and moon. How can those so-called phoenix flames compare?”</p>
<p>As the woman spoke, she retracted her gaze from the mountain peak and looked at Wang Mingyuan. “In the legends of you humans, there’s the legend of a phoenix giving birth to a Golden-Winged Roc and a Peacock. Although such legends have many flaws, there’s one thing that’s right. The abilities of the Golden-Winged Roc and Peacock do come from the phoenix, but they haven’t completely obtained its essence.”</p>
<p>“I’ve also heard that peacocks have Five-colored Divine Light. I believe it comes from the phoenix, right?” Wang Mingyuan said.</p>
<p>“It’s not wrong, but the Five-colored Divine Light is naturally much inferior to the phoenix’s Rainbow Divine Light,” the woman said indifferently. “However, the present phoenix has ultimately damaged its foundation. It will be difficult for it to recover its former glory. Furthermore, the phoenix here can’t be the one born from the Chaos. It’s just a descendant of its linege. It can only be considered a mortal creature if it hasn’t entered the Apocalypse grade. Just go up. With me around, it can’t injure you at all.”</p>
<p>With the woman already saying so much. Wang Mingyuan knew that he had to accompany her up. All he could do was nod and say, “I’ll obey your orders, Immortal Supremacy.”</p>
<p>The woman didn’t say anything else as she walked towards the strange mountain peak. Wang Mingyuan followed behind her and stared at the mountain peak without any change in expression.</p>
<p>However, Wang Mingyuan was secretly puzzled. I got her to enter through the north gate and took such a long detour. Why haven’t Liu Yun and Zhou Wen arrived? Could something have happened?</p>
<p>Although Wang Mingyuan was puzzled, his expression remained stoic as he followed the woman onto the mountain.</p>
<p>Just as the two of them reached the top of the mountain, they heard a phoenix cry that stirred the clouds. A rainbow beam tore down from the mountaintop like a rainbow that streaked down from the sky and flew towards them.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen were here, he would definitely be familiar with the Rainbow Divine Light. Inside the Rainbow Divine Light was a rainbow phoenix. The glow around it was identical to the rainbow flames Zhou Wen had</p>
<p>seen.</p>
<p>However, the Rainbow Divine Light of the rainbow phoenix was purer and thicker than the rainbow flames of the one in the garden. It was impossible to tell its original form through the flames. All one could see was the resplendent colors of light.</p>
<p>The woman showed no intention of dodging when she saw the Rainbow Divine Light shoot toward her. With a slight pull of her slender hand, her index and middle fingers transformed into a sword stance as she pointed at the Rainbow Divine Light.</p>
<p>An invisible sword beam-formless and colorless—tore out of her finger. The intent of the sword aura made one feel as though a sharp sword was rising against the night sky to meet the Rainbow Divine Light.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1725'>Chapter 1725 Nihility Sword Aura</h3>
<p>The sword beam collided with the Rainbow Divine Light, but it didn’t produce any sound. The two forces intertwined strangely like two ropes.</p>
<p>The woman stood at the foot of the mountain as the phoenix soared halfway up the mountain. The tug-of-war seemed to be in a stalemate.</p>
<p>It didn’t seem like a tense situation, but it was actually a dire situation that could throw one into complete danger at any moment.</p>
<p>When two forces intertwined, any force that was slightly weaker would immediately suffer the backlash from both forces. Therefore, they could only constantly squeeze out whatever was left of their strength to resist the other party to the end, not daring to relax at all.</p>
<p>“The phoenix is already under my control. Kill it,” the woman suddenly said indifferently to Wang Mingyuan as she fought the phoenix.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan frowned slightly. For the woman to make him take action now, it could be said that she was scheming.</p>
<p>If she was powerless to kill the phoenix and needed Wang Mingyuan to determine victory, it would be the best opportunity to kill her if Wang Mingyuan were to turn against her.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, this might also be a test for Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>However, who could guarantee that she didn’t really have any strength left? If Wang Mingyuan really had ulterior motives, he would probably miss a great opportunity.</p>
<p>If it were anyone else, they might have hesitated, but Wang Mingyuan didn’t hesitate at all. He used his palm as a blade and condensed an ice-like blade beam that slashed at the phoenix in midair.</p>
<p>The phoenix was unable to dodge due to the woman’s restraints. When the blade beam slashed at its body, it was like a sharp blade slicing through flesh. It was split into two.</p>
<p>The Rainbow Divine Light dissipated as the phoenix’s body exploded in all directions. However, in the next second, the scattered rainbow streams gathered together again and instantly transformed back into the phoenix.</p>
<p>The phoenix spread its wings as the rainbow feathers on its body emitted divine light. Like a rainbow sun, the light radiated in all directions.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan quickly retreated like a ghost, but his speed wasn’t as fast as the Rainbow Divine Light. Seeing that he was about to be injured by it, he had no choice but to condense the power of ice and lightning to resist it.</p>
<p>However, the moment the light of ice and lightning touched the Rainbow Divine Light, it immediately disintegrated. It couldn’t even resist for a moment.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan had already tried his best to retreat, but he couldn’t escape the brilliance of the Rainbow Divine Light. The armor on his body instantly melted as though it wasn’t hard armor but snow.</p>
<p>The snow-white skin and muscles beneath the armor melted the moment they came into contact with the Rainbow Divine Light. In the blink of an eye, white bones could be seen.</p>
<p>Just as Wang Mingyuan’s body was about to be completely enveloped by the Rainbow Divine Light, an invisible force seemed to separate his body from it, forming a clear barrier.</p>
<p>The woman emitted infinite sword beams. The invisible and colorless sword beams were so dense that even a needle tip couldn’t pierce them. They forcefully blocked the Rainbow Divine Light.</p>
<p>“The Yin-Yang Rainbow Divine Light can disintegrate many things, but my Nihility Sword Aura isn’t one of them,” the woman said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Immortal Supremacy is indeed extraordinary.” Wang Mingyuan looked down at his chest. His flesh had already melted, revealing his sternum. He could even see the beating heart inside.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about anything and focus on treating your injuries,” the woman said before ignoring Wang Mingyuan. She stared at the phoenix as the sword intent on her body became increasingly ethereal.</p>
<p>The Nihility Sword Aura resisted the Yin Yang Rainbow Divine Light and gradually gained the upper hand. The invisible and colorless sword beams forcefully restrained the Rainbow Divine Light. The phoenix let out a cry as the Rainbow Divine Light became brighter, but it was difficult to redeem the situation.</p>
<p>“It’s ultimately not the phoenix from the beginning of the chaos.” The woman sighed and took a step forward. Thousands of sword beams tore through the Rainbow Divine Light and instantly penetrated the phoenix’s body.</p>
<p>The phoenix’s colorful body was instantly diced into specks, but in the next second, the specks of light coalesced into the phoenix’s body again.</p>
<p>As though it knew how powerful the woman was, the phoenix let out a long cry and flew back to the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. Let’s go up the mountain to take a look at that immortal sword.” The woman didn’t chase after the phoenix. She turned to look at Wang Mingyuan and saw that the wound on his chest hadn’t healed. Wang Mingyuan’s healing powers didn’t seem to be of any use against the injury.</p>
<p>There was a faint rainbow glow around the wound, preventing the regeneration and healing of the flesh.</p>
<p>The woman waved her hand and slashed at Wang Mingyuan with an invisible sword beam.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan remained motionless as he allowed the invisible sword beam to slash at him. The sword beam sliced through his injuries again as more blood flowed out.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you dodge?” the woman asked Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>“I’m nobody. If you want me dead, there’s no need to wait until now,” Wang Mingyuan said as he used his healing powers again. This time, his flesh quickly regenerated and the wound healed in a moment.</p>
<p>“That’s right.” With that said, the woman turned around and walked towards the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan followed behind the woman as the two of them headed for the mountaintop.</p>
<p>The phoenix could fly freely on the mountain, but the woman and Wang Mingyuan could only walk up the mountain. Even a powerful existence like the woman couldn’t fly freely on this strange mountain like the phoenix.</p>
<p>Without the phoenix’s obstruction, the two of them quickly arrived at the mountaintop.</p>
<p>There was a grass patch on the mountaintop. In the middle of the lawn stood a stone monument which had a sword completely embedded in it, leaving only its hilt visible.</p>
<p>“The appearance of the sword spells doom for the world, even mighty immortals shall meet peril.” The woman looked at the stone monument and slowly read the words on it. Her expression darkened.</p>
<p>“I wonder which person carved these words. How arrogant,” Wang Mingyuan said.</p>
<p>“Not a person,” the woman said coldly.</p>
<p>“Not a person?” Wang Mingyuan looked at the woman in puzzlement.</p>
<p>The woman didn’t answer this time. With a wave of her hand, the Nihility Sword Aura slashed at the stone monument with the immortal sword embedded in it.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>When the sword beam slashed at the stone monument, one could hear the sound of a blade snapping. The stone monument was completely unharmed. The powerful Nihility Sword Aura that could break through the Rainbow Divine Light failed to leave any marks on the stone monument.</p>
<p>The woman was slightly taken aback as she looked at the stone monument with a frown and muttered quietly, “Do you have so much hate? Even in death, you still insist on being enemies with the Immortals?”</p>
<p>After staring at it for a while, the woman slowly walked towards the stone monument. She stood in front of it and reached out to grab the hilt of the sword. She muttered again, “So what if you have resentment? You are ultimately a part of it. How can you say something like vanquishing the world and immortals? It’s nothing but a joke.”</p>
<p>With that said, the woman used her strength in an attempt to pull the sword out of the stone monument.</p>
<p>As the woman’s infinite strength was injected into the hilt, the entire mountain seemed to tremble. However, the sword remained motionless. It didn’t even budge an inch.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1726'>Chapter 1726 The Path to Immortality Doesn’t Tolerate One Speck of Dust</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen and Liu Yun carefully passed through the canyon and finally stood in front of the strange mountain peak.</p>
<p>“Kunlun is indeed a mysterious place. We couldn’t see such a strange and tall mountain even after walking all this distance. We can only see it when standing at the foot of the mountain. If we fly, I’m afraid we will crash into it,” Liu Yun sighed.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, he suddenly saw the mountain shake.</p>
<p>“Oh no, we’re too late. From the looks of it, the Immortals are already retrieving the sword. What did I say? I told you not to walk around, but you refused to listen. It’s too late for regrets now,” Liu Yun said gloomily.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid the Immortals have yet to retrieve the sword,” Zhou Wen said as he stared at the mountain peak.</p>
<p>“You can see them?” Liu Yun looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Even the best eyes can’t see a hundred meters in such a strange place. How can I see it?” Zhou Wen shook his head.</p>
<p>“Then how do you know that the Immortals failed to retrieve the sword?” Liu Yun asked.</p>
<p>“A man’s intuition.” Zhou Wen didn’t explain as he walked up the mountain.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Liu Yun hurriedly stopped Zhou Wen. “Teacher told us to retrieve the sword before the Immortals come. Now that the Immortals are already retrieving the sword, aren’t you looking for trouble if you go up now?”</p>
<p>“If Teacher really wanted us to retrieve the sword ahead of time, he wouldn’t have informed us so late. I’m afraid he wanted us to meet the Immortals to begin with,” Zhou Wen said as he walked and stepped onto the mountain.</p>
<p>“Then all the more you shouldn’t head up. Despite knowing that it’s a trap, you are still jumping in?” Although Liu Yun said that, he followed.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s a trap or not. I only want that sword. Go back now. I’ll go up and take a look. If things don’t work out, I’ll naturally leave,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Alright. With that turtle shell of yours protecting you, you don’t have to worry about not being able to escape.” Liu Yun stopped in his tracks and didn’t follow Zhou Wen up the mountain, but he had no intention of leaving.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked towards the mountaintop step by step. Liu Yun had told him not to fly on this mountain unless it was absolutely necessary, nor should he use instant transmission abilities.</p>
<p>Liu Yun didn’t know the consequences of using them. Those words had come from Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>On the mountaintop, the woman released her grip on the sword hilt and said to Wang Mingyuan, “Draw the sword.”</p>
<p>“Immortal Supremacy, you must be joking. How can I pull out a sword that you can’t?” Wang Mingyuan said calmly.</p>
<p>“I have my reasons. Just draw the sword,” the woman said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Yes, Immortal Supremacy.” Wang Mingyuan didn’t say anything else. He walked to the stone monument and reached out to grab the hilt. He tried his best to pull the sword out, but it remained motionless.</p>
<p>“Even the body of a human can’t pull it out?” The woman frowned slightly.</p>
<p>“I’m no longer human.” Wang Mingyuan released his hand and retreated to the side.</p>
<p>“Indeed. Then let’s find a pure human to give it a try.” As the woman spoke, she turned to leave the mountain, but when she looked down, she saw a figure approaching from halfway up the mountain.</p>
<p>“Who else knows about this place?” the woman turned her head and asked Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>“I’ve never told anyone about this place since my discovery. It’s not within my means if others had independently discovered this place.” Wang Mingyuan’s expression remained unchanged. He looked as usual as he continued, “If it’s a human, wouldn’t that be great? Immortal Supremacy, you wouldn’t have to go out to find someone.”</p>
<p>The woman couldn’t tell if Wang Mingyuan was lying, so she didn’t ask further. She turned to look at the figure at the foot of the mountain, hoping to confirm who it was.</p>
<p>On this strange mountain peak, the woman’s gaze was greatly affected. She could only see the outline of a figure from afar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s eyesight clearly wasn’t that strong. He didn’t see the woman’s figure when she saw him. By the time he saw the woman on the mountaintop, she could identify him clearly.</p>
<p>“Wang Mingyuan, don’t tell me that there’s such a coincidence in this world. No one else has discovered the secret of Kunlun Mountain, and it just so happens that you and your disciple discovered the same secret.” The woman’s gaze at Wang Mingyuan had already turned cold.</p>
<p>“There are many coincidences in the world. This isn’t strange. I can swear on my soul that I’ve never told this secret to my disciple.” As Wang Mingyuan spoke, he really began making the oath.</p>
<p>When the woman saw that Wang Mingyuan had really sworn a soul oath, she remained unconvinced. However, it was impossible for there to be no reaction from Wang Mingyuan if he was lying under the soul oath. This meant that he wasn’t lying.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, it’s really a coincidence,” the woman said as though she was about to turn to look down the mountain. However, before she could turn around, she suddenly waved her hand and slashed at Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>This slash was too sudden. Furthermore, the woman’s Nihility Sword Aura was too fast. Before Wang Mingyuan could react, he was beheaded by the Nihility Sword Aura.</p>
<p>When Wang Mingyuan’s head fell from midair, his face was filled with shock and disbelief. It was as though he never expected the woman to kill him. He refused to believe it even in death.</p>
<p>“The path to immortality doesn’t tolerate one speck of dust.” The woman seemed to have done something trivial. She didn’t even look at Wang Mingyuan’s corpse.</p>
<p>It was impossible for anyone to survive under the Nihility Sword Aura unless Wang Mingyuan had the ability to undergo Nirvana Rebirth like a phoenix. Unfortunately, Wang Mingyuan wasn’t a phoenix, nor did he have the ability to revive.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan’s corpse and head fell from the mountain. Zhou Wen was originally sizing up the woman when he suddenly saw something rolling down. On careful look, his expression changed drastically.</p>
<p>“Teacher!” Zhou Wen reached out to grab Wang Mingyuan’s body and head. After confirming his death, his expression turned even uglier. This was indeed Wang Mingyuan’s corpse. He was dead.</p>
<p>In an instant, Zhou Wen seemed to make a decision. Unexpectedly, he threw Wang Mingyuan’s corpse away and ran down the mountain.</p>
<p>“The so-called feelings of humans are truly hypocritical.” The woman was first taken aback as a sneer appeared on her lips. She walked down the mountain.</p>
<p>She didn’t walk quickly as though she was taking a stroll, but despite Zhou Wen running at full speed, the distance between them became shorter and shorter.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen reached the mountainside, he heard a cold voice behind him. It sounded like it was coming from behind his neck.</p>
<p>“If you continue running, I’ll chop off your head just like your teacher.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body instantly froze as he stopped running. He slowly turned around and saw the woman standing less than three meters behind him, staring coldly at him.</p>
<p>“Sister, I don’t think we know each other, right?” Zhou Wen revealed a stiff smile as he looked at the woman.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1727'>Chapter 1727 Zhou Wen Draws the Sword</h3>
<p>“Are the elites among humans as cunning as you?” the woman said coldly as she stared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“That’s not right. You make it sound as though you aren’t human,” Zhou Wen said in thought when he saw that the woman didn’t immediately take action.</p>
<p>“How can I be a lowly creature like humans?” the woman said indifferently. “I’m giving you two choices now. Do you want to live or die?”</p>
<p>The woman spoke as though Zhou Wen’s life was firmly within her grasp. As long as she gently moved her fingers, she could crush Zhou Wen to death.</p>
<p>“Sigh, who wants to die if they can live?” Zhou Wen sighed.</p>
<p>“Come with me if you want to live.” As the woman spoke, she turned and walked towards the mountaintop.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hesitated for a moment before following the woman to the top of the mountain. As he walked, he asked, “Why do you want me to follow you up the mountain?”</p>
<p>“Doing what you wanted to do,” the woman answered.</p>
<p>“I really don’t know what I was planning on doing. Why don’t you make it clear?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“If you want to die, feel free to continue acting dumb.” The woman didn’t seem willing to waste her breath on Zhou Wen as she sped up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to get some information out of her, but when he heard her say that, he quickly followed her to the mountaintop.</p>
<p>The stone monument and sword hilt on the mountaintop remained the same. Zhou Wen naturally saw it at a glance and couldn’t help but recite, “The appearance of the sword spells doom for the world, even mighty immortals shall meet peril.”</p>
<p>“Pull that sword out,” the woman said expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“Why do you want me to pull out the sword? What sword is that?” Zhou Wen asked the woman, but he thought to himself, Could this be the Immortal Peril Sword of the Four Immortal Vanquishing Swords?</p>
<p>The sword didn’t have any aura, so Zhou Wen couldn’t tell if it was the Immortal Peril Sword.</p>
<p>“If you have so much time to talk, why don’t you pray that you can pull the sword out? Otherwise, you will follow in your teacher’s footsteps,” the woman said coldly.</p>
<p>“You killed my teacher just because he couldn’t pull out this sword?” Zhou Wen said in surprise.</p>
<p>“Don’t test my patience.” If not for the fact that she was unwilling to take the trouble to head out and find another human, the woman probably wouldn’t have allowed Zhou Wen to say so much.</p>
<p>“Will you keep your word? Will you really let me leave if I pull out the sword? Will you kick me to the curb when I’ve outlived my usefulness?” Zhou Wen looked around and didn’t find the phoenix that Liu Yun mentioned. He thought that it might have been killed by a woman.</p>
<p>I can only survive in front of the phoenix, but this woman can kill the phoenix. I wonder if the Chaos Egg can block her attack. Logically speaking, Earth hasn’t completely lost its seal, so dimensional creatures will still be greatly restricted on Earth. Even if she’s at the Apocalypse grade, she shouldn’t be able to unleash the power of the Apocalypse grade on Earth.</p>
<p>“I’m a woman of her word,” the woman said.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll believe you for now,” Zhou Wen said as he walked towards the stone monument. When he arrived in front of it, he didn’t grab the hilt. Instead, he bowed at the stone monument and seemed to chant something, but it was indecipherable.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” the woman asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that you wanted me to pray? I’m praying for the heavens to bless me so that I can pull the sword out of the stone monument,” Zhou Wen said in all seriousness.</p>
<p>The woman didn’t say anything else as she looked coldly at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen chanted for a while before looking up and reaching out to grab the hilt of the stone monument.</p>
<p>The hilt didn’t have any similarities to the hilt of the Immortal Culling Sword. It made Zhou Wen suspect if it was the Immortal Peril Sword. Logically speaking, the four swords that formed a set should have some similarities.</p>
<p>Who cares if it’s real or not. I’ll pull it out first. Whoever draws it naturally owns it, Zhou Wen thought to himself as he gripped the hilt with both hands and pulled.</p>
<p>The woman stared at the hilt and saw that it remained motionless. She immediately lost interest in Zhou Wen and raised her hand to use the Nihility Sword Aura to kill him.</p>
<p>The Immortals had the intention of making Zhou Wen their representative, but Zhou Wen had never gone to the Immortals with the token. Rejecting the Immortals made him their enemy. The fewer enemies like Zhou Wen on Earth, the better.</p>
<p>“Wait, I didn’t circulate my energy. When I finish circulating my energy, I’ll definitely pull it out,” Zhou Wen hurriedly said.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that he was afraid of fighting the woman. After all, they had to fight sooner or later. It was useless to be afraid. However, if he could pull out the sword first, it would naturally be better than being empty-handed.</p>
<p>Upon hearing his words, the woman didn’t immediately kill him. She only said coldly, “I don’t have that much time to waste on you. I’ll give you thirty breaths.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know how long thirty breaths were. Since the woman was willing to let him try, he decided to continue.</p>
<p>He first circulated the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra and attempted to pull out the sword again, but the sword remained motionless.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to switch to the First Order of Chaos before attempting to pull out the sword. However, the sword seemed to have taken root. No matter how hard Zhou Wen tried, he couldn’t budge the sword at all.</p>
<p>The woman stood by the side expressionlessly, but when she saw Zhou Wen use two completely different Essence Energy Arts that had already reached the Calamity grade, she thought to herself, Although this person is cunning, his talent is top-notch among humans. Without borrowing the powers of the dimension or fusing with a mutated bloodline, he can actually cultivate two Essence Energy Arts at the same time. Furthermore, he has reached the Calamity grade. It’s indeed rare. It’s no wonder that Immortal Supremacy of the race named him as a representative.</p>
<p>As she was thinking, she saw Zhou Wen use another completely different Essence Energy Art. Furthermore, he had also reached the Calamity grade. Her eyes couldn’t help but focus. He actually cultivated three Essence Energy Arts at the same time and they have all reached the Calamity grade. If such a talent can’t be used by us Immortals, I definitely can’t have him leave this place alive today.</p>
<p>The woman didn’t have any killing intent yet. Instead, she wanted Zhou Wen to become the representative of the Immortals.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art again, hoping to see if he could steal the sword, but there was still no reaction. This left Zhou Wen somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>He originally wanted to draw the sword before fighting the woman. Even if he couldn’t defeat her, he could escape with the sword. After all, he couldn’t let the sword fall into the hands of the Immortals.</p>
<p>However, the Essence Energy Arts he had tried were useless. It was probably very difficult to pull it out.</p>
<p>I’ll give it another try. Zhou Wen planned on giving it a try with the Dao Sutra in the end. If it didn’t work, he would have to give up.</p>
<p>Although he still had the Human Sovereign Sutra to use, it was too obvious. If he used it in front of the woman, she would probably recognize him as Human Sovereign. When that happened, she might even kill him.</p>
<p>Even if he wanted to fight, Zhou Wen hoped to keep the initiative with him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1728'>Chapter 1728 Immortal Sword Is Out</h3>
<p>Four Essence Energy Arts! The woman couldn’t help but be alarmed.</p>
<p>To be able to cultivate four Essence Energy Arts to such a stage was rare even in the dimension. It was unimaginable for a human to cultivate to such a stage.</p>
<p>A pure-blooded human can actually cultivate all four Essence Energy Arts to the Calamity grade. If he can really take that step in the future, he will definitely be an extremely terrifying existence. He will be a lord of a region even in the dimension… However, the woman thought again. I’m overthinking things. How can that step be so easy to take? Ignoring the four Essence Energy Arts, it’s probably difficult to cultivate one Essence Energy Art to the extreme, much less four.</p>
<p>Although the woman felt that it was unlikely for Zhou Wen to take that step to reach the Apocalypse grade, the way she looked at him was somewhat different.</p>
<p>Even if such a person can’t take that step, he can be considered invincible on Earth. If he can be used by us Immortals, who can compete with us for Earth’s Companion Beast? The woman thought to herself. However, this person can’t be left alive no matter what. Even if he can be used by me, I have to eliminate him in the future. It’s better to be safe than sorry. If he really takes that step, I’m afraid it will be difficult to control him.</p>
<p>As the woman was thinking, she suddenly felt her feet shake. The entire mountain shook.</p>
<p>It’s out! The woman was pleasantly surprised as she saw Zhou Wen slowly pull out the sword from the stone monument.</p>
<p>A portion of the blade had already been pulled out, revealing a layer of rust on the sword’s exterior. There was no light at all, but there was a terrifying killing intent.</p>
<p>Instead of calling it killing intent, it was more precisely a bloody aura. Just the smell made one’s hair stand on end. It was as though their blood was stirring restlessly and was flowing towards the sword.</p>
<p>It’s indeed that sword! Only now did the woman confirm that it was the immortal sword.</p>
<p>The sword looked rusty, but the woman knew that it wasn’t rust, but blood-blood of an immortal, the blood of a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal.</p>
<p>Back then, the immortal had killed countless Heaven Immortals with this sword. Even the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal stained the sword with his blood and was mercilessly slain by it.</p>
<p>This sword was probably the only one in the world with such a heavy bloodlust. It had a baneful aura that was fed from the blood of countless Immortals. There was only one in the world.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen circulated the Dao Sutra to draw the sword, the sword seemed to respond to him. It wasn’t as motionless as before. As his palms slowly moved away from the stone monument, the aura on the sword made Zhou Wen truly feel that it was indeed a sword that was part of a set with the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t know if it was the Immortal Peril Sword, this sword had an indescribable similarity to it.</p>
<p>The sword’s shape was completely different, and the aura on the sword was completely different. However, there was something deep down that was the same. How could Zhou Wen, who had been using the Immortal Culling Sword, not sense it?</p>
<p>As the sword was pulled out, the entire mountain shook more and more violently. Cracks also appeared on the stone monument. When the sword completely separated from the stone monument, the latter shattered.</p>
<p>The grass patch that was originally only a small part of the mountaintop grew crazily. In just a moment, the entire mountain peak was covered in grass. The grass continued growing at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>“Give me the sword.” Upon seeing Zhou Wen pull out the immortal sword, the woman forgot her aloof way of speaking. With a flash, she appeared in front of Zhou Wen and reached out to grab the immortal sword in his hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the immortal sword and felt the power surge like an ocean or a volcano that was about to erupt. It seemed to contain infinite power. It was a power that was filled with baneful aura, making killing intent rise in him.</p>
<p>Looking at the woman who was attempting to grab the immortal sword, Zhou Wen held the hilt with both hands and slashed down at her.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen brandished the dim sword, it seemed to transform into a sanguine beam that instantly slashed at the woman.</p>
<p>“You’re tempting fate!” the woman shouted coldly as an Essence Energy sword beam erupted from her hand.</p>
<p>The omnipresent sword beams instantly enveloped Zhou Wen and the immortal sword.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored the sword beams that approached him as he continued slashing at the woman with the immortal sword. At the same time, his body was enveloped by Great Brahma armor.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The immortal sword slashed apart the Nihility Sword Aura that could suppress the Yin Yang Rainbow Divine Light, leaving a diagonal bloody mark on the woman’s face, from her left forehead to the right of her chin.</p>
<p>What a powerful sword! Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised. The power of the sword was stronger than he imagined.</p>
<p>It was clearly a set of swords, but this immortal sword was much stronger than Immortal Culling. It made Zhou Wen suspect that his Immortal Culling Sword was really one of the four Immortal Vanquishing Swords, or was it just a replica.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen was reading too much into it. The Immortal Culling Sword was naturally not a replica. The Immortal Culling Sword wasn’t stronger than the Immortal Peril Sword either. The reason he felt that the Immortal Peril Sword was stronger was that its former owner had killed countless Immortals. Even a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal had been slain by the sword. The sword had absorbed the blood of countless Immortals, forming a baneful aura that made it even more effective against Immortals than the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>As expected of the sword that slew all Immortals. It’s stained with the blood of countless Immortals. This sword naturally has an extremely powerful restraining effect on Immortals. Even a mortal with this sword can slice through an Immortal’s body. Even I’m no exception. The woman stood far away and stared at the immortal sword in Zhou Wen’s hand, but she didn’t attack again.</p>
<p>I don’t know how long it’s been since I’ve been injured. The woman reached out to stroke the sword gash on her face. She didn’t seem angry. Instead, she seemed to be recalling something.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, this sword doesn’t seem compatible with you. It’s best I take it with me to prevent it from bringing you a bloody calamity.” Zhou Wen stared intently at the woman.</p>
<p>He wasn’t smug that his strike had injured the woman. In that situation, the woman was completely caught off guard. She only reacted at the last minute after the sword beam was destroyed. Yet, she could still dodge the strike that even Zhou Wen believed was fatal. Such speed wasn’t something Zhou Wen could match.</p>
<p>“Do you think you can really injure me with a sword?” The woman looked at Zhou Wen and said indifferently, “You still have a chance now. Hand the sword to me and swear to become the representative of my Immortals. I can let bygones be bygones.”</p>
<p>“We will only know if I can injure you after trying.” How could Zhou Wen give up the immortal sword he had obtained?</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that Zhou Wen didn’t have such plans to begin with, even if he had such plans in the past, he would probably be tempted when he saw the immortal sword’s might.</p>
<p>“I hope you won’t regret it.” The woman slowly raised her hand. The Nihility Sword Aura on her body condensed again, but the sword beam became fainter and fainter. In the end, one couldn’t sense the existence of the sword beams at all.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated as he instinctively summoned the Chaos Egg to protect himself.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1729'>Chapter 1729 Chaos Egg Cracks</h3>
<p>Just as the Chaos Egg enveloped Zhou Wen’s body, it suddenly caved in without any warning. It was as though something was squeezing the Chaos Egg from all directions, causing it to constantly distort like a balloon that could burst at any moment.</p>
<p>Looking at the Essence Energy Crystals that appeared crazily in the Chaos Egg, Zhou Wen secretly cheered inwardly. He couldn’t sense the existence of the sword beams at all. If not for his intuition and the existence of the Chaos Egg, he would have been severely injured by the terrifying sword beams.</p>
<p>The woman was somewhat surprised that her Nihility Sword Aura failed to penetrate the Chaos Egg</p>
<p>“Let’s see how long you can last.” The Nihility Sword Aura over the woman’s body surged out, hoping to blast the Chaos Egg apart.</p>
<p>However, no matter how mighty her sword beams were, they failed to break through the 1 Egg’s defense.</p>
<p>As expected, her strength is suppressed to a certain extent since Earth hasn’t completely lost its seal. It’s still within the Calamity grade range. Zhou Wen immediately felt relieved when he saw the Chaos Egg block the Nihility sword beams.</p>
<p>“Have fun. I won’t be joining you,” Zhou Wen said as he prepared to leave.</p>
<p>“To be able to withstand the Nihility Sword Aura, your strength should be Chaos. To be able to cultivate a Chaos-elemental Essence Energy Art to such an extent, and a pure defensive Essence Energy Art at that, I’m afraid only someone like you who can cultivate multiple Essence Energy Arts at the same time can do it,” the woman said as her tone turned even more unyielding. She continued, “Unfortunately, you are ultimately at the Calamity grade; the level you come into contact with is too low.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, the invisible Nihility Sword Aura suddenly changed. It stopped attacking the Chaos Egg and began rapidly spinning around</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Although the Chaos Egg’s defense was astonishing, it didn’t have any destructive power. With the sword beams spinning around it, it was unable to rush out.</p>
<p>Not only was he unable to rush out, but he was also forced to spin by the power of the sword aura.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg’s spinning didn’t affect Zhou Wen inside, but being trapped here and unable to leave clearly wasn’t good news for him.</p>
<p>“The Calamity grade is still low. Does that mean you are at the Apocalypse grade? However, it looks like the Apocalypse grade is nothing much. So what if you can retain me?” Zhou Wen probed.</p>
<p>The woman said disdainfully, “Chaos is the source of the world. It’s seamless, without beginning. It’s an indestructible whole, and nothing in the world can break it. If you were facing ordinary people, indeed no one could break it. Unfortunately, you encountered me. So what if it’s the One Essence of Chaos? Ignoring your mere Chaos Body, even when the world was in chaos, it could still be torn apart by supreme power. I shall slash apart Chaos today and carry out the splitting of the heavens and earth.”</p>
<p>Just as he said that, the Nihility Sword Aura that was spinning the Chaos Egg split into two. One sword aura made the Chaos Egg spin clockwise while the other sword aura made the Chaos Egg spin counter-clockwise. The sword aura’s differing directions made parts of the Chaos Egg spin in two different directions.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression changed slightly as he immediately understood what the woman was up to. The One Essence of Chaos was an inseparable whole, resulting in an indestructible Chaos Egg. Even if one’s strength was stronger than Zhou Wen’s, it was difficult to crack it.</p>
<p>However, there was no true One Essence of Chaos in this world. It was like a microscopic particle. Every time people believed that a particular particle was the smallest particle that couldn’t be split, they would realize that it wasn’t the smallest, nor was it truly inseparable with the development of technology</p>
<p>What the woman did was forcefully add Yin and Yang to the Chaos Egg. When the Chaos Egg had Yin and Yang, it was no longer an indestructible whole.</p>
<p>Originally, this was almost impossible, but the woman’s Nihility Sword Aura was also similar to Chaos, making the impossible possible.</p>
<p>Of course, the main reason was that the woman’s level was too high. Her level was far above Zhou Wen’s, and her understanding of Chaos was far beyond his.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen’s understanding of Chaos could reach the same level as the woman’s, would the Chaos Egg be changed by the Nihility Sword Aura? It depended on who was stronger.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had realized the problem, it was already too late.</p>
<p>As the Nihility Sword Aura constantly spun in two directions, cracks appeared on the distorted Chaos Egg. The cracks appeared to be strangely symmetrical. They looked extremely beautiful, but to Zhou Wen, it was a fatal blow.</p>
<p>This was the first time the Chaos Egg had been torn apart in a head-on clash. In the past, even if the Chaos Egg exploded, it would explode from the inside. It had never been torn apart from the outside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be amazed that knowledge was power. Although their strengths were at the Calamity grade and Zhou Wen’s body wasn’t at the Calamity grade, the difference wasn’t overwhelming. The difference in knowledge was fatal.</p>
<p>Despite seeing the cracks on the Chaos Egg increase, Zhou Wen remained extremely calm.</p>
<p>Battles were ever-changing. Anything could happen.</p>
<p>Although experts who could steer a battle were terrifying, they weren’t considered top-notch existences if they didn’t have the ability to deal with all sorts of unexpected situations.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was far inferior to the woman in terms of knowledge, the art of combat didn’t veer off from a core principle. The most basic things couldn’t be violated.</p>
<p>Since my knowledge is inferior to yours, I’ll turn your knowledge into mine. Zhou Wen had the Teacher Domain activated the entire time as he analyzed the woman’s Nihility Sword Aura.</p>
<p>If it were any other ability of the Immortals, the Hell-level Teacher Domain might not be able to analyze it. However, the Nihility Sword Aura was the same as the Chaos Egg. They were both Chaos-type powers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the woman had said some key information, allowing Zhou Wen to understand the crux of the matter. The speed at which the Teacher Domain analyzed the Nihility Sword Aura far exceeded its usual speed.</p>
<p>Even analyzing some ordinary Calamity-grade creature abilities wouldn’t be as fast as now.</p>
<p>If the woman knew that her words would leave such a huge impact on Zhou Wen, she probably wouldn’t have said so much nonsense.</p>
<p>The power of the Nihility Sword Aura was born from the void. Like Chaos, it was power from before the world was created. Although it was called a sword aura, it could actually take any form.</p>
<p>It could be a wall, a shield, or even a palace. It could change into whatever shape she wanted.</p>
<p>Nihility doesn’t mean that there’s really nothing. Nothingness itself is an existence… As the rules analyzed by the Teacher Domain increased, Zhou Wen’s understanding of the Nihility Sword Aura deepened.</p>
<p>It’s still a little short. Chaos Egg, hold on! The Teacher Domain hadn’t completely analyzed the Nihility Sword Aura. The nomological connections weren’t complete, so it couldn’t transform into an Essence Energy Art.</p>
<p>However, the Chaos Egg couldn’t hold on any longer. It shattered under the Nihility Sword Aura as Zhou Wen’s body was instantly exposed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1730'>Chapter 1730 Level Gap</h3>
<p>The moment the Chaos Egg shattered, the killing intent in the woman’s eyes intensified. Since Zhou Wen couldn’t be used by her, she definitely couldn’t allow such a human to exist in the world.</p>
<p>The Nihility Sword Aura pressed down on Zhou Wen from all directions, hoping to crush his body to dust.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s eyes were clear. The dark golden wheel behind Great Brahma’s armor shimmered with a dark glow as though all the light in the world was being sucked in by it.</p>
<p>“Break!” Great Brahma’s destructive power bloomed with Zhou Wen’s fist as he struck the woman.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The power of Great Brahma slammed into the Nihility Sword Aura and shattered it. Zhou Wen took the opportunity to charge at the woman.</p>
<p>A look of surprise flashed in the woman’s eyes. Although the Nihility Sword Aura wasn’t as indestructible as the Chaos Egg, there weren’t many forces that could blast through</p>
<p>In a situation of equal strength, there were definitely no more than ten powers in the dimension that could withstand the Nihility Sword Aura. For Zhou Wen’s strength to blast through the Nihility Sword Aura meant that the Essence Energy Art he cultivated was in the top ten, or at least similar.</p>
<p>However, this wasn’t enough to surprise the woman. What truly surprised her was that Zhou Wen had chosen to clash with her head-on.</p>
<p>From the point of view of the average person, the front was where the power was the strongest. If Zhou Wen only wanted to crack the Nihility Sword Aura, he should attack from other weak spots.</p>
<p>However, the Nihility Sword Aura wasn’t the case. In fact, the woman had placed the weakest point of the Nihility Sword Aura right in front.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen chose the front. It was unknown if he had really seen through it or if he was lucky to attack the weakest spot.</p>
<p>Is it just a coincidence? The woman’s killing intent intensified.</p>
<p>The two Essence Energy Arts that Zhou Wen had displayed were extremely rare in the dimension. One was the pure defense of Chaos, while the other had destructive power. It was somewhat similar to the supreme power of the Buddha race, but there were obvious differences. It appeared like an anomalous Essence Energy Art.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen had cultivated four Essence Energy Arts. Even if the other two Essence Energy Arts weren’t comparable to these two, it was already terrifying enough.</p>
<p>The woman’s hand moved slightly as the invisible sword beams once again closed in on Zhou Wen from all directions.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen actually broke through the Nihility Sword Aura again. This time, Zhou Wen chose the leftmost area to break through the Void Sword Aura. It happened to be the weakest spot.</p>
<p>It’s not a coincidence! A strange glint flashed in the woman’s eyes as she once again condensed the Nihility Sword Aura to suppress Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The outcome was the same. Zhou Wen could choose the weakest spot to break every time, making it difficult for her to kill him.</p>
<p>“You can actually see the Nihility Sword Aura?” the woman said as she stared at Zhou Wen. The sword aura on her body continued crushing down at him.</p>
<p>“If you can see through my Chaos powers, why can’t I see through your Nihility Sword Aura?” Zhou Wen broke through the sword beams again and again as he asked.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen wasn’t having it well. Great Brahma’s destructive power was ultimately inferior to the Nihility Sword Aura. Every time he tore through the sword aura, Zhou Wen would suffer a backlash.</p>
<p>If his body was at the Heaven level, such a recoil wouldn’t be able to injure him. However, he was only at the Terror grade. Such a recoil affected his body significantly.</p>
<p>If not for the Great Brahma armor having already absorbed and reflected most of the force, his body would have long collapsed. Now, Zhou Wen felt as though his organs were about to rupture as blood seeped out of his seven orifices.</p>
<p>Thankfully, with the armor enveloping his body, the woman couldn’t see Zhou Wen’s situation.</p>
<p>“Is that so? Then let me see if you really understand.” The Nihility Sword Aura on the woman’s body suddenly converged and transformed into an invisible sword in her hand.</p>
<p>The woman realized that the scattered Nihility Sword Aura wasn’t enough to kill Zhou Wen, but the Nihility Sword Aura she condensed was enough to easily break through Great Brahma’s destructive power.</p>
<p>The woman slashed out at an unbelievable speed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen quickly moved as he condensed Great Brahma’s power to blast at the Nihility sword beam.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The power of Great Brahma that could absorb and destroy everything like a black hole was sliced apart by the Nihility sword beam in the woman’s hand as though it was tofu.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen also used that instant to dodge the Nihility Sword Aura’s slash.</p>
<p>The woman slashed three times in a row, and Zhou Wen dodged all three times. Although he was in a sorry state and barely dodged each time, it was enough to surprise the woman.</p>
<p>“As expected, you understand,” the woman said coldly. “But so what if you understand? I’ll let you know what the gap in level is.”</p>
<p>Only then did the woman move her feet and stab at Zhou Wen like a fairy.</p>
<p>This strike was fast enough. Zhou Wen saw an opportunity and suddenly drew the immortal sword to slash at the woman’s body.</p>
<p>The immortal sword slashed at the invisible sword beam like a blood beam, but it brushed past it. The woman’s figure was like a veil in water as she gracefully swept past Zhou Wen. The invisible sword beam streaked across the Great Brahma armor and sliced through the nearly indestructible dark-gold armor.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to use instant transmission on the mountaintop. Only then did he barely dodge the strike before the sword sliced through his body.</p>
<p>On Great Brahma’s armor, there was a crack that nearly covered his entire chest. Blood was seeping out of the wound.</p>
<p>“You can actually use spatial teleportation on this mountain?” The woman looked at Zhou Wen in surprise.</p>
<p>“Why can’t I?” Zhou Wen didn’t feel any discomfort. It was probably due to the effects of the Teacher Domain that he wasn’t injured by the restrictions on the mountain.</p>
<p>“Alright,” the woman said out of the blue as she slashed at Zhou Wen again.</p>
<p>Her form was light and ethereal. Every strike was like a dance. Each strike didn’t seem to have much strength exerted, but Zhou Wen knew that any strike was enough to cause pandemonium.</p>
<p>It was also in a place like Kunlun Mountain that greatly suppressed the energy fluctuations. Just the fluctuations of the sword aura could probably collapse a mountain.</p>
<p>One strike after another, Zhou Wen used the immortal sword in one hand and the power of Great Brahma in the other to resist the woman’s Nihility Sword Aura.</p>
<p>However, from beginning to end, be it the immortal sword or the power of Great Brahma, they failed to touch the woman’s Nihility Sword Aura.</p>
<p>The woman seemed to be able to predict the future. Even if Zhou Wen used instant transmission, she could appear where he had instant transmitted. When Zhou Wen instant transmitted, the sword beam was almost on his neck.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly flipped the immortal sword in his hand and used the hilt to block the Nihility Sword Aura. Only then did he escape the beheading calamity. He didn’t dare continue instant transmitting. A bloody mark on his neck was testament that Great Brahma armor couldn’t block the terrifying Nihility Sword Aura.</p>
<p>In just a moment, Zhou Wen’s Great Brahma armor was covered in bloody marks as blood seeped out in a ghastly sight.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1731'>Chapter 1731 Too Late</h3>
<p>He couldn’t block it. He couldn’t block the woman’s attack at all.</p>
<p>What Zhou Wen believed to be a perfect setup and move appeared full of flaws in front of the woman. It forced Zhou Wen to pay a certain price to block her attacks.</p>
<p>The immortal sword in his hand that could resist the Nihility Sword Aura failed to touch the Nihility Sword Aura in the woman’s hand.</p>
<p>This pressure made Zhou Wen recall the word “dimensional-lowering strike.” Many of the woman’s means exceeded Zhou Wen’s understanding</p>
<p>The woman’s words were very arrogant, but she did have the right to be arrogant. The difference in knowledge was indeed huge.</p>
<p>I can’t take it anymore. If this continues, I won’t be able to last until the Teacher Domain finishes analyzing the Nihility Sword Aura. Zhou Wen’s injuries increased as his heart turned colder.</p>
<p>The woman was like an omnipotent god. No matter how Zhou Wen’s strength and technique changed, she seemed to be able to see through everything and crack Zhou Wen’s painstaking setup.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to be struck by the Nihility Sword Aura again, his figure suddenly vanished and appeared on the other side of the mountaintop.</p>
<p>The woman was slightly taken aback. This time, she hadn’t expected Zhou Wen’s location of appearance, nor did she manage to attack immediately.</p>
<p>“Five Elements As One Escape technique?” The woman frowned slightly as she looked at the grass fruit baby on Zhou Wen’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen secretly cheered inwardly. If he hadn’t dodged the strike, one of his arms would have been severed.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was secretly glad that he had brought the grass fruit baby with him. It was the grass fruit baby who had used an escape technique to help him escape the strike.</p>
<p>When the woman attacked again, Zhou Wen could only continue fighting to the death. The grass fruit baby occasionally used an escape technique to help him, but it was only once in a while. It didn’t use an escape technique to help Zhou Wen escape every time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen understood why the grass fruit baby hadn’t been using an escape technique to help him. It wasn’t that the grass fruit baby was unwilling, nor was it that it lacked strength.</p>
<p>The real reason was the woman. This was because after the grass fruit baby used several escape techniques to help Zhou Wen escape, the woman’s prediction of where Zhou Wen would appear became closer and closer to where he appeared. It was only a matter of time before she could accurately predict his location. Furthermore, it wouldn’t take long.</p>
<p>“There aren’t many people in the dimension who know an escape technique that combines the five elements. However, in front of me, it’s just a tiny trick,” the woman said as she slashed out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, who had just escaped in a sorry state, found a bone-deep gash appear on his chest.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that the woman had completely seen through the grass fruit baby’s escape technique. If the grass fruit baby used the escape technique to help him, he would probably be killed the moment he phased into existence.</p>
<p>I can’t dodge anymore. Zhou Wen stopped his fast-moving footsteps and stared intently at the woman’s feet with a heavy mood.</p>
<p>Although there were many changes to the sword technique, no matter how he stabbed and slashed, the final path to attack Zhou Wen was the same. What was truly unpredictable was the woman’s movement technique.</p>
<p>As long as he could predict the woman’s trajectory, it would be much easier to use the immortal sword to block the Nihility Sword Aura.</p>
<p>After suffering so many strikes and watching for so long, Zhou Wen already had a general idea of the woman’s movement technique, but he wasn’t sure if he could block it.</p>
<p>“Are you giving up so quickly?” the woman said coldly without stopping. Her graceful figure instantly appeared in front of Zhou Wen as she slashed at him with the Nihility Sword Aura.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t retreat as though he had seen an opportunity. The immortal sword in his right hand slashed in a direction.</p>
<p>“It’s over. How can you predict an immortal technique?” Amidst the woman’s teasing, the immortal sword missed as the Nihility Sword Aura slashed at Zhou Wen’s neck from the other side.</p>
<p>The woman believed that she would definitely be able to kill Zhou Wen this time. At such a close distance, even an escape technique wouldn’t be able to help Zhou Wen escape. And the hand without the immortal sword couldn’t withstand the full-powered slash of the Nihility Sword Aura with Great Brahma’s strength alone.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>A noise that sounded like glass shattering sounded beside Zhou Wen. The Immortal Culling Sword appeared in Zhou Wen’s left hand as the blade blocked his neck, forcefully slicing through the Nihility Sword Aura.</p>
<p>“This sword… So you are Human Sovereign…” The woman immediately recognized the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t dare call myself Human Sovereign. I’m just one of many lives.” Zhou Wen held the immortal sword in one hand and the Immortal Culling Sword in the other as he stared intently at the woman’s footsteps.</p>
<p>“Alright, it’s time for me to eliminate this calamity for my Immortals.” The woman moved again like a fairy, making it impossible to tell her intended direction. The Nihility Sword Aura had already arrived in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The Nihility Sword Aura was formless to begin with. Coupled with such unpredictable movement techniques, if it were an ordinary Calamity-grade creature, they probably wouldn’t even be able to see where the sword aura was, much less withstand it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen only had one belief in mind. No matter what, he had no other choice but to believe in his analysis and judgment.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The Immortal Culling Sword missed, but the immortal sword struck the Nihility Sword Aura again, resolving the calamity of death.</p>
<p>The woman frowned slightly. This was the second time Zhou Wen had blocked her attack.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t completely predict her behavior, so he prepared two sets of actions every time. The sword in one hand was both a prediction and a type of sealing.</p>
<p>If his prediction was correct, he would naturally be able to block the Nihility Sword Aura. If his judgment was wrong, he could also seal the area, shrinking the area that the woman could attack. It made things more predictable.</p>
<p>This method wasn’t smart, but without powerful calculating and multitasking abilities, it was impossible.</p>
<p>The woman didn’t seem to believe that Zhou Wen could really block her attacks as she attacked again and again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used both swords in unison and blocked the woman’s attacks again and again. Although there were times when his judgment was wrong and he was injured by the woman, the injuries weren’t fatal.</p>
<p>In fact, this was also a deliberate act on Zhou Wen’s part. When he couldn’t make a confident judgment, he chose to seal off the routes of certain fatal trajectories, preventing the Nihility Sword Aura from killing him.</p>
<p>“As expected of the strongest human. You are indeed capable, but multitasking is too ordinary among the Immortals.” As the woman spoke, she condensed the Nihility Sword Aura in her other hand, planning on using the two swords to fend off Zhou Wen’s two swords.</p>
<p>“It’s too late.” Zhou Wen looked at the woman as a smile surfaced over his lips.</p>
<p>If the woman had used two swords from the beginning, it wouldn’t have been difficult to crack his dual swords, but things were different now. After so many rounds of clashing, Zhou Wen was completely familiar with the woman’s behavior.</p>
<p>Just as the woman had said, there was no true One Essence of Chaos in the world. Similarly, there was no true fixed form. Anyone, even an Immortal, had their own behavioral rules.</p>
<p>However, the woman’s movement technique was varied, so much so that it looked irregular. However, just because it didn’t look regular didn’t mean it wasn’t regular.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1732'>Chapter 1732 Everything Under Apocalypse Is a Mirage</h3>
<p>“What do you mean too late?” The woman didn’t immediately take action as she asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Your sword beams won’t be able to injure me again.” Zhou Wen’s high-strung nerves relaxed along with his body. The two swords in his hands drooped casually to the ground.</p>
<p>“It’s good to be confident, but blind confidence will kill you,” the woman said indifferently. She didn’t take Zhou Wen’s words to heart and even treated them as a joke.</p>
<p>Previously, Zhou Wen had only been able to block her attacks because he had used the two immortal swords to restrain the advantage of the Immortals. He had to exchange injuries for survival.</p>
<p>Now that Zhou Wen had said that her sword couldn’t injure him again, the woman naturally didn’t believe him.</p>
<p>“Haven’t you always wanted my life? What about now?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Alright.” The woman struck out after saying a single word. She brandished her swords together. Even if Zhou Wen could block one of the sword-like Nihility Sword Aura, the other would definitely be able to kill him.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>However, two consecutive sounds of sword beams being snapped entered her ears. The two immortal swords in Zhou Wen’s hands accurately slashed at the incorporeal sword aura, snapping them.</p>
<p>“Impossible!” The woman didn’t believe it. She condensed her sword aura and attacked Zhou Wen again.</p>
<p>She refused to believe that a Calamity-grade creature like Zhou Wen could see through her sword technique.</p>
<p>Although her strength was only at the Calamity grade, her knowledge and realm were at the Apocalypse grade. It was impossible for a Calamity-grade creature to see through her sword technique.</p>
<p>However, the subsequent battle forced the woman to accept reality. Her sword technique had really been seen through, or rather, her movement technique had been seen through.</p>
<p>No matter how the woman’s movement technique and sword technique changed, the two swords in Zhou Wen’s hands could accurately find the two beams of Nihility Sword Aura. Instantly, the two of them exchanged more than ten thousand blows, but the Nihility Sword Aura in the woman’s hand failed to injure Zhou Wen again.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with this human!” The way the woman looked at Zhou Wen changed. She found it unbelievable that a human could have such terrifying combat strength and talent.</p>
<p>“I’ve said it before. Your sword aura can no longer injure me.” Zhou Wen’s mind calmed down.</p>
<p>A level suppression was just a result of a knowledge difference. It was akin to how ancient people only knew how to use blades, but had never seen modern firearms. When using blades against firearms, they would naturally suffer greatly.</p>
<p>However, when ancient people learned how to use a gun, it might not be worse than those using it in the present day. They might even be better.</p>
<p>The difference in knowledge was sometimes the easiest to bridge. As the woman struck Zhou Wen with a dimensional-lowering strike, she also made him quickly absorb some knowledge that he originally couldn’t come into contact with.</p>
<p>The average person would be different, but Zhou Wen was someone with excellent learning abilities and the courage to experiment.</p>
<p>On the mountaintop, sword strikes sounded incessantly.</p>
<p>Not only could Zhou Wen block the woman’s attacks, but he could even occasionally counterattack.</p>
<p>“You are indeed very strong. You live up to your name as Human Sovereign. Unfortunately, you were born in the wrong place.” The woman sighed as though she was feeling sorry for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“If you were born in a large race in the dimension, you would definitely be an overlord with such talent. You would have great achievements. Unfortunately, you were born among humans and are only at the Calamity grade. It will probably take a long time to advance to the Apocalypse grade, but you don’t have the time,” the woman said with a look of pity.</p>
<p>“So what? I’m still young. I have plenty of time. I can afford to wait,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“No, you can’t wait any longer. This is because you have to die here today. Although I’m already beginning to admire you, you can’t be used by me. I ultimately can’t let you live in this world. Otherwise, you will definitely be a calamity for our Immortals in the future.” The woman spoke sincerely as she recognized Zhou Wen’s talent and abilities. Even she was very afraid of him.</p>
<p>“Should I thank you for your praise or should I hate you for killing me?” Zhou Wen curled his lips.</p>
<p>“Neither. Death is like the extinguishing of a lamp. Apart from life, everything else is ephemeral. It’s like how the Buddha race talks about reincarnation. They are just fooling themselves. You don’t need to thank me, nor do you need to hate me. Cherish every second you live, even if it’s just an additional moment.”</p>
<p>The woman paused for a moment before saying, “A person like you shouldn’t die like this, but you had to be human. Tell me, do you have any last wishes? Perhaps I can help you fulfill them.”</p>
<p>“You make it sound as though I’m doomed.” Zhou Wen wasn’t angry. As he spoke, he fought the woman, hoping to understand more about her movement techniques, sword techniques, and the Nihility Sword Aura.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve already decided to kill you, so you will definitely die.” The woman suddenly retreated and stood there looking at Zhou Wen. She said with a serious expression, “Tell me your last wish.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have any last wishes, nor do I need them. If there’s a need, you can tell me your last wishes,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Pity.” The woman sighed and stopped looking at Zhou Wen. She even looked up at the Kunlun dome.</p>
<p>The sky above Kunlun Mountain looked no different from the sky outside. The scorching sun was high in the sky.</p>
<p>However, this sky wasn’t the real sky. Kunlun Mountain itself was a pocket world. Even if one had the ability to fly or burrow underground, they couldn’t rush out from Kunlun Mountain’s sky.</p>
<p>The sword intent on the woman’s body rose like a blade that pierced into the sky.</p>
<p>The entire Kunlun Mountain’s sky changed color. The originally sunny weather immediately became filled with dark clouds. Furthermore, there was a faint light brewing in the dark clouds, as though infinite lightning was gathering.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression changed drastically. From what the woman was doing she was probably going to forcefully break through the restrictions in Kunlun Mountain and use the power of the Apocalypse grade.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had never seen how terrifying an Apocalypse-grade power was, but he knew that it was definitely overwhelming.</p>
<p>The Immortal Culling Sword and immortal sword slashed at the woman crazily. The woman stood there without any intention of dodging, allowing the two swords that could restrain Immortals to slash at her body.</p>
<p>However, the immortal sword that could even slice through the Nihility Sword Aura seemed to slash at an invisible steel wall. It stopped three feet away from the woman. No matter how Zhou Wen exerted strength or dealt a barrage of attacks, he couldn’t advance any further.</p>
<p>The two swords slashed down like an onslaught, but the woman didn’t even spare them a glance.</p>
<p>“Everything under Apocalypse is a mirage. It’s just an empty dream.” The woman retracted her gaze from the sky and slowly looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1733'>Chapter 1733 Calamity of the Apocalypse</h3>
<p>Is the power at the Apocalypse grade really that invincible? Zhou Wen was alarmed. The Immortal Culling Sword and immortal sword had the effect of restraining Immortals. With his full-powered attack, he couldn’t even approach the woman.</p>
<p>Escape!</p>
<p>This was the only thought Zhou Wen had. He wanted to rush down the mountain, but his body seemed to sink into the void as he found it difficult to use any strength.</p>
<p>The feeling was very strange. It was as though everything around him had turned into an empty vacuum. There was no place to act his strength on, so there was naturally no way to move.</p>
<p>No, it should be said that it was a state even more terrifying than a vacuum. Even he seemed to have turned into an unreal existence.</p>
<p>“Everything under the Apocalypse will return to nothingness. To be able to die under the power of the Nihility Calamity makes you the number one human in the world. You shouldn’t have any regrets.” The woman looked at Zhou Wen like a god. Although the two of them were standing at almost the same height, it felt like the woman was looking down at him.</p>
<p>Nihility Calamity? Zhou Wen stared at the woman without a word as he looked at the lightning in the sky from the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>He knew that the woman definitely wouldn’t be able to maintain such power for long. Using an Apocalypse-grade power on Earth’s Kunlun Mountain would definitely put immense pressure on her. If time passed, even if Zhou Wen didn’t take action, the woman would be destroyed by the restriction’s power.</p>
<p>The problem was if he could last until then. The power of the Apocalypse already made him find it redoubtable. He switched several Essence Energy Arts, but he was unable to escape the restraints of the Nihility power.</p>
<p>The face of the grass fruit baby lying on Zhou Wen flushed red as though it was trying its best to use an escape technique. However, it was the same as Zhou Wen. No matter how hard it tried, it couldn’t escape, much less escape with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The restrictions on Earth are more powerful than I imagined. It looks like I don’t have much time left. It’s time to end this. The woman looked at the lightning in the sky and couldn’t help but frown slightly.</p>
<p>“It’s time to send you on your way.” The woman looked at Zhou Wen and was about to kill him when she suddenly heard a phoenix’s cry from the side of the mountain.</p>
<p>The phoenix that had been sent retreating by the woman flew up the mountain like a rainbow. It instantly arrived at the mountaintop and charged at Zhou Wen, who was standing there motionless.</p>
<p>The woman watched as the phoenix charged at Zhou Wen without stopping it. It was as though she had the intention of finishing the phoenix off as well.</p>
<p>The phoenix on the mountain isn’t dead? What does it want? Does it want to take the opportunity to kick me while I’m down? Several thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could figure it out, the phoenix had already rushed in front of him. However, the phoenix’s target wasn’t Zhou Wen, but the immortal sword in his hand.</p>
<p>“You still want to snatch the immortal sword at a time like this? Even if you snatch the immortal sword, will that woman let you off?” Zhou Wen imagined that the phoenix was trying to snatch the sword.</p>
<p>However, what happened next surprised Zhou Wen. The phoenix slammed into the immortal sword as its entire body seemed to melt while it rushed into it.</p>
<p>The blood-stained immortal sword immediately emitted a rainbow glow due to the fusion of the phoenix. When the phoenix completely fused with the immortal sword, the immortal sword emitted Rainbow Divine Light like a sun emitting rainbow beams.</p>
<p>I see. It’s no wonder I didn’t see the sword’s glint from this sword before. So the immortal sword’s glint had actually transformed into a phoenix. The woman wasn’t alarmed when she saw this scene. Instead, she was delighted</p>
<p>It was useless even if the immortal sword had a glint. The owner of the immortal sword was no longer the Immortal who had killed all the immortals. A Calamity-grade creature holding the immortal sword with a glint couldn’t produce much power.</p>
<p>This ended up benefiting the woman. A complete immortal sword was naturally more valuable than an immortal sword without its glint.</p>
<p>Just as the woman was feeling delighted, she heard a strange cry. In the distant sea of clouds, a strange white bird rushed towards the mountain peak.</p>
<p>The woman was slightly surprised when she saw the strange bird. She didn’t recognize what it was.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was taken aback when he saw the white bird. It was clearly the phoenix he had encountered in the Kunlun Mountain garden, but it was still in the form of a white chicken.</p>
<p>As the white bird charged towards the mountain peak, the white feathers on its body gradually turned rainbow-colored. Its body was rapidly transforming into a phoenix.</p>
<p>It’s actually a phoenix? The woman was somewhat surprised as she carefully sized up the white bird that was transforming into a phoenix. She seemed to notice something and muttered to herself, “This is a little strange. This phoenix seems to be somewhat similar to the phoenix formed by the immortal sword’s glint, but it’s also somewhat different. It’s not a pure manifestation of the sword glint…”</p>
<p>As the woman pondered, the white bird had already transformed into its rainbow phoenix form. It charged at Zhou Wen like the previous phoenix.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me it wants to rush into the immortal sword as well? Zhou Wen was secretly delighted.</p>
<p>The more strength he had, the more hope he had. Although he didn’t know if he could resist the power of the Apocalypse, it was better to have more help.</p>
<p>To his surprise, the phoenix didn’t charge at the immortal sword. Instead, it charged at Zhou Wen and slammed into his chest.</p>
<p>The rainbow beam imprinted on Zhou Wen’s chest like a colorful phoenix tattoo.</p>
<p>At the same time, Zhou Wen felt a force surge into his body and instantly fill it. Even the dark-gold Great Brahma armor turned colorful.</p>
<p>“So that’s how it is.” The woman seemed to come to a realization as a sneer suffused the corners of her mouth. “Phoenix Immortal, oh Phoenix Immortal, so you have long perished. Even your sword intent has turned mortal. Fine by me. Today, I’ll vanquish your will and snatch your sword. When the Immortals return to this world, it would be eternal merit.”</p>
<p>After the phoenix fused with Zhou Wen’s body, not only did Zhou Wen feel that his body was filled with sword intent as though it was about to explode, but he also felt that he had formed an indescribable connection with the immortal sword.</p>
<p>Previously, although he could borrow the power of the immortal sword with it in hand, it was ultimately a relationship between a human and a tool. Now, he felt as though he was connected to the immortal sword by blood.</p>
<p>With the augmentation of the two phoenixes and Zhou Wen’s own strength, it seemed to weaken the Apocalypse power. His body regained some mobility.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, he thrust the immortal sword that emitted a rainbow-colored glassy glow at the woman in front of him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen seemed to fuse with the immortal sword as he transformed into a rainbow beam that charged at the woman.</p>
<p>The sword beam tore through the Nihilistic power of the Apocalypse and went for the woman’s chest.</p>
<p>The unparalleled sword beam tore through the layers of Nihility and arrived in front of the woman. Just as it was about to pierce her chest, it suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>The woman raised her right hand in front of her chest and clamped the blade of the immortal sword with her index and middle fingers, preventing it from advancing an inch.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1734'>Chapter 1734 Slaying Immortal Supremacy</h3>
<p>“So what if it’s a Phoenix Immortal’s sword intent? You aren’t Phoenix Immortal after all. You are ultimately mortal without the phoenix’s tribulation. Even if I can’t completely use the power of the Nihility Calamity, killing you will be as easy as flipping my hand.” The woman clasped the sword in one hand and raised her other hand to strike Zhou Wen’s head.</p>
<p>The suppression from the world intensified. If this continued, her body would probably not be able to withstand it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed. Such a powerful force was still easily resolved by the woman. The difference between the Calamity grade and the Apocalypse grade was greater than Zhou Wen imagined. It was already impossible to escape. Zhou Wen seemed to have no chance against the woman’s palm that carried the power of the Apocalypse.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the woman’s body paused as her palm that was striking at him came to a stop.</p>
<p>Teacher! Zhou Wen immediately understood something. He crazily activated the power in his body as he continued stabbing the immortal sword at the woman.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had always guessed that Wang Mingyuan hadn’t really died. After he killed the white dragon under Dragon Gate Grotto, the white dragon had once existed in a state that humans couldn’t see. Furthermore, it possessed extremely terrifying death powers.</p>
<p>Back then, Zhou Wen had wondered if Wang Mingyuan had obtained the same power. However, he had only suspected it previously. Now that he saw the anomaly in the woman’s body, he immediately confirmed his previous guess.</p>
<p>The woman’s body was affected. At the instant her fingers that clasped the immortal sword relaxed, the immortal sword passed through her fingers and stabbed straight at her chest.</p>
<p>Her clothes tore as the sword plunged into her flesh. The rainbow sword beam tore through her crazily in a bid to fully penetrate her body. However, the sword beam was instantly restrained by the power of the Nihility Calamity. The immortal sword’s tip that had just stabbed in couldn’t continue forward as blood flowed down the sword.</p>
<p>No matter how hard Zhou Wen exerted his strength, the immortal sword seemed to have taken root and didn’t budge.</p>
<p>“Wang Mingyuan, you sure are capable at scheming. You actually managed to hide from my eyes. Unfortunately, you still underestimate the power of the Apocalypse grade. No matter how you scheme, you are ultimately a clown in front of absolute strength,” the woman said as she slowly raised her left hand and swatted at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>It was obvious that Wang Mingyuan still had a certain influence on the woman’s body, but this influence was rapidly weakening.</p>
<p>If not for Wang Mingyuan’s strange and bizarre form and the fact that he was attached to the woman’s body, the woman would have long killed him with a slap.</p>
<p>However, this was only a matter of time. After resolving Zhou Wen and the immortal sword, even if Wang Mingyuan possessed the woman’s body, it would ultimately be difficult for him to escape death.</p>
<p>eN</p>
<p>Just as the woman’s palm was about to strike Zhou Wen’s head and the power of the Nihility Calamity was about to finish him, a look of delight flashed in Zhou Wen’s eyes.</p>
<p>Teacher Domain had finally completed its analysis. It transformed into strange words that formed an Essence Energy Art-Nihility Sword Art. Almost at the same time, the Teacher Domain advanced from the Hell level to the Heaven level.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen unleashed the power of the Teacher Domain with all his might. At the same time, he threw away the Immortal Culling Sword in his other hand. He held the immortal sword with both hands and pushed it forward with all his might.</p>
<p>The nomological powers analyzed by the Teacher Domain could be completely screened, but that was only against powers below the Calamity grade. Zhou Wen didn’t know how useful the Teacher Domain was against powers at the Apocalypse grade.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t have the luxury of time to consider it. In this situation, either one of them died, so he could only take a gamble.</p>
<p>Although the power of the immortal sword had weakened the power of the Nihility Calamity, the latter still gave Zhou Wen immense pressure, greatly reducing the strength he could muster.</p>
<p>The moment the power of the Teacher Domain appeared, Zhou Wen immediately felt his body sink. The feeling of having nowhere to direct his force vanished without a trace. He was immediately delighted.</p>
<p>The woman was already confident of victory. Just as she was about to kill Zhou Wen, she suddenly felt an intense pain in her chest. The immortal sword penetrated her chest as the rainbow sword beam penetrated her body, causing rainbow patterns to appear over her body. It was like the cracks in a torn painting that had been reattached.</p>
<p>The woman’s palm struck Zhou Wen’s head almost at the same time, sending him flying. Great Brahma’s helmet caved in as he tumbled far away, nearly falling off the mountain.</p>
<p>“No… Impossible…” The woman looked down at the immortal sword that had penetrated her chest with a look of disbelief.</p>
<p>“I’ll take your life.” A faint voice sounded from the woman’s body. It was cold and emotionless—Wang Mingyuan’s voice.</p>
<p>“Wang Mingyuan, don’t be too happy. This is only an avatar of my true body. Even if you kill the clone, you won’t obtain any substantial benefits. Death will only await you when you return to the dimension.” The woman’s body disintegrated by the power of the immortal sword. Without the support of her body, the power of the Nihility Calamity quickly dissipated as the terrifying lightning in the sky gradually receded. “I don’t need to obtain any substantial benefits. I just need your experience and knowledge. Perhaps to you Immortals, strength is supreme, but to humans, knowledge is the greatest power. This is enough for me.” Wang Mingyuan’s voice sounded again. “Furthermore, this is Earth, Kunlun Mountain. Even if you are Immortal Supremacy’s avatar, you can’t make contact with her, right?”</p>
<p>“So retrieving the immortal sword was your scheme from the beginning. You wanted to kill me from the beginning.” The woman’s voice was filled with anger. She wished she could slap Wang Mingyuan into meat paste.</p>
<p>However, when she used her strength, the fine patterns on her body widened. Blood instantly dyed her clothes red. It looked like she had just been scooped out of a pool of blood.</p>
<p>“Why torture yourself? Phoenix Immortal’s sword slew all immortals. Having your heart pierced through and staining this sword gives you zero chance,” Wang Mingyuan said with a sigh.</p>
<p>The woman was so angry that she wanted to say something, but when she opened her mouth, blood spewed out. Rainbow light seeped out of her mouth as her entire body cracked from a bursting rainbow light.</p>
<p>“If not for… Earth’s… suppression of strength… How could you… injure me… And that person… That person…” The woman looked at Zhou Wen and said in a daze. Before she could finish her sentence, her body had completely collapsed, turning into minced meat and broken bones.</p>
<p>A ghost-like figure walked out of the woman’s shattered body and went towards Wang Mingyuan’s corpse that Zhou Wen had thrown to the side. It transformed into crystals that resembled ice and jade and quickly condensed into Wang Mingyuan’s body.</p>
<p>“Little Wen, your growth is so fast that it far exceeds my expectations.” Wang Mingyuan smiled at Zhou Wen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1735'>Chapter 1735 I’ll Wait for You at the Immortals</h3>
<p>“Teacher, are you still you?” Zhou Wen looked into Wang Mingyuan’s eyes and asked slowly.</p>
<p>“What am I?” Wang Mingyuan picked up the sword on the ground and handed it to Zhou Wen. He continued, “In different environments, there will be a different me. Born in a remote mountain village, I’m a villager. In school, I’m a student. In the military, I’m a soldier. After becoming a commander, I’m a leader. These can all be me, but me in every period of time has different thoughts and views. It can also be said that every stage of me is no longer the same me as before.”</p>
<p>“What are you now?” Zhou Wen asked as he took the sword.</p>
<p>Up to now, Zhou Wen still remembered the question Wang Mingyuan had asked him and his students. Zhou Wen already knew Wang Mingyuan’s choice, but just as Wang Mingyuan had said, people had different thoughts in different environments. Was the present Wang Mingyuan still the same Wang Mingyuan?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t be sure. He felt that he knew less and less about Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>“I’m me. At least nothing can change me now,” Wang Mingyuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Then I’m relieved.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>“I’ll wait for you at the Immortals.” Wang Mingyuan looked at Zhou Wen with a glazed look. It was unknown what he was thinking.</p>
<p>“I’ve already decided not to become the representative of the Immortals,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>However, Wang Mingyuan only smiled and said, “That’s not important. I’ll wait for you.”</p>
<p>With that said, Wang Mingyuan didn’t wait for Zhou Wen to say anything else before heading down the mountain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Wang Mingyuan’s back and seemed to have many things to say, but he didn’t seem to have anything to say. He opened his mouth but didn’t say a word in the end. All he did was watch Wang Mingyuan disappear down the mountain.</p>
<p>I hope Earth’s seal will last longer. Zhou Wen had already acutely sensed the power of the Apocalypse grade.</p>
<p>Just the power unleashed by an Apocalypse-grade powerhouse’s avatar nearly killed him. Furthermore, this was under the suppression of Earth’s power. The avatar failed to unleash the full might of the Apocalypse.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t believe what a disaster would be if Earth completely lost its seal and a true Apocalypse-grade powerhouse descended.</p>
<p>Before Earth completely lost its seal, he had to obtain the power to fight an Apocalypse-grade existence no matter what. Otherwise, it would be a calamity.</p>
<p>I have to quickly advance to the Calamity grade. Zhou Wen sheathed the Immortal Culling Sword. Just as he was thinking about where to place the immortal sword, it flew towards its scabbard.</p>
<p>The Immortal Culling Sword’s scabbard could only accommodate the Immortal Culling Sword and didn’t have any excess space. However, when the immortal sword flew over, it strangely inserted itself into the scabbard and stuck tightly to it.</p>
<p>When the immortal sword was sheathed, the hilt seemed to undergo some strange changes. Two ancient words, “Immortal Peril,” appeared on the hilt.</p>
<p>It’s indeed the Immortal Peril Sword. Zhou Wen had long guessed it, but he was still somewhat delighted when he saw the name.</p>
<p>The Immortal Peril Sword and Immortal Culling Sword had a powerful restraining effect on the Immortals. And now, the strongest race in the dimension was the Immortals. In the future, if he could find the Immortal Vanquishing Sword and the Immortal Entrapment Sword, he might be able to fight them even if he couldn’t reach the Apocalypse grade.</p>
<p>I wonder where the other two immortal swords are. Zhou Wen also knew that it was too difficult to gather all four immortal swords.</p>
<p>Unwilling to stay on Kunlun Mountain any longer, Zhou Wen packed his things and left the mountain. He saw Liu Yun at the exit. Liu Yun didn’t seem to know anything as he asked Zhou Wen if he had obtained the immortal sword.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you see Teacher?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement. If Liu Yun had seen Wang Mingyuan, he probably wouldn’t have asked such a question.</p>
<p>“No.” Liu Yun shook his head.</p>
<p>“I’ve got it. Let’s head back now.” Zhou Wen didn’t know if the Immortals would send anyone over now that an Apocalypse-grade avatar had been destroyed here. It was best to leave as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“It’s good that you got it. I still have something to do, so I won’t be returning with you.” Liu Yun heaved a sigh of relief and waved goodbye to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to keep him around as he returned to Guide Ancient City alone.</p>
<p>After returning to the ancient city, Zhou Wen got Li Xuan to help him gather information about the dimensional zones, hoping to find a dimensional zone that matched the Godfiend</p>
<p>Era.</p>
<p>He himself was studying the Kunlun Mountain dimensional zone on the mysterious phone. He entered the strange stone chamber through the familiar door, but he didn’t see the metal container or the white bird.</p>
<p>However, there were many grass fruit babies in the garden.</p>
<p>Speaking of grass fruit babies, the grass fruit baby that followed Zhou Wen had actually followed him back to Guide Ancient City. It followed Zhou Wen all day without any intention of leaving.</p>
<p>He attempted to enter the garden to pluck the grass fruit babies. They grew on grass vines and couldn’t escape at will. Zhou Wen easily plucked them.</p>
<p>However, before he could think of a way to deal with the grass fruit baby in his hand, he suddenly felt the entire garden shake. Roots that resembled dragons drilled out of the ground and swept towards the blood-colored avatar with a demonic glow.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen condensed Great Brahma’s power and blasted at the dragon-like root, forcefully snapping it. However, the root blotted out the sky and enveloped him from all directions, preventing him from even instant transmitting.</p>
<p>Great Brahma’s power bombarded the layers of roots crazily, but the roots seemed endless. In the end, he was trapped inside and could only use the Chaos Egg to defend.</p>
<p>The roots enveloped the Chaos Egg, but they were unable to burst it. Just as Zhou Wen was about to carefully observe the roots, he realized that the Chaos Egg was shrinking.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen realized that after the roots enveloped the Chaos Egg, many tiny roots attached to it as though they were rooted in the ground as they absorbed the Chaos Egg’s power.</p>
<p>Not only did the Chaos Egg not produce any Essence Energy Crystals, but it also had quite a bit of energy sucked away. The Chaos Egg’s strength was weakening.</p>
<p>What’s this? It can actually restrain the Chaos Egg! Why didn’t I see it when I entered the garden in reality? Zhou Wen ignored the Chaos Egg and scanned the source of the root.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t see the source of the roots from as far as he could sense. The roots came from underground; he didn’t know if they came from the same plant.</p>
<p>Before long, the Chaos Egg was sucked dry. The blood-colored avatar’s body was also exposed as it was bound by the roots. The roots were like blood-sucking leeches that sucked dry the Great Brahma armor and the blood-colored avatar’s body. The game screen then went black.</p>
<p>This thing is at the Apocalypse grade, right? Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1736'>Chapter 1736 Final Countdown</h3>
<p>Dripping a drop of blood to revive, he entered the garden again. After a few attempts, Zhou Wen realized that as long as he didn’t touch the strange flowers and grass in the garden, the strange root wouldn’t appear. As long as he damaged the flowers, the roots would immediately appear.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that the number of roots was unimaginable. No matter how many roots Zhou Wen severed, he would ultimately be trapped by them. Furthermore, that thing could absorb any form of energy. As long as he was trapped, it was equivalent to death. No defensive skill could withstand it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen temporarily gave up on the idea of benefiting from the garden and went to the canyon at Kunlun Mountain.</p>
<p>There were many spores in the canyon. These things were most suitable for Tai Sui and Primordial Spore’s growth. However, he didn’t know if Primordial Spore’s level was too low; he was afraid that it would end up being parasitized instead of being the parasite.</p>
<p>After releasing Tai Sui and Primordial Spore, Tai Sui immediately pounced towards the spot with the most spores like a glutton seeing a feast.</p>
<p>However, Primordial Spore wasn’t in a rush. It circled around the blood-colored avatar for a while before flying towards a fist-sized red fungus and burrowing in.</p>
<p>Su Yi and Professor Gu were doing a program, but this time, the program’s screen wasn’t a battle scene, but a countdown on the Cube.</p>
<p>The Big Dipper dimensional zone had already entered a countdown. There was less than an hour left.</p>
<p>“Professor Gu, there are less than fifty minutes left. Up to now, no one has challenged the North Pole Star Palace. Human Sovereign’s first ranking might very well last until the end,” Su Yi said excitedly.</p>
<p>“Don’t… Beauty Su, don’t ask the Sect Master such a question. If he jinxes it again, Human Sovereign will be in danger…” The comments were filled with wailing.</p>
<p>“Sect Master, please don’t jinx Human Sovereign.”</p>
<p>“Beauty Su, are you trying to kill my Human Sovereign! What kind of grudge do you have with him?”</p>
<p>Professor Gu’s face nearly darkened as he looked at the screen that was filled with pleading. He cleared his throat and said, “Currently, the strongest representatives are Mohe and Karoman. However, their strength shouldn’t be enough to clear the hidden North Pole Palace dimensional zone. Unless a new expert appears, Human Sovereign’s first place should still be secured.”</p>
<p>When Professor Gu said that, his heart raced. Human Sovereign, you have to hold the fort. Whether you can wipe away my title of Jinx is up to you.</p>
<p>Professor Gu had failed so many times in the past, but Human Sovereign had never been jinxed by him no matter how hard he tried. Now, he finally understood. He grabbed Human Sovereign and tried jinxing him as best as he could, hoping to rely on Human Sovereign to redeem himself.</p>
<p>Of course, his jinxing was actually just his normal analysis.</p>
<p>The more Professor Gu said such things, the more flustered the audience became. Many people who hoped that Human Sovereign could obtain first place were panicking.</p>
<p>Time ticked by. In the last ten minutes, no one entered the Cube to challenge it.</p>
<p>Ol16</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, Human Sovereign’s first place is secured,” Professor Gu said as he secretly heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>However, just as he said that, the Cube’s screen suddenly changed. Someone had challenged the Big Dipper Palace by entering</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>“It’s over, it’s over. Sect Master has shown his might. Our Human Sovereign is in danger.”</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, the Sect Master doesn’t give up unless he kills our Human Sovereign!”</p>
<p>“Who’s challenging it now? I’m so flustered.”</p>
<p>Professor Gu’s heart skipped a beat. He hurriedly took a closer look and realized that the person who had entered the Big Dipper Palace was surprisingly Mohe, who was ranked third.</p>
<p>“Although Mohe is very strong, it should still be a little difficult to challenge the hidden North Pole Star Palace. After all, he didn’t even clear the Army Breaker Star Palace before this,” Professor Gu hurriedly said when he saw that it was Mohe.</p>
<p>“Sect Master, please stop talking!” The comments were begging for mercy; they almost occupied the entire screen.</p>
<p>“Why is Mohe challenging again at this moment? Is he confident of clearing the hidden North Pole Star Palace?” Su Yi was also uneasy.</p>
<p>Although Mohe was considered a human powerhouse, Su Yi still hoped that Human Sovereign could obtain first place.</p>
<p>After Mohe entered the Star Palace, he didn’t hesitate to quickly storm through one Star Palace after another. It looked like he really had the intention to head to the hidden North Pole Star Palace.</p>
<p>Everyone’s hearts were in their throats. Soon, they saw Mohe rush into the Army Breaker Star Palace. Furthermore, the stairs that could drain Essence Energy in front of the Star Palace didn’t have any effect on him.</p>
<p>After Mohe defeated Starlord Army Breaker, as everyone had expected, he did what Human Sovereign did and activated the teleportation nexus to head to the North Pole Star Palace.</p>
<p>“Heavens, is Mohe really going to fight Starlady Polestar!”</p>
<p>“Professor Gu’s mouth is really blessed. Whatever he says goes the other way.”</p>
<p>“Human Sovereign’s first place is in danger. Mohe must have come prepared. It’s impossible for a powerhouse like him to tempt fate on impulse!”</p>
<p>“No way?” Professor Gu felt like crying. He was more nervous than anyone else.</p>
<p>He pretended to be calm, but he was shouting desperately in his heart, Please don’t… You have to hold on…</p>
<p>Just as people were guessing how Mohe would defeat Starlady Polestar, they were stunned when they saw the scene in the North Pole Star Palace.</p>
<p>The North Pole Star Palace remained the same, but Starlady Polestar wasn’t inside. It was actually an empty Star Palace.</p>
<p>“How did this happen?” Everyone, including Mohe and Professor Gu, was stunned.</p>
<p>Su Yi reacted quickly and immediately thought of a possibility. She said excitedly, “I get it. The hidden North Pole Star Palace is different from ordinary Star Palaces. The Starlady in this Star Palace will only appear once. Only the first person to defeat her will obtain benefits.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. That’s it.” Professor Gu also slapped his thigh in excitement. “There’s only one Starlady Polestar. In other words, the first person to defeat her will definitely be first. Human Sovereign has really secured his first place.”</p>
<p>Mohe searched the Star Palace but didn’t find any traces of Starlady Polestar. He then understood what had happened and was extremely depressed.</p>
<p>It hadn’t been easy for him to think of a way to defeat Starlady Polestar. He had even spent a lot of money to borrow many powerful Companion Beasts, but he never expected such an outcome.</p>
<p>Although he was indignant, he had no choice but to leave the Star Palace.</p>
<p>The Cube’s countdown had already gone to zero by the time Mohe exited. The Cube’s screen revealed a starry sky.</p>
<p>In the Star Palace, one could see the Big Dipper emit light one after another. Furthermore, the light was extraordinary, so bright that it made one’s heart tremble.</p>
<p>Boom! The first star of the Big Dipper exploded. The dazzling light penetrated the Cube’s screen, blinding everyone.</p>
<p>Following that, the Big Dipper stars exploded one after another. Finally, the North Star emitted its final brilliance, drowning its screen in a light blast produced by the huge explosion.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1737'>Chapter 1737 Mystic Thearch</h3>
<p>When the Cube’s screen dimmed again, the screen had already turned into the Cube’s ranking</p>
<p>Under the gaze of everyone, the last name on the Cube’s ranking turned into fragments of light and dissipated. Then, from bottom to top, the names shattered and vanished.</p>
<p>Moments later, there was only one name left on the rankings—Human Sovereignshimmering eternally like the sun.</p>
<p>“We ultimately failed.” In front of the dimension’s Cube, a non-human creature that looked human stared at the shimmering words “Human Sovereign” and sighed.</p>
<p>As for most humans on Earth, they fell into a euphoric revelry. Although they didn’t know who Human Sovereign was or if he was even human, most humans seemed to gain something in their hearts. It was indescribable, but it made their hearts feel weightier and less restless.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been gaming on his phone and hadn’t left his room in days. At that moment, he was pulled to the Cube by Li Xuan as he looked at the glorious words “Human Sovereign.”</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, why do I find these words so pleasing to the eye?” Li Xuan felt as though something was stirring in his body. He wished he could do something, but there was no place for him to vent.</p>
<p>“These words are a little ugly,” Zhou Wen said after looking at the words for a long time.</p>
<p>“Ugly? Why don’t I think so?” Li Xuan tilted his head and sized it up for a moment before shaking his head.</p>
<p>“It’s a little ugly,” Zhou Wen said as he walked to the Cube and reached out to touch it.</p>
<p>The Cube immediately lit up as Zhou Wen’s body was sucked into it. However, this time, he didn’t teleport to any dimensional zone. Instead, he appeared in an empty darkness.</p>
<p>In the darkness, there were seven blobs of light shimmering. On careful look, they represented seven different Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>Are these the Big Dipper Companion Eggs? Zhou Wen looked at the seven Companion Eggs. Although he knew that they were already his, he couldn’t feel happy.</p>
<p>The Big Dipper stars shattered, producing these Companion Beasts. If Earth’s Companion Beast were to appear in the future, Earth would share the same outcome as the Big Dipper stars.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was pondering over it, the seven Companion Eggs lit up at the same time. They trembled as though they were about to fly towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, when they really moved, they didn’t fly towards Zhou Wen. They seemed to be attracted by an invisible vortex as they spun around the center of the void.</p>
<p>As the spinning speed increased, the light on them transformed into meteors that flew towards the center of the vortex. The light also weakened.</p>
<p>Despite devouring so much light, the middle of the vortex became darker and darker as though the darkness had transformed into something corporeal that condensed into a black Companion Egg.</p>
<p>When the light on the seven Companion Eggs completely vanished, they also vanished, leaving only the extremely black Companion Egg floating in the void.</p>
<p>The Companion Beasts of the Big Dipper were actually absorbed by the Companion Beast of the North Star. What kind of Companion Beast is it? A sword? Or is it armor? Or could it be… Before Zhou Wen could finish his thoughts, the Companion Beast of absolute darkness rushed towards him and instantly shot into his forehead.</p>
<p>A black tattoo gradually appeared on Zhou Wen’s forehead. The tattoo’s style was strange as though it wasn’t static. It constantly changed every second, making it difficult to see its true appearance.</p>
<p>With a thought, the constantly changing black tattoo tore out of his body and transformed into a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>This is… Starlady Polestar… Zhou Wen looked at the Companion Beast in surprise.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast was wearing Absolute Darkness armor. As it was too dark, light couldn’t even reflect. At a glance, it looked like a black silhouette. However, its figure resembled Starlady Polestar, but it gave Zhou Wen a different feeling.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had already received the information on the Companion Beast, he habitually took out his phone to take a look.</p>
<p>Mystic Thearch: Calamity (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Emperor</p>
<p>Life Soul: Mystic</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Birth (S-grade)</p>
<p>Terror Form: Nirvana</p>
<p>Calamity Zone: Sovereign of the Universe (Heaven level)</p>
<p>Strength: 999</p>
<p>Speed: 999</p>
<p>Constitution: 999</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 999</p>
<p>Talent Skill: None</p>
<p>Companion Form: Soul</p>
<p>Holy sh*t! What the hell is this! Zhou Wen looked at the Mystic Thearch’s stats and didn’t close his mouth for a long time.</p>
<p>In terms of stats, it was really the best among the best. It was directly at the Heaven level and had 999 stats. Zhou Wen had only seen such stats on Truth Listener before. This was the second one.</p>
<p>However, this thing didn’t even have a single skill. It had to be known that the seven Starlords had special skills. Furthermore, every special skill had their unique characteristic. As long as one used it well, it would be a powerful killing machine.</p>
<p>There was no need to mention Starlady Polestar. Just the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array was infinitely profound.</p>
<p>This thing gathered the characteristics of eight celestial bodies’ Companion Beasts, but it didn’t have a single skill. Wouldn’t that make it a pure Strength-type Companion Beast?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen already had Truth Listener as a Strength-type Companion Beast. No one would mind having another top-notch Companion Beast, but it was repeated after all. Furthermore, no matter how strong a Strength-type Companion Beast was, it was probably not as strong as Truth Listener that was invulnerable to everything. This thing didn’t have that ability, so it was easily affected by all sorts of taboo powers. It might not be able to unleash its mighty powers in actual combat.</p>
<p>You should at least get me two skills. Even without the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, at least give me two of the other Starlords’ powers like reflective damage and forming prisons with books! Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed, but he knew that the Mystic Thearch definitely had his advantage.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen received the Mystic Thearch Companion Beast, the words “Human Sovereign” on the Cube’s screen finally dissipated. The Cube’s screen gradually turned black and returned to a dead silence.</p>
<p>Everyone believed that the matter was over. Some people had already planned on switching off their phones to do something else. Even the livestream program was prepared to switch to the host and guest’s commentary.</p>
<p>However, to their surprise, the Cube that had just turned black suddenly lit up again.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at the scene in shock, unsure what had happened. They imagined that something hadn’t ended, but when they saw the scene on the Cube, they realized that a new dimensional zone had appeared on the Cube, launching a new Cube battle.</p>
<p>“Why would a new dimensional zone appear so quickly?”</p>
<p>“The Cube actually activated a Cube battle back to back. Has this ever happened before?”</p>
<p>“What is this place? It doesn’t look like a planet, right?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’ve seen it before.”</p>
<p>The people on Earth looked at the scene on the Cube, but no one recognized what dimensional zone it was.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1738'>Chapter 1738 The Cube Starts Again</h3>
<p>On the Cube’s screen was a lake enveloped in fog. At a glance, it was only a foggy lake. Although there was no end in sight, it made one feel that it was a lake and not an ocean.</p>
<p>It was impossible to tell what place it was just from the scene. There were countless rivers and lakes on Earth. Just from this scene, it was impossible to guess where it was.</p>
<p>People were discussing what it was. The analysts of the various programs had all sorts of guesses, but no one could say with certainty what it was.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen came out of the Cube and immediately saw the scene on it. His pupils constricted.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, the Cube is here to provide you warmth again. From the looks of it, it’s time for you to reap some benefits again,” Li Xuan said with a smile as he looked at the scene on the Cube.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid it won’t be that simple this time.” Zhou Wen’s expression was solemn.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? Is there anyone on Earth who can snatch first place from you?” Li Xuan asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“No one on Earth can snatch it from me, but I’m afraid this isn’t just limited to humans on Earth.” Zhou Wen stared at the Cube’s screen without blinking.</p>
<p>“You mean…” Li Xuan seemed to guess something as his expression turned odd. He looked at the scene on the Cube and said,” Don’t tell me you want to say that the dimensional zone on the Cube is the dimension?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been to the dimension once. It does look like it. Call Ming Xiu over,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Li Xuan hurriedly gave Ming Xiu a call and got him over. Without waiting for Li Xuan to ask, Ming Xiu said, “I saw it on the livestream. The place where the Cube is might very well be in the dimension.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean ‘might very well be?”” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“Previously, when I went to the dimension, the place I went was limited to the Inter race’s territory. I’ve never been to places outside the Inter race. The place on the screen is completely different from the Inter race’s territory, but there’s one place that’s very similar,” Ming Xiu said.</p>
<p>“What’s similar?” Li Xuan looked around, but he couldn’t tell what was different between the lake on the screen and a lake on Earth. It was just a little misty.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu explained, “The dimension’s space is different from our space. It’s impossible for creatures below the Mythical stage to see the matter around them, much less move. It’s just like how three-dimensional creatures can’t understand the four-dimensional world…”</p>
<p>“Then it’s even more impossible for it to be the dimension. This scene has been broadcast for quite some time. Everyone on the Internet can see this lake. Even children without cultivation can see it,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“You can’t see it because your level in life isn’t high enough. In essence, it’s also a manifestation of order and rules. As I’ve been to the dimension, I can sense similar order and rules above the misty lake. The reason why ordinary people can see it is because the existence of the Cube has modified the transmission scene to a certain extent. If one really goes there, ordinary people can only see the distorted dazzling light. No, I’m afraid they won’t even be able to see the dazzling light and will be killed…” Ming Xiu explained.</p>
<p>“Is that so?” Li Xuan had never been to the dimension, so he didn’t know if what Ming Xiu said was true.</p>
<p>“If Ming Xiu thinks so too, then there’s likely no mistake about it.” Zhou Wen nodded as many thoughts flashed through his mind.</p>
<p>“Heavens, if that’s really the dimension, doesn’t that mean that we can storm into the dimension through the Cube?” Li Xuan’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>“In theory, yes. But have you thought about why the Cube can show the dimension?” Ming Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that simple? It means that the Cube is resourceful. It can even connect to the dimension,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu shook his head and smiled bitterly. “Can’t you think deeper?”.</p>
<p>“Speak your mind and spout your nonsense. Are you itching for a beating again? Stop leaving me hanging?” Li Xuan snorted coldly.</p>
<p>“What if the dimension is just a dimensional zone?” Ming Xiu asked.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was taken aback when he heard that. His expression turned nasty as he said after a while, “That’s impossible, right?”.</p>
<p>“The possibility isn’t high, but what if it is?” Ming Xiu said with a bitter smile, “Even if it isn’t, this dimensional zone is in the dimension. In other words, there’s no suppression of Earth’s cosmic rules there. If those dimensional creatures can enter, do you think we humans will still have a chance of getting first on the Cube’s rankings?”</p>
<p>Ming Xiu, who had been to the dimension, knew better than Li Xuan how terrifying the dimension was. Human Sovereign was already considered very strong on Earth, but in the dimension, lifeforms below the Apocalypse grade weren’t considered powerhouses.</p>
<p>“I was just thinking about how to use this thing to counterattack the dimension, but I forgot about that,” Li Xuan said gloomily. “I don’t think the Cube will do that. If those sick fellows from the dimension can also be on the rankings, there’s no point in humans participating.” “No, those creatures from the dimension will definitely be able to get on the rankings.” Zhou Wen sighed and said, “Didn’t the dimension control the Cube in the past? Although I can tell that they can’t really control the Cube, I’m certain that they can enter the Cube. They just can’t adapt to the rules of Earth’s universe.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to be afraid of. It’s something from the dimension to begin with. At most, we’ll give it to them. We’ll just storm over when we have the strength in the future,” Li Xuan said after some thought.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid this matter isn’t that simple. I have a nagging feeling that there’s something amiss, but I can’t figure it out immediately,” Zhou Wen said with a frown.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Zhou Wen. The factions with representatives also realized how unusual this dimensional zone was. They were alarmed and puzzled as they guessed what it meant.</p>
<p>As everyone discussed, the Cube’s screen suddenly changed. Someone had activated the Cube’s challenge.</p>
<p>“Someone challenged the Cube so quickly? I wonder who it is?”</p>
<p>“It’s Human Sovereign? Mohe or Karoman?”</p>
<p>“There are so many people who are willing to take the risk. We don’t even know what dimensional zone this is, but someone has actually attempted it.”</p>
<p>The average man on the street discussed spiritedly, but people who really knew what kind of dimensional zone it was were filled with worry.</p>
<p>When the challenger appeared on the screen, the expressions of many human powerhouses changed.</p>
<p>With gold armor and a dark-gold staff, a lifeform that looked almost no different from humans other than being more than twice as tall as humans-standing at four to five meters tall at the very least-appeared.</p>
<p>On the forehead of the lifeform was a third eye. When it opened, it was like a golden sun, very similar to the Sun Sage God engraved in the Sun God Holy Temple.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1739'>Chapter 1739 Lake of Fog</h3>
<p>“It’s indeed in the dimension,” Li Xuan said gloomily as he looked at the golden god-like creature.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, Ming Xiu, and company didn’t say a word as they watched the creature walk towards the lake.</p>
<p>His body emitted a golden sun-like glow. The fog over the lake quickly dispersed as the surroundings instantly became clear.</p>
<p>However, there was still nothing on the lake. All that could be seen was water ripples.</p>
<p>The creature from the Sun race walked on the surface of the lake. His tall body looked like he was walking on flat ground over the water surface. He had the aura of a true god descending to the mortal world.</p>
<p>After walking a short distance, the water suddenly churned. The lake water seemed to come to life as it transformed into a pair of arms that wrapped around the Sun race member. They grabbed his legs and were about to pull him into the lake.</p>
<p>The Sun race member’s body emitted a golden glow as the pair of water arms seemed to vaporize due to the high temperature, instantly turning into steam. A strange scream sounded underwater before there was silence.</p>
<p>Moments later, the lake seemed to boil. The waves churned as pairs of arms extended out of the lake. The entire lake seemed to turn into a forest of arms.</p>
<p>Countless water arms grabbed at the Sun race member as the distant water arms crawled out of the water. One could see that they were water demons condensed from water. They looked a little like humans, but their ears were like fins. Where their legs should have been, there was a snake’s tail.</p>
<p>The countless water demons leaped out of the water and pounced at the Sun race member, but he didn’t panic at all. The Sun God Light on his body glowed brightly as all the water demons that were illuminated immediately vaporized. No water demon could approach him.</p>
<p>The Sun race member walked deeper into the Lake of Fog step by step.</p>
<p>There were countless water demons in the lake, but none of them could approach him. Along the way, countless water demons were vaporized by the Sun God Light.</p>
<p>In just more than ten minutes, the fog ahead opened up and a swath of green appeared.</p>
<p>A small green island appeared over the lake. The island was flat and there were almost no undulations. The ground was covered in green grass, but in the middle of the island, there was a tree. The tree looked like a crown, and its trunk looked ordinary. However, the leaves looked like they were forged from silver. There were many golden apple-shaped fruits on the tree.</p>
<p>The Sun race member walked to the tree and reached out to pluck a golden apple. Then, he walked to a spot similar to a teleportation nexus. As the teleportation nexus’s light rose, the Sun race member vanished.</p>
<p>The Cube’s screen changed as a Cube ranking appeared. On it was the name “Sun race’s Raleigh.”</p>
<p>“That’s it? It looks simple. The fruits on the tree are limited. I don’t know if there will be any left after plucking them. Why don’t we take the opportunity to pluck one now?” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“It looks simple, but there’s something profound about it. Don’t act rashly.” Ming Xiu hurriedly stopped Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Just as Li Xuan was about to say something, he saw the Cube’s screen light up again. Another person was challenging the Cube.</p>
<p>“It’s the representative of the Family Clan of Gods, Reddy.” Li Xuan immediately recognized a human with flames burning all over his body.</p>
<p>Reddy clearly had the same thoughts as Li Xuan. He wanted to take the initiative and pluck the golden apple now.</p>
<p>The Sun race’s Raleigh had relied on his power of the sun to safely cross the Lake of Fog. His power of fire and the power of the sun were both scorching. He believed that it wouldn’t be difficult to deal with the water demons.</p>
<p>However, when Reddy landed on the lake, his body sank into it.</p>
<p>A look of horror appeared on Reddy’s face as though he was struggling to fly up, but it was to no avail. His flaming body quickly sank into the lake. All one could see was a red glow gradually dimming under the lake. Moments later, there was no sign of him. The Cube’s screen switched back to the rankings. On it was still ‘Sun race’s Raleigh.’</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s expression turned nasty as he said with lingering fear, “That was close. That Reddy was at the Calamity grade after all. He also had the power of fire that restrains the water element, but he was actually finished just like that. Thankfully, I didn’t go.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Li Xuan who felt a lingering fear. Upon seeing this scene, many people on Earth were alarmed. Reddy was considered a famous figure now. He had also entered the top ten in the previous battle of the Big Dipper. Nobody expected him to die so easily.</p>
<p>Instantly, the Lake of Fog and Raleigh became a hot topic of discussion. Due to Raleigh’s appearance, the average person knew that the place might be a dimension. People clearly became more intrigued about the dimension.</p>
<p>Of course, they were also guessing Raleigh’s level. The Calamity-grade Reddy had died without a stir, but Raleigh could easily pass through the Lake of Fog. The difference was extraordinary. Some people even guessed that he was at the Apocalypse grade.</p>
<p>However, a human powerhouse like Zhou Wen knew that it was impossible for Raleigh to be at the Apocalypse grade, but he was very likely a Heaven-level existence.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was also paying attention to the Lake of Fog, he had no intention of challenging it. The most important thing now was to quickly advance the remaining two Essence Energy Arts to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Tai Sui and Primordial Spore were doing well in Kunlun Mountain’s canyon. The spores had given them immense help. Tai Sui had already reached the Calamity grade and was still growing. It was only a matter of time before Primordial Spore advanced to the Calamity grade. In the future, they would be two very important combat forces.</p>
<p>However, he hadn’t found a suitable dimensional zone that matched the Godfiend Era. This left him depressed.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, look who’s here.” One day, Zhou Wen was studying the information on dimensional zones when he heard Li Xuan’s voice coming from afar.</p>
<p>“Wang Lu!” Zhou Wen went out and saw Li Xuan and Wang Lu walk over.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, why do you look the same? Even a woman like me is jealous,” Wang Lu said with a smile as she sized up Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“You haven’t changed much either,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Li Xuan whistled. “Old Zhou, what’s with that look in your eyes? Wang Lu has clearly grown a lot.”</p>
<p>Not only did Li Xuan accentuate the word ‘grown’, but he also dragged it out. As he spoke, he even scanned Wang Lu from top to bottom.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but look in the direction of his gaze. Wang Lu’s face immediately flushed red as she slapped Li Xuan in the face, jerking his face to the other side as his mouth contorted.</p>
<p>“That’s unfair. Old Zhou ogled as well. Why did you only hit me?” Li Xuan rubbed his face and said indignantly.</p>
<p>“Blame it on your mouth!” Wang Lu spat and turned to Zhou Wen. “I heard you are looking for a spatial dimensional zone?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1740'>Chapter 1740 Infinite Reset</h3>
<p>“How did you know?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise. He had gotten Li Xuan to secretly carry out a search for spatial dimensional zones. Although it wasn’t as exaggerated as absolute confidentiality, he didn’t tell anyone.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, it’s been so many years, but why haven’t you improved at all? Someone has clearly been paying attention… Ouch…” Before Li Xuan could finish his sentence, Wang Lu pinched him.</p>
<p>“Alright, you guys continue chatting. I’ll leave, alright?” Li Xuan winked at Zhou Wen before turning to leave.</p>
<p>After Li Xuan left, Wang Lu said to Zhou Wen, “I heard from Li Xuan that you are looking for a spatial dimensional zone. Coincidentally, I recently encountered a somewhat special spatial dimensional zone. If you are interested, I can take you there.”</p>
<p>“You could have just given me a call. Why did you make the trip yourself?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>The corners of Wang Lu’s eyes twitched as her fingers couldn’t hold back the urge. However, she ultimately suppressed it and said to Zhou Wen, “That dimensional zone is somewhat special. It wasn’t convenient to talk over the phone, so I came by myself.” “What kind of dimensional zone is it?” Zhou Wen was fretting over this problem, so he hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>Wang Lu was somewhat disappointed, but she still said, “I still don’t know the name of that dimensional zone. The location is in Lop</p>
<p>Nur.”</p>
<p>“Lop Nur?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>He had heard of this place before. It was west of the East District. In ancient times, it had the names of Earth’s Ear and the Sea of Death. It was said that many strange and bizarre things had happened there before the dimensional storms descended.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s Lop Nur. There aren’t many dimensional zones there, but it’s very strange. An elder of my race accidentally entered and discovered a dimensional zone…” Wang Lu recounted the situation of the dimensional zone in detail.</p>
<p>The elder from the Wang family had originally gone to the edge of the desert to search for a Companion Beast, but due to an accident, he lost his direction and accidentally entered Lop Nur.</p>
<p>Lop Nur had been extremely dangerous in ancient times, only to become even stranger and more bizarre after the dimensional storms. Anyone who accidentally entered almost never came out.</p>
<p>The Wang family member originally believed that he was doomed, but to his surprise, he discovered a dimensional zone. After something happened in the dimensional zone, he came out alive.</p>
<p>As for the place he came out from, it was no longer a desert. Instead, it was far away on the other end of another sea. That sea was equally famous. It was the Bermuda Triangle known as the Devil’s Triangle.</p>
<p>The Wang family member couldn’t explain what was going on. Many of his experiences were things he didn’t understand, but there were some key experiences that confirmed that he had experienced some special spatial powers.</p>
<p>There were no dimensional creatures in the dimensional zone, but no matter where he went, he would ultimately return to the same place. This wasn’t the bizarre part. What was bizarre were the marks he had left behind.</p>
<p>After realizing that he was lost, the Wang family member left a lighter somewhere and continued walking. After walking for some time, he saw the lighter again. What was even stranger was that he realized that he had an additional lighter on him.</p>
<p>He only had one lighter and had already placed it on the ground as a mark. It was impossible for there to be a second one. However, when he saw his lighter, he subconsciously touched his pocket to find another lighter inside. When he took it out and saw that it was identical to the lighter on the ground, he was shocked.</p>
<p>The Wang family member threw both lighters to the ground. After circling around, he found himself having another lighter.</p>
<p>After circling the area a few times, a pile of lighters appeared in front of him. All the lighters were identical in every way. Even he couldn’t tell which was his original lighter.</p>
<p>“In that case, I’m afraid that it’s no longer just spatial powers. It’s very likely related to the power of spacetime.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and asked, “How did he walk out later? How did he reach Bermuda?”</p>
<p>“He doesn’t know.” Wang Lu shook her head and said, “He fainted in the end. When he woke up, he was already on a beach.”</p>
<p>“That’s interesting,” Zhou Wen said in thought.</p>
<p>“Our family plans on exploring that dimensional zone. If you are interested, you can join us,” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>“Alright, count me in.” Zhou Wen felt that this dimensional zone was really odd. Perhaps it was really compatible with the Godfiend Era. Even if he didn’t enter, he could try to find the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>Even if it wasn’t compatible with Godfiend Era, he had to make a trip to help Wang Lu.</p>
<p>The two of them chatted for a while longer. After setting a time and about how she couldn’t stay long because her family was preparing to explore the dimensional zone, Wang Lu returned to the Wang family.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, are you stupid? Did your head get kicked by a donkey when you were young?” Li Xuan was rendered speechless when he heard Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>Li Xuan sighed and said, “You are a beast. You wasted Wang Lu’s efforts.” “What’s wrong? Wang Lu wants to explore the dimensional zone. Didn’t I agree to help her?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Need your help? Don’t you get ashamed? With Wang Lu’s luck, would she need your help? Besides, do you know what she meant by raising that matter? Leaving something behind allows another item to appear. Furthermore, it can be infinitely replicated. If one doesn’t throw the lighter, but a high-level Companion Egg or skill crystal, do you know what that means?” Li Xuan wore a look of disappointment.</p>
<p>“That’s really something I didn’t think of.” Zhou Wen was immediately taken aback. He immediately understood the true value of the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Even if there were no other discoveries, just using this strange phenomenon could produce unimaginable benefits.</p>
<p>“She has informed you of such a huge secret; yet, you only think that you’re helping her? Are you a beast?” Li Xuan couldn’t help but curse.</p>
<p>“In that case, I really owe Wang Lu a huge favor. I’ll have to repay her in the future,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was rendered speechless as though he couldn’t be bothered to say anything else to Zhou Wen. “Do whatever you want. Anyway, if you let Wang Lu down in the future, as your bro, I’ll definitely be on her side.”</p>
<p>With that said, Li Xuan left. He was afraid that if he continued speaking to Zhou Wen, he wouldn’t be able to help but beat him up.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1741'>Chapter 1741 Wang Lu’s Request</h3>
<p>Over the next few days, alien races plucked the golden apples and appeared on the rankings, but there wasn’t a single human on the rankings. Even human representatives didn’t enter the Cube’s rankings, much less manage to pluck the golden apple.</p>
<p>Even powerful representatives like Mohe didn’t challenge the Cube.</p>
<p>Ordinary people only hoped that humans could enter the rankings, but they didn’t know that the representatives had basically received a warning from the alien races not to challenge the Cube.</p>
<p>There were a total of 37 golden apples on the tree. As the number of golden apples decreased, more and more people hoped that Human Sovereign could challenge it and occupy a spot on the Cube.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t hear their summoning. He followed Wang Lu and company into the strange Lop Nur. The electronic devices here had no signal, so he had no idea what was happening outside.</p>
<p>The boundless desert was a forbidden zone for humans in ancient times. Once one was lost in it, they would die in a few days without having any food or water.</p>
<p>Their group had water-elemental Terror-grade experts, so it wasn’t difficult for them to draw water. They also had plenty of food, so they didn’t need to worry about this. However, this didn’t mean that they could do anything they wanted. Lop Nur became far more terrifying after the dimensional storms, so the group proceeded carefully.</p>
<p>It was unknown if it was because of Wang Lu’s existence, but they encountered zero danger along the way. However, after walking for a few days, they failed to find the dimensional zone the Wang family member mentioned.</p>
<p>“Third Uncle, where should we go now?” Looking at the endless salt plains, Wang Lu frowned and asked the middle-aged man beside her.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man’s name was Wang Huaiduan. In terms of seniority, he was Wang Lu’s third uncle. He was in his forties and was only at the Mythical stage after using the Mythical Serum. He was the one who had discovered the dimensional zone back then.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Family Head. Back then, I accidentally walked into that dimensional zone. I only know that it’s probably in this area. As for where it exactly is, I really have no clue,” Wang Huaiduan said in embarrassment.</p>
<p>Wang Lu had no intention of reprimanding him. It wasn’t surprising that Wang Huaiduan didn’t know the location of the dimensional zone back then. She didn’t expect Wang Huaiduan to remember much. All he needed to do was confirm that it was this area.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. It’s in this area, right?” Wang Lu asked again.</p>
<p>“It should be,” Wang Huaiduan said.</p>
<p>Wang Lu nodded and looked at Zhou Wen who was playing with his phone. “Zhou Wen, lend me one of your shoes.”</p>
<p>“What for?” Sitting on the Great Might Vajra Bull’s back, Zhou Wen took off his shoe and threw it to Wang Lu while asking her.</p>
<p>“Trying my luck.” Wang Lu took Zhou Wen’s shoe and tossed it out. She looked at the tip of the shoe and said, “Let’s go that way.”</p>
<p>With that said, Wang Lu picked up the shoe and returned it to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The Wang family didn’t doubt Wang Lu’s seemingly childish actions as they walked in the direction she had mentioned.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took the shoe and put it on. He looked at Wang Lu curiously and asked, “Why didn’t you use this method previously?”</p>
<p>“Humans can’t have too many extravagant hopes. If they wish for too much fortune that doesn’t belong to them, it might not be a good thing even if they obtain it in the end,” Wang Lu said ambiguously. Zhou Wen nodded. He had some understanding of that.</p>
<p>Although Wang Lu’s luck was amazingly lucky, she wasn’t the Goddess of Luck with boundless divine strength. There was probably a limit to her luck. She might not be able to resolve everything with luck.</p>
<p>If anything could be resolved by luck, Wang Lu would have long become the strongest human. In fact, Wang Lu had yet to advance to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>The group continued on their way. After walking for less than half a day, Wang Huaiduan suddenly pointed ahead and shouted, “There it is. That’s the entrance to the dimensional zone.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked in the direction he was pointing and saw a lake appear on the endless salt plains. The lake wasn’t big, and the water surface was calm like a mirror.</p>
<p>Wang Huaiduan continued excitedly, “See that strange-shaped boulder by the lake? As long as we step past it, we can enter that strange dimensional zone.”</p>
<p>The strange-shaped boulder that Wang Huaiduan mentioned stood more than ten meters tall. Perhaps due to the ravages of the sandstorm, there was a huge crack in the middle of the boulder that could accommodate two people walking side by side.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at the crack on the boulder. Through the crack, he saw the lake behind it. It didn’t seem different.</p>
<p>“Stay here and rest for the night. We’ll explore the dimensional zone tomorrow.” Wang Lu led everyone to the boulder, but she didn’t immediately enter. Looking at the sun that was about to set, she instructed everyone to pitch tents and set up a temporary camp.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen circled the vicinity but didn’t find the tiny palm symbol. All he could do was return to the camp resentfully.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had brought his own tent. While resting at night, he saw Wang Lu pull open the curtain and enter.</p>
<p>“Having problems sleeping?” Zhou Wen asked with a smile.</p>
<p>Wang Lu sat down and shook her head. “I need your help with something.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” The reason Zhou Wen didn’t immediately agree wasn’t because he wanted to consider the pros and cons, but because he felt that if Wang Lu were to look for him now, the matter of asking him for help was probably no trifling matter. He had to treat it seriously and not let down Wang Lu’s request.</p>
<p>Wang Lu took out a box and placed it in front of Zhou Wen. “Help me hold this. After entering the dimensional zone tomorrow, if everything goes smoothly, you can place it somewhere suitable.”</p>
<p>“Could the thing inside be…” Before Zhou Wen could finish his sentence, Wang Lu pressed his lips with her finger.</p>
<p>“You just need to know. I’ll leave the item to you.” With that said, Wang Lu got up and left the tent without staying any longer.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the box in front of him and couldn’t help but frown.</p>
<p>If his guess was right, the box likely contained an important treasure prepared by Wang Lu. It was very likely a high-level Companion Egg. As Companion Beasts couldn’t be too far from their masters, they couldn’t be placed in dimensional zones to replicate them. This was also why Wang Huaiduan hadn’t experimented back then. It was because he didn’t have any Companion Eggs on him, preventing him from experimenting.</p>
<p>The Wang family had come prepared. They had definitely prepared a very high-level Companion Egg or other treasures. However, he didn’t know why Wang Lu had placed the item in the box with him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t open the box to see what it was. He put it away and continued grinding his game dungeons.</p>
<p>The night passed uneventfully. The next morning, the Wang family packed their things and marched through the boulder. Zhou Wen followed the team. At the instant he passed through the crack, the scene in front of him didn’t seem much different from what he had seen before.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1742'>Chapter 1742 Identical</h3>
<p>He clearly saw the Salt Water Lake behind the boulder, but after passing through it, he saw the same Salt Water Lake. It didn’t seem any different.</p>
<p>“Have we really entered a dimensional zone?” someone asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Many people wanted to ask this question. Even Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled. After passing through the stone crack, it didn’t seem any different from before.</p>
<p>“It’s different. Very different,” Wang Huaiduan said with certainty. “If we don’t pass through the crack in this boulder, we will leave this Salt Water Lake no matter where we go. And after passing through the crack in the boulder, no matter where we go, we will ultimately return to the lake. It’s as though we are circling around it.”</p>
<p>“Has the loop already begun?” Zhou Wen asked as he looked around.</p>
<p>“It should have already begun. However, after we leave this place, we won’t be able to see this boulder no matter how we walk. In other words, it’s impossible for us to leave this place.” Wang Huaiduan thought for a moment and said, “At that time, I walked for a long time and couldn’t leave this place. I thought I was doomed. I was exhausted and delirious. Back then, a suction force suddenly appeared in the lake and I was swept in. When I woke up, I was already on the coast of Devil’s Triangle. I don’t know how I got out.”</p>
<p>“Third Uncle, come with us. Zhiyuan, stay in front of the boulder with a team.” Wang Lu instructed calmly, looking somewhat like a family head. She was somewhat different from the Wang Lu Zhou Wen knew.</p>
<p>Apart from leaving a five-person team in front of the boulder, the others followed Wang Lu. Zhou Wen was among them.</p>
<p>This time, the Wang family didn’t leave anything behind. They wanted to see if they could still see the five-person team when they returned.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed them. At the same time, he used the Teacher Domain to scan his surroundings, especially the lake. If there was really anything strange, it was the most likely problem.</p>
<p>However, after scanning for a while, Zhou Wen didn’t discover anything within the Teacher Domain’s range. There didn’t seem to be any creatures in the lake. Ignoring dimensional creatures, he didn’t even discover ordinary microorganisms.</p>
<p>“The salt content in this lake is very high. A person can float in it when jumping in. Previously, I jumped into the lake, hoping to find some dimensional creatures as food, but I didn’t discover anything,” Wang Huaiduan said as he walked.</p>
<p>Wang Lu only listened quietly without saying a word. Everyone stuck to circling the lake without wandering off. After walking for a period of time, they estimated that they had circled the lake once, but they still didn’t see the boulder that they used for entry.</p>
<p>“It’s indeed a little strange.” Zhou Wen frowned slightly. He didn’t sense any changes in space. The boulder and the Wang family members guarding it had vanished. This dimensional zone was indeed not simple.</p>
<p>“Little Li, act according to plan,” Wang Lu said to a youth from the Wang family.</p>
<p>The youth nodded and stayed by the lake. The others continued circling the lake.</p>
<p>The youth had some of the Wang family’s Companion Eggs on him. If he had duplicates of those Companion Eggs when they found him, the Wang family would really make a</p>
<p>killing</p>
<p>“This dimensional zone is indeed a little strange. Be careful,” Zhou Wen walked beside Wang Lu and whispered to her.</p>
<p>He had a nagging feeling that something was amiss. Or rather, this dimensional zone made him uneasy.</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou, don’t worry. The last time I came, I circled this place for a few days and didn’t find any dimensional creatures. I even spent quite some time in the lake. If there were any dimensional creatures, they would have long eaten me,” Wang Huaiduan said.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing wrong with being careful. Everyone, focus,” said Wang Lu. The Wang family members responded and continued circling the lake. Perhaps Zhou Wen was too sensitive, but they didn’t encounter anything along the way.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen guessed that they were about to circle the lake. He focused his gaze forward, hoping to see Little Li.</p>
<p>He saw him. It was similar to when they left. Little Li was sitting by the lake, fiddling with the sand in boredom.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen watched, his expression suddenly changed.</p>
<p>“Little Li is there!” After walking for a while, someone finally saw Little Li and shouted in pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>“Quick, let’s see if the Companion Eggs on him have doubled.” Everyone became excited as they quickened their pace towards Little Li.</p>
<p>As they ran, everyone slowed down again, revealing looks of horror.</p>
<p>This was because they realized that the Little Li sitting there wasn’t one, but two. Two identical Little Lis sat side by side.</p>
<p>The reason Zhou Wen’s expression changed drastically was that he had seen two Little Lis. Furthermore, he couldn’t tell which was the real Little Li under the Teacher Domain. Or rather, both Little Li were real.</p>
<p>“Even humans can be replicated?” Even at a close distance, Zhou Wen still couldn’t tell what was different between the two Little Lis.</p>
<p>At that moment, the two Little Lis also discovered Zhou Wen and company. They immediately got up and ran towards them. As they ran, they shouted, “Family Head… Not good… Something strange happened… There’s an additional me… No… Something is impersonating me…”</p>
<p>There was nothing wrong with what he said. The problem was that the two Little Lis’ words were identical. Even their expressions were identical. Instantly, everyone was stunned.</p>
<p>“Little Li, stand there and don’t move,” Wang Lu said as she stared at the two Little Lis.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, the two Little Lis stopped as though they fully trusted Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“Take out the Companion Eggs you have on you,” Wang Lu continued.</p>
<p>The two Little Lis removed their backpacks and took out the Companion Eggs inside. There were a total of seven Companion Eggs. Each Companion Egg was different, but the Companion Eggs of the duo were identical, like twins.</p>
<p>“I should have known. This godforsaken place can replicate the lighter, so it’s possible to replicate humans as well. We shouldn’t have left Little Li here,” Wang Huaiduan said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“Family Head, Third Uncle, quickly think of a way. I don’t want to have two of me,” the two Little Lis said with a sullen expression.</p>
<p>Wang Lu was momentarily at a loss. She couldn’t tell which Little Li was the original Little Li. She couldn’t help but look at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head slightly. He couldn’t tell which Little Li was real either.</p>
<p>“Leave the Companion Eggs here now. Let’s continue walking.” Wang Lu thought for a moment and got someone to put down the Companion Eggs they had brought along. Then, she took the two Little Lis along and continued circling the lake.</p>
<p>Now, they really didn’t dare to leave a human here. They couldn’t even deal with the two Little Lis. If they ended up making a few more Little Lis, his wife would probably be in a difficult position when he returned.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1743'>Chapter 1743 No Replication</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen did have the urge to replicate the good things on him; it would be crazy if he could replicate a few items like the mysterious phone.</p>
<p>Even if the mysterious phone couldn’t be replicated, it would be awesome to have a few Immortal Culling Swords and Immortal Peril Swords.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen didn’t really do so. He had to figure out what was going on with this dimensional zone before he dared to experiment with the Immortal Culling Sword. Otherwise, if something went wrong, it wouldn’t be worth it.</p>
<p>Looking at the two Little Lis in the team, Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that something was amiss. If anything could be replicated to obtain endless benefits, wasn’t this dimensional zone a little too powerful?</p>
<p>The Wang family was actually very uneasy. The benefits involved were just too great-so great that it was unbelievable.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t because Wang Lu had extremely powerful luck, they might not have dared to come despite knowing the benefits.</p>
<p>Everyone in the group had their own thoughts as they circled the Salt Water Lake again. When they arrived at the area where they had left their luggage, they indeed discovered two identical piles of luggage.</p>
<p>When they opened the luggage, everything was duplicated. However, only one item of the things that Little Li had replicated previously appeared.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, there are two possibilities. One possibility is that the replica can’t be replicated. The second possibility is that the same item will only have one replicated,” Zhou Wen muttered to himself.</p>
<p>“It’s fine replicating one at a time. One each time means that doing it ten times gets ten. If we stay here for a few days, we won’t lack any Companion Beasts. The Wang family’s rise is just around the corner…” The Wang family was extremely excited.</p>
<p>Some people had already experimented with hatching a replicated Companion Egg-the outcome was identical to a normal Companion Egg.</p>
<p>At this moment, no one doubted the value of replicating Companion Eggs. They only wanted to replicate more Companion Eggs and things.</p>
<p>The only person who was more vexed was Little Li. The authenticity of the two Little Lis couldn’t be determined. All they could do was temporarily watch the duo to prevent any trouble.</p>
<p>“Family Head, there’s no mistake about it. This dimensional zone is our Wang family’s blessed land. Leave everything you brought behind and try your best to replicate more things. Who knows if there will be a time limit here…” an elder from the Wang family said to Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“There’s no rush. Let’s stick to the original plan and leave a portion behind.” Wang Lu shook her head.</p>
<p>Some wanted to persuade Wang Lu otherwise, but she cut them off. “The plan is to protect the family’s interests. If we don’t act according to the plan, who will be responsible if anything happens?”</p>
<p>The members of the Wang family looked at each other. In the end, they followed Wang Lu’s orders and left a portion behind before circling the lake again.</p>
<p>“What are your thoughts?” Wang Lu walked beside Zhou Wen and asked softly.</p>
<p>“This is very likely a spacetime dimensional zone as expected. I left a few low-level Companion Eggs there. I should discover something next time,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Wang Lu asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Wang Lu had noticed Zhou Wen placing a few Companion Eggs there. The Companion Eggs had also been replicated. There would be another additional one when they returned. There didn’t seem to be any difference, so she didn’t know what Zhou Wen was referring to.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen explained, “I only left one of those Companion Eggs and replicated Companion Eggs there.”</p>
<p>Wang Lu was extremely smart. Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, she immediately understood. “You left a portion of original Companion Eggs and a portion of replicated Companion Eggs. If all the Companion Eggs are replicated again, it means that there’s no limit to the replication. However, the same item can produce one replicated item. If a portion of the Companion Eggs aren’t replicated, that means that the replicas can’t be replicated.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded and said, “If it’s really the power of spacetime that’s at work, then be it the original or a replica, they should be replicated. No, it shouldn’t be said that it’s a replica. Or rather, it’s better to describe it as a parallel space. Those things come from a parallel space and not a replica. If the replica isn’t replicated, it’s hard to make further determination. Of course, it’s only a guess now. We still have to see the outcome.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you tempted at all when you see the replicated items?” Wang Lu asked as she sized up Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>At this moment, Zhou Wen was still able to come up with such ideas without being affected. It left Wang Lu alarmed.</p>
<p>Wang Lu’s luck was excellent. She usually didn’t lack anything, but when she saw the replicated items, her will wavered. The reason she insisted on following the plan was just to be safe.</p>
<p>Even so, she wasn’t as calm as Zhou Wen. “Yes, how can I not be? However…” Zhou Wen seemed to hesitate and didn’t finish his sentence.</p>
<p>“Just say it if it’s convenient. If it’s not convenient, don’t say it,” said Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing inconvenient. I’m just afraid that you will think too much,” Zhou Wen said after some thought. “Then just say it. I’ll definitely believe you,” Wang Lu said seriously.</p>
<p>“I’m just afraid that I’ll believe in it myself. I’d rather it be wrong.” Zhou Wen smiled bitterly and continued without waiting for Wang Lu to press further, “To be honest, according to my past experience, something will happen every time I enter an unfamiliar dimensional zone. It’s rather harrowing every time, so no matter how tempted I am, I still have my scruples.”</p>
<p>“I was wondering what it was. You gave me a fright. Don’t worry. With me by your side, your luck will turn for the better,” said Wang Lu with a smile.</p>
<p>“I’m not worried. I’m just afraid that you will be worried,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>The two of them chatted as they walked. After circling the area for a long time, everyone approached the place where the items were placed. Zhou Wen saw the pile of items from afar. The Companion Eggs he had placed were among them.</p>
<p>One… Two… Six… That’s not right… Half of them haven’t been replicated… Zhou Wen counted silently in his heart and couldn’t help but frown.</p>
<p>According to his previous guess, if it were spatial powers at work, the Companion Eggs he had left behind should have produced new ones, be it the original or replicas. However, half of them had clearly not been replicated.</p>
<p>“The replicas cannot be replicated? In other words, only the original will be replicated. Is this a spacetime power?” Wang Lu also saw Zhou Wen’s Companion Eggs and immediately knew what had happened.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1744'>Chapter 1744 Problem</h3>
<p>“I don’t know.” Zhou Wen shook his head slightly and stared thoughtfully at the Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>However, the members of the Wang family had already rushed to their luggage in euphoria. They only needed to circle around to obtain many precious Companion Eggs. The things that they had risked their lives for in the past could now be obtained by taking a stroll. Anyone would be excited to the point of losing control</p>
<p>“Family Head, there’s no mistake about it. Everything is correct. Stop hesitating. Leave that thing behind. We don’t know what will happen in the future. Let’s quickly get a few more while we can.” A few elders from the Wang family came over to persuade Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“Stick to the plan; it will be done in the next round. There’s no rush,” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>“The plan is set by humans. We can be more flexible when needed. There’s no need to be so inflexible. If we had left that thing behind earlier, there would be three of them now. Apart from you, we can also have one…” The elder didn’t finish his sentence, but Zhou Wen understood.</p>
<p>The Wang family probably had a special Companion Egg or treasure, but they were afraid of any accidents, so they didn’t dare leave it there.</p>
<p>Now that the Wang family saw the items being replicated again and again, they couldn’t help but want Wang Lu to replicate more of that item so that they could also have a copy. “As long as it can be replicated, everyone will naturally have a share. There’s only one round left. Let’s go,” Wang Lu said as she continued on her way, not giving those people a chance to speak.</p>
<p>The few elders were somewhat helpless, but they didn’t say anything else. They packed their things and continued on their way with Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“Did you discover anything?” Wang Lu asked when she saw Zhou Wen frowning in thought.</p>
<p>“Not really, but I thought of something. If I want to determine which one is the original Little Li, we can leave one there and see if he will be replicated to know if he’s the original,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“If it’s the original version, wouldn’t there be another Little Li?” Wang Lu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen laughed as well. “That’s why it’s just a thought. Actually, there’s no point in distinguishing them. Even if you know who’s the replica, you can’t be heartless enough to kill him, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Although he’s a replica, he’s no different from Little Li. We grew up together, so how can we bear to do it? Unless he’s not Little Li…” Wang Lu said gloomily.</p>
<p>“If it’s not Little Li, what else could it be?” As Zhou Wen spoke, he turned to look at the two Little Lis. When he saw them, his expression suddenly changed.</p>
<p>As the other members of the Wang family were excited, all of them wanted to walk faster. In the beginning, they had paid special attention to the two Little Lis, but now, the two had unknowingly fallen to the back. No one wanted to watch them.</p>
<p>The two Little Lis were originally identical, but now, one of them had changed at some point in time.</p>
<p>Little Li was only in his twenties. His eyes were rather big, and he had black oriental-styled irises. However, now that one Little Li had his head lowered, his eyes had turned completely white like a blind person.</p>
<p>From the point of view of an ordinary person, there were only a few differences. However, in Zhou Wen’s eyes, Little Li emitted a strange aura that resembled white smoke rising from his body.</p>
<p>Oh no, there’s something wrong with the replica. Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>The Little Li who had his head lowered suddenly looked up and revealed a strange smile at Zhou Wen. In the next moment, he pounced on the other Little Li beside him.</p>
<p>As the duo were too close, Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to do anything. The moment the two Little Li came into contact, they seemed to fuse together, turning from two to</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already flashed in front of Little Li, but he didn’t know what was happening. It was naturally impossible for him to directly kill him. All he did was reach out to grab Little Li’s arm and restrain him.</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou, what are you doing?” Upon hearing the commotion behind, the Wang family stopped and looked over. Seeing Zhou Wen grab Little Li’s arm, they looked at him in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Don’t you realize that one Little Li is missing?” Zhou Wen stared at Little Li and said.</p>
<p>As they were too excited, everyone had long forgotten about Little Li. Only when Zhou Wen mentioned it did they recall.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Why is there only one Little Li? Where did the other Little Li go? Don’t tell me he ran off?” Everyone looked around but didn’t find the other Little Li.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, what’s going on?” Wang Lu hadn’t seen the scene, so she didn’t know that the two Little Li had fused into one.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen recounted what he had seen while observing Little Li’s reaction.</p>
<p>Little Li was very honest. He allowed Zhou Wen to grab him without moving or struggling. His eyes looked a little demented.</p>
<p>Everyone was puzzled when they heard that. They sized up Little Li, but no matter how they looked at it, they couldn’t imagine how the two of them had fused into one.</p>
<p>“There’s something wrong with the replicas here. We can’t continue replicating them,” Zhou Wen said to Wang Lu.</p>
<p>Before Wang Lu could say anything, an elder from the Wang family said in a strange tone, “Mr. Zhou, did the two Little Lis really fuse into one?”</p>
<p>“I saw it with my own eyes,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“There are so many people here. Why are you the only one who saw it? Isn’t it too much of a coincidence that no one else saw it?” The elder snorted coldly.</p>
<p>“Uncle Liu, what do you mean?” Wang Lu said unhappily.</p>
<p>“Family Head, I’ve already said that we should keep this matter private. However, you refused to listen and insisted on letting an outsider follow. Now, he can’t stand that our Wang family will be doing well. Family Head, what do you think we should do?” the elder said angrily.</p>
<p>“Uncle Liu, what are you trying to say?” Wang Lu frowned.</p>
<p>“None of us saw the two Little Lis fuse into one. Only Mr. Zhou saw it. He even said with certainty that there’s a problem with the replica and that we can’t continue replicating. Don’t you think that there’s a problem with this? Even if the two Little Lis really fused into one, it doesn’t mean that we can’t continue replicating. Wouldn’t using one of the replicas before they fuse work? Why can’t we continue replicating? I think it’s because someone doesn’t want our Wang family to do well and is deliberately making things difficult for us. It’s hard to tell if the other Little Li had fused or met with misfortune thanks to someone.”</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen doesn’t lie,” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>“One can never judge a book by its cover. Family Head, you are still young. There are some things that you haven’t seen through. In front of absolute benefits, what can people not do?” The elder was rather friendly to Wang Lu, but not towards Zhou Wen. “Even if the two Little Lis have fused into one, he should be able to speak, right? If we ask him ourselves, won’t the truth be out? What’s the point of restraining him?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1745'>Chapter 1745 Why Are You Smiling?</h3>
<p>“What questions do you have? You can ask them now.” Zhou Wen didn’t let go of Little Li’s hand.</p>
<p>“He’s already half-dead from your grabbing. How are we to ask?” A Wang family member said, “Let him go first. There are so many of us. Are you afraid that he will escape?”</p>
<p>“I’m not afraid of him running. I’m just afraid that he won’t run.” Zhou Wen didn’t let go of Little Li.</p>
<p>“Family Head, what’s going on? No matter what, Little Li is a subordinate of our Wang family. Even if we want to arrest and question him, it should be done by our Wang family. Why leave this to an outsider?” the elder said unhappily to Wang Lu. “That’s right. Why are the other things we replicated fine except for Little Li? Furthermore, he’s clearly fine. He looks half-dead and can’t even speak because he’s being held hostage. I’m afraid someone is up to no good.”</p>
<p>“People from the Wang family should naturally be dealt with by the Wang family itself.”</p>
<p>Many people from the Wang family were somewhat displeased with Zhou Wen, but they didn’t dare make a move. They also knew that Zhou Wen was powerful and wasn’t someone ordinary people could match.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, what’s Little Li’s situation now?” Wang Lu asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Although Wang Lu was the head of the family, that didn’t mean that she could ignore the Wang family’s feelings. If people lost their sense of belonging, the family would be over.</p>
<p>Wang Lu believed Zhou Wen, but she had to placate the Wang family members’ emotions.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure either. I just feel that something is amiss.” Zhou Wen looked at the demented Little Li and recalled his smile. He had a nagging feeling that this fellow was dangerous.</p>
<p>“Heard that? What kind of answer is that? Can you hold a member of our Wang family hostage just because you feel that something is amiss?”</p>
<p>“Family Head, he can’t even give a reason. Is this how people do things?”</p>
<p>When the Wang family heard Zhou Wen’s words, they became even more distrustful of him. They only believed that he had ulterior motives.</p>
<p>Wang Lu was in a dilemma, but she didn’t relent. Zhou Wen could tell that Wang Lu was in a difficult position. After some thought, he said, “Forget it. Since you want him, I’ll give him to you. However, if anything happens, it won’t be my business.”</p>
<p>“We don’t need outsiders to worry about the Wang family,” the Wang family members immediately said.</p>
<p>With Wang Lu around, they felt that nothing would happen with her luck.</p>
<p>Desire is really a terrifying emotion, Zhou Wen thought to himself. If it were any other time, these people wouldn’t dare speak to me like that. But in the face of so many benefits, they aren’t afraid of offending me. Forget it. It’s not like I can keep holding onto Little Li. I can take this opportunity to see what’s so strange about him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen no longer held back Little Li and returned him to the Wang family.</p>
<p>Two Wang family members took Little Li from Zhou Wen’s hands. Although they had some concerns and were afraid that there was something wrong with him, they felt relieved when they saw that he appeared demented.</p>
<p>“Little Li…” After getting Little Li back, the Wang family wanted to wake him up and ask him about what had happened, but Little Li remained silent. He seemed to be in a daze and nothing could be got out of him.</p>
<p>Many people still suspected that Zhou Wen had secretly done something to Little Li. They didn’t believe the words of the two Little Lis fusing into one. If they didn’t know Zhou Wen’s strength, they would probably have taken him down before interrogating him.</p>
<p>“Family Head, I don’t think there’s any problem. Aren’t the replicated Companion Eggs fine? In any case, we aren’t replicating people. It should be fine. Let’s not waste any more time. Let’s continue.”</p>
<p>Everyone urged Wang Lu to quickly put down the treasure prepared by the Wang family and replicate a few more.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Wang Lu nodded and took out a box from her backpack and placed it on the pile of things.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched coldly from the side. This time, he didn’t say a word.</p>
<p>Everyone set off again and circled the Salt Water Lake. Although there were also people who were worried that something would go wrong, their desire for treasures exceeded their worries.</p>
<p>Along the way, Zhou Wen observed Little Li. He was escorted forward by two members of the Wang family, but there was no reaction.</p>
<p>When they returned to the place where they had placed the items, there was indeed another pile of replicas. The box that Wang Lu had taken out was also among them. “See? I knew it. There’s no problem. Isn’t everything fine?”</p>
<p>“Let’s go, let’s go. Let’s replicate a few more. It’s best if we can each obtain one…”</p>
<p>“With this treasure land, our Wang family will definitely become an existence like the six families in the future.”</p>
<p>They were all in a festive mood, as though they would soon become great nobles on Earth.</p>
<p>Wang Lu didn’t say a word as she looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Continue walking,” Zhou Wen said indifferently. It was useless to say anything else now. Furthermore, he couldn’t leave, so he could only continue walking.</p>
<p>Round after round, more and more things were replicated.</p>
<p>Ignoring the Wang family’s delight, Zhou Wen found it odd.</p>
<p>He had clearly seen the two Little Lis fuse into one, but the replicated Companion Eggs didn’t do the same.</p>
<p>Even the box that Wang Lu had put down had been replicated multiple times. There were no strange fusions.</p>
<p>As for the item in the box, Zhou Wen also knew what it was. In the Wang family’s euphoria, someone had accidentally revealed it, Zhou Wen knew that it was a Calamity-grade Companion Egg. With the Wang family’s standards, they likely didn’t have the ability to hunt Calamity-grade creatures. It was highly likely that Wang Lu had obtained it through luck.</p>
<p>After circling so many times, Little Li remained in a daze. He didn’t do anything out-of-place.</p>
<p>Could it be that something will happen only after living creatures are replicated? Or could it be that only humans have problems? Zhou Wen thought of all sorts of possibilities.</p>
<p>They walked to the place where the items were placed again. Indeed, there was another pile of items there. The Wang family was so happy that they were about to go crazy.</p>
<p>Many replicated Companion Eggs had been hatched by the Wang family—they were also fine.</p>
<p>As for the Calamity Companion Egg box, no one had taken it. Firstly, they needed Wang Lu’s permission. Secondly, even if they took it now, they wouldn’t be able to hatch it.</p>
<p>The Wang family didn’t even have a single Calamity-grade creature. Just their Essence Energy was insufficient to incubate a Calamity Companion Beast. If they forced the hatching, they would only die from having their Essence Energy sucked dry. Therefore, no one requested to hatch it now.</p>
<p>Wang Lu only put away the replicated box every time without any intention of incubating it.</p>
<p>As everyone was feeling excited, Zhou Wen saw the dazed Little Li finally show an expression. He revealed a strange smile again, but other than Zhou Wen, no one was paying attention to him.</p>
<p>This time, he didn’t stop smiling. He kept smiling, making Zhou Wen’s hair stand on end.</p>
<p>“Little Li, are you awake? Why are you smiling?” The Wang family members who were escorting Little Li finally realized that something was amiss with him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1746'>Chapter 1746 The Strange Little Li</h3>
<p>Little Li still didn’t say a word. He only smiled at the person, making the person’s hair stand on end.</p>
<p>When the others heard the voice, they looked over. However, what they saw next was extremely strange and terrifying.</p>
<p>The person grabbing Little Li’s hand sank into his body as though his body wasn’t made of flesh but sand.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Everything happened too quickly. The person only had time to scream before most of his body fused into Little Li’s body.</p>
<p>A few members of the Wang family rushed over to stop the person from sinking further. However, when their hands touched the person’s body, it was as though they had been electrocuted. Their eyes rolled back as their bodies trembled non-stop. The few of them connected together and sank into Little Li’s body.</p>
<p>“No good!” Wang Lu was alarmed as she immediately released her Companion Beasts to pull them away.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast that resembled a polar bear grabbed their bodies and tried to pull them out.</p>
<p>However, exerting strength failed to pull the people out. Only half of the body was pulled out. The rest had already sunk into Little Li’s body.</p>
<p>Looking at the blood on the ground and the strange smile on Little Li’s face, everyone felt their scalps tingle. A chill rose from the soles of their feet to their heads.</p>
<p>“We can only kill him now,” Zhou Wen said when he saw Wang Lu still hesitating.</p>
<p>Wang Lu had become the head of the Wang family because she had extremely lucky abilities. However, in terms of personality, she was excessively kind and hated killing. In this era, she wasn’t the best leader.</p>
<p>The Wang family also knew that Wang Lu’s personality was too docile. It was only because they needed her luck to bring luck to the family that they had no choice but to let her become the family head.</p>
<p>“He’s no longer Little Li. Kill him,” Wang Lu ordered through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>The elders of the Wang family had long had the intent to kill. Just as Wang Lu said that, a few people released their Companion Beasts and charged at Little Li.</p>
<p>However, when the Companion Beasts pounced at Little Li, a strange scene happened. One Companion Beast after another sank into Little Li’s body like the others.</p>
<p>“What the hell. The family head’s Companion Beast was clearly fine…” The few elders tried their best to retrieve their Companion Beasts, but how could they? They were instantly sucked into Little Li’s body.</p>
<p>No one dared to release their Companion Beasts again. All of them desperately released sword beams and saber beams at Little Li.</p>
<p>However, the sword beams and saber beams also sank into Little Li’s body. Now, Little Li didn’t seem to have a body of flesh and blood, but a black hole. Anything that approached him would be sucked in.</p>
<p>Instantly, everyone stopped and didn’t dare attack Little Li. They looked at him in horror.</p>
<p>They looked at Little Li, but the motionless Little Li suddenly moved. He charged at a member of the Wang family like a ghost, his face still wearing the same mask-like smile.</p>
<p>The person wanted to dodge, but his speed was much slower than Little Li’s. All he could do was summon his Companion Beast to block, but the Companion Beast was grabbed by Little Li’s hand. His head was also grabbed by Little Li’s other hand before the man and pet were sucked into his body.</p>
<p>Monster! This word appeared in everyone’s minds as their first thought was to escape.</p>
<p>Upon encountering such a redoubtable monster, their psychological defense had already collapsed. They had no intention of fighting at all. All that was left was fear. They wanted to stay as far away from the monster as possible.</p>
<p>In fact, even if they wanted to fight, they would only be slaughtered by Little Li.</p>
<p>“None of you are allowed to run.” Zhou Wen flicked his sleeve and pulled the few people running ahead flying back.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, do you want our Wang family dead?” Wang Huaiduan shouted sternly.</p>
<p>“Have we forgotten how this monster came about? If you run in all directions, you will return from different directions. Then, what about the people who aren’t with you? Will they be replicated?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>In fact, what Zhou Wen said was very simple. If everyone was separated and found themselves back in the same spot from different directions, all of them would be replicated relative to the others. That would be a mess.</p>
<p>Although such a situation might not happen, Zhou Wen couldn’t take the risk.</p>
<p>“Run in one direction.” Wang Lu was the first to react.</p>
<p>Only then did everyone understand. However, a few more people were sucked into Little Li’s body during this process. Little Li continued lunging at the others.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to run. Wang Lu, try using your Companion Beast to stop him,” Zhou Wen said to Wang Lu.</p>
<p>When Wang Lu heard Zhou Wen’s words, she didn’t hesitate and ordered the white bear to charge at Little Li.</p>
<p>Previously, many people had used Companion Beasts. No matter what kind of Companion Beast it was, they ended up fusing with Little Li’s body. However, Little Li dodged the white bear’s charge, preventing it from touching his body. “Why doesn’t he dare touch the white bear? Is it because the white bear’s stats restrain him?” Wang Lu was slightly taken aback before she looked at Zhou Wen in pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s the white bear’s stats that restrain it, but you,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“Me?” Wang Lu looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“This is only my speculation. You are the only one who hasn’t replicated a Companion Egg in the Wang family, right? I believe that’s the key,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You mean…” Wang Lu’s expression turned ugly; she wasn’t happy because of that.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen’s guess was right, it meant that there was something wrong with the replicas. The white bear kept chasing Little Li, but Little Li’s movement technique was extremely strange. The Terror-grade white bear couldn’t catch up to him, but it also caused Little Li some trouble, preventing him from chasing others.</p>
<p>The Wang family secretly heaved a sigh of relief when they saw the white bear hold back Little Li. However, before they could finish venting their anger, their expressions turned even uglier.</p>
<p>Little Li didn’t chase after them again, but he pounced at the things piled on the ground.</p>
<p>There were all sorts of Companion Eggs and treasures there. After Little Li plunged into the items, his body was like a magnet. The things approached him with all their might and strangely fused into his body.</p>
<p>“It’s over! It’s all over!” The Wang family was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Everything, including the original Companion Eggs and the replicated Companion Eggs, fused with Little Li’s body. It looked like nothing would be left behind.</p>
<p>Little Li’s body seemed to undergo a strange change as he absorbed a large number of items.</p>
<p>His black hair became whiter and whiter, and his eyes were like the white eyes of the blind. Furthermore, they became whiter and whiter as though light was gathering inside.</p>
<p>Now, many members of the Wang family were filled with regret. If they had known this would happen, they wouldn’t have doubted Zhou Wen. They would have long finished the scourge that was Little Li.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1747'>Chapter 1747 Spacetime Strength</h3>
<p>Everyone only wanted to escape, but they knew that escaping was useless. Ignoring the question of whether there would be more monsters similar to Little Li, there was no way to escape. No matter how they ran, they would ultimately return. They would ultimately die.</p>
<p>Wang Lu controlled the white bear to charge at the monster, Little Li, who was fusing with various items. This time, the monster, Little Li, didn’t dodge. Looking at the roaring white bear, he suddenly extended his hand and pressed down on the white bear’s open mouth.</p>
<p>The Terror-grade white bear was pressed to the ground. No matter how much it struggled, it couldn’t get up.</p>
<p>In the next second, the spot where the white bear’s palm touched the monster, Little Li, sank into his palm like the other things.</p>
<p>“My Companion Beast won’t do either!” Wang Lu was alarmed. She wanted to retrieve the white bear, but how could she? Moments later, the white bear was sucked into Little Li’s palm.</p>
<p>Little Li’s entire body suffused a strange white light, especially his hair and eyes. It was indescribably strange.</p>
<p>The members of the Wang family turned ashen. They originally wanted to count on Wang Lu’s Companion Beast, but now, it was useless. They immediately felt that they had lost their crutch.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned as he looked at Little Li. The Teacher Domain constantly circulated as it analyzed the nomological powers on Little Li’s body, but the speed of its analysis was extremely slow.</p>
<p>However, he was certain that Little Li had the laws of time and space, but there were some differences. Perhaps it was the legendary spacetime power.</p>
<p>In a moment, the piles of items were sucked into Little Li’s body. Little Li’s body, which emitted a strange white light, levitated off the ground. His entire body was like a white devil enveloped by a demonic glow. His white hair hung down, turning into white eyes that seemed to reflect the sins of the world.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, what should we do?” Wang Lu was at a loss. The situation had exceeded her control.</p>
<p>“Kill him.” Zhou Wen condensed the power of Great Brahma and his body was immediately enveloped by the dark-gold armor as he threw a punch at the monster, Little Li.</p>
<p>The destructive beam struck the monstrous Little Li’s body. The power was enough to destroy a Calamity-grade expert, but when the beam struck the monster, it passed through it without causing any damage to his body.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Zhou Wen take action, the members of the Wang family, who had thought of him as a powerhouse, felt their hearts turn cold. They didn’t care about anything else as they fled. They knew that they couldn’t escape, but every second they lived counted.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen threw punch after punch. The destructive power of the Great Burning Heaven failed to touch the monstrous Little Li. It passed through his body as though it didn’t exist.</p>
<p>Little Li’s figure flashed and vanished from everyone’s sight. When he appeared again, he grabbed the head of a Wang family member with each hand and instantly sucked them into his body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen switched Essence Energy Arts and attempted to attack the monstrous Little Li with different powers. However, no matter what kind of power it was, it felt as though he had struck nothing. It passed through his body without causing any damage.</p>
<p>Instead, it was the monstrous Little Li who instant transmitted again and again. He grabbed the Wang family members who had fled in all directions and sucked them into his body.</p>
<p>Wang Lu summoned Companion Beasts to charge at the monstrous Little Li, but they were no longer effective. They were also sucked into the monster’s body.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, I shouldn’t have brought you here.” Wang Lu sighed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen said, “Let’s cut out the banal chatter. This fellow is indeed a little troublesome. If I’m not wrong, this fellow should be a product of spacetime powers. His strength should have already reached the Calamity grade, but my strength should be stronger than his. That’s why he can’t directly absorb my strength. However, because he has spacetime powers, it’s difficult for my strength to hit his body. This is somewhat troublesome.”</p>
<p>“Why can’t you hit him?” Wang Lu hurriedly asked, hoping to help Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“According to my guess, he should be able to switch to different spacetimes at will. It looks like my strength hit him, but in fact, he’s already in a different spacetime. No matter how strong I am, I can’t penetrate spacetime and hit him in another spacetime…” Zhou Wen explained.</p>
<p>“Then is there no other way?” Wang Lu was burning with anxiety. “Unless I also have spacetime powers and can break through the restrictions of spacetime, I ultimately won’t be able to do a thing to him. Unfortunately, I only have spatial powers and not temporal powers, much less spacetime powers,” Zhou Wen said with a sigh.</p>
<p>Wang Lu felt even more despair when she heard that. She watched as the Wang family members were absorbed by the monstrous Little Li one by one. She said tragically, “I don’t have spacetime powers either, nor do I have spacetime Companion Beasts. From the looks of it, we are doomed.”</p>
<p>“Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen pondered and said, “You just reminded me of something.”</p>
<p>“You have a spacetime-type Companion Beast?” Wang Lu was overjoyed.</p>
<p>“No.” Zhou Wen shook his head.</p>
<p>“You…” Wang Lu was at a loss. She felt that she should be angry, but at this point in time, there was no point in being mad.</p>
<p>“However, I have a strange Companion Beast. Perhaps I can give it a try.” Zhou Wen wasn’t worried that he would die here.</p>
<p>He had already noticed something. The monstrous Little Li had grown by absorbing the things here, but up to now, there weren’t any Calamity-grade Companion Eggs. There were no Calamity-grade Companion Eggs among the replicated items.</p>
<p>Even if he absorbed everything here, he would at most be at the Calamity grade. It was impossible for him to advance to the Apocalypse grade. Even if Zhou Wen couldn’t kill him, he couldn’t do a thing to him.</p>
<p>As for the box Wang Lu had placed there previously, Zhou Wen guessed that it was empty. Perhaps it wasn’t a Calamity-grade Companion Egg inside. The real Calamity-grade Companion Egg was inside the box Wang Lu had given him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat impressed with Wang Lu’s foresight. If Wang Lu really placed the Calamity-grade Companion Egg there for replication, resulting in many replicated Calamity Companion Eggs that ended up absorbed by the monstrous Little Li, who knew what level of growth he would have.</p>
<p>“Then quickly give it a try!” Wang Lu said anxiously.</p>
<p>“Alright.” With a thought, an extremely black shadow-like Companion Beast appeared in front of him. It was none other than the Mystic Thearch Companion Beast he had just obtained.</p>
<p>“I hope it will be useful.” Zhou Wen ordered Mystic Thearch to attack the monstrous Little Li.</p>
<p>Mystic Thearch was a very strange Companion Beast. It didn’t have any skills, but its other stats were top-notch. However, Zhou Wen had previously attempted to get the Mystic Thearch to fight, but he realized that it wasn’t a Strength-type melee Companion Beast.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1748'>Chapter 1748 Mystic Thearch</h3>
<p>Mystic Thearch seemed to have an invisible weapon in hand. Every time it flashed, it would kill a dimensional creature. It was very strange.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hadn’t had the time to do further research before following Wang Lu to Lop Nur. Therefore, Zhou Wen didn’t completely understand Mystic Thearch’s abilities.</p>
<p>However, after seeing the monstrous Little Li, Zhou Wen had a guess. Could Mystic Thearch’s ability be related to spatial powers?</p>
<p>Of course, it was only related. The Mystic Thearch’s power wasn’t spacetime. At the very least, it wasn’t ordinary spacetime power.</p>
<p>Mystic Thearch was dressed in extremely black armor like a shadow female samurai. Her body resembled Starlady Polestar.</p>
<p>When the monstrous Little Li saw Mystic Thearch, it was unknown if he knew that his strength was inferior or if there was another reason, but he actually instant transmitted elsewhere.</p>
<p>However, at the same time he instant transmitted, Mystic Thearch appeared beside him like a ghost and swept past monstrous Little Li.</p>
<p>The white light over monstrous Little Li’s body changed as his entire body turned illusory and unreal. It was as though he had entered another spacetime. He didn’t seem to be injured.</p>
<p>Is Mystic Thearch’s power equally ineffective? Zhou Wen frowned slightly.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen thought that he needed to think of another solution, he saw Mystic Thearch charge at the monstrous Little Li again. However, this time, she didn’t directly hit him; she only waved her right hand like a saber.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately widened his eyes. Under the gaze of the Teacher Domain and himself, he clearly saw the spacetime powers on the monstrous Little Li being sliced apart.</p>
<p>It was an indescribable feeling. It was as though there was a layer of transparent tempered glass between monstrous Little Li and Mystic Thearch. Mystic Thearch’s slash split the transparent barrier into two, or rather, opened up a door.</p>
<p>This was only what Zhou Wen felt. The average person would think that Mystic Thearch had casually waved her hand as though nothing had happened.</p>
<p>With that wave, the Mystic Thearch stepped forward and swept past the monstrous Little Li.</p>
<p>In the next second, the monstrous Little Li’s head flew into the air as though it had been sliced off by a sharp blade.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The flying head and the falling body exploded at the same time as an illusory transparent blob of light fell.</p>
<p>Zone Core! Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised. He never expected the Zone Core to be in the body.</p>
<p>The moment the monstrous Little Li died, Salt Water Lake seemed to experience an earthquake. It suddenly trembled a few times before everyone realized that the missing entrance boulder had appeared not far away.</p>
<p>The five-person team waiting there also appeared in everyone’s vision.</p>
<p>The Wang family members were alarmed and delighted. They couldn’t be bothered to thank Zhou Wen as they scrambled for the entrance boulder.</p>
<p>Wang Lu looked at Zhou Wen as though she had many things to say, but she was momentarily at a loss for words. Finally, she said, “It’s good to have you around.”</p>
<p>“Why are you standing on ceremony with me? Can I have this Zone Core?” Zhou Wen pointed at the Zone Core and asked.</p>
<p>“It’s all yours,” Wang Lu said in disappointment.</p>
<p>“I do need this item, so I won’t stand on ceremony. If you find a dimensional zone that’s suitable for you in the future, I’ll help you get the Zone Core.” Zhou Wen didn’t stand on ceremony as he picked it up.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. This dimensional zone is a little strange. It seems like that’s not all. Let’s not find ourselves stuck in it again.” Zhou Wen pulled Wang Lu out and rendezvoused with the Wang family in front of the entrance boulder.</p>
<p>The Wang family had suffered heavy losses this time. More than ten Mythical personnel had died, and two were at the Terror grade. More importantly, the Companion Eggs that the Wang family had accumulated for a long time were lost.</p>
<p>However, this was already a rather good outcome. If not for Zhou Wen, they would probably have been wiped out.</p>
<p>Before leaving, Zhou Wen secretly returned the box to Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“Take care.” Zhou Wen patted Wang Lu’s head. He wanted to console her, but he didn’t know what to say. He wasn’t someone who was good at consoling others.</p>
<p>“Take care too.” Wang Lu’s expression was odd.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen turned to leave, Wang Lu suddenly asked, “If I have nowhere to go one day, will you take me in?”</p>
<p>“Of course, but I don’t think you will reach that stage with your luck,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“I’ll remember your words.” Wang Lu seemed a little serious.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t read too much into it. All he wanted to do now was find a safe place and see if the Zone Core could advance Godfiend Era to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>He also had to figure out Mystic Thearch’s abilities as soon as possible. The power displayed by the Mystic Thearch made Zhou Wen think of something very important.</p>
<p>Mystic Thearch tore through spacetime to kill the monstrous Little Li. If this ability was used elsewhere, it would be of great help to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>He used spatial teleportation to return to Guide Ancient City. Zhou Wen returned to his room and eagerly took out the Zone Core before switching to the Godfiend Era Essence Energy Art.</p>
<p>As his Essence Energy Art circulated, the Zone Core in Zhou Wen’s hand transformed into transparent streams of light that seeped into his body from his hands.</p>
<p>At the Cape family in the West District.</p>
<p>“Family Head, there’s news from the East District’s Wang family. Wang Lu and the rest have returned,” the blonde middle-aged man came in front of the Cape family’s family head and said with a strange expression.</p>
<p>“What’s the outcome? Can that dimensional zone really replicate a Companion Egg?” The Cape family head looked up and asked the blonde middle-aged man. Clearly, he thought highly of the matter.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” The blonde middle-aged man smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>“You don’t know? What did the people who infiltrated the Wangs say?” The Cape family head stared at him.</p>
<p>“They didn’t return. Apparently, they died in Lop Nur,” the blonde middle-aged man said.</p>
<p>“None of them returned alive?” The Cape family head frowned.</p>
<p>“No, none of them returned. Could it be that they were discovered by the Wangs? The exploration of some magical dimensional zone was used as a ruse to eliminate them?” After some thought, the blonde middle-aged man realized that there was only one possibility.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, we have underestimated the Wangs. Since that dimensional zone is fake, this matter ends here. You are dismissed.” The Cape family head lowered his head and continued studying the item in his hand. The Wangs weren’t worth his anger.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Wang family was a family in the East District after all. It would be very troublesome for the Cape family to touch them.</p>
<p>More and more alien races appeared on the Cube’s rankings, but no humans entered the ranking. Although there were also humans who attempted to enter the rankings, they couldn’t even cross the Lake of Fog, much less pluck the golden apple.</p>
<p>“I’m really displeased seeing those alien races act so arrogantly.” Li Xuan was feeling depressed watching the livestream. When he saw Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu walk over, his eyes lit up. He walked over with a smile and wrapped his arm around their shoulders. “Aren’t we good brothers?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1749'>Chapter 1749 Godfiend Spacetime</h3>
<p>“No.” Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan took a step back almost at the same time and looked at Li Xuan warily.</p>
<p>Li Xuan retracted his hands in embarrassment before his expression instantly changed. He said indignantly, “I never expected you guys to be such people. I treated you as brothers, but you don’t treat me as a brother. Are you still human? Do you have any conscience?”</p>
<p>“You’re not a bad person when you don’t call us brother. But nothing good comes out of you calling us brother,” Ming Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Am I that kind of person?” Li Xuan said angrily.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan answered in unison.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was taken aback as he scratched his nose in embarrassment. “Your misunderstanding of me is too deep…”</p>
<p>“Just get straight to the point. We know what kind of person you are,” Ming Xiu said.</p>
<p>“I’m just thinking that there’s not a single human on the Cube. It doesn’t look pretty. There aren’t many golden apples left. Why don’t you go up and win some glory for us humans?” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“I want to, but this isn’t easy,” Ming Xiu said helplessly.</p>
<p>“What’s not easy about it?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“Firstly, we might not be able to pluck the golden apple since our strength is still lacking. Secondly, the various alien races have sent similar messages to their representatives. We are not allowed to challenge this dimensional zone,” Ming Xiu said.</p>
<p>“You are representatives, not slaves. Must you obey them? I think they just don’t want the dimension’s resources to fall into the hands of us humans. They are extremely sinister,” Li Xuan goaded.</p>
<p>“Of course, other than the contract’s conditions, there aren’t many restrictions on a representative. It’s not impossible to go if we have to, but we can forget about receiving any more resources.” Ming Xiu shrugged.</p>
<p>“There will still be more resources?” Li Xuan was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>“Of course, they agreed to help us advance to the Heaven level. Otherwise, how can we have any competitive ability?” Ming Xiu thought for a moment and continued, “However, that’s not the main point. I’ve gained a lot of insight recently. Even if I don’t receive their resources, advancing to the Heaven level is only a matter of time. The main reason is that we haven’t reached the Heaven level yet. We might not be able to pass through the Lake of Fog to pluck the golden apple.”</p>
<p>“Is that Lake of Fog really that terrifying? Those alien races seemed quite relaxed.” Li Xuan found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>“It’s not that simple.” It was rare for the taciturn Feng Qiuyan to speak. “The alien races have a better understanding of that place to begin with. The alien races that attempt it have a way to restrain the place, but our understanding of the Lake of Fog is very limited. From the looks of it, the fog should have the ability to disrupt space. The lake water also has some kind of suction force that will suck a Calamity-grade creature to the bottom of the lake. Even if one can resist the suction force of the lake, as time goes by, one will eventually be exhausted. If we can’t crack the fog and reach the island in the middle of the lake before that, we will ultimately die.”</p>
<p>“Even you aren’t confident. From the looks of it, that place is indeed very dangerous. There’s no point in going,” Li Xuan said gloomily. “It’s just depressing watching those alien races strut around.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that simple? If Coach is willing to take action, that wouldn’t be a problem,” Feng Qiuyan said.</p>
<p>“Let’s go and find him.” Li Xuan could only let Zhou Wen do it. Therefore, he led Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu to find Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>With the help of the Zone Core, Godfiend Era advanced to the Calamity grade. Zhou Wen was studying the Godfiend Era’s Calamity Zone and Mystic Thearch’s powers.</p>
<p>Godfiend Era’s Calamity Zone was called Godfiend Spacetime. It had the characteristics of spacetime and was very useful. It was especially effective when combined with Mystic Thearch’s powers.</p>
<p>In Godfiend Spacetime, Zhou Wen could temporarily use Spacetime Backtracking.</p>
<p>For example, if Zhou Wen’s body was penetrated by a saber, as long as he used Godfiend Spacetime, his body could return to the state before he was hit.</p>
<p>Of course, this was only an example. In fact, it was much more complicated. Now, Godfiend Spacetime could only backtrack for a short period of time. He couldn’t randomly choose the period of the backtracking. He probably had to advance to Hell or the Heaven level to have greater freedom.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was mostly done studying Mystic Thearch’s abilities. This gave him a sliver of hope-hope to counterattack the dimension.</p>
<p>Mystic Thearch’s power could actually break through dimensional barriers. This was a power Zhou Wen had never seen before.</p>
<p>Typically, if one was in a dimensional zone, even if they had spatial teleportation abilities, it was impossible for them to teleport out of the dimensional zone. However, Mystic Thearch’s power could directly tear open the dimensional zone to connect to the space outside.</p>
<p>In other words, as long as Mystic Thearch attached herself to Zhou Wen in her soul form, Zhou Wen could ignore the dimensional zone’s seal. Once he encountered danger, he could directly teleport out of the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Coupled with the Godfiend Spacetime’s Spacetime Backtracking, Zhou Wen’s escape abilities were off the charts. He could head to any dimensional zone he hadn’t dared to go to without any worries.</p>
<p>Based on Zhou Wen’s testing of all the dimensional zones that he had downloaded, he could apparently teleport out.</p>
<p>Of course, this wasn’t what Zhou Wen valued the most. What excited him the most was that Mystic Thearch’s ability should be able to tear through the dimensional barrier, allowing Zhou Wen to enter the dimension freely.</p>
<p>This was only Zhou Wen’s speculation. He didn’t dare go to the dimension. If he encountered an Apocalypse-grade big shot, he might not have a chance of returning.</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>Now, he was using Godfiend Spacetime and Mystic Thearch’s abilities to explore Chess Mountain, hoping to advance the last Essence Energy Art to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, what are you busy with?” Li Xuan brought Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan to him.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen knew that something was up when he saw the three of them come together.</p>
<p>Li Xuan shared his thoughts with Zhou Wen before saying, “It’s a waste not to take things from the dimension. If you have the ability, show your face. That would bring us humans glory, right?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pondered for a moment and said, “It’s not difficult to pluck the golden apple, but I reckon the golden apple isn’t the most important thing in that dimensional zone.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? Doesn’t that place end after plucking the apple?” Li Xuan asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“That seems to be the case on the surface, but if it’s really that simple, why haven’t any of the alien race’s Apocalypse-grade experts appeared? I reckon there’s something hidden inside that we don’t know. Why don’t we let the alien races scout ahead and prevent those alien big shots from being on guard? At the final moment, we might have a chance of succeeding in one strike. Otherwise, if I’m watched by an Apocalypse-grade big shot, I’m afraid it will be difficult for me to have another chance.” Zhou Wen had already considered this problem, so it wasn’t that he didn’t dare go. “You sure are scheming.” Li Xuan said with a smile, “Then let them be smug for a few more days. However, not a single human has been on the rankings. It’s truly depressing.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1750'>Chapter 1750 Trajectory Girl</h3>
<p>“Do you want to go?” Zhou Wen pondered for a moment and asked Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>“Yes, Coach, do you have a solution?” Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>“Call Qin Zhen over. I’ll be your sparring partner.” Zhou Wen felt that it was time to showcase the true effects of the Teacher Domain.</p>
<p>“Right away.” Ming Xiu hurriedly ran out. He knew better than anyone how rare it was to be taught by Zhou Wen. It was comparable to an immortal opportunity.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, didn’t you say not to alert the enemy?” Li Xuan frowned.</p>
<p>“It might not be a bad thing to cause some commotion,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>Li Xuan seemed to understand something as he said in enlightenment, ‘You are trying to push them out as targets!”</p>
<p>“Don’t make it sound so nasty. I just want those alien races to know that humans aren’t as weak as they imagine, nor are they inseparable from their resources,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>“How boring. Another alien race.” A youth switched off the livestream on his phone with flagging interest. Over the past few days, there wasn’t a single human name on the Cube’s rankings. The number of people watching the livestream decreased.</p>
<p>“If Human Sovereign doesn’t come, I reckon no human can enter the rankings. Compared to the alien races, humans are still a little weak.” A youth beside him found it boring as well and switched his phone off.</p>
<p>Usph. 1 four Mali Pare</p>
<p>“I really hope Human Sovereign can come out quickly and steamroll those alien races,” the youth from before said.</p>
<p>“Are you guys dreaming?” A girl walked over arrogantly and said disdainfully, “Human Sovereign is only considered relatively strong among humans. He’s too ordinary when compared to the alien races. Steamroll others? It’s hard to say if he can cross the Lake of Fog.”</p>
<p>The girl’s words immediately made the surrounding people glare at her angrily.</p>
<p>“Young lady, what are you talking about?” the elder beside her glared at her.</p>
<p>“I’m just telling the truth. Humans are weak.” The girl didn’t take the angry looks of everyone to heart as though she hadn’t seen them.</p>
<p>“I think you’re asking for a beating.” A burly man rushed over angrily, wanting to teach the girl a lesson.</p>
<p>However, just as he reached out to grab the girl’s shoulder, a hand suddenly extended from the side and grabbed his wrist. Immediately, his entire body couldn’t move.</p>
<p>“Friend, a gentleman speaks without resorting to force.” The owner of the hand was a handsome man. With a shake of his hand, the burly man lost his balance and retreated. He ultimately failed to get a footing as he plopped to the ground.</p>
<p>The expressions of the onlookers changed. The burly man was rather famous in the area. After all, he was an expert who had successfully advanced to the Mythical stage using the Mythical Serum. Yet, he was easily pushed to the ground. It was obvious how terrifying the other man’s strength was.</p>
<p>Although they were angry, no one dared to say anything else as they watched the girl and the man leave one after another.</p>
<p>“Xiao, are humans such senseless creatures?” the girl said as she walked.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, most humans are delusional creatures,” Xiao said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Is that the same for Human Sovereign?” the girl asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Xiao answered with certainty.</p>
<p>The girl seemed somewhat disappointed. “Aren’t there any interesting humans?”</p>
<p>“According to what I know, there’s an interesting human, but this person is also a delusional person,” Xiao said.</p>
<p>“What’s the difference?” The girl couldn’t understand Xiao’s words.</p>
<p>“It sometimes becomes very interesting when one is excessively delusional,” Xiao explained.</p>
<p>The girl asked with piqued interest, “What’s interesting?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it interesting to turn delusion into reality?” Xiao said with a smile.</p>
<p>“That’s interesting, but is there really such a person?” The girl found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>“The city he’s in is nearby. Your Highness, do you want to pay a visit?” Xiao took out his phone and showed the girl a map.</p>
<p>“Then let’s go take a look and see if this delusional fanatic is as interesting as you say.” The girl glanced at the map on her phone before softly reciting, “Guide Ancient City…”</p>
<p>“He definitely won’t disappoint you, Your Highness.” Xiao’s eyes seemed to be smiling.</p>
<p>The two of them headed for Guide Ancient City. They didn’t seem to be walking fast, but they soon vanished.</p>
<p>Overseer Luoyang’s residence.</p>
<p>“Overseer, there’s news that the mermaid is out at sea,” An Sheng said excitedly to An Tianzuo when he arrived at the restaurant.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo didn’t react when he heard that. He placed the spoon to his mouth and gently blew at the porridge inside before taking it to Ya’er’s mouth. “Ya’er, be good. Have some porridge. You’re still growing. How can you not eat?”</p>
<p>“Uncle, I don’t want to eat it,” Ya’er said as she shook her head.</p>
<p>“Does it not suit your taste? What do you want to eat? I’ll make it for you myself. By the way, don’t you like the sweet soup I cook the most? I’ll cook it for you now,” An Tianzuo said dotingly as he put down the bowl and spoon.</p>
<p>“Uncle, I miss Brother,” Ya’er said pitifully as she looked at An Tianzuo with her large eyes.</p>
<p>over</p>
<p>An Tianzuo sighed softly. “Ya’er, be good. Wait a little longer. When the situation over there stabilizes, I’ll get Ah Sheng to take you to him.”</p>
<p>“Really, Uncle?” Ya’er immediately stood up happily.</p>
<p>“When has Uncle ever lied to you? Come, drink the porridge…” An Tianzuo picked up a spoonful of porridge and fed it to Ya’er.</p>
<p>After Ya’er finished the porridge, An Tianzuo got someone to take her to the garden to play before he and An Sheng went to the study.</p>
<p>“What did he say?” An Tianzuo asked with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>“The one from the Trajectory Holy Temple has been taken to Young Master Wen’s,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Who got him to take her there? Didn’t I get him to bring her here?” An Tianzuo frowned.</p>
<p>“He said that it’s more suitable over there.” An Sheng paused before saying, “I think it’s good to go to Young Master Wen. Young Master Wen’s people aren’t that inflexible. Perhaps they can do something we can’t.”</p>
<p>“Are you implying that I’m inflexible?” An Tianzuo glared at An Sheng.</p>
<p>“No, not at all. Overseer, you are mistaken. I’m saying that Young Master Wen’s people are rather barbaric. Perhaps they suit the taste of the person from the Trajectory Holy Temple,” An Sheng hurriedly explained.</p>
<p>“A bunch of amateurs.” An Tianzuo snorted coldly before continuing, “Make the arrangements. If anything happens on Xiao’s side, at least there’ll be a remedy.”</p>
<p>“Overseer, don’t worry. Didn’t he say that although the one from the Trajectory Holy Temple is strong, she’s not one of those old freaks. Her temperament hasn’t completely matured. Furthermore, she’s suppressed on Earth. Nothing serious will happen,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo stared at An Sheng without saying a word. An Sheng hurriedly said, “Overseer, don’t worry. I’ll do it right away.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1751'>Chapter 1751 The Best Teacher</h3>
<p>“There doesn’t seem to be anything special here.” The girl walked on the streets of Guide Ancient City as she looked around, seemingly disappointed.</p>
<p>How could anyone interesting be found in an ordinary place? The girl didn’t believe that there were any humans here that were worth her visit.</p>
<p>“Since we’re here, there’s no harm in taking a look,” Xiao said with a smile.</p>
<p>“I hope the person you mentioned won’t disappoint,” the girl said indifferently, no longer in high spirits.</p>
<p>“I think he will be interesting.” Xiao looked at the end of the long street.</p>
<p>The girl also looked over and saw a crowd. She didn’t know what they were doing.</p>
<p>The girl watched, but didn’t see anything amiss as she asked curiously, “What are they doing?”</p>
<p>“We’ll know when we go over,” Xiao said as he walked over.</p>
<p>The girl followed Xiao. When she arrived, she saw many people lining up in front of a hall.</p>
<p>“Friend, what are you doing?” Xiao stood at the back of the team and asked a man in front.</p>
<p>“Can’t you see for yourself…” the man grumbled, but before he could finish his sentence, he saw an Essence Energy Crystal in Xiao’s hand. Immediately, his fierceness turned mild as he took the Essence Energy Crystal with a smile. “The city guard is recruiting members. We are all here to register.”</p>
<p>“Being a city guard should be a very dangerous job, right? Why are there so many people signing up?” Xiao asked.</p>
<p>“You aren’t local, am I right?” the man asked in understanding.</p>
<p>“I’m new here,” Xiao answered.</p>
<p>“Then it’s no wonder. You aren’t aware that the City Guard’s captain, Captain Qin, is City Lord Zhou’s personal disciple. As long as one enters the City Guard, one can obtain Captain Qin’s guidance. You definitely know how powerful our City Lord Zhou is. He’s one of the strongest powerhouses among humans. He has killed countless dimensional creatures and even alien races are easily killed. How powerful is he? Captain Qin is his personal disciple, so her sword techniques are already godlike. We can obtain her guidance. If one is lucky, they might gain City Lord Zhou’s fancy; that would be amazing. That’s an opportunity that many people dream of. How can there not be many people registering?” the man said with a proud expression.</p>
<p>When the girl heard the words “even alien races are easily killed,” she couldn’t help but frown.</p>
<p>The man continued, “However, the City Guard’s recruitment requirements are very high. Ordinary people won’t be admitted. Don’t just look at how many people are lining up. It’s already not bad if one-tenth of them are admitted in the end. I’m just here to try my luck. If I can really enter the City Guard, it will be a blessing from my ancestors. After all, I’ll be City Lord Zhou’s grand-disciple. Perhaps I can storm into the dimension and kill those alien races. Let’s see if they dare to act arrogant.”</p>
<p>The man’s words were actually mostly what humans said when they bragged. He didn’t really believe that such a day would come.</p>
<p>However, these words sounded different to the girl’s ears. It made her expression turn ugly.</p>
<p>“How can we meet City Lord Zhou?” the girl asked the man.</p>
<p>“Just line up here. If you are accepted later, you will be able to see City Lord Zhou,” the man answered.</p>
<p>“Xiao, let’s line up as well,” the girl said coldly.</p>
<p>“Will that be okay? Don’t we have something to do?” Xiao said in a dilemma.</p>
<p>“There’s no rush. I want to see how powerful City Lord Zhou, who can easily kill alien races, is,” the girl said with a cold expression.</p>
<p>“Young lady, you’re right on that. Just follow our City Lord Zhou. The six families sound very powerful, but they are far inferior to our City Lord Zhou. If you are really lucky to enter the City Guard and obtain the City Lord’s favor, your future will be limitless. Killing the alien races will only be a matter of time…” The man was dancing on the precipice of death.</p>
<p>“Then I’m really looking forward to it,” the girl said expressionlessly. When she heard the man speak of luck, the corners of her eyes twitched.</p>
<p>The girl and Xiao were in the line. They waited for a while before entering the hall. The staff got them to fill in a form and do some tests.</p>
<p>The Strength and Speed tests were naturally nothing to the girl. She didn’t reveal too much either. All she wanted was to wait to see City Lord Zhou and see how he could easily kill the alien races.</p>
<p>Xiao didn’t say anything else. He only helped the girl fill in the information.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me the interesting person you mentioned is City Lord Zhou?” the girl asked Xiao.</p>
<p>“Yes, he’s quite an interesting person,” Xiao answered with a smile.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if it’s interesting, but you’re right about one thing. He’s indeed a seriously delusional person,” the girl said with a cold snort.</p>
<p>“That’s what makes it interesting, right?” Xiao said with a smile.</p>
<p>Just as the girl was about to say something, the staff who maintained order walked over and led the people who had passed the test to a square. They got everyone to line up and wait.</p>
<p>Soon, a few people walked over from the side tunnel and arrived at the podium in the square.</p>
<p>“The person in the middle is Zhou Wen,” Xiao said in a low voice as he stood behind the girl.</p>
<p>In fact, there was no need for Xiao to say which was Zhou Wen. This was because the youths who had signed up for the City Guard looked at Zhou Wen with admiration.</p>
<p>“Congratulations on passing the test. From today onwards, all of you will be members of Guide City’s guards. Let’s welcome our City Lord Zhou Wen to speak…” Before the staff member presiding over the ceremony could finish his sentence, applause sounded from below.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t look anything special,” the girl said disdainfully as she stared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>As the girl spoke, she suddenly saw Zhou Wen glance at her. It was unknown if it was intentional or not, but Zhou Wen’s gaze seemed to pause on the girl’s face before moving away.</p>
<p>Xiao didn’t respond. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly as he wore a faint smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood on the stage and swept his gaze across everyone’s faces before slowly saying, “I don’t know why you want to join the City Guard, nor do I want to know why you want to join it. I just want to know if you know what joining the City Guard means?”</p>
<p>“The best benefits, the most stable income.” A burly man’s words made everyone smile.</p>
<p>“You’re right. In Guide City, the City Guard’s income and benefits are the best. You can obtain large amounts of resources every month and receive the best training and the best guidance from a teacher…” As Zhou Wen spoke, he was suddenly interrupted by a voice.</p>
<p>“The best teacher? Are you referring to yourself?” It was the girl.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Zhou Wen. Although their motives were different from the girl’s, they also wanted to know if Zhou Wen was personally guiding them. Although Qin Zhen was very strong, she was naturally much weaker than Zhou Wen. It would be great if they could obtain Zhou Wen’s personal guidance.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the girl and sized up her cold face. He said calmly, “Yes.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1752'>Chapter 1752 Bet</h3>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s answer, the girl said with a faint smile, “Since you are the best teacher, you must be the strongest existence. Then, why haven’t I seen your name on the Cube’s rankings?”</p>
<p>With that said, everyone looked at her. They knew that she had come with ill intentions. Li Xuan, who was beside Zhou Wen, frowned and wanted to say something, but he was stopped by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Young lady, you are still young and lacking in culture and knowledge. I don’t blame you for that,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen secretly implying that she was illiterate, the girl nearly blew her top. She glared at Zhou Wen and said, “What did I say wrong? Please point it out.”</p>
<p>“The most outstanding artist in the world, the best chess player, and the strongest warrior. I believe many people are familiar with their names, but how many people know who their teacher is? How many people know what great achievements and works their teacher has?” Zhou Wen continued unhurriedly, “There are specialties in every field. A good teacher doesn’t necessarily have to be powerful. It depends on what kind of student the teacher produces.”</p>
<p>“In that case, the students you taught are very powerful. I wonder which one on the Cube’s ranking is your student? Which Immortal? Or is it a Saint?” The girl’s tone was filled with mockery as she continued, “There’s no human on the rankings. I wonder which alien is your student?”</p>
<p>The people beside her glared at the girl. Everyone knew that she was deliberately causing trouble.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t angry. He continued smiling as he looked at the girl and said, “Since you think so, why don’t we make a bet?”</p>
<p>“How?” the girl asked.</p>
<p>“If my disciple’s name is on the Cube’s rankings, you have to sincerely acknowledge me as your master and bow in front of everyone. Do you dare take the bet?” Zhou Wen asked the girl.</p>
<p>“Sure, but if you lose, I don’t want you to just acknowledge me as your master. I want you to kneel before me in public and acknowledge me as your master.” When the girl said that, everyone was enraged.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s reputation in the city was extremely high. Ignoring Li Xuan and company, even the reserve members of the City Guard who had just passed the test wished they could lunge forward and slap the girl twice.</p>
<p>The girl didn’t seem to notice their angry glares as she looked at Zhou Wen with contempt. She knew very well the origins of the alien races on the rankings. It was impossible for Zhou Wen’s students to be on the list.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Zhou Wen waved his hand to stop the commotion and gave the girl an affirmative answer.</p>
<p>The girl was somewhat surprised as she curled her lips and said, “Then please point out who your student is. Don’t try to bluff your way out by randomly pointing out one. That’s useless to me. I have plenty of ways to verify it.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to prove it.” Zhou Wen pointed at Ming Xiu and said to the girl, “Do you think he’s considered my student?”</p>
<p>“So what if he’s your student?” The girl frowned.</p>
<p>“Then let’s have his name appear on the rankings,” Zhou Wen said calmly.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, Ming Xiu didn’t wait for him to say anything else. He got up and walked out. In a few steps, he had already left the square and was heading for the Cube in the city.</p>
<p>The girl immediately understood what Zhou Wen was up to. She couldn’t help but sneer. “What a good plan. I’m just afraid that your student will die for nothing.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only smiled and didn’t say anything else. He led everyone towards the Cube as the girl and Xiao followed.</p>
<p>Ever since the dimensional zone in the dimension had opened up, no human had passed through the Lake of Fog to reach the golden apple tree. Having the golden apple being plucked by the alien races left many humans depressed.</p>
<p>“Why hasn’t anyone stepped forward to clear the level at this point in time? Where did those human gods of war who usually claim to be invincible go? Could it be that even Human Sovereign has cowered? Is the dimension really that terrifying?” A young man watched the live broadcast as he sent comments to vent his displeasure.</p>
<p>Su Yi, who was hosting the program, saw many similar comments. She said with a heavy voice, “Professor Gu, there aren’t many golden apples left. Do you think humanity still stands a chance of plucking a golden</p>
<p>apple?”</p>
<p>OUS</p>
<p>Professor Gu pondered for a moment before saying, “Previously, there were a few famous human powerhouses who attempted it, but they failed to even pass through the Lake of Fog. It’s obvious how terrifying the dimensional zone is. They far exceed the dimensional zones in Earth’s universe. With humanity’s overall strength, I’m afraid only a few of the strongest powerhouses have the possibility of clearing the level to pluck the golden apple. However, such an existence is our most precious wealth. How can we easily take the risk? Not participating is the best choice.”</p>
<p>“Could it be that Human Sovereign isn’t completely confident?” Su Yi asked again.</p>
<p>“Impulsiveness is the devil. Regardless of whether one has the confidence or not, there’s no need to take risks. By staying useful, one can do more meaningful and valuable things in the future. I personally think that the choice between Human Sovereign and all the human powerhouses is correct. This is the correct choice…” As Professor Gu spoke, he suddenly saw the Cube light up.</p>
<p>“Someone’s attempting the level… It’s a human…”</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, who is it? I don’t think I’ve seen him before!”</p>
<p>“I seem to remember him. He’s called Swordsman Today or something…”</p>
<p>“Fool, it’s Swordsman Tomorrow. He’s quite famous in our area, but he should be much weaker than top experts like Mohe. Why is he there?”</p>
<p>“Swordsman Tomorrow? Isn’t that Ming Xiu from the Ming family? I heard that he has pledged allegiance to an underling of the An family. An Tianzuo didn’t do it himself, and instead sent him there? Isn’t this sending him to his death?”</p>
<p>Everyone discussed spiritedly. Many people recognized Ming Xiu, but most people didn’t know that he had joined Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Under the attention of everyone, Ming Xiu entered the Lake of Fog and floated above the lake. His surroundings were filled with fog; there was zero visibility.</p>
<p>“Swordsman Tomorrow’s Tomorrow Sword Art is rather famous, but can his Tomorrow Sword Art nullify the strange fog?” Su Yi stared at the Cube’s screen and commented.</p>
<p>“The fog should be a kind of nomological power. It can’t be broken by physical attacks. It’s useless no matter how good your sword techniques are…” As Professor Gu spoke, he saw Ming Xiu draw a sword.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu looked straight ahead and drew his sword to stab forward. The sword’s body slowly stabbed forward, and his body moved with the sword. He became one with the sword and charged forward.</p>
<p>His strike didn’t have a shocking aura, nor was there any resplendent sword beam. Instead, it was like a beautiful swordswoman flying on a sword, performing some kind of artistic sword dance.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1753'>Chapter 1753 Humanity’s First Fruit</h3>
<p>“He didn’t plunge in? How did he do it?” Su Yi was overjoyed as she said excitedly.</p>
<p>The comments exploded. Everyone was discussing why Ming Xiu hadn’t fallen into the lake. Previously, there were human powerhouses who had attempted to clear the level, but just as they entered the Lake of Fog, they inexplicably fell into the lake and died.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu could actually fly on the Lake of Fog. This was already a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>“This Ming Xiu fella is something! Why haven’t I heard of him before?”</p>
<p>“Ignorant. That’s a powerhouse from our East District, the famous Swordsman Tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“What’s there to be smug about? He’s not out of the Lake of Fog yet.”</p>
<p>Everyone discussed spiritedly. The names ‘Ming Xiu’ and ‘Swordsman Tomorrow’ quickly spread throughout the Federation. Even many factions in the dimension were paying attention to the attempt.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu rode his sword and slowly flew across the misty lake.</p>
<p>Suddenly, his stance changed. He slashed with his hand. His actions were still gentle and slow, but there was nothing wherever his sword slashed.</p>
<p>After that, Ming Xiu brandished his sword several times, but he failed to hit anything. Everyone was puzzled.</p>
<p>“What’s he doing? Performing?” Many people were puzzled. They really couldn’t see the meaning behind the sword brandishing. They only felt that it was a swordplay.</p>
<p>Professor Gu, who hadn’t commented in a long time, seemed to understand something. He said excitedly, “Amazing, really amazing!”</p>
<p>“Professor Gu, are you talking about Ming Xiu?” Su Yi asked Professor Gu in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Of course.” Professor Gu continued excitedly, “Swordsman Tomorrow lives up to his reputation. I have to take back what I said previously. His sword art has already transcended the typical sword art and reached an unprecedented height. It’s not an exaggeration to say that he’s the number one sword art expert I’ve ever met.”</p>
<p>“Professor Gu, can you please explain in detail how strong Swordsman Tomorrow’s sword technique is?” Su Yi added.</p>
<p>“Previously, many human experts speculated about the Lake of Fog. Most of them believed that the Lake of Fog had a powerful suction force. Creatures with insufficient strength would be sucked to the bottom of the lake the moment they entered. However, after seeing Swordsman Tomorrow’s performance, I truly understand that my previous guess was wrong. The Lake of Fog doesn’t have any suction force. What really pulls creatures to the bottom of the lake isn’t the suction force of the lake, but an invisible creature,” Professor Gu said seriously.</p>
<p>“An invisible creature?” Su Yi looked at the lake in surprise again, but she still didn’t discover anything. She said in puzzlement, “If there’s really a creature lurking in the lake to attack the challenger, even if it can’t be seen with the naked eye, the lake should have some reaction, right? But from the looks of it, the lake doesn’t stir at all. It’s as calm as a mirror’s surface. How does that creature rush out of the water to attack the challenger?”</p>
<p>“It’s precisely because the lake doesn’t stir that I was misled. Only when Swordsman Tomorrow appeared did I discover something. That underwater creature is an existence that can freely traverse the water without affecting the water flow. However, you have to watch carefully. Don’t look at the water surface. Pay attention to the fog around Swordsman Tomorrow when he brandishes his sword… It’s not beside the sword, but somewhere further away from it…”</p>
<p>After hearing Professor Gu’s words, people looked carefully and immediately saw something unusual.</p>
<p>Every time Ming Xiu brandished his sword, a tiny vortex would appear in the fog not far from the sword. If one didn’t look carefully, they would think that it was the airflow caused by the sword.</p>
<p>However, upon careful inspection, one would discover that the direction of the vortexes was clearly different from the airflow triggered by the sword.</p>
<p>The more Professor Gu spoke, the more excited he became. “Although I can’t see what that creature is, every swing of Swordsman Tomorrow’s sword forces it into a retreat. Clearly, it has sealed off the creature’s attack path. It looks like he’s slowly brandishing his sword, but it’s an ingenious and flawless judgment and seal… This person is really too powerful… I can’t imagine how he did it…” After Professor Gu’s explanation, the average person gradually understood. The more they looked at Ming Xiu, the more they felt that he was indeed extremely powerful. Their impression of him gradually improved.</p>
<p>“I never expected such a powerful swordsman to exist among us humans!”</p>
<p>“This Swordsman Tomorrow is really strong and ferocious. He’s many times stronger than the representatives of the six families. Look at those fellows. They don’t even dare to attempt the level while he rushes straight in.”</p>
<p>“From today… No… From now on… Ming Xiu is my idol…”</p>
<p>Everyone watched as Ming Xiu tore through the fog like a sword immortal. In the distance, they could vaguely see the lake’s bank and the golden apple tree. They immediately became excited.</p>
<p>“These young people grow very quickly.” Zhang Chunqiu looked at the scene on the Cube and couldn’t help but sigh.</p>
<p>“You make it sound like you’re very old. You’re not much older than them,” Xia Liuchuan said with a twitch of his lips.</p>
<p>“My person may not be old, but my heart is old,” Zhang Chunqiu said indifferently.</p>
<p>“There are merits to being old. This world doesn’t just need young courage,” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>“But that’s the mental crutch that humans need,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>It was indeed as Zhang Chunqiu had said. The moment Ming Xiu stepped onto solid ground, many people watching the livestream around the world cheered in unison.</p>
<p>Although many people didn’t know who Ming Xiu was in the past, at that moment, Ming Xiu was like family or even their own incarnation. They felt the joy as if it was their own.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu held his sword and walked towards the golden apple tree. Under the attention of everyone, he slashed at the stalk of one of the golden apples.</p>
<p>Just as everyone thought that humans were finally about to take down the first golden apple, they heard a metallic clang. The thin stalk blocked Ming Xiu’s sword without suffering any damage.</p>
<p>Everyone was alarmed. Previously, when they saw the alien races easily pluck the golden apples, they imagined that it would be easy to pluck it. They never expected it to be so hard.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu slashed at the apple stalk again and again. After slashing more than ten times, he failed to damage it at all. His forehead was already covered in sweat, and his breathing had become very heavy. Everyone was alarmed.</p>
<p>Is the difference between humans and alien races really that great? Many humans couldn’t help but feel a chill.</p>
<p>“Humans are ultimately too weak. So what if they can walk to the golden tree? They can’t do anything.” The girl, who was originally worried, secretly heaved a sigh of relief when she saw this scene. She looked at Zhou Wen provocatively.</p>
<p>Just as the girl said that, Ming Xiu took two steps back and didn’t continue brandishing his sword. He only held his sword in one hand and stared intently at the golden apple hanging on the tree branch.</p>
<p>In the next second, Ming Xiu suddenly brandished his sword again. However, this time, his sword was even slower than before. It moved towards the golden apple inch by inch.</p>
<p>“Can such a slow sword slice off the golden apple?” Su Yi asked. This was also the answer all humans wanted to know.</p>
<p>The moment the blade touched the branch, it made one feel as though their eyes had gone adrift. For some reason, the sword passed through the tree branch and arrived behind the golden apple.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Just as everyone was wondering what had happened, the tree branch snapped and the golden apple fell. Ming Xiu grabbed it with one hand.</p>
<p>Humanity finally had their first golden apple.</p>
<p>Soon, the Cube’s screen changed. The dimensional zone vanished and was replaced by the Cube’s ranking. A new name appeared on the rankings. However, when people saw the name clearly, their eyes widened as their mouths involuntarily gaped. They didn’t close them for a long time.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1754'>Chapter 1754 The Weakest Disciple</h3>
<p>“Zhou’s Weakest Disciple, Ming Xiu! What the hell is this?”</p>
<p>“Zhou? Which Zhou? Isn’t his surname Ming?”</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, could it be Zhou Wen?”.</p>
<p>“That’s a little ridiculous. Zhou Wen might not even be able to reach such a level.” “Is this a prank? From the looks of it, Swordsman Tomorrow has a good relationship with Zhou Wen.”</p>
<p>“This joke is too much… Zhou’s disciple… and the weakest at that…”</p>
<p>When they saw Ming Xiu’s name on the rankings, there was an uproar. It was totally unacceptable. The first human to pluck the golden apple was actually a young man’s disciple. It was fine if he was a disciple, but to claim that he was the weakest—no matter how one looked at it, he appeared to be deliberately posturing.</p>
<p>“Coach, I’m ranked ninth. Is that alright?” Ming Xiu walked out with a grin.</p>
<p>“It’s alright.” Zhou Wen never expected Ming Xiu to leave such a name on the rankings. However, it didn’t matter. He looked at the girl and said, “How about it? Is my disciple’s name on the rankings now?”</p>
<p>The girl’s expression turned nasty as she gritted her teeth and said, “He’s clearly the representative of the Inter race. He used the power of the Inter race. How is that because you’re his teacher?”</p>
<p>“Why? Have you swallowed your previous words?” Li Xuan mocked. The girl’s lips moved as though she wanted to say something, but she couldn’t.</p>
<p>“Not convinced?” Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush as he asked the girl with a smile.</p>
<p>“Of course not. He’s clearly the representative of the Inter race. How can he be considered a student of yours?” The girl was naturally indignant.</p>
<p>“Alright, since you aren’t convinced, I’ll make sure you are convinced.” Zhou Wen could sense that although the girl looked ordinary, she had an extremely terrifying aura. He didn’t wish to force her, so he gave Feng Qiuyan a look.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan wasn’t a person who liked to waste his breath. When he saw Zhou Wen’s look, he walked straight to the Cube and started the challenge.</p>
<p>“This is also my student. If he leaves his name on the rankings, will you submit?” Zhou Wen asked with a smile. “Hmph, leave a name before we speak.” The girl was very stubborn, but she was already feeling a little nervous.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen smiled and didn’t say anything else. He turned to look at the Cube’s screen.</p>
<p>Everyone was still immersed in the excitement of having the first human pluck the golden apple. Many people were discussing what Ming Xiu’s Zhou’s Weakest Disciple meant.</p>
<p>Most people who knew guessed that Ming Xiu was referring to Zhou Wen, but how could the average person know? There were many ordinary people in the East District who knew that Ming Xiu had joined Guide City. The ordinary people in the other districts had never even heard of Ming Xiu’s name, so how could they know where he was?</p>
<p>Many people were asking who Zhou referred to. Those who knew Zhou Wen’s name immediately posted Zhou Wen’s name on the Internet as well as his relationship with Ming Xiu.</p>
<p>“For real? From what you’re saying, Zhou Wen is only about Ming Xiu’s age. How can he be Ming Xiu’s teacher? Are you joking?”</p>
<p>“He must be joking. No matter how powerful Zhou Wen is, it’s impossible for him to be stronger than Ming Xiu, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Ming Xiu is already a top existence among humans. How old is Zhou Wen? How can he be Ming Xiu’s teacher!?”</p>
<p>As everyone discussed, they suddenly saw the Cube’s screen light up again.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, another human is attempting the level. What day is it today? Nobody tried previously, but when it rains, it pours!”</p>
<p>“Who is that person? He also looks unfamiliar!”</p>
<p>“I don’t know him. He’s less famous than Swordsman Tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me he thinks that Ming Xiu did it easily, so he thinks that the dimensional zone is easy and wants to try his luck?”</p>
<p>It was no wonder they didn’t know Feng Qiuyan. Feng Qiuyan was much more low-key than Ming Xiu. Many people in the East District knew the name of Swordsman Tomorrow. Few people in the East District knew Feng Qiuyan’s name, much less the other districts. “Professor Gu, do you know this Feng Qiuyan?” As expected of a host, Su Yi was quite knowledgeable. She immediately called out Feng Qiuyan’s name. However, she had only seen some information about him and knew that there was such a person. She didn’t know much about Feng Qiuyan’s strength.</p>
<p>“If I remember correctly, this Feng Qiuyan should be from the South Sea’s Feng family. Now that the South Sea has fallen, there aren’t any humans living there. I wonder where the Feng family has moved to.” Professor Gu was rather professional as he directly revealed Feng Qiuyan’s origins.</p>
<p>“Do you think Feng Qiuyan has a chance of plucking the golden apple?” Su Yi asked again.</p>
<p>“There’s definitely a chance, but it’s very small. Although Swordsman Tomorrow has already scouted the Fog Lake and it’s theoretically much easier for people to clear it later, Feng Qiuyan is too anxious. If he spent more time on preparation, the chances would be much higher. He’s too rash… However, there aren’t many golden apples left now. It’s understandable that he’s anxious…” Professor Gu meant that Feng Qiuyan was too eager for success and wanted to take the opportunity to pick up the spoils.</p>
<p>However, just as Professor Gu said that, he saw Feng Qiuyan appear above the Lake of Fog. Then, without doing anything else, he drew his saber and slashed forward.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The saber beam slashed down like the blade of heavenly punishment, splitting the fog in front of him into two. The fog churned to the sides, revealing a straight and wide path.</p>
<p>The saber beam didn’t stop as it slashed at the lake, splitting it into two. The waves surged to the sides as though they were separated by divine power as they extended into the distance.</p>
<p>At the end of the slash, one could see the divine tree with the golden apple. Feng Qiuyan’s body was like a stream of light as he instantly rushed to the island and landed in front of the divine tree.</p>
<p>He drew his saber and slashed again. He chopped off a golden apple which landed in his hand.</p>
<p>All of this happened too quickly. Everyone was still waiting to see how Feng Qiuyan would clear the level. Feng Qiuyan’s attempt ended before they were mentally prepared.</p>
<p>Only when the Cube’s screen jumped from the dimensional zone to the Cube’s rankings did people snap to their senses and break into an uproar. “F*ck, what did I just see?”</p>
<p>“Heavens, slap me. Was I dreaming?” “I’m probably still f*cking asleep, right? That’s it?”</p>
<p>“Where did this person come from? He’s too</p>
<p>powerful!”</p>
<p>“When did such a sicko appear among us humans?”</p>
<p>“Who said that we humans don’t have powerhouses? This Feng Qiuyan isn’t inferior to any dimensional creature…”</p>
<p>The comments were crazy. The screen was filled with question marks. No one could believe that such an unknown young man had cleared the level in such a domineering manner.</p>
<p>However, when they saw the name Feng Qiuyan left on the rankings, they weren’t just going crazy. They practically became berserk.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1755'>Chapter 1755 Zhou’s Disciples</h3>
<p>On the rankings, there were only a few simple words—”Zhou’s Disciple, Feng Qiuyan.” It wasn’t as fancy as Ming Xiu’s. It was just like Feng Qiuyan’s character-simple and direct.</p>
<p>However, these few simple words made everyone go crazy. If Ming Xiu was only joking previously, to have another person use the title of Zhou’s disciple made the seemingly joke title become intriguing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if Feng Qiuyan wasn’t Zhou Wen’s student, he was definitely under Zhou Wen like Ming Xiu. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have given such a name.</p>
<p>For two experts to suddenly appear on the rankings of a previously unknown human faction was terrifying enough.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there were only two humans on this ranking so far. It could be said that they stood above the entire Federation.</p>
<p>“Another of Zhou’s disciples. Is this for real?”</p>
<p>“Is Zhou Wen really very strong?”</p>
<p>“Could they really be Zhou Wen’s students?”</p>
<p>“It must be fake. How can such a thing happen? To have two Calamity-grade students who can enter the Cube’s rankings, it can only happen if Zhou Wen is an immortal!”</p>
<p>“Professor Gu, what’s your take? Could Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan really be Zhou Wen’s students?” Su Yi said excitedly.</p>
<p>“That… It’s hard to say… However, typically speaking, no one will joke on such matters. However, to say that someone about their age can teach two students like them is a little too odd…” Professor Gu said ambiguously. He didn’t dare to make any certain claims.</p>
<p>Previously, when Ming Xiu gave this name, almost no one believed it. They thought it was a joke, but now, everyone was doubtful. They weren’t so sure if it was a joke, but they couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>“I was wondering how powerful you were. So it’s another alien representative. He’s clearly the representative of the Phaseless race. What’s the difference between him and that Inter representative from before?” In any case, having said something similar, the girl clearly felt less burdened when she said such words. She spoke with a righteous tone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t mind. In fact, Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu could really be considered his disciples.</p>
<p>If it was in the past, because Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu had excellent talent and relied on themselves to figure things out, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have dared to admit that he had taught them. Now, Zhou Wen could say with a clear conscience that he had indeed taught them.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen hadn’t used the Teacher Domain to raise their realms and deduce their flaws, how could they have advanced to the Heaven level so quickly?</p>
<p>In fact, even without the matter regarding the girl, Zhou Wen had spent so much time and effort teaching them so that they could pluck the golden apple. A bet with the girl was just an additional boon to him.</p>
<p>Of course, the Teacher Domain was amazing, but it also depended on Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu’s aptitudes and perceptivity. Otherwise, it would be impossible for them to receive such a good effect. The Teacher Domain couldn’t teach a fool to be the strongest in the world. It could only be considered guiding and developing their potential.</p>
<p>“So this doesn’t count either? Then let’s have another one,” Zhou Wen said to the girl.</p>
<p>“Hmph, don’t tell me it’s another representative of some race?” The girl snorted coldly.</p>
<p>“Since you have such good eyesight, does she look like a representative of some race?” Zhou Wen pointed at Qin Zhen.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, the girl sized up Qin Zhen. A strange ripple flashed in her eyes, making her eyes appear like an abyss with layers of fog overlapping.</p>
<p>“She’s not a representative,” the girl said with certainty as she retracted her gaze.</p>
<p>“Then if she leaves her name on the rankings, you won’t go back on your word, right?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Who went back on their word? You were the one who cheated,” the girl immediately retorted.</p>
<p>“Just say it. If she enters the rankings, will you admit defeat or not?” Zhou Wen didn’t argue with her as he said indifferently.</p>
<p>Although the girl felt that Zhou Wen definitely had the confidence to say such words, she was irrevocably committed. All she could do was bite the bullet and say, “As long as she’s really your disciple, I’ll naturally admit defeat.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” Zhou Wen responded and turned to Qin Zhen. “Take it steady. Don’t fool around.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Qin Zhen replied. She turned around and walked towards the Cube to activate it again.</p>
<p>“Why? Are you so unconfident of a disciple you taught?” When the girl heard Zhou Wen’s exhortations to Qin Zhen, she imagined that Zhou Wen was worried that she wouldn’t be able to clear the level. She immediately felt emboldened and teased Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid that she will have too much fun,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>He wasn’t worried that Qin Zhen wouldn’t be able to clear the level. Previously, he had taught Feng Qiuyan, Ming Xiu, and Qin Zhen together. Ming Qiuyan and Ming Xiu had their own paths, and Zhou Wen had only played a supporting role.</p>
<p>However, Qin Zhen was different. The path she had taken was Zhou Wen’s to begin with. It could be said that Zhou Wen had guided Qin Zhen all the way.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was a man, but Qin Zhen was a woman. The Immortal Slaying that Zhou Wen had developed was domineering, and Qin Zhen had an especially stubborn personality.</p>
<p>She believed in Zhou Wen and the path he had pointed out, so she firmly took it without any detours or diversions.</p>
<p>However, women were fundamentally different from men. This wasn’t discrimination, but simply physical differences.</p>
<p>Qin Zhen was unbending. Furthermore, as a woman, she pushed the domineeringness to an even higher level.</p>
<p>This couldn’t be considered a mistake. Not being adaptable wasn’t a flaw. However, the outcome of doing so was to make Qin Zhen’s sword art extreme and domineering.</p>
<p>Clearing the level wasn’t a problem, but being excessively hard made things brittle. Zhou Wen was afraid that Qin Zhen would be too extreme and take risks, resulting in injury.</p>
<p>The reason he got Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan to challenge the level first was to give Qin Zhen time to prepare to prevent her from injuring herself by being too unyielding.</p>
<p>He was bound to win, but Zhou Wen wanted zero damage; he wasn’t worried about winning or losing</p>
<p>“What’s going on today? Another person is attempting the level again? And it’s a woman?” Su Yi couldn’t help but be surprised when she saw Qin Zhen appear on the screen.</p>
<p>Donned in white armor and a silver helm, Qin Zhen’s outstanding figure was accentuated by her long and slender legs. Even if one couldn’t see her face, her figure and aura made one feel that she was a beauty.</p>
<p>“Can someone tell me who this woman is?”</p>
<p>“She doesn’t even show her face. Who can tell? However, she shouldn’t be another of Zhou’s, right?”</p>
<p>“Who knows? What if it’s another of Zhou’s disciples?”</p>
<p>“That’s impossible. A single Guide City producing three ranked experts?”</p>
<p>“These legs… This figure… is really amazing…”</p>
<p>“After Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan, all sorts of people are appearing. I wonder which family she belongs to. There are quite a number of female representatives in the six families; I just wonder who she is.”</p>
<p>“Why doesn’t she show her face? If she dies inside, no one will remember her? This figure… Tsk, tsk…”</p>
<p>Everyone discussed spiritedly as they guessed where Qin Zhen came from and if she could clear the level like Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1756'>Chapter 1756 Take it Steady. Don’t Fool Around</h3>
<p>Qin Zhen levitated over the Fog Lake. The only thing people could see on the Cube’s screen was her. There was endless fog around her.</p>
<p>Everyone stared nervously at the scene as they wondered if this woman with an excellent figure could tear through the fog’s obstruction, dodge the underwater monster’s attack, or how she would clear the level and pluck the golden apple.</p>
<p>Waiting-everyone was waiting, but as time passed, Qin Zhen floated there without moving as though the scene had frozen. “What’s going on? Is the livestream stuck?”</p>
<p>“The technology these days is getting worse. It can even lag for such a simple livestream.”</p>
<p>“We strongly condemn the incompetent officials of the Federation.”</p>
<p>“What are you braying? How is it lagging? Open your eyes and watch carefully. The fog is still moving.”</p>
<p>“It’s really moving. If it’s not lagging, why isn’t she moving?”</p>
<p>“Did her brain suddenly short-circuit?”</p>
<p>Everyone looked at the livestream in puzzlement, wondering what the woman was waiting for.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw Qin Zhen standing there motionless, he couldn’t help but clasp his forehead with a depressed expression.</p>
<p>He naturally knew what Qin Zhen was thinking, but he had clearly exhorted her to take it steady and not fool around. Now, she was standing there, waiting for the invisible monster in the lake to come out. She wanted to kill the water monster. Was there anything else that was f*cking crazier?</p>
<p>Finally, Qin Zhen moved. She condensed light into a sword and slashed at the calm lake.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Although one couldn’t see what Qin Zhen’s sword beam had hit, the cracking sound made it obvious that she had definitely slashed at something and severed it.</p>
<p>The purple light condensed into a sword in Qin Zhen’s hand. After the strike, the sword beams crisscrossed and slashed at the lake.</p>
<p>Cracks sounded incessantly like steel being sliced apart. Qin Zhen was like a high and mighty queen as she mercilessly lashed at the ants beneath her.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, this woman is too ferocious. She actually wants to kill the invisible monster in the lake! She’s not leaving unless it’s killed!”</p>
<p>“Awesome, really awesome. She’s really heretical. She doesn’t care about clearing the level at all. She’s here to kill monsters to gain experience.”</p>
<p>“This woman is really… inexplicable…”</p>
<p>“There’s indeed no explanation. This figure and sword technique are too domineering.” “I wonder what she looks like.”</p>
<p>The nervousness from before instantly vanished without a trace. Now, no one was worried about Qin Zhen clearing the level. The atmosphere became extremely festive.</p>
<p>People were guessing if the woman could kill the invisible monster in the lake. Some even made bets.</p>
<p>Qin Zhen didn’t make them wait too long. After the continuous cracking sounds, Qin Zhen suddenly became one with the sword. She transformed into an extremely domineering purple sword beam and instantly rushed into the lake.</p>
<p>This series of actions stunned everyone. Everyone was thinking about how to clear the level, but this woman refused to leave unless she killed the monster. She had actually rushed into the lake herself. Any other person who did that would be an expert at courting death.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A pillar-like purple sword beam erupted from the lake and shot into the sky. Something seemed to shatter amidst the sword beam, producing the loud sound of glass shattering.</p>
<p>With a loud bang, the heavy fog that enveloped the Lake of Fog dissipated, revealing a clean mirror-like lake and the strange golden fruit tree in the distance.</p>
<p>There was also Qin Zhen, who appeared in the sky with the sword beam, looking down at the golden fruit tree like a lofty queen.</p>
<p>“This woman is really too arrogant and fierce. Who would dare marry her!?”</p>
<p>“She has the right to be arrogant. If you have the ability, go kill the monster on the Cube.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, please accept my bow and take me in. I’m willing to die for you…”</p>
<p>“I knew it. There are many experts among humans. Previously, no one was willing to step forward. Now, there are so many…”</p>
<p>Amidst everyone’s discussion, Qin Zhen walked towards the golden fruit tree. The distance to the lake wasn’t as far as she imagined. The reason there was a sense of distance was because of the fog.</p>
<p>Without any suspense, Qin Zhen slashed down the golden apple. Following that, the Cube stopped its broadcast and revealed the Cube’s ranking</p>
<p>Ming Xiu got ninth while Feng Qiuyan got seventh. As Qin Zhen had killed the lake monster, her ranking was higher than theirs, so she was ranked fourth.</p>
<p>The ranking wasn’t much of a problem. After all, it wasn’t first place. The subsequent rankings weren’t too different, but when people saw the name on the Cube’s ranking, they were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“Zhou’s Disciple, Qin Zhen! It’s Zhou again!”</p>
<p>“This is crazy! Zhou has gotten three people on the rankings in a row.”</p>
<p>“I suddenly recalled Ming Xiu’s title!” “Haha, it looks like I’m not the only one who thought of it. It’s true that he’s Zhou’s weakest disciple. It’s really the truth. Feng Qiuyan and Qin Zhen are indeed stronger than him. He’s undoubtedly the weakest.”</p>
<p>“That’s ridiculous. The weakest student is ranked ninth. Is this real life?”</p>
<p>“Ming Xiu is the weakest. I wonder how many disciples can fight as well as Ming Xiu. Don’t tell me they will pluck all the remaining golden apples today!”</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, it can’t be that explosive, right!?”</p>
<p>“I think it’s possible. The six families are cowardly turtles. Now, Zhou Wen’s disciple has stepped forward to help us humans win back our pride. This is a true hero of humanity.”</p>
<p>“I’m in love. Who knows how I can become Zhou Wen’s disciple? I’m willing to be the weakest under Zhou.”</p>
<p>The words ‘Zhou’s Disciple’ instantly became popular. Some people had already changed their online name to ‘Zhou’s So-and-So,’ while others had changed it to ‘Zhou’s Lackey.’</p>
<p>“Anything else to say? She’s not a representative, right?” Zhou Wen asked the girl with a smile.</p>
<p>“She’s not a representative, but how would I know if she was personally taught by you? Perhaps you begged her to pretend to be one of your disciples.” The girl remained stubborn. If the dignified Holy Lady of the Trajectory Holy Temple were to acknowledge a human as her master, she would be disgraced.</p>
<p>“Since you say so, let’s end the bet,” Zhou Wen said casually. He didn’t really want the girl to bow to him as her master, nor did he plan on forcing her into a corner.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had long recognized the disguised Xiao. He could roughly guess the girl’s origins.</p>
<p>The girl was pumped when she heard Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>With the girl’s logic, if victory was already in her grasp, how could she let it go so easily?</p>
<p>For Zhou Wen to actually let it go, he was definitely afraid. The person named Qin Zhen was definitely not his disciple. Zhou Wen was a liar.</p>
<p>“Don’t. I’ve always kept my word. I’ll definitely keep my word. As long as you can prove that she was taught by you, I’ll immediately serve tea and acknowledge you as my master,” the girl said arrogantly, believing that she had caught Zhou Wen by surprise.</p>
<p>“How do you want me to prove it?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Simple. Since she’s your student, her sword art must have been taught by you. Show me her sword art. If a teacher’s sword art isn’t as good as a student’s, then our bet…” The girl didn’t finish her sentence, but her meaning was obvious. If Zhou Wen’s sword art was inferior to Qin Zhen’s, the bet would be considered her win.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1757'>Chapter 1757 The Elegance of that Strike</h3>
<p>“Are you sure you want to see my sword art?” Zhou Wen looked at the girl and asked helplessly.</p>
<p>“Of course, how can I go back on my word? If you want to bet, let’s bet to the end.” The more Zhou Wen was unwilling to force the girl into a corner, the more pumped she became. She only believed that she had grasped Zhou Wen’s weakness.</p>
<p>“Alright, I hope you won’t regret it.” Zhou Wen couldn’t compromise any further, nor did he wish to.</p>
<p>“I definitely won’t regret it,” the girl said</p>
<p>firmly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t waste any time. With a wave of his hand, an ordinary sword appeared in his hand.</p>
<p>“What can I do to make you think that my sword art is good enough?” Zhou Wen asked the girl.</p>
<p>“No, it’s not about being good enough. It has to be the same sword art as hers, and it has to be better than hers.” The girl corrected him and continued, “How about this? If you use all your strength to attack me, I can naturally tell if your sword art is better than hers.”</p>
<p>“That won’t do.” Zhou Wen shook his head.</p>
<p>“Why? Are you going back on your word?” the girl mocked.</p>
<p>“Of course not. I’m just afraid that you will go back on your word after losing and refuse to admit it,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I’m the dignified… How can I go back on my word? Am I that kind of person?” The girl was immediately enraged.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what kind of person you are. It’s true that someone went back on their word previously.” Zhou Wen looked at the girl as though he was saying: Don’t you know what kind of person you are? The girl wanted to refute, but when she thought of how she seemed to be in the wrong, the words she was about to say changed. “Then what do you want?”</p>
<p>“Blades and sabers have no eyes, so it’s inevitable that someone will be accidentally injured. There’s no need to draw the sword. How about this? Since you have to acknowledge me as your master after losing, I’ll teach you in advance. Use any sword art you want and I’ll correct your mistakes.” Zhou Wen threw the sword in his hand to the girl.</p>
<p>“You want to teach me how to use a sword?” The girl caught the sword and widened her eyes as she looked at Zhou Wen. The corners of her eyes twitched as though she had heard something unbelievable or an extremely funny joke.</p>
<p>“That’s right.” Zhou Wen nodded with certainty.</p>
<p>“Good, very good.” The girl laughed in exasperation as she cursed inwardly. How ignorant. What an arrogant and ignorant human. You actually dare to boast shamelessly about teaching me how to use a sword. I’m the dignified Holy Lady of the Trajectory Holy Temple. Can you understand my sword arts?</p>
<p>“Then watch carefully.” The girl was exasperated, but she didn’t argue. She drew the sword and slashed at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked by her actions because her strike was so fast. Furthermore, this strike was identical to the sword art Qin Zhen had used. There was almost no difference.</p>
<p>Even Li Xuan, Ming Xiu, and Feng Qiuyan’s expressions changed drastically.</p>
<p>She was able to replicate Qin Zhen’s sword art perfectly after watching for a brief moment. The movements weren’t only identical, but even her aura and sword intent were identical. This ability was inhuman.</p>
<p>Or rather, this girl had long been secretly plotting against Zhou Wen, allowing her to understand the sword art that Zhou Wen taught Qin Zhen so thoroughly.</p>
<p>Either way, this girl was up to no good.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised when he saw the girl’s abilities. Instead, he confirmed her identity. Previously, when he saw the girl and Xiao, Zhou Wen had roughly guessed that she was from the six Holy Temples. Now, he was basically certain that the girl was from the Trajectory Holy Temple like Xiao. With the help of the Teacher Domain, Zhou Wen saw it more clearly than the average person. It wasn’t identical, but carved from the same mold.</p>
<p>This wasn’t a result of training, but from replication. Only the Trajectory Holy Temple that studied Trajectory powers was good at this.</p>
<p>The sword in the girl’s hand slashed at Zhou Wen in an extremely domineering manner. The shimmering sword beams crisscrossed like lightning or cracks, enveloping Zhou Wen’s entire body. It left one shuddering.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen remained motionless. Even when the girl retracted her sword and retreated, he didn’t move his toes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid, but the people by the side were so nervous that their palms were sweating. If the girl’s sword tilted just a little, Zhou Wen’s head would be gone.</p>
<p>Thankfully, such a thing didn’t happen. Zhou Wen remained safe and sound.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you afraid that I’ll chop off your head?” Looking at the motionless Zhou Wen, the girl’s eyes were filled with surprise. She felt that this person was surprisingly bold.</p>
<p>“Why should I be afraid? Didn’t we agree? It’s just me giving pointers, not a duel. You won’t injure me, so what’s there to be afraid of?” Zhou Wen said calmly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally didn’t think so. He didn’t dodge because he was confident that the girl wouldn’t be able to injure him. He only wanted to use words to hold her back, hoping that she wouldn’t fall out with him if she lost.</p>
<p>The girl was still a little naive, so she never expected Zhou Wen to be so scheming. She thought to herself that although Zhou Wen wasn’t a good person, he was still a man of his word.</p>
<p>“You’ve finished seeing the sword art. Please correct me now,” the girl said with a faint smile as she threw the sword back to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>She had replicated Qin Zhen’s sword technique without missing a beat. She insisted on proving that Zhou Wen hadn’t taught it to Qin Zhen.</p>
<p>“At this level of sword arts, words no longer suffice. As your master, I’ll demonstrate it once to you. After seeing it, you will naturally know where your mistakes are.” Zhou Wen’s words infuriated the girl. It was as though she was bound to lose and had to acknowledge Zhou Wen as her master.</p>
<p>However, there was no time for the girl to retort. Zhou Wen slashed at her with the sword.</p>
<p>Domineering and resolute. If Qin Zhen’s domineeringness was like an empress in the human world, she had an irresistible, invincible authority, then Zhou Wen’s strike was unreasonable and domineering.</p>
<p>When immortals did a divination, they could figure out if a treasure was fated with them. All others were to give up.</p>
<p>When immortals did another divination, they could figure out if one’s time was out. The immortal could slay them on behalf of the heavens.</p>
<p>When an emperor needed someone executed, he had to at least throw charges at them with a groundless crime. Immortals didn’t need any reason. They were the heavenly mandate. If they said that one deserved death, one deserved death.</p>
<p>Ordinary people could only dream of such domineeringness, but they would never be able to achieve it.</p>
<p>Such domineeringness wasn’t Zhou Wen’s sword intent. His sword intent was even more extreme.</p>
<p>Immortal slaying-it didn’t matter if one were an immortal or a god. They could be finished off with one strike; there was no need to waste any breath on them.</p>
<p>This was the tyrant among tyrants. In short, it was “daddy” in “who’s your daddy.” If you were unreasonable, I would be even more unreasonable than you. There was no room for negotiation when beating you up.</p>
<p>The girl had originally made up her mind to remain motionless like Zhou Wen to show her poise. She was good at Trajectory powers, so she could determine his trajectory the moment he attacked. If Zhou Wen wanted to harm her, it wouldn’t be too late to dodge when the time came.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen slashed out, the girl was alarmed to discover that she couldn’t predict the trajectory of the strike. She couldn’t be sure if the final strike would hit her.</p>
<p>The girl’s face immediately revealed a look of panic. It was an unpredictable trajectory. This made the girl, who was used to having an omniscient view, panic.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s originally gentle image suddenly became as terrifying as a phantasm in her eyes. The domineering sword also seemed to become Death’s scythe that was about to reap her beautiful and touching life.</p>
<p>In her panic, the girl couldn’t help but take a step back.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1758'>Chapter 1758 Trajectory Seeking Kowtows for Tutelage</h3>
<p>Although it was only a small step, the girl’s beliefs were already shaken.</p>
<p>What was even more fatal was that after taking this small step back, the girl realized that the tip of Zhou Wen’s sword couldn’t touch her body. If she didn’t move, the tip of the sword would only slice past her.</p>
<p>This discovery further shattered the girl’s psychological defense. It instantly made her expression turn embarrassed and angry. It was anger and embarrassment after being fooled.</p>
<p>Just as she had expected, Zhou Wen’s strike slashed across her in a teasing manner. The further away the tip of the sword was from her, the uglier the girl’s expression.</p>
<p>Many of the new city guards watching the battle began booing.</p>
<p>The girl had slashed so many times beside Zhou Wen, but he stood there motionless. Many times, the blade had almost brushed past his cheek.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen had only slashed once and it was such a distance from the girl; yet, she had retreated. Clearly, she wasn’t confident enough.</p>
<p>“How’s my strike? Is it worthy of being able to teach such a student?” Zhou Wen sheathed the sword and said calmly to the girl.</p>
<p>The girl looked at Zhou Wen as her lips moved, but she couldn’t say a word. She could naturally tell that Zhou Wen’s realm and standards were far above Qin Zhen’s. Even she couldn’t figure out his trajectory. Such standards were probably something only the big shots of the various races could do in the dimension.</p>
<p>For a human to actually cultivate his sword arts to such a level, it could be said that he was infinitely close to the realm of the Apocalypse-grade big shots. He could probably even match the Apocalypse-grade realm. The girl couldn’t imagine how Zhou Wen had done it.</p>
<p>The girl knew very well that it was impossible for humans to produce an Apocalypse-grade. Finding someone close to one was impossible as well; yet, Zhou Wen’s sword art realm clearly exceeded his level.</p>
<p>In fact, the girl had overestimated Zhou Wen’s realm. Zhou Wen’s Immortal Slaying was indeed very strong and his realm was indeed very high.</p>
<p>When teaching Qin Zhen, the feedback from the Teacher Domain also deepened Zhou Wen’s understanding of Immortal Slaying. The teaching process was also a process of self-growth, allowing him to reach the present realm of Immortal Slaying.</p>
<p>Now, the Immortal Slaying realm was indeed close to the realm of many Apocalypse-grade big shots, but it was still quite a distance away. The reason the girl had such a feeling was thanks to the Teacher Domain.</p>
<p>When the girl demonstrated her sword art, the Teacher Domain had already produced some level of analysis. It was through such an analysis that Zhou Wen had a certain understanding of her Trajectory powers. Only by targeting her with the sword could he achieve a better effect.</p>
<p>The Heaven-level Teacher Domain was undoubtedly a divine skill.</p>
<p>The girl looked at Zhou Wen without the contempt from before.</p>
<p>The girl was already an existence infinitely close to the Apocalypse grade. She was also the existence closest to advancing to the Apocalypse grade in the Trajectory Holy Temple in the past few millennia. From her point of view, Zhou Wen was already qualified to be mentioned in the same breath as herat least in terms of sword arts realm.</p>
<p>“Lady, what are you waiting for? Quickly come and acknowledge him as your master. It’s your good fortune to be my brother’s disciple,” Li Xuan mocked.</p>
<p>“That’s right, young lady. Quickly acknowledge him as your master. It’s your good fortune to be under City Lord Zhou’s tutelage. If you miss this opportunity, there won’t be another one.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. To be able to become City Lord Zhou’s disciple is something many people can’t even beg for. You have profited from a disaster.”</p>
<p>Everyone jeered, causing the girl’s face to turn livid and pale. She looked like she would explode at any moment.</p>
<p>At that moment, Xiao stood forward and coughed lightly. “City Lord Zhou’s sword art is indeed unprecedented in the human world. This lady’s sword art isn’t inferior either. Why don’t we call this a draw?”</p>
<p>Xiao knew very well that if the girl really went berserk, even if Zhou Wen and company could remain safe and sound, Guide City would probably be reduced to a river of blood.</p>
<p>Just as Xiao said that, the girl suddenly looked up and stared at Zhou Wen with a sharp gaze. She enunciated each word clearly and said, “Will you dare have me acknowledge you as my master?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally didn’t take this to heart. Since he knew that the girl wasn’t human but an alien from the Trajectory Holy Temple, he wasn’t in the mood of taking in an alien student, much less teach her anything to prevent her from becoming a calamity for humanity in the future.</p>
<p>As Xiao spoke, Zhou Wen planned on letting it go, but with the girl provoking him, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to let her off.</p>
<p>“Why wouldn’t I dare?” Zhou Wen asked indifferently.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll acknowledge you as my master. I hope you won’t regret it in the future.” With that said, the girl really took a step forward and knelt in front of Zhou Wen. She said loudly, “Master, please receive three kowtows from your student, Trajectory Seeking.”</p>
<p>Xiao’s expression changed drastically, but it was too late to stop her.</p>
<p>Without a word, the girl knelt down. The moment her forehead touched the ground, the sky suddenly changed color. The originally bright sky instantly turned strange.</p>
<p>The sky seemed to turn into a kaleidoscope as it was split into pieces. The original clouds and sun seemed to become countless after being refracted by the kaleidoscope.</p>
<p>The sky was strange, beautiful, and resplendent. Instantly, everyone was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Looking up at the strange sky, Xiao’s expression turned abnormally odd.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also looking at the strange scene in the sky. The Teacher Domain wasn’t big enough to envelop the entire sky, so he naturally didn’t know what the strange scene was about.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen vaguely felt a strange energy fluctuation from the girl.</p>
<p>However, the power was extremely strange. It wasn’t metal, wood, water, fire, or earth, nor was it space, time, or matter. Instead, it was somewhat similar to the power on Wang Lu’s body, but it was also somewhat different.</p>
<p>“Do you dare let me continue?” The girl knelt in front of Zhou Wen with a teasing look in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you continuing? Aren’t you going to kowtow three times?” Zhou Wen said calmly.</p>
<p>“Master, please accept your student, Trajectory Seeking’s second bow.” The girl was straightforward as she bowed again.</p>
<p>With this bow, the originally kaleidoscope-like sky shattered like glass. After the kaleidoscope-like luster, it turned into an extremely dark abyss, going from a sharp contrast of extreme brightness to extreme darkness. The entire Guide City instantly fell into absolute darkness.</p>
<p>It was pitch-black, and it was difficult to make out anything that was inches away. The residents of Guide City fell into a panic. In fact, it wasn’t just Guide City. The entire world was in a panic, unsure what had happened.</p>
<p>“Master, please accept your disciple, Trajectory Seeking’s third kowtow.” Only the girl’s voice echoed in the darkness. Her figure couldn’t be seen, but one could hear her forehead touching the ground.</p>
<p>After this shout, a white light instantly descended from the extremely black sky. The white light was unimaginably fast as though it was originally there. From the moment it was discovered to the moment it landed on Zhou Wen, there seemed to be a period of time and space missing. It was impossible to dodge.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1759'>Chapter 1759 Nameless God</h3>
<p>In the palace that resembled the Primordial Universe, a terrifying existence suddenly opened its eyes. Its gaze seemed to be able to pass through distant stars.</p>
<p>What happened? Why was the Nameless God triggered? Could something have happened to Trajectory? The terrifying existence’s mind raced as strange ripples immediately appeared on its body. The ripples intertwined into a complicated net that trembled like countless ropes of fate.</p>
<p>Moments later, a strange expression appeared on the terrifying existence’s face. He had failed to deduce the fate trajectory related to Trajectory Seeking. However, he vaguely felt she wasn’t facing life-threatening danger.</p>
<p>“Holy Lord, what happened?” The creature guarding the terrifying existence was like a turtle or snake as it asked in surprise. “The Trajectory Holy Lady likely encountered something, but I can’t find the trajectory of her fate,” said Holy Lord Trajectory in thought.</p>
<p>“How is that possible? With your relationship with the Holy Lady, even if she’s on Earth and is screened by the rules, you should be able to see the trajectories of fate that are connected to her… Could it be that… the nomological forces on Earth have become stronger again?” the monster said in horror. “What should we do? If something happens to the Holy Lady, wouldn’t your plan…”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. If she’s really in danger, no matter how the rules of Earth screen it, I’ll still be able to sense her. The Holy Lady isn’t in danger now, but I can’t deduce her relevant trajectories…” Holy Lord Trajectory seemed to be thinking about something.</p>
<p>“Could it be that the other Holy Lords have discovered the secret of the Holy Lady and set up a trap to kill her? No, I have to personally rush to Earth. No matter what, I can’t let them succeed.” As the Turtle Snake spoke, it was about to crawl out of the cave beneath the divine throne. Resembling a turtle or snake, its head burned with black flames that were strange like a vortex.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to panic. The restrictions of Earth’s rules haven’t been completely removed. They don’t have the guts to go to Earth now. Even if they go, it will be difficult for them to unleash the power of the Apocalypse grade. How can they kill the Trajectory Seeking?” Holy Lord Trajectory said.</p>
<p>“That’s true. The Holy Lady has the combined power of six saints, making her an unparalleled perfect existence. In the future, once she advances to the Apocalypse grade, even the strongest Immortal Threach of the Immortals will probably find it difficult to match her. Those old fellows are nothing.” Only then did Turtle Snake recall what kind of existence the Holy Lady was. He was no longer in a rush to rush into Earth to save her.</p>
<p>“I’m just puzzled about what happened to trigger the Nameless God.” Holy Lord Trajectory still frowned as he thought, but no matter how he tried, he couldn’t obtain any more information related to it.</p>
<p>“The Nameless God was actually triggered. Doesn’t that mean that the Holy Lady is in grave danger? No, I have to make a trip personally. I can’t let anything happen to the Holy Lady.” Turtle Snake immediately became agitated.</p>
<p>“If the Nameless God can’t protect Trajector Searching, it’s useless for you to rush over now.” Holy Lord Trajectory stopped Turtle Snake again.</p>
<p>“Holy Lord, you have been plotting for countless years. If anything happens to the Holy Lady, I’m afraid it will be difficult to find another existence who possesses the bloodlines of the six Holy races. It will be difficult for you to sign a contract with that Nameless God again,” said Turtle Snake.</p>
<p>Holy Lord Trajectory naturally knew that it was impossible for a second Trajectory Seeking to appear. He had plotted for countless years to obtain the top bloodline of the six Holy races and fuse it with her. It was impossible for him to replicate a second existence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Nameless God had already accepted Trajectory Seeking, so it was impossible for him to contract another.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. With the contract of the Nameless God protecting her, even if she’s on Earth, no one can take her life. At most, she will suffer some physical pain. She’s still impetuous, so it’s good to let her get some training.” Holy Lord Trajectory no longer felt conflicted about deducing what had happened.   Instead, he tried his best to conceal the fate related to the Trajectory Seeking to prevent the other Holy Lords or terrifying existences of the Immortals from discovering the anomaly.</p>
<p>The Nameless God wasn’t a real god, but to the six Holy races, it was an existence even more terrifying than a true god.</p>
<p>Back then, the Immortals were supreme. The six Holy races were far from the Immortals’ match and were still underlings. However, they had already secretly formed an alliance and tried all means to overthrow the Immortals’ rule.</p>
<p>One of the plans was called the Nameless God. They used the strongest strength of the six races to create a powerful weapon. The might of the weapon was enough to easily kill an Apocalypse-grade existence.</p>
<p>When Nameless God was born, the six Holy races were overjoyed. They believed that they could rely on the power of Nameless God to overthrow the rule of the Immortals and usher in a new era that belonged to the six Holy races.</p>
<p>However, they soon realized that they were counting their chickens before they hatched. No one could use Nameless God. Back then, the top powerhouses of the six races had attempted to control Nameless God, but none of them succeeded. There was an Apocalypse-grade powerhouse who was too stubborn and ended up provoking Nameless God and being killed.</p>
<p>Later, they learned that Nameless God was a fusion of the six races’ strongest powers. No matter which race’s powerhouse it was, it was impossible for them to match Nameless God perfectly.</p>
<p>Only a Holy Body with the perfect bloodline of the six races could truly control Nameless God.</p>
<p>However, such an existence was believed to be impossible to appear back then. Therefore, it had never been used after Nameless God was created.</p>
<p>Later on, the Immortals mysteriously collapsed. The six Holy races took advantage of the situation and became the new overlords of the dimension. They didn’t use Nameless God at all.</p>
<p>After becoming the new overlord of the dimension, it was difficult for the six Holy races to be as united as before. It was even harder to obtain a perfect Holy Body. Even the six Holy races didn’t wish for Nameless God to be controlled by someone.</p>
<p>However, Holy Lord Trajectory didn’t dispel this thought. He had secretly spent a lot of effort to set up an unimaginable long-term plan. By chance, he finally had Trajectory Seeking born and reached a contract with Nameless God.</p>
<p>However, as Trajectory Seeking hadn’t advanced to the Apocalypse grade, her strength was too weak and she couldn’t really use the abilities of Nameless God. However, with its power, even if it only left a contract mark on her, it was enough to protect her life. Therefore, Holy Lord Trajectory wasn’t too worried about her safety.</p>
<p>What he wanted to know was who had blocked the fate trajectory related to Trajectory Seeking. Did someone already know of the existence of a perfect Holy Body?</p>
<p>After doing the screening work, Holy Lord Trajectory’s gaze passed through endless spacetime and looked at the huge statue in the forbidden zone of the six races. The statue looked like a ghost or devil, a Buddha or a saint, but upon careful inspection, it was no different from a human. However, there was a vertical mark between its brows—the location of the Nameless God.</p>
<p>Now, the vertical mark emitted a demonic white light. It was like a vertical white electric eye that was glaring angrily at a spot in the void.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1760'>Chapter 1760 King Bathed in Holy Light</h3>
<p>The strange white light descended from the sky seemingly without going through any process. It landed on Zhou Wen without any space to dodge. Ignoring Zhou Wen’s present speed, even if his speed was a hundred times faster, it would be difficult for him to dodge the white light that appeared out of thin air.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t flustered. He was no longer the weakling who knew nothing and was always on tenterhooks. He already had a knowledge framework in his heart that could analyze all sorts of unknown powers. For such an impossible-to-block force that directly acted on one’s body, it was impossible for it to be a fatal force, and it was very unlikely a damaging skill.</p>
<p>Indeed, when the white light landed on Zhou Wen, it didn’t harm his body, but it instantly made him feel like he was being suppressed by a mountain. His legs trembled as his knees involuntarily bent.</p>
<p>Instantly, Zhou Wen knew what power it was. He was half right. It wasn’t a power that could directly kill him, but this power would still harm his body. He was too familiar with such power and had seen it countless times.</p>
<p>It was a power similar to the Sigh of the King. No, to be precise, it was similar to the power of the strange woman who resided in his body with the Sigh of the King.</p>
<p>As the woman didn’t have a corporeal body, she naturally couldn’t control corporeal powers. This white light was the same as the woman with the Sigh of the King. They were purely psychic powers.</p>
<p>In this world, the psyche was the most profound thing. Even at Zhou Wen’s level, it was impossible for him to turn his psyche into a corporeal entity. He couldn’t even make a piece of paper fly with his psyche.</p>
<p>No matter how powerful one’s will was, they could only control their bodies and not affect others.</p>
<p>The other skills that looked like they were using the psychic powers for strength control were only using psychic powers to control some kind of power in one’s body. It wasn’t purely the psychic power in action.</p>
<p>It was just like sword intent. Sword intent was a combination of sword force and the psyche. It wasn’t pure psychic power. Such sword intent could only affect the other party’s psyche and not cause any actual damage to matter.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had seen two-and-a-half people who could directly materialize their psyche and use it on external objects.</p>
<p>One was the woman with the Sigh of the King, and the other was this white light. The reason there was another half was that Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if the person was using pure psychic powers.</p>
<p>That half was The Thearch. Since she could make a wish come true, Zhou Wen believed that the wish itself was a psychic power. However, he couldn’t confirm it, so he could only count it as half.</p>
<p>The white beam’s psychic power wasn’t weaker than the Sigh of the King that Zhou Wen had seen before. It was even stronger. It could cross space and force him to bend his knees. The existence of this psychic power was unimaginably powerful.</p>
<p>Are Apocalypse-grade experts that terrifying? Zhou Wen was alarmed. He had already used all his strength, but his knees were still rapidly buckling to the ground.</p>
<p>In fact, not all Apocalypse-grade creatures had such psychic powers. Or rather, it could be said that very few creatures could reach such a level.</p>
<p>The tangible powers transformed from firm willpower and psychic power were on completely different levels. No matter how firm Zhou Wen’s willpower was, he couldn’t stop his legs from bending.</p>
<p>Looking at Zhou Wen’s bent legs, Trajectory Seeking thought to herself, You want to be my teacher and receive my kowtow? I’m just afraid you don’t have the life to accept it.</p>
<p>Trajectory Seeking knew it very well. How arrogant was the pride of a god-like weapon like Nameless God? How could it tolerate its contractor bowing to any other creature?</p>
<p>After three kowtows, Zhou Wen was already a dead person in the eyes of Trajectory Seeking.</p>
<p>I gave you a chance before. You were the one who chose to let me take you as my master. You can’t blame me even if you die. However, it’s not a loss for you to die under the power of Nameless God. If you weren’t an Apocalypse-grade existence, Nameless God wouldn’t have bothered to react. With this in mind, Trajectory Seeking still felt a little uncomfortable. She originally didn’t have any intention to kill, but she had been forced into such a situation. In her anger, she kowtowed. Looking at Zhou Wen who was about to kneel, she thought to herself, Don’t be so eager to be someone else’s teacher in your next life, much less be my teacher.</p>
<p>Li Xuan, Feng Qiuyan, Ming Xiu, Qin Zhen, and company, who were close to Zhou Wen, all had top-notch combat strength among humans. However, just the aftershocks of the white light made them stand rooted to the ground. No matter how they struggled, they couldn’t move at all.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just them. In fact, no one in Guide City could move. Humans with weaker strength and willpower were pressed to the ground.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan, Ming Xiu, and company also fought the force with all their might, but their knees had already fallen to the ground. Despite pressing their hands against the ground, they were still unable to withstand it. Their bodies were about to collapse to the ground.</p>
<p>Li Xuan stood there motionless without bending his knees. All he heard was his bones cracking as broken bones protruded from his flesh.</p>
<p>Qin Zhen propped herself up on the ground with her sword and forced herself not to kneel. However, the sword was quickly pressed into the ground. Her body quickly approached the ground and she had no choice but to lie down.</p>
<p>What kind of existence was Nameless God? With his contractor kneeling on the ground, how could others stand? They couldn’t even kneel, much less stand.</p>
<p>Since Trajectory Seeking was kneeling, everyone could only prostrate themselves.</p>
<p>And this was only the aftershocks from the psychic power. Zhou Wen, who was facing it head-on, had yet to touch the ground with his knees. His strength and will far exceeded everyone’s, but it was still insufficient to resist the power.</p>
<p>Trajectory Seeking closed her eyes. She had already expected the outcome and didn’t wish to see Zhou Wen’s tragic state of being completely destroyed by the psychic power.</p>
<p>Trajectory Seeking closed her eyes and waited for the sound of bones cracking and blood splattering. However, after waiting for quite some time, she only heard the sounds of the people by the side slamming into the ground. She didn’t hear the sound of Zhou Wen’s knees hitting the ground, much less the sounds of bones cracking as she imagined.</p>
<p>Could it be that his body was completely reduced to dust before he could hit the ground because of Nameless God’s wrath? Trajectory Seeking couldn’t help but open her eyes and look at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>In the next second, when she saw things clearly, her eyes widened as though she had seen a ghost. Her face was filled with shock and disbelief.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t reduced to dust as she had imagined, nor was he kneeling on the ground as she had imagined. Zhou Wen was standing there perfectly fine. His knees that had been bent previously were now straight.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just his knees. Even his spine was straight. Even his head was raised high without any signs of looking down and out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood ramrod straight as he raised his head and stared into the void like a king bathed in holy light.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1761'>Chapter 1761 Two Options</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen stared into the void. In fact, he couldn’t see anything. What he was really looking at was the Sigh of the King Life Providence, or rather, the woman that only existed in it.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s strength, he was indeed unable to withstand the Nameless God’s psychic powers. It was the power of the Sigh of the King that resisted the terrifying psychic power. How could an existence that had once stood at the peak of power and had all races submit to her tolerate kneeling to others?</p>
<p>Others couldn’t see it, nor could Zhou Wen, but he could sense that a woman’s phantom seemed to overlap with his body. She was staring into the void as though she was looking at something.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, are you afraid?” A woman’s voice sounded in Zhou Wen’s mind. The voice was clearly beautiful, but it had an indescribable authority. It was difficult to associate it with the word pleasant.</p>
<p>“What’s there to be afraid of?” Zhou Wen didn’t say a word, but only thought of the sentence. It was enough for the owner of the voice to know what Zhou Wen was talking about.</p>
<p>“The owner of this psyche is an extremely powerful existence. Even the leaders of the six races can’t match it. A thought is all it needs to kill you,” the woman continued.</p>
<p>“What are you?” Zhou Wen didn’t answer the question of fear. He wanted to know what kind of existence the woman in his Life Providence was.</p>
<p>In the past, he had felt that there was something wrong with his Life Providence. Now that it could actually speak to him, it made him even more uneasy.</p>
<p>There was actually another consciousness in his body. It knew everything about him and even knew what he was thinking. This made him feel like he was naked in front of a stranger without any sense of security.</p>
<p>“I’m you.” The woman’s answer left Zhou Wen somewhat confused, unsure what she meant.</p>
<p>The woman didn’t continue answering Zhou Wen’s doubts. Instead, she continued, “That existence is extremely terrifying. Ignoring Earth, even in the dimension, it’s a supreme existence. Getting his contractor to kneel in front of you is equivalent to insulting him. He definitely won’t let you live. Are you afraid?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Zhou Wen was indeed afraid. Anyone who was targeted by an existence that could kill them with a thought would be so afraid that they would be unable to eat or sleep. There was no reason to hide the truth. Furthermore, he couldn’t hide it from the woman who knew what he was thinking.</p>
<p>“Although that existence is extremely terrifying, he has a fatal weakness. Without a contractor, he can’t leave the dimension, nor can he sense the information on Earth. Now, you have two choices. One is to kill the girl in front of you. As long as you kill her, the existence will no longer be able to sense the information inside Earth due to the suppression of Earth’s rules. Naturally, it won’t be able to kill you with its psyche,” the woman said.</p>
<p>“What’s the second option?” Zhou Wen asked. “The second option is naturally not to kill the girl. I can temporarily screen his psyche from locking onto you,” the woman added.</p>
<p>“It sounds like the first option is easier.” Zhou Wen changed the topic and continued, “You seem to have something to say.”</p>
<p>“That existence isn’t a creature, or rather, it’s not entirely a creature. He should be a weapon,” the woman said slowly. “It’s not a weapon in the traditional sense, but something similar to what you humans call a Companion Beast. It’s a weapon with its own life and consciousness.</p>
<p>“But no matter what kind of weapon he is, as long as he’s a weapon, a host has to use him. However, a weapon like him has extremely harsh requirements for the host. It’s almost impossible to find another existence like the girl in the dimension.”</p>
<p>“In that case, as long as I kill her, I can settle it once and for all?” Zhou Wen pondered.</p>
<p>“At the very least, it’s impossible for an existence like the girl to appear in a short period of time. Even if such an existence appears in the future, it will be countless years later. With the lifespan of humans, I’m afraid you won’t be able to live to that day. To you, it’s considered a done deal,” the woman said indifferently.</p>
<p>“In that case, why did you mention the second option? This second option shouldn’t be as simple as you say, right?” Zhou Wen said in thought.</p>
<p>“If the girl can live, she can truly use that weapon and liberate it after advancing to the Apocalypse grade. Only then will you have a chance to snatch it.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“Lost Immortal Sutra… With the Lost Immortal Sutra, as long as you defeat the girl with that weapon, you might be able to snatch it for your own use. However, this is very dangerous. The girl’s talent far exceeds yours. After advancing to the Apocalypse grade, she will be an extremely powerful existence. With the power of that weapon, no one in the dimension can match her. If you want to defeat her and snatch that weapon, it’s almost equivalent to courting death.”</p>
<p>“In that case, why should I snatch it?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“Because Earth doesn’t have time left.” The woman continued, “The reason he can send his psyche to Earth to kill you is partly because he’s extremely powerful and has a contractor providing positioning here. However, ultimately, it’s because the restrictions on Earth are already very weak. In a few years, the extremely terrifying existences in the dimension will descend to Earth. When that happens, even if humans aren’t wiped out, they will probably be reduced to slaves. Only by obtaining that weapon can you storm into the dimension and suppress all races, preventing the ill fate of human extermination.”</p>
<p>“What you said is contradictory. If I can defeat the girl with that weapon, do I still need that weapon?” Zhou Wen could tell that something was amiss.</p>
<p>“It’s not contradictory. You only have one chance, and that is to enter the dimension. When she advances to the Apocalypse grade and obtains that weapon, you can use the short period she needs to break into the weapon to sneak an attack and defeat her while she can’t completely unleash the weapon’s might. No matter how powerful the weapon is, it ultimately needs a host to use it,” the woman said indifferently. “However, it’s too difficult. You have to enter the dimension alone and find the girl while she liberates the weapon. You also have to defeat a powerhouse that’s almost at the peak of the Apocalypse grade. It can be said it’s an ending that spells almost certain doom.”</p>
<p>“There’s no chance of survival. Since there’s no chance, why should I take this path?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“Of course, you can choose not to. With your abilities, even if Earth completely breaks out of its seal, you might be able to find a place to hide in the universe. Life-preservation shouldn’t be a problem,” the woman said indifferently. “You can live by taking the first option. The second option is to give you and humanity a miracle. It’s up to you how you choose.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1762'>Chapter 1762 My World Doesn’t Have Dead Ends</h3>
<p>“Between surviving and creating a miracle, what will you choose?” The woman’s voice echoed in Zhou Wen’s mind.</p>
<p>“I choose to live to create a miracle,” Zhou Wen said calmly.</p>
<p>The woman had given Zhou Wen a framework, but he didn’t believe that this framework was an ironclad principle that couldn’t be transcended. Both paths were paths that the woman had set herself. Why did he have to choose the path that the woman had set?</p>
<p>The so-called two options the woman proposed weren’t the best choice for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Live on or create miracles. You can only choose one. There’s no third option,” the woman said.</p>
<p>“That’s your path, not mine,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Oh, then tell me, what’s your path?” the woman asked.</p>
<p>“Nothing is absolute in my path. Be it the girl or that weapon, they won’t be a necessary existence for me,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You mean that you won’t snatch that weapon, nor will you kill the girl?” the woman frowned.</p>
<p>“No, I’ll do my best to snatch that weapon, but even if I can’t obtain it, it’s not a dead end for me,” Zhou Wen said firmly.</p>
<p>“Make it clear,” the woman pressed.</p>
<p>“As long as I’m not dead, my world doesn’t have dead ends,” Zhou Wen enunciated each word clearly.</p>
<p>“No dead ends?” The woman ruminated over Zhou Wen’s words as her voice gradually turned odd. “Even such a supreme existence isn’t a dead end for you? Do you still want to become an existence that can surpass him? The ignorant are truly fearless. I’m afraid you don’t know what kind of existence it is, but… I like it… Then let me see… where your end is…”</p>
<p>With the woman’s voice, her psychic power suddenly rose and spewed out like a volcano.</p>
<p>Trajectory Seeking looked at Zhou Wen with an odd expression. Zhou Wen stood in the corporeal white light for several seconds, but he remained composed as though he hadn’t been injured at all.</p>
<p>As for the humans beside him, existences as powerful as Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu were already prostrating on the ground, unable to move.</p>
<p>How is this possible! He can actually withstand the will of Nameless God? Trajectory Seeking found it unbelievable. In the next second, her eyes reflected the beauty of fireworks as her eyes widened to their limits.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>An invisible force seemed to spew out from Zhou Wen’s body as the white light enveloping him shattered. It scattered like fireworks before disappearing.</p>
<p>The terrifying white pillar of light seemed to be pierced by a sharp blade as it instantly collapsed, turning into streams of light that scattered before disappearing.</p>
<p>The will of Nameless God… was actually crushed… Trajectory Seeking almost couldn’t believe her eyes. Amidst the gorgeous white streams of light, Zhou Wen’s figure was like a god. It seemed to fog Trajectory Seeking’s eyes, preventing her from seeing clearly.</p>
<p>As the white pillar of light dissipated, the extremely black sky returned to its sunny state. It was no longer as strange as before.</p>
<p>The pressure on the residents of Guide City vanished as they stood up.</p>
<p>Trajectory Seeking looked up at Zhou Wen in a daze for a long time.</p>
<p>In the dimension, Holy Lord Trajectory’s pupils suddenly constricted as a look of horror that had never been seen in millennia appeared on his face.</p>
<p>In the forbidden zone of the six races, the white vertical eye on the stone statue exploded. Instantly, the white light vanished and it returned to its previous cracked state. On both sides of the vertical mark, many tiny cracks appeared like spiderwebs.</p>
<p>The power of Nameless God’s psyche has actually suffered a backlash… This is impossible… How can there be such a terrifying lifeform on Earth… Could it be that the Immortal went missing on Earth because… Holy Lord Trajectory’s mind flickered as he found it difficult to control himself.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen retracted his gaze and looked at the kneeling Trajectory Seeking in front of him. He thought to himself, What do you mean that the weapon is a supreme existence? Isn’t it clearly inferior to you? What are you? Why did you become my Life Providence? Where does the Lost Immortal Sutra come from? However, the woman didn’t respond to his thoughts. The Sigh of the King Life Providence had already converged, and there was no movement from it. It was dead silent.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen thought of something. Ever since he had the Sigh of the King Life Providence, no matter how powerful an existence was, they couldn’t make him kneel. Only once did he kneel.</p>
<p>Back then, Zhou Wen believed that Demonic Neonate’s cooperation with the suona was too powerful, so the Sigh of the King didn’t react.</p>
<p>But from the looks of it, he had underestimated the power of the Sigh of the King. The reason for her not appearing and allowing him to kneel probably wasn’t because the woman knew that she couldn’t stop Zhou Wen from kneeling.</p>
<p>With the way the woman defeated the psychic power, it would probably only take a thought for her to kill Demonic Neonate with the suona.</p>
<p>Could it be… Zhou Wen thought of a possibility as his expression turned odd.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t because Demonic Neonate and the suona were too powerful, there was only one possibility left. It was that Zhou Wen had no choice but to kneel back then. Even the Sigh of the King had no reason to stop it.</p>
<p>Could the reason… be that corpse? After some thought, Zhou Wen could only think of this possibility. Back then, other than the corpse, he really couldn’t think of anything nearby that would make the Sigh of the King not react to his kneeling.</p>
<p>“Are… Are you really human?” Trajectory Seeking’s voice interrupted Zhou Wen’s thoughts. She looked at him with a lost look.</p>
<p>Ever since she was young, the thoughts that Holy Lord Trajectory had instilled in her were that Nameless God was an invincible existence. Once she truly controlled Nameless God, she could rule the world. Even if the Immortal from before was revived, she didn’t believe that she would lose.</p>
<p>However, Nameless God’s psychic power was actually defeated. This completely overturned her world view, causing her confidence in herself and Nameless God to waver.</p>
<p>“Since you have already acknowledged me as your master, you have to abide by the rules. You have to greet me as ‘Teacher’ in the future, understand?” Zhou Wen said indifferently as he looked at her.</p>
<p>Trajectory Seeking’s beliefs wavered, and she couldn’t think of anything to refute Zhou Wen. All she did was look at him in a daze as though she had tacitly agreed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the Cube emitted light as another creature attempted the level. Zhou Wen turned his head and realized that it was another human. Furthermore, he was rather familiar with this person.</p>
<p>He wore a white robe, revealing his fair and firm chest. His long hair cascaded down wantonly as he casually placed a sheathed sword on his shoulder. He looked languid and wild, as though he wasn’t here to clear the level but to enjoy the sun.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1763'>Chapter 1763 His Brother</h3>
<p>What is Zhong Ziya trying to do? Zhou Wen frowned slightly.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya had always been at odds with the dimension. Others wanted to become Guardians or representatives, but his organization was hunting Guardians and representatives. This time, he had actually taken the initiative to show his face and clear the level. Wasn’t he afraid that the dimension would target him?</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan were two extremes. Jiang Yan was willing to come into contact with the dimension by learning from them, but Zhong Ziya believed that Guardians and alien representatives were no different from traitors who should be killed quickly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t that extreme. Between Guardians and representatives, there were some that deserved killing and others that didn’t. There was no generalization.</p>
<p>Upon seeing another human attempt the level, everyone immediately became excited. With so many humans clearing the level in a row, the gloom that had enveloped their hearts over the past few days was lifted.</p>
<p>They were all discussing who this person was. Not many people had seen Zhong Ziya’s true face, but there were many who knew the name “Ya.” They just couldn’t associate Ya with Zhong Ziya.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya wasn’t like the previous challengers. He didn’t fly in the air but landed on the lake. Only then did people realize that he wasn’t wearing any shoes. His bare feet stepped on the lake, causing the surface to ripple slightly.</p>
<p>This man… is so beautiful… Many women and even men watching the livestream couldn’t help but have this thought flash through their minds.</p>
<p>Previously, Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan were undoubtedly rare handsome men, but their handsomeness had some traces of youth. Although Zhong Ziya wasn’t old, he had an indescribable beauty.</p>
<p>It was feral, mature, sexy, and even somewhat charming. Just him standing there made one feel their hormones screaming. To exaggerate, if he were a cat, just passing by would be enough to make a female cat on the roadside go into heat.</p>
<p>He was beautiful, but not feminine. He was seductive, but not gaudy. Furthermore, he had a strong dangerous aura. Many women found it difficult to move their eyes away from him.</p>
<p>Pulling out the sword!</p>
<p>As people admired Zhong Ziya’s face, he pulled out the sword on his shoulder.</p>
<p>The unsheathing and sheathing of the sword was done in a swift, fluid manner. It allowed one to see it clearly. However, upon careful inspection, the sword had already returned to its scabbard and was still casually placed on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Many people couldn’t understand what Zhong Ziya’s casual strike was about.</p>
<p>He has grown too quickly. Zhou Wen sighed.</p>
<p>In the past, Zhong Ziya’s sword techniques were wild. Zhou Wen found such a sword art very strong, but it didn’t pose him any danger.</p>
<p>Now, Zhong Ziya’s sword technique looked reserved, but it made Zhou Wen feel extreme danger.</p>
<p>If the Zhong Ziya in the past was a ferocious devil that made people afraid just by looking at him, then the present him was an elegant and beautiful devil in hell.</p>
<p>It looked harmless, but it had the ability to make one wish they were dead.</p>
<p>After the strike, Zhong Ziya slowly walked barefooted on the surface of the lake without sinking like the people who had previously failed.</p>
<p>Splash!</p>
<p>Not long after Zhong Ziya walked over, the water where he was standing churned as a huge object floated up from the water.</p>
<p>The object was like a crystal-like octopus. Every tentacle was dozens of meters long and it was covered in suction cups. Its entire body was transparent.</p>
<p>It was likely the culprit behind pulling people to the bottom of the lake.</p>
<p>However, it was now floating-a clear sign that it was dead. There was a sword mark that was as thin as a strand of hair on its head. It didn’t look long. If one didn’t look carefully, they wouldn’t discover the existence of the sword mark.</p>
<p>However, it had died just like that. Instantly, the people watching the livestream were dumbfounded. Their mouths gaped open for a long time.</p>
<p>“This man is truly perfect. He’s beautiful and valiant. If I can marry him, I can die in</p>
<p>peace.”</p>
<p>“If I could marry him, I’d be willing to live ten years less.”</p>
<p>“I don’t need to marry him. I would accept death if I could sleep with him once.”</p>
<p>Just like how men admired beautiful women, women also liked to admire beautiful men. Zhong Ziya was undoubtedly a rare and charming man, so it was no wonder they were like this.</p>
<p>Most men were wondering who this man was. His sword was casual, not as ingenious as Ming Xiu’s, nor was it as domineering as Qin Zhen’s. But now that they thought about it, his sword was even more terrifying. Just looking at it gave them goosebumps.</p>
<p>This was the first time someone had killed the monster in the lake, and it was also the first time people had seen the monster.</p>
<p>However, no one was in the mood to study what monster it was. Everyone’s eyes were attracted by the unique man, eager to know who he was.</p>
<p>In particular, the members of the six families were about to go crazy.</p>
<p>The appearance of Ming Xiu, Feng Qiuyan, and Qin Zhen had already made them feel a strong sense of danger. Now, not only did this man make them feel a sense of danger, but they also urgently wanted to know who this man was.</p>
<p>Everyone stared at Zhong Ziya as he proceeded through the fog. He casually walked step by step and soon, he passed through the fog and stepped ashore. The golden fruit tree was right in front of him.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya walked to the bottom of the golden fruit tree and held the sword on his shoulder with one hand. He extended his other hand and casually plucked a golden apple.</p>
<p>“This…”</p>
<p>Previously, Ming Xiu’s first strike hadn’t been able to slice off the golden apple, but Zhong Ziya had casually plucked it. Such an ability left one speechless for a description.</p>
<p>The scene changed and became the Cube’s ranking. Although many women felt that they had not seen enough and wanted to take a few more glances at Zhong Ziya, they also wanted to know who this man was.</p>
<p>The moment the ranking appeared, everyone looked at the top for some reason. Although there was no way to explain why, everyone believed that he should be ranked there.</p>
<p>Indeed, the first name on the ranking changed. When people saw the name clearly, they were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen’s brother!” Someone couldn’t help but recite.</p>
<p>The words were very simple. There was a name in it, but everyone knew that the owner of this name wasn’t the devil-like handsome man.</p>
<p>“Has Zhou’s people finished taking all the elites of the mortal world?”</p>
<p>“No wonder he’s so awesome… He’s Ming Xiu’s uncle!”</p>
<p>“The Zhous… are amazing…”</p>
<p>“How can this be? Are the Zhous going to dominate the rankings?” “How can you blame the Zhous for dominating the rankings? It’s clearly those cowards from the other families who don’t dare to make an attempt.”</p>
<p>As people were discussing crazily, the Cube lit up again. Another person was attempting the level, and it was another human. The first thought in everyone’s minds was: Could this be another member of the Zhous?</p>
<h3 id='chapter1764'>Chapter 1764 All Plucked</h3>
<p>This dimensional zone had appeared for a long time. By the time Ming Xiu started plucking the golden apple, there were only five golden fruits left on the tree. Ming Xiu, Feng Qiuyan, Qin Zhen, and Zhong Ziya had plucked four of them, leaving the last golden fruit.</p>
<p>Upon seeing another human attempt the level, everyone felt very pleased. Regardless of whether this was from Zhous or not, it was fine as long as it was plucked by a human. At the very least, the remaining five golden apples had been all taken by humans, wiping away the shame from before.</p>
<p>“Who is this person? Why are the ones making an attempt today all unfamiliar faces!”</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’ve seen this one before. It’s another young expert. From the looks of it, there are really all kinds of hidden young talents on Earth.”</p>
<p>“I wonder if it’s from the Zhous again.”</p>
<p>“I have a feeling that this guy should also be from the Zhous.”</p>
<p>“Another unfamiliar face. It has to be from the Zhous.”</p>
<p>“What do you know? All of you are only wondering if that person is from the Zhous. None of you realize what’s really important.”</p>
<p>“Sure, smart alec. Tell us what’s important.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you guys realize that this is the last golden apple? If this golden apple is plucked, the Cube’s battle should be over. Then, the person ranked first will obtain the reward. Previously, the rewards from those planets were planetary Companion Beasts. Then, if this is the dimension, what will the reward be?”</p>
<p>“Now that you mention it, it does seem like it. Since this is the last golden apple, this is going to determine first place.”</p>
<p>“In that case, if nothing goes wrong, first place will definitely be obtained by us humans. It’s either Zhou Wen’s brother or this young man…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be surprised when he saw the man. It was Liu Yun, who he hadn’t seen in a while.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was known as Thief Sage. He had many means to change his appearance, but this time, he didn’t disguise himself. Instead, he entered the Cube with his true appearance.</p>
<p>However, it could be seen that this fellow had carefully dressed up. He was wearing a gorgeous robe and looked like he was dressed like a cultivator. He looked mysterious, holy, and solemn.</p>
<p>This fellow had even dyed his hair gray. He had wiped away his usual cheeky look, and he wore a solemn expression. At a glance, he really looked lofty.</p>
<p>What’s this fellow thinking? Is his brain damaged? Zhou Wen was somewhat speechless.</p>
<p>As Thief Sage, he had stolen many things from the various families. Once people discovered what he looked like, it would probably be difficult for him to show his true face again. Once he appeared, he would be hunted by everyone.</p>
<p>Thankfully, few families had seen Liu Yun’s true face. There were even fewer who knew that Liu Yun was Thief Sage. Liu Yun changed from his usual self. He stood there like a lofty son of god with his arrogant and solemn expression.</p>
<p>Everyone waited to see how he would clear the level, but Liu Yun stood there without walking forward. He had no intention of killing the monster in the lake.</p>
<p>“For me to be here personally, are you not offering me the fruit immediately? Am I to personally retrieve it?” Liu Yun suddenly said as he levitated above the lake.</p>
<p>This sentence left everyone dumbfounded. They looked at him as though they were looking at a fool.</p>
<p>Someone could be impressive and be good at posturing, but one couldn’t go too far. If they went too far, they would become a fool. Now, Liu Yun had gone too far.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, does this fellow think he’s the Jade Emperor? He even wants them to offer the fruit to him. Is he crazy?”</p>
<p>“I think there’s a high chance that this person is crazy. Who would do something like that?”</p>
<p>“Is this fellow here to perform a comedic skit?”</p>
<p>Everyone felt that Liu Yun was posturing too much, to the point of being a little silly. Ignoring the fact that he was only a human, even a supreme existence in the dimension wouldn’t order a tree to offer up its fruit.</p>
<p>Just as everyone was prepared to watch a good show and wait to see how Liu Yun would finish, they saw an angry expression appear on Liu Yun’s face. He shouted coldly, “From the looks of it, you want me to do it myself?”</p>
<p>Just as he said that, Liu Yun reached out and grabbed at the fog in front of him.</p>
<p>He hadn’t moved at all since he entered. His grab looked like a joke, rendering the spectators speechless. They felt that he had definitely gone mad. However, in the next second, everyone widened their eyes. After Liu Yun casually grabbed, a golden apple appeared in his palm out of thin air and was firmly held by his fingers.</p>
<p>“What a chore to have me do it myself.” As Liu Yun muttered to himself, the Cube’s screen switched to the Cube’s ranking.</p>
<p>Instantly, the humans watching the battle fell silent. If Zhong Ziya’s performance was still within their understanding, then Liu Yun’s performance had far exceeded their understanding. They didn’t know how to describe their feelings.</p>
<p>“This is too sick!”</p>
<p>“What happened just now?”</p>
<p>“That works too? Is that fellow really the Jade Emperor?”</p>
<p>As everyone was exclaiming, the ranking changed again. A new name replaced second place.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen’s Eldest Brother! Holy sh*t, no wonder he’s so strong. So he’s Zhou Wen’s eldest brother!”</p>
<p>“What’s up with this ranking? Why do I feel that this eldest brother is stronger than that brother from before? He should be first, right?”</p>
<p>“I think this one is stronger too, but they’re family anyway. It doesn’t matter who’s ahead and who’s behind.”</p>
<p>“Are the people from the Zhous that impressive?” “I’m afraid the Zhous will become the number one faction on Earth in the future. They are too powerful. The six families are nothing in front of the Zhous.”</p>
<p>“I wonder how strong that Zhou Wen is. Unfortunately, there aren’t any golden apples left. Otherwise, we could see how strong he</p>
<p>is.”</p>
<p>“I wonder how many brothers of this caliber Zhou Wen has?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t do anything, but his name went viral across the Federation. Many people were discussing Ming Xiu and company, but the person who was discussed the most was Zhou Wen himself.</p>
<p>Although he hadn’t done anything, it was precisely because he hadn’t done anything that people wanted to know what kind of existence the person who had so many experts around him was.</p>
<p>However, what was strange was that although all the golden apples had been plucked, the Cube’s battle didn’t end. They could still continue entering the Cube to clear the level.</p>
<p>“The dimension’s dimensional zone is indeed not that simple. Just plucking the golden apple doesn’t allow one to obtain the final victory.” Zhou Wen had expected this, so he wasn’t surprised.</p>
<p>“Do you want to know why it didn’t end?”. Trajectory Seeking, who had been standing by the side, suddenly asked with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>“You know the answer?” Zhou Wen looked at Trajectory Seeking.</p>
<p>“Of course, I’m just afraid that you won’t dare to challenge the level after I tell you,” Trajectory Seeking said with a pout.</p>
<p>“Tell me about it.” Zhou Wen looked at Trajectory Seeking with interest.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1765'>Chapter 1765 Tomb of the Fallen Gods</h3>
<p>“The golden fruit tree isn’t the end,” said Trajector Seeking.</p>
<p>“That’s strange. Since the golden fruit tree isn’t the end, why did the Cube automatically end the battle after plucking the golden apple?” Zhou Wen asked. Aww</p>
<p>“What do you think that place is? It’s not some trash dimensional zone in Earth’s universe, but a dimensional zone in the dimension.” Trajectory Seeking continued disdainfully, “There’s no teleportation nexus in the Lake of Oblivion. The only way to leave is to pluck the golden fruit. Only ignorant humans like you think that the fellows on the rankings are the only ones in the dimension? In fact, those fellows are just inferior fellows in the dimension. There are too many experts who can pluck the golden fruits. The reason there are still golden fruits left is that they are reserved for the Lake of Oblivion’s exploration. However, they have all been plucked by ignorant humans like you. Now, unless you can really clear the level, you won’t be able to leave the Lake of Oblivion.”</p>
<p>“It sounds like the dimension doesn’t know much about the Lake of Oblivion. What you said is something the dimension had just learned about, right?” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>Trajectory Seeking didn’t deny it as she curled her lips and said, “Even in the dimension, the Lake of Oblivion is a famous existence. Many people know about it, but not many people dare explore it.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Because that’s the Tomb of the Fallen Gods,” said Trajectory Seeking. “I never expected the dimension to have gods,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>The creatures in the dimension were no different from gods and devils to humans. Furthermore, among the many races in the dimension, there were ghosts and immortals.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised that there was the concept of a god in a place like theirs.</p>
<p>“Humph, the gods of the dimension are completely different from the gods of you humans. To you humans, gods are just a form of spiritual faith that doesn’t really exist. And in the dimension, gods are only a race, not something imaginary like what you humans imagine.” Ever since Trajectory Seeking had become his disciple, she felt uncomfortable beside Zhou Wen. Her words were even more biting than before.</p>
<p>“Then the Tomb of the Fallen Gods is where the Gods bury their clansmen? In that case, the Gods must know the place very well. Why don’t they challenge themselves?” Zhou Wen asked the question in his mind.</p>
<p>“If the Gods hadn’t completely gone extinct, why would that place be called the Tomb of the Fallen Gods?” Trajectory Seeking roughly explained the situation.</p>
<p>The Gods were originally a very powerful race in the dimension, an existence that was comparable to the Immortals. When the Immortals and Gods fought for supremacy in the dimension, they were almost evenly matched for a long period of time.</p>
<p>However, one day, the birthplace of the Gods was suddenly destroyed. The Gods became extinct as a result. Almost no God survived.</p>
<p>There was no accurate explanation for how the Gods were destroyed.</p>
<p>The most accepted explanation was that they had been exterminated by the Immortals, but the Immortals had never admitted to this matter, so no one could be sure of the actual situation.</p>
<p>Many races in the dimension knew that it was an extremely majestic divine mountain in the past. The divine mountain was almost comparable to a world. It could accommodate all life, and there were countless magical objects inside.</p>
<p>However, the divine mountain vanished overnight. The spot where the divine mountain was originally located turned into an unfathomable lake. Later on, many experts from the various races entered, hoping to figure out the secret of the Gods’ overnight destruction, but they never returned-none returned.</p>
<p>The Land of Oblivion referred to the place where the divine mountain sank. It also had the meaning of obliviating all things. No creature dared to enter.</p>
<p>If not for the Cube activating the battle in the Land of Oblivion, the dimensional powerhouses probably wouldn’t have dared enter.</p>
<p>The dimension didn’t know much more about the Land of Oblivion than humanity. After their previous analysis, they realized that the golden fruit was only an item used to leave the Land of Oblivion, not the true key.</p>
<p>Even Apocalypse-grade powerhouses weren’t willing to risk entering the Land of Oblivion. Otherwise, how could humans pluck the golden fruits?</p>
<p>“Now that you know the true secret of the Land of Oblivion, do you still dare challenge it?” Trajectory Seeking goaded Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Now that you mention it, I really don’t dare,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Humph.” Trajectory Seeking was somewhat exasperated, but she knew that it was indeed difficult for Zhou Wen to clear the level now.</p>
<p>Even the Apocalypse-grade big shots in the dimension didn’t dare take the risk. As long as there was nothing wrong with Zhou Wen’s brain, he definitely wouldn’t choose to take the risk now.</p>
<p>“Do you dare?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“So what if I don’t dare? I’m not a teacher,” Trajectory Seeking said angrily.</p>
<p>“Great. As your teacher, I’ll teach you something today,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You want to challenge the Land of Oblivion now?” Trajectory Seeking widened her eyes as she looked at Zhou Wen as though she was looking at a fool.</p>
<p>“That’s right. As your teacher, I naturally have to teach you something you don’t know. Otherwise, how can I be your teacher?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>He naturally didn’t really want to teach Trajectory Seeking, nor would he risk his life for this. The reason he chose to challenge the level now was that he had seen something in the Land of Oblivion.</p>
<p>Previously, Zhou Wen hadn’t paid much attention to the Land of Oblivion, but this time, when Ming Xiu and company attempted the level, Zhou Wen watched very seriously, especially when Ming Xiu attempted the level because Zhou Wen was somewhat worried.</p>
<p>Although he had already taught Ming Xiu and company how to pluck the golden apples, he would have still been worried despite having 100% confidence.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen watched very seriously. This was also why he saw something that he originally believed couldn’t exist in the dimension.</p>
<p>It was a tiny palm symbol on the golden fruit tree. It was the symbol of a downloadable dungeon for the phone. It was quite surprising that the dimension had a tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>The origins of the phone were even more mysterious than Zhou Wen imagined. Even the dimension had a mark, so what kind of existence was the person who created the phone? Zhou Wen found it unimaginable.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to take a picture of the tiny palm symbol after Qin Zhen cleared the level, but Zhong Ziya and Liu Yun beat him to it.</p>
<p>However, it didn’t matter. As long as he downloaded the tiny palm symbol and attempted the level in-game, he could still come out unscathed with the experience.</p>
<p>Of course, there was another more important reason for Zhou Wen’s confidence. He realized that the Sigh of the King was stronger than he had imagined. This gave him the confidence and guarantee.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if you are ignorant or fearless. If you wish to die, I won’t stop you. Don’t blame me if you die. I didn’t force you to go.” From Trajectory Seeking’s point of view, if Zhou Wen really went, it would be no different from tempting fate.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1766'>Chapter 1766 New World</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else as he walked towards the Cube.</p>
<p>It’s been a while since I’ve tried entering the Cube. Zhou Wen stood on the Cube and felt ambivalent. If he had a choice, he would rather game than take the risk himself.</p>
<p>However, the dimensional zone this time had a different meaning. If he could download it, it would be a great boon to his future understanding of the dimension.</p>
<p>As the Cube lit up, Zhou Wen’s figure vanished.</p>
<p>“It’s Zhou Wen!” The host, Su Yi, immediately shouted when she saw Zhou Wen’s figure appear in the Lake of Fog. Her shouting ‘Zhou Wen’ seemed to have immense magical power as it attracted everyone’s attention.</p>
<p>Due to Ming Xiu and company, everyone in the Federation wanted to know what Zhou Wen looked like and what kind of person he was. They were just too curious.</p>
<p>Their first impression didn’t take their breath away; many people were somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked withdrawn and handsomehe didn’t have the wildness and charm like Zhong Ziya, nor was he as noble as Liu Yun who looked like the son of god. He didn’t even have the youthfulness of Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>The feeling Zhou Wen gave off was that he was a rather handsome ordinary person. If one had to say something good about him, it was that his figure wasn’t bad. His slender and muscular figure was streamlined without any especially exaggerated muscles.</p>
<p>“Preposterous!” An Tianzuo slammed the table with a nasty expression.</p>
<p>It was fine if Ming Xiu and company had attempted the level previously, but there were still golden fruits back then, so there wasn’t much risk. However, now that the golden fruits had been plucked, no one knew what would happen if they entered. Exiting became a question.</p>
<p>“He’s letting it get to his head after some tiny achievements. How can he do anything big in the future?” An Tianzuo was infuriated, and his tone was naturally nasty. “Overseer, don’t worry too much. With Feng Qiuyan and company, as well as his two brothers scouting ahead, Young Master Wen should have some confidence. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have gone in,” An Sheng consoled.</p>
<p>“Who’s his brother? Are those fools worthy of being his brother?” An Tianzuo was even more infuriated. “Is what those idiots did called scouting? That’s more like creating a dead end. Only that punk has these riffraff that deserve being executed.”</p>
<p>An Sheng didn’t dare continue the conversation. He muttered softly under his breath-in a voice that could only be heard by himself, “Right, and only you are worthy.”</p>
<p>“What did you say?” An Tianzuo glared at him.</p>
<p>“I said that Young Master Wen only has one brother. Those two fellows went overboard by shamelessly impersonating as one,” An Sheng hurriedly said, afire with noble indignation.</p>
<p>“Who’s his brother? Do you think I, An Tianzuo, have such an idiot younger brother?” An Tianzuo snorted coldly and continued, “Bring me the recently researched combat suit.”</p>
<p>“Overseer, what are you trying to do?” An Sheng was immediately alarmed.</p>
<p>“Nothing. Can’t I take it out to take a look?” An Tianzuo said coldly, “Ah Sheng, you’ve been talking more and more recently. Do my orders have to get your approval?”</p>
<p>“Overseer, how would I dare? I’ll get it now.” An Sheng hurriedly saluted and left, but he prayed inwardly. Please let nothing happen to Young Master Wen. Otherwise, this would be a bad joke. A life might even be lost.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen floated above the lake and felt his body being suppressed by a strange force. This feeling wasn’t unfamiliar. He had been to the dimension when he was weak. The dimension was filled with such power. Creatures below the Mythical stage had no space to survive in the dimension. It was impossible to even see what the world looked like.</p>
<p>Humans on Earth could see the appearance of the Lake of Oblivion because the Cube’s broadcast had screened the power’s interference. People inside didn’t share such benefits.</p>
<p>However, with Zhou Wen’s present standard, such powers naturally couldn’t do a thing to him.</p>
<p>Due to Trajectory Seeking’s existence, Zhou Wen didn’t use any other identities. Some things couldn’t be used. After some thought, he summoned a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast Zhou Wen summoned was Demonic Neonate, who had just woken up from her slumber.</p>
<p>The last time Zhou Wen dug out the mysterious phone’s charger in the ancient well, he had discovered a skeleton. The skeleton was wearing a purple crystal pendant. Demonic Neonate had entered an evolutionary state after swallowing the purple crystal. He had been unable to summon her. It was only recently when Zhou Wen was teaching Ming Xiu and company that he had sensed the reestablishment of a mental connection with Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>After evolving, Demonic Neonate had already reached the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate: Calamity (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Child of Dimension</p>
<p>Life Soul: Supreme True Demon</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: One Spin.</p>
<p>Terror Form: Great Demon King (S-grade)</p>
<p>Calamity Zone: Demon Domain (Heaven level)</p>
<p>New World: Demon Realm</p>
<p>Strength: 1000</p>
<p>Speed: 1000</p>
<p>Constitution: 1000</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 1000</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Demonic Sword, Heaven Shrouding Bell, Suona</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>Mystic Thearch’s peak Calamity stats were 999. That sufficiently surprised Zhou Wen, making him believe that it was the apex of a Calamity creature. It was impossible for one to have higher stats.</p>
<p>However, Demonic Neonate had actually evolved to the Heaven level. Furthermore, her stats were all at 1000. She had one more point than Mystic Thearch. More importantly, Demonic Neonate had a new ability, New World. He didn’t know what it was for.</p>
<p>According to past experience, Demonic Neonate had a Calamity Zone when she was at the Terror grade. Then, the New World ability that the Calamity-grade Demonic Neonate now had was probably an ability that only the Apocalypse grade had.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate was also one of the reasons Zhou Wen dared to enter to snap the picture.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate’s image didn’t change much. She still looked like the purple-robed girl from before. She held the Demonic Sword in her arms, but the Heaven Shrouding Bell and suona had vanished. It was unknown where she had hidden them.</p>
<p>Everyone found it novel that Zhou Wen had summoned a Companion Beast that resembled a human girl.</p>
<p>Although the few humans who had successfully cleared the level previously had also used Companion Beasts, they had all appeared in weapon or armor form. The main combat strength remained human.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned his Companion Beast in its original form, probably planning on using it as his main combat strength. This was a first.</p>
<p>As more and more Guardians and representatives appeared, the effects of human Companion Beasts seemed to weaken. Very few Companion Beasts could fight top-notch representatives. In such situations, the chances of Companion Beasts appearing were decreasing, especially top-notch battles that were carried by Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Many people were looking forward to seeing what abilities Zhou Wen’s adorable and cold humanoid Companion Beast had.</p>
<p>After Demonic Neonate came out, she floated beside Zhou Wen and glanced at the lake. The Demonic Sword in her arms suddenly jumped out of its scabbard and plunged into the lake.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1767'>Chapter 1767 Digging the Tree</h3>
<p>The tiny Demonic Sword rushed into the lake without forming any ripples. Moments later, the lake suddenly rippled as the monster floated belly up.</p>
<p>As the octopus-like monster died, the fog over the Lake of Fog dissipated, revealing a clean lake surface and the nearby island with the golden fruit tree on it.</p>
<p>“What a powerful Companion Beast!”</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, it’s fine if the people around Zhou Wen are that strong, but even his Companion Beast is crazy strong!”</p>
<p>“I beg for the origins of this Companion Beast.”</p>
<p>“Can Companion Beasts be that strong?”</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate’s first appearance stunned the entire Federation. It had been a long time since they had seen such a powerful Companion Beast appear. It comforted the people who were already starting to doubt the powers of Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>However, people were still puzzled. Without the golden apple, what could Zhou Wen do even if he arrived in front of the golden fruit tree? Was he going to dig out the golden fruit tree and bring it back?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen led Demonic Neonate towards the golden fruit tree. There was no other danger along the way as he successfully got ashore and arrived in front of the golden fruit tree.</p>
<p>Everyone stared at Zhou Wen to see what plans he had. Without the golden apple, what could he do?</p>
<p>In the next second, everyone widened their eyes as they saw Zhou Wen take out his phone and snap a picture of the golden fruit tree. He didn’t look like he was clearing the level, but like a tourist who was taking a picture at a landmark as a memento.</p>
<p>The dimension’s dimensional zone that gave people a sense of danger suddenly didn’t seem that dangerous.</p>
<p>Is he there to clear the level or be on vacation? No one could help but have this question rise up in their minds.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a few photos of the golden fruit tree. It was just for show. All he really needed was to take a picture of the tiny palm symbol on the golden fruit tree.</p>
<p>After snapping the tiny palm symbol, the phone screen displayed the words ‘downloading’. It calmed Zhou Wen down significantly.</p>
<p>Indeed, I can download the dungeon. Could it be that the phone’s origins are related to the dimension? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>As he was thinking, he didn’t idle. He summoned another Companion Beast.</p>
<p>It was Imperial Lord Behemoth, who he hadn’t used in a long time. Imperial Lord Behemoth, who had just reached the threshold of the Calamity grade, was naturally not as powerful as Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>However, Imperial Lord Behemoth was very suitable for physical labor.</p>
<p>When people saw the majestic Imperial Lord Behemoth appear, they immediately thought of something. A thought couldn’t help but appear in their minds. Don’t tell me he really wants to dig up the golden fruit tree?</p>
<p>Soon, they had an answer to their doubts. This was because Imperial Lord Behemoth had really begun digging the tree. Its huge and sharp claws grabbed at the roots of the golden fruit tree.</p>
<p>With a clang, Imperial Lord Behemoth’s powerful claws only left a white mark on the tree root. It couldn’t even be considered damage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised as he ordered Imperial Lord Behemoth to dig up the soil beside the tree root. Although it wasn’t deep, there were obvious results. It dug out a little soil.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, he’s really going to uproot the golden fruit tree!”</p>
<p>“What a ruthless person. Others only pluck apples, but he doesn’t even spare the tree. What’s the difference between that and digging up someone’s ancestral grave?” “Too ruthless… But I like it…”</p>
<p>Everyone discussed spiritedly as their attention was on the digging Imperial Lord Behemoth. They wanted to know if Imperial Lord Behemoth could dig out the golden fruit tree.</p>
<p>No one paid attention to Zhou Wen who was gaming on his phone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the mysterious phone and kept paying attention to the download progress. Getting Imperial Lord Behemoth to dig up the tree was only to divert the attention of others. He didn’t believe that digging up the tree could really clear the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>The phone kept showing the download progress. Zhou Wen didn’t know when it would finish. All he could do was act calm as he watched Imperial Lord Behemoth dig the tree.</p>
<p>He didn’t wish for Imperial Lord Behemoth to dig too quickly. He didn’t know what to do next if it really dug out the tree. Before using his phone to figure out the dimensional zone’s situation, Zhou Wen didn’t dare proceed further.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the soil beneath the golden fruit tree was terrifyingly hard. The Calamity-grade Imperial Lord Behemoth was good at strength, but it could only dig out a small amount of soil every time. According to this, it would probably take at least half a day to dig out the golden fruit tree.</p>
<p>Time ticked by. Everyone kept staring at the scene, but after more than two hours passing, the scene remained fixed on Imperial Lord Behemoth’s tree digging. Many people became sleepy.</p>
<p>“I can’t take it anymore. I’ll go take a nap. Wake me up when he’s done digging.”</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, it will take at least a few hours to dig out the tree. I’ll sleep for a while too.”</p>
<p>Many people went to bed. After watching so many human challenges and digging for so long, it would be strange if they weren’t sleepy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also burning with anxiety. The download was still stuck at the progress screen despite downloading for so long.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen heard a clang. It sounded like a metal clang. He was immediately given a fright as he hurriedly looked at Imperial Lord Behemoth.</p>
<p>With a glance, he discovered something amiss.</p>
<p>Imperial Lord Behemoth had dug half a meter deep into the soil beneath the tree, revealing a black object that was completely different in color from the soil.</p>
<p>The metal clang was produced when Imperial Lord Behemoth’s claws touched the black object.</p>
<p>The spectators were also attracted by the loud clang. They also saw the black object and were puzzled as to what it was.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully observed it for a while and could only tell that it looked like metal or stone. Only a small portion was exposed, and most of it was still buried in the soil.</p>
<p>Seeing that the thing didn’t seem to pose any threat, Zhou Wen ordered Imperial Lord Behemoth to continue digging around the black object.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Zhou Wen didn’t wish to dig out the black object, but the hardness of the object wasn’t inferior to the golden fruit tree. Imperial Lord Behemoth’s claws couldn’t leave any marks on it, so it was impossible for it to dig it up.</p>
<p>The black object was bigger than Zhou Wen imagined. Imperial Lord Behemoth dug further past the black object, revealing its ever-increasing size as it dug. There was no end to the digging.</p>
<p>After digging for several hours, it didn’t manage to dig all the way to the edge. Instead, it dug out the surroundings of the golden fruit tree. Now, people could clearly see that the golden fruit tree was rooted in the black object. It was impossible to dig it out unless the black object was shattered. “From the looks of it, it’s impossible to uproot the golden fruit tree.” The spectators also saw Zhou Wen’s predicament as they waited for his next move.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1768'>Chapter 1768 Three-Eyed Gods</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the black object below and frowned slightly. Before he could do anything, the Demonic Sword in Demonic Neonate’s arms automatically flew out again.</p>
<p>The tiny Demonic Sword charged straight at the roots of the golden fruit tree and plunged in with a plop.</p>
<p>The Demonic Sword penetrated the hard golden fruit tree as it charged in like a drill and vanished in the blink of an eye. There was only a cracking sound coming from the hole as well as spewing powder.</p>
<p>When did the Demonic Sword’s offensive strength become so strong? Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>When Demonic Neonate first obtained the Demonic Sword, the Demonic Sword’s strength wasn’t that powerful. It now had such powerful strength. The golden fruit tree that even the Calamity-grade Imperial Lord Behemoth couldn’t damage was easily penetrated by the Demonic Sword. This was just the Demonic Sword’s strength, not Demonic Neonate’s strength augmenting it.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the power of the Demonic Sword can grow with Demonic Neonate’s growth. Zhou Wen was very envious of Demonic Neonate’s ability.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was only envious, but the spectators were already shocked speechless. The destructive power displayed by the Demonic Sword was unbelievable.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Before long, there was a loud boom. The golden fruit tree that was rooted in the black matter began to crack from its roots. The entire tree collapsed and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>After the golden fruit tree collapsed, a pitch-black hole appeared where it originally was. It led straight down, but there was no end in sight. It was pitch-black like a bottomless abyss.</p>
<p>Could it be that I found the key to this dimensional zone by chance? Zhou Wen was alarmed. He had dug the tree to stall for time, but to his surprise, he had discovered something</p>
<p>“So there’s a whole different world beneath the golden fruit tree. Zhou Wen’s digging of the tree really has a deeper meaning. Professor Gu, what do you think will be inside the hole?” Su Yi completely misunderstood Zhou Wen’s intentions, but her view was shared by most people. Everyone believed that Zhou Wen had long determined the existence of the underground cave.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Everything is unknown,” Professor Gu said with a heavy expression. “If we had those alien races as a reference during the earlier attempts, everything that Zhou Wen is encountering now is unknown. The difficulty is completely different from before. I only hope that he can return safely.”</p>
<p>Many people watching the program stared nervously at the scene. Just as Professor Gu had said, every step Zhou Wen took was a challenge of the unknown. It was even more nerve-racking than the battles with expected outcomes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at the hole and didn’t plan on entering. He was just stalling for time. He had to wait for the download of the phone dungeon to be completed.</p>
<p>He didn’t move, but Demonic Neonate moved. She jumped into the bottomless abyss. Zhou Wen was alarmed but it was too late to summon her back.</p>
<p>After Demonic Neonate jumped into the hole, her connection with him was immediately severed. He could only sense Demonic Neonate’s existence, but she couldn’t transmit any information.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen summoned Imperial Lord Behemoth and jumped in.</p>
<p>With his understanding of Demonic Neonate, she probably wouldn’t be stupid enough to send herself to her death. There might not be the imagined danger down there.</p>
<p>“That punk… He’s a brainless boor…” An Tianzuo nearly exploded from anger. It was equivalent to tempting fate by not doing the most basic reconnaissance or probes before jumping in.</p>
<p>An Sheng didn’t dare say a word. He didn’t know how to explain Zhou Wen’s actions which were simply too rash.</p>
<p>“Sigh, he’s still too young. He was blinded by his previous successes. He didn’t even do the basic reconnaissance work and jumped in just like that.” Professor Gu couldn’t help but sigh and shake his head.</p>
<p>This time, even many of Professor Gu’s haters felt that what he said made sense. It looked like Zhou Wen had made a very rash choice.</p>
<p>How could they know that Zhou Wen had no choice? He couldn’t let Demonic Neonate take the risk herself.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen jumped into the hole, the Cube’s screen plunged into darkness. It lasted for a long time before it suddenly lit up.</p>
<p>As the light was too blinding, people’s eyes couldn’t immediately adapt to it. All they felt was a blinding light in front of them, preventing them from seeing anything. It took a while for their eyes to gradually adapt to the dazzling light before they gradually saw the scene clearly.</p>
<p>The scene that entered their vision was shocking. It was a huge palace that was many times bigger than a human palace. Every pillar was a thousand feet tall and the various artifacts were shockingly large. Even the steps in the palace were more than ten meters tall.</p>
<p>At the end of the stairs was a throne that was nearly a hundred meters tall. On it was a humanoid creature wrapped in golden armor.</p>
<p>The creature looked like a human, but its body was far bigger than a human’s.</p>
<p>In front of this huge palace and creature, Zhou Wen and Demonic Neonate were as tiny as ants. Even the humans watching the battle through the livestream couldn’t help but feel extremely tiny.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the golden giant on the throne opened its eyes. Its eyes were blue like the sea, and on its forehead was a vertical eye with a golden pupil. Its three eyes stared coldly at Zhou Wen and Demonic Neonate like a god was looking down at mortals.</p>
<p>The average person felt that the golden-armored giant’s aura was shocking, like a god or devil. However, the dimensional powerhouses watching the battle were alarmed and nearly cried out.</p>
<p>“Three-Eyed Gods!” Trajectory Seeking’s composure was clearly inferior to those old monsters as she blurted out.</p>
<p>“What Three-Eyed Gods?” Li Xuan asked her.</p>
<p>“That’s the legendary Gods that vanished overnight. That golden vertical eye is the proof of the Gods’ noble bloodline. I never expected the Gods to still remain… There are even pure-blooded Gods that live in this world…” Trajectory Seeking continued with a complicated expression, “Zhou Wen probably won’t be able to return.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing impressive about the races in the dimension. It’s not like Old Zhou hasn’t killed one before. What’s so impressive about the Gods?” Li Xuan curled his lips.</p>
<p>“What do you know? Having a golden vertical eye represents the noblest bloodline of the Gods. They are born powerhouses and possess unparalleled strength. They are extremely rare existences among the Gods. They are existences that can fight many of the strongest alien races. How can a mere human fight them? Zhou Wen is dead,” Trajectory Seeking said with certainty.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you want to say that that thing is at the Apocalypse grade?” Li Xuan asked with a trembling voice.</p>
<p>“It’s not just the Apocalypse grade. Even among the Apocalypse-grade creatures, the Three-Eyed Gods are the strongest existences. Back then, it was an existence that could fight the Immortals at their peak…” Trajectory Seeking sighed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1769'>Chapter 1769 The Abnormal Demonic Neonate</h3>
<p>“There are indeed survivors from the Three-Eyed Gods.” Holy Lord Trajectory wasn’t too surprised to see the Three-Eyed Gods.</p>
<p>Even the powerful Immortals didn’t have the ability to destroy the Gods along with their divine mountain back then; therefore, there was definitely something amiss.</p>
<p>However, after so many years, no one could figure out the truth.</p>
<p>Now that a golden Three-Eyed God had appeared, Holy Lord Trajectory wanted to use this opportunity to understand the truth behind the disappearance of the Gods.</p>
<p>The other alien factions had the same thoughts as they paid attention to the Cube’s screen.</p>
<p>However, from their point of view, a mere human was doomed. It was impossible for him to cause much of a stir in front of the Three-Eyed God that possessed a golden vertical eye.</p>
<p>The only thing they were interested in was how the Three-Eyed God would kill Zhou Wen. From this, they could tell how much strength the Three-Eyed God retained.</p>
<p>The moment Zhou Wen saw the Three-Eyed God, he felt like he was a father being tricked by his child. His first thought was to immediately escape, but the temple seemed to imprison him with some special power. He couldn’t use spatial skills to leave.</p>
<p>It wasn’t an ordinary taboo rule. Otherwise, the Teacher Domain would definitely be able to crack it.</p>
<p>According to Zhou Wen’s experience, that power was likely a very pure power. It was so pure that other power determinants couldn’t exist in it. Therefore, in such a pure power domain, no ability could be used unless one’s power broke through the purity of this power.</p>
<p>Neonate, oh Neonate, you really screwed me over this time. Zhou Wen attempted to retreat – his body wasn’t restrained.</p>
<p>The omnipresent pure power that filled the entire temple suppressed all abilities, but it didn’t affect Zhou Wen’s body at all. Even Zhou Wen marveled at this strange characteristic.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t have the time to study this now. All he wanted to do was stay as far away from the Three-Eyed God as possible. Even if he couldn’t leave the temple, it was better to stay away from him.</p>
<p>The aura emitted by the Three-Eyed God made him feel extreme danger. Although he couldn’t determine the exact level of the Three-Eyed God, Zhou Wen had a strong feeling that he was an Apocalypse-grade existence.</p>
<p>He reached out to grab Demonic Neonate’s tiny hand and wanted to pull her back with him, but Demonic Neonate had no intention of retreating at all. She stood there without moving as she stared at the Three-Eyed God.</p>
<p>Under everyone’s gaze, the Three-Eyed God slowly stood up.</p>
<p>He originally sat there with an extremely oppressive aura, but after standing up, the aura became even more terrifying. Even just watching from the livestream screen made him feel like a godking who controlled everything. It was as though a casual glance from him could kill all life.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart was in his throat, but despite pulling hard, Demonic Neonate remained motionless as she continued looking at the Three-Eyed God.</p>
<p>Has this child… gone silly… That shouldn’t be the case… Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>No one knew Demonic Neonate’s personality better than Zhou Wen. She liked to hide in the shadows and sneak an attack. How could she not weigh the pros and cons and insist on standing there waiting for death? Could it be that Demonic Neonate has a plan? Zhou Wen looked at the Three-Eyed God who was slowly walking down the stairs. He gritted his teeth and stood there motionless.</p>
<p>Neonate, oh Neonate, don’t screw me over. Zhou Wen knew that even if he didn’t hide his strength, he only had a 1% chance of survival in a head-on battle with the Three-Eyed God.</p>
<p>This 1% chance was only thanks to Sigh of the King, not because his strength was enough to survive.</p>
<p>I should have known that something would happen every time I enter a true dimensional zone. I shouldn’t have come. Zhou Wen sighed inwardly, but he could only wait for a miracle to happen.</p>
<p>Is a mere human worthy of having such a noble God get up to kill him? Could it be that the power of the Three-Eyed God has already weakened to such an extent? Holy Lord Trajectory frowned slightly.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just him. Basically, the alien powerhouses who knew of the Gods’ former glory believed that it was beneath the Three-Eyed God to get up and walk down the stairs.</p>
<p>Golden Three-Eyed Gods were at the peak of the Apocalypse grade. They could kill creatures below the Apocalypse grade without even moving their fingers. Even if there were thousands of creatures below the Apocalypse grade, they would be reduced to ashes with a mere thought.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the golden Three-Eyed God get up and walk down, the alien powerhouses basically believed that his strength had weakened tremendously. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to do such a thing.</p>
<p>Ordinary humans didn’t know how terrifying the golden Three-Eyed God was as they discussed how Zhou Wen was going to kill him.</p>
<p>“I wonder if the City Lord will personally take action this time… Or will he let that adorable Companion Beast kill the golden giant…” In front of Guide City’s Cube, many people were discussing this problem. Clearly, they were very confident in Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>If three of his students could easily enter the rankings, how bad could Zhou Wen be as their teacher?</p>
<p>“Ignorant humans, Zhou Wen is dead,” Trajectory Seeking said with a cold snort.</p>
<p>She wasn’t convinced about Zhou Wen despite taking him as her master. She refused to address him as ‘Teacher.’ However, her words came from the bottom of her heart.</p>
<p>“Young lady, don’t think that the giant is very strong just because he’s tall and mighty. Among the monsters our City Lord Zhou has killed, there are many who are much bigger than him. There’s nothing impressive about him. It will probably only take two or three strikes,” an elder beside her informed Trajectory Seeking with a smile.</p>
<p>“Two to three strikes? I don’t think there’s a need for that,” Trajectory Seeking said with a sneer.</p>
<p>“True. Our City Lord Zhou is a godlike figure. A single strike should be enough for such a giant. At most, two strikes,” the elder said with a chuckle, believing that Trajectory Seeking agreed with him.</p>
<p>Many citizens beside him echoed, feeling that the elder was right.</p>
<p>Most ordinary people in Guide City treated Zhou Wen as a god. In their hearts, Zhou Wen was an invincible existence. Killing the giant would be easy.</p>
<p>Keep laughing. Let’s see if you can still laugh when you see Zhou Wen smacked to death later. Trajectory Seeking couldn’t be bothered to argue with such ignorant citizens as she thought disdainfully.</p>
<p>“Is that three-eyed giant very strong?” Li Xuan wasn’t an ordinary person. He could naturally sense that the Three-Eyed God was very strong, so he asked Trajectory Seeking worriedly.</p>
<p>“Strong? You can be a little more confident and use an affirmative tone.” Trajectory Seeking finally grasped an opportunity and said immediately, “The golden Three-Eyed Gods at their peak were unparalleled and powerful existences in the dimension. They were almost synonymous with invincibility…”</p>
<p>As Trajectory Seeking spoke, her voice suddenly came to a halt. Her eyes, which were still glued to the Cube’s screen, gradually widened. Even at her limits, they were still expanding. Her eye sockets almost failed to contain her eyeballs.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1770'>Chapter 1770 Covenant of God</h3>
<p>The golden Three-Eyed God slowly walked down the stairs and arrived in front of Zhou Wen and Demonic Neonate. At the same time, he pressed down with his palm.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat as he had the urge to draw his sword. However, Demonic Neonate’s tiny hand tugged at him slightly as though telling him not to be nervous.</p>
<p>I’ll believe you this once. Don’t screw me over, Neonate! Zhou Wen held back the urge to draw his sword and thought to himself.</p>
<p>The spectators watched as the golden Three-Eyed God pressed down with his palm, but Zhou Wen didn’t move. Their hearts immediately rose to their throats.</p>
<p>However, to everyone’s surprise, the golden Three-Eyed God’s palm didn’t strike Zhou Wen and Demonic Neonate. Instead, it extended in front of them.</p>
<p>The way the golden Three-Eyed God bent down and extended his hand didn’t look like a provocation. Instead, it looked like a human male inviting a lady to dance.</p>
<p>This action was somewhat strange to humans, but to the alien big shots who knew the Gods well, they were already dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Trajectory Seeking’s eyes widened as though she had seen a ghost.</p>
<p>She naturally knew that this action wasn’t an invitation to dance, but it was also an invitation etiquette. It was also a ritual unique to the Gods.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still looking at the terrifying creature in front of him, unsure what he meant. Just as he was pondering over it, Demonic Neonate pulled his hand slightly, gesturing for him to raise his hand and meet the palm of the golden Three-Eyed God.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that Demonic Neonate wouldn’t harm him. He hesitated for a moment before taking the initiative to extend his hand to meet the golden Three-Eyed God’s huge palm.</p>
<p>When the golden Three-Eyed God saw Zhou Wen extend his hand, a strange glint flashed in his eyes. However, it only lasted a moment. His actions didn’t change, nor did his palm move.</p>
<p>Finally, Zhou Wen pressed his palm on the hand of the golden Three-Eyed God, or rather, on the tip of one of his fingers. The Three-Eyed God was just too big. A finger was much bigger than Zhou Wen’s palm.</p>
<p>At the instant the two palms touched, the golden Three-Eyed God emitted a strange golden divine light that wrapped around Zhou Wen’s palm like countless golden threads.</p>
<p>Instantly, golden divine light shone brightly, causing the entire screen to be filled with golden light. It was almost impossible to see the scene inside.</p>
<p>“Covenant of God… The golden Three-Eyed God… and a human… How is this possible…” Trajectory Seeking stared blankly at the dazzling golden scene. Her brain couldn’t function anymore.</p>
<p>The Gods were a very ancient race in the dimension. They were also a unique existence among many strange lifeforms.</p>
<p>Gods were born with peak strength. They weren’t like ordinary alien races that could continue raising their strength.</p>
<p>The only way for Gods to continue raising their strength was through the Covenant of God. This was a ritual or contract that only Gods could use.</p>
<p>The other races in the dimension couldn’t use the Covenant of God, not because it was profound, but because the Covenant of God required the special physiques of a God to be of use. Without the special physiques of the Gods, the Covenant of God couldn’t be reached.</p>
<p>The physique of the Gods was originally that of the three-eyed giant, but once the Covenant of God was made, a God’s body would undergo a strange change.</p>
<p>Amidst the golden light, the body of the golden Three-Eyed God gradually changed. In a moment, he no longer looked human. Furthermore, his body was rapidly shrinking.</p>
<p>Soon, the golden Three-Eyed God vanished. Only a very special golden trident remained in Zhou Wen’s palm.</p>
<p>The golden trident was somewhat similar to a Heaven Scorcher Halberd. It was completely made of gold, and at the point of contact, there was a golden gem that resembled an eye.</p>
<p>The trident was covered in mysterious and strange patterns that shimmered with a soul-stirring glow, as though it was a divine artifact used by gods.</p>
<p>No, it should be said that this was a divine artifact, a weapon formed by a God.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the golden trident and felt the majestic power that resembled an endless sea of stars inside. He was stunned.</p>
<p>The golden trident’s strength was just too powerful. It was so powerful that Zhou Wen felt that his strength was trivial.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the golden Three-Eyed God that had transformed into the golden trident was an Apocalypse-grade existence. Such a powerful existence had actually taken the initiative to transform into his weapon.</p>
<p>Or rather, he had taken the initiative to transform into Demonic Neonate’s weapon. This left Zhou Wen in disbelief. He had already overestimated Demonic Neonate’s origins, but now, he had no choice but to reevaluate her origins.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could tell that the golden Three-Eyed God had originally chosen Demonic Neonate. It was only because of Demonic Neonate’s choice that the golden Three-Eyed God ultimately made a covenant with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could tell, but others couldn’t. Everyone only saw the golden giant take the initiative to transform into Zhou Wen’s weapon. Many people exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Young lady, what did I say? Our City Lord Zhou is a godlike figure. That giant knows how powerful City Lord Zhou is and took the initiative to acknowledge him as his master, turning him into our City Lord Zhou’s weapon…” The elder who had spoken to Trajectory Seeking previously wore a look as though it was only right. It was as though the golden Three-Eyed God was poor in acumen if he hadn’t acknowledged Zhou Wen as his master.</p>
<p>Trajectory Seeking was rendered speechless. She didn’t know how to refute. She didn’t even have the mood to refute. At this moment, she hadn’t recovered from her shock.</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn’t just Trajectory Seeking. The experts of the six Holy races, the Immortals, the Ghosts, and the Spirits were dumbfounded. They couldn’t recover from their shock for a long time.</p>
<p>When the Gods were at their peak, the Covenant of God had also been used, but most of them were low-level gods who used the Covenant of God to form a covenant with other alien races.</p>
<p>Gods were divided into green, blue, white, and gold levels according to the color of the vertical eye. The green-eyed Gods were the weakest, but they were also born at the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>The white-eyed Gods were born at the Apocalypse grade, so it was almost impossible for them to form an alliance with other races, much less the strongest golden Three-Eyed Gods.</p>
<p>Typically, the Gods that formed a covenant with other races were mostly green-eyed and blue-eyed Gods. Even so, once a green-eyed God was willing to form a covenant with the other races, they would be in high demand.</p>
<p>If one wasn’t an Apocalypse-grade big shot, it was very rare for them to obtain the favor of the green-eyed God.</p>
<p>The Apocalypse-grade big shots were naturally not fools. The Calamity-grade green-eyed Gods were useless to them, but after using the Covenant of God, they became weapons that could grow. Furthermore, they were weapons with high intelligence. They were incomparable to ordinary weapons.</p>
<p>Now, a human youth had actually been acknowledged by the golden Three-Eyed God and formed the Covenant of God, becoming a weapon for the human youth. How could they not be surprised?</p>
<p>Throughout the history of the Gods, such a thing was virtually unprecedented.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1771'>Chapter 1771 Gods’ New Sovereign</h3>
<p>My dear baby Neonate, I really didn’t dote on you for nothing… Zhou Wen wished he could hug Demonic Neonate and kiss her twice. Just as he was secretly delighted, he suddenly felt the golden trident in his hand tremble.</p>
<p>The golden gem on the golden trident suffused a strange glow as the tip of the trident automatically pointed in the direction of the throne.</p>
<p>Is it trying to get me to ascend the throne? Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he walked towards the throne with Demonic Neonate in one hand and the trident in the other.</p>
<p>The Cube’s livestream continued as the Earth and the dimension paid attention to Zhou Wen’s every move.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen arrived in front of the throne and leaped up, the huge temple suddenly trembled violently.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also wanted to sit on the throne to appear more imposing, but unfortunately, the throne was just too huge. He would only look ridiculous if he really sat on it.</p>
<p>As the temple trembled, the Cube’s screen slowly zoomed out. The temple became smaller and smaller on the screen before the scene returned to the golden fruit tree that had been sliced apart. Then, it continued pulling away, allowing people to oversee the entire island.</p>
<p>The entire island was trembling violently as though there was an earthquake. The surrounding lake water surged, forming waves that constantly smashed into the island.</p>
<p>As for the island itself, it started floating. Huge cracks appeared over the island, as though it would crumble at any moment.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Just as people were worried, the island began to crumble. Rubble kept peeling off from the rising island and plunged into the lake.</p>
<p>The island rose higher and higher as the crumbling intensified, but the speed at which it crumbled wasn’t as fast as it rose. The island stood like a mountain peak above the lake as many collapsed spots revealed the black object Zhou Wen had dug out.</p>
<p>When the rocks outside had completely peeled off, people finally saw the true appearance of the island. Or rather, it wasn’t an island at all, but a black mountain.</p>
<p>The entire lake was filled with rocks that fell from the mountain. The lake stirred as the mountain rose higher and higher, becoming more and more majestic. It tore through the clouds and looked down at the endless sea of clouds.</p>
<p>At the peak of the mountain, a huge palace slowly appeared.</p>
<p>“The Gods’ divine mountain that went missing…” Trajectory Seeking was stunned by this series of changes. She only stared at the black divine mountain in a daze.</p>
<p>The mountain tore through layers of clouds and rose to an unknown height. It stood high above the clouds. The huge and mysterious palace emitted a strange gentle glow, like a soul palace that was independent of the world.</p>
<p>When the divine mountain stopped trembling, the Cube’s screen zoomed back at the divine mountain from a closer angle.</p>
<p>At that moment, people saw huge figures appear above the divine mountain as though they had drilled out of the ground.</p>
<p>Soon, people could clearly see that the huge figures were three-eyed giants.</p>
<p>Although the new three-eyed giants weren’t as tall as the golden three-eyed giant from before, they were still more than a hundred meters tall.</p>
<p>However, their vertical eyes were mostly green and blue. Only a very small number of them were silver in color.</p>
<p>Golden vertical eyes like the golden three-eyed giant’s were nowhere to be seen on them.</p>
<p>More and more huge figures appeared, soon covering the divine mountain with countless numbers.</p>
<p>The towering divine mountain couldn’t accommodate the large number of gigantic figures. Most green-eyed Gods appeared at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>After an unknown period of time, huge figures covered the top and bottom of the divine mountain.</p>
<p>The square in front of the temple was filled with white-eyed Gods.</p>
<p>Just as everyone was reeling in shock, countless three-eyed giants suddenly genuflected in the direction of the temple. They placed a hand on their chests and lowered their heads as they shouted in unison, “Your arrival is welcomed, unparalleled new king.”</p>
<p>The shouts shook the world. The entire dimension could hear the awe-inspiring sounds.</p>
<p>The expressions of the experts from the various races in the dimension changed. As for most of the humans, they were pleasantly surprised and even euphoric.</p>
<p>A human was actually treated as a king in the dimension. How glorious was that?</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen, everyone believed that the races in the dimension were lifeforms that transcended humanity. It was impossible for humans to be mentioned in the same breath as them. They should be grateful for any favor they received.</p>
<p>However, what Zhou Wen had done today completely overturned the average person’s understanding.</p>
<p>They suddenly realized that not only could humans be recipients of resources donated by the races of the dimension, but they could also become supreme existences that were worshiped by countless powerful dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>When had a human ever received such treatment? The spectating humans were stunned.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the humans who were stunned. Even the various dimensional bigwigs were stunned.</p>
<p>That was the invincible race of Gods, a race that had once almost reached the apex of the dimension. Yet, they actually acknowledged a human as their new sovereign. This was something they didn’t dare imagine.</p>
<p>“Long live our sovereign… Long live the Gods…” The thousands of Gods on the divine mountain shouted in unison, their voices reverberating across the dimension.</p>
<p>With shouts that shook the world, the Cube’s screen changed again and switched to the Cube’s ranking.</p>
<p>Without any suspense, first place changed to two simple words—”Zhou Wen.”</p>
<p>These two extremely simple words and the simple name shocked the human world and the dimension in that instant.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in a good mood.</p>
<p>He was indeed very happy when the myriad Gods worshiped him.</p>
<p>However, after the worship ended, the Gods that covered the mountain vanished like they had been dusted. In the blink of an eye, only Zhou Wen and Demonic Neonate remained on the entire divine mountain with the golden trident in hand.</p>
<p>What a scam! Only then did Zhou Wen react and let out a wail.</p>
<p>The Gods that filled the mountain just now weren’t real Gods at all. They were just illusions condensed from unyielding wills.</p>
<p>When the new king of the Gods appeared, the unyielding will finally earned liberation and completely dissipated.</p>
<p>They were liberated in satisfaction, but now that the entire world knew that Zhou Wen had become the new king of the Gods, wouldn’t he have to face the wrath of the entire dimension? Sadly, he was a commander without an army.</p>
<p>A human had become the king of the Gods, and the Gods had once been one of the strongest races in the dimension. How could the old fellows in the dimension tolerate this?</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen only wanted to know if he could leave the divine mountain and return to Earth.</p>
<p>However, the outcome chilled Zhou Wen’s heart. The Cube’s challenge had already ended, but he wasn’t teleported back to Earth. Instead, he remained in the temple.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1772'>Chapter 1772 Grim Demon’s Story</h3>
<p>On the divine mountain, Zhou Wen got Demonic Neonate to summon Grim Demon as he asked with a smile, “Grim Demon, how have I treated you all this while?”</p>
<p>“Not… bad…” Grim Demon stammered, but he cursed inwardly. You still have the nerve to ask how you’ve treated me? Don’t you know how you’ve been treating me?</p>
<p>“It’s just not bad?” Zhou Wen said with a sullen expression.</p>
<p>Grim Demon was alarmed as he hurriedly forced a smile and said, “Not only is it not bad, but it’s really good. It’s so good that I’m speechless. It’s like having a second parent.”</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen nod in satisfaction. “Since you know that I’m really good to you, it’s time for you to do something.”</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Grim Demon looked at Zhou Wen warily.</p>
<p>“Take a look at this place first,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“This is… the divine mountain of the Gods…” After Grim Demon carefully looked around, his expression changed drastically. “Why did you bring Master to such a place… Don’t you know…”</p>
<p>Halfway through his sentence, Grim Demon seemed to realize something and suddenly shut up.</p>
<p>“What don’t I know?” Zhou Wen looked at Grim Demon and said slowly.</p>
<p>“Nothing.” Grim Demon shut up, clearly unwilling to reveal anything more related to Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>“You can choose not to say anything, but it’s best you figure out what’s going on.” Zhou Wen raised the golden trident in his hand in front of Grim Demon and continued, “This is the only surviving God on the divine mountain. And now, he has become my weapon. As for me, I’ve been left on this divine mountain by the Cube. I can’t return to Earth. I think you know what will happen next better than me.”</p>
<p>“What did you say? This is a weapon formed by a golden God. Would a golden God choose to become your weapon?” Grim Demon wore a look of disbelief.</p>
<p>“Of course, he became my weapon partially thanks to Neonate,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by partially thanks to Master? I think it’s clearly all thanks to Master,” Grim Demon immediately corrected.</p>
<p>“No matter who contributed, I’m now the wielder of this weapon. Furthermore, I’m now stuck in the dimension. Neonate naturally has to stay here. Now, the entire dimension knows that I’ve become the owner of the divine mountain and possess this golden weapon.”</p>
<p>“Fool, didn’t I tell you not to expose Master’s existence? How can you take her to participate in the Cube battle…” Grim Demon cursed in exasperation.</p>
<p>“Apart from that, do you have anything else to say? If not, wait to die with your master,” Zhou Wen interrupted Grim Demon and said expressionlessly.</p>
<p>Grim Demon immediately fell silent as his expression changed for a while before he sighed and said, “You’ve gotten it wrong. Even if I tell you everything about Master, it will still be useless for your current situation. It might even be more dangerous. If you expose Master because of this, I can only say that you are really stupid.”</p>
<p>“If you don’t tell me, how do you know that it won’t help me?” Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush as he said casually.</p>
<p>“Alright, actually, what I know isn’t bad, but there’s something I can tell you with certainty. The reason the divine mountain and the Gods vanished overnight has a lot to do with Master,” Grim Demon said helplessly.</p>
<p>“Continue.” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be delighted when he saw Grim Demon finally relent.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had grown increasingly curious about Demonic Neonate’s origins. However, there were too few people who knew her origins. Grim Demon was definitely the one who knew most about the truth, but he was too tight-lipped. Even if Zhou Wen threatened him with his life, Grim Demon refused to say a word. It was rare for him to be willing to say anything about Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>Grim Demon wore a conflicted expression. After a while, he said, “I’ll tell you a story.”</p>
<p>“I’m all ears,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>“In the past, there was a hunter who hunted every day for survival. One day, when he was hunting, he saw a wolf biting a rabbit. As for the rabbit, it was a mother who had just given birth. In its nest, there were a few kits who were clamoring for food. When the kits saw their mother by the nest, they crawled out of their nests, hoping to be breastfed, but they couldn’t understand that not only was their mother in danger, but even they themselves would become food for the hungry wolf.” With that said, Grim Demon stared at Zhou Wen and asked, “If you were the hunter, what would you do?”</p>
<p>“Kill that wolf and save the rabbit and its kits,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“Alright, if the hunter saves the rabbit and its children, that wolf will go hungry, and it might also be the mother of a few wolf cubs. Without food, it and its children will starve to death. If you know this, will you still save the rabbit and those kits?” Grim Demon asked again.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Zhou Wen answered without any hesitation.</p>
<p>This was an unsolvable problem to begin with. From different angles, be it whether Zhou Wen saved them or not, it was wrong. Therefore, he didn’t need to think too much. All he needed to do was be himself.</p>
<p>“Very good. You saved that rabbit and its kits. The wolf was killed by you, and the wolf cubs starved to death. After that, the rabbits no longer had any natural enemies. They constantly reproduced and their numbers constantly increased. The resources originally available were no longer able to satisfy the rabbits’ appetite. They couldn’t fill their stomachs, so the rabbits would group up and eat the crops you planted, causing the crops you planted to be wiped out by harvest time. You wouldn’t have any food to pass the winter. What would you choose?” Grim Demon continued posing difficult questions to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“In that case, I made the wrong choice from the beginning. I shouldn’t have saved that rabbit.” Zhou Wen wasn’t usually a stubborn person. Although he could come up with reasons to refute Grim Demon, he didn’t do so. Instead, he changed his train of thought.</p>
<p>“Alright, if you don’t save the rabbits, the wolf will have plenty of food after hunting the rabbits. The wolf cubs will quickly grow and give birth to more wolves. When that happens, the entire mountain will be filled with wolves. Ignoring hunting in the mountains, even living in the mountains will be very dangerous. Perhaps the wolf pack will rush into your house and tear you apart for food. Is this the outcome you want?” Grim Demon sneered.</p>
<p>If it were an ordinary person, they would only blame Grim Demon for coming up with unsolvable problems. However, Zhou Wen didn’t think so. After some thought, he said, “I can tame that wolf. At the same time, with the help of the wolf, I can hunt a certain number of rabbits and maintain the number of rabbits within a certain range. This way, the rabbits will not overbreed and the wolves won’t be a threat to me.”</p>
<p>Only then did Grim Demon nod as though he was pleased with his answer. “I hope you can make the same choice when you encounter the same thing in the future and not act on impulse.”</p>
<p>“And then?” Zhou Wen didn’t wish to discuss this with Grim Demon. All he wanted to know was what Grim Demon’s story had to do with Demonic Neonate.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1773'>Chapter 1773 White Jade Pillar</h3>
<p>“Eventually, someone saved the rabbits and reared the wolf. From then on, the world was beautiful,” Grim Demon said sarcastically.</p>
<p>“That’s it?” Zhou Wen felt that the story wasn’t over.</p>
<p>“Of course not. A wolf is ultimately a wolf, not a dog, but that’s not the most terrifying thing. Sometimes, rabbits might not really be rabbits. That’s what’s most terrifying,” Grim Demon said with a sneer.</p>
<p>“It’s best if you finish your story.” Zhou Wen had roughly noticed something.</p>
<p>“I’m done. You should be able to guess what will happen next,” Grim Demon said as he glanced at Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>“Who’s the rabbit?” Zhou Wen had guessed that the Gods were likely the wolf. As for Demonic Neonate, or rather, a race that Demonic Neonate represented, they were hunters. As for the rabbit, Zhou Wen wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” Grim Demon asked.</p>
<p>“Immortals?” Zhou Wen guessed, but he wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>“They look as cute as rabbits, but in fact, they are even more terrifying than wolves.” Grim Demon didn’t say it out loud, but it was already considered tacit agreement.</p>
<p>After a pause, Grim Demon continued, “Now, you should understand why I repeatedly emphasized that we mustn’t let Master be exposed, right?” “I understand, but she’s already exposed. Furthermore, I’m still trapped in the dimension and can’t leave. Do you think the Immortals will come here?” Zhou Wen probed.</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn’t that he didn’t have the ability to leave the dimension. If the Cube didn’t send him back, he could return himself.</p>
<p>Others might not be able to do it, but Zhou Wen, who had the Mystic Thearch Companion Beast, could easily break through the spatial barrier. It wasn’t difficult to return. He only wanted to obtain more information regarding Demonic Neonate from Grim Demon.</p>
<p>Now, he finally knew Demonic Neonate’s origins. It was even bigger than Zhou Wen had imagined. Demonic Neonate or the race that Demonic Neonate belonged to was originally an existence that could suppress the Immortals and Gods.</p>
<p>“Perhaps, perhaps not. The Immortals are no longer the original Immortals. That rebellious Immortal is no longer in the world. With what Master has become, perhaps no Immortal can recognize her,” Grim Demon said after some thought. “However, it’s best you leave immediately. It’s better to be safe than sorry.”</p>
<p>“Do you think this thing can fight an Immortal powerhouse?” Zhou Wen said as he shook the golden trident in his hand.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to say. If the traitor from back then is still around, this thing wouldn’t pose any threat to her. Otherwise, the Gods wouldn’t have been in oblivion for so long. If she’s not around, this thing might still be able to scare those fellows,” Grim Demon said.</p>
<p>“Huh?” Zhou Wen frowned slightly.</p>
<p>“What else do you want? Although I’ve been away from the dimension for a long time and don’t know much about the Immortals’ present strength, for them to be capable of suppressing the six Holy races again, it’s impossible for there to be only one person at the Apocalypse grade in the race. You aren’t at the Apocalypse grade yourself. It’s not easy to resist an Apocalypse grade with the help of this thing. Do you want to fight a group alone?” Grim Demon quipped.</p>
<p>“That’s true. In that case, let’s return.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he ignored Grim Demon’s expression and unsummoned Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>As Demonic Neonate’s weapon, Grim Demon was stored away in the Demonic Sword.</p>
<p>Damn bastard, you will be struck by lightning sooner or later. Grim Demon realized that he had been tricked by Zhou Wen as he cursed inwardly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally couldn’t hear his curse. Even if he could hear it, he wouldn’t take it to heart.</p>
<p>Summoning Mystic Thearch to possess him in his soul form, he used the spatial teleportation power of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art and instantly returned to Earth.</p>
<p>Without Mystic Thearch’s power, the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art couldn’t break through the spatial barrier. It could only teleport in the dimension, so it was impossible for him to return to Earth.</p>
<p>Not long after Zhou Wen returned to Earth, a terrifying existence tore through the air and descended on the divine mountain. However, there was only an empty mountain left. The terrifying existence scanned the area for a long time but didn’t discover anything.</p>
<p>If I had known this would happen, I wouldn’t have been so apprehensive. A human punk actually obtained the golden Three-Eyed God. The terrifying existence frowned slightly. He stared at the divine mountain for a moment before turning around and disappearing.</p>
<p>Several extremely terrifying existences descended on the divine mountain in a row, but when they saw the empty divine mountain, no one was interested in staying any longer. They only felt a little regretful.</p>
<p>After a long time, another terrifying creature arrived at the divine mountain. Furthermore, more than one came.</p>
<p>It was a woman who looked like a fairy. The clouds beneath her feet landed on the divine mountain. At the same time, she flicked her sleeve and something flew out.</p>
<p>When the thing flew out of her sleeve, it looked the size of a pellet, but when it landed in front of the temple, it turned into a huge white jade pillar.</p>
<p>The white jade pillar was erected in front of the temple’s door. It was almost as tall as the huge temple as though it was rooted there. And on the white jade pillar, there were black metal chains wrapped around it. Every metal chain passed through a human man’s body and firmly bound him to the white jade pillar.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, you’ve really struck it rich this time. I’m afraid everyone in the Federation knows your name, Zhou Wen,” Li Xuan exclaimed excitedly when he saw Zhou Wen return.</p>
<p>“It’s not like I wanted to be that famous; it’s just that my strength doesn’t allow it,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“You actually took the compliment?” Li Xuan punched Zhou Wen and cursed him in amusement.</p>
<p>“That’s only because I deserve the compliment.” Zhou Wen turned to look at Trajectory Seeking and said, “My dear disciple, do you think I have the right to teach you now?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Trajectory Seeking surprisingly nodded in response. Her attitude was completely different from before.</p>
<p>Back when Zhou Wen repelled the will of Nameless God, Trajectory Seeking could still console herself, believing that it was the influence of Earth’s rules that prevented Nameless God from remotely unleashing his true strength.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was now able to make the golden Three-Eyed God willingly make a Covenant of God. This was a manifestation of absolute strength.</p>
<p>Even an existence like the golden Three-Eyed God was willing to be Zhou Wen’s weapon. There was nothing shameful about her being Zhou Wen’s disciple.</p>
<p>Seeing that Trajectory Seeking’s beliefs had wavered, Zhou Wen was about to say something when he saw the Cube suddenly light up.</p>
<p>Another person is attempting the level? Zhou Wen frowned slightly. He had already taken away something valuable from the Tomb of the Fallen Gods. He didn’t understand why the Cube was continuing the battle. The person clearing the level wasn’t a human, but a strange beast that looked like a lion but was made of bronze.</p>
<p>Unlike before, no scene of the Lake of Fog appeared again. The bronze lion appeared at the foot of the divine mountain.</p>
<p>It moved its four hooves as wind and fire rose beneath its feet. In a moment, it ran to the peak of the divine mountain.</p>
<p>To everyone’s surprise, there were already two people on the empty peak of the divine mountain.</p>
<p>One was a beautiful woman, while the other was an extremely handsome man with dragon horns on his head and white hair that resembled ice threads. The man was tied to a white jade pillar with chains piercing through his sternum. One could feel the pain just looking at him.</p>
<p>“Teacher!” Zhou Wen immediately trembled when he saw the man’s appearance.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1774'>Chapter 1774 Open Trap</h3>
<p>The human man tied to the pillar was none other than Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s first thought was that the Immortals had learned of his joint kill with Wang Mingyuan because the beautiful woman standing beside the pillar looked like an Immortal.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could think further, the Immortal woman struck Wang Mingyuan with her whip. The invisible whip left a new bloody mark on Wang Mingyuan’s tattered clothes.</p>
<p>His crystalline flesh split open as blood seeped into his tattered clothes. It sent a chill deep into one’s heart. Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!</p>
<p>The fairy lashed at Wang Mingyuan again and again, causing more and more bloody wounds to appear on his body. Wang Mingyuan’s expression didn’t change, but Zhou Wen’s expression turned extremely ugly.</p>
<p>The bronze lion that had attempted the level previously roared and charged at the fairy, but it was struck by the fairy. The seemingly powerful bronze beast body was torn apart by the whip. The Cube’s screen also vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression was nasty as he stared at the black Cube’s screen without moving for a long time.</p>
<p>The divine mountain was in the dimension. Apart from entering through the Cube, creatures from the dimension could enter without using the Cube.</p>
<p>The appearance of the fairy and Wang Mingyuan didn’t surprise Zhou Wen, but the meaning behind it made him uneasy.</p>
<p>When the Immortals discovered that Wang Mingyuan had betrayed them, they could have directly executed him or even imprisoned him for torturing</p>
<p>However, now that they had sent Wang Mingyuan to the divine mountain to whip him, allowing everyone to see it through the Cube. It was clearly not as simple as torturing Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen even believed that the Immortals’ goal was to force him to save Wang Mingyuan and take the opportunity to eliminate him.</p>
<p>Knowing of such a possibility was one thing, but Zhou Wen couldn’t stand seeing Wang Mingyuan being treated this way without doing anything</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was thinking about how to save Wang Mingyuan, someone was one step ahead of him.</p>
<p>The Cube lit up again. Someone had launched a new round of attempts. The person attempting the level was Zhong Ziya, who had already appeared once and left his name on the rankings.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t find it strange when he saw Zhong Ziya. He had always been such a person. He appeared arrogant and unyielding, but he was the person who cared the most about his teacher, Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya is indeed the same Zhong Ziya. He has grown up, but his original intention has never changed. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but smile bitterly.</p>
<p>If the Immortals were really targeting him, Zhou Wen, and it was under the condition that they knew that he had obtained the help of the golden Three-Eyed God, they must have made all the necessary preparations on the divine mountain. Or rather, with the Apocalypse-grade holding the fort, Zhong Ziya was probably doomed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen already planned on using spatial teleportation to head to the divine mountain. He couldn’t let Zhong Ziya die for nothing.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, don’t be in a rush to go.” Just as Zhou Wen was about to teleport over, he suddenly heard a familiar voice. Turning his head, he saw Jiang Yan standing not far from the Cube.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan was still as quiet as before. There was nothing different about him. Time didn’t seem to leave any marks on him.</p>
<p>“Zhong Ziya shouldn’t have gone. I…” Zhou Wen wanted to explain, but he was interrupted by Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>“I know what you are getting at. This is an open trap, but it leaves one no choice but to go.” Jiang Yan looked at Zhong Ziya who was walking up the divine mountain and said, “However, I think you should believe Ya. Since he’s gone, he won’t just be throwing himself to his death.”</p>
<p>“The golden Three-Eyed God I obtained is at the Apocalypse grade.” Zhou Wen pointed out the main point. He knew that Zhong Ziya was very strong, but this trap might be targeted at the Apocalypse grade. No matter how powerful Zhong Ziya was, he wasn’t at the Apocalypse grade, making him far inferior.</p>
<p>“You know this, I know it, and Ya knows it very well. Ya got me to tell you to just watch. If needed, he will seek our help. It won’t be too late to go when the time comes. Let’s wait and see. You have your path, and he has his. Let him take his path first,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>Since Zhong Ziya had said that, Zhou Wen had no choice but to hold back his anxiety and watch him walk up the divine mountain.</p>
<p>After arriving at the mountaintop, they saw that the fairy and Wang Mingyuan were still there. The fairy was still whipping Wang Mingyuan. Wang Mingyuan was already covered in injuries from the whipping. His clothes had turned into a blood-colored beggar outfit. He looked like he was on his last breath and the situation wasn’t good. On the square in front of the temple, there were still remnants of the bronze lion’s torn corpse.</p>
<p>The humans watching the livestream were discussing spiritedly and even cursing indignantly. Many people recognized Wang Mingyuan. Even those who had never seen him before gritted their teeth in hatred after hearing the host’s introduction.</p>
<p>From the point of view of the average person, Wang Mingyuan was undoubtedly a traitorthe most shameless human traitor.</p>
<p>“Serves him right. Such a person should have died a long time ago. The heavens are blind to let him live to this day.”</p>
<p>“Humph, traitors indeed don’t have a good ending. Do you think you can enjoy wealth just because you submitted to the dimension? Aren’t you still going to be killed by those fellows from the dimension?”</p>
<p>“This is the first time I’ve seen a human being tortured by alien races. Whip him a few more times and kill that bastard.”</p>
<p>Many people wished they could do the honors of whipping Wang Mingyuan twice or watch him die with their own eyes.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhong Ziya walk to the temple, the fairy who was whipping Wang Mingyuan finally stopped and turned to look at him.</p>
<p>“You… shouldn’t have come…” Wang Mingyuan also raised his pale face and said weakly.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing about whether I should or should not. I came because I felt like it. I’ll leave if I don’t feel like it. No one can stop me,” Zhong Ziya said indifferently, but he didn’t stop walking. He continued walking towards Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>“You are Ya, the president of that whatever association who killed many Guardians and representatives, right?” The fairy glanced at Ya and asked without any expression.</p>
<p>With that said, the people watching the livestream were alarmed. Only then did they realize that Zhong Ziya was Ya.</p>
<p>“I want to take him away. Are you stopping me?” Zhong Ziya carried his sword and had a smile on his lips. His eyes seemed to be covered in a layer of mist as he smiled at the fairy.</p>
<p>“I won’t stop you, but you have to leave your life behind,” the fairy said expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“That’s simple, but you need to seek permission from the sword in my hand. If it accepts, you can do whatever you want with me.” As Zhong Ziya spoke, he suddenly sped up. At the same time, he unsheathed the sword that was resting on his shoulder and stabbed at the beautiful fairy with a startling beam.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1775'>Chapter 1775 Evaluation of Four People</h3>
<p>It was clearly a thrust without any unnecessary variations, but it gave off a wild and tragic aura.</p>
<p>It was as though under this strike, only one person would live. There was no room for negotiation. “This sword technique has already reached a sublime realm. Only after seeing this strike today do I know what a sword technique is,” Professor Gu praised.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, Zhong Ziya’s sword had already stabbed in front of the female Immortal. The female Immortal waved her sleeve and brushed it against the sword. The seemingly soft clothes produced a metallic clang when they collided with the sword.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya’s sword was brushed to the side by the clothes as his body tilted.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya, who had lost his balance, twisted his body in a strange state in midair. He forcefully transformed the thrust into a slash and slashed at the female immortal again.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>The sound of metal clashing sounded incessantly. Zhong Ziya’s sword was brushed away by the sleeve again and again, and again, but he ingeniously made all kinds of variations in the air. From beginning to end, it was an attack without any signs of dodging or retreating</p>
<p>That wild and demonic sword technique was terrifying, but no matter how sharp and demonic his attacks were, they were gently flicked away by the female Immortal. He couldn’t even make her retreat half a step.</p>
<p>Even the spectators felt helpless despair.</p>
<p>What humans were most afraid of wasn’t that the enemy was powerful, but that they couldn’t see hope. Although the female Immortal didn’t take the initiative to attack, it was already enough to make them despair.</p>
<p>If it were an ordinary person, they would probably have been defeated without fighting. Their confidence would have been crushed.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya was Zhong Ziya after all. Under such circumstances, not only did his fighting spirit and confidence not weaken, but it boosted his sacrificial will.</p>
<p>“As expected of Zhong Ziya. However, why does his sword technique feel odd?” Li Xuan praised.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was an extremely determined person, but if he were Zhong Ziya, he would probably feel a little discouraged in such a situation. A person as confident as Zhong Ziya was either a true genius or a true lunatic.</p>
<p>Of course, Li Xuan also had his confidence. He might grumble or feel vexed from being discouraged, but he definitely wouldn’t give up.</p>
<p>However, freaks like Zhong Ziya who didn’t seem to know what fear and despair were were rare.</p>
<p>There were many standards in this world that measured strength. There were also many standards that measured sword techniques. One’s sword could be fast enough, ruthless enough, or even slow enough.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya’s sword technique seemed to possess the highest standards of all kinds of sword techniques. It was fast when it needed to be fast, and slow when it needed to be slow. It was ruthless when it needed to be ruthless, and it was very ingenious when it needed to be ingenious.</p>
<p>However, if one were to really comment on his sword art, there didn’t seem to be any suitable words.</p>
<p>“Senior Zhong Ziya’s sword technique is wild enough!” Feng Qiuyan voiced out everyone’s impression of Zhong Ziya’s sword technique.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s wild. I was wondering why it’s odd. This person’s sword technique is just too wild. It looks very irregular. Many poses and actions are very irregular, but they are very effective. It’s like… like…” Li Xuan couldn’t think of a word to describe it. “It’s like having a dog paddling faster than a swimming champion,” Ming Xiu added.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s the feeling.” Li Xuan nodded immediately. Ming Xiu’s words had hit the nail on the head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sighed and said, “Back then, Jiang Yan, Zhong Ziya, Hui Haifeng, and I studied under Teacher. Teacher once evaluated our talent.”</p>
<p>“What were his comments? Who has the highest talent? It’s definitely you, right?” Li Xuan and company were intrigued. They stopped watching the battle and turned to look at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Although Trajectory Seeking deliberately didn’t look at Zhou Wen, she pricked up her ears to listen. Clearly, she wanted to know what Zhou Wen was about to say.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head and said, “I’m not the one with the highest talent. That’s what Teacher said back then. He said that in terms of talent, Zhong Ziya is a naturally sentimental person. If he has decided on something, he can be extremely devoted. No matter what he learns, he will learn faster than anyone. Therefore, among the four of us, he has the highest talent.”</p>
<p>“What’s your ranking?” Trajectory Seeking couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and company also wanted to know the answer to this question.</p>
<p>“I’m fourth,” Zhou Wen said with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>“No way. Your teacher’s acumen sucks. A person like you is only ranked fourth?”. Trajectory Seeking blurted out. She had already determined that Zhou Wen had extremely invincible talent. Otherwise, how could a human achieve such achievements?</p>
<p>“That’s your grandmaster. Don’t you know how to respect your seniors?” Li Xuan rendered Trajectory Seeking speechless with a single sentence.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued, “Zhong Ziya is sentimental. Jiang Yan’s evaluation is that he’s born a heartless person, while Hui Haifeng’s evaluation is that he’s the most secular person, and I only received a mediocre evaluation. Do you think I’m the one with the worst talent among the four?”</p>
<p>“It’s fine if it’s Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan, but Hui Haifeng’s secular evaluation shouldn’t be as good as yours, right?” Ming Xiu asked. “Most people are secular. To be able to become the cream of the crop among billions of people, how can someone described to be the most secular be inferior to the mediocre?” Zhou Wen sighed and said, “Teacher’s judgment of people is very accurate. When Hui Haifeng later became the Federation President, he indeed reached the peak of the secular world.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Zhou Wen kept paying attention to the battle.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya undoubtedly had the peak combat strength of a Calamity-grade creature. None of his moves seemed to be earth-shattering, nor did they have any dazzling lighting effects. However, it definitely wasn’t because he lacked strength. It was only because he converged all his strength into his body without leaking any.</p>
<p>If it were the past Zhong Ziya, he definitely wouldn’t have cared about such details; it was something that Jiang Yan cared about. Now that Zhong Ziya had done it, it was obvious that many things came to the same end. Perhaps their starting points were different, but in the end, they would all reach the same destination.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya’s sword was brushed away by the female Immortal’s sleeve again. However, this time, the female Immortal didn’t wait for Zhong Ziya to continue attacking. Instead, she suddenly extended her slender hand from her sleeve and grabbed the sword. With a slight shake, she forced Zhong Ziya to release his grip.</p>
<p>With a gentle shake, the female Immortal grabbed the hilt and stabbed at Zhong Ziya.</p>
<p>“She’s imitating Zhong Ziya’s sword technique?” Li Xuan exclaimed with an odd expression. The female Immortal attacked Zhong Ziya repeatedly. Every move she used was clearly once used by Zhong Ziya.</p>
<p>The crux of the matter wasn’t that the moves were the same. Even the wild aura was identical. If one only looked at the sword technique and not at the person, one would think that the person wielding the sword was Zhong Ziya.</p>
<p>She used Zhong Ziya’s sword technique to deal with him, yet she still sent him into a repeated retreat. His body was covered in bloody wounds.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1776'>Chapter 1776 Super Evolution</h3>
<p>“Xuan, take a closer look. Perhaps that path will help you,” Zhou Wen suddenly said to Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Whose path? That female Immortal’s?” Li Xuan asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“No, Zhong Ziya’s,” Zhou Wen said with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>Li Xuan looked at the injured Zhong Ziya. Zhong Ziya clearly had a completely different style from him, but he didn’t doubt Zhou Wen’s words. Instead, he stared intently at Zhong Ziya.</p>
<p>More and more wounds appeared on Zhong Ziya’s body, but they didn’t heal quickly. This was completely different from Li Xuan’s abilities.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan’s eyes gradually lit up.</p>
<p>Although the sword art used by the female Immortal was identical to Zhong Ziya’s sword art, the way she used it crushed him. Or rather, they were on completely different levels.</p>
<p>When solving the same question, although primary school students could do it correctly, another could do it in a relatively more complicated manner. This was the difference thanks to knowledge.</p>
<p>It was the same for Zhong Ziya’s situation now; as long as Zhong Ziya took a look, the same method couldn’t injure him again. Every injury on his body made him rapidly grow.</p>
<p>It sounded simple, but there weren’t many people in this world who could really do it. This was because what people saw was only a sword art, not something deeper behind it.</p>
<p>However, Zhong Ziya could deduce what was involved on the surface and immediately use it for his benefit. This ability was amazing.</p>
<p>The female Immortal’s sword art posed less and less threat to him.</p>
<p>Li Xuan couldn’t help but smile bitterly. “My brain isn’t as good as his. I can’t do it to such an extent.”</p>
<p>“That shouldn’t be your focus.” Zhou Wen shook his head but didn’t say anything else.</p>
<p>Just as people thought that Zhong Ziya’s most difficult period had passed, he began to be injured again. Furthermore, his injuries were worse than before. The sword marks nearly severed his arm.</p>
<p>The female Immortal’s sword art changed again, but it didn’t transcend Zhong Ziya’s sword art.</p>
<p>Different people had different ways of using the same item. This depended on the person, not the item itself.</p>
<p>In the eyes of a peasant, a tree was used to grow flowers and bear fruits. In the eyes of a carpenter, it was a wooden bed or a wooden table. In the eyes of a gardener, it was a part of a garden.</p>
<p>It was the same for sword arts. The same sword art could be given different meanings.</p>
<p>The female Immortal clearly didn’t want to kill Zhong Ziya directly. What she wanted to do was squash Zhong Ziya’s confidence, as well as humanity’s confidence.</p>
<p>A race could fail and decline, but they would ultimately hold out hope for an eventual rise, but once it lost its confidence, even if it could survive, it would only be an auxiliary item.</p>
<p>“You will pay the price for your arrogance.” Zhong Ziya, who was covered in blood, didn’t waver at all.</p>
<p>“I like that look in your eyes,” the female Immortal replied indifferently without stopping her sword.</p>
<p>The sword arts that seemed to contain all the profundity of the world exchanged blows. The same move was used, but they appeared worlds apart. It felt as though Zhong Ziya was completely inadequate.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya was like a trapped beast. Although he was still extremely ferocious, he seemed pitiful.</p>
<p>Before Zhong Ziya could react, the female Immortal had already planted a seed of invincibility in the hearts of the spectating humans. As the battle continued, this seed constantly sprouted and grew stronger.</p>
<p>If Zhong Ziya were to be defeated today, this seed would probably become an eternal wall that made it difficult for humans to regain their confidence as a race.</p>
<p>“Do you know what the strongest talent in the world is?” Zhong Ziya suddenly retreated a distance and said to the female Immortal who wasn’t pursuing him.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” The female Immortal wasn’t afraid that Zhong Ziya would escape. There was no teleportation nexus here, and the Cube couldn’t teleport any creature out. Even if Zhong Ziya wanted to escape, where could he run to in the dimension?</p>
<p>“The strongest talent in the world is evolution. Any creature can become stronger through their own evolution and adapt to different environments to do things that they originally couldn’t do.” Zhong Ziya stared at the female Immortal with a burning gaze as his body gradually underwent some magical changes.</p>
<p>“So?” the female Immortal asked with interest.</p>
<p>“And my talent is Super Evolution.” As Zhong Ziya spoke, the changes in his body suddenly intensified.</p>
<p>His wounds quickly healed and his skin instantly returned to its crystalline snow-white state. There seemed to be a glow flowing over his skin as every strand of hair flowed with a luster.</p>
<p>“Every setback I experience in life, every blow I suffer, and even if I’m covered in wounds, as long as the pain doesn’t kill me, they will ultimately become the cornerstone of my evolution, allowing me to forge the stairs to victory. Every wound you leave on me will bring you closer and closer to the grave…” Zhong Ziya’s eyes burned with zeal.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t look any different,” the female Immortal said indifferently.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya’s body didn’t look any different from before. He wasn’t like Li Xuan. Every time Li Xuan was injured, his carapace would undergo a different change. It was a very obvious evolutionary sign.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya wasn’t the same. His body was no different from before. He still had two hands, two legs, and a head. From Li Xuan’s point of view, Zhong Ziya hadn’t evolved enough.</p>
<p>“My evolution is here.” Zhong Ziya’s eyes seemed to be burning with flames as he pointed at his head.</p>
<p>Just as he said that, Zhong Ziya’s body went into motion again. He charged at the female Immortal and threw a punch at her exquisite face.</p>
<p>The female Immortal stared coldly at Zhong Ziya until his fist was about to reach her. Then, she brandished the sword in her hand again.</p>
<p>The sword was like a beam as it slashed at Zhong Ziya’s fist.</p>
<p>There was no sound of a fist colliding with the blade, nor did the blade slash at Zhong Ziya’s fist.</p>
<p>As though he had predicted the future, Zhong Ziya retracted his seemingly full-strength punch. His other fist suddenly exerted strength and struck the female Immortal’s cheek from an unbelievable angle.</p>
<p>A glint of surprise flashed in the female Immortal’s eyes. Before this, no matter what technique Zhong Ziya used, she could tell at a glance. However, this time, she failed to identify Zhong Ziya’s two fists.</p>
<p>This could only mean one thing—Zhong Ziya’s realm was already close to her level, preventing her from enjoying a higher vantage point.</p>
<p>For the first time, the female Immortal chose to dodge. She took a step to the side and dodged Zhong Ziya’s fist.</p>
<p>With the female Immortal retreating, Zhong Ziya’s attacks poured down like a torrent, preventing the female Immortal from counterattacking. All she could do was constantly retreat and dodge.</p>
<p>The humans watching immediately became pumped, their despairing hearts stirring again.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1777'>Chapter 1777 Transcendent Immortal</h3>
<p>“Interesting.” The female Immortal didn’t seem to feel any pressure as she watched Zhong Ziya with interest.</p>
<p>SH</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya’s attack trajectory was becoming more and more incomprehensible. The female Immortal watched for a while before seemingly coming up with something. She narrowed her eyes and said, “In that case, I’ll let you evolve more thoroughly. Let me see how much your so-called Super Evolution can evolve.”</p>
<p>As she spoke, the female Immortal stopped all her actions and stood there, no longer dodging Zhong Ziya’s attacks.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya’s fist was less than ten centimeters away from the female Immortal’s face, but without any obstruction, Zhong Ziya’s fist seemed to freeze. It stopped moving. Even his entire body seemed to freeze in midair as though it was a frozen scene.</p>
<p>Such a scene made the spectators think that the livestream was stuck, but they quickly realized that it wasn’t a pause in the livestream. Zhong Ziya was frozen in midair.</p>
<p>“My New World is right in front of you. Continue your evolution.” The female Immortal looked at Zhong Ziya calmly without any intention of taking the opportunity to kill him.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya’s eyes burned like flames as he stared at the female Immortal. It was as though he was about to combust, but his body couldn’t move at all.</p>
<p>The sliver of hope that rose in everyone’s hearts was instantly crushed.</p>
<p>At that moment, everyone understood that the hope they imagined was just an illusion.</p>
<p>The female Immortal had never used her true strength to fight Zhong Ziya. Instead of calling it a battle, it was better to say that she was just playing a game.</p>
<p>This blow instantly sank many people’s hearts into a bottomless abyss. The combat strength displayed by both parties was on a completely different level. If the female Immortal really wanted Zhong Ziya dead, Zhong Ziya would have died countless times.</p>
<p>Even Zhang Chunqiu, Xia Liuchuan, and the other top humans frowned when they saw this scene. Their expressions were extremely nasty.</p>
<p>“The difference between the Calamity grade and the Apocalypse grade is too great. Without entering the Apocalypse grade, humans are still lambs waiting to be slaughtered in front of dimensional powerhouses,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“Villains die from talking too much. That female Immortal is too arrogant. Perhaps Zhong Ziya will make her regret her actions,” Xia Liuchuan said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu didn’t say a word as he stared at the Cube’s screen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also stared intently at the Cube’s screen. This was the first time he had seen the power of the Apocalypse grade so clearly. The power had already exceeded the Calamity grade’s understanding of power. He was momentarily unable to analyze what power it belonged to.</p>
<p>However, the word “New World” mentioned by the female Immortal made Zhou Wen confirm that the New World ability Demonic Neonate had was undoubtedly an Apocalypse-grade ability.</p>
<p>A Calamity-grade has the ability of the Apocalypse grade, but her physique hasn’t reached the Apocalypse grade. Does Demonic Neonate have the ability to fight an Apocalypse-grade? Zhou Wen thought to himself, but he had no answer.</p>
<p>“Could the difference between the Calamity grade and the Apocalypse grade really be that great? They can’t even move in front of an Apocalypse-grade powerhouse?” Li Xuan said in despair.</p>
<p>The abilities Zhong Ziya displayed made Li Xuan sigh at his inferiority. However, such a Zhong Ziya was akin to a bug toyed by a cat in front of the female Immortal. When she was sick of toying with him, she could smack him to death with a swipe of her claw. This made Li Xuan feel sad for the loss of his kind.</p>
<p>“No, he’s moving. He’s just moving very slowly,” Jiang Yan said calmly.</p>
<p>When everyone heard Jiang Yan’s words, they couldn’t help but take a closer look. Indeed, they realized that Zhong Ziya was moving, but his movement was so slow that they couldn’t even see it with the naked eye. He was even slower than a snail’s crawl.</p>
<p>“So close, yet so far. Zhong Ziya is less than ten centimeters away from the female Immortal, but it’s as though he’s worlds apart. It’s not that his speed has slowed down, but the space between them has changed.” Zhou Wen had already noticed it and knew a little more.</p>
<p>Trajectory Seeking suddenly added, “You’re right. That female Immortal is a supreme powerhouse of the Immortals. She’s known as a Transcendent Immortal. Even at the Apocalypse grade, she’s an extremely powerful existence. Her New World is called Transcendent Heaven. In her New World, you are confined within the heavens, but she stands beyond it. No matter how close you are to her, that’s a distance between the heavens and the earth. Only she can injure others, but no one can injure her.”</p>
<p>Although Trajectory Seeking didn’t use the honorific title of teacher when speaking to Zhou Wen, she no longer had the contempt from before. It was obvious that she gave Zhou Wen some recognition.</p>
<p>“What the hell is this ability? Doesn’t that mean that they aren’t in the same world? It’s impossible for Zhong Ziya to injure her?” Li Xuan said gloomily.</p>
<p>“Having a Calamity-grade battle an Apocalypse-grade is unfair to begin with,” Trajectory Seeking said. “If it wasn’t for the fact that the Transcendent Immortal is somewhat interested in Zhong Ziya’s abilities, he would have died countless times. This is a battle which has long had an outcome determined.”</p>
<p>“That might not be the case.” Jiang Yan stared at Zhong Ziya, who was at an absolute disadvantage, and slowly said, “That person isn’t a man who will easily admit defeat.”</p>
<p>“So what if he doesn’t admit defeat? In front of absolute strength, all techniques are useless,” Trajectory Seeking said.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Just as Trajectory Seeking finished speaking, they suddenly heard an explosion from the Cube’s screen. They saw Zhong Ziya’s long hair fluttering in the wind, his eyes blood-red like burning blood-colored flames.</p>
<p>His body was abnormally pumping with blood. His skin seemed to be covered in a layer of crystalline sanguine light as his entire body seemed to be enveloped by a thin blood-colored halo.</p>
<p>As the sanguine light on his body intensified, his body began to move as though the power of the New World was ineffective against him.</p>
<p>“Transcendent Heaven’s power failed!” Li Xuan was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>“It’s not that the power of Transcendent Heaven has failed, but Zhong Ziya’s speed is becoming faster. He’s so fast that he can instantly cross worlds. It’s difficult to stop his speed…” Zhou Wen was also very happy.</p>
<p>“You’re too long-winded. I’ve already told you that powers that can’t kill me will become stepping stones for me to scale the peak to victory. I’ll use your blood and bones to forge my victory. Swallow the evil fruit you planted.” Zhong Ziya’s voice was as cold as ice, but his blood-red eyes were fiery. The sanguine light on his body erupted like a volcano.</p>
<p>At that instant, his body completely recovered its mobility. The power of Transcendent Heaven seemed to lose its effect on him.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya was like a hellish devil burning with blood flames. His fist that flickered with blood flames swung crazily at the female Immortal’s face like a blood-colored bolt of lightning. He traversed the ten centimeters instantly.</p>
<p>“He’s about to turn the tables!” Li Xuan was delighted</p>
<p>The billions of humans watching also felt the same joy as him. They couldn’t contain their excitement and had the urge to throw out a punch with Zhong Ziya.</p>
<p>What New World, what Transcendent Heaven, what Apocalypse grade? In front of humans who could evolve infinitely, they were all trash. They would all be smashed to death.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>In the next second, Zhong Ziya’s body suddenly sank. A white hand struck Zhong Ziya’s head, slamming him into the hard rocky ground. His body and limbs twisted into a strange angle.</p>
<p>The blood flames on Zhong Ziya’s body instantly vanished as all his bones were shattered by the strike.</p>
<p>He tried his best, struggling to get up, but he only managed to raise his head slightly before having it plop down. He had lost consciousness and it was unknown if he was dead or alive.</p>
<p>“Super Evolution? Is that it?” The female Immortal was somewhat disappointed. She didn’t look at Zhong Ziya again as though she had just smacked an ant to death.</p>
<p>The Cube’s screen turned black at that moment. It was like a bottomless abyss that devoured the confidence and dignity of all humans. It seemed to cast a spell on the people who had been dancing with joy. Their expressions were ugly as they stood there in a daze. They were at a loss. Most of them were extremely disappointed.</p>
<p>Without any other miracles, Zhong Ziya was defeated.</p>
<p>The female Immortal had given Zhong Ziya all the conditions for growth, but Zhong Ziya was still squashed by a single palm strike. He died like a bug without any dignity.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1778'>Chapter 1778 Bet</h3>
<p>Zhong Ziya’s dead?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood there in a daze for a long time. Although human lives weren’t that precious in this era, with life-and-death separations happening almost every day, Zhou Wen never expected Zhong Ziya to die one day.</p>
<p>To be honest, Zhou Wen hadn’t interacted with Zhong Ziya for long, but his death left Zhou Wen feeling odd.</p>
<p>It was akin to always being with one’s parents and siblings. One wouldn’t have any particularly deep feelings for each other, with people sometimes finding the other party especially annoying, but if something really happened to the other party, indescribable, uncontrollable feelings would erupt.</p>
<p>“Don’t be rash. In fact, what I said previously wasn’t what Zhong Ziya wanted me to pass on to you. What he really said is that if he loses, no one is to go again. Wait for the opportunity to become powerful enough,” Jiang Yan said as he pressed down on Zhou Wen’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“When do we wait till?” Zhou Wen muttered to himself.</p>
<p>“I know you have a powerful dimensional weapon. Perhaps that weapon has the power to fight Transcendent Immortal, but Zhong Ziya’s defeat has already highlighted a problem. External forces are ultimately external forces. If your strength doesn’t reach that level, your body will be a fatal weakness when facing the Apocalypse grade,” Jiang Yan said slowly. “You still need to wait. At the very least, you have to ensure that you can survive. Otherwise, even if you go, you won’t be able to avenge Zhong Ziya, much less save Teacher. You will just be throwing another life at them.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was a very rational person, so he understood Jiang Yan’s words.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya’s abilities were already very strong. Transcendent Immortal had also given him enough opportunities to grow to the point of being able to resist the power of the New World, but he had ultimately been defeated so tragically.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya’s lacking level was his fatal weakness, and it was also applicable to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The Terror grade… is indeed too low… With this in mind, Zhou Wen’s eyes became more resolute.</p>
<p>Without a word, Zhou Wen suddenly used spatial teleportation and left Guide Ancient City.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t head to the divine mountain or the Cube. Instead, he arrived outside Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>Yes, Jiang Yan was right. If he was the weakness, he wouldn’t be able to save Wang Mingyuan even if he went, much less avenge Zhong Ziya. Therefore, he wanted to break through from his current level.</p>
<p>The Apocalypse grade was too far away, but Zhou Wen was still one step short of advancing to the true Calamity grade. As long as he advanced the Demon God Bloodline Catalog he had obtained from Chess Mountain to the Calamity grade, he could truly advance to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>However, he couldn’t obtain the Zone Core from Chess Mountain even in-game. However, there was a shortcut—The Thearch.</p>
<p>On the black mountain wall, the flower was as beautiful as ever. It looked a little frail, as though a strong gust of wind could snap it.</p>
<p>“You’re finally here.” The Thearch wasn’t surprised by his appearance as though she had expected Zhou Wen to come.</p>
<p>“How can the Demon God Bloodline Catalog advance to the Calamity grade?” Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to beat around the bush with The Thearch as he directly revealed his goal.</p>
<p>“It’s very simple. As long as I’m willing, the Demon God Bloodline Catalog can be advanced to the Calamity grade at any time,” The Thearch said with a smile.</p>
<p>“State your conditions.” Zhou Wen was already prepared to pay the price.</p>
<p>“You know very well what I want,” The Thearch said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Impossible.” Zhou Wen naturally knew very well that The Thearch had always hoped to use his strength to escape, so he had always refused to visit Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>“Then it’s also impossible for you,” The Thearch said calmly.</p>
<p>“This is the last time I’m coming to Chess Mountain. Give me an acceptable condition or we’ll go our separate ways from now on.” Zhou Wen was prepared to pay the price, but the price was definitely not to let The Thearch escape.</p>
<p>“What a naive child. Do you think this path belongs to you?” The Thearch teased.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally knew that it wasn’t that he could sever ties with The Thearch just because he said so.</p>
<p>“I want to kill Transcendent Immortal, so if I were to be killed by her, all those paths will have nothing to do with me if I don’t return,” Zhou Wen said calmly.</p>
<p>“You aren’t her match. Even if you have the golden Three-Eyed God, it won’t work. The golden Three-Eyed God is very strong, but you are too weak,” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>“That’s why I came to you,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You are using your life to threaten me. Don’t you find this ridiculous? Why should I care about your life? Do you really think that no one other than you can help me escape?” The Thearch’s voice turned cold.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s what I think,” Zhou Wen said bluntly.</p>
<p>The Thearch seemed to be taken aback. She never expected Zhou Wen to be so straightforward. Moments later, she suddenly said with a laugh, “Although I really want to say that you are nothing, unfortunately, just as you said, only you can help me escape.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was the one taken aback this time. Although he had guessed it long ago, he never expected The Thearch to admit it so bluntly.</p>
<p>“However, your usefulness is only limited to the time before Earth’s seal is completely lifted. Now, Earth can only last for two years at most, so your usefulness will only last two years,” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>“I won’t give you even a second.” Zhou Wen didn’t know if The Thearch was telling the truth. Even if it was true, he wouldn’t release The Thearch ahead of time.</p>
<p>“Hehe…” It was unknown if she was laughing out of anger, but The Thearch laughed so hard that the flower bent its waist.</p>
<p>“Alright, alright, alright. If you want the Zone Core, I can give it to you, but it depends on whether you have the guts to bet with me.” The Thearch continued laughing happily as though she wasn’t angry at all.</p>
<p>“What do you want to bet on?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I’m betting that you will regret it,” The Thearch said meaningfully.</p>
<p>“Regret what?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“Regret killing Transcendent Immortal,” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen never expected The Thearch to bet on this. After some thought, he said firmly, “I definitely won’t regret it.”</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>He could naturally wait, but Wang Mingyuan couldn’t. Zhou Wen didn’t wish to experience seeing the people he cared about die again. Even if his fate was unpredictable, he wouldn’t regret it even if he died in battle.</p>
<p>“Then make a contract with me. If you regret it, something on you will belong to me,” The Thearch said with a smile.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Perhaps it’s your life, your eyes, or your soul. No matter what it is, you can’t reject it, right? If you want to obtain something, you have to pay the price. If you aren’t willing to pay anything and don’t wish to take any risks, you can leave now,” The Thearch said coldly.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen knew that making a bet with The Thearch was no different from making a deal with a devil, but he really couldn’t wait any longer. Furthermore, even if he was defeated, he definitely wouldn’t regret his choice.</p>
<p>“Then make a contract with me…” The Thearch slowly stipulated the contract and got Zhou Wen to repeat it.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen heard the contents of the contract and carefully thought about it, he felt that there was no problem before repeating it.</p>
<p>“Very well. As you wish. The Zone Core you want is there…” The flower’s flower trail spun as a petal fell.</p>
<p>After the petal fell, a figure appeared out of thin air in front of Zhou Wen. It was a beautiful woman.</p>
<p>The woman floated in the air with a blank expression. She couldn’t move her body, and her eyes were filled with shock when she saw Zhou Wen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1779'>Chapter 1779 Living Zone Core</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t unfamiliar with the woman in front of him. An Tianzuo’s sister, An Jing, could be considered his sister from a certain angle.</p>
<p>Of course, neither An Jing nor Zhou Wen admitted to this relationship.</p>
<p>“What’s the meaning of this?” Zhou Wen turned his gaze to the flower and asked coldly.</p>
<p>“Don’t you want Chess Mountain’s Zone Core? Chess Mountain’s Zone Core is on her. She’s a living Zone Core,” The Thearch teased.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by ‘on her?”” Zhou Wen’s expression darkened.</p>
<p>“She was nurtured by me. The Zone Core that’s compatible with her is naturally Chess Mountain’s Zone Core. Now, she has already used Chess Mountain’s Zone Core to advance to the Calamity grade. What do you think I mean?” The Thearch said with a smile.</p>
<p>“You didn’t hand me the Zone Core. Is that a violation of the contract?” Zhou Wen said coldly.</p>
<p>“How did I violate the contract? If you need me to give it to you personally, I can strip the Zone Core from her body and hand it to you.” The Thearch smiled even more happily. “However, without the Zone Core, she naturally can’t be at the Calamity grade. Furthermore, it’s impossible for her to advance to the Calamity grade in the future. Apart from this Zone Core, it’s impossible for there to be a second Zone Core in the world that’s compatible with her.”</p>
<p>“Do you think this will make me regret it?” Zhou Wen said expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“Whether you regret it or not has nothing to do with the contract. I just want you to understand a principle. There’s no free lunch in this world. You aren’t willing to pay the price, yet you want to obtain such a precious item. How can there be such a good thing in this world?” The Thearch smiled and said, “Young people have to firmly remember that this world isn’t revolving around them. It’s not something you can do as you wish. You have to pay the corresponding price for what you want. The benefits that don’t require you to pay might end up making you lose even more.”</p>
<p>“How will you choose now? Do you want me to personally give you the Zone Core?” The Thearch smiled very happily.</p>
<p>How could Zhou Wen not know the truth behind The Thearch’s words? Since he wanted to make a deal with the devil, he was already prepared to pay the price. However, he never expected such a situation.</p>
<p>However, even so, Zhou Wen didn’t regret coming here, nor did he regret making a bet with The Thearch.</p>
<p>He turned to look at the motionless An Jing. In fact, Zhou Wen hadn’t paid much attention to her before today because he had never paid attention to her.</p>
<p>An Jing looked at Zhou Wen with a complicated expression. From Zhou Wen’s conversation with The Thearch, she understood what was going on.</p>
<p>An Jing originally imagined that she had obtained a huge opportunity, but she never expected it to turn out this way. She couldn’t help but feel disheartened.</p>
<p>She worked hard to prove that she wasn’t inferior to Zhou Wen, but the distance between the two of them grew.</p>
<p>After meeting The Thearch, she believed that she finally had a chance to catch up or even surpass Zhou Wen. She never expected that she was just a bargaining chip between The Thearch and Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Perhaps it wasn’t even considered a bargaining chip because there was still a chance of winning the bet, but she didn’t stand any chance. With a word from Zhou Wen, her hard-earned achievements would be stripped away.</p>
<p>An Jing had a deep understanding of The Thearch’s words.</p>
<p>“It’s something that doesn’t belong to me. Take it away,” An Jing suddenly said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>She didn’t need Zhou Wen’s pity, much less have him give in to her. She would rather start all over again. Otherwise, it would be meaningless even if she succeeded. If she accepted Zhou Wen’s pity, she wouldn’t have the right to say anything about surpassing him.</p>
<p>“Hehe, did you hear that? She’s willing to sacrifice herself for you. What a good sister. What shall be your choice? Do you want me to take the Zone Core out of her and give it to you now?” The Thearch’s voice sounded indescribably disgusting to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Of course I want the Zone Core,” Zhou Wen said calmly. “However, do you dare make a bet with me?”</p>
<p>“Oh, you want to make a bet with me?” The flower bud turned to Zhou Wen and sized him up with interest.</p>
<p>“Yes, do you dare?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to showcase your clumsy goading. I can tell you clearly now that I’ll accept any bet. Even if it’s an unfair bet, it’s fine. Just tell me what you want the bet to be,” The Thearch said with a smile.</p>
<p>“My bet is very fair. I want to bet on luck.” Although The Thearch made it very clear that she would accept an unfair bet, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on making such a bet.</p>
<p>This was because Zhou Wen knew very well that his knowledge wasn’t on the same level as The Thearch’s. Even if he believed that he would definitely win, he might not. Furthermore, he might lose even more tragically.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you want to bet on luck with me? You’ve probably forgotten that to me, even if it’s a one in a billion chance, as long as I’m willing, it’s a hundred percent chance. I suggest that you bet on something that has a higher chance of winning. For example, you can bet that you are a man, or you can bet that I won’t die today. That way, your chances of winning will be higher,” The Thearch persuaded sincerely.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. Since it’s a bet, it has to be absolutely fair. I’ll bet with you on luck. If you don’t win, her Zone Core won’t count. Give me another Zone Core. If I lose, her Zone Core will still be yours. The previous bet will still be valid. Furthermore, it will be as you wish. I’ll help you escape now.” Zhou Wen shook his head.</p>
<p>“As you wish. How do you want to bet on your luck?” The Thearch was truly intrigued. She wanted to know how Zhou Wen was going to bet.</p>
<p>“I want to bet with you on who will live longer.” Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate as he revealed the bet he had thought of.</p>
<p>After The Thearch heard Zhou Wen’s bet, she immediately understood his intentions. She said disdainfully, “You want to bet that I’ll live longer than you, right?”</p>
<p>“No, I want to bet that I’ll live longer than you,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>The Thearch couldn’t help but be slightly taken aback because it was impossible for Zhou Wen to win with such a bet.</p>
<p>If The Thearch was willing, she could kill Zhou Wen. Then, she would naturally win the bet. Therefore, this was a bet that was suicidal.</p>
<p>What kind of person was The Thearch? After some thought, she immediately understood Zhou Wen’s thoughts. Her voice turned cold. “Do you really think I won’t kill you? It’s best if you don’t test my patience. My tolerance is very limited.”</p>
<p>“You can kill me, but you won’t be able to win if you kill me. You will still lose the bet,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Why can’t I win after killing you?” The Thearch was somewhat curious. She couldn’t figure out why she would still lose after killing Zhou Wen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1780'>Chapter 1780 Analysis</h3>
<p>“If you kill me and win this bet, it will be impossible for you to win the other bet. You can only win one of the two bets. If you don’t kill me, you might win both bets. Do you want to win one bet or two?” Zhou Wen said slowly.</p>
<p>“Are you betting your life that I have to win both rounds?” The Thearch’s voice was somewhat cold.</p>
<p>An Jing also looked at Zhou Wen in shock. There was no need for Zhou Wen to do so. He could have directly taken her Zone Core.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had used his life to bet on the second Zone Core and not her Zone Core. This was unacceptable to An Jing.</p>
<p>Why? Is it because of me? An Jing looked at Zhou Wen in a daze as her expression turned more and more complicated.</p>
<p>“I’m betting that a person like you won’t accept such an imperfect outcome,” Zhou Wen said calmly.</p>
<p>“I never expected you to know me so well, but I can very well not kill you. The bet will still be in progress. I don’t need to give you the Zone Core, and I will still win everything,” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>“You can naturally make such a choice, but before I obtain the Zone Core, the first bet will not be valid. Besides, I’ve already said that if you don’t win, you will give me another Zone Core, right? The bet is still ongoing, which means you haven’t won yet,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Do you think such a language trap can restrain me?” The Thearch said disdainfully.</p>
<p>“No, I just believe that you don’t want a meaningless victory. Besides, you care more about the other bet.”</p>
<p>“What if that’s how I want to win?” The Thearch said. “I’ll head to the divine mountain now,” Zhou Wen said without any hesitation.</p>
<p>The Thearch fell silent. Just as Zhou Wen had said, the chances of Zhou Wen surviving without obtaining the Zone Core to head to the divine mountain were almost zero. Such a victory was indeed meaningless to her.</p>
<p>The Thearch didn’t want Zhou Wen’s life, but to win the bet.</p>
<p>“You’re right. I want to win, but not like this.” The Thearch didn’t seem interested in continuing the conversation. The flower shook and a petal fell.</p>
<p>The mountain wall of Chess Mountain parted like a door as a demonic beam flew out and headed straight for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out to grab the stream of light and saw that it was a purple multifaceted crystal. It was like lightning and fog that constantly changed.</p>
<p>“Scram.”</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen heard The Thearch’s voice, he looked up at the mountain wall and realized that it had already closed. The flower had also vanished.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>An Jing’s voice sounded from behind him. He turned around and saw her staring at him with a strange expression.</p>
<p>“What do you mean why?” Zhou Wen asked casually</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you take my Zone Core? Why did you bet your life?” An Jing bit her lip and asked.</p>
<p>“We’re family, right?” Zhou Wen turned around and left. “I still have something on. I’ll make a move first.”</p>
<p>“Family?” An Jing was taken aback as she watched Zhou Wen tear through space and vanish.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen didn’t mind An Jing, he had already accepted Ouyang Lan and An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>There was no need to mention Ouyang Lan. She had always treated Zhou Wen well. As for An Tianzuo, although he had never treated Zhou Wen nicely, Zhou Wen knew very well that if not for An Tianzuo’s orders, An Sheng wouldn’t have done so much for him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was someone who preferred soft tactics over hard tactics. An Tianzuo had done so many things for him, so he wasn’t willing to let An Jing end up in such a state unless it was absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>He teleported back to Guide Ancient City. He originally wanted to immediately absorb the Zone Core and advance to the Calamity grade, but he heard more grievous news.</p>
<p>“Jiang Yan is also finished?” Zhou Wen looked at Li Xuan in a daze, unable to recover from his shock.</p>
<p>“He said that there were some things he had to do. The opportunity Zhong Ziya risked his life to exchange for allowed him to see the fatal weakness of the Transcendent Immortal. Therefore, he had to give it a try no matter what. Also, before he left, he told me to tell you that if he loses, he knows that you will definitely go. He also knows that nothing can stop you.” Li Xuan sighed and said, “He said that if you have to go, study his battle with Transcendent Immortal a few more times. Go when you are confident.”</p>
<p>“Is he dead?” Zhou Wen asked angrily.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan had clearly persuaded him not to go, but he had gone himself.</p>
<p>“I don’t know… See for yourself…” Li Xuan played the recording of the battle.</p>
<p>The projection began when Jiang Yan ascended the divine mountain. There was another white jade pillar in front of the temple with Zhong Ziya chained to it.</p>
<p>However, he was different from Wang Mingyuan who was clearly still alive. Zhong Ziya’s limbs and head drooped down. His body relied on the chains that penetrated it to prevent him from falling. It was unknown if he was dead or alive.</p>
<p>The battle between Jiang Yan and Transcendent Immortal wasn’t complicated. It could even be said to be simple. He lost even faster than Zhong Ziya and was defeated in one strike. His fate was unknown as he fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that it wasn’t because Jiang Yan was weaker than Zhong Ziya. On the contrary, Jiang Yan posed a greater threat to Transcendent Immortal, so he made her serious from the beginning.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched the battle between Jiang Yan and Transcendent Immortal repeatedly. Although it was only one move, Zhou Wen saw many things.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan, who was wearing Guardian armor, had fused with the Guardian at a high level and reached the peak of the Calamity grade. However, he was different from Zhong Ziya. Jiang Yan didn’t have the Super Evolution ability, so it was impossible for him to crack the power of Transcendent Heaven like Zhong</p>
<p>Ziya.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan used another method that was unique to him.</p>
<p>If Zhong Ziya’s ability was to be an enemy to the world, Jiang Yan’s power was to assimilate the world.</p>
<p>All powers could be used for himself. In Transcendent Heaven, as Jiang Yan walked towards Transcendent Immortal, he also assimilated and absorbed Transcendent Heaven.</p>
<p>When he arrived in front of Transcendent Immortal, Jiang Yan’s strength and ability had almost reached the same level as hers.</p>
<p>Instead of saying that the strike was a battle between Jiang Yan and the Transcendent Immortal, it was more like a battle between two Transcendent Immortals. They had the same strength and the same move, but Jiang Yan still failed to withstand a single strike.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen trembled as he watched. Jiang Yan’s battle was filled with the determination to die. He didn’t do it to defeat Transcendent Immortal, but to let Zhou Wen see the essence of her strength.</p>
<p>The power displayed by Transcendent Immortal was only superficial. It was difficult to see the true profundity from watching the battle.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan used the power and ability of Transcendent Immortal to clearly show the profundity within. This wasn’t a battle; it was more of an analysis.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan used his life to analyze the essence of the power of Transcendent Immortal.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen finished watching, he didn’t say a word as he returned to his room. He summoned Demonic Neonate and the golden trident to guard the area outside and took out the Zone Core.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1781'>Chapter 1781 Divine Path Human Path</h3>
<p>As the Demon God Bloodline Catalog circulated, the purple Zone Core gradually fused into Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>The Demon God Bloodline Catalog was a very bizarre cultivation technique that could simulate the power of any demon. This was very rare among all the cultivation techniques.</p>
<p>It was similar to Jiang Yan’s abilities, but it wasn’t as direct. Furthermore, there were more restrictions.</p>
<p>Not being direct and having many restrictions didn’t mean it was weak. In fact, having restrictions meant it had more possibilities. The Demon God Bloodline Catalog also had its advantages.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a magical change happening inside his body. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that the change was a complete transformation.</p>
<p>His blood boiled like magma, as though it wanted to melt his entire body.</p>
<p>Legend had it that when demons reached a certain realm, they would take human form. This process was known as ‘Taking Form.’ And now, Zhou Wen’s body’s transformation was similar. The entire structure of his body seemed to have changed.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen didn’t need to take human form. His body didn’t undergo any changes in appearance, but his body gained more possibilities.</p>
<p>Finally, a new Calamity Zone was formed. The Demon God Bloodline Catalog had successfully advanced to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to carefully take in the Demon God Bloodline Catalog that had advanced to the Calamity grade, his body suddenly underwent an even more intense change.</p>
<p>The Lost Immortal Sutra that had been silent all this while finally erupted again. As for the eight cultivation techniques that had condensed a Calamity Zone, they were like eight reservoirs that constantly provided the Lost Immortal Sutra with all sorts of energy.</p>
<p>No, to be precise, Lost Immortal Sutra was extracting energy.</p>
<p>Sas</p>
<p>An indescribable sense of comfort ran through Zhou Wen’s every nerve. It was as though he was about to ascend to immortality. The feeling was intoxicating.</p>
<p>If anyone saw Zhou Wen at that moment, they would probably be shocked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, who was sitting there, wasn’t surrounded by lightning, nor was there any colorful energy flowing. All he did was have his eyes open; they were glazed over as though he was in a trance.</p>
<p>His skin was slightly sweaty, but his cheeks were so pink that it made one’s heart tremble.</p>
<p>No matter how one looked at it, he looked like a young girl having a wet dream. There was even a hint of a seductive smile on his lips.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t feel as comfortable as he looked.</p>
<p>On the ravaged land, magma spewed out. A god stood high above the clouds as he looked down at the primitive land. His eyes were as indifferent as water, as though he wasn’t looking at the mortal world, but a lifeless desert.</p>
<p>“The Heavenly Path is my path, and this path is nature.”</p>
<p>A voice seemed to echo from the god’s body. As the god’s mood changed, the entire land changed.</p>
<p>All things grew and withered as the land underwent changes. The sea rose and fell as generations constantly replaced one another in the river of history.</p>
<p>It was an unimaginable divine power. A thought from a god resulted in change to all things.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body was uncontrollably massaged by the divine power. One moment it was water, another moment it was stone, and another moment it was grass.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was feeling alarmed by the irresistible divine power, he saw the god in the sky turn into another. It was a god that resembled light and lightning. His face couldn’t be discerned, but he felt boundless divine power ripple out of him. The world turned dark.</p>
<p>“Let there be light.” His psyche fluctuated.</p>
<p>Hence, there was light in the dark world.</p>
<p>“Let there be trees.”</p>
<p>Hence, there were trees in the empty world.</p>
<p>“Let there be clouds.”</p>
<p>Clouds appeared in the empty sky.</p>
<p>Everything in the world appeared out of thin air with a thought. The originally dark and empty world gradually became colorful.</p>
<p>Gods constantly appeared up to a total of eight gods. Every god displayed unimaginable divine power. It was a power that mortals could only look up to, making Zhou Wen feel as tiny as an ant.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had never seen those gods before, but he could tell from the divine power they emitted that they were the eight cultivation techniques he had cultivated.</p>
<p>However, the realm they displayed was far beyond what the present Zhou Wen could reach.</p>
<p>After the eight gods were displayed one by one, the world returned to the desolate scene of a flooded land. However, on the ravaged land, there was an additional weak human figure.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen could only see the back, he couldn’t tell who it was. It looked like a girl as she seemed to be advancing with great effort. Every step she took was staggering as though she would collapse at any moment.</p>
<p>Step by step, the girl fell countless times. Finally, she failed to stand up in front of a lake.</p>
<p>As for her hand, it was still extended towards the lake. Even in death, she failed to fulfill her wish, even if all she wanted was a sip of water.</p>
<p>“Divine Path has no joy; Human Path is intrinsically sad.” A voice sounded beside Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen turned around and saw a woman standing beside him.</p>
<p>Although her face couldn’t be seen, Zhou Wen immediately knew who she was—the woman from the Sigh of the King.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to ask, but he couldn’t say a word.</p>
<p>“It’s time to make a choice, what will you choose: the Divine Path or the Human Path?” The woman didn’t look at Zhou Wen as she stared at the spot where the sky and ground met.</p>
<p>Eight gods appeared in the sky one by one, and the girl stood up again and continued forward. However, the lake in front of her had already vanished. Wherever she looked, there was nothing. It was just a dilapidated land that resembled the end of the world.</p>
<p>“Who… are you…” Zhou Wen asked again, but this time, he managed to voice it out.</p>
<p>The woman didn’t answer as she smiled. With a wave of her hand, the world shattered. The eight gods and the girl vanished, waking Zhou Wen from the dream-like world.</p>
<p>The power of the eight cultivation techniques had already been fused by the Lost Immortal Sutra. Zhou Wen suddenly realized that he was still problematic.</p>
<p>This was a critical period for condensing the Calamity Zone. The eight cultivation techniques were originally simulated by the Lost Immortal Sutra, but Zhou Wen didn’t have the physique needed for the eight cultivation techniques.</p>
<p>At this stage, by fusing the power of the eight cultivation techniques with the Lost Immortal Sutra, he could truly possess the power of eight Calamity Zones at the same time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already very familiar with these eight powers. At the same time, he could already see the future of the eight powers in the illusion.</p>
<p>Having eight Calamity Zones at the same time was something unreachable even for supreme existences in the dimension, much less a human.</p>
<p>However, retaining these eight powers also meant losing the chance of condensing a Calamity Zone that belonged to him.</p>
<p>Two paths-one was filled with light, while the other was filled with unknowns.</p>
<p>“Are you trying to tell me that you are my other path?” Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate as he circulated the Lost Immortal Sutra. The surging power instantly surged towards his brain as the Calamity Zone began to officially condense.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1782'>Chapter 1782 Advancing to the Calamity Grade</h3>
<p>“If the Divine Path is an analogy to reaching the peak once success is reached, then the Human Path is a weakling’s growth history. The peak is the benefits that are truly in one’s hands, but the future is ultimately unpredictable.</p>
<p>“Life isn’t a game. There are too many accidents and there’s no chance of a redo. No one knows if there will really be a day when one will grow up. Most people in reality will collapse halfway like the girl in the illusion.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew very well that although the woman seemed to have given him a choice between the Divine Path and the Human Path, she hadn’t really given him a choice.</p>
<p>Be it the Divine Path or the Human Path, they had their own flaws.</p>
<p>What the woman really wanted to tell him was that a third path existed—Godhood Human Path.</p>
<p>It fused the Divine Path and Human Path, and used the realm of deities as a foundation; yet, one had to constantly seek a breakthrough like a human.</p>
<p>“Could this be your path?” Zhou Wen didn’t know the woman’s origins or what experiences she had, but from the realm of the Godhood Human Path, the woman was probably as great as Zhou Wen had seen in his dreams.</p>
<p>“Your path has supreme glory, but that’s ultimately not my path. I’m not at your level. Even with that state of mind, it’s difficult for me to do anything.” Zhou Wen didn’t choose the Godhood Human Path mentioned by the woman. He ultimately chose the Human Path without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Only by visiting all the mountains could one say that there were no more mountains left in the world. Only by plucking all the flowers could one say that there were no more flowers that caught one’s eye. If one had never experienced anything, how could they dare say that they had no worries?</p>
<p>The Human Path implied all the good and bad of the human world. Only when one was flourishing after experiencing all that the world had to offer could they be considered having a Human Path Godhood.</p>
<p>With his mind set, he constantly circulated the Lost Immortal Sutra as strange powers overlapped, transforming into a strange force field.</p>
<p>Deep in his soul, there seemed to be a woman’s sigh. It was unknown if it was sorrow or disappointment.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The Terror grade that had bound Zhou Wen for a long time was finally broken through. He seemed to be reborn as the world seemed to widen in his eyes.</p>
<p>Humans have their paths as humans. Gods have their paths as gods. I’m not a god, but I’ve stepped onto the divine path… Zhou Wen stood up and took out his phone to check his stats.</p>

<p>After reading the information, Zhou Wen knew that he was already standing at the true peak of the Calamity grade. Like Demonic Neonate, he had all his stats at 1000. His Calamity Zone was already at the Heaven level.</p>
<p>Such stats could be said to be unparalleled among Calamity-grade creatures, but Zhou Wen wasn’t confident that he could withstand an attack from Transcendent Immortal.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen wasn’t fighting alone. He still had the golden trident, Demonic Neonate, and a group of Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen had another important guarantee—the divine mountain dungeon that had been downloaded by the mysterious phone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had clearly taken away the most important golden Three-Eyed God on the divine mountain, but the Cube battle hadn’t ended. This was a very important problem.</p>
<p>If he could figure out why the Cube battle hadn’t ended, it might be key to Zhou Wen’s success in rescuing Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>After launching the divine mountain dungeon, the Lake of Fog and the golden fruit tree remained. He controlled the blood-colored avatar to come in front of the golden fruit tree and casually plucked a golden fruit.</p>
<p>As expected, as long as he had the golden fruit, he could leave the divine mountain dungeon at any time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the golden fruit in-game couldn’t be brought to reality. These things were meaningless to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Summoning Demonic Neonate, he pushed down the golden fruit tree and revealed the entrance to the temple. He entered the temple buried at the bottom of the lake, but he didn’t see the golden Three-Eyed God. The entire temple was empty.</p>
<p>There’s actually no golden Three-Eyed God in the dungeon. That’s strange. From the looks of it, the thing needed to clear the dungeon isn’t the golden trident. What could it be? Zhou Wen carefully searched the temple.</p>
<p>The temple was extremely huge. Every item was many times bigger than what humans used. The stone throne, stone pillars, and stone sculptures were all tools carved from black stone. Apart from that, there was nothing else.</p>
<p>He searched the entire temple but didn’t find anything. Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised. If it was that easy to discover the key, the divine mountain in the real world would have long been overturned by the Immortals. They would have long found it.</p>
<p>The battle of the Cube hadn’t ended, meaning that the Immortals hadn’t found anything. It was normal for Zhou Wen to not find anything since even Apocalypse-grade powerhouses couldn’t find it.</p>
<p>Apart from the monster in the Lake of Fog and the golden fruit tree, there’s no living creature in the entire dungeon. There’s no danger in the temple. What’s the point of such a dungeon existing? Zhou Wen frowned in thought.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up as he hurriedly left the temple’s exit and floated in the air to look at the entire island.</p>
<p>Could it be… The true item to clear this game dungeon… is this divine mountain… Zhou Wen sized it up for a while and muttered to himself.</p>
<p>The divine mountain in-game didn’t rise out of the lake like in reality. It was still beneath the lake, and there was nothing in the temple. No matter how one looked at it, the only treasure was the divine mountain itself.</p>
<p>However, be it in-game or in reality, the divine mountain was an unparalleled huge existence. It was probably more than ten thousand meters tall. Furthermore, the divine mountain’s material was extremely hard and heavy. Ordinary Calamity-grade creatures couldn’t damage it at all.</p>
<p>It was probably more difficult to uproot such a divine mountain than destroying a planet. Even the Apocalypse-grade powerhouses probably couldn’t do it, much less Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>If it could be stored away, Transcendent Immortal would have long done so. Why would she leave the divine mountain there?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t give up. He burrowed into the temple that was situated in the divine mountain’s belly and carefully observed every inch of the black stone, hoping to find some clues.</p>
<p>After a carpet sweep, Zhou Wen finally discovered something.</p>
<p>So that’s how it is. It’s no wonder the Cube battle didn’t end. I was missing something. Zhou Wen looked at the sculpture behind the black stone foundation and was immediately enlightened.</p>
<p>The carvings were mysterious and strange. They depicted some strange beasts. In the middle was a strange beast facing forward. It had three eyes like the Gods, but the pupils in the middle of the three eyes were hollowed out. Zhou Wen took a look and saw that the shapes, positions, and distances of the three holes matched the golden trident’s tips.</p>
<p>These three holes corresponded to the golden trident. If his guess was right, he had to stick the golden trident in to activate a mechanism or end the Cube’s battle.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen hadn’t taken that step after obtaining the golden trident. Therefore, the Cube battle hadn’t ended.</p>
<p>However, there’s no golden Three-Eyed God in-game, so there’s no golden trident. How do I clear the level? Zhou Wen thought for a while but failed to figure it out.</p>
<p>Since the golden trident couldn’t be brought into the game, Zhou Wen couldn’t experiment. He could give it a try in reality, but he didn’t know what would happen.</p>
<p>Unable to find any other clues, Zhou Wen had no choice but to give up and call Li Xuan over.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan, if I don’t return this time, there’s nothing to worry about. My dad can take care of himself, and Ya’er has someone to take care of her. As for you, I’m a little worried. There’s something you have to promise me,” Zhou Wen said solemnly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1783'>Chapter 1783 Appearance</h3>
<p>“If you’re worried, come back and do it yourself. Stop yapping.” Li Xuan sneered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen smiled. “Who the f*ck doesn’t want to return? But if I don’t return, guard Guide Ancient City if you can. If not, there’s no need to force it. You have to survive.”</p>
<p>“If you know that survival is important, think of every possible way to return. Back then, we agreed to build a city together. The city is now here, and so am I, so you better f*cking return here,” Li Xuan said as he stared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What if…” Zhou Wen wanted to say something, but he was interrupted by Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“There’s no what-if. It’s easy to abandon the city, but where can we go?” Li Xuan asked in response.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly stunned before he smiled. “That’s true. Where can you retreat</p>
<p>to?”</p>
<p>“It’s good that you understand. Make sure to return. The city exists with you around.” Li Xuan’s tone was relaxed, but his word was worth its weight in gold.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen stared at Li Xuan for a moment before nodding and walking out.</p>
<p>Just as he walked out of the courtyard, he saw a graceful figure standing beside the stone path. She was leaning against an ancient wall and looking at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Yuzhi…” Zhou Wen was slightly stunned when he saw Zhang Yuzhi.</p>
<p>“Are you leaving?” Zhang Yuzhi asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded slightly and didn’t say anything. In fact, he didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>“Can you not go?” she asked again.</p>
<p>“There are certain things that will eat at you your entire life if you don’t do them,” Zhou Wen said. Zhang Yuzhi stared at Zhou Wen and didn’t say a word. After a while, she suddenly walked in front of Zhou Wen, spread her arms, hugged him, and whispered into his ear, “Come back.”</p>
<p>With that said, she released her grip and left without waiting for Zhou Wen’s answer.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared blankly as Zhang Yuzhi’s figure went into the distance. When she reached the corner of the street, Zhang Yuzhi suddenly turned around and smiled brightly. “When you return, let’s visit Mount Dragon Tiger.”</p>
<p>As he watched the beautiful figure turn the corner and disappear, Zhou Wen didn’t understand why Zhang Yuzhi wanted him to visit Mount Dragon Tiger.</p>
<p>After some thought, he threw all his thoughts to the back of his mind and headed for the Cube.</p>
<p>He originally wanted to make a trip to Luoyang to visit Ya’er, Ouyang Lan, and his father—who he hadn’t talked much with.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t go in the end. He was a person who didn’t like partings. If he really couldn’t return, he hoped that he would be quickly forgotten and no longer be missed. The Cube kept showing the scene of the divine mountain. Wang Mingyuan, Zhong Ziya, and Jiang Yan were chained to the white jade pillars in front of the temple. The Transcendent Immortal was in the temple and couldn’t be seen.</p>
<p>“Professor Gu, in your opinion, is it possible for Human Sovereign to defeat Transcendent Immortal if he fights?” Su Yi asked on the live broadcast.</p>
<p>She had always trusted Human Sovereign and firmly believed that Human Sovereign was the strongest human. If it were in the past, she definitely wouldn’t have asked such a question. However, Transcendent Immortal was too strong, so strong that it left her in despair. Even a powerhouse like Human Sovereign couldn’t give her a sufficient sense of security.</p>
<p>“An Apocalypse grade. That’s a gap that humans can’t cross at present.” Professor Gu didn’t answer Su Yi directly, but his meaning was obvious. The people watching the live broadcast were very unhappy with this sentence, but they had to admit that there was nothing wrong with Professor Gu’s words.</p>
<p>ere</p>
<p>From the looks of it, there was no Apocalypse-grade existence among humans. Nobody even knew how to reach the Apocalypse grade.</p>
<p>Even existences like Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan —who had used everything they had and even their lives-couldn’t withstand a single blow from Transcendent Immortal. The difference in strength was despairing.</p>
<p>Su Yi lost interest in talking for a moment, causing the live broadcast to fall silent.</p>
<p>As a professional host, she shouldn’t have let such a situation happen. However, she really couldn’t bring herself to speak. She felt a deep sense of powerlessness.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the Cube’s still screen stirred as a figure appeared on the divine mountain.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen?” Su Yi couldn’t help but exclaim when she saw the figure on the screen clearly.</p>
<p>After two human powerhouses suffered a crushing defeat, Zhou Wen actually appeared on the divine mountain at this moment. It gave them an ominous feeling.</p>
<p>“Why did you choose such a time?” Professor Gu couldn’t help but frown.</p>
<p>Everyone knew very well that there was probably no existence among humans that could resist Transcendent Immortal. Jiang Yan and Zhong Ziya’s two battles had already made everyone realize this clearly.</p>
<p>It didn’t seem like a good choice to rashly fight Transcendent Immortal now.</p>
<p>“Too rash… Too rash… Be it Zhong Ziya or Jiang Yan, as long as they can wait two more years, even if it’s only one year, such elites might very well grow to the point of fighting Transcendent Immortal. But now, they have sacrificed themselves for nothing. Now, Zhou Wen has gone as well… He’s really too young… Too rash… Sigh…” Professor Gu found it a pity and was even a little angry, having expected better from Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>It was indeed as he said. If Zhou Wen had waited a year or two, he might have full confidence in defeating Transcendent Immortal. But what was the point of winning when the time came?</p>
<p>Doing the right things at the right time was one thing, but some things couldn’t be repeated for the rest of their lives once they were missed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked up the divine mountain step by step and arrived in front of the temple. He stared at Zhong Ziya, Jiang Yan, and Wang Mingyuan-who were chained to the white jade pillars.</p>
<p>His heart couldn’t help but sink when he saw Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan clearly.</p>
<p>Through the Cube, he couldn’t determine if the two of them had completely lost their lives. Therefore, Zhou Wen still had a sliver of hope that they still had a chance of survival.</p>
<p>But after observing them at close range, Zhou Wen’s heart turned cold. They had indeed completely lost their lives, and it was impossible for them to be revived.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Wang Mingyuan still had life in him and wasn’t weak. His injuries weren’t as serious as imagined.</p>
<p>“You’re finally here.” Transcendent Immortal’s voice sounded as she walked out of the temple.</p>
<p>“Someone has to collect the debt owed.” Zhou Wen sized up Transcendent Immortal as he spoke.</p>
<p>“How do you want to collect it?” Transcendent Immortal asked calmly.</p>
<p>“Blood for blood.” Zhou Wen’s gaze was like a blade as he stared at Transcendent Immortal. He walked forward slowly, and stars appeared around him. In an instant, it was as if all the stars in the sky were shining brightly.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen advanced, the stars in the sky turned into straight shooting stars that rushed at Transcendent Immortal. The densely packed light swords streaked across the void like a torrent and overlapped as they attacked Transcendent Immortal.</p>
<p>There was no extreme speed or infinite variations, just pure suppression of strength.</p>
<p>A human competing in strength with the Apocalypse-grade Transcendent Immortal? Will that work? The watching humans were filled with doubts.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1784'>Chapter 1784 Power of the Human World</h3>
<p>Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan’s two battles with Transcendent Immortal had already made everyone aware of the gap between humans and Transcendent Immortal.</p>
<p>Be it Zhong Ziya or Jiang Yan, their strength was greatly inferior to that of a Transcendent Immortal at the beginning of the battle. It was almost an insurmountable gap.</p>
<p>It didn’t seem wise for Zhou Wen to fight Transcendent Immortal head-on.</p>
<p>“Ignorant human.” Transcendent Immortal was as still as a mountain. The thousands of sword beams were less than a meter away from her, but they seemed to be frozen.</p>
<p>Instead of describing them as frozen, the sword beams were still moving, albeit very slowly. They were so slow that the movement couldn’t be seen with the naked eye. It could hardly traverse one-thousandth of a meter in ten thousand years.</p>
<p>Everyone seemed to freeze with the sword beam, and even their breathing seemed to stop.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan had attempted different methods to crack Transcendent Heaven’s powers. Then, what method would Zhou Wen use to crack that insurmountable power?</p>
<p>They weren’t as wild as Zhong Ziya or as confident as Jiang Yan. There weren’t even any deliberate variations. They were the same seemingly infinite sword beams as more and more of them gathered in front of Transcendent Immortal.</p>
<p>“Great things are done by a series of small things brought together. Is he trying to crack it with absolute strength? Is this really feasible?” Professor Gu explained in a questioning tone, clearly not agreeing with this method.</p>
<p>“Using quantity to result in a qualitative change might be a feasible path…” Su Yi’s tone wasn’t that firm.</p>
<p>In fact, everyone knew very well that with the characteristics of Transcendent Heaven, it was useless to just accumulate strength.</p>
<p>Luoyang’s An family.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo—who always spoke nastily-was silently watching the Cube’s screen.</p>
<p>An Sheng turned to look at An Tianzuo, finding it a little strange that An Tianzuo didn’t flare up this time. Zhou Wen was taking more risks than ever before.</p>
<p>“Is it strange?” An Tianzuo asked indifferently as he watched the scene.</p>
<p>“Yes, Young Master Wen is in danger this time. If he loses, he probably won’t even have a chance to escape.” It was rare for An Sheng to speak so calmly.</p>
<p>“It’s precisely because failure is not an option that it’s meaningless to say anything.”</p>
<p>“Then, shouldn’t you be angrier?” An Sheng asked in confusion.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo smiled. “Men always have things they have to do despite knowing that it’s impossible. Only such a man can be called a brother of mine.”</p>
<p>An Sheng almost thought that there was something wrong with his ears. He really couldn’t imagine those words coming out of An Tianzuo’s mouth.</p>
<p>“Is this all you have?” Transcendent Immortal ignored the increasing number of sword beams in front of her.</p>
<p>The difference in levels couldn’t be changed simply by accumulating strength. “You’re inferior to those two arrogant fellows. It seems like the providence of humans ends here.” Transcendent Immortal was no longer in the mood to watch Zhou Wen’s clumsy performance. Her finger moved slightly in preparation to crack the sword beam and deliver a fatal blow to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>But the moment Transcendent Immortal raised her finger, the seemingly still sword beam suddenly moved.</p>
<p>From extreme stillness to extreme movement, the sword beam struck Transcendent Immortal at a speed indiscernible by the naked eye like a galaxy pouring down.</p>
<p>Rumble!</p>
<p>Sword beams raged as Transcendent Immortal’s body flew out amidst the sword beam and slammed into the hall’s wall.</p>
<p>The infinite stream of swords exploded, instantly turning the entire scene into chaotic sword beam shards. For a moment, nothing could be seen clearly.</p>
<p>After all the light dissipated, people saw Transcendent Immortal embedded in the hall’s wall that had been blasted into by the sword beam.</p>
<p>The armor on her body had cracked, and her face was smeared lightly with blood. Blood was still seeping out of the corners of her mouth.</p>
<p>“Heavens! Transcendent Immortal is injured!” someone exclaimed, almost unable to believe their eyes.</p>
<p>The powerful Transcendent Immortal had actually been injured by Zhou Wen head-on. After watching the two previous battles, such a scene seemed like a dream.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, well done!” Su Yi shouted excitedly.</p>
<p>People also seemed to see a glimmer of hope. The figure standing quietly in front of the hall seemed to give humans hope amidst despair.</p>
<p>“What power is that?” Transcendent Immortal’s body was trapped in the wall as she stared at Zhou Wen and asked.</p>
<p>“The power of the human world,” Zhou Wen replied calmly.</p>
<p>This sentence sounded like Zhou Wen was responding to her mockery of humans, but Zhou Wen didn’t mean that. The power of the human world he was talking about was the Human Realm domain he had obtained after advancing to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Human Realm domain was very simple. Using his own logic to describe it, it could be described by: genuine.</p>
<p>When the human world was genuine, a fantasy without illusions, there would only be a cruel reality.</p>
<p>All rules other than the mortal world’s rules were illusory. It wasn’t determined by human emotions.</p>
<p>To put it simply, all the rules other than the mortal world’s rules were useless in the Human Realm domain.</p>
<p>The power of Transcendent Heaven didn’t belong to the mortal world, so it naturally wasn’t of any use in the Human Realm domain.</p>
<p>However, even Zhou Wen didn’t expect the power of the Human Realm domain to be so effective. Even an Apocalypse-grade powerhouse couldn’t break through its restrictions.</p>
<p>“Impressive. Then, let me see what kind of power the human world has.” Transcendent Immortal’s body slowly escaped the wall. As she moved, the wounds on her body quickly healed. Even her clothes and armor strangely recovered.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Just as Transcendent Immortal escaped, Zhou Wen appeared in front of her as if he had teleported. He punched her chest and blasted her into the depression in the wall again.</p>
<p>A barrage of attacks poured down as shimmering fists crazily struck Transcendent Immortal’s body.</p>
<p>The light blasts constantly flickered. The fluid actions and the feeling of each punch striking flesh was a delightful scene.</p>
<p>Many people couldn’t help but be excited. The seemingly lofty and invincible Transcendent Immortal was actually being steamrolled by Zhou Wen, making their blood boil with excitement.</p>
<p>ч</p>
<p>Before this battle began, nobody had expected such a situation. Nobody expected Transcendent Immortal to be completely defeated by Zhou Wen. It seemed like she didn’t even have the strength to counterattack.</p>
<p>“It’s so brutal… Zhou Wen is so strong…” Su Yi shouted without regard for her image, her voice a little hoarse.</p>
<p>“Beautifully done!” Professor Gu also clenched his fists excitedly.</p>
<p>In the Overseer Manor, An Tianzuo kept frowning and silently watched the scene.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Under Zhou Wen’s crazy bombardment, the hall’s walls finally couldn’t take it any longer. Transcendent Immortal’s body was blasted into the hall like a sandbag, and rubble and dust flew everywhere.</p>
<p>“Maybe… it really will work…” An Sheng stared at the scene and unconsciously clenched his fists, his palms sweating nervously.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1785'>Chapter 1785 New World’s Strength</h3>
<p>After the dust settled, the pupils of the people staring at the scene suddenly constricted, and their eyes involuntarily widened.</p>
<p>Transcendent Immortal slowly walked out of the temple. Her armor was still as bright as new, and her face was flawless. It even had a lustrous glow, making it impossible to tell that she was injured.</p>
<p>It was as if Zhou Wen’s violent attacks had nothing to do with her.</p>
<p>“It’s fake, right? She’s not even injured?” Someone couldn’t believe it and consoled himself.</p>
<p>SC</p>
<p>“How strong is Transcendent Immortal’s physique to not be injured?” Someone had a look of despair.</p>
<p>an</p>
<p>Professor Gu analyzed the situation with a look of disappointment. “From the current situation, Transcendent Immortal has an incomparable self-healing ability. The damage Zhou Wen inflicted on her isn’t as fast as her self-healing speed. I’m afraid there will be a tough battle ahead.”</p>
<p>As people discussed, Transcendent Immortal finally walked out of the temple. She stared at Zhou Wen and slowly said, “Do you know the real difference between an Apocalypse and a Calamity?”</p>
<p>“It’s just possessing the New World,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect you to know about the New World.” Transcendent Immortal’s eyes were cold as she stared at Zhou Wen and continued, “That’s right. The difference between the Apocalypse grade and a Calamity grade is whether one has a New World. However, do you know what a New World is?”</p>
<p>The people watching pricked up their ears. The Apocalypse grade was too distant for humans. No human knew what kind of realm it was. It was better to hear something than not know anything. “It’s just a form of strength,” Zhou Wen said calmly.</p>
<p>“It’s just a form of power? What a bold claim. The ignorant are fearless. A so-called calamity is just a disaster. The world will still be the same after the disaster. However, an apocalypse is different. It’s the power to destroy the old world and establish a new world. It’s the rebuilding of order, the creation of a ruler, and a supreme existence that controls everything.” As her tone gradually became fanatical, the armor on Transcendent Immortal’s body fluttered as if an invisible force was surging out like a volcanic eruption.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression changed slightly because he could sense that the power of the Human Realm domain had lost its binding effect on Transcendent Immortal.</p>
<p>No! Not only was it no longer having a restraining effect, but the entire Human Realm domain was also being destroyed. It quickly collapsed like a rotten palace.</p>
<p>“Everything under the Apocalypse is illusory. Things like Calamity are nothing but dust in my eyes. The old order shall be destroyed, and a new world that belongs to me will be established. You can’t really hurt me, but I can easily destroy the power you’re proud of.” Transcendent Immortal slowly raised her finger and pointed at Zhou Wen as she continued, “You are ultimately nothing but an insignificant speck of dust.”</p>
<p>With that said, a beam of light instantly passed through space-time and landed on Zhou Wen’s forehead, instantly penetrating</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this, everyone felt like they had fallen into an ice cavern.</p>
<p>In their opinion, Transcendent Immortal had actually not used her true strength in the life-and-death battle. She was just playing. Transcendent Immortal—who had now shown the power of the New World—was like a genuine god. It made one unable to have the courage to fight her, leaving only deep despair and fear.</p>
<p>“Without entering the Apocalypse grade… you will ultimately be nothing but dust…” The words didn’t kill, but they threw people to the depths of hell.</p>
<p>Apocalypse… How can there be an apocalypse in the human world?</p>
<p>“So what if it’s dust? To see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower. Even a grain of sand can be in thousands of forms. If you don’t even know this, it seems like the dimension’s Apocalypse grade is just this and nothing much.” A refreshing voice suddenly appeared, but it seemed to jolt the self-pitying people awake.</p>
<p>People suddenly looked up at the scene and were pleasantly surprised to discover that Zhou Wen-who they originally thought had his head blown off by Transcendent Immortal’s finger-had appeared behind Transcendent Immortal at some point in time. His figure had leaped up high, and his right arm stretched back to its limits like a drawn bow. His fist shot out like an arrow.</p>
<p>The ‘Zhou Wen’ that had previously been penetrated by Transcendent Immortal’s finger had already dissipated like smoke. It was only an avatar.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The fist struck the back of Transcendent Immortal’s head, causing her body to fall forward and roll hundreds of meters away before stopping</p>
<p>Transcendent Immortal remained uninjured, but her expression turned extremely nasty.</p>
<p>It could be said that she had been playing when she was beaten up by Zhou Wen. She hadn’t used her true strength at all.</p>
<p>However, it was completely different this time. Although she wasn’t injured, it embarrassed her.</p>
<p>“Haha, stop being a poser? New World? Old World? He’ll torture you to death equally well.” Li Xuan laughed loudly.</p>
<p>“As expected of Coach. I need to take note.” Feng Qiuyan thoughtfully opened up his small notebook and wrote something on it.</p>
<p>“Coach might not be as strong as Transcendent Immortal, but his skills and realm are definitely superior,” Ming Xiu praised.</p>
<p>This punch swept away the previous gloominess, and it also made Ouyang Lanwho was watching the battle in front of the Cube-exhale.</p>
<p>Transcendent Immortal floated up, and the dust on her armor automatically dissipated. She returned to her lofty deity-like appearance from her disheveled appearance.</p>
<p>But this time, people didn’t look at her with the same reverence and fear as before.</p>
<p>As she looked at Zhou Wen, Transcendent Immortal’s eyes were filled with bewilderment.</p>
<p>In her New World, a Calamity grade should’ve completely lost their ability to use orderly powers, but Zhou Wen was completely unaffected. She had never encountered such a situation.</p>
<p>How could Transcendent Immortal know that Zhou Wen wasn’t an ordinary Calamity grade?</p>
<p>Eight types of Calamity Zones had combined into one, helping the Lost Immortal Sutra break through to the Calamity grade. How could the resulting Human Realm domain be an ordinary Calamity Zone?</p>
<p>Although the Human Realm domain couldn’t resist the New World’s power head-on, the New World’s power couldn’t completely destroy it.</p>
<p>At this moment, Zhou Wen had completely restrained the Human Realm domain and fused it with his body. He still maintained the circulation of his strength in Transcendent Immortal’s New World.</p>
<p>“Interesting.” Transcendent Immortal suppressed the anger in her heart and pretended to be calm as she looked at Zhou Wen. “You do have some redeeming qualities. Unfortunately, in the face of absolute strength, all techniques are nothing but a clown’s tricks. Even if I stand here and let you use all your techniques, you won’t be able to harm me at all.”</p>
<p>“Not necessarily.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he slowly drew his two swords. At the same time, his body underwent a strange change.</p>
<p>A mystic crystal-like armor quickly covered Zhou Wen’s body. It was black like an abyss as if it could absorb all light. The armor that tightly wrapped around his muscles outlined his slender and muscular body like a god emperor.</p>
<p>“That’s… Human Sovereign… Zhou Wen is Human Sovereign…” Su Yi’s expression went from confusion to shock, then to pleasant surprise, then to utter alarm. Finally, she screamed, and her voice echoed in the ears of all the humans watching the live broadcast. It was deafening.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1786'>Chapter 1786 Time’s Up</h3>
<p>“Immortal sword?” Transcendent Immortal’s expression changed slightly when she saw the two swords in Zhou Wen’s hands.</p>
<p>She wasn’t sure if the two swords in Zhou Wen’s hands were the ones in her mind, but they made her feel uneasy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what immortal sword Transcendent Immortal was talking about, but he had relied on the Immortal Culling Sword to defeat Perfect Sword Immortal and Berserker Immortal.</p>
<p>The two swords, Immortal Peril and Immortal Culling, seemed to have a powerful restraining effect on the Immortals. Perhaps they could really injure Transcendent Immortal.</p>
<p>As for the armor on Zhou Wen’s body, it was transformed from the Mystic Thearch Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Mystic Thearch was born from absorbing the Big Dipper’s Companion Egg. He had a similar body to Empress Polestar, but there were some differences. The strength of his stats was second only to Demonic Neonate. He was almost on par with Truth Listener.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mystic Thearch had an advantage that Truth Listener didn’t have. His companion form was a soul, allowing him to fuse with Zhou Wen. It allowed Zhou Wen to obtain all his strength and abilities, as well as boost his Constitution. Similarly, it was easier to fully release his powers.</p>
<p>Truth Listener’s earring form could only give Zhou Wen its abilities. Mystic Thearch was more useful in this aspect.</p>
<p>With Su Yi’s shout, even those who didn’t recognize Zhou Wen as Human Sovereign stared at him in shock. They wanted to see if Su Yi was telling the truth.</p>
<p>Soon, everyone confirmed that Zhou Wen was Human Sovereign.</p>
<p>“I never expected Human Sovereign to be Zhou Wen. He’s too young. I thought he would be an immortal hermit!”</p>
<p>“I should have known that there are that many experts among humans. It’s definitely one of them. I just never expected it to be Zhou Wen.”</p>
<p>“I’ve known for a long time that Zhou Wen has the looks of an emperor…”</p>
<p>“Scram!”</p>
<p>In the Wang family’s courtyard, Wang Lu closed her eyes and pressed her palms together in front of her chest as she silently prayed.</p>
<p>She didn’t dare watch the battle in front of the Cube, nor did she dare watch the livestream because her heart couldn’t withstand the unknown outcome.</p>
<p>In the dimension, once defeated, there was only death. There was no chance of escaping.</p>
<p>So he’s Human Sovereign. That makes it even more interesting. In the unknown underwater ancient city, Tsukuyomi, whose white dress was like snow, sat on a chair-sized shell. She held her cheek and looked at Zhou Wen with interest. Her eyes seemed to flicker with a strange light.</p>
<p>Under the attention of everyone, Zhou Wen struck out with both swords and vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>Transcendent Immortal’s figure suddenly vanished. Then, she heard an ear-piercing sound, but she didn’t see anyone.</p>
<p>Occasionally, power would erupt out of thin air, producing a demonic blast of light. After forming the Human Realm domain, the powers of the other eight cultivation techniques had completely fused with Zhou Wen’s body. He could use them as freely as his limbs, elevating it to a higher level.</p>
<p>Godfiend Spacetime’s instant transmission no longer had any restrictions. It could be used in battle without any pause.</p>
<p>The Teacher Domain had already become an instinct, allowing him to sense the other party’s actions and analyze their pros and cons.</p>
<p>Great Brahma’s domain strengthened the body, and the First Order of Chaos augmented his body with external forces.</p>
<p>The Demon God Bloodline Catalog was ever-changing. The Human Sovereign Sacrifices to the Heavens domain made Zhou Wen stronger the more he fought.</p>
<p>Universe Inversion was unpredictable. The Beginningless Sword Domain made the two immortal swords even sharper and indomitable.</p>
<p>These were no longer domains, but a talent or instinct. There was only one true domain, and that was the Human Realm domain.</p>
<p>All the humans watching the battle, including experts like Zhang Chunqiu and Xia Liuchuan, couldn’t see the extent of the battle, nor could they tell who had the upper hand.</p>
<p>Such a battle had exceeded the limits of human understanding. Only a few dimensional Apocalypse-grade experts could see the truth of the battle. It was precisely because they could see it clearly that the bigwigs of the dimensional races were even more alarmed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was undoubtedly only at the Calamity grade. It was unprecedented for a Calamity grade to fight an Apocalypse grade to such an extent.</p>
<p>No matter how powerful a Calamity grade was, they were as weak as dust in front of an Apocalypse grade.</p>
<p>Those Calamity-grade experts who claimed to have killed Apocalypse-grade experts managed to do so through special reasons. They didn’t really kill an Apocalypse-grade expert in a fair battle.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, those Calamity-grade creatures were just chess pieces. The true chess player behind them was still an Apocalypse-grade big shot.</p>
<p>The nature of this battle was completely different. Zhou Wen was a genuine Calamity. Transcendent Immortal wasn’t restrained by any external forces and was at her peak.</p>
<p>Even among Apocalypse-grade experts, Transcendent Immortal was definitely not a run-of-the mill expert.</p>
<p>It was difficult to determine the outcome of the battle between Zhou Wen and Transcendent Immortal despite him being a Calamity. Although Transcendent Immortal had the upper hand, it was enough to shock the bigwigs of the dimension.</p>
<p>“Is the potential of humans really that terrifying? If that human is also at the Apocalypse grade…” At that moment, a thought surfaced in their minds: Humans had to be wiped out. Not a single one could be left alive.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen fell into a dire battle. He had already used all his techniques and even with the augmentation of Mystic Thearch and other Companion Beasts, he could barely fight Transcendent Immortal. He was barely doing anything to her.</p>
<p>The power of the New World is just too powerful. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but sigh. The difference between the Apocalypse grade and the Calamity grade was just too great.</p>
<p>This was all thanks to Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan’s sacrifice. If they hadn’t allowed Zhou Wen to see the essence of Transcendent Immortal’s strength, he probably wouldn’t have been able to put up such a resistance.</p>
<p>There was always someone better. Transcendent Immortal’s New World seemed to be countless spaces interweaving together. Every time Zhou Wen thought that his immortal sword had struck Transcendent Immortal, he would discover that the Transcendent Immortal he had struck was like a bubble. Transcendent Immortal was in a distant space.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Zhou Wen was forced to constantly change his offensive methods. Once he used the same move a second time, he would immediately be counterattacked by Transcendent Immortal.</p>
<p>Even if it was ever-changing, there would always be an end.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen’s sword missed again, a palm suddenly appeared in front of him, preventing him from dodging. All he could do was cross his swords to block the palm. It was as though he had been struck by a sledgehammer.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s legs left deep marks on the square’s ground paved with divine stone as he retreated hundreds of meters before coming to a forceful halt.</p>
<p>His entire calf sank into the stone slabs. In front of him were two deep trenches that had been plowed out. The two swords in his hand kept trembling.</p>
<p>“It’s useless. You aren’t on the same level as me. No matter how hard you work, you can only die in vain.” Transcendent Immortal danced in the air and looked down at Zhou Wen, who was on the ground. She was like an invincible goddess.</p>
<p>In fact, most of the humans watching the battle had no idea what had happened. From their point of view, Zhou Wen and Transcendent Immortal had suddenly vanished for less than a second before Zhou Wen appeared in the square in a sorry state. Then, they heard Transcendent Immortal’s invincible declaration.</p>
<p>“Could it be that even Human Sovereign can’t last a second in front of Transcendent Immortal?” Everyone shuddered.</p>
<p>“The Apocalypse grade is really strong.” Zhou Wen looked at Transcendent Immortal in the sky and praised.</p>
<p>“Since you already know the difference, your time is up. It’s time to go.” Transcendent Immortal pressed down with her palm. It was clearly a slender jade-like hand that was only the size of a palm. It wasn’t even as big as Zhou Wen’s hand, but in the eyes of the world, it managed to blot out the sky. It was like an omnipresent heavenly punishment that contained the might to destroy the world.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1787'>Chapter 1787 In the Human World</h3>
<p>There was only that single palm under the sky.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked up, but all he could see was the palm. It was as if everything in the world was enveloped by that slender hand.</p>
<p>It literally blotted out the sky with one hand, coming from beyond the heavens. Even the heavens seemed like a toy to be manhandled.</p>
<p>There was nowhere to hide, much less escape.</p>
<p>Even the audience could sense the unparalleled pressure from the palm through their television screen. It was as if it was a hand of heaven that could crush them like ants.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was iron-willed. He suddenly swung his left hand and stabbed the Immortal Peril Sword into the ground, holding the hilt of the Immortal Culling Sword with both hands.</p>
<p>The two swords had their own characteristics and could unleash different abilities, but he now needed to gather all his strength for a desperate strike. He couldn’t divert his strength anymore, so he could only give up on one sword and fight with one.</p>
<p>With both hands holding the Immortal Culling Sword, the strength in his body surged into the sword like a tsunami, causing the body of the Immortal Culling Sword to tremble non-stop from the influx of immense power.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew very well that using his strength to fight the peerless strike of Transcendent Immortal head-on was no different from throwing an egg at a rock.</p>
<p>It was the true power of the apocalypse-a power capable of destroying a world.</p>
<p>No matter how powerful a Calamity-grade powerhouse was, they were still limited to the confines of a world. If the world was destroyed, a calamity was nothing.</p>
<p>Only by breaking out of the world will I have a chance of survival. Under the earth-shattering pressure, Zhou Wen looked at her jade-like hand, but his expression was as calm as an ancient well.</p>
<p>After years of cultivation, Zhou Wen’s character had long been tempered to be as tough as steel. Even in the face of death, he could clearly weigh the pros and cons.</p>
<p>Images of his past cultivation flashed through his mind. The persistence of the First Order of Chaos, the artifice of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art, the purity of the Qi Refinement Art, the bizarreness of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, the essence of the Dao Sutra, the illusions of the Godfiend Era, the countering of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra, and the truth of the Demon God Inheritance Catalog.</p>
<p>Yet these paths that he had spent so much effort figuring out were all severed by himself.</p>
<p>There are 50 Great Daos, 49 come from heaven. The one removed is my Dao, and it’s also the Dao of Humanity… Zhou Wen’s heart burned more and more.</p>
<p>As a human, he didn’t need to be indifferent to everything, nor did he need to be one with the world, much less see past the mortal world.</p>
<p>Humans were humans. Since they were born into the world, they should live as themselves. They weren’t doing it for the heavens or the earth; they were only doing it for themselves.</p>
<p>SC</p>
<p>As Transcendent Immortal’s palm pressed down, the entire temple produced cracking sounds. Deep cracks appeared on the eternally indelible wall of divine stones, like pythons intertwined.</p>
<p>The divine mountain trembled as if it would collapse at any moment under the immense pressure of the palm.</p>
<p>The destructive power made people’s hearts palpitate as they stared at the sword-wielding Zhou Wen, the unease in their hearts intensifying despite them praying countless times for him to withstand the palm strike.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s figure and the sword in his hand appeared tiny beneath the palm. They were so small that they were almost negligible.</p>
<p>“Regardless of whether you are Zhou Wen or Human Sovereign, in my opinion, you are nothing more than fleeting clouds. Your life and death are in my hands.” Transcendent Immortal’s voice was like the voice of the Heavenly Dao as it surged from all directions and echoed for a long time, capable of destroying one’s soul.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The huge divine stone pillars outside the temple collapsed one after another under the palm’s pressure like rotten wood shavings.</p>
<p>“To escape the Three Realms and not be confined to the Five Elements, an immortal beyond the heavens is lawless.” The sword in Zhou Wen’s hand lowered as he looked up at the heavens and slowly chanted.</p>
<p>“Not bad. To be able to understand the true gap between you and me, I guess you can die in peace,” Transcendent Immortal said calmly as she continued pressing down with her palm, about to crush Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, that’s only your delusion. It’s sad and lamentable. If there’s still an area beyond the heavens, it won’t be that. So what if you’ve escaped the Three Realms and not confined to the Five Elements? I’ll let you know that you’re still… in… the human… world.” As he spoke, Zhou Wen held the Immortal Culling Sword with both hands and counterattacked with a mighty strike.</p>
<p>As the Immortal Culling Sword rose, Zhou Wen’s body and sword emitted light. It wasn’t intense, but it was dazzling.</p>
<p>It was like a phoenix that had been reborn from fire and was undergoing a transformation. With the appearance of the light, Zhou Wen and the sword underwent a transformation, but it also seemed to be burning. When the sword tore through space and met Transcendent Immortal’s palm, Zhou Wen’s body and sword seemed to have completely turned into light, turning into a blazing white projection.</p>
<p>When the sword and palm collided, there was no dazzling explosion of light, nor was there a shockwave that tore through everything. There were no sparks as expected, nor was there an earth-shattering collapse.</p>
<p>The blade struck the flesh, slicing open the flesh on his palm, and blood flowed down the blade.</p>
<p>“I-impossible…” Transcendent Immortal’s face twisted, and her eyes were filled with shock and disbelief.</p>
<p>The full-powered strike of an Apocalypse-grade force was actually cracked open by Zhou Wen. She couldn’t accept such a ridiculous outcome, regardless.</p>
<p>Transcendent Immortal’s five fingers suddenly contracted as she gripped the sword, allowing the flesh on her five fingers to be sliced open. The blade sank into her bones, and blood splattered.</p>
<p>She struck out with her other hand again, hoping to kill him on the spot.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already prepared and was about to forcefully summon Demonic Neonate to help him withstand the fatal strike.</p>
<p>But before Zhou Wen could summon Demonic Neonate, Transcendent Immortal’s palm suddenly stopped. Her pupils constricted strangely as if she had encountered something unexpected and extremely terrifying</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s gaze went past Transcendent Immortal’s face and saw a familiar face.</p>
<p>“Teacher…” Zhou Wen was slightly stunned.</p>
<p>The white-robed person behind Transcendent Immortal was none other than Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>At this moment, Wang Mingyuan had a calm expression and was filled with vigor. He didn’t look like he was about to die from his serious injuries at all. He stood behind Transcendent Immortal and pressed a palm on her head. His five fingers were like hooks that stabbed into her skull.</p>
<p>Although he couldn’t see anything, Zhou Wen could sense that the strength in Transcendent Immortal was rapidly flowing away.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, Zhou Wen couldn’t sense the strength coming from Transcendent Immortal’s hand that was gripping the sword.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared blankly at Transcendent Immortal and Wang Mingyuan behind her. He saw that the former’s vitality was almost drained, and her entire body hung down like an old willow branch in the wind. If Wang Mingyuan hadn’t grabbed her head, she would’ve probably fallen to the ground.</p>
<p>“You… You…” Like a dying old man who couldn’t even speak properly, Transcendent Immortal weakly said the word ‘you’ before her head suddenly exploded like a watermelon.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan’s fingers were stained with blood as he looked at the headless corpse as if he were looking at trash. “Zhou Wen, you did well.” Wang Mingyuan took out a white handkerchief and wiped the blood off his fingers, allowing the white handkerchief to drift away with the wind. Then, he smiled at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the damaged temple, and his expression changed drastically when he saw the situation.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1788'>Chapter 1788 Something Unusual</h3>
<p>Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan, who were imprisoned on the stone pillar, had already turned into two dried corpses. Their flesh was shriveled like dried bacon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Wang Mingyuan with a gloomy expression. He hoped that Wang Mingyuan could give him an explanation, hoping that the truth wasn’t what he thought.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan sighed softly and said, “Some sacrifices are inevitable to do what needs to be done.”</p>
<p>With that said, Zhou Wen felt as though he had fallen into an ice cavern as his body trembled uncontrollably.</p>
<p>“They risked their lives to come here for you.” Zhou Wen’s voice trembled uncontrollably.</p>
<p>“Therefore, I want them to die for a reason,” Wang Mingyuan said.</p>
<p>“You were plotting against them from the beginning?” Zhou Wen still had a sliver of hope as he asked Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>“It’s not just them. Including you, I chose all my students because you guys have the talent I need.” Wang Mingyuan’s honesty left Zhou Wen speechless.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Wang Mingyuan in silence. Jiang Yan treated Wang Mingyuan like a mentor in life, and Zhong Ziya treated Wang Mingyuan like a father.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Wen himself treated Wang Mingyuan as a good teacher worthy of respect.</p>
<p>However, he never expected that Wang Mingyuan had been plotting against them from the beginning.</p>
<p>“If you want to do something extraordinary, you have to use extreme means. I had no other choice,” Wang Mingyuan said indifferently.</p>
<p>“What about Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan? Didn’t they have other choices as well? But they chose you,” Zhou Wen said coldly as he looked at Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>“They chose me, but I chose the entire world. There’s no contradiction,” Wang Mingyuan said.</p>
<p>“Teacher, this is the last time I’ll call you that. I hope you won’t regret your choice in the future,” Zhou Wen said as he turned to leave.</p>
<p>“You can leave, but leave the two swords behind.” Wang Mingyuan stopped Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What if I say no?” Zhou Wen stopped but didn’t turn his head.</p>
<p>“I’ve already lost two disciples. I don’t wish to lose a third.” Wang Mingyuan sighed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored Wang Mingyuan and walked to the side of the Immortal Peril Sword, about to pull it out.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan waved his sleeve gently as a force surged towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen slashed out with his backhand at the surging undercurrent, but it was as though he had struck a spring.</p>
<p>His powerful force was completely absorbed before it erupted, sending Zhou Wen flying.</p>
<p>In midair, he felt the hand holding the Immortal Culling Sword tremble as it uncontrollably left his hand. When Zhou Wen stabilized himself and looked again, he saw that the Immortal Peril Sword and Immortal Culling Sword were already in Wang Mingyuan’s hands.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gathered his strength as his fists erupted with infinite strength as he struck at Wang Mingyuan. However, Wang Mingyuan, who was inches away, seemed to be in another world. No matter how ferocious his punches were, they couldn’t injure Wang Mingyuan at all.</p>
<p>It was the power of Transcendent Immortal, but not completely. It was even stranger than Transcendent Immortal’s powers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew very well that it was impossible for him to defeat Wang Mingyuan today.</p>
<p>This was because the current Wang Mingyuan wasn’t only Wang Mingyuan. Not only did he have the power of Transcendent Immortal, but the attack he used to snatch the swords previously had the inklings of Jiang Yan and Zhong Ziya, perhaps even more.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan could use external forces for his own. Zhong Ziya could infinitely stimulate his evolution. Such talent and ability were now used by Wang Mingyuan. Furthermore, he had successfully advanced to the Apocalypse grade after absorbing the power of Transcendent Immortal.</p>
<p>Ignoring Zhou Wen, even in the dimension, it was difficult to say if anyone could defeat him.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan ignored Zhou Wen as his hands moved slightly. The Immortal Peril Sword and Immortal Culling Sword rose up as two other swords flew out of Wang Mingyuan’s sleeve.</p>
<p>The four swords had different shapes, but they gave off a mysterious feeling.</p>
<p>In the next second, the four swords gathered together. At the instant they collided, they fused into one, turning into a sword that floated beneath Wang Mingyuan’s feet.</p>
<p>“If we can meet again, everything will end.” Wang Mingyuan glanced at Zhou Wen before turning around and riding the sword away. The white-robed sword shadow vanished into the horizon in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked in the direction Wang Mingyuan had vanished with a complicated expression. Finally, he could only smile bitterly and walk towards Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan’s skeletons.</p>
<p>“Let’s… go home…” Zhou Wen carried the two skeletons and left the divine mountain, feeling mixed emotions.</p>
<p>After returning to Guide Ancient City, Zhou Wen buried Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan’s corpses on a hill outside the city. He looked at their tombstones and was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>“F*ck, Wang Mingyuan is really a piece of trash. I’ve never seen such a shameless person. You guys risked your lives for him, but he still schemed against all of you. He’s inhumane. Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan’s deaths weren’t worth it,” Li Xuan said angrily.</p>
<p>“That’s their choice. At the very least, they met it calmly in death,” Zhou Wen said slowly.</p>
<p>“What bullsh*t calmness? Do you know what people are saying now?” Li Xuan hesitated.</p>
<p>Even if Zhou Wen didn’t know, he could guess what people would say.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter what they say. The dead can’t be revived.” Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to care about what others said.</p>
<p>“Well said. The dead hold the least value. Why don’t you put some thought into saving your life?” A hoarse voice sounded.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan turned their heads and saw an elder walking over with a strange smile.</p>
<p>“Jing Daoxian? What are you doing here?” Zhou Wen asked the elder with a frown.</p>
<p>“I’m here to save your lives, of course,” Jing Daoxian said with a faint smile.</p>
<p>“You should save your life first,” Li Xuan said coldly.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian thought nothing of it. He walked to the tombstone and said with infinite regret, “What a pity.”</p>
<p>“What about?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, their powers weren’t used by me. Otherwise, the dimensional king wouldn’t be Wang Mingyuan, but me.” Jing Daoxian sighed. “What do you mean?” Li Xuan asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“Kid, are you really stupid or are you pretending to be stupid? Why did Wang Mingyuan do so many things? With the ability to infinitely evolve and transform all powers for his own use, coupled with the power of Transcendent Immortal helping him advance to the Apocalypse grade, what else could it be for? Just watch. If he doesn’t die, he will soon become the king who controls the entire dimension,” Jing Daoxian said with a twitch of his lips.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already roughly guessed it, but Li Xuan’s mouth gaped open in surprise. After a while, he said, “From what you’re saying, Wang Mingyuan wants to turn himself into a devil. To subdue the devils as a devil sounds rather tragic.”</p>
<p>“Hehe, I’m just afraid that he will end up becoming the most lethal devil king,” Jing Daoxian said with a sneer.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“What do I mean… Hehe… I’m afraid Wang Mingyuan hates humans more than the monsters from the dimension…” Jing Daoxian said with a strange laugh..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1789'>Chapter 1789 Mythical Divide</h3>
<p>“Why?” Li Xuan asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“What do you think is the greatest disaster for humans after the dimension’s descent?” Jing Daoxian asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“Of course it’s those terrifying dimensional creatures,” Li Xuan said matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>“You’re still too young,” Jing Daoxian said with a pout.</p>
<p>“Stop putting on an act. What else can it be?” Li Xuan retorted indignantly.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian glanced at Li Xuan and narrowed his eyes. “If two countries were to fight and your family ended up getting killed, do you think it would be more unacceptable if your family was killed by the enemy or betrayed by your own people?”</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s heart skipped a beat. “You mean that Wang Mingyuan has been betrayed by his own people?”</p>
<p>“Hehe, it’s worse than that.” Jing Daoxian chuckled coldly. “Since ancient times, the most despairing thing in every calamity isn’t the calamity itself. The human heart is often crueler than a calamity.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, who had been silent, suddenly recalled the question Wang Mingyuan had asked them.</p>
<p>If the person you loved the most was insulted and he didn’t have the strength to resist the enemy, would he choose to fight at the risk of his life or endure the humiliation and join the enemy to seek revenge?</p>
<p>Back then, Zhou Wen had believed that the enemy Wang Mingyuan mentioned was the dimensional creatures. From the looks of it, if Jing Daoxian wasn’t fooling them, the enemy Wang Mingyuan mentioned might not be the dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>“Old fellow, can you not speak in riddles? If you have anything to say, just say it.” Li Xuan’s curiosity was piqued.</p>
<p>“I also want to make it clear, but unfortunately, I’m not sure,” Jing Daoxian said slowly.</p>
<p>“After all this time, you don’t know anything, and here you are bullsh*ting!” Li Xuan said unhappily.</p>
<p>“Even I have to admire a shrewd person like Wang Mingyuan. I don’t know much about him, but according to my investigations, he was once married and had children. Have you heard him mention them?” Jing Daoxian wasn’t angry as he continued speaking slowly.</p>
<p>“That’s impossible. Wang Mingyuan has never been married, much less had children. Everyone knows that,” Li Xuan immediately retorted.</p>
<p>“You’re free to believe anything you want. It’s not the first time I’ve worked with him. This is all I’ve found out. I can say with certainty that he had a wife and children, but they’re gone now,” Jing Daoxian said indifferently.</p>
<p>Before Li Xuan could say anything else, Jing Daoxian continued, “Actually, it doesn’t matter if it’s real or fake. You will know the outcome soon.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew what Jing Daoxian meant. If it was really as Jing Daoxian had said, that Wang Mingyuan once had family and they had been harmed by humans, then once Wang Mingyuan became the ruler of the dimension, he would definitely return to Earth to do something</p>
<p>“How do you want to cooperate?” Zhou Wen stared at Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>“Wang Mingyuan’s strength is probably invincible. There’s only one way to restrain him.” Jing Daoxian enunciated each word clearly. “Chess Mountain.”</p>
<p>When he heard the words “Chess Mountain,” Zhou Wen’s heart stirred.</p>
<p>Back then, he had made two bets with The Thearch. One of the bets was proposed by Zhou Wen. The two of them bet that Zhou Wen would live longer than The Thearch. This bet was still ongoing.</p>
<p>Another bet was that Zhou Wen would regret killing Transcendent Immortal. From the looks of it, Zhou Wen had lost the bet.</p>
<p>He did regret killing Transcendent Immortal. The Thearch had actually predicted this outcome back then. It was obvious that she had long seen through Wang Mingyuan’s scheme.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen really wanted to ask The Thearch why Wang Mingyuan was doing this, but he didn’t.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already lost the first bet. If he went to see The Thearch now, she could kill him and win the second bet.</p>
<p>Therefore, Chess Mountain was undoubtedly the most dangerous place for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian had now mentioned Chess Mountain. Countless thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind.</p>
<p>“Why Chess Mountain?” Zhou Wen stared at Jing Daoxian and asked.</p>
<p>“Because it’s very likely to have the answer that everyone wants. The answer regarding the dimension,” Jing Daoxian continued. “If you are careful enough, you should be able to tell that there’s a very clear watershed in ancient myths. It’s before and after the Shang dynasty.”</p>
<p>“What’s the difference?” Li Xuan didn’t understand what Jing Daoxian meant.</p>
<p>“Lad, read more when you have the time,” Jing Daoxian said disdainfully. “In the myths before the Shang dynasty, be it Pangu, Nüwa, or the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, the relationship between humans and gods was equal. And after the Shang dynasty, immortals became high and mighty. The status of humans plummeted. Even the emperors of the human world called themselves the Son of Heaven. To put it nicely, they were under the orders of the heavens and had destinies determined by the heavens. To put it bluntly, they were the representatives designated by the gods. They were just lackeys. After the Shang dynasty, there was no human king.”</p>
<p>“What has this got to do with the dimension?” Li Xuan was still puzzled.</p>
<p>“Apart from Chess Mountain, have you seen any of the dimensional zones on Earth before the Zhou dynasty?” Jing Daoxian asked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were taken aback. They had never seen dimensional zones before the Zhou dynasty.</p>
<p>“The dimensional zones on Earth can be related to myths and legends, but have you seen dimensional zones related to mighty figures like Pangu, Nüwa, Hou Yi, and Kuafu? The connection between all dimensional zones and myths ends at the Shang dynasty. It’s as though they have been sliced into two…” Jing Daoxian’s eyes were fervent. “The source of everything lies in the Shang dynasty, and Chess Mountain is the origins of the Shang dynasty. It’s here where we can solve the mystery of all of this. Perhaps we can obtain what we want.”</p>
<p>“After all that talk, this is just an unfounded guess.” Li Xuan curled his lips and continued, “I remember that Feng Qiuyan’s hometown has dimensional zones related to Human Ancestor Fuxi. Guide also has Human Sovereign Suirenshi’s dimensional zone. These are all myths from before the Shang dynasty.”</p>
<p>“Suirenshi is a human, not a myth. As for Fuxi, he’s probably inextricably linked to Chess Mountain,” Jing Daoxian said.</p>
<p>“That’s a little ridiculous. Do you really think I’m uneducated? What has Fuxi got to do with Chess Mountain?” Li Xuan said disdainfully.</p>
<p>“Then tell me, who started the war that destroyed the Shang dynasty?” Jing Daoxian asked.</p>
<p>“Nüwa.”</p>
<p>“What’s the relationship between Nüwa and Fuxi?” Jing Daoxian asked again.</p>
<p>“I think they’re siblings?” Li Xuan said with some uncertainty.</p>
<p>“Some say siblings, others say husband and wife—no matter which one it is, it means that the relationship between the two isn’t simple. And all the ancient myths stop at the Shang dynasty. The only one that can be tied to ancient mythology is the Shang dynasty. Why is that?” Jing Daoxian said seriously, “Perhaps we can obtain the answer after cracking Chess Mountain.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1790'>Chapter 1790 Telling a Love Story</h3>
<p>Although Jing Daoxian wasn’t the type to spout words of wisdom and his words weren’t pleasant, everything he said was very alluring. He even raised the possibility that Chess Mountain might be related to Earth’s Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the conversation, Zhou Wen could only say that he would consider it and didn’t give Jing Daoxian an accurate answer.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian looked confident as though he was certain that Zhou Wen would cooperate with him. After giving Zhou Wen his contact details, he staggered away.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, do you think that old fellow, Jing Daoxian, is fooling us? He doesn’t sound reliable no matter how I look at it. Is Chess Mountain really related to Earth’s Companion Beast? Can we determine that Chess Mountain is related to Earth’s Companion Beast just because it’s the watershed in ancient mythology? Isn’t that too far-fetched?” Li Xuan whispered after Jing Daoxian left.</p>
<p>“With his character, if Jing Daoxian dares to take the risk at Chess Mountain, he must have some confidence. He definitely hasn’t been entirely truthful.” Zhou Wen also knew that Jing Daoxian definitely didn’t have any good intentions. Regardless of whether Chess Mountain was related to Earth’s Companion Beast, Jing Daoxian only wanted to use them.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had his own considerations, so he didn’t directly reject Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>He had to go to Chess Mountain. Even if he didn’t go, The Thearch definitely wouldn’t let him off. If he could pull Jing Daoxian along, it was hard to say who would be cannon fodder.</p>
<p>“No matter how I think about it, this matter doesn’t seem right. Even if what Jing Daoxian said makes sense, that Chess Mountain is a watershed in ancient mythology. It might not have anything to do with Earth’s Companion Beast. Furthermore, Chess Mountain is only a watershed in eastern myths. How do you explain the myths in other regions?” Li Xuan pondered.</p>
<p>“There’s no such thing as a watershed in the myths of the other regions. From the source, the myths of the other regions have always been about the supremacy of the divine. Gods are rulers to begin with. There’s no such thing as a watershed,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>Li Xuan thought about it carefully and realized that it was true. The few Mythical systems in the world were basically theocracies. There was nothing involving humans.</p>
<p>“In short, I don’t think that old fellow is reliable. The things regarding Wang Mingyuan are most likely unreliable,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“We’ll eventually get the answers whether it’s true or not, but I have to make a trip to Chess Mountain.” Zhou Wen told Li Xuan about Chess Mountain, and Li Xuan also understood why Zhou Wen had to go to Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>“There’s actually such a sick creature on Earth. Isn’t it even more terrifying than the dimension’s Apocalypse?” Li Xuan jumped in fright when he heard The Thearch’s omnipotent wish power.</p>
<p>“At the very least, from what I’ve sensed, she’s definitely not weaker than Transcendent Immortal.” Zhou Wen sighed.</p>
<p>“Then why are you going? Aren’t you sending yourself to your death?” Li Xuan shouted.</p>
<p>“She won’t let me off even if I don’t go. I can sense that after the bet, there’s an inexplicable connection between us. I can’t escape.” Zhou Wen smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>“That f*cking sucks!” Li Xuan was rendered speechless.</p>
<p>Not long after returning to the ancient city, a message appeared on Zhou Wen’s phone. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be taken aback when he saw the sender and content of the message. “Little Wenwen, I’m back in Luoyang. Come to Luoyang when you have the time. It’s been a long time since I had a good chat with you.” The sender was Zhou Wen’s father, Zhou Lingfeng</p>
<p>Zhou Wen replied before heading to Luoyang’s An family.</p>
<p>He hadn’t seen Zhou Lingfeng in a long time. He could also take the opportunity to visit Ya’er in Luoyang.</p>
<p>Luoyang in March remained a little chilly. When the wind blew on his face, there was a knife-like coldness.</p>
<p>In front of the An family’s mansion, a man in a white military uniform and a large cloak stood at the door, his face expressionless.</p>
<p>Behind him stood a smiling man, and in front of him was a beautiful girl who looked like a doll.</p>
<p>The girl didn’t say a word when she saw Zhou Wen. She shook off the man’s hand that was holding hers and ran to Zhou Wen. She threw herself into his arms and hugged his neck tightly.</p>
<p>“Ya’er.” Zhou Wen picked up Yaler and gently stroked her head. His originally impetuous mood seemed to calm down significantly.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen,” An Sheng greeted with a smile.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could answer, he heard An Tianzuo say indifferently, “Uncle Zhou and Mom are waiting for you inside for dinner.” Zhou Wen nodded at An Sheng and carried Ya’er into the An family residence.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan was the same as before. She didn’t seem to have changed much, but Zhou Lingfeng looked much older than before.</p>
<p>Although he still looked as refined and casual as before, there were many white hairs around his temples.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan warmly invited Zhou Wen to sit down. An Jing also sat by the side. Their eyes met, but neither of them said a word.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s present state of mind was completely different from when he first arrived in Luoyang. He had this meal in comfort.</p>
<p>He no longer cared about the thoughts and views of others. He had his own principles. He treated the kind with kindness, and returned with a fist to those who were malicious. There was no need to blame himself or pity himself.</p>
<p>“Little Wenwen, have a cup of tea with me. It’s been a long time since we sat down for a chat.” After the meal, Zhou Lingfeng called Zhou Wen over and the two of them went to the small garden in the backyard.</p>
<p>A pot of tea and two people. Under the cold moonlight, steam from the tea rose.</p>
<p>Zhou Lingfeng picked up the teacup and took a sip. After putting down the teacup, he suddenly said something Zhou Wen had never expected. “Have you been to Xiyuan Store?”</p>
<p>“How did you know?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.</p>
<p>Zhou Lingfeng didn’t answer as he continued, “Have you seen that silver-haired Companion Beast? How does it feel?”</p>
<p>“What feeling?” Zhou Wen felt that Zhou Lingfeng’s question was out of the blue. He didn’t know what he was referring to.</p>
<p>“My Companion Beast isn’t bad, right?” Zhou Lingfeng asked again with a smile.</p>
<p>Pfft!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen spat out the mouthful of tea he had just drunk.</p>
<p>He stared at Zhou Lingfeng with widened eyes and said in disbelief, “What did you say? That silver-haired Companion Beast is your Companion Beast?”</p>
<p>He never expected Zhou Lingfeng to say such words. In fact, he still found it unbelievable despite hearing it with his own ears.</p>
<p>“Why? Is it difficult to accept that I have a Companion Beast?” Zhou Lingfeng said with a faint smile.</p>
<p>“It’s not difficult to accept you having a Companion Beast, but that Companion Beast…” Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss for words.</p>
<p>“He’s indeed different. He can be said to be my Companion Beast, but also not,” Zhou Lingfeng said calmly.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? Isn’t that silver-haired Companion Beast the former principal’s… which is your current father-in-law?” Zhou Wen was filled with puzzlement.</p>
<p>“You’re right. He was indeed separated from me by Father-in-law,” Zhou Lingfeng said with a nod.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” The more Zhou Wen heard, the more confused he became.</p>
<p>“It’s a long story. I have to tell you a story. It’s a touching love story.” Zhou Lingfeng took a sip of tea as though he was immersed in his memories. He also seemed somewhat nostalgic and smug.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1791'>Chapter 1791 Shattered Values</h3>
<p>“Are you sure that you are telling a touching love story? Not a modern tea art story?” Zhou Wen looked at Zhou Lingfeng, who seemed extremely touched by his own story, with an extremely odd expression.</p>
<p>Zhou Lingfeng’s story was complicated, but it was very simple to summarize.</p>
<p>It was a story of a male scumbag with a wife and a female scumbag with a childhood sweetheart fiancé who hit it off at first sight. They got together shamelessly after abandoning their respective wife and husband.</p>
<p>When Zhou Lingfeng told the story, he was so moved by his own story that tears welled up in his eyes. However, no matter how Zhou Wen listened, he felt his values crumble. There were a few instances when he nearly couldn’t help himself from strangling Zhou Lingfeng</p>
<p>Zhou Lingfeng’s wife and Ouyang Lan were best friends, and Ouyang Lan was already engaged to the An family.</p>
<p>In the end, it was because they had invited Zhou Lingfeng and his wife to their place as guests and hang out together and attend their wedding that something happened.</p>
<p>The male scumbag flirted with his wife’s bestie and eloped with the bride before the wedding began. The female scumbag became pregnant with some random guy’s child and returned to marry her fiancé.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt his nerves being hammered again and again. He stood there in a daze as he looked at Zhou Lingfeng with his mouth agape.</p>
<p>“So, An Tianzuo and I are really half-brothers?” Zhou Wen’s voice sounded odd.</p>
<p>His mother had passed away early. It was hard to tell if she had been angered to death by this adulterous couple.</p>
<p>“Ahem, Little Wenwen, you’re good at everything, but your EQ is too low.” Zhou Lingfeng coughed lightly and said something that completely shattered Zhou Wen’s worldview. “Why can’t you be brothers from the same parents?”</p>
<p>Pfft! This time, Zhou Wen really couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of tea at Zhou Lingfeng</p>
<p>Zhou Lingfeng didn’t mind at all. He picked up a towel to wipe his face and continued, “The situation back then was a little complicated. If Lan’s second child was still a boy, she would have to bear some of the old scores of the An family’s previous generation. The situation wasn’t good. How could I let our son suffer? Coincidentally, your mother had just given birth to a girl… So…”</p>
<p>“Are you saying that An Jing is my mom’s child and I’m supposed to be f*cking An Jing?” Zhou Wen’s worldview had already shattered into pieces as he spoke incoherently.</p>
<p>“Although what you said isn’t exactly accurate, it’s roughly that,” Zhou Lingfeng said with a nod.</p>
<p>“Didn’t the An family have any doubts?” Zhou Wen refused to believe that the An family knew nothing about such matters given their capabilities.</p>
<p>“The adult world is complicated. The An family was in trouble both internally and externally. They needed someone to inherit the family business. That brother also needed an heir, but he didn’t have the ability,” Zhou Lingfeng said as he drank his tea.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was speechless for a long time before saying, “Auntie… Lan… Does she know?”</p>
<p>Zhou Lingfeng shook his head. “She doesn’t know that I secretly swapped you. She has always thought that An Jing is her biological daughter. You have to keep this matter to yourself. You can’t tell anyone, much less let Little Jing know.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s mind was already in a mess. He was momentarily in a daze, wondering if he was dreaming</p>
<p>“Why are you suddenly telling me this?” he asked with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>“What you’re doing now is too dangerous. It’s hard to say if you can return alive in the future. I can’t let you die without knowing who your biological mother is, right?” Zhou Lingfeng sighed.</p>
<p>“What’s with the silver-haired Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“I’ve told you about how your grandfather dug up that phone in the ancient well. However, there was something else that was dug out with the phone-a silver Companion Egg.” Zhou Lingfeng sank into his memories again.</p>
<p>After Zhou Lingfeng’s recount, Zhou Wen learned the complete story.</p>
<p>Back then, Zhou Wen’s grandfather had dug up the box containing the phone and the silver Companion Egg and brought them home that day.</p>
<p>Back then, phones were already quite common, but it couldn’t be switched on. As for the Companion Egg, no one knew what Companion Eggs were back then. He only considered it a strange egg, so he didn’t pay much attention to it and casually placed it on the table at home.</p>
<p>Zhou Lingfeng was young back then, so he used the Companion Egg in the box as a ball.</p>
<p>It was unknown what Zhou Lingfeng had done to hatch the Companion Egg, but the silver Companion Beast became Zhou Lingfeng’s Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Zhou Lingfeng had only been a few years old and had never cultivated. How could he withstand the energy drain needed to hatch a Companion Beast? It was a miracle he hadn’t died.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Lingfeng still fell seriously ill and fell into a coma for several days.</p>
<p>Back then, Zhou Wen’s grandfather sought treatment everywhere with Zhou Lingfeng, but there was no solution.</p>
<p>It was Zhou Wen’s grandfather who had thought of something. He brought the remaining box and phone to get someone to appraise them. He wanted to know where the items came from. Perhaps he could figure out the origins of the silver Companion Egg and save Zhou Lingfeng.</p>
<p>The person Zhou Wen’s grandfather had found was the young Ouyang Ting.</p>
<p>Although Ouyang Ting was very young back then, he was already quite accomplished in archeology. His appraisal indicated that the box containing the phone was from the Shang/Zhou dynasty.</p>
<p>However, phones didn’t exist during that era. How could it appear in a box from the Shang dynasty?</p>
<p>They originally imagined that it was put in by someone later on, but after studying it, all the test results indicated that the phone had been passed down from the Shang/Zhou dynasty over thousands of years with the box.</p>
<p>From then on, Ouyang Ting began studying such matters, hoping to solve the mystery.</p>
<p>After some time, Zhou Lingfeng recovered by himself. However, because he had too little energy, he couldn’t activate the silver-haired Companion Beast and summon him.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until the dimensional storms and Ouyang Ting’s subsequent research that Zhou Lingfeng was able to summon the silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<p>According to Zhou Lingfeng, unlike ordinary Companion Beasts, the silver-haired Companion Beast was like a child about Zhou Lingfeng’s age when it first appeared. It looked very childish and cute.</p>
<p>As Zhou Lingfeng grew up, the silver-haired Companion Beast also grew up. This surprised Ouyang Ting and company.</p>
<p>After the dimensions appeared, some people obtained Companion Beasts, but they were completely different from Zhou Lingfeng’s Companion Beast. The silver-haired Companion Beast had too many strange traits.</p>
<p>The reason Zhou Lingfeng learned the various languages and ancient texts was that his goal was the same as Ouyang Ting’s. He wanted to unravel the secrets of the box, phone, and silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<p>A phone that had been passed down from the Shang/Zhou dynasty was impossible, but it still happened. Zhou Lingfeng had been to countless ruins dating to the Shang and Zhou dynasties. He had read many ancient books and information, but all of them indicated that there were no phones during those times.</p>
<p>“Could transmigration really exist?” Back then, Zhou Lingfeng and Ouyang Ting had similar questions, but they quickly rejected this thought.</p>
<p>If transmigration really existed, even if it was extremely unlikely, it was impossible for it to only happen once. Over the endless years, there would definitely be more people and objects that transmigrated.</p>
<p>However, reality proved that other than this phone, there was no real physical evidence of any other suspected transmigration incidents. Furthermore, many of them were confirmed to be fake.</p>
<p>Until one day, the silver-haired Companion Beast suddenly awakened.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1792'>Chapter 1792 Approaching the Truth</h3>
<p>“Chess Mountain?” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown after hearing Zhou Lingfeng’s description.</p>
<p>Back then, Zhou Lingfeng had taken the silver-haired Companion Beast around the entire East District. The silver-haired Companion Beast just looked like a growing Companion Beast without any knowledge.</p>
<p>Zhou Lingfeng stood in front of the mountain and didn’t venture deep when he went to Chess Mountain. The silver-haired Companion Beast suddenly awakened some unknown knowledge and memories.</p>
<p>The knowledge and memories seemed to be deeply engraved in his genes. He was just waiting for an opportunity to awaken.</p>
<p>Zhou Lingfeng had felt that something was amiss. He immediately retreated without entering the mountain and watched from afar.</p>
<p>Even so, many strange things happened after that. The silver-haired Companion Beast’s soul seemed to change. His personality was completely different from before.</p>
<p>If not for the fact that Companion Beasts couldn’t harm their masters, Zhou Lingfeng would have long died at the hands of the silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<p>In order to survive, Zhou Lingfeng went to Ouyang Ting again. With Ouyang Ting’s help, he transferred the silver-haired Companion Beast to him.</p>
<p>He never expected Ouyang Ting to encounter danger a few times before imprisoning the silver-haired Companion Beast in Xiyuan Store.</p>
<p>However, according to what Zhou Lingfeng knew, during the years when Ouyang Ting had the silver-haired Companion Beast, his personality became very strange. He often vanished without a trace, disappearing for months or even a year or two.</p>
<p>As for where Ouyang Ting had been during that period of time, Zhou Lingfeng didn’t know. However, there was one time when Ouyang Ting sent a message to Zhou Lingfeng. His tone was very excited as though he had made a major discovery.</p>
<p>However, the content of the message was somewhat incomprehensible. Zhou Lingfeng didn’t understand what it meant.</p>
<p>Later on, Ouyang Ting vanished for a period of time. When he appeared again, he had already returned to normal. He didn’t mention that matter again. The silver-haired Companion Beast was also sealed in Xiyuan Store.</p>
<p>“What was the message the former principal sent you?” Zhou Wen asked Zhou Lingfeng.</p>
<p>“I’m already close to the truth. I’ll soon know the ultimate secret of humanity,” Zhou Lingfeng said.</p>
<p>“The truth… The ultimate secret of humanity… And then?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“That’s all. I sent a message asking, but Ouyang Ting didn’t reply.” Zhou Lingfeng sighed.</p>
<p>The two of them chatted about some matters related to Ouyang Ting and the silver-haired Companion Beast, but they failed to get the gist of anything. Zhou Lingfeng failed to provide any more useful information.</p>
<p>After leaving the An family, Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that something was amiss, but he couldn’t put his finger on it.</p>
<p>Zhou Lingfeng seemed to be revealing everything without holding back, but for some reason, Zhou Wen still felt that something was wrong.</p>
<p>What’s wrong? Zhou Wen carefully recalled, but he couldn’t figure out what was wrong. He only subconsciously felt that Zhou Lingfeng’s tone was a little odd.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, if I want to know the truth, I have to start with that silver-haired Companion Beast. Zhou Wen planned on making another trip to Xiyuan Store to meet the silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<p>The phone, the silver-haired Companion Beast, Chess Mountain, and The Thearch. Perhaps only the silver-haired Companion Beast and The Thearch could give him an answer.</p>
<p>The last time he went to Xiyuan Store, Zhou Wen had remained very careful. This time, he didn’t spend much effort to surreptitiously arrive at the place where the silver-haired Companion Beast was imprisoned.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen appeared in the chamber, the silver-haired Companion Beast that seemed to be asleep with its eyes closed seemed to sense something. It slowly opened its eyes and looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“You’re here.” The silver-haired Companion Beast’s tone was odd as though he had expected Zhou Wen to come.</p>
<p>“What are you?” Zhou Wen asked the silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“Just a Companion Beast,” the silver-haired Companion Beast answered indifferently.</p>
<p>“Whose Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen naturally didn’t believe such nonsense. Previously, the silver-haired Companion Beast had said that he was only a Terror-grade Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“If you want to know the answer, you can try opening it.” The silver-haired Companion Beast pointed at the metal slab connected to the chain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had always guessed that the passcode left behind by the former principal was to open the metal slab. He just hadn’t dared to attempt it in the past.</p>
<p>“If you want me to open it, you have to at least give me a reason,” Zhou Wen said as he stared at the silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“Life or death, is that a choice?” the silver-haired Companion Beast said with a</p>
<p>sneer.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“Her wish mark has already been left on you. If you want to live, it’s your only chance,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Who is she?” Zhou Wen was alarmed. He already knew who the silver-haired Companion Beast was referring to, but he still had to confirm the answer.</p>
<p>“Who else can leave a wish mark on an existence like you who can resist an Apocalypse-grade powerhouse? Apart from her, there’s no one else in this world who can do it,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said slowly.</p>
<p>“Who is she?” Zhou Wen asked again, enunciating every word.</p>
<p>The silver-haired Companion Beast looked at Zhou Wen with a faint smile. “In human terms, her name should be Nüwa.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately alarmed. He never expected the silver-haired Companion Beast to give him such an answer.</p>
<p>Nüwa was a great existence in Eastern mythology</p>
<p>Pangu split the heavens and earth, and Nüwa created humans. It could be said that that was the origins of human mythology.</p>
<p>Could The Thearch be the legendary Mother of Humanity, Nüwa? Zhou Wen’s heart trembled, but on careful thought, it seemed possible.</p>
<p>The Battle of the Gods that destroyed the Shang dynasty and led to the rise of the Zhou dynasty was started by Nüwa. It seemed reasonable to say that Chess Mountain was related to Nüwa.</p>
<p>“Continue.” Zhou Wen stared at the silver-haired Companion Beast. He was eager to know more.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could sense that he was very close to the truth.</p>
<p>“Open it and you will know everything.” The silver-haired Companion Beast didn’t reveal any more information.</p>
<p>“Since you know that I can fight an Apocalypse-grade powerhouse, you must have seen my battle with Transcendent Immortal,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to threaten me. Even if you can kill an Apocalypse-grade existence, you can’t kill me.” The silver-haired Companion Beast could hear the threat in Zhou Wen’s words, but he didn’t seem to mind at all.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” Zhou Wen’s eyes turned cold. No matter how strong the silver-haired Companion Beast was, it couldn’t be stronger than the Apocalypse grade.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if he was really that powerful, how could he be trapped in such a place?</p>
<p>“Of course I’m sure. Unless Earth is destroyed, no one can kill me.” The silver-haired Companion Beast was indifferent, completely ignoring Zhou Wen’s threat.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen could tell what the silver-haired Companion Beast was implying but he found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>“Because I’m Earth’s Companion Beast.” The silver-haired Companion Beast’s words were like a bolt of lightning, leaving Zhou Wen stunned.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1793'>Chapter 1793 Deceived</h3>
<p>“You’re Earth’s Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen didn’t believe the silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Not to mention the birth of a planetary Companion Beast, even the birth of Calamity-grade powerhouses brought about huge disasters. The birth of a planetary Companion Beast would bring a huge disaster to the planet itself, and it might even lead to the planet’s destruction.</p>
<p>Just as the silver-haired Companion Beast had said, how could his birth have happened silently, to be easily dug out from an ancient well?</p>
<p>“I was, but currently not completely one,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said. “What do you mean?” Zhou Wen frowned. He really didn’t understand.</p>
<p>“In theory, I should be. Unfortunately, something went wrong. Earth produced another Companion Beast, so I’m not completely one.” The silver-haired Companion Beast sighed.</p>
<p>“I’ve never heard of such a thing.” Zhou Wen really couldn’t believe everything the silver-haired Companion Beast said.</p>
<p>“You won’t believe me no matter how I explain it. However, as long as you open it, you will naturally know the truth,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said.</p>
<p>After all that, he returned to the starting point. This gave Zhou Wen a headache.</p>
<p>He looked at the metal slab and frowned in silence.</p>
<p>The silver-haired Companion Beast didn’t rush him. He just looked at Zhou Wen as though he was certain that Zhou Wen would open the metal slab.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen decided to open it.</p>
<p>At this stage, if he didn’t open it now, he probably wouldn’t have another chance after he went to Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>The truth was right in front of him. If he stopped moving forward, how could he obtain the truth? Sometimes, risks needed to be taken without stepping back. “You’ve finally made a decision. That’s good.” The silver-haired Companion Beast saw through Zhou Wen’s thoughts and spoke with a smile.</p>
<p>“How do I open it?” Since he had already made up his mind, Zhou Wen didn’t waste his breath.</p>
<p>“You can treat it as a box encrypted by a passcode. As long as you know the passcode, you can open it…” the silver-haired Companion Beast said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if the passcode was the metal slab’s passcode, so he entered the passcode left behind by the former principal according to the method mentioned by the silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>After entering the password, the metal slab suddenly cracked.</p>
<p>The metal slab was originally one without any gaps, but now, it had cracked neatly. Then, it split into four pieces and slowly spread out, revealing the space inside.</p>
<p>When the metal slab was completely opened, Zhou Wen saw everything inside. His expression couldn’t help but turn nasty as he turned to look at the silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<p>The silver-haired Companion Beast seemed very surprised as well. His eyes were somewhat dazed, and his expression changed from surprise to disbelief before turning to anger.</p>
<p>“B*stard, that b*stard lied to me… He actually dared… He actually dared…” The silver-haired Companion Beast seemed extremely furious.</p>
<p>His silver hair fluttered despite the air being still as it stood up vertically. His body emitted a resplendent silver light.</p>
<p>With just a slight exertion of strength, he produced cracking sounds. The metal chains that restrained him snapped inch by inch.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen hadn’t isolated this space, such a huge commotion would have long attracted the people from Xiyuan Store.</p>
<p>“Nice acting,” Zhou Wen said coldly as he stared at the silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“Acting? I spent most of my life acting for you? F*ck acting!” the silver-haired Companion Beast cursed angrily.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Zhou Wen realized that he didn’t seem to be acting. He was indeed extremely angry. The grievance didn’t seem to be faked.</p>
<p>cem</p>
<p>“That b*stard said that he placed that thing inside. As long as I break free, the thing inside will automatically be destroyed. Only the passcode can open it…” The more the silver-haired Companion Beast spoke, the angrier he became. His eyes were filled with hatred as though he wanted to tear a living person apart and eat them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wore an odd expression. If it was really as the silver-haired Companion Beast had said, he was too miserable. In order not to destroy the thing inside the metal slab, he had been trapped here for decades. At the end of the day, there was nothing inside.</p>
<p>“Who is the person you’re talking about?” Zhou Wen was somewhat curious. What kind of talent could fool a fellow who claimed to be Earth’s Companion Beast to such an extent?</p>
<p>“Apart from that b*stard, Ouyang Ting, who else?” The silver-haired Companion Beast gritted his teeth as every word seemed to be squeezed out from his clenched teeth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had long guessed it, but he was still surprised when he heard the silver-haired Companion Beast say the name.</p>
<p>I never expected the former principal to have played such a trick, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>“Where’s that b*stard Ouyang Ting? I’m going to kill him!” The silver-haired Companion Beast’s eyes were bloodshot as he stared at Zhou Wen and asked.</p>
<p>“He should be at the Holy Temple,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“What kind of place is the Holy Temple?” the silver-haired Companion Beast asked with a frown. “Don’t you know about the Holy Temple? It’s the Holy Land that the dimension established on Earth.” Zhou Wen explained the origins of the Holy Temple.</p>
<p>“Impossible.” Upon hearing the establishment of the Holy Temple, the silver-haired Companion Beast suddenly interrupted Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What’s impossible?” Zhou Wen asked, perplexed.</p>
<p>“At that time, even the Immortals at their peak couldn’t develop such an area on Earth, much less the five dimensional races,” said the silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“How do you know it’s impossible?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“What kind of place do you think Earth is? Is it a place where those nobodies can behave atrociously? That’s…” The silver-haired Companion Beast suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>“That’s what?” Zhou Wen pressed.</p>
<p>“Anyway, it’s impossible for those idiots to have developed such a place on Earth at that time. It’s impossible even if they used all the dimensional powers.” The silver-haired Companion Beast clearly didn’t want to reveal those secrets.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found it funny when he heard that. For someone who had been fooled by an empty box for decades, he was one to call others idiots.</p>
<p>“I got it! Holy Temple… I see…” The silver-haired Companion Beast suddenly gritted his teeth and shouted.</p>
<p>Without waiting for Zhou Wen to ask him anything else, the silver-haired Companion Beast suddenly leaped up with a boom.</p>
<p>The entire building, along with the underground chamber, was penetrated. The silver-haired Companion Beast transformed into a silver stream of light that disappeared.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly chased after him. With his present speed, he could easily catch up to the silver-haired Companion Beast even without instant transmission.</p>
<p>What surprised Zhou Wen was that the silver-haired Companion Beast didn’t seem to have lied to him. The silver-haired Companion Beast’s strength was probably at the Terror grade. At most, it was at the peak of the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t stop the silver-haired Companion Beast because he could tell that he was heading in the direction of the Holy Land.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was surprised again when the silver-haired Companion Beast flew, his speed became faster and faster. Soon, he broke through.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could clearly sense that the silver-haired Companion Beast’s energy was increasing at an unbelievable speed.</p>
<p>What surprised him even more was that wherever the silver-haired Companion Beast flew, all sorts of plants rapidly grew. Even the withered flowers and trees instantly revived as though spring had instantly descended to the land.</p>
<p>Could it be that this fellow is really as he said, Earth’s Companion Beast? Zhou Wen seemed to begin believing what the silver-haired Companion Beast had said.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1794'>Chapter 1794 Destroying the Holy Land</h3>
<p>The silver-haired Companion Beast accelerated, and when he arrived at the Holy Land, the energy fluctuations he emitted were no longer inferior to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched as the silver-haired Companion Beast tore through space and entered the Holy Land. It didn’t use any equipment like a teleportation nexus.</p>
<p>If it were in the past, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have been able to accomplish this. It was only after advancing to the Calamity grade and fusing the eight abilities into one that he could do it as easily as the silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<p>The Holy Land hadn’t changed much from the past. The silver-haired Companion Beast ignored the various restrictions in the Holy Land as he swept his gaze while in midair before flying in one direction.</p>
<p>The majestic Sun God Temple was no different from what Zhou Wen had seen before. However, he didn’t see a single person along the way.</p>
<p>It was unknown where the Saints had gone. There was no one.</p>
<p>“Get out here.” The silver-haired Companion Beast looked at the Sun God Holy Temple and shouted coldly.</p>
<p>His voice wasn’t loud, it seemed to be able to penetrate the world and enter one’s mind. Zhou Wen felt his brain buzz from the sound.</p>
<p>However, the Sun God Holy Temple remained silent.</p>
<p>The silver-haired Companion Beast didn’t waste his breath. A silver glint flashed in his eyes, and without him moving, the almost indestructible Sun God Holy Temple rapidly decayed. Countless sprouts grew out of the palace.</p>
<p>As the sprouts rapidly grew, the Sun God Holy Temple also cracked and shattered. The palaces collapsed one after another, and the hard divine stones shattered.</p>
<p>In just a moment, the Sun God Holy Temple that had stood for years seemed to completely collapse, turning into fragments. The lush branches occupied the original spot of the Sun God Holy Temple.</p>
<p>At a glance, it looked like an ancient forest. It was completely unimaginable that it was once a holy palace.</p>
<p>At this stage, there was still no sign of anyone.</p>
<p>The silver-haired Companion Beast snorted coldly and headed in another direction.</p>
<p>Connate Holy Temple, Divine Emperor Holy Temple… Zhou Wen watched as the silver-haired Companion Beast destroyed the temples.</p>
<p>Those mysterious and strange Holy Temples were like tofu in front of the silver-haired Companion Beast. They were probably even inferior to tofu. They turned into fertilizer with a mere glance.</p>
<p>This fellow’s strength is really strange! Zhou Wen was secretly alarmed.</p>
<p>What surprised him even more was that the entire Holy Land was like a dead city. Five Holy Temples had been destroyed, but not a single living creature was seen.</p>
<p>Even if it’s not convenient for the five races of the dimension to interfere, where did those Saints go? What about Holy God? Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The last Trajectory Holy Temple turned into a vegetation paradise as well, but there were still no living creatures.</p>
<p>“Damn b*stard!” the silver-haired Companion Beast cursed angrily.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? They seem to know that you were coming.” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but ask. This was too bizarre.</p>
<p>“Ouyang Ting sure is scheming.” The silver-haired Companion Beast snorted coldly.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“Hmph, are you an idiot? You still don’t understand that everything was set up by Ouyang Ting. Holy Land? It’s just a nest of spies.” The silver-haired Companion Beast snorted coldly. “That old b*stard’s plan was good. Unfortunately, he underestimated my recovery ability. As long as he’s still on Earth, I can find him.”</p>
<p>“You mean that this Holy Land was created by Ouyang Ting?” Zhou Wen found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>“Who else could it be? You think you can obtain something like that with the power of the dimension? Dream on.” With a wave of the silver-haired Companion Beast’s hand, everything in the Holy Land revived. All sorts of plants grew crazily, and in a moment, the space in the Holy Land collapsed.</p>
<p>The sky seemed to crack like glass, revealing Earth’s normal scenery.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen realize that the so-called Holy Land was actually an island over the sea. It was completely different from what he had imagined.</p>
<p>The Holy Land was set up by the former principal. How is that possible? Zhou Wen’s heart churned in disbelief.</p>
<p>Back then, the former principal had been kidnapped by the Holy Land. In order to save him, Zhou Wen and the An family had spent a lot of effort.</p>
<p>But now that he thought about it, the silver-haired Companion Beast was trapped by the former principal. Apart from him, who could evacuate the Holy Land upon predicting that the silver-haired Companion Beast would escape?</p>
<p>The silver-haired Companion Beast ignored Zhou Wen’s thoughts. His eyes shimmered with silver light as though he had formed a strange connection with Earth. The silver light in his eyes seemed to resonate with the tides of the sea.</p>
<p>After a while, the silver-haired Companion Beast’s expression turned uglier.</p>
<p>“Strange, what’s going on? Could it be that that old b*stard is no longer in this world?” the silver-haired Companion Beast muttered to himself as his expression turned uglier.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pondered for a long time before asking the silver-haired Companion Beast, “Are you sure that the Holy Land was created by Ouyang Ting?” “Hmph, other than those who once obtained my strength, who else can help those fellows from the dimension produce such a space on Earth?” the silver-haired Companion Beast said proudly.</p>
<p>“Kid, what’s your relationship with that old b*stard?” the silver-haired Companion Beast suddenly stared at Zhou Wen and asked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss for an answer. In the past, Ouyang Ting was only his former principal who treated him well.</p>
<p>However, ever since Zhou Lingfeng told him the story that destroyed his worldview, Zhou Wen realized that Ouyang Ting was his grandfather.</p>
<p>“We’re considered relatives.” Zhou Wen had no intention of hiding it.</p>
<p>The silver-haired Companion Beast sized up Zhou Wen and said coldly, “Nonsense. The bloodline in you clearly belongs to that disappointing good-for-nothing. What has it got to do with that old fellow?”</p>
<p>“Who are you talking about?” he asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“Apart from that disappointing Zhou Lingfeng, who else could it be? Your eyes and brows are 70% similar to his. I get angry just seeing you.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Zhou Lingfeng is my father. How did he offend you?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“Offend me? He’s not qualified. Just mentioning him makes me angry. If he wasn’t so useless, I wouldn’t have been reduced to such a state.” The silver-haired Companion Beast became angrier as he spoke.</p>
<p>From the spiel of curses the silver-haired Companion Beast made, Zhou Wen roughly knew what had happened after Zhou Lingfeng obtained the silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<p>In the words of the silver-haired Companion Beast, Zhou Lingfeng was trash.</p>
<p>He clearly had the strongest Companion Beast on Earth, but he didn’t seek to improve himself. He spent all his time fooling around and hitting on girls. He didn’t cultivate at all, allowing the silver-haired Companion Beast to evolve very slowly. In the end, he forcefully separated the silver-haired Companion Beast from him and gave it to Ouyang Ting. To give such a huge opportunity to others made him nothing but a prodigal.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1795'>Chapter 1795 Cooperation</h3>
<p>Although the silver-haired Companion Beast made Zhou Lingfeng sound terrible, Zhou Wen didn’t think so.</p>
<p>Sometimes, giving up was harder than persisting. Furthermore, what the silver-haired Companion Beast said was only one-sided. Only they knew the truth.</p>
<p>“What’s your relationship with Chess Mountain?” Zhou Wen interrupted the silver-haired Companion Beast’s complaints and asked a question he really wanted the answer to.</p>
<p>If The Thearch was really Nüwa and the silver-haired Companion Beast was Earth’s Companion Beast, what was the relationship between the silver-haired Companion Beast that suddenly awakened when he approached Chess Mountain and Nüwa?</p>
<p>Could it be as Jing Daoxian had said, Chess Mountain was the beginning of myths?</p>
<p>“Why should I tell you?” The silver-haired Companion Beast snorted coldly.</p>
<p>“Don’t you owe me an answer?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>The silver-haired Companion Beast didn’t refute him this time. He had said that Zhou Wen only needed to open the metal slab to know the answer, but he hadn’t given him anything</p>
<p>“Speaking of which, we were all schemed against. The enemy of an enemy is a friend. Perhaps we can cooperate.” The silver-haired Companion Beast looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Your strength is barely passable. Perhaps you can help a little.”</p>
<p>“Cooperate? How?” Zhou Wen didn’t retort. If he wasn’t strong enough, how could the silver-haired Companion Beast cooperate with him? However, Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to fuss over this. He wanted to know as much as possible.</p>
<p>“Stop the birth of Earth’s Companion Beast.” The silver-haired Companion Beast’s answer surprised Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>answer</p>
<p>Zhou Wen imagined that he wanted to find Ouyang Ting, but the outcome was something else.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen got a rough idea of the situation on second thought.</p>
<p>Since the silver-haired Companion Beast was Earth’s former Companion Beast, and now that Earth had produced a new Companion Beast, it naturally hindered him. It wasn’t strange for the silver-haired Companion Beast to want to snatch back something that belonged to him.</p>
<p>Without waiting for Zhou Wen to ask, the silver-haired Companion Beast explained, “I want to snatch back what belongs to me. And if you don’t stop the birth of Earth’s Companion Beast, it will be the destruction of Earth when it is born. It will also be the end of humanity. Therefore, we have a common goal. Cooperation is the best choice.”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me the Earth Companion Beast you mentioned is on Chess Mountain?” Zhou Wen asked with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>“Apart from that, where else?” the silver-haired Companion Beast said.</p>
<p>“Have you forgotten that the Nüwa you mentioned left a wish mark on me? If I go to Chess Mountain, only death awaits me.” Zhou Wen wanted to obtain more useful information from the silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“Do you think she can’t kill you if you don’t go anywhere? How naive. She has already left a wish mark on you. As long as she’s willing, you won’t be able to escape death no matter where you go.” The silver-haired Companion Beast seemed to think of something as he sized up Zhou Wen and said, “It’s a little strange. She has already left a mark on you, but she didn’t attack you. That is strange.”</p>
<p>“Then tell me about her,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to say. Only one person can live, she or me. Without her, I wouldn’t have ended up in such a state,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said hatefully.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found it funny. This silver-haired Companion Beast tended to push everything on others.</p>
<p>One moment, he was talking about how he would have turned out without Ouyang Ting, while the next moment, he was talking about how he would turn out without Zhou Lingfeng. Now, he was talking about how he would turn out without Nüwa.</p>
<p>From Zhou Wen’s expression, the silver-haired Companion Beast knew what he was thinking. He immediately said angrily, “Kid, if you were me, I’m afraid you would be even worse than me.”</p>
<p>Enraged, the silver-haired Companion Beast recounted what had happened.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen truly sympathized with the silver-haired Companion Beast after hearing his story. It was a tragedy.</p>
<p>Every planet in the universe had only one Companion Egg. Zhou Wen had long known this, but where did these Companion Eggs come from? He never had an answer to this question.</p>
<p>According to the silver-haired Companion Beast, he didn’t know where he came from. When he gained consciousness, he was dug out by someone.</p>
<p>A planetary Companion Egg that had just been born and hadn’t begun the incubation process had been dug out. This was unimaginable.</p>
<p>However, someone had done it. That person was the Nüwa-also The Thearch as suspected by Zhou Wen-mentioned by the silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<p>As the silver-haired Companion Beast had just gained consciousness and was still ignorant, he didn’t know who the woman was.</p>
<p>Only after he awakened did he figure out what had happened.</p>
<p>Nüwa had used some unknown method to dig him out to nurture a new Earth Companion Beast.</p>
<p>As for why she was doing this, the silver-haired Companion Beast still didn’t know.</p>
<p>He only remembered that the woman had descended from the sky on a huge ship and dug him out while he was still an egg.</p>
<p>“A huge ship?” The scene of a huge ship immediately surfaced in Zhou Wen’s mind.</p>
<p>There were legends about a Great Flood in myths all over the world. And in the information Zhou Wen had obtained over the years, there was a story of a ship descending from the sky to save the humans in the flood.</p>
<p>The anchor and the woman’s portrait made the image in Zhou Wen’s mind even clearer.</p>
<p>Could it be that the flood back then was triggered by Nüwa’s ship entering the underground world to dig out the Earth Companion Egg? Zhou Wen gradually connected all the information together.</p>
<p>However, there was something Zhou Wen still didn’t understand. Why was it that in the legends of the Great Flood, there were legends of an ark saving humans in other areas, but there were no records of this in Eastern myths?</p>
<p>The Great Flood myth of the East only had the legend of Yu the Great controlling the water, but there was no record of a ship saving humans.</p>
<p>If Chess Mountain was the birthplace of Earth’s Companion Beast, wouldn’t the East have more legends about the ship?</p>
<p>“Let’s work together to kill her before she escapes. You get to live, and I’ll take back what belongs to me. We’ll each take what we need,” the silver-haired Companion Beast suggested again.</p>
<p>“Since you know that I have a wish mark, how do we go to Chess Mountain?”</p>
<p>“I naturally have a way. Otherwise, why would I want to work with you?” The silver-haired Companion Beast seemed confident as he turned around and left. “Follow me.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen flew with the silver-haired Companion Beast. At that moment, the energy fluctuations from the silver-haired Companion Beast had completely vanished. It was impossible to tell what level his strength had reached.</p>
<p>Just from his speed, he didn’t seem to be weaker than an Apocalypse-grade powerhouse like Transcendent Immortal.</p>
<p>Moments later, the silver-haired Companion Beast landed somewhere. Zhou Wen focused his gaze and was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>Why is it here? Zhou Wen was alarmed. The place the silver-haired Companion Beast had brought him to was Guide Ancient City.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1796'>Chapter 1796 Human Sovereign’s Stone Saber</h3>
<p>There were people coming and going around Guide Ancient City. Ever since Zhou Wen’s identity as Human Sovereign was exposed, more and more people rushed to Guide Ancient City.</p>
<p>Many ordinary people who were affiliated with other factions nearby had brought their families here, hoping to settle down here.</p>
<p>However, entering Guide Ancient City wasn’t as easy as before.</p>
<p>Many people had no choice but to stay outside, causing the periphery of Guide Ancient City to become abnormally lively. All sorts of tents and temporary camps could be seen everywhere. It even had a bazaar.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen appear, everyone watched from afar, but no one dared to speak.</p>
<p>“Interesting. It looks like they are rather respectful of you,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said mockingly.</p>
<p>“This city belongs to me now,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That’s really interesting,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said meaningfully as he walked into the ancient city.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed him in. After entering the ancient city, everyone he met would bow and call him City Lord. Some even called him “Your Excellency Human Sovereign.”</p>
<p>“Do you have what it takes to be called Human Sovereign?” The silver-haired Companion Beast couldn’t help but mock.</p>
<p>“It’s just a nickname. There are many nicknames like God, Saint, and Buddha. Human Sovereign is nothing,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>To his surprise, the silver-haired Companion Beast immediately scoffed when it heard Zhou Wen. “What God, Saint, Buddha? How can those things be compared to Human Sovereign?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen asked with interest.</p>
<p>The silver-haired Companion Beast seemed to have a very high evaluation of humans. He even believed that gods, immortals, saints, and buddhas couldn’t be compared to humans.</p>
<p>The silver-haired Companion Beast snorted coldly and continued walking forward without saying a word.</p>
<p>“Where are we going?” Zhou Wen wanted more information.</p>
<p>“You’ll know when we get there.” The silver-haired Companion Beast didn’t explain further.</p>
<p>Soon, the human and pet arrived in front of a strange building</p>
<p>“Fire God Platform?” Zhou Wen wore a strange expression. Fire God Platform could be said to be the core of Guide Ancient City. There was a stone saber embedded in the platform. Just shaking the stone saber an inch would cause a huge anomaly in Guide Ancient City.</p>
<p>Even The Thearch had designs on the stone saber. She wanted Zhou Wen to get it for her, but to no avail.</p>
<p>Now that the silver-haired Companion Beast was here, it was most likely for the stone saber.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen expected, after the silver-haired Companion Beast walked onto Fire God Platform, he came in front of the furnace with the stone saber and stared at it.</p>
<p>“If you want to touch it, it’s best you make yourself clear.” Zhou Wen stood in front of the silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<p>If the stone saber moved, there would definitely be a major change. The lives of hundreds of thousands of people in Guide Ancient City couldn’t be risked.</p>
<p>“It’s not me who wants to touch it, but you,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said with a twitch of its lips.</p>
<p>“Can it remove the wish mark on me?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“No.” The silver-haired Companion Beast’s answer surprised Zhou Wen, but he continued, “However, it can temporarily prevent Nüwa from triggering the wish mark on you.”</p>
<p>“Do you know what will happen if the stone saber is pulled out?” Zhou Wen probed.</p>
<p>“Nothing will happen,” the silver-haired Companion Beast answered without any hesitation.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, you aren’t sincere about cooperating with me.” Zhou Wen’s expression turned cold. “I once attempted to pull out the stone saber. Just a slight nudge caused a dimensional zone anomaly, but you’re telling me that nothing will happen?”</p>
<p>“It won’t since I’ve said so. Who do you think you are? Are you worth me lying to you?” The silver-haired Companion Beast said superciliously, “With me around, nothing will happen.”</p>
<p>“What’s the origin of this stone saber?” Zhou Wen asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>“To think you call yourself Human Sovereign. Don’t you even know about Human Sovereign’s stone saber?” the silver-haired Companion Beast teased.</p>
<p>“Human Sovereign’s stone saber?” Zhou Wen had never heard of it.</p>
<p>“The fire of human civilization was born from this saber,” the silver-haired Companion Beast explained casually.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the stone saber in the furnace in surprise. The evaluation of the silver-haired Companion Beast was extremely high.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen roughly knew that human civilization began with the use of tools and fire, but it was still somewhat controversial if stone tools were the earliest man-made tools.</p>
<p>“Cut the crap. With this saber protecting you, you can withstand Nüwa’s wish mark. Are you pulling it out or not?” the silver-haired Companion Beast said impatiently.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and didn’t say anything else. He walked to the stone furnace and reached out to grab the hilt of the stone saber.</p>
<p>In the past, he had to circulate the power of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra to move the stone saber, but now, there was no need to go through so much trouble.</p>
<p>With just a slight nudge, the stone saber moved a little.</p>
<p>To his surprise, the stone saber didn’t produce any anomalies despite the greater nudge.</p>
<p>“You sure are cautious. You have the same character as your useless father.” The silver-haired Companion Beast snorted coldly when he saw that Zhou Wen was only probing without really pulling out the stone saber.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought nothing of it as he slowly pulled out a sliver, but there was still no reaction.</p>
<p>“As expected of Earth’s Companion Beast!” Zhou Wen praised the silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<p>The silver-haired Companion Beast didn’t appreciate it and only grunted coldly.</p>
<p>He pulled out the stone saber bit by bit. Just as the silver-haired Companion Beast had said, Guide Ancient City showed no anomalies.</p>
<p>More than half of the stone saber had been pulled out. Just as Zhou Wen was about to completely pull it out, he suddenly heard a whistling sound. A figure tore through the air and arrived on Fire God Platform.</p>
<p>The figure had long gray hair and tattered armor. It was none other than the humanoid creature that had been guarding Guide Ancient City before Zhou Wen entered.</p>
<p>At that moment, the humanoid creature’s hair and beard were disheveled. Its eyes were red as it stared intently at Zhou Wen, who was pulling at the saber. However, it didn’t immediately pounce forward. Instead, it stood there motionless as it stared at Zhou Wen. It was unknown what he was thinking.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi’s voice sounded from below Fire God Platform. She quickly rushed up and ran to the humanoid creature’s side, trying her best to appease him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was able to enter Guide Ancient City thanks to Zhang Yuzhi’s control of the humanoid creature. However, from the looks of it, Zhang Yuzhi’s control of him had weakened drastically.</p>
<p>Under Zhang Yuzhi’s appeasement, the humanoid creature continued staring intently at Zhou Wen as though it would kill him at any moment.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had long thought of this uneasy factor, but he had no other choice.</p>
<p>The battle at Chess Mountain was probably ten thousand times more dangerous than the battle with Transcendent Immortal. He had to be prepared.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the battle with Transcendent Immortal, Zhou Wen had comprehended the trump card, “In the Human World.” He also had the confidence to defeat the humanoid creature.</p>
<p>The silver-haired Companion Beast watched coldly without saying a word.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the humanoid creature without retracting his strength as he pulled out the stone saber inch by inch.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1797'>Chapter 1797 As You Wish</h3>
<p>The stone saber was very rough. Instead of calling it a saber, it was more like a poorly polished stone rod.</p>
<p>The side near to the blade was rather smooth, but the side of the blade’s spine was abnormally rough. It was even pockmarked.</p>
<p>Only the handle of the saber was very smooth due to being excessively held. It felt like it had smoothened from oxidation.</p>
<p>At the instant the stone saber was pulled out, Zhang Yuzhi’s appeasement seemed to completely fail. The humanoid creature charged up and instantly tore through the air It arrived in front of Zhou Wen with a blast and reached out to grab the stone saber.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to attack the humanoid monster, he suddenly saw a silver flash. Vines grew out from under the humanoid creature’s feet like ropes, tying it up like a dumpling.</p>
<p>Just as the humanoid monster’s finger was about to touch the stone saber, it couldn’t advance any further despite extending it as much as it could.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the silver-haired Companion Beast who said indifferently, “I said that nothing will happen.”</p>
<p>The humanoid creature roared at Zhou Wen, but no matter how he struggled, he couldn’t escape the vines’ restraints.</p>
<p>“So the abilities of Earth’s Companion Beast are life-type?” Zhou Wen looked at the vines and muttered to himself.</p>
<p>“Bullsh*t. How can you fathom my abilities? This isn’t even strength, just something random,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said angrily as though he had suffered a great insult.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi sized up the silver-haired Companion Beast in surprise. She had spent the most time with humanoid creatures, so no one knew better than her how terrifying its strength was. The silver-haired Companion Beast could actually subdue it without moving a finger. This was already enough to surprise her.</p>
<p>However, none of this shocked her as much as Zhou Wen’s words. She never expected the one in front of her to be Earth’s Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“What are you looking at? That crappy ability of yours is useless against me. Stop wasting your emotions.” The silver-haired Companion Beast glanced coldly at Zhang Yuzhi.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, is he really Earth’s Companion Beast? You actually obtained Earth’s Companion Beast?” Zhang Yuzhi said in pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>“What kind of look is that? Is he even up to it…” Halfway through his sentence, the silver-haired Companion Beast seemed to find it inappropriate and said something else. “That punk is just my lackey.”</p>
<p>“Yuzhi, go back for now. I’ll tell you in detail later,” Zhou Wen said to Zhang Yuzhi.</p>
<p>“Can you not hurt him?” Zhang Yuzhi hesitated for a moment before looking at the humanoid creature.</p>
<p>“As long as it’s within my control, I won’t harm him.” Zhou Wen knew that Zhang Yuzhi’s ability was very special. She didn’t just control creatures. She had to also devote her feelings and treat the creatures as family.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally had no intention of killing the humanoid creature. This humanoid creature was very special, making him even more eager to figure out its origins.</p>
<p>“That’s great.” Zhang Yuzhi tried to convince the humanoid creature to leave with her, but at that moment, her ability was completely ineffective against it. The humanoid creature ignored her and struggled with all its might. It kept staring at the stone saber in Zhou Wen’s hand.</p>
<p>“He won’t die,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said coldly.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhang Yuzhi feel completely relieved. She tried to appease the silver-haired Companion Beast, but it was useless. Only then did she leave Fire God Platform under Zhou Wen’s persuasion.</p>
<p>“I’ve obtained the stone saber, but I don’t feel my connection with that person being severed,” Zhou Wen said to the silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“How can it be that easy? What do you think a wish mark is? It doesn’t belong to…” Before the silver-haired Companion Beast could finish its sentence, he stopped as though he realized that he had said too much.</p>
<p>“You want to cooperate with me, but you keep hiding everything from me. How can we cooperate?” Zhou Wen said with a sullen expression.</p>
<p>“It’s pointless telling you certain things. You might not believe me either. Instead, you might become overly cautious which won’t be good for either of us.” The silver-haired Companion Beast pointed at the humanoid creature and said, “This fellow is a little strange. If I’m not wrong, he was originally a human.”</p>
<p>“He’s human?” Zhou Wen knew that the silver-haired Companion Beast was changing the topic, but he was still shocked by his words. “There’s no mistake. He was definitely a human in the past. It’s not strange for a human to mutate, but it’s very strange for him to mutate so completely. Unless…” The silver-haired Companion Beast sized up the humanoid monster and pondered.</p>
<p>“Unless what?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Unless he’d willingly given up his bottom line as a human and had been to that place.” The silver-haired Companion Beast wore a strange expression.</p>
<p>“If you continue talking to me in riddles, our cooperation will end here,” Zhou Wen said with a sullen expression.</p>
<p>“Unless he entered that ship. That’s the only place that can completely transform humans into creatures.” The silver-haired Companion Beast paused and curled his lips. “I also want to explain it to you, but I don’t completely understand it myself. How can I explain it clearly? If you want to know the truth, ask Nüwa yourself.” “Cut the crap. How do I use this stone saber?” Zhou Wen could sense a strange power contained in the stone saber, but this power couldn’t sever the connection between the mark and The Thearch.</p>
<p>“Give me the saber,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said as he extended his hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at the silver-haired Companion Beast before throwing the stone saber at him.</p>
<p>“You are a little braver than your father. You aren’t considered pure trash.” The silver-haired Companion Beast sized up the stone saber and spoke without looking up. It was unknown if it was a compliment or mockery.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could say anything, the silver-haired Companion Beast suddenly held the stone saber in reverse and stabbed it into its chest.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was dumbfounded. The stone saber penetrated the silver-haired Companion Beast’s chest, with the blade seemingly protruding from his back.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Zhou Wen stared at the silver-haired Companion Beast and asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“Indeed, this Human Sovereign Stone Saber isn’t enough. Cut the crap. Success or failure depends on this. I’ll trust you humans one more time,” the silver-haired Companion Beast looked at his chest and whispered.</p>
<p>At the spot where the stone saber touched his chest, silver flames arose as though they were leaking out of his body and burning his flesh.</p>
<p>“Come, pull out the saber.” The silver-haired Companion Beast released the hilt and spread out his hands. He looked up at Zhou Wen as silver light bloomed in his eyes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen finally understood what he was doing. Companion Beasts couldn’t automatically terminate their contracts with humans, so the contract on the silver-haired Companion Beast probably hadn’t been completely terminated. Now, he wanted to use the stone saber to sever his contract with humans, but this was clearly not enough. Therefore, he could only choose to use this opportunity to have a new contract replace the previous one.</p>
<p>In other words, if he succeeded, the silver-haired Companion Beast would become Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“As you wish.” Zhou Wen reached out and grabbed the hilt of the stone saber again, pulling it out with all his might.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1798'>Chapter 1798 Annihilation</h3>
<p>As the stone saber was pulled out, the silver-haired Companion Beast’s body floated in the air. His limbs leaned back as his chest protruded out like he were a living sacrifice.</p>
<p>Silver flames spewed out and surged towards Zhou Wen’s body, instantly enveloping him.</p>
<p>Companion Beasts that had already signed a contract couldn’t sign a contract with others, but with the stone saber as a medium, a new contract formed between the two.</p>
<p>A silver symbol gradually appeared on Zhou Wen’s chest.</p>
<p>The silver-haired Companion Beast’s body gradually dissipated in the silver flames until he completely vanished. The silver symbol on Zhou Wen’s chest was resplendent.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen looked down to see what the symbol on his chest was, he saw it suddenly flash and vanish without Zhou Wen’s control.</p>
<p>In the next second, Zhou Wen’s entire body suddenly emitted silver light. His black hair quickly turned silver, and even his eyes were filled with silver.</p>
<p>“Who the hell stipulated that Companion Beasts can only be used as slaves to human? What are humans? I’m the true ruler of everything!” The silver-haired Companion Beast’s will roared crazily in Zhou Wen’s mind.</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen’s consciousness hadn’t been completely occupied, but he wasn’t flustered. All he did was calmly communicate with the silver-haired Companion Beast’s will.</p>
<p>“Why? Don’t you understand? What a stupid fellow. By occupying your body, I can be my absolute self. No one can control me anymore.” The silver-haired Companion Beast mocked, “I still have to thank you for the body you contributed to me. I’m very satisfied with this body. A Calamity-grade capable of producing Apocalypse-grade strength. As expected of a race that has been blessed.”</p>
<p>“That’s why you chose me and not anyone else,” Zhou Wen said calmly.</p>
<p>“Hmph, I’ve already been scammed twice. I don’t have the patience to play any games. This time, I’m going to do it in one step. You don’t have to resent Lingfeng for screwing me over so badly. A son has to repay his father’s debt. That’s your life.” The silver-haired Companion Beast seemed to be in an extremely good mood. It spoke frankly unlike before.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that he was trash? How did he scam you again?” Zhou Wen continued asking.</p>
<p>Sensing that Zhou Wen’s willpower was weakening, the silver-haired Companion Beast said smugly, “That trash isn’t good at anything, but he’s very cunning. He kept delaying his cultivation, preventing me from evolving. He even f*cking tricked me and forcefully stripped me of my Essence Energy… However, it doesn’t matter now. I’ll take back everything he owes me.”</p>
<p>“In that case, everything you said about Nüwa was a lie?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“Do I need to lie to a nobody like you? That woman indeed tore through the air on a boat and forcefully dug me out of the core. Unfortunately, she died after that.” The silver-haired Companion Beast snorted coldly.</p>
<p>“Died?” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be taken aback. Since she’s dead, who’s the one at Chess Mountain?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen never expected such an outcome. “Who else could it be other than Nüwa?” The silver-haired Companion Beast’s explanation confused Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“You mean that the woman who steered the boat isn’t the same person as Nüwa? The one in Chess Mountain is Nüwa, and the one driving the boat is another woman? Who’s Nüwa? Who’s the woman?” Zhou Wen quickly understood what the silver-haired Companion Beast meant.</p>
<p>“I also want to know who that woman is. She came on a ship and descended into this world. She shattered the dimension single-handedly and forcefully dug out the planet’s egg. That’s an unparalleled shocking ability…” When the silver-haired Companion Beast spoke of the woman, there was a hint of admiration.</p>
<p>“Shattered the dimension? Isn’t she an Immortal? How can she shatter the dimension?” Zhou Wen could tell that something was amiss.</p>
<p>According to the information he had obtained, the woman who had descended on the ship was likely the supreme existence of the Immortals.</p>
<p>However, from the silver-haired Companion Beast’s tone, it didn’t seem to be the case.</p>
<p>“The Immortals are nothing. They aren’t worthy of being lumped with her,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said disdainfully. “Because of her descent, the entire dimension was almost shattered. A mere Immortal is nothing.”</p>
<p>“Now, your body will be used by me. In the future, you will definitely become the ruler of the entire world. That will also be your glory.” The silver-haired Companion Beast devoured crazily, hoping to completely devour Zhou Wen’s consciousness.</p>
<p>“I’m looking forward to seeing that day, but unfortunately, you can’t,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Whether it works or not isn’t up to you… to say…” Before the silver-haired Companion Beast could finish its sentence, it suddenly realized that Zhou Wen’s seemingly weak consciousness had suddenly turned from weak to strong. No matter how he devoured it, he couldn’t completely erase Zhou Wen’s consciousness.</p>
<p>“Heavens, it’s no wonder you can resist an Apocalypse with your Calamity body. The strength of your will is almost inhuman. So you were also plotting against me. Unfortunately, you’re still too inexperienced. I’m Earth’s Companion Beast. On Earth, no life can compete with my will…” The silver-haired Companion Beast’s will became stronger and stronger, as though the entire Earth’s will was injecting energy into him.</p>
<p>Even someone as tenacious as Zhou Wen felt an unparalleled pressure. His consciousness was being devoured bit by bit.</p>
<p>“This body is mine!” The silver-haired Companion Beast’s consciousness roared crazily.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, the silver-haired Companion Beast’s crazy roar stopped.</p>
<p>Another will suddenly appeared in his consciousness.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen finally activated Sigh of the King as the strange woman’s consciousness awakened.</p>
<p>“How… How is this possible…” The silver-haired Companion Beast’s consciousness seemed to tremble violently as though something extremely terrifying had happened.</p>
<p>“Impossible… Impossible… Aren’t you already dead… How is it possible…” The silver-haired Companion Beast felt the strange consciousness. Its horror had already exceeded the limits of his mental endurance.</p>
<p>“Annihilate.” Like a woman ruling the world, she didn’t even look at the silver-haired Companion Beast as she indifferently spat out a word.</p>
<p>The silver color over Zhou Wen’s body instantly receded like a tidal wave. The silver-haired Companion Beast’s consciousness also vanished amidst extreme horror.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s eyes regained clarity as he looked down at his chest. He saw all the silver condensed on his chest, forming a silver symbol.</p>
<p>Could it be that the Sigh of the King transformed from the Lost Immortal Sutra is the woman mentioned by the silver-haired Companion Beast? Unfortunately, I couldn’t get more useful information from him. Zhou Wen felt mixed emotions.</p>
<p>He never expected that the final answer was already on him.</p>
<p>He habitually took out his phone and looked at his stats. Indeed, there was a new Companion Beast in the Companion Beast column.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1799'>Chapter 1799 All Lives Are Equal</h3>
<p>Prisoner: Apocalypse grade (Incomplete Body) Life Providence: All Life Life Soul: All Life Wheel of Destiny: All Life (S-grade)</p>
<p>Terror Form: All Life</p>
<p>Calamity Zone: All Life (Heaven level)</p>
<p>New World: All Life</p>
<p>Strength: 1,013</p>
<p>Speed: 1,014</p>
<p>Constitution: 1,052</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 1,000</p>
<p>Talent Skill: None</p>
<p>Companion Form: Soul</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was stunned when he saw the silver-haired Companion Beast’s stats.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because he was ridiculously strong, but because he was too weak. A dignified Apocalypse-grade Companion Beast only had such stats.</p>
<p>Just the Calamity-grade Mystic Thearch and Truth Listener’s stats were about the same as his. Apart from having the New World that the Apocalypse grade should have, he didn’t have anything that stood out.</p>
<p>What was even more surprising was that his Life Providence, Life Soul, Wheel of Destiny, Terror transformation, Calamity Zone, and New World were all the same.</p>
<p>He’s an Apocalypse-grade Companion Beast at the end of the day. Why is he so weak? Zhou Wen summoned Prisoner.</p>
<p>Silver light flashed as the silver-haired Companion Beast appeared in front of him again. His hair was still messy and his clothes were disheveled. However, the silver-haired Companion Beast’s eyes had already lost their luster. He was like a puppet that only knew how to follow Zhou Wen’s orders.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the silver-haired Companion Beast no longer had a sense of self. Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed. He originally hoped to obtain some useful information from him, but from the looks of it, it was impossible.</p>
<p>Thankfully, his companion form is a soul. I can be imbued with his powers. Zhou Wen ordered Prisoner to transform into a soul and attach himself to him.</p>
<p>The silver light fused into Zhou Wen’s body as his hair and pupils turned silver. His hair strangely grew longer, almost reaching his feet. His armor also seemed to be plated with a layer of silver.</p>
<p>What’s the use of this All Life New World? I hope it doesn’t disappoint me. Zhou Wen felt the power Prisoner gave him.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen’s eight techniques fused into one, his comprehension of strength far exceeded the ordinary Calamity grade. He wasn’t inferior to the Apocalypse grade and even exceeded it in certain things.</p>
<p>After carefully comprehending it for a moment, Zhou Wen revealed a look of delight.</p>
<p>The power of All Life exceeded Zhou Wen’s expectations. Although Prisoner’s abilities were all one and the same, they were very useful.</p>
<p>If he wanted to use a word to describe the abilities of All Life, Zhou Wen felt that he only needed to add the word “equality” behind it.</p>
<p>Within the power range of the All Life New World, be it immortals, saints, buddhas, or demons, they were all equal. They all had the right to die.</p>
<p>Yes, right. It wasn’t to kill the enemy, but to let him obtain the right to die.</p>
<p>This power didn’t have any substantial lethality. It didn’t sound impressive, but on careful thought, one could tell that it was a very crazy ability.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen fought Transcendent Immortal, she had displayed extraordinary self-healing abilities. The damage Zhou Wen had dealt to her wasn’t as fast as her self-healing speed.</p>
<p>However, after possessing All Life, she couldn’t heal from the injuries Zhou Wen inflicted. Even powerhouses with the ability to revive wouldn’t be revived.</p>
<p>Together with Zhou Wen’s own Human Realm domain, it could be said to be a perfect match.</p>
<p>Although my physique is a little lacking, this ability is impressive. Now, Zhou Wen completely believed Prisoner’s previous words.</p>
<p>It was likely that he had been dug out ahead of time. Otherwise, his stats wouldn’t be so bad, nor would he be crippled.</p>
<p>What a pity. I wonder how strong a complete Earth Companion Beast will be. Zhou Wen felt regretful.</p>
<p>What delighted Zhou Wen even more was that the power of New World’s All Life could affect the wish mark The Thearch had left on him.</p>
<p>However, it only had an effect; it didn’t not fully remove it!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if this influence could completely isolate the connection between The Thearch and him, but it was better than having no defense at all.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I have to make a trip to Chess Mountain to completely eliminate the wish mark, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>The safest way was to advance to the Apocalypse grade before heading to Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen hadn’t come up with anything other than killing Apocalypse-grade creatures and obtaining their powers to rise up the ranks.</p>
<p>But how many Apocalypse-grade creatures were there on Earth? Which one could Zhou Wen kill?</p>
<p>The places on Earth that Zhou Wen suspected to have Apocalypse-grade creatures were Mount Laojun, Small Buddha Temple, and a few others. The most likely place was Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>There was also an Apocalypse grade that Zhou Wen was basically certain of-Sweetie.</p>
<p>Of course, it was impossible for Zhou Wen to kill Sweetie. Even if he wanted to kill her, he couldn’t find her. It was even more likely that he wasn’t Sweetie’s match.</p>
<p>He glanced at the trapped humanoid creature and put away the stone saber. He lifted him up and locked him in a palace.</p>
<p>He was very likely a human who had boarded that huge ship. Perhaps he could gain some clues from him in the future.</p>
<p>However, before that, Zhou Wen had to find someone who was good at stealing soul information. As his thoughts were in a mess, he definitely wouldn’t be able to get anything out of him.</p>
<p>He got Zhang Yuzhi to try to appease the humanoid creature. After a few attempts, he realized that as long as the stone saber didn’t appear near him, Zhang Yuzhi’s ability was still very effective against him.</p>
<p>What has this stone saber got to do with him? Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss.</p>
<p>The origins of the stone saber were very problematic. Logically speaking, the Human Sovereign Stone Saber was likely related to Suirenshi.</p>
<p>However, the stone saber was on Fire God Platform. Fire God Platform was called Fire God Platform, but it was actually an observatory. It had nothing to do with Suirenshi.</p>
<p>What’s the use of this saber? Zhou Wen held the stone saber and studied it.</p>
<p>There was indeed a masculine Yang force in the saber. It was as red as fire, but the power it truly stimulated wasn’t fire-elemental.</p>
<p>Ordinary powers couldn’t be released from the stone saber. No matter how much Essence Energy Zhou Wen injected, the stone saber couldn’t release an inch of saber aura.</p>
<p>A stone saber that could only be used in melee combat could only be tested in actual combat.</p>
<p>In the dimension.</p>
<p>On a mountain that burned like the sun, the temperature was probably capable of instantly melting steel.</p>
<p>However, on such a mountain, there was an extremely majestic palace made of gold.</p>
<p>This was where the Solarians lived. It was one of the strongest races in the dimension and had several Apocalypse-grade experts.</p>
<p>In the past, if another race came to Inocciduus Divine Mountain, even an Apocalypse-grade expert wouldn’t step past it. They would land at the foot of the mountain and walk up to the Sun God Temple.</p>
<p>However, today, a white figure floated above Inocciduus Divine Mountain and sized up the Sun God Temple beneath his feet.</p>
<p>“Wang Mingyuan, do you have a death wish?” Several ancient voices sounded from the Sun God Temple. The flames that enveloped the entire Inocciduus Divine Mountain raged crazily with the voices as though they wanted to burn the entire world to ashes.</p>
<p>“Death or submission is a choice you need to make,” Wang Mingyuan said indifferently.</p>
