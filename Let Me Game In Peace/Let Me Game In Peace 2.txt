<h3 id='chapter100'>Chapter 100 Wordless Monument</h3>
<p>Mount Laojun wasn’t in Sunset College. Zhou Wen originally didn’t wish to go that far, but he had to complete the school’s homework missions. Otherwise, he couldn’t graduate so it was practically compulsory.</p>
<p>As for Li Xuan, he was very excited as he sat on the bus and continually explained Mount Laojun to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“A place like Mount Laojun can be said to be the safest dimensional zone. Although there are many dimensional creatures, they won’t attack humans without reason. As long as you don’t annoy them, there’s no danger at Mount Laojun. The only thing to take note of is that our homework mission is to visit the Wordless Monument. It’s also known as Unwinding Monument. No matter how strong a person’s will is, they can’t look at it for more than half an hour or things will turn fun…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sat by the window, grinding the Ant Nest dungeon while listening to Li Xuan’s detailed explanation of Mount Laojun.</p>
<p>“What’s so fun?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“That thing is very sinister. Although it doesn’t kill people, it will make people excited and make them constantly wish to do something,” said Li Xuan with a chuckle.</p>
<p>Mount Laojun was in Luoyang, so it wasn’t long before the bus arrived.</p>
<p>It was different from what Zhou Wen had imagined. Mount Laojun wasn’t too tall, but it had many peaks with pine and cypress trees winding around them. There were ancient buildings erected above the mountain, making it a picturesque scene.</p>
<p>From afar, Mount Laojun looked like a classic ink painting of landscapes.</p>
<p>Wang Fei did a headcount before taking the students up the mountain.</p>
<p>There were rabbits, squirrels, and other small critters on the mountain, as well as groups of immortal cranes flying in the clouds. They showed no fear of humans and only curiously observed the students from Sunset College.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept searching for the palm symbol, but he hadn’t discovered one. However, he wasn’t worried as the mysterious phone could automatically lock onto the tiny palm symbol if it was close enough.</p>
<p>The most mysterious thing about Mount Laojun was the Golden Peak. There were many mysterious ancient buildings there, but no human could ascend to the Golden Peak.</p>
<p>Legend had it that people once saw countless animals crawling out of the mountain, such as snakes, worms, rats and insects. The black mass of creatures covered the entire Mount Laojun as they prostrated for three full days in front of the Golden Peak before dispersing.</p>
<p>It was almost taboo to spill blood on the land around Mount Laojun. There was once someone who attempted to carry out a massacre and kill those gentle dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Just as that person had killed a dimensional creature that resembled a white rabbit, his expression changed drastically for some reason. He turned around and ran down the mountain like a madman.</p>
<p>When his friend went to look for him the next day, he wouldn’t have been able to recognize him if not for his clothes and personal items.</p>
<p>That person was covered in rabbit fur, and his mouth had turned into three lines like a rabbit. His eyes were red and he was sprawled on the ground eating grass like a rabbit. He couldn’t be stopped from doing so no matter how hard his friend tried. He became a lunatic for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Since then, no one dared to kill on Mount Laojun. Even the spilling of blood was taboo.</p>
<p>Legend had it that an Epic expert didn’t believe in the rumors and started a killing spree on Mount Laojun, but the outcome was equally tragic.</p>
<p>This was all the knowledge taught in school, and Zhou Wen didn’t know how true it was. However, as he walked up Mount Laojun, he indeed felt very serene. There seemed to be a magical power here that calmed one’s mind.</p>
<p>Wang Fei led the students to a platform on the mountainside and pointed to a stone monument at the end of the platform, saying, “That’s the legendary Unwinding Monument. Although it doesn’t have a word on it, it has magical powers. Your homework mission is to sit in front of the Unwinding Monument for half an hour and stare at it. Not one second less and not one second more.”</p>
<p>The stone monument was only two to three meters tall. It looked old and dilapidated, and there was nothing out of the ordinary about it. It stood by the edge of the mountainside, looking like it accompanied the rosy clouds of dawn. Its solitude had an indescribable feeling to it as though just staring at it would placate any irascible feelings.</p>
<p>“Line up, ten people in a row. Sit down in front of Unwinding Monument. Wear the sunglasses I gave you. Listen to my instructions before taking them off. Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, don’t just stand at the back. Come to the first row.” Wang Fei arranged for a group of students to sit in front of Unwinding Monument, and, when she saw Zhou Wen and Li Xuan at the back, she immediately called them to the front.</p>
<p>The closer one was to the Unwinding Monument, the stronger the effects. Wang Fei had steeled her heart to help Zhou Wen regain his drive.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t mind where he sat. Anyway, there wasn’t any risk looking at the Unwinding Monument as long as one didn’t exceed the time limit.</p>
<p>The only things that left Zhou Wen a little disappointed were his failure to find the tiny palm symbol, and that the mysterious phone hadn’t vibrated.</p>
<p>Could it be that Mount Laojun’s dimensional zone is at the Golden Peak? Zhou Wen looked at the mountaintop as he secretly made plans.</p>
<p>Seeing how Zhou Wen was still looking around, Wang Fei thought to herself, After you look at the Wordless Monument, you won’t be as half-hearted as you are now.</p>
<p>“Alright, take note. Take off your sunglasses. Everyone is to begin looking at the Wordless Monument. The time limit is half an hour. If you get up before half an hour, it will be a failure and you will have to look at it for another half an hour.” Wang Fei wore the sunglasses without any intention of taking them off. All she did was start the stopwatch in her hand.</p>
<p>These sunglasses were specially made. Wearing them to look at the Wordless Monument decreased its effects significantly. However, one still couldn’t keep looking at it because with prolonged staring at it, even the sunglasses were useless.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and the rest of the students took off their sunglasses as their gazes landed on the Wordless Monument.</p>
<p>It was strange. Initially, many students felt nervous. However, after looking at the Wordless Monument, their nervous feelings vanished instantly. They relaxed entirely and their spirits became extremely tranquil.</p>
<p>However, this feeling of tranquility became a little odd as time passed.</p>
<p>Although one’s mind remained calm, energy seemed to surge in their bodies. It made the students feel like they were filled with Primordial Energy. They yearned to immediately get up and begin carrying out a series of boxing moves or fight someone. This irascible feeling that came from within stood in strong contrast with the tranquility their minds generated.</p>
<p>The students naturally didn’t dare to stand up. They had only sat down for less than three minutes, so standing up now would mean the failure of their homework mission. All they could do was sit there and bear with it.</p>
<p>This feeling was like a person who was hyperactive but had to sit there and not move an inch. It was not something a person could usually understand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also felt the same stirring feelings, but he only felt them a little bit at the beginning. Just as his body began to stir, the Lost Immortal Sutra that was circulating at a normal speed gradually slowed down. It made Zhou Wen’s body feel strange as the irascible feelings slowly vanished.</p>
<p>Why is this happening? Zhou Wen was alarmed. The last time the Lost Immortal Sutra did such a thing was when he was reading the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra.</p>
<h3 id='chapter101'>Chapter 101 New Primordial Energy Art</h3>
<p>Just like the last time, the Lost Immortal Sutra’s circulation increasingly slowed down. After some time, it was as if it was about to stop.</p>
<p>At the instant the Lost Immortal Sutra came to a complete halt, Zhou Wen felt his body suddenly come to a halt, as though there was a crisp sound of a lock being turned.</p>
<p>The last time, Zhou Wen had been rather slow to react and didn’t have too strong a feeling. Now, after carefully sensing it, he realized that the ceasing of the aura circulation wasn’t the only thing. His entire body had come to a halt and even his heart had skipped a beat.</p>
<p>This pause only lasted for an instant. In the next second, Zhou Wen felt his Primordial Energy rapidly circulate. However, this circulation pathway was completely different from the Lost Immortal Sutra’s Energy. It also wasn’t that of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, but a different Primordial Energy Art that he had never cultivated before.</p>
<p>This Primordial Energy Art had a strange feeling of having his body fuse with the world itself. It was as though his entire being had become a part of the universe. His heart and the breathing of the universe was happening at the same frequency.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen did not see a single word on the Wordless Monument, but he could sense the Primordial Energy Art came from it. It was a very strange feeling that was indescribable.</p>
<p>Wang Fei constantly observed her students to prevent any accidents happening from staring at the Wordless Monument.</p>
<p>However, Wang Fei’s attention was mostly focused on Zhou Wen. She wanted to see him change. She wanted to see him turn from a loser obsessed with gaming to a diligent genius.</p>
<p>But soon, Wang Fei felt something amiss.</p>
<p>The other students were all sweating profusely, trying their best to hold back their irascible emotions as they wore heavy or ferocious expressions. Even the extremely resolute students were frowning and looking as though they were struggling to cope.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was completely different. He naturally looked relaxed as he sat there languidly, as though he was sunbathing. It was as if he didn’t feel any pressure.</p>
<p>Could it be that Zhou Wen is so disheartened that even the Unwinding Monument’s power can’t help him? Wang Fei naturally didn’t believe this. She only believed that Zhou Wen hadn’t been exposed for long enough.</p>
<p>As time passed, the expressions of the other students worsened. The students who had weaker self-restraint started to move around as if their bodies were crawling with worms.</p>
<p>However, none of them stood up. They were the top students from every high school, so they naturally had their pride. None of them wanted to lose to their classmates, so they had to endure it.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s condition was slightly better. One could tell that his will was extremely firm. He sat there motionless without any changes in expression. However, the sweat on his forehead indicated that he was not having an easy time.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Wen, he was still languidly sitting beside Li Xuan. His expression hadn’t changed from the beginning to the end. Furthermore, he appeared more and more relaxed. If not for Wang Fei’s requirements for them to sit, he would likely be lying on the ground.</p>
<p>Strange, how did this happen? Wang Fei was alarmed.</p>
<p>She had also stared at the Wordless Monument before, so she naturally knew how powerful it was. Zhou Wen was only at the Mortal stage, even Epic experts would be influenced by the power of the Wordless Monument. It was absolutely impossible to be this relaxed.</p>
<p>It has already been ten minutes, but he hasn’t reacted at all. Could it be… Wang Fei’s heart skipped a beat when she thought of a possibility.</p>
<p>Someone had previously guessed that there was a mysterious Primordial Energy Art engraved on the Wordless Monument, but was invisible to everyone.</p>
<p>If a candidate with a suitable physique placed their eyes on the Wordless Monument, perhaps it would reveal the Primordial Energy Art on it.</p>
<p>Could it be that Zhou Wen has a special physique that has an affinity with the art on the Wordless Monument? Wang Fei believed that the chances of that happening were extremely low, but Zhou Wen’s present performance was somewhat odd.</p>
<p>She planned on observing further. If Zhou Wen truly had a special physique that had an affinity with the Wordless Monument, she would have to reevaluate Zhou Wen’s future achievements.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, Sis Lan has really picked up a treasure. She got a free son from her marriage, one who has a one-in-a-billion special physique. That would be incredible. Wang Fei looked at Zhou Wen with mixed emotions as countless thoughts ran through her mind.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was feeling extremely relaxed. After completing one circulation, it was already enough for him to use it, just like the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra.</p>
<p>At the same time, he felt that his body was filled with Primordial Energy. It was as though every breath he took could draw Primordial Energy from the world into his body.</p>
<p>Although he couldn’t make attempts, Zhou Wen felt that his Primordial Energy recovery was much faster than before.</p>
<p>Now, he wished to switch on the game to see how his stats had changed. But in the present situation, it was inconvenient for him to take out his phone to game. All he could do was hold back his desire and continue staring at the Wordless Monument.</p>
<p>After waiting for quite a while and seeing Zhou Wen maintain his languid expression with no special changes to the monument, Wang Fei began thinking about her previous idea.</p>
<p>Could it be that Zhou Wen doesn’t have a special physique, but that he’s born with that expression? Wang Fei was puzzled as she looked at Zhou Wen’s languid look.</p>
<p>Half an hour quickly passed, but that was only for Zhou Wen. To the other students, half an hour felt like a century.</p>
<p>When Wang Fei announced that the mission was over, all the classmates leaped up at the same time. Some were running at full speed, while others were exerting all their strength to strike out a set of moves. Some were constantly somersaulting.</p>
<p>There were also some students who were quieter. Although they did not engage in any intense activity, they also circulated the Primordial Energy Art they had cultivated and quickly circulated it again and again.</p>
<p>As for some irascible fellows, they even used their Primordial Energy Skills to deliver a barrage of fists on the mountain rocks. It was as if that was the only way they could vent their infinite energy.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was an especially energetic fellow, but he didn’t strike the rocks. Instead, he was sprawled on the ground doing push-ups as though he had an electric motor installed in him.</p>
<p>Wang Fei was very satisfied with her students’ performance. Although the power of the Wordless Monument was strange, as long as she used it well, it would be a great boon in educating them.</p>
<p>However, when her gaze landed on Zhou Wen, her good mood immediately vanished.</p>
<p>She saw Zhou Wen sitting on a rock beside the stone wall as he quickly took out his phone. He held the phone in his hands and was tapping away his fingers at a dazzling speed. Without looking at his phone screen, it was obvious that the fellow was playing a game.</p>
<h3 id='chapter102'>Chapter 102 Three-Eyed Antelope</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen secretly dripped a drop of blood on the phone screen. Although the blood-colored avatar was still alive, he still did the same</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>This was because this blood could represent his present physical condition. The blood-colored avatar condensed from the previous blood drop had stats of his previous self.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen</p>
<p>Age: 16 years</p>
<p>Lifeform level: Mortal</p>
<p>Strength: 10</p>
<p>Speed: 10</p>
<p>Constitution: 11</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 11</p>
<p>Primordial Energy Art: Lost Immortal Sutra</p>
<p>Primordial Energy Skill: Vigor Divine Fist, Ashen Palm, Blood Meditation, Penetrating Pierce, Dragon Gate Fairy Skill</p>
<p>Companion Beast: Truth Listener, Silver-Winged Flying Ant, Mutated Lotus Flower Ant</p>
<p>My Primordial Energy has risen to 11. My Primordial Energy Art is still Lost Immortal Sutra without any new Primordial Energy Art appearing. Zhou Wen looked at his stats as countless thoughts ran through his mind.</p>
<p>The game displayed Lost Immortal Sutra as his only Primordial Energy Art. It meant that he had not mastered any others, but he could freely switch modes to the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra or the Wordless Monument’s Primordial Energy Art. It was truly fascinating.</p>
<p>Seeing the other students desperately venting their energies without paying attention to him, Zhou Wen put away his phone and planned on walking around Mount Laojun to see if he could find the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>Since he had mastered the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra the last time, he had obtained Truth Listener that was suspected to be a Mythical creature. Perhaps, the Wordless Monument’s Primordial Energy Art had similar benefits too.</p>
<p>Legend had it that no one could ascend Mount Laojun’s Golden Peak, so perhaps there was an existence akin to the three-faced Buddha inside.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen wasn’t planning on walking straight to Golden Peak himself to verify his theory. All he wanted was to find the tiny palm symbol to download Mount Laojun’s dungeon and try it out in-game.</p>
<p>He had only taken a few steps when Wang Fei appeared in front of him. She stared at him and asked, “Where are you going?”</p>
<p>No matter how she looked at it, Zhou Wen didn’t look like he needed to vent his energy. He was still as languid as usual, but he looked much better than before.</p>
<p>“I have an inexhaustible amount of energy all over my body. I need to run to release it.” Zhou Wen’s insincere words were so obvious, that they nearly made Wang Fei laugh out in exasperation.</p>
<p>“You want to run? Very good. Run twenty times from the foot of the mountain to the stone bridge in front of Golden Peak. I’ll be here watching you. Not one round less,” Wang Fei said angrily.</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss Wang.” Zhou Wen didn’t even try to defend himself. Keeping his arms close to his torso, he jogged upwards.</p>
<p>The Wordless Monument was the boundary of Mount Laojun. Any further up allowed one to see true dimensional creatures. And from that point onwards, there would be animals from Earth that had mutated.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ran up the stone stairs and saw a white antelope standing by the edge of the cliff. It was eating from a blade of grass that grew out of the cliff.</p>
<p>The antelope was snow-white in color with curved horns on its head that looked like carved white jade. It was obvious that it was not an antelope from Earth. On its forehead, there was a vertical eye that was half-open. One could vaguely see a holy white light shimmering within.</p>
<p>In between its four hooves, there was a faint stream of white light swirling about, making it look as though it was walking on the light.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen didn’t know the level of the dimensional creature, he could tell that it was definitely extraordinary.</p>
<p>The antelope also saw Zhou Wen, but it ignored him. It continued eating the grass on the mountain cliff.</p>
<p>The grass grew among the rocks, its leaves withered and yellow. It did not look eye-catching but the antelope was enjoying its meal as though it was delicious.</p>
<p>Mount Laojun’s dimensional creature didn’t harm others, so Zhou Wen wasn’t worried that the antelope would attack him. He approached it curiously and carefully observed the withered yellow grass growing from the cliff.</p>
<p>The grass was split into five leaves. A leaf was only the length of a middle finger. It was yellow and withered as if it was about to die.</p>
<p>But in the middle of the leaf, there was a white flower. It was about the size of a fingernail and looked as if it was carved from jade.</p>
<p>The antelope bit down on the withered grass and flower and chewed repeatedly before swallowing them down. Its face was filled with bliss as though it was extremely satisfied.</p>
<p>The antelope was only able to eat withered grass that was relatively close to the steep cliffs. Zhou Wen looked at the mountain cliff and saw that there wasn’t much withered grass. An idea couldn’t help but come to him.</p>
<p>He leaped up and stepped on the mountain cliff with his toes, swirling around like a huge bird. It was none other than the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill he had just learned.</p>
<p>He grabbed a withered yellow grass in midair and yanked at it forcefully; however, it remained motionless. With Zhou Wen’s Strength, he was surprisingly unable to pull the grass out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held onto the grass with one hand while his body hung in midair. He turned his head and glanced at the antelope and saw that it had no intention of attacking him. As it chewed on the withered grass, it looked at Zhou Wen, with a rather odd expression as though it was mocking him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen made two more attempts with all his strength, but the withered grass remained motionless. The leaf didn’t show any signs of tearing. It was hard to imagine its tenacity.</p>
<p>This withered grass is actually so tenacious. I’m afraid there’s something odd about it. Zhou Wen had learned from textbooks that many dimensional zones had strange plants with various magical powers.</p>
<p>Some plants could cause instant death from consuming them while others could increase a human’s physical fitness greatly by eating them. They could even break through and evolve to a different level.</p>
<p>Since the three-eyed antelope was eating such withered grass, it meant that it wasn’t poisonous. As for whether humans could eat it or not, Zhou Wen didn’t know.</p>
<p>Seeing that he couldn’t pluck out the grass, Zhou Wen changed his mind and summoned the Lotus Flower Ant’s bracer. Pieces of bone that resembled lotus flower petals wrapped around Zhou Wen’s left arm, forming the razor-like blades along his arm as his fingernails became as sharp as a blade,</p>
<p>raz</p>
<p>came</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thrust his fingers forward as though he was cutting tofu and stabbed into the stone cliff. He hurriedly dug a few times and snapped the rocks around the grass and dug it out.</p>
<p>Upon landing back on the stone stairs, Zhou Wen was unable to make head or tail. He had no choice but to put the grass back into his backpack. When he turned his head, he realized that the remaining withered grass had already been devoured by the three-eyed antelope.</p>
<p>He was only curious at first, so he didn’t think much of it as he continued running up the mountain.</p>
<p>Mount Laojun was known as the safest dimensional zone and as long as he didn’t cross Golden Peak’s gates, there wouldn’t be any danger. Even if a human wanted to kill Zhou Wen, they typically wouldn’t choose a place like Mount Laojun.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen jogged as he surveyed his surroundings but failed to see any tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>As he ran, Zhou Wen suddenly felt his back tighten as though someone was pulling him from behind. He couldn’t help but be alarmed as he hurriedly turned his head and saw the three-eyed antelope biting his backpack.</p>
<h3 id='chapter103'>Chapter 103 Revenge</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen could tell that the three-eyed antelope wasn’t using much force. Since its bite could chew through the tenacious withered grass, his backpack would have been torn to pieces if it exerted a little strength. It wouldn’t remain in one piece as it was now.</p>
<p>The antelope bit on the zipper in an attempt to unzip it. It most likely had its sights on the withered grass that Zhou Wen had dug up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took off his backpack and carried it as he continued walking up the mountain with his back facing the three-eyed antelope. After all, Mount Laojun’s dimensional creatures weren’t violent, so he wasn’t afraid it would do something to him.</p>
<p>The antelope clearly wasn’t giving up as it circled Zhou Wen and attempted to reach its head into his backpack.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only constantly move his backpack around to dodge the antelope’s head. Without trying, its speed was surprisingly fast. The moment Zhou Wen failed to focus, it had pulled open the zipper of his backpack.</p>
<p>This three-eyed antelope is no ordinary mortal. If it wants to eat the withered grass so much, the grass must be extraordinary. With this in mind, Zhou Wen hurriedly hugged his backpack tightly and pressed down the hole.</p>
<p>The three-eyed antelope didn’t give up either. It buried its head deep into Zhou Wen’s embrace, steeling its heart to eat the grass in his backpack.</p>
<p>Although the three-eyed antelope didn’t use brute force, its strength, speed, and reflexes were much better than Zhou Wen’s. Unable to tussle against it, the three-eyed antelope was close to succeeding.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt indignant, but ignoring how violence was not allowed on Mount Laojun, wouldn’t have dared fight the antelope even if he could</p>
<p>The withered grass had already been revealed. Just as the antelope was about to bite onto it, Zhou Wen suddenly thought of something as he spat at it.</p>
<p>Saliva sprayed onto the withered grass, covering its surface with spots of foamy saliva.</p>
<p>The antelope, who already had its mouth open, was taken aback. It looked at the withered grass covered in saliva before looking at Zhou Wen, its expression extremely odd.</p>
<p>“Do you still want it? I’m taking it away if you don’t want to eat it.” Zhou Wen spread open his backpack generously, but the antelope didn’t react at all. All it did was look at the withered grass with a conflicted look.</p>
<p>Seeing no response from it, Zhou Wen zipped up his backpack, slung it on his back, and ran up the mountain.</p>
<p>The scenery of Mount Laojun was truly impressive; unfortunately, Zhou Wen didn’t see the palm symbol.</p>
<p>Although the antelope didn’t eat the withered grass, it didn’t leave either. It slowly followed behind Zhou Wen without any intention of attacking him. He didn’t know what it was up to.</p>
<p>Mount Laojun wasn’t very high, but after the dimensional storms, the space on the mountaintop seemed to be dilated. Despite the mountain looking short, Zhou Wen ran for quite some time before he gradually approached the mountaintop.</p>
<p>From afar, he could see the scenery of the mountain peak. There were ancient buildings of various heights dotted on it. Although the buildings weren’t majestic, they were built on the peak of the mountain with clouds clinging around them. They resembled the immortal residences as spoken of in myths.</p>
<p>At the end of the stone stairs, there was a wooden structure that resembled a gateway. On it were the words “Central Heaven Gateway.”</p>
<p>In front of the gateway was a stone statue-an elderly man riding on the back of a stone cow. His gaze was trained towards the firmaments, but the stone cow had its head turned towards the horizon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had read the information on Mount Laojun before coming. He knew that the stone statue was likely the founder of Daoism, Li Er.</p>
<p>Before the dimensional storms, although Mount Laojun was a scenic spot, it wasn’t developed too well. This resulted in few tourists. Instead, it was common for locals to scale the mountain to see the sunrise over the sea of clouds from Golden Peak.</p>
<p>From the information, the stone sculpture had been recently sculpted, so there was likely nothing odd about it. However, when Zhou Wen approached it, the mysterious phone vibrated.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly took out his mysterious phone and activated the camera function. Soon, he locked onto the stone cow’s forehead. There was the familiar palm symbol.</p>
<p>I’ve finally found it! Zhou Wen was overjoyed.</p>
<p>Before coming to Mount Laojun, Wang Fei had repeatedly exhorted everyone not to cross Central Heaven Gateway. If they did, they would have to bear the consequences themselves.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wouldn’t have dared venture deeper if he couldn’t find the palm symbol.</p>
<p>The phone screen showed that he had finished downloading the Mount Laojun dungeon. Just as Zhou Wen was reeling in delight, he suddenly felt a force slam into his back. He involuntarily flew up.</p>
<p>The force was immense, making it impossible for Zhou Wen to control his strength. However, the force was extremely strange. Although it was heavy, it didn’t injure Zhou Wen’s muscles or bone. All he could do was fly involuntarily towards Central Heaven Gateway.</p>
<p>In midair, Zhou Wen turned his head to take a glance, only to see that the three-eyed antelope was standing watching. It was giving him a nefarious smile.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t. Wasn’t it said that Mount Laojun’s dimensional creatures are docile? To think that the three-eyed antelope holds such grudges, taking revenge in a blink of an eye. One really can’t believe in rumors. Zhou Wen thought unhappily.</p>
<p>He had always been wary of the three-eyed antelope, but he hadn’t heard any sound before he was sent flying.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen slammed through Central Heaven Gateway and when he landed on the ground, he immediately bounced to his feet and attempted to rush out.</p>
<p>However, he was taken aback when he looked back. He had clearly crossed the gateway with the words “Central Heaven Gateway,” but when he looked back, he realized that the gateway, along with the stone sculpture and stairs were gone. He was by the side of a hanging cliff with clouds swirling around.</p>
<p>Is this an illusion? Zhou Wen carefully headed to the edge of the cliff and looked down. A gust of the mountain wind blew and nearly blew him off the edge.</p>
<p>“Meh!” A goat’s cry sounded from nearby. Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly turned his head and saw the three-eyed antelope standing on a nearby boulder, looking at him mockingly.</p>
<p>In this day and age, you can’t even offend an antelope. Zhou Wen licked his lips and ignored it before glancing at his phone.</p>
<p>He finally understood what was happening. The three-eyed antelope didn’t dare harm him on the mountaintop, so it had struck him, throwing him onto Golden Peak, hoping to use its forces to finish him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen made up his mind not to head forward. He stood there and waited. Then, he used his phone to scout the way to see what oddities lay ahead on Golden Peak.</p>
<p>There was no more downloading notice on the phone screen. On its home screen, there was an icon of a stone cow. On it were the words “Mount Laojun.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was just about to click on the Mount Laojun icon when he felt something amiss.</p>
<p>The hair follicles in his pores began to grow thicker and longer. They even sprouted leaves, turning him into a humanoid grass field. It left him alarmed.</p>
<p>No good! Zhou Wen was alarmed as his mind raced. He instantly thought of the new Primordial Energy Art he had learned from the Wordless Monument and quickly switched from the Lost Immortal Sutra to it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter104'>Chapter 104 Three Talismans</h3>
<p>The moment the Wordless Monument’s Primordial Energy Art was activated, the grass sprouting on Zhou Wen immediately stopped growing. Furthermore, it gradually began to recede. Soon, Zhou Wen’s body returned to normal.</p>
<p>The three-eyed antelope wore a look of surprise when it saw this. It stood nearby and sized up Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Primordial Energy Art of the Wordless Monument works. Zhou Wen heaved a long sigh of relief. He turned his head and saw that the area he came from remained a steep cliff and not the gateway he came from.</p>
<p>Forget it. I’ll find a way out in-game. Since there’s the Wordless Monument’s Primordial Energy Art, there shouldn’t be too much danger as long as that antelope doesn’t find trouble with me. Zhou Wen’s heart jumped for joy when he subconsciously looked at the antelope.</p>
<p>The antelope who had been standing nearby just moments ago was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>“Meh!” A bleat sounded from behind Zhou Wen, causing him to break out into a cold sweat. Turning his head, he indeed saw the antelope standing behind him, its eyes sizing him up.</p>
<p>That was not all. As it sized him up, it circled around him as though he wanted to take in every inch of his body clearly, unwilling to miss out any detail.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what it was up to. He went on full alert for he wasn’t going to just sit back and do nothing if the antelope really wanted to harm him even if he knew he was no match for it.</p>
<p>However, it had no intention of taking action. It circled Zhou Wen a few times as the puzzlement in its eyes intensified.</p>
<p>“Brother Antelope, let’s negotiate. I’ll wash that blade of grass and return it to you. Why don’t you live and let live?” Zhou Wen carefully said to the three-eyed antelope.</p>
<p>If he knew that the antelope would be so vengeful, he wouldn’t have dug up the grass.</p>
<p>The antelope ignored him as it moved closer and nudged him to walk inside with its head.</p>
<p>The antelope had great strength, so much so that Zhou Wen felt that his strength couldn’t put up any resistance. Being pushed by that force, he couldn’t help but walk in.</p>
<p>Countless thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind, but he ultimately didn’t risk his life by fighting with the antelope.</p>
<p>The ancient buildings on top of Golden Peak were extremely large. They were connected by stone bridges. Beneath the stone bridges was a swirling sea of clouds and walking over them made one feel like they were walking in the sky.</p>
<p>“Brother Antelope, where are you pushing me? Can’t I walk on my own?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>The three-eyed antelope seemed to understand what he said and stopped nudging him with its head. It bleated at him before walking off.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that his Speed and Strength were inferior to that of the antelope as it was likely an Epic creature, so it wasn’t realistic for him to escape under its nose. All he could do was follow it.</p>
<p>The antelope led him through the ancient buildings, passing under many stone bridges before arriving at a Daoist temple. Zhou Wen focused his gaze and saw that the signboard had the words “Great Pure Temple.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had a superficial knowledge of Daoism, but he didn’t know that Great Pure One was one of the Three Pure Ones— Jade Pure One, Supreme Pure One, and Great Pure One. Among them, the Great Pure One was the most famous, also known as Taishang Laojun. It was probably a name everyone in East District was aware of.</p>
<p>This Daoist temple’s name was Great Pure Temple, so it was definitely meant to consecrate Taishang Laojun.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me that Taishang Laojun is still living here? When Zhou Wen recalled his encounter at the Small Buddha Temple, he couldn’t help but increase his circulation speed of the Wordless Monument’s Primordial Energy Art.</p>
<p>The antelope came to the entrance of the Great Pure Temple but didn’t enter. With a flash of its figure, it was already behind Zhou Wen and, before he even realized what was happening, it had pushed him into the temple.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already mentally prepared so he wasn’t surprised. The antelope definitely wasn’t taking him to sightsee when it led him here.</p>
<p>Standing firm, Zhou Wen studied the situation within. Beyond the door was a compound that looked rather old. The ground was covered in dust and fallen leaves. It was as though no one had stepped foot into it for a thousand years.</p>
<p>In fact, what Zhou Wen knew was that before the dimensional storms, Great Pure Temple enjoyed plenty of incense offerings. And that was only decades ago.</p>
<p>“Since you are a disciple of my Daoist school. You can choose any of the Three Pure Talismans on the table.” An ancient voice rang out from an unknown location, resounding inside Great Pure Temple as though it came from every direction. It was impossible to tell where the source came from.</p>
<p>“Yes, Master.” Zhou Wen didn’t dare hesitate. After bowing, his gaze landed on an offering table in the yard.</p>
<p>After he passed through the door, he saw three talismans on the offering table. They looked completely different in material. One was like flawless white jade, while the second was made of metal, and the last one was carved from wood.</p>
<p>The three talismans were the size of a palm with similar appearances. However, the runic patterns on them were different.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t read the runes since he had a limited understanding of Daoism. He could only make half-baked guesses. Small Buddha Temple’s three-faced Buddha made me choose a Mythical Companion Egg, but I’m made to choose talismans here. I wonder which one is useful. This is Great Pure Temple, so logically speaking, the three talismans should be related to Taishang Laojun. However, that might not be the case. Daoism’s Three Pure Ones were one embodiment to begin with, so the three talismans might represent the Three Pure Ones.</p>
<p>If my guess is correct, then the jade talisman represents the Jade Pure One, Lord of Primordial Beginning. The wooden talisman has something to do with nature, so it likely represents Taishang Laojun. As for the golden talisman, it should represent the Supreme Pure One. Which one should I choose? Zhou Wen was just making random guesses, so it wasn’t as though he knew if he was correct.</p>
<p>However, from an aesthetic point of view, he would have taken the jade talisman. But upon realizing that he was at Great Pure Temple, he hesitated for a moment before taking the wooden talisman.</p>
<p>The instant Zhou Wen picked up the wooden talisman, he saw the projection in front of him, transform. Like a dream, Great Pure Temple dissipated. When Zhou Wen’s vision returned to normal, he realized that he had already returned to the spot beside the stone sculpture of an elderly man riding on the back of a cow.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for the wooden charm in his hand, Zhou Wen would have wondered if he had been dreaming.</p>
<p>“Meh!” A bleat sounded. Upon seeing the three-eyed antelope, Zhou Wen confirmed everything that had happened was no illusion.</p>
<p>He didn’t dare stay here any longer. Although Mount Laojun’s Golden Peak wasn’t as strange as Small Buddha Temple, it left Zhou Wen apprehensive as he ran down the mountain with the wooden talisman in hand.</p>
<p>When he reached the halfway point and saw Wang Fei and his classmates, Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, I told you to run. Were you off merrymaking?? Why did you bring an antelope back?” Wang Fei frowned when she saw Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>He turned his head and saw that the three-eyed antelope had followed him down. However, the vertical eye on its forehead had vanished. Apart from its whiteness, it looked no different from an ordinary white antelope.</p>
<p>Wang Fei originally imagined that it was an Earth animal that had mutated on Mount Laojun, not expecting it to be a dimensional creature. After all, dimensional creatures weren’t able to step past the Wordless Monument.</p>
<h3 id='chapter105'>Chapter 105 The Antelope That Just Won’t Leave</h3>
<p>At the Special Investigation Bureau’s dedicated hospital.</p>
<p>“Liz, answer me honestly. Is there anything you exaggerated in the report you submitted?” Qiao Siyuan asked with a grave expression.</p>
<p>“Minister, I’ve been strictly trained in intelligence. I know the importance of correct intelligence. I can guarantee that the report I wrote has no exaggerations or falsehoods. I can be responsible for every word in it.” Liz struggled to get up as she was pushed down by Qiao Siyuan.</p>
<p>“You have just received treatment. Only by recuperating and being able to move can you have what it takes to continue fighting.” Qiao Siyuan placated Liz and flipped through her report. “I have already done thorough investigations and have confirmed that there’s a mysterious stone tablet in Small Buddha Temple. It’s like the other lands of mystery. No one can master the Primordial Energy Art on the stone monument unless that person possesses the special physique that matches</p>
<p>it.”</p>
<p>“In that case, that Zhou Wen…” The mere thought of Zhou Wen made Liz immediately clench her teeth.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for Zhou Wen, she wouldn’t have been injured, much less have her sea of energy destroyed.</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan nodded slightly. “According to your report, he was able to enter the temple hall without being harmed. As for you, you had Headless Angel to protect you; yet, you were nearly killed. This means there are only two possibilities. First, it’s that he has a guardian Companion Beast that’s stronger than Headless Angel, protecting him from harm. The other possibility is that he possesses a special physique that matches Small Buddha Temple, preventing him from being attacked. I’m inclined towards the latter.”</p>
<p>Liz said hatefully, “The An family must have known that Zhou Wen had a special physique. That’s why they view him in a different light and gave him An Jing’s candidacy at all costs. If by a stroke of luck, he has obtained another special physique, having two talents on him, it won’t be impossible for him to have a chance to break through to the Mythical realm. The An family has really made their plans. I think Ouyang Lan and Zhou Lingfeng’s marriage was probably just a transaction.”</p>
<p>At the thought of the An family, Liz also gritted her teeth in hatred. She was the daughter of a Senator after all; yet, An Tianzuo had her sea of energy crippled. She had to have her revenge.</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan said plainly, “The impact dimensional zones have in various parts of the world is growing more obvious. It results in the barriers between territories growing, therefore impeding movement. The factions from these territories have always been trying to use this opportunity to extricate themselves from the League’s control. The An family is filled with ambition and they have a Primordial Gold mine while they have been nurturing their army. They are also using all kinds of means to seek out a way to break through to the Mythical stage. Their ambition knows no bounds.”</p>
<p>“Minister, we can’t let the An family continue. We have to nip Zhou Wen in the bud. As long as the An family doesn’t have a Mythical expert, they will have scruples and won’t easily betray and abandon the League,” Liz said excitedly.</p>
<p>“Calm down. You haven’t recovered from your injuries.” After placating Liz’s emotions, Qiao Siyuan continued, “Let’s not talk about whether Zhou Wen was intentionally nurtured by the An family, just the fact that he has a special physique implies he needs to come under the League’s service. He cannot become a private tool of the An family. However, Luoyang is ultimately the An family’s territory. After what happened the previous time, they will definitely enhance their protection of him. It’s probably impossible to touch him in Luoyang.”</p>
<p>“Are we just going to watch the An family do whatever they want?” Liz said angrily.</p>
<p>“Of course not. However, everything depends on the ways and methods employed. The League needs the An family’s supply of Primordial Gold Ore so we can’t touch them for now. However, since Zhou Wen obtained a nomination, he will definitely be sent to our League’s holy grounds and lose the protection of the An family. From there, it will be a lot easier for us to bring him back,” Qiao Siyuan said indifferently.</p>
<p>“We let him off. He can live for a few more days,” Liz said hatefully.</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan exhorted again. “For now, don’t tell anyone about Zhou Wen’s special physique. It’s best if there aren’t any external complications.”</p>
<p>“Minister, don’t worry. I understand what needs to be done.” Liz nodded slightly.</p>
<p>Having a special physique had wide implications. Even in the Senate, there were different voices. The various factions also treated special physiques seriously. If other factions knew that Zhou Wen possessed a special physique, it would likely be impossible for them to control the situation’s development, something Liz and Qiao Siyuan least wanted to happen.</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan was thinking about work, but Liz only wanted to finish off Zhou Wen personally.</p>
<p>In the Four Seasons Garden dorms, Zhou Wen sat on a chair and stared at the white antelope.</p>
<p>This antelope had been following him ever since he returned from Mount Laojun. It even squeezed into the college bus and returned to the college with him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen really wished to chase the creature away, but he knew how terrifying the antelope was. If he forcefully chased it away, it was possible that it would explode with rage and slaughter someone. When that happened, not only would it affect Zhou Wen, even his fellow classmates and teacher would be down on their luck.</p>
<p>Therefore, even though Zhou Wen wished to chase away the antelope, he didn’t forcefully drive it away.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it was normal for students to use Companion Beasts at Sunset College, so it wasn’t too shocking for Zhou Wen to bring one back. However, Li Xuan and the other students didn’t cease mocking him on the way back.</p>
<p>“I say, Zhou Wen, your luck is pretty good. A pet automatically recognizes you as its owner. Unfortunately, this is only an antelope that mutated on Mount Laojun and not a high-level dimensional creature. If this fellow was an Epic dimensional creature, that would be awesome. It’s really a pity.” Back when Li Xuan said those words, it was naturally a jibe at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen knew very well that the fellow definitely had powers at the Epic stage.</p>
<p>“Brother Antelope, I’ve washed your grass. Eat it with ease. I’ve used green, natural, uncontaminated cleaning fluid to wash it more than ten times. It’s clean. Quickly finish it and go on your merry way. A place like school has too much dust and the pollution is terrible. There are all kinds of people here and there’s all kinds of noise pollution. It’s nothing comparable to a place like Mount Laojun. It must be hard on you living here. It’s best you return.” Zhou Wen placed the withered grass on the table in front of the antelope as he persuaded it sincerely.</p>
<p>Glancing at the withered grass on the table, it didn’t even sniff it but turned around and walked to the couch. It then lay on the couch and squinted its eyes comfortably.</p>
<p>“Brother Antelope, although you are indeed impressive, you should know that this is Sunset College. Many Epic experts are stationed here. If they discover that you are a feral dimensional creature, I’m afraid…” Zhou Wen had planned on reasoning with it when he realized that emotional appeal didn’t work.</p>
<p>To his surprise, the antelope had fallen asleep on the couch as though it hadn’t heard Zhou Wen at all.</p>
<h3 id='chapter106'>Chapter 106 Entering Mount Laojun Again</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a little troubled, but he couldn’t think of a way to chase the antelope away. All he could do was let it occupy his couch.</p>
<p>I’ll take my time to think of a solution. Zhou Wen returned to his room and closed the door before lying in bed. Only then did he take out his mysterious phone and open the Mount Laojun dungeon.</p>
<p>He wanted to see if he could enter Great Pure Temple in-game again and choose another talisman.</p>
<p>The last time he entered Small Buddha Temple in-game, he got Truth Listener from it. Later, he went to Small Buddha Temple in real life, but he didn’t discover anything. He did not even awaken the three-faced Buddha.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen believed that it was likely that the three-faced Buddha had sensed Truth Listener on him, so the chance to choose wasn’t given.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen first placed the wooden talisman he had chosen to the side and locked it up in a box. Only then did he turn on his phone and enter the game dungeon of Mount Laojun.</p>
<p>The environment of the game’s Mount Laojun dungeon was identical to the real Mount Laojun. But the dungeon started directly from the spot with the cow statue which had the elderly man riding on it.</p>
<p>The moment the blood-colored avatar entered the game, it stepped through the Central Heaven Gateway.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t switch to the Wordless Monument’s Primordial Energy Art in the beginning. Instead, he used the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, but once he entered, grass grew crazily on him with nothing capable of stopping it.</p>
<p>He hurriedly switched to the Wordless Monument’s Primordial Energy Art, allowing the blood-colored avatar to gradually return to normal.</p>
<p>It indeed shares the same logic with Small Buddha Temple. One has to master the corresponding Primordial Energy Art to enter as they please or death awaits them. Zhou Wen had roughly understood the rules of the mysterious lands.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to Zhou Wen, people with Buddhist and Daoist physiques could enter Small Buddha Temple and Mount Laojun unscathed without practicing the respective Primordial Energy Arts.</p>
<p>The reason Zhou Wen needed to master the Primordial Energy Art to come and go freely was that he didn’t have a special physique. It was solely because the Lost Immortal Sutra’s power confused those terrifying existences, allowing Zhou Wen to retrieve the benefits that only people with special physiques could obtain.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the real difference between Zhou Wen and those with special physiques was that those with special physiques, like a Buddhist body, could only enter a place like Small Buddha Temple. They were no different from ordinary people when entering Mount Laojun, so there were no benefits to be reaped.</p>
<p>The Lost Immortal Sutra’s powers allowed Zhou Wen to mimic all kinds of physiques and obtain the benefits he couldn’t otherwise obtain.</p>
<p>The Mount Laojun pavilions in-game were above the clouds, making them look like a heavenly palace.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t just casually walk around. His memory was pretty good, so he still remembered the path that the antelope had taken while leading him. He followed the route according to his memories.</p>
<p>However, he had only walked a short distance when he saw an immortal crane with a red top. The immortal crane was standing on a rock railing by the side of the bridge, its snow-white feathers seemingly engraved from jade. It suffused a glittering divine glow, an obvious indication that it wasn’t an ordinary creature of Earth.</p>
<p>The game seems a little different from reality. I didn’t see any other dimensional creatures when I followed the antelope! Zhou Wen looked warily at the immortal crane, unsure if it would attack him.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was pondering over it, reality gave him the cruelest answer. The immortal crane opened its mouth and sucked at the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly controlled the blood-colored avatar to summon its Companion Beasts to engage in battle, but he had no chance. The blood-colored avatar and its Companion Beasts were sucked into the immortal crane’s mouth before the game screen went black.</p>
<p>The immortal crane is probably a top Epic creature, right? Zhou Wen helplessly put down his phone. The immortal crane was simply too powerful and Zhou Wen’s present Strength was insufficient for him to challenge it, or rather, he was unqualified to fight it. Making another trip was useless.</p>
<p>I’ll do some research and see what uses that wooden talisman has. Zhou Wen had already given up on entering Mount Laojun. There was no way he could gain anything from that area before he advanced to the Epic stage.</p>
<p>Taking the wooden talisman out of the box, it felt warm to the touch. It was as if a refreshing energy was emitting from it, jolting his mind.</p>
<p>How do I use it? Zhou Wen attempted to circulate the Wordless Monument’s Primordial Energy Art before injecting his Primordial Energy into the talisman.</p>
<p>When using the item forms of his Companion Beasts, this was typically how it was done. All Zhou Wen could do was give it a try.</p>
<p>However, the moment his Primordial Energy entered the wooden talisman, the runes on it lit up. Then, Zhou Wen felt like the wooden talisman had turned into a huge pump that was draining his Primordial Energy as it flowed to the wooden talisman.Read the next chapter on our vipnovel.com</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt pain all over his body as his mind nearly exploded. In an instant, his Primordial Energy was completely drained.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was too familiar with this feeling. It was the feeling of incubating a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Could it be that… The wooden talisman is actually a Companion Egg! Just as this thought surfaced in Zhou Wen’s mind, the wooden talisman in his hand transformed into a sliver of refreshing energy that imprinted on his palm.</p>
<p>The excruciating pain vanished at that moment as Zhou Wen slumped to the ground, panting heavily.</p>
<p>Although it was only for a brief moment, Zhou Wen felt the fat in his cheeks disappear and his eyeballs were almost tearing out of his sockets.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he recovered a lot faster after cultivating the Wordless Monument’s Primordial Energy Art. Even if he didn’t use Primordial Energy Crystals, his Primordial Energy would recover quite significantly after some rest. It made Zhou Wen feel a lot better.</p>
<p>When he raised his palm, he saw a leaf tattoo. The leaf was green and looked like jadeite. There were some crystal-clear white veins in it that looked like they were formed from frost.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen already had information about the Companion Beast appear in his mind. This information was typically only obtained after contracting a Companion Beast. Based on the very vague information, he had no way of understanding the Companion Beast in detail.</p>
<p>Thus, he still took out his mysterious phone and dripped a drop of blood onto the screen before looking through the blood-colored avatar’s stats.</p>
<p>Indeed, there was an additional Companion Beast on the blood-colored avatar’s stats.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy: Mortal (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Strength: 11</p>
<p>Speed: 11</p>
<p>Constitution: 11</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 11</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Grand Yin Wind</p>
<p>Companion Form: Fan</p>
<p>Its stats are the same as Truth Listener, but why is there only one talent skill? Truth Listener at least has four. For a Companion Beast of the same grade, there should be at least two or three, right? Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>Although this Companion Beast could evolve to the Mythical stage in the future, who knew how long it would take to nurture it. Its present stats were still more important. A single skill was clearly inferior to having four skills in terms of usefulness.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen summoned the Banana Fairy to see what kind of Companion Beast it was.</p>
<h3 id='chapter107'>Chapter 107 Banana Fairy</h3>
<p>A green light flashed as an adorable palm-sized, green-dressed girl appeared in front of Zhou Wen. She sat on a jadeite-like banana leaf floating in mid-air like a boat swaying above the lake under the moonlight.</p>
<p>Why are all Mythical Companion Beasts so small in size? Zhou Wen extended his hand and beckoned to Banana Fairy. The girl, along with the banana leaf, flew over and landed in Zhou Wen’s hand, turning into a petite green fan.</p>
<p>The fan was only the size of Zhou Wen’s palm and the leaf was crystalline-like jadeite. Its design was also extremely exquisite and beautiful, but it was a little too small.</p>
<p>It’s so tiny. Isn’t it a joke to use it as a weapon? Zhou Wen looked around and felt that using the tiny fan as a weapon wasn’t suitable at all. Furthermore, he had never learned how to fight with a fan.</p>
<p>However, he soon realized that Banana Fairy and other Companion Beasts were somewhat different. Typical Companion Beasts couldn’t use their talent skills when they were in their companion form, but a Banana Fairy actually could.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the tiny fan and flapped at a sandbag meant for training. Immediately, an invisible gust of wind blew over, shaking the sandbag left and right.</p>
<p>Is that all? Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed. Although the winds were strong, they were not considered fantastic. They didn’t seem to have much destructive force.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out to press down on the swaying sandbag and was slightly taken aback. When his fingers touched the sandbag, he realized that it was covered in a layer of frost. The spot his fingers had touched was ice-cold.</p>
<p>Grand Yin Wind has wintry effects, but such coldness isn’t enough to kill an opponent, right? With this in mind, Zhou Wen suddenly thought of something. Grand Yin Wind is a wintry wind, so will it be able to repress the Fire God Platform’s firebirds? If so, wouldn’t I be able to reach its peak?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have much hope regarding his random thought. After all, the Banana Fairy was only at the Mortal stage. Even if she advanced to the Mythical stage in the future, her standards now weren’t comparable to top Legendary Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>As for the firebirds, each of them had strength at the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>Despite having such thoughts, Zhou Wen still launched the Ancient Imperial City dungeon on the mysterious phone. He planned on testing out his theory by heading to the Fire God Platform. If the Grand Yin Wind could really suppress the firebirds, he wouldn’t do it as all he needed to do was nurture her to the Legendary stage. By then, scaling Fire God Platform wouldn’t be a difficult task.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been grinding at Ancient Imperial City countless times. He had once again arrived in front of Fire God Platform and ridden the Silver-Winged Flying Ant up the stairs. Soon, a firebird flew down from the Fire God Platform.</p>
<p>Seeing a firebird fly down, the blood-colored avatar clenched the banana fan tightly, aimed it at the incoming firebird, and produced Grand Yin Wind.</p>
<p>A gust of cold wind blew at the firebird, making it look like a fire plume that fell into the water. It instantly extinguished, leaving no trace behind.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared with his mouth agape. He couldn’t help but hug his phone and give it two kisses. What a treasure. The Grand Yin Wind is so effective against firebirds. I have a chance of scaling the Fire God Platform.</p>
<p>Another two firebirds flew down from the Fire God Platform. Zhou Wen ordered the blood-colored avatar to flap the fan, again and again, using the same Grand Yin Wind skill.</p>
<p>However, before the Grand Yin Wind appeared, the game system notified: ‘Insufficient Primordial Energy to release Grand Yin Wind.’</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, does Banana Fairy’s Primordial Energy only have enough for one use of Grand Yin Wind? Zhou Wen hurriedly controlled the blood-colored avatar to rush down Fire God Platform. Without the Grand Yin Wind, there was no way he could rush up using the blood-colored avatar’s capabilities alone.</p>
<p>After finding a safe spot, Zhou Wen began researching the Banana Fairy and Grand Yin Wind skill. Indeed, the former’s Primordial Energy had been expended, leaving nothing behind.</p>
<p>After grinding a round of Skeleton Soldiers and having their Primordial Energy Crystals drop, Zhou Wen filled up the Banana Fairy’s Primordial Energy and got her to use Grand Yin Wind once. Indeed, her eleven points of Primordial Energy were depleted immediately.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen made the Banana Fairy turn into a fan, attempting to infuse his Primordial Energy into it to see if he could use the Grand Yin Wind.</p>
<p>He was able to use it, but his 11 points of Primordial Energy were instantly drained, leaving not an iota behind.</p>
<p>With my Primordial Energy, I can only use the Grand Yin Wind twice in a short period of time. Can I rush up the Fire God Platform only relying on two uses of Grand Yin Wind? Zhou Wen frowned in thought.</p>
<p>The Grand Yin Wind is an area-of-effect Primordial Energy Skill. If I can lure the firebirds into a certain range, it’s not impossible to get rid of a large number of firebirds at once. If used properly, I might be able to rush to the top with just two uses. Zhou Wen inwardly made plans.</p>
<p>With the hope of ascending Fire God Platform, Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate to try it. With the help of the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s Speed and flight and Zhou Wen’s Dragon Gate Fairy Skill, the blood-colored avatar charged all the way up while consciously luring the firebirds in a particular direction.</p>
<p>This was because Banana Fairy was only at the Mortal stage, greatly limiting the range of the Grand Yin Wind. To eliminate the firebirds as best as possible, he had to try his best to bunch them in a certain spot.</p>
<p>More than ten firebirds were led to a spot by Zhou Wen. Almost reaching his limit, Zhou Wen no longer hesitated. He ordered the blood-colored avatar to hold the banana fan and gently fan the firebirds.</p>
<p>The firebirds were instantly extinguished by the Grand Yin Wind. Only two firebirds that were not within the Grand Yin Wind’s range, managed to survive.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted as he controlled the blood-colored avatar to continue charging up Fire God Platform.</p>
<p>With more than half the distance traversed, a firebird horde erupted from Fire God Platform, blotting out the sky as they charged down like a fiery cloud.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar once again activated its Grand Yin Wind skill and fanned the fiery cloud. Immediately, a large hole was blown through the cloud with the Grand Yin Wind. An unknown number of firebirds were blown to nothingness.</p>
<p>Using this opportunity, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant spread its four wings and passed through the hole and continued charging up. The firebird horde behind it swept back and closed the hole, chasing after the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.</p>
<p>The Silver-Winged Flying Ant wasn’t able to fly at a high altitude in one fell swoop. When it reached its apex, the blood-colored avatar jumped on its back and leaped up in the sky like a hawk hovering above Fire God Platform with the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen finally saw the complete Fire God Platform. Apart from a stone monument with the Ancient Imperial Sutra, there was a stone furnace in front of it. The flames in the furnace flickered as the firebirds flew out of it.</p>
<p>At that moment, a large flock of firebirds shot out from the furnace. Zhou Wen ignored them as his gaze landed on the Ancient Imperial Sutra’s stone monument, trying to memorize a few words.</p>
<p>After memorizing about eight words, the flock of firebird had surrounded him and the game screen quickly went black.</p>
<p>With seven or eight words each time, I wonder how many times it will take for me to memorize the complete Ancient Imperial Sutra. Zhou Wen dripped his blood and revived himself as he entered the game once again.</p>
<h3 id='chapter108'>Chapter 108 Xiyuan Crystal shop</h3>
<p>Wang Fei had been in a bad mood recently. Based on her plan, Zhou Wen should have been motivated to diligently cultivate after staring at the Unwinding Monument.</p>
<p>However, although it was true that Zhou Wen was motivated, it was towards gaming and not cultivation.</p>
<p>You clearly have such great talent. Why do you want to be a loser that is obsessed with gaming? Wang Fei was completely perplexed by Zhou Wen’s thoughts.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, relying on external forces won’t do. I have to give him some stimulation. Wang Fei thought about how to inspire Zhou Wen and make him get back on his feet again.</p>
<p>However, after much thought, she was momentarily unable to think of a good solution. Wang Fei knew that one couldn’t rush or force education. To change a student’s mindset would require a suitable opportunity.</p>
<p>Hence, she planned on observing for a period of time and waiting until Sunset College’s first comprehensive test before making any plans.</p>
<p>There was a single comprehensive examination that every student had to take, regardless of seniority, one month after school began. All the students in each class and grade would have to take part in the exam. The test was uniform and it determined a student’s ranking in school.</p>
<p>Wang Fei felt that Zhou Wen might be inspired if he were to see the true strength of the college’s top students.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s life was ordinary and fulfilling. He crazily grinded daily at dungeons before committing suicide at Fire God Platform to memorize a few words of the Ancient Imperial Sutra.</p>
<p>By now, Zhou Wen hated its length. Despite the numerous times he went up, he had only memorized half of the sutra. It was unknown when he would finish it.</p>
<p>The antelope took up residence in Zhou Wen’s dorm, eating and drinking for free, showing no signs of leaving.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could have just eaten anything without especially heading to the cafeteria, but after this fellow came, it required fresh vegetables daily, forcing him to have no choice but to head to the cafeteria to think of a solution.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to ignore it, but as long as the fellow didn’t eat anything, it would stay by Zhou Wen’s side. It didn’t do anything out of line except circle around Zhou Wen, nudging him with its head, giving him no peace. It was even more impossible to play games, so this forced him to prepare food for it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that his life would continue like this, but Ah Sheng’s arrival had shattered his peaceful life.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, Madam has asked me to take you over there.” Ah Sheng was always so humble and polite. Even a person with a fiery temper would not flare up at him.</p>
<p>“Is there a reason why Sis Lan is looking for me?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown. If there wasn’t anything important, he’d rather not visit the An family again.</p>
<p>“Madam wanted me to tell you that she’s waiting for you at the shop in the city district. She has something private that needs your help,” Ah Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly. Since he wasn’t going to the An family and he didn’t mind Ouyang Lan, he didn’t find making the trip too aversive.</p>
<p>Ah Sheng drove Zhou Wen out of Sunset College. Usually, after school started, students couldn’t leave unless it was a holiday. However, people that Ah Sheng wanted to pick up were clearly not on this list.</p>
<p>After the soldier guarding the door saw the pass Ah Sheng took out, he directly let them through.</p>
<p>Ah Sheng didn’t lie—they really didn’t head for the An family home. Zhou Wen originally imagined that Ouyang Lan would meet him at a restaurant or a cafe, or perhaps a clothing or jewelry shop.</p>
<p>However, when the car stopped, Zhou Wen realized that they had come to a dimensional crystal shop named “Xiyuan.”</p>
<p>He found the name of the dimensional crystal shop a little familiar. After some thought, he recalled that in the delivery package the former principal had sent him, the owner of the name card was the owner of the Xiyuan crystal shop, Qin Xiyuan.</p>
<p>As there hadn’t been any other related incidents since he had received the delivery, Zhou Wen ignored the name card. He only recalled the name card now when he saw the signboard of the Xiyuan dimensional crystal shop.Read the next chapter on our vipnovel.com</p>
<p>I wonder if that string of numbers was casually written on Qin Xiyuan’s name card or if it has anything to do with Qin Xiyuan. Many thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind.</p>
<p>It was impossible for him to show the name card to Qin Xiyuan. Without figuring out what the number on the card meant, Zhou Wen had no intention of letting anyone see it.</p>
<p>“Little Wen, come over quickly.” After the car came to a stop, Ouyang Lan, who was dressed in sports attire, stood on the steps of the shop and beckoned to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen alighted and approached Ouyang Lan. He politely asked, “Sis Lan, how may I help you?”</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan smiled and said, “It’s almost Little Jing’s birthday and I want to give her a Companion Beast as a gift. I want you to give me some advice.”</p>
<p>“Sis Lan, you must be joking. Your understanding of Companion Beasts is definitely greater than mine,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan thought nothing of it. She hooked her arm around Zhou Wen and walked into the shop. “This is a birthday gift, not a piece of equipment used to kill enemies on a battlefield. There’s no need for pragmatism, just aesthetics. To let my Little Jing love it at a glance, I believe young people like you will do a better job than me. So give me some suggestions.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen never guessed Ouyang Lan’s important matter would be this, but since he was already here, he couldn’t just turn around and leave. Besides, Zhou Wen wanted to see what kind of place the Xiyuan crystal shop was.</p>
<p>The staff seemed to know Ouyang Lan and the manager came over personally to greet her.</p>
<p>“Don’t mind us. We are just taking a look,” Ouyang Lan said with a smile.</p>
<p>The manager and salesperson knew better and retreated to the side. Only Ah Sheng maintained a distance behind Ouyang Lan and Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was rather puzzled that they were the only customers in such a huge store. With such terrible sales, it was a miracle how the store managed to continue operating.</p>
<p>As though reading Zhou Wen’s mind, Ouyang Lan said, “Although Xiyuan’s store is not the biggest in Luoyang, it is the store with the most excellent products. It often has trinkets that give one a pleasant surprise. My father and the boss here were childhood friends. He often brought me here when I was young. Before I advanced to the Epic stage, many of my Companion Beasts were bought here. Many of them were also given by Uncle Qin. Back then, the Xiyuan shop wasn’t that big. Every time Father brought me here, Uncle Qin would close the shop by hanging the “on a break” sign before taking my father around to see his latest collection.”</p>
<p>With that said, Zhou Wen roughly understood what Ouyang Lan was getting at. It wasn’t because the business here was bad, but that Ouyang Lan’s arrival made the Xiyuan shop temporarily closed for business.</p>
<p>“However, since Father left Luoyang, I haven’t been here in a long while.” As Ouyang Lan spoke, she walked to a row of lockers and entered a string of codes. She opened one of the lockers and took out a bunch of keys.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t peep at the codes Ouyang Lan had input, but due to Truth Listener on his ear, his hearing was much better than before. When he heard Ouyang Lan enter the code, he knew how many numbers she had entered.</p>
<p>A ten-digit code? Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he subconsciously looked at the locker. He thought, Could the string of numbers on the name card be a storage code here?</p>
<h3 id='chapter109'>Chapter 109 Choosing a Companion Egg</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen looked around and found two rows of lockers nearby. There were at least forty to fifty of them.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that he didn’t know if the ten numbers on the name card were a locker’s code, even if they were, he had no idea which locker the code belonged to.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan held the bunch of keys and said, “In the past, Uncle Qin would always leave the spare key in this locker. If my father came when he wasn’t around, he could use the key to access the Companion Beasts and Companion Eggs. I never expected Uncle Qin to keep this habit despite all these years. Even the code is the same.”</p>
<p>“Did the former principal use a particular locker in the past?” Zhou Wen asked casually.</p>
<p>“Of course, the lockers here are all old-fashioned safe deposit boxes. They aren’t like the public lockers that are popular these days. As long as a code is set, apart from the setter, even Uncle Qin can’t open them. Therefore, the lockers here cannot be used by anyone. Those who can use them are typically old customers or Uncle Qin’s friends.”</p>
<p>As Ouyang Lan spoke, she walked to a locker numbered 42. She said with great nostalgia, “This locker is the one my father uses every time he comes.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s gaze immediately landed on the locker as he thought to himself, Could that string of numbers be Locker No. 42’s code?</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was deep in thought, Ouyang Lan had already reached out her fingers and tapped on the code pad a few times. Then, Locker No. 42 opened.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan had only pressed six digits. Only then did Zhou Wen realize that the codes weren’t necessarily ten digits. It was likely that everyone had their own habits.</p>
<p>There were only a few miscellaneous items inside Locker No. 42, such as white gloves and masks.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan took out a pair of gloves and a mask and handed it to Zhou Wen. “Put it on. Although most Companion Eggs and Companion Beasts aren’t afraid of contamination, there are some exceptions. This is my father’s habit.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen silently took the gloves and mask and put them on. Ouyang Lan also wore one set herself before taking Zhou Wen in the elevator and going down to basement one.</p>
<p>“The three levels above are all kinds of dimensional crystals and materials. Basement one is filled with Companion Beasts and Companion Eggs, with most of them at the Legendary stage.” As Ouyang Lan spoke, the two of them reached basement one.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately saw many glass cages in the hall of basement one. There were all sorts of Companion Beasts some he had heard of and others he had never heard of.</p>
<p>“These Companion Beasts were placed here by their owners. It’s not easy to buy them. This is because their owners have to pay a huge price to transfer them so the transfer cost is much higher than buying a Companion Egg at the same level.” Ouyang Lan was very knowledgeable as she introduced all the Companion Beasts they could see, allowing Zhou Wen to broaden his horizons.</p>
<p>When they came to the Companion Egg area, the numbers clearly increased. Rows of Companion Eggs were placed behind tempered glass. The colors, sizes, and shapes were all different, making them look like dazzling gems.</p>
<p>Besides each Companion Egg was a sign. On it was some information on the Companion Egg. There were even portraits of the beast after the egg hatched.</p>
<p>“Little Wen, what do you think of this Butterfly Fairy Companion Egg… This Ice Moon Fox seems pretty good too…” Ouyang Lan seemed to be enjoying it as she kept asking for Zhou Wen’s opinion.</p>
<p>“As long as it’s from you, I believe An Jing will be happy receiving it,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That may be right, but I still wish to give her something that she will truly like. You are all young people, so your aesthetic standards are similar. Give me more opinions,” Ouyang Lan said while choosing the Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else as he thought to himself, As a man, my aesthetic sense is naturally different from women. If I were to give my opinions, the Companion Egg chosen will probably not be something An Jing will like.</p>
<p>However, since Ouyang Lan kept asking for his opinion, Zhou Wen couldn’t just keep silent. After some hesitation, he asked, “Sis Lan, can I take pictures of the Companion Eggs here?”</p>
<p>“Not for others, but it’s no problem for you. Feel free to take pictures. Later, I’ll take you downstairs. There are some Epic Companion Beasts there which you can take pictures of. If you meet them in dimensional zones in the future, you will be able to recognize them.” Ouyang Lan even pointed out some relatively important Companion Beasts and got Zhou Wen to take more pictures.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took out his mysterious phone and pretended to take photos. After taking pictures of the Companion Eggs, he immediately saw their information and data.</p>
<p>He wasn’t afraid of being recorded by the surveillance cameras because he had already tried many times using modern tools like cell phones or cameras to capture pictures of the mysterious phone’s screen to no avail. All that was snapped was a blur that prevented anything from being discerned.</p>
<p>He really couldn’t give any suggestions regarding beauty, but with the feature of the mysterious phone, he could give Ouyang Lan some suggestions of the pros and cons of the Companion Egg’s stats.</p>
<p>“No matter how I look at it, I still find the Butterfly Fairy and the Ice Moon Fox most suited for my Little Jing. Little Wen, what do you think?” Ouyang Lan finally decided on the Butterfly Fairy and Ice Moon Fox, but she was in a dilemma with which to choose from.</p>
<p>“You can buy both,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>With Ouyang Lan’s wealth, buying two Legendary Companion Eggs was just a drop in the bucket. There was no need to fret over it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had used his mysterious phone to look at the two Companion Egg. They had very average stats.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan shook her head and said, “Giving one gift reveals one’s sincerity. Giving two would only backfire. It will make Xiaojing think I’m just patronizing her.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a little envious of An Jing. He had never had a mother. His father wasn’t a person who was good at taking care of children, so no one had celebrated his birthday for him, let alone give him birthday presents.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan’s thoughtfulness towards An Jing made Zhou Wen suddenly realize that if his mother hadn’t died from a miscarriage, she would probably have loved him just like Ouyang Lan loved An Jing.</p>
<p>However, this thought only lasted for a moment. Zhou Wen was already used to living alone. He might end up feeling uncomfortable if he really had a mother like Ouyang Lan.</p>
<p>“Little Wen, what’s your take? Don’t be bothered by my choice. If it were you, which Companion Egg would you want?” Ouyang Lan asked again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pointed at a pitch-black egg that was about the size of a pigeon’s egg as he said, “If it were me, I would probably want that Venomous Caterpillar Companion Egg,”</p>
<p>“For real?” Ouyang Lan looked at Zhou Wen in astonishment.</p>
<p>Venomous Caterpillars were not powerful Companion Beasts. Although they were at the Legendary stage, their various stats were lacking. The talent skill they had—Vile Venom —was also extremely useless.</p>
<p>Such venom would only show its effects on places that the Venomous Caterpillar crawled over. However, its crawling speed was relatively slow. Even certain Mortal creatures were faster than its crawling, much less Legendary creatures.</p>
<h3 id='chapter110'>Chapter 110 Chained Companion Beast</h3>
<p>Key to everything was that Venomous Caterpillars were really ugly. Furthermore, they even emitted a foul smell when summoned. Typical girls didn’t like such Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>“Yes, very,” Zhou Wen said with a nod.</p>
<p>He had already used his mysterious phone to look at most of the Companion Eggs here. That Venomous Caterpillar’s stats were indeed one of the best Legendary Companion Eggs he had ever seen.</p>
<p>Other than having nearly full stats, it also had a rare three skills. One of them was basically the godliest skill of a Venomous Caterpillar.</p>
<p>Butterfly Transformation was a skill that could transform Venomous Caterpillar into a venomous butterfly, allowing it to gain powerful flying abilities. Its originally weak Speed then became its strongest aspect.</p>
<p>The Vile Venom skill also underwent some changes after the Venomous Caterpillar became a Venomous Butterfly. Just touching the Venomous Butterfly’s venomous powder was enough to poison someone.</p>
<p>This rare Venomous Caterpillar with three skills was considered one of the best excellent-grade Legendaries. If Zhou Wen had the money, he would probably be tempted to buy it.</p>
<p>Of course, it was just a passing thought of his. It was useless even if he bought it. Firstly, it was difficult for him to incubate a Legendary Companion Egg. Secondly, his Mutated Lotus Flower Ant and Silver-Winged Flying Ant were not weaker than Venomous Caterpillar and were perhaps a little stronger. There was no need for him to waste time and energy on it.</p>
<p>Even if he really bought it, he could only use it as food for his Companion Beasts or for fusion.</p>
<p>“Your taste is really unique…” Ouyang Lan seemed to think of something as she narrowed her eyes and mumbled to herself, “Perhaps this is a good choice. I’m just unsure if Little Jing can recognize the Companion Eggs of a Venomous Caterpillar. If not… I can tell her that this is a Black Jade Butterfly’s Companion Egg… And when she incubates it… Haha…”</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was flabbergasted, Ouyang Lan had already used her key to open the glass case and taken out the Venomous Caterpillar Companion Egg</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan called Ah Sheng over and said, “Ah Sheng, take this Companion Egg and pay for it. When the invoice is issued, get them to write it as Black Jade Butterfly. The packaging needs to be done nicely. Why don’t you do it yourself.”</p>
<p>Ah Sheng seemed to be accustomed to Ouyang Lan’s random and unconstrained ideas. He didn’t wear a look of surprise as he took the Companion Egg and left.</p>
<p>“Little Wen, let’s head down and take a look. There are quite a number of interesting Companion Beasts there. They aren’t commonly seen.” Ouyang Lan led Zhou Wen downwards.</p>
<p>After reaching basement three, they saw all kinds of independent special rooms. Each room had a Companion Beast. Although no one was guarding them, there was a powerful security system; every room needed a different key to open it.</p>
<p>Any entry to take a look at the Companion Beasts here actually required Qin Xiyuan to personally escort them. However, Ouyang Lan had his key, allowing her to directly open the room and broaden Zhou Wen’s horizons.</p>
<p>“Most of the Companion Beasts here were left behind by veterans. Companion Beasts are their partners and comrades, so they do not wish for Companion Beasts who have a limitless lifespan to die with them. Therefore, many veterans choose to transfer their Companion Beasts over here before their passing. Although there are some that do it because of financial reasons, it can’t be denied that the feelings soldiers have for their Companion Beasts far exceed those of ordinary people,” Ouyang Lan said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had always felt respect for soldiers. During the early days of the dimensional storms, countless soldiers used their lives to save ordinary people and explore dimensional zones.</p>
<p>At that time, the number of sacrificed soldiers were so many that it decreased the global military forces by a third.</p>
<p>“I wonder if that fellow is still around…” Ouyang Lan said as she walked forward and stopped in front of a door.</p>
<p>After searching the bunch of keys for a while, Ouyang Lan finally found a key and opened the heavy metal door that looked like a vault.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked into the room and was stunned when the scene before him turned clear.</p>
<p>This room also had a Companion Beast, but it was different from other Companion Beastsit had shackles on its body.</p>
<p>As the Companion Beasts were placed here by their owners, they did not need to worry too much about them hurting others. Nor was there any need to worry about them escaping.</p>
<p>The reason they were locked in rooms was that they were afraid that people would forcefully take them away or harm them. This also prevented others from pulling any tricks due to ulterior motives.</p>
<p>However, the Companion Beast in the room had shackles and cuffs on all limbs. Chains were bound around its body and behind the chains was a metal slab the size of a millstone.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan walked into the room and looked at the Companion Beast as she said, “When I was young, my father would visit him whenever he came to Uncle Qin’s place. It’s been so many years, yet he’s still here.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also sized up the Companion Beast. He looked very much like a human, but his muscles were extremely thin as though he was just skin and bones. Even his ribs could be seen clearly.</p>
<p>However, his body was dry but not withered. His skin emitted a silver metallic luster. On the skin of his upper body, there were many strange silver tattoos.</p>
<p>His long, silver hair cascaded down and covered his face and parts of his body. It was hard to see what he really looked like sitting there. It was even difficult to tell his gender.</p>
<p>“Sis Lan, what Companion Beast is this?” Zhou Wen had seen a few humanoid Companion Beasts in his textbooks, but they had traits that were different from humans. But, Zhou Wen didn’t notice anything obviously different on the Companion Beast in front of him.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I asked my father when I was young, but he didn’t answer me or tell me about the Companion Beast. However, he would come here every time he came to visit Uncle Qin.” Ouyang Lan clearly had some interest in this Companion Beast. She sighed and continued, “I later asked Uncle Qin, but he said that he has no idea what Companion Beast it is. It was put here by my father, and he hasn’t told Uncle Qin anything about it.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat curious as he sized up the Companion Beast. Suddenly, he saw a nine-key pad on the metal piece that chained it up. It looked very similar to a keypad for passcodes.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me the numbers the former principal sent me are for this? Zhou Wen had a thought.</p>
<p>However, upon further thought, he felt that something was amiss. The former principal had his daughter and granddaughter, and Qin Xiyuan was his close friend. There was no reason for him to send the passcode to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if Ouyang Lan hadn’t brought Zhou Wen here, he wouldn’t have had the chance to see the strange Companion Beast. It was useless for the former principal to send the passcode to him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter111'>Chapter 111 Entering the Lotus Flower Cave Again</h3>
<p>What perplexed Zhou Wen the most was why the former principal had sent him such a name card. Or perhaps it was not sent from the former principal at all.</p>
<p>But if it wasn’t from the former principal, who could have sent it to him?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s mind was filled with questions, but an answer eluded him. He wanted to try the number on the name card to see if it could open the Companion Beast’s chains, but he didn’t dare to do so because of the unknown consequences.</p>
<p>It would be fine if he couldn’t open it, but if he did, he couldn’t imagine what might happen.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was pondering over it, he suddenly felt a chill down his spine. Cold sweat instantly oozed out of his back as though he had been targeted by a ferocious ghost.</p>
<p>His gaze froze as he looked at the chained Companion Beast. Due to the silver hair covering the Companion Beast’s face, Zhou Wen couldn’t see his eyes or facial features. However, he had a nagging feeling that a pair of eyes were staring at him from behind the waterfall-like silver hair.</p>
<p>Unsure if it was an illusion, Zhou Wen even felt that the face behind the silver hair was smiling strangely at him.</p>
<p>“It’s almost time. Let’s get something to eat before I get Ah Sheng to take you back. We can’t affect your studying.” Ouyang Lan led Zhou Wen out of the room and locked the door.</p>
<p>Standing outside the door, Zhou Wen watched as the metal door slowly closed and slowly hid the Companion Beast’s figure. However, Zhou Wen still felt that he was staring at him and smiling</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to return to school immediately, but Ouyang Lan didn’t want to hear anything of that. She had a meal with him before getting Ah Sheng to take him back to school.</p>
<p>During the meal, Zhou Wen asked about the former principal. Ouyang Lan shared plenty of information with him, allowing him to gain a new understanding of the constantly smiling former principal.</p>
<p>In the past, Zhou Wen felt that the former principal was kind and had taken good care of him, but he didn’t care much about the administrative matters. Back when he was the principal of Guide High School, he didn’t really deal with matters. Everything was left to the vice-principals while he spent his days planting flowers and taking care of his grass. He looked especially relaxed.</p>
<p>However, from Ouyang Lan’s recount, Zhou Wen learned that the former principal was a very famous historian and had experienced the era of the dimensional storms.</p>
<p>The An family’s previous generation and the old principal were sworn brothers and even closed their ties through marriage. However, life was harsh on Ouyang Lan’s ex-husband and he died too early.</p>
<p>Although he learned quite a bit about the former principal, this wasn’t of much help to him. The only information that helped him was when Ouyang Lan said that the former principal had indeed been invited to a dimensional zone in Zhuolu County.</p>
<p>As the magnetic interference was too overwhelming, it rendered electronic communications almost useless. It had been a long time since Ouyang Lan had received news from the former principal.</p>
<p>Although such things happened often in the past, Ouyang Lan was worried as there was nothing she could do.</p>
<p>After returning to his dorm, Zhou Wen saw the antelope still sleeping on the couch. This left him disappointed.</p>
<p>Lying in the bed, he took out his phone and continued grinding the dungeons. Like before, he first wiped out the various mini-bosses before committing suicide at Fire God Platform.</p>
<p>When he arrived at Tiger Cage Pass, Zhou Wen saw a word-engraved Demonized General appear. Delighted, he closed the distance and realized it was a Paper Demonized General.</p>
<p>Although the word-engraved Demonized General was powerful, Zhou Wen had the Astral Slash Blade that restrained it. Soon, he killed the Paper Demonized General and heard a chime—a dimensional crystal dropped.</p>
<p>Primordial Energy Skill Crystal! Zhou Wen was delighted when he saw the crystal’s name.</p>
<p>He impatiently picked up the Primordial Energy Skill Crystal and the blood-colored avatar successfully absorbed it.</p>
<p>‘Absorbed Paper Demonized General Crystal. Attained Astral Suction Palm.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had longed for the Paper Demonized General’s Primordial Energy Skill and now with his wish answered, he couldn’t help but use it immediately.</p>
<p>He reached out and sucked at a Demonized Soldier at Tiger Cage Pass. The Demonized Soldier’s body was instantly sucked towards the blood-colored avatar’s palm, unable to escape no matter how hard it struggled.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar waved its other palm and slashed down at the Demonized Soldier’s head with Astral Slash Blade.</p>
<p>It’s truly a godly skill! The importance Zhou Wen placed on the Astral Suction Palm was higher than the Astral Slash Blade.</p>
<p>Although Astral Slash Blade was powerful, it was only an offensive measure. Even without it, Zhou Wen still had other offensive means. However, this was the only Primordial Energy Skill he had that could force an enemy to change trajectories.</p>
<p>After studying it for a while, Zhou Wen gained a general understanding of the Astral Suction Palm. It was just like Astral Slash Blade, a Primordial Energy Skill that didn’t have fixed Primordial Energy costs.</p>
<p>The further the enemy was or the greater the weight, the more Primordial Energy that Astral Suction Palm expended.</p>
<p>With the amount of Primordial Energy Zhou Wen had at present, he could easily absorb creatures like Demonized Soldiers from about two meters away. In turn, Legendary creatures like a Demonized General would be more difficult.</p>
<p>However, being unable to draw an enemy didn’t mean it was useless. The suction force would still affect the Demonized General, causing its actions to deviate from its intentions.</p>
<p>A clash between experts lasted for an instant, so any deviation was fatal.</p>
<p>The more Zhou Wen studied Astral Suction Palm, the more satisfied he was with it. In the future, after he advanced to the Legendary stage, his Primordial Energy upper limits would increase; thus, raising the might of his Astral Suction Palm. It would be an ever-green Primordial Energy Skill.</p>
<p>Among the three word-engraved Demonized Generals, only the Fist Demonized General hasn’t been killed. I wonder if the Astral Suction Palm palm can withstand the Fist Demonized General’s skills. Zhou Wen couldn’t be sure.</p>
<p>Now that Zhou Wen had the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant, he was still unable to defeat the Fist Demonized General.</p>
<p>It was not that the Fist Demonized General was much more powerful than Paper and Blade Demonized Generals, but that its main skill was just too ridiculous. When used, it seemed to gain an invincible body that the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant and Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s Primordial Energy Skills were unable to injure or kill.</p>
<p>Now, all Zhou Wen could do was place his hopes on Astral Suction Palm. Since Astral Slash Blade countered Astral Suction Palm, it was possible that Astral Suction Palm countered the Fist Demonized General’s skill.</p>
<p>However, encountering a Fist Demonized General solely depended on luck. Zhou Wen constantly grinded the dungeon before heading to the Fire God Platform to read the Ancient Imperial Sutra. This continued as the days passed.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, I’m ready. Come to Lotus Flower Cave with me again.” Wang Lu, who he hadn’t seen in days, shouted for Zhou Wen from the neighboring yard. Today was the deadline for her homework mission.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been paid, so he naturally had no reason to reject her. He had to accompany her to the Lotus Flower Cave.</p>
<p>“This is my last chance. Today, I will definitely break Huang Ji’s record.” Wang Lu was filled with confidence.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen declined to comment. All he did was film Wang Lu from behind with a camera. After they entered the Lotus Flower Cave, they searched for Fairy Monkeys in the stone cave.</p>
<p>After exploring several spots in the stone caves, they finally discovered a Fairy Monkey. However, before Wang Lu could make a move, the Fairy Monkey was killed by someone else.</p>
<h3 id='chapter112'>Chapter 112 Swift Saber Heavenly King</h3>
<p>It was a boy of Zhou Wen’s age. He held a purple narrow saber in his hand, and his body flashed like a ghost. With a few clashes with the Fairy Monkey, he slew it.</p>
<p>The entire process took less than twenty seconds, and the speed at which it happened was terrifying</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sized up the boy in astonishment. He found it amazing that the boy’s Speed was faster than a Fairy Monkey’s. It was extremely rare among students.</p>
<p>His saber skills were even faster than his physical movement techniques. Fairy Monkey’s Speed and movement techniques were top in class amongst Legendary creatures, but for it to fail to dodge a single saber strike implied how terrifyingly fast this saber was.</p>
<p>The boy wiped the blood from the saber and looked at Zhou Wen and Wang Lu. Soon, his gaze landed on Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Are you Zhou Wen, the one who killed the word-engraved Demonized General?” the boy stared at Zhou Wen and asked.</p>
<p>“I’m Zhou Wen. Who are you?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“What a pity,” the boy said without rhyme or reason before leaving with the saber.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a little baffled, but he couldn’t be bothered to think too much. With the camera, he prepared to continue forward.</p>
<p>Wang Lu, however, looked in the direction of the boy’s departure and said, “I didn’t expect Feng Qiuyan to actually come to Sunset College. Why didn’t I see him among the special admissions students?”</p>
<p>e rec</p>
<p>“Do you still want to break the record?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>The boy from before had clearly broken Huang Ji’s previous record. Furthermore, the time he took significantly broke the record at below twenty seconds. Wang Lu might be strong, but to slay a Fairy Monkey within twenty seconds was clearly impossible.</p>
<p>“What record? With that fellow around, no one can be faster than him.” Wang Lu paused and explained, “That fellow is called Feng Qiuyan. You might not have heard of his name in a place like Luoyang, but where I come from, his fame is at the level of Luoyang’s An Jing. They are all considered invincible, cream of the crop. Rumor has it that his Legendary Life Providence is Swift Saber Heavenly King. At the same stage, no one can be faster than his saber. You saw it too. Even the Fairy Monkey couldn’t dodge his strike, it’s obvious how fast his saber is. It’s completely impossible to compete in speed records,” Wang Lu said with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>“Swift Saber Heavenly King? Is this a Life Providence that augments his swift saber?” Zhou Wen asked out of curiosity.</p>
<p>“Probably. A Life Providence is a secret for everyone, so people wouldn’t usually tell others. I only know that his Life Providence is known as the Swift Saber Heavenly King that significantly augments anything to do with sabers.” After a pause, Wang Lu continued, “Do you know there’s an organization that especially rates Life Providence? The Feng family has a senior that works at that organization. When evaluation of Feng Qiuyan’s Swift Saber Heavenly King Life Providence was made, the rumored result was an S-grade talent.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it said that the ratings of that organization aren’t accurate?” Zhou Wen had also heard of the organization. However, it was only a grassroots organization and wasn’t created by the League’s officials. Therefore, its ratings were greatly limited.</p>
<p>“Indeed, it can’t be confirmed as the Life Providence they evaluate is firstly based on how much it boosts one’s combat ability. As a result, the combat-based Life Providence ratings are usually higher, but in fact, many Life Providence might not boost one’s combat strength too significantly while still remaining very useful. However, to be rated as an S-grade means the Swift Saber Heavenly King Life Providence is undeniably powerful.” Wang Lu didn’t deliberately belittle that organization.</p>
<p>I wonder what my Life Providence will be in the future? Typically, a Life Providence is related to a person’s physique and the Primordial Energy Art one cultivates. My physique isn’t bad and the Primordial Energy Art I cultivate in isn’t weak. I don’t think it will be difficult to obtain a powerful Life Providence. I just have no idea what kind it will be. It’s best if it’s a combat-style Life Providence. Zhou Wen felt some anticipation for his Life Providence.</p>
<p>However, advancement with the Lost Immortal Sutra was much more difficult than the average Primordial Energy Art. Even the Primordial Energy Arts on the mysterious stone monuments weren’t as difficult to cultivate as the Lost Immortal Sutra.</p>
<p>“With Feng Qiuyan around, there’s no hope of breaking the record. I can only blame myself for my bad luck.” Wang Lu was slightly depressed</p>
<p>Although she didn’t really care about this record, to be doused with cold water after preparing for so long and being at the brink of success would leave anyone depressed.</p>
<p>“It’s not difficult to break his record,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“You have a solution?” Wang Lu’s eyes lit up as she looked at Zhou Wen. She surprisingly didn’t have any doubts over his words.</p>
<p>“There is a solution, but it’s not part of my job,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Speak. What conditions do you have?” Wang Lu saw through Zhou Wen’s thoughts and curled her lips.</p>
<p>“Money, how much can you pay me if I help you break the record?” Zhou Wen wasn’t materialistic and didn’t spend much money. However, to invest in Huang Ji’s game required a huge sum of money.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have the time or means to earn money. All he could do was start with trivial matters and save up whatever he earned.</p>
<p>A rich person like Wang Lu, who could pay 150,000 bucks for a videographer, likely valued help to break a record at 150,000 bucks or more.</p>
<p>Wang Lu sized up Zhou Wen and asked, “Are you that short of money?”</p>
<p>“Yes, very.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>“What do you plan on doing with the money? How much do you need?” Wang Lu asked</p>
<p>again.</p>
<p>“I have no idea how much money I need. A senior from our school is making a mobile game. I wish to invest in him, but I don’t know how much I need to invest. However, I believe plenty is needed.” Zhou Wen didn’t hide the fact that it was an investment in a game. He was planning to invest in Huang Ji’s game to make others know of it. The more people who knew it, the better.</p>
<p>“You’re really a gaming fanatic. In this era, there aren’t many people who are addicted to games like you anymore.” Wang Lu thought for a while before saying, “But the scale of making a game has quite a range, so the amount of money spent will be highly variable. If you only wish to make a simple game, a hundred to two hundred thousand bucks would be enough. I can give you that immediately, but if the game you wish to make is grander in scale, the money I give you will be a drop in the bucket. You might as well write up a proposal. If I think it’s feasible, I can invest in both of you.”</p>
<p>“We’ll talk about investment in the future. It’s best you give me the money for helping you break the record,” Zhou Wen said as he extended his hand.</p>
<p>Wang Lu fiercely swatted away Zhou Wen’s hand. “You can have the money, but first you have to break the record for me. How do I know if you can really help me break the record or not?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say another word. He began searching for a Fairy Monkey in Lotus Flower Cave with Wang Lu. Breaking a record needed them to first find a Fairy Monkey.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was rather confident about breaking Feng Qiuyan’s record. He had been grinding Fairy Monkeys recently and had quite some experience killing them. It could be said that Zhou Wen was the person who understood Fairy Monkeys the most in Sunset College.</p>
<h3 id='chapter113'>Chapter 113 Performance</h3>
<p>Wang Lu was actually quite doubtful about Zhou Wen’s ability to help her break the record. Although he had a pair of Legendary wings and powerful movement techniques, that level of movement and speed was definitely capable of dodging Feng Qiuyan’s saber.</p>
<p>The saber speed which Swift Saber Heavenly King Life Providence brought about made Feng Qiuyan’s strikes far exceed the speed of peers at his level. Furthermore, Zhou Wen hadn’t advanced to the Legendary stage-he was one level lower than Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>Compared to someone who had the Life Providence of Swift Saber Heavenly King, even Wang Lu did not have the confidence to beat him in speed.</p>
<p>“How are you going to help me? Although the homework mission permits a four-person team to complete it, I do not plan on joining forces with others. If that’s the case, defeating Feng Qiuyan would be meaningless,” Wang Lu said to Zhou Wen as they walked.</p>
<p>“When you encounter a Fairy Monkey later, I’ll first demonstrate it to you. All you need to do is remember my steps. With your strength, you will be able to kill Fairy Monkeys in less than twenty seconds.” Having been in charge of filming Wang Lu’s combat, he had a good idea of her strength. It was also why he dared to help Wang Lu break the record.</p>
<p>“You’ll be demonstrating?” Wang Lu sized up Zhou Wen and asked.</p>
<p>“We have no choice. You only have one chance left, and I’m afraid you won’t be able to grasp the crux by just verbally explaining it to you,” Zhou Wen said honestly.</p>
<p>His method of slaying Fairy Monkeys was from the experience he had gained from killing countless whilst in-game. Every step had been calculated to extreme precision. He could not afford any mistakes if he wanted to kill one in the shortest time possible.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen were to do it himself, it wouldn’t be a problem even if he made a mistake. However, Wang Lu didn’t have that much experience fighting Fairy Monkeys. She only had the theory from the college’s information and videos.</p>
<p>In fact, the information provided by the school wasn’t as logical or pragmatic as Zhou Wen’s designed plans. After all, there were too few Fairy Monkeys and no one had the chance of killing many, so it was naturally impossible for them to have a deep understanding of them.</p>
<p>After traveling through several caves, they finally found a Fairy Monkey. Just as Zhou Wen was about to charge forward, Wang Lu suddenly thought of something. She hurriedly said, “By the way, after the Lotus Flower Cave is sealed by the college, students are not to hunt Fairy Monkeys without permission. Our class was given the homework mission, and we can only kill two. You aren’t a student of our class, so you didn’t receive the homework mission that allows you to kill a Fairy Monkey.”</p>
<p>“I know, so I have no plans to kill it.” Zhou Wen didn’t stop as he charged at the Fairy Monkey.</p>
<p>This time, Wang Lu became the videographer. She aimed the camera at Zhou Wen, curious to see how he could kill the Fairy Monkey faster than the Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>Wang Lu was still a little apprehensive. Zhou Wen had Primordial Energy Skills that she definitely knew couldn’t be identical to hers. If he used some special skill which she lacked, then even if Zhou Wen’s method was much faster than Feng Qiuyan’s, she would be unable to use his method.</p>
<p>However, Wang Lu quickly realized that her worries were completely unfounded. This was because Zhou Wen hadn’t used any Primordial Energy Skill or Companion Beast. All he did was rush towards the Fairy Monkey.</p>
<p>If it were anyone else, Wang Lu would have believed that he had a death wish, but she knew Zhou Wen’s strength and character quite well. It was impossible for him to do something so foolish.</p>
<p>She adjusted the camera to ensure that she could record Zhou Wen’s every move, while her gaze never left him.</p>
<p>The Fairy Monkey bared its teeth as it charged down. Its pair of wings made it abnormally agile, swooping down like a bird of prey while its claws swiped at Zhou Wen’s head with a sharp beam.</p>
<p>The Fairy Monkey was much faster than Zhou Wen, but he seemed to have expected it. He slightly tilted his body to dodge the claw beam as he clung close to the Fairy Monkey’s left.</p>
<p>The Fairy Monkey’s wings flapped as his body warped. Its claws once again thrust out at Zhou Wen’s heart with a sharp claw beam.</p>
<p>This time, the Fairy Monkey was closer to Zhou Wen, and its claw beam was even faster and sharper. However, Zhou Wen’s body moved slightly to the side again, dodging the attack in what seemed like an impossibility.</p>
<p>Wang Lu stood to the side and watched. Zhou Wen didn’t use any Primordial Energy Skills, not even anything related to movement techniques. With his absolute Speed deficiency, he leisurely managed to dodge all the Fairy Monkey’s mighty attacks.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gave Wang Lu an odd feeling. It was as though he was the stronger party-not the Fairy Monkey who was at the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s every move was calm and composed, but he had the feeling of clairvoyance, emitting a pressure as though the Fairy Monkey was dancing in his palm.</p>
<p>It may have felt slow, but in fact, it all happened very quickly. In just ten seconds. Zhou Wen had nimbly moved to the Fairy Monkey’s back and easily struck the back of its skull.</p>
<p>Pa!</p>
<p>It looked like it didn’t use much strength, but the Fairy Monkey appeared to be struck by lightning as it fell from the sky. It fell to the ground and twitched, unable to get up immediately.</p>
<p>Wang Lu’s eyes widened when she saw this. A Mortal-stage fellow had only relied on his Strength and Speed. Without the help of his Primordial Energy Skills and Companion Beasts, he had knocked out a Legendary-stage Fairy Monkey.</p>
<p>More importantly, slightly more than 10 seconds had passed, without even exceeding 11. Wang Lu was afraid that none of her classmates would believe her if she told them.</p>
<p>“How did you do it?” Wang Lu asked as she glared at Zhou Wen who was walking back.</p>
<p>“You can do the same if you observe and study more.” Zhou Wen pointed at the Fairy Monkey on the ground who still couldn’t get to its feet due to its stupor. “It’s a little groggy from the strike. It will quickly regain consciousness, so let’s leave now. Find a spot and watch my demonstration video a few times. Remember my positioning and the timing of my attacks. It probably wouldn’t be difficult to squeeze it within 20 seconds. Also, the spot I struck should be precisely where you hit during your final strike. It will result in a death blow; otherwise, it will be a waste of time.”</p>
<p>Wang Lu and Zhou Wen came to an empty stone cave before the former carefully watched Zhou Wen’s video.</p>
<p>“How did you figure out such positioning and the Fairy Monkey’s weakness?” Wang Lu found it inconceivable the more she looked at it. Even the college’s strategies were not as simple and effective as Zhou Wen’s.</p>
<p>“I carefully watched the videos I recorded for you the other day. I studied them for a long time before I could achieve such results. Selling it to you for 150,000 isn’t expensive, right?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Not at all.” Wang Lu nodded with affirmation.</p>
<p>Such experience could not be measured with money. If they were in a real battlefield, it could save one’s life.</p>
<p>Wang Lu practiced Zhou Wen’s positioning for more than half an hour before mastering the crux. Her talent in martial arts wasn’t to be underestimated, allowing her to live up to being a special admissions student.</p>
<p>Then, Wang Lu found the Fairy Monkey again and killed it according to Zhou Wen’s method. The process was rather relaxing. Although the positioning was a little rough, she obtained good results in 17 seconds. It was probably a little faster than Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>Although the record had been broken, Wang Lu wasn’t happy. Others might not know, but she knew very well that Zhou Wen had a more ridiculous result. It was just that his results would not appear in the school’s record.</p>
<h3 id='chapter114'>Chapter 114 Gym Training</h3>
<p>Inside an office, Qiao Siyuan stood respectfully in front of his desk with his head lowered, wearing a humble look.</p>
<p>“Have you found the thing I asked you to find?” A man sat behind his desk. As the only light in the office was the table lamp, the man’s face couldn’t be seen clearly. Only a blurry silhouette could be seen.</p>
<p>“Sir, apart from the An family, I’ve searched everywhere I can. I didn’t find the thing you were talking about.” Qiao Siyuan lowered his head and replied cautiously.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you go to the An family?” the man asked indifferently.</p>
<p>“We had sent people to infiltrate them, but Ouyang Lan keeps the An family tightly under wraps. The people we sent didn’t have the chance of getting close to where Ouyang Lan and the rest live. They were only able to do miscellaneous chores in the yard.” After a pause, Qiao Siyuan continued, “In the name of pursuing Jing Daoxian, I had tried using Liz to test the An family’s attitude. An Tianzuo was very unyielding, and he didn’t care about the Senator by maiming Liz’s energy sea. It’s not simple to enter the An family to search for it.”</p>
<p>“If everything is that easily solved, what do I need you for?” the man coldly asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. You’re right. I will think of another solution.” Qiao Siyuan bowed slightly before continuing, “Sir, I don’t think Professor Ouyang left the thing at the An family home.”</p>
<p>“Why do you say that?” The man sitting behind the light lit up a cigarette with an old lighter.</p>
<p>“According to my investigations, Professor Ouyang may be close friends with the An family, but he did not agree to Ouyang Lan’s marriage into the An family. Because of this matter, they had a falling out. Since then, he hasn’t entered the An family home and wasn’t even present when An Tianzuo and An Jing were born.”</p>
<p>Seeing no response from the man, Qiao Siyuan continued, “It’s also because after that person’s death in the An family that Professor Ouyang and Ouyang Lan’s relationship improved. However, he’s only visited the An family a few times and never stays there for more than an hour, much less stay overnight. With Professor Ouyang’s relationship with the An family, I don’t think he will leave something so important there.”</p>
<p>“Then, where would Ouyang hide the thing?” the man flicked away some cigarette ash before asking</p>
<p>“Sir, do you think Professor Ouyang could have taken it with him?” Qiao Siyuan probed.</p>
<p>“Impossible. That thing can’t enter dimensional zones or it will only spell trouble. Ouyang often needs to enter dimensional zones, so he won’t be so stupid. He must have hidden it somewhere.” The man paused before saying, “Regardless, you must find the thing at all costs. Do not dismiss the An family’s residence. Who knows if their poor relationship was just an act Ouyang deliberately created.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.” Qiao Siyuan bowed.</p>
<p>“We don’t have much time left. We need to retrieve it as soon as possible. Those ignorant fools outside think that time can be squandered, but they have no idea that the disaster is already hanging above their necks like a guillotine blade. It can fall at any time. Once the dimensional zones’ restrictions are gone, humanity will usher in the apocalypse. Therefore, we need to have that item in our hands to prevent that from happening,” the man said.</p>
<p>“Sir, is that thing really that important?” Qiao Siyuan asked the question on his mind.</p>
<p>“Back when humanity entered the Holy Land, there weren’t just six heroes. In fact, there were a lot more, but most of them ended up dying inside, their names unknown to people. Besides the six heroes, some also left the Holy Land alive and brought certain things out. Jing Daoxian was one of them. Likewise for Ouyang. The thing he has was something I saw him take out the Holy Land with my own eyes. It is of grave importance. We need to gain control of it,” the man said.</p>
<p>“Sir, I think there’s a coincidence over a matter, but I’m not sure if it’s problem,” Qiao Siyuan said after some thought.</p>
<p>“Speak.”</p>
<p>“Back when Jing Daoxian was seriously injured and under our pursuit, he actually stayed in Guide City for nearly ten minutes,” Qiao Siyuan said.</p>
<p>“You’ve already written this in the report. It’s related to that youth named Zhou Wen, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Later on, I investigated Zhou Wen in detail. Other than being Zhou Lingfeng’s son, he has a rather good relationship with Professor Ouyang. When Professor Ouyang was principal at Guide City, he often invited Zhou Wen to eat at his placea treatment that other students and even teachers didn’t receive. Now, Ouyang Lan has married Zhou Lingfeng. I just find it too much of a coincidence. I’m thinking of the possibility that Professor Ouyang gave the item to Zhou Wen or Zhou Lingfeng.”</p>
<p>“Impossible. The power of that thing isn’t something a Mortal-stage can withstand. It’s impossible to even hold it. You can continue investigating Zhou Wen, but you have to place your focus on the An family. The only ones with the capability to commandeer that item in the An family are An Tianzuo and Ouyang Lan.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I understand.”</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan wasn’t in a good mood. He originally thought that he would definitely be first in class for the homework mission, but he never expected Wang Lu to be faster than him by nearly a second.</p>
<p>As expected of Wang Lu. She already has such power even before advancing to the Legendary stage. After Feng Qiuyan saw Wang Lu’s video for the homework mission, he realized that he had lost fair and square. Wang Lu’s comprehension and control over her positioning had reached an extremely high level. This was something that he lacked.</p>
<p>After Wang Lu advances to the Legendary stage, I will definitely fight her. Before that, I still need to train myself and make myself stronger. Feng Qiuyan quickly walked to the school gym.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan believed that he had to be focused on everything he did. Quality was demanded for everything, so he only practiced his saber techniques. He hoped to make his saber techniques faster and stronger, allowing him to reach the peak of the world.</p>
<p>Hence, after arriving at the gym, Feng Qiuyan immediately walked towards the training court where the ball launcher was. It was the most suitable machine for him to practice his saber’s</p>
<p>speed.</p>
<p>However, when Feng Qiuyan got to the ball launcher court, he frowned when he realized that someone was occupying the grounds in practice.</p>
<p>On careful look, he realized that the person was someone he knew—the freshman who had killed the word-engraved Demonized General, Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>There was only one ball launcher, so Feng Qiuyan didn’t wish to waste any time waiting. Therefore, after some thought, he walked straight into the court and picked up a rubber training saber from the rack before walking towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter115'>Chapter 115 Unable to Touch the Balls</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that having his strength constantly increase despite staying in his dorm gaming all day seemed a little too eyebrow-raising, so he planned on some outdoor activities. At least, he had to let others know that he was cultivating arduously.</p>
<p>After circling the gym once, he had planned on choosing a simple strength training machine to train his legs, allowing him to free his hands and continue gaming.</p>
<p>But to his surprise, the gym was filled with people. After searching for a while, he discovered an empty training court.</p>
<p>In the past, Zhou Wen had never used a ball launcher. After seeing the demonstration on the screen, he knew what kind of machine it</p>
<p>was.</p>
<p>The ball launcher was similar to the pitching machines used in baseball practice. Balls were shot out of the machine and the trainee aimed to hit them.</p>
<p>It was just that the launcher would be shot in random directions in a wide area. Furthermore, it could also shoot multiple balls simultaneously. This was slightly different from a baseball pitching machine</p>
<p>There were many practice weapons on the racks-sabers, swords, poles, spears, whips, etc. They were all made of rubber.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen casually picked up a short pole and turned on the ball launcher. He was too lazy to study how he could adjust the launcher’s difficulty, so he simply switched it on.</p>
<p>A ball shot out from the launcher’s barrel like a cannonball. Zhou Wen took note of the distance and swung his short stick, easily striking the ball and sending it far away.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen realized that the launcher was rather simple. He could use one hand to strike the balls while using the other for gaming.</p>
<p>Some training like this doesn’t seem too bad. As Zhou Wen gamed, he didn’t need to look at the balls with his eyes to strike them. The listening ability that Truth Listener imbued him allowed him to hit the balls accurately.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen discovered that practicing Truth Listener’s hearing ability was very helpful to his hearing.</p>
<p>There were all kinds of dimensional zones, many that had a great effect on one’s vision, causing people to sometimes fight blind. All Zhou Wen originally wanted to do was to get some exercise, but after practicing for a while, he found such training very beneficial.</p>
<p>At that moment, Feng Qiuyan arrived at the training ground.</p>
<p>He walked onto the court with a practice saber in hand, but when he saw Zhou Wen gaming while striking the balls, he couldn’t help but frown.</p>
<p>Looking at the balls’ trajectory and speed, he knew that this was the lowest level of difficulty. It wasn’t even a challenge for ordinary high-schoolers who had cultivated, much less students of Sunset College.</p>
<p>From Feng Qiuyan’s point of view, Zhou Wen’s training was an insult to the word “training.”</p>
<p>Therefore, Feng Qiuyan decided to kick Zhou Wen out. Rather than let Zhou Wen waste the school’s resources, it was better for him to train more.</p>
<p>Of course, it was beneath Feng Qiuyan to chase someone away, nor did he want to nag at Zhou Wen like a woman.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan had his own ways of doing things —in a masculine manner.</p>
<p>He approached Zhou Wen with a practice saber in hand and Feng Qiuyan stood there silently without moving as he stared at the ball launcher’s muzzle.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan’s idea was very simple. It was like playing basketball. As long as he snatched away all rebounds, preventing Zhou Wen from touching the balls, Zhou Wen would naturally find it pointless and leave.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan was confident he could snatch all of Zhou Wen’s balls, preventing him from even touching a single ball.</p>
<p>Pong!</p>
<p>With a compressive blast emitted from the launch, a ball was shot out as it flew towards Zhou Wen at high speeds.</p>
<p>“Right now.” Feng Qiuyan’s heart stirred and was about to swing the wooden saber in his hand.</p>
<p>He was confident that as long as he brandished his saber, there would be nothing left for Zhou Wen. The speed at which he drew his saber was not something any ordinary student could match. Even if Zhou Wen stood in front of him, Feng Qiuyan was confident he could gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>However, when Feng Qiuyan raised the practice saber in his hand and was about to brandish it, his hand paused in midair. He had ultimately failed to complete the slash as he watched Zhou Wen send the ball flying with his practice pole.</p>
<p>Is it a coincidence? Feng Qiuyan frowned as he looked at Zhou Wen. He had his back to him, one hand still holding a pole, the other hand gaming on his phone.</p>
<p>However, just as Feng Qiuyan was about to attack, he felt that Zhou Wen was standing in the most appropriate position, blocking all the trajectories of his saber slashes. It prevented him from slashing at the ball.</p>
<p>It was like a rebound in basketball. Zhou Wen stood in the spot where the basketball landed. Although the others could jump higher than him, it was difficult to snatch the ball if they weren’t in the right place.</p>
<p>The position Zhou Wen stood in had given Feng Qiuyan such a feeling, preventing him from having any chance of striking.</p>
<p>It’s probably just a coincidence, Feng Qiuyan thought to himself as he stared at the ball launcher’s muzzle.</p>
<p>There were a total of thirty-six launching muzzles. They were split into six rows, covering a length and height of twenty meters. Each muzzle had a small range of movement and direction, allowing for different trajectories in the balls it shot out.</p>
<p>As it was set to the lowest difficulty level, it only shot out one ball at a time. However, where the ball shot out from and its direction was unpredictable.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan focused and planned on finding the ball’s landing spot before Zhou Wen could. He wanted him to have a taste of what it felt like to not be able to hit the ball.</p>
<p>Pong!</p>
<p>Another ball shot out. Feng Qiuyan trained his gaze at the ball’s direction and position. Just as he raised his foot to rush over, he saw Zhou Wen already walk over. He was already one step too slow if he took the step now. Even if he rushed over, he would lose the optimal spot, failing to snatch the ball from Zhou Wen like before.</p>
<p>If you want to play, fine! I’ll be serious this time. Feng Qiuyan imagined Zhou Wen was competing with him.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen’s attitude of gaming while striking the ball made it obvious to him that he thought nothing of him. This made Feng Qiuyan vexed.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t thinking too much about it. He did hear someone beside him, but he didn’t know that the person was Feng Qiuyan, nor did he know that Feng Qiuyan wanted to chase him away. He originally imagined that the training court allowed multiple people in, so he thought nothing of it. He just struck the balls relying on his hearing and senses.</p>
<p>The inclusion of Feng Qiuyan was also a form of practice for him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still grinding Ant Nest-a dungeon he usually grinded when in public with other people around.</p>
<p>Another ball shot out. Feng Qiuyan was already fully focused, but just as he took his step, he realized that Zhou Wen was one step ahead of him, happening to walk to the optimal location before him again.</p>
<p>Pong!</p>
<p>The ball was sent flying by Zhou Wen again. Feng Qiuyan had failed to touch three consecutive balls. He didn’t even strike out at all.</p>
<h3 id='chapter116'>Chapter 116 How Did You Do It?</h3>
<p>At first, Feng Qiuyan had deliberately suppressed his Speed, trying his best to maintain it at the Mortal stage to compete with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, with the passage of time, Feng Qiuyan subconsciously increased his Speed after repeatedly failing to beat Zhou Wen to the punch. He began competing with Zhou Wen with Speed at the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>This only served to alarm Feng Qiuyan even more-Speed at the Legendary stage was still inadequate. Although his Speed was really much faster than Zhou Wen’s, with Zhou Wen standing in the middle of the court which was about twenty meters wide, he only needed to cover ten meters.</p>
<p>Due to the short distance, he wasn’t able to manifest his Speed advantage.</p>
<p>That was not the main reason either. Although the advantage of a short distance wasn’t too obvious, an advantage was still an advantage. Under normal circumstances, he would definitely grab an advantageous spot ahead of time.</p>
<p>Even if he couldn’t take that spot, with his saber speed, he could still strike the ball before Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, it was like Zhou Wen was prescient. Before the launcher shot out the ball, he had already begun moving. It was too late for Feng Qiuyan to move by the time he saw the ball. Having faster Speed was useless and this left Feng Qiuyan extremely aggrieved.</p>
<p>What was even more unacceptable to Feng Qiuyan was that Zhou Wen had been gaming with his other hand the entire time while snatching the ball away from him.</p>
<p>At first, Feng Qiuyan thought that Zhou Wen was deliberately insulting him and wasn’t really focused on his gaming.</p>
<p>However, Feng Qiuyan later discovered that Zhou Wen was truly gaming. His eyes were peeled to the screen, having never left it once. It was as though snatching the ball was something that he did in passing.</p>
<p>This fellow… He’s formidable… Sweat began oozing out of Feng Qiuyan’s forehead as he stared at Zhou Wen’s back. The contempt he had for him previously vanished completely. Zhou Wen’s figure seemed to grow in size, turning tall and mighty. It was like an uninvadable city wall.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t paying attention to him at all, lost to his new discovery.</p>
<p>The Truth Listener earring gave him tremendous hearing, enough to make him hear the ball launcher in operation clearly. Therefore, he knew which muzzle the ball would shoot out ahead of time, allowing him to know the ball’s trajectory and landing spot before Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>However, this wasn’t the biggest surprise for Zhou Wen. What truly surprised him was his train of thought.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was an extremely focused person. In the past, no matter what he did, he could be fully focused without being disturbed by anything. Therefore, others might find him dull due to his lack of reaction no matter what they said to him.</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn’t because Zhou Wen was dull and silly, but that he was too focused to the point of not being able to hear what others were saying to him.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen realized that he could still be focused on what he was doing, but at the same time, he seemed to be able to handle other matters as well. This feeling was rather indescribable.</p>
<p>If an analogy had to be made, Zhou Wen’s thought process could be analogous to a computer processor. In the past, Zhou Wen’s brain was a single-core processor, but now, it was a dual-core, allowing it to handle multiple programs at the same time.</p>
<p>Of course, this was only an analogy and was limited in its accuracy. However, it was a fact that Zhou Wen could hit all the balls while gaming. There didn’t seem to be any interference between the two activities.</p>
<p>At the same time, Zhou Wen keenly discovered that while he was gaming and striking the balls, the Lost Immortal Sutra’s circulation became especially fast. It was more than twice as fast as usual.</p>
<p>It appears this is the result of the Lost Immortal Sutra. Zhou Wen increasingly found the Lost Immortal Sutra extraordinary. However, he couldn’t figure out why Jing Daoxian had given him such a powerful Primordial Energy Art for no reason. It didn’t seem to make sense if it was simply because he caught his fancy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know the origins of the Lost Immortal Sutra, so he naturally didn’t know how terrifying it was. If not for the extraordinary focus he was born with, he would have long been killed by it. Even if he didn’t die, he would go mad.</p>
<p>Even now, Zhou Wen could hear the murmuring voices resounding in his ears when sleeping at night. It would be difficult for a normal person to endure such harassment. Even if he didn’t go mad, he would become extremely irascible; yet, Zhou Wen didn’t suffer from such effects.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen indulged in the thrill of his new discovery and training, Feng Qiuyan’s expression became increasingly ugly.</p>
<p>He had already done his best, but couldn’t snatch the ball from Zhou Wen. Although summoning a Companion Beast would give him a chance of defeating Zhou Wen, Feng Qiuyan’s pride prevented him from doing so. He continued relying only on his physical prowess to compete with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen felt that he had enough practice today, he stopped and rested. Just as he was about to return, he turned his head to look at Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>He couldn’t help but be taken aback by what he saw.</p>
<p>He recognized Feng Qiuyan, but he looked drastically different from before. He was covered in sweat as he panted heavily. His eyes were glaring at him with eyes as red as a rabbit’s eyes. This look like he could devour him at any moment gave Zhou Wen a fright.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan wasn’t truly exhausted but was suffering from immense mental stress. With his physique at the Legendary stage, he had lost to a Mortal-stage fellow. Furthermore, he had been badly defeated. He had failed to snatch a single ball despite Zhou Wen gaming with one hand. The stress was simply unimaginable.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for Feng Qiuyan’s determination, anyone else with a slightly weaker well would probably have already lost their confidence.</p>
<p>The more Feng Qiuyan wanted to win, the greater the stress he was under. The mental fatigue he suffered exceeded his physical fatigue.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen imagined that Feng Qiuyan would lunge at him and bite him, Feng Qiuyan glared at him and suddenly asked, “How did you do it?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean how?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>“How are you able to predict the landing spot of the ball without looking for it?” Feng Qiuyan asked the question burning in his heart.</p>
<p>He was stronger than Zhou Wen in everything, but he had lost to him on this point.</p>
<p>“Because of this.” Zhou Wen pointed at his ear before picking up the coat on the chair and left.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was referring to the Truth Listener earring he was wearing, but Feng Qiuyan clearly misunderstood Zhou Wen’s words. He believed that Zhou Wen was referring to his ear and instantly, he fell into thought as he muttered to himself, So that’s how it is. So he wasn’t really gaming, but using the game to divert his sight and only use his ears to listen out for the ball. So there’s actually such a training method. From the looks of it, the rumors of him being a gaming fanatic aren’t as simple as they seem. He’s more hardworking than anyone. Even gaming is a form of cultivation.</p>
<p>Clearly, Feng Qiuyan misunderstood Zhou Wen. In fact, gaming was his main goal and practicing his listening skills was just something he did in passing.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen walk out of the court, Feng Qiuyan suddenly snapped to attention as though he had awoken from a dream. He chased after him and called, “Zhou Wen, wait a moment.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter117'>Chapter 117 Please Be My Coach</h3>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Seeing Feng Qiuyan chase after him, Zhou Wen could only stop and turn his head to look at him.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan stared at him and enunciated each and every word as he said, “I want to hire you as my personal coach. Help tailor a training plan for me.”</p>
<p>“You want me to be your personal coach?” Zhou Wen pointed at his nose and asked in surprise.</p>
<p>He did not believe that he had the talent to make training plans. His own plan was to game after gaming, ad infinitum.</p>
<p>“Please don’t reject me. If you have any conditions, feel free to raise them. Money isn’t a problem.” Feng Qiuyan was quite sincere.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already opened his mouth, prepared to reject the offer, but upon hearing the words “money isn’t a problem,” he swallowed the words he was about to say.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you want me to be your personal coach and tailor training plans for you? I’m only a Mortal-grade student.” Zhou Wen looked at Feng Qiuyan and confirmed it once again.</p>
<p>“Your level is not a problem. I just want to know your training methods. If you find it troublesome, you don’t have to deliberately plan one for me. I just need to train with you. I’ll do whatever you do,” Feng Qiuyan said with all seriousness.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan clearly misunderstood Zhou Wen, believing that he, who could think of using his sense of hearing to train his strikes, definitely had plans for targeted training. Therefore, he wanted to hire Zhou Wen as his personal coach.</p>
<p>He wanted to know how Zhou Wen had trained to his present standards. Perhaps, it could aid him in his cultivation, allowing him to break through his recent bottleneck.</p>
<p>“I’m very expensive.” Zhou Wen didn’t think too much about it. Since there was a chance for him to earn money, there was no reason not to.</p>
<p>“I’ll pay you what it costs to hire the most expensive personal coaches on the market. The payment can be made monthly or per class. If you have any other requests, you can tell me now,” said Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>“It’s best we settle it according to class, so a payment for each class.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and realized that he didn’t have much to teach. He decided to teach a lesson first and if he really couldn’t handle it, he wouldn’t keep scamming Feng Qiuyan-one class would be all.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Feng Qiuyan agreed without hesitation. He paid Zhou Wen for one class and eagerly asked, “Coach, what kind of training do we have for the first class?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment before asking, “You use the saber, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. I train to push my swift saber to the pinnacle and I pursue extreme speed.” Feng Qiuyan looked at Zhou Wen with anticipation. He hoped that Zhou Wen could give him some special training method to aid his breakthrough.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pondered for a while when he heard that. He suddenly realized that he didn’t know any saber techniques, nor had he practiced any of them. The only thing he knew that had anything to do with sabers was Astral Slash Blade.</p>
<p>However, Astral Slash Blade was a Primordial Energy Skill that resembled a blade beam. It did not have any technique to speak of, as it was cleaved out directly without any need for cultivation.</p>
<p>Despite thinking all day, Zhou Wen couldn’t think of a training plan tailored to Feng Qiuyan’s cultivation.</p>
<p>Suddenly, an idea flashed in Zhou Wen’s mind as he thought of the word-engraved Demonized General in Tiger Cage Pass.</p>
<p>The word-engraved Demonized General had three different types. The Blade Demonized General’s Astral Slash Blade was fast and ruthless, but it could only suppress the Paper Demonized General and was useless against the Fist Demonized General.</p>
<p>Although a swift saber was formidable, there were also ways to counter one.</p>
<p>In any case, I don’t know any saber techniques yet. I’ll make Feng Qiuyan practice his saber in a diametrically opposite manner. When the time comes, he’ll find something amiss and won’t come looking for me again. Realizing how quick Feng Qiuyan was to pay him, he found him quite a nice guy and didn’t wish to scam him further.</p>
<p>“Feng Qiuyan, have you ever heard of the principle of extreme Yang gives birth to Yin?” Zhou Wen asked Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>“Are you referring to how things develop in an opposite direction when they go to the extreme?” Feng Qiuyan asked after some thought.</p>
<p>“It’s almost the same. The ancients say that true wisdom sounds foolish and great skill looks clumsy. It’s possible to have the opposite effect once you reach an extreme. You practice in the swift saber, then perhaps one day, if you feel slow drawing your saber, it might mean that your saber techniques can improve further,” Zhou Wen said in a cursory manner, hoping that he could satisfy Feng Qiuyan for now, so that he wouldn’t seek him out again.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan took Zhou Wen’s words seriously as he asked, “Then, how do I train to reach the realm of the slow saber?”</p>
<p>“Some things require you to figure it out yourself. No matter how well others explain it, that’s still someone else’s insight. Only something you figure out is yours. I have already given you direction. As for how you should do it, it will require you to think about it.” Although Zhou Wen was bullsh*tting Feng Qiuyan, what he said was truly what he believed in and understood. It wasn’t complete nonsense.</p>
<p>After managing to get rid of Feng Qiuyan with great difficulty, Zhou Wen jogged back to his dorm and lay comfortably in bed as he took out his mysterious phone.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was his luck. This time, while he was grinding the Lotus Flower Cave, although he failed to obtain a Rank 9 Dragon Gate Fairy Skill, he managed to obtain a Fairy Monkey Companion Egg</p>
<p>Fairy Beast: Legendary</p>
<p>Life Providence: Pet of Air</p>
<p>Strength: 15</p>
<p>Speed: 18</p>
<p>Constitution: 15</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 14</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Dragon Gate Fairy Skill</p>
<p>Companion Form: Wings</p>
<p>The Fairy Monkey’s stats were clearly incomparable to the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, so he directly fed the Companion Egg to Truth Listener.</p>
<p>In the past, Truth Listener didn’t react much after eating a Companion Egg. However, after swallowing the Companion Egg this time, a system notification appeared.</p>
<p>‘Truth Listener has obtained the evolution requirement and is beginning to evolve.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw Truth Listener’s figure appear on the screen. It was a tiny beast in the shape of a golden silk monkey. At this moment, Truth Listener was glowing with resplendent golden light, as though it was a golden Buddha statue. It was so blinding that it filled the entire screen with golden light.</p>
<p>After feeding it for so long, it’s finally evolving. Zhou Wen was delighted.</p>
<p>Truth Listener at the Mortal stage was not of much use. However, it would definitely be very useful after advancing to the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>After a while, the golden light on the screen gradually faded away, revealing its true looks. At the same time, a system notification popped up on the screen: ‘Truth Listener’s evolution completed.’</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t seem to notice much of a change. Its body was still small, only slightly bigger than his fingers. It was covered in golden fur and its eyes were sparkling with golden light.</p>
<p>No, it’s still a little different. Zhou Wen realized that Truth Listener was indeed somewhat different. It originally resembled a golden silk monkey with just a pair of ears, but now it had another pair of ears. It now had four ears.</p>
<p>However, its ears were very small. They were neatly placed on both sides of its head without making it look ugly at all. If one didn’t look closely, one would not notice that it had four ears.</p>
<h3 id='chapter118'>Chapter 118 Heaven’s Senses</h3>
<p>Truth Listener: Legendary (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Heaven’s Senses</p>
<p>Strength: 21</p>
<p>Speed: 21</p>
<p>Constitution: 21</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 21</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Truth Listener, Indestructible Golden Body, Evil Warding, Nine Extremes</p>
<p>Companion Form: Earring</p>
<p>In the past, Zhou Wen thought that the maximum stats for Legendaries was 18. He later found through the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant and Silver-Winged Flying Ant that 18 wasn’t the limit, but he had never seen 21.</p>
<p>Mythical creatures are really different. Even if they haven’t evolved to the Mythical stage, their stats aren’t something ordinary Companion Beasts can compare with. However, I have no idea what exact use Heaven’s Senses has. Zhou Wen read Truth Listener’s stats carefully and saw that there was an additional note regarding the Life Providence: Prying into the secrets of the world using ears instead of eyes.</p>
<p>When he summoned Truth Listener, it still looked petite. It was glowing with golden light as if it was a piece of golden silk monkey art carved out of gold.</p>
<p>From its appearance, it did not seem powerful at all. The Legendary Mutated Skeleton Ant that shared its level looked many times stronger than it.</p>
<p>Getting Truth Listener to turn into an earring before wearing it, Zhou Wen closed his eyes and focused. He immediately felt that the Truth Listener earring had augmented his sense of hearing in a way that was much better than before.</p>
<p>Although he had his eyes closed, everything around him appeared like a three-dimensional figure in his mind. It was as though Zhou Wen could see everything around him. The only difference was that the three-dimensional figure in his mind was black and white instead of the colored world he saw with his eyes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that he wasn’t really seeing anything, but the ability brought by the Truth Listener earring</p>
<p>He originally believed that he had no way of hearing a still object no matter how good his hearing was. But now, he realized that what he believed was wrong.</p>
<p>No object existed independently. Although some objects were still, the movement of other objects would similarly affect them. As long as his hearing was powerful enough, he could replace his eyes with his ears to see still objects.</p>
<p>The flow of air and the sound waves produced feedback the moment they touched a still object. The average person couldn’t hear such feedback, but the Truth Listener earring allowed Zhou Wen to hear it clearly. Furthermore, it outlined a three-dimensional figure in his mind, as though he was looking at it with his own eyes. There were even more details than could be seen with open eyes.</p>
<p>Within twenty meters, even if there were obstructions, Zhou Wen could still see everything behind the walls with his ears. It was as if he had x-ray vision. Other than the lack of colors, everything else was no different from normal vision.</p>
<p>With this strange sense of hearing, Zhou Wen could clearly hear everything in the two buildings beside him. The sound-proofing was completely ineffective against him.</p>
<p>While Wang Lu wasn’t in the dorm, An Jing happened to be in the bedroom near to Zhou Wen. He didn’t have a fetish for invading privacies, so just as he was about to retract his hearing, he heard An Jing say, “Zhou Wen still hasn’t cultivated in the Sun Strafe Art. Was the harm I dealt him last time that great? Did I really go too far?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. If he hadn’t identified that the person speaking was clearly An Jing, he would have believed that he had heard wrongly.</p>
<p>His impression of An Jing was always one that was haughty and aloof as if she viewed everything in a condescending manner. It was hard to imagine that these words came from her mouth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but feel curious. He wanted to hear what An Jing would say, so he didn’t put away the Truth Listener earring and continued listening to the commotion next door.</p>
<p>The usually cold and arrogant An Jing was now sitting on the bed with a teddy bear in hand. It was as if she was speaking to the bear. “I didn’t really want to hurt him. I just wanted to prove myself. I just want to let Grandpa know that Mom’s choice was wrong. Her child is the best, far more excellent than the genius described by Grandpa. I know Zhou Wen is innocent and this matter has nothing to do with him, but apart from defeating him, I didn’t have any way of proving to Grandpa that I’m better than him. I really didn’t want to set him back.”</p>
<p>“Bear Bear, what do I have to do to make him stand back on his feet?” An Jing paused before adding, “It’s not that I care about him. It’s just that if he can’t get back on his feet and advance to the Legendary stage, my defeat of him will be meaningless. It still wouldn’t prove to Grandpa that I’m better than him. So I must first help him establish his confidence and then help him advance to the Legendary stage. I’ll defeat him when he’s at tip-top shape. This will let Grandpa know that his daughter’s child is the best. Mom’s decision to marry Dad was right.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Zhou Wen stopped listening and put away the Truth Listener earring.</p>
<p>Now, he finally understood why An Jing was targeting him. It was not because of Zhou Lingfeng and Ouyang Lan’s marriage, nor was it simply because of that special physique.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t concerned that An Jing was upset with him. He only hoped that An Jing would not disturb him in the future. It was best if they minded their own business.</p>
<p>Now, all Zhou Wen wanted to do was game in peace. The fewer things he had to do, the better.</p>
<p>As usual, he first killed all the mini-bosses in the dungeons before heading to Fire God Platform to memorize the Ancient Imperial Sutra. Just as he was doing it the second time, the doorbell rang.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen opened the door and saw that it was Li Xuan, who he hadn’t seen in days.</p>
<p>Li Xuan wore a smug look as he patted Zhou Wen on the shoulder. “Brat, I’ll be protecting you in the future. If there’s anyone who dares bully you, just give them my name.”</p>
<p>“You aren’t sick, are you?” Zhou Wen swatted away Li Xuan’s hand and sat down on the couch. He poured himself a cup of blood-replenishing tea and slowly drank it.</p>
<p>Li Xuan smugly sat down beside Zhou Wen and wrapped his arm around his shoulder. Suppressing his excitement, he deliberately whispered, “Old Zhou, I finally succeeded in advancing to the Legendary stage. Guess what my Life Providence is?”</p>
<p>“I’m not guessing. I’m not interested.” Zhou Wen continued drinking his tea.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan still said excitedly, “I doubt you can guess it anyway. Let me tell you, my Legendary Life Providence is Immortal God of Combat. Isn’t that impressive? Just the sound of the name makes it freaking awesome. I’m not bragging, but this Life Providence pretty much means invincibility-an immortal body, a supreme Dominance Body. People like Yang Lie will be exhausted to death beating me while I stand there, completely unmoved…”</p>
<p>When Li Xuan said this, he stood up and jumped onto the couch. He made an arrogant pose, his eyes filled with contempt as though he was looking down on everyone in the world.</p>
<p>But as soon as he finished speaking, he was kicked down by the sleeping antelope.</p>
<p>The antelope had already treated the couch as its bed. For Li Xuan to have the guts to hop on its bed in his shoes, there was no way it was going to be friendly with him.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Li Xuan fell to the ground, his sternum sinking in with the shape of a hoof while he spewed out blood from his mouth.</p>
<p>“Isn’t… Isn’t that an antelope?” Li Xuan sprawled on the ground as he looked at the languid antelope in astonishment, his face wearing a look of disbelief.</p>
<h3 id='chapter119'>Chapter 119 Providence Palace</h3>
<p>Li Xuan had always believed that the antelope was a mutated animal from the bottom half of Mount Laojun. However, the power of its hooves made him realize that it was not only a dimensional creature but an extremely high-level one.</p>
<p>His Immortal God of Combat Life Providence had greatly augmented his Constitution. Although calling it an immortal and indestructible Dominance Body was an exaggeration, it wouldn’t be easy for mere Legendaries to injure him.</p>
<p>The antelope had severely injured him with a casual kick of its hoof. This was already beyond the strength of a Legendary level. It was highly likely an Epic stage existence.</p>
<p>“I’ll take you to the hospital.” Zhou Wen was also given a fright. Although the antelope had been staying at his place and refusing to leave, it had never hurt him.</p>
<p>Now, with this strike, it had severely injured Li Xuan, who had just ascended to the Legendary stage. It also confirmed Zhou Wen’s previous speculation that the antelope had terrifying strength.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. This small injury is nothing to me. The Immortal God of Combat Life Providence still means something.” Li Xuan shook his head and propped himself up, using the coffee table to stand up.</p>
<p>Li Xuan seemed to be enduring a great deal of pain in the beginning. Even breathing seemed to be unbearable, and his face was ghastly pale.</p>
<p>However, after taking a few deep breaths, his complexion gradually improved. The injury on his chest seemed to be slowly recovering.</p>
<p>“The Immortal God of Combat has a powerful self-recovery ability. As long as I’m alive, my injuries can slowly recover.” Li Xuan did not forget to boast about his Life Providence.</p>
<p>“Your Virgin God of Combat Life Providence sure is nice.” Zhou Wen was slightly surprised. This Life Providence was really impressive-it could be considered a life-saving skill.</p>
<p>“What Virgin God of Combat… It’s Immortal God of Combat… Cough…” Agitated, Li Xuan pulled at his internal injuries, causing him to cough out a lot of blood.</p>
<p>“It looks like your self-recovery powers won’t restore you that quickly. Let me take you to the hospital now.” Zhou Wen helped Li Xuan out.</p>
<p>Li Xuan originally wanted to say no, but when he saw the antelope on the couch, he shivered and left Zhou Wen’s dormitory with his neck shrank back.</p>
<p>“What’s with that antelope? Isn’t it a mutated animal from Mount Laojun?” Li Xuan asked in a suppressed voice after Zhou Wen helped him out of the building.</p>
<p>“I’m not too sure either. It’s been following me all this time, but it hasn’t injured anyone before. It’s the first time today,” Zhou Wen said honestly.</p>
<p>“I… Forget it… I’ll just blame it on my luck… There’s no need to go to the hospital. Let’s find a place to rest. I still have something to tell you.” Li Xuan felt depressed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sized Li Xuan up and asked, “Is your injury really alright?”</p>
<p>“It’s just a flesh wound and I’m not internally injured. Even if we don’t go to the hospital, it will only take a few days before I recover. It’ll be troublesome if we go to the hospital, but you be careful in the future. Don’t end up getting kicked to death by that animal,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>The two of them sat down on a long bench on the lawn. Li Xuan’s complexion was much better now, having appeared to have returned to normal. From the looks of it, he wasn’t just bragging. The Immortal God of Combat was indeed impressive.</p>
<p>It’s not bad to have a life-saving Life Providence like Li Xuan’s, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>“The school’s first comprehensive test is almost here. How’s your preparation going?” Li Xuan asked after taking a few deep breaths while on the long bench.</p>
<p>“What preparation?” Zhou Wen knew about the monthly comprehensive test, but he had no idea why he needed to prepare for it.</p>
<p>Li Xuan rolled his eyes at Zhou Wen speechlessly. “Let me guess. You didn’t read the syllabus for the comprehensive test?”</p>
<p>“No, has it been announced?” Zhou Wen shook his head slightly.</p>
<p>Li Xuan complained, “You really don’t know anything about the outside world. All you focus on is gaming. Every year, the first comprehensive test is the same. There are a total of four subjects—fishing a coin from a pot of oil, crossing a paper bridge, lifting stone tripod cauldrons, and sucking in the mountain and rivers. You need to pass two of these tests to pass. If you were to fail three of them, you would be dismissed from school.”</p>
<p>“Why do these names sound like acrobatic performances of the past?” Zhou Wen laughed.</p>
<p>“The names are indeed tacky, but they really aren’t easy. These tests are real tests of ability and not some sleight of hand used by acrobats on the street. Fishing out a coin from a pot of boiling oil uses real oil. To fish one out with one’s physical body is definitely impossible. Your hand will be crippled the moment you put it in. You need to have a Primordial Energy Skill covering your hand or have a protective Primordial Energy Skill to fish the coin out. Crossing the paper bridge is the easiest test to fail. It’s a paper bridge spanning a hundred meters. The bridge’s surface is made of thin calligraphic paper and tearing it when stepping over it will be considered a failure. Without a Primordial Energy Skill that imbues you with alacrity, there’s no way to cross it.</p>
<p>“The lifting of the stone tripod cauldron is easy. As long as you have enough Strength, using some Primordial Energy Skill that enhances Strength will allow you to pass. It’s not difficult to devour the mountain and rivers either. As long as you have 9 points of Primordial Energy, you’ll basically pass. These are the basic requirements Sunset College sets. You should be fine for the latter two, but you need to prepare the first two. If you don’t have the type of Primordial Energy Skills required, I can lend you a few Primordial Energy Skill Crystals,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. I have my ways of passing.” Zhou Wen had Lotus Flower Buddha’s Primordial Energy Skill, so it shouldn’t be a problem to fish out a coin.</p>
<p>As for crossing the paper bridge, he also had Dragon Gate Fairy Skill. It wouldn’t be difficult for him to cross the bridge.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on completing all the tests since he could pass as long as he completed two tests. There was no need for him to participate in all four of them.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan said, “Don’t take this matter lightly. If you can squeeze into the top ten in the comprehensive test, you can get a chance to enter Providence Palace. Besides Sunset College. That’s an awesome place unique to Sunset College that you can’t find elsewhere.”</p>
<p>“Providence Palace?” Zhou Wen was surprised.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had heard of this name before. Providence Palace was actually the royal palace in the era of the Sui and Tang dynasty. Back then, Luoyang City was the capital and center of politics of the country and Providence Palace was the political center of Luoyang.</p>
<p>Later on, Providence Palace was later buried in history and was destroyed during a war. However, after the dimensional storms, its ruins formed a dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had heard a lot of rumors about the Providence Palace’s dimensional zone. It was a relatively special dimensional zone without much danger inside; yet, it was possible to obtain great opportunities inside.</p>
<p>In the past, when he was in high school, there were rumors of a certain student obtaining a particular treasure in Providence Palace and ended directly shooting to stardom, advancing to the Legendary or even the Epic stage.</p>
<p>Of course, they were only urban myths. The Providence Palace’s dimensional zone had always been under Sunset College’s control and had never been open to the public. Only a handful of Sunset College students had the qualification to enter. As for what benefits lay within, Zhou Wen really did not know what it was.</p>
<h3 id='chapter120'>Chapter 120 Providence Palace’s Treasures</h3>
<p>“I’ve already found out that there aren’t many areas in Providence Palace that have been cleared. We can only walk to the main entrance and can’t even enter the city gates. In fact, people do not even consider entering Providence Palace,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“If we can’t even get in, why are we heading there?” Zhou Wen asked puzzled.</p>
<p>“Don’t be anxious. Listen to me slowly.” Li Xuan acted all mysterious and continued, “Usually, the doors of Providence Palace are sealed shut. Even the most famous Epic experts would not be able to enter, much less us. That’s why no one knows what’s inside to date. However, one day every year, the city gates to Providence Palace will open. Many strange and magical items will appear from everywhere as though they are dragged by invisible ghosts, lining up to fly inside.”</p>
<p>“I heard that there are all sorts of treasures in there. There are rare antiques, weapons and armors, gemstones and jade, and all kinds of precious treasures. However, they are practically no use to us. True treasures are the Companion Eggs and dimensional crystals. Rumor has it that a senior once obtained a Companion Egg which was an Epic stage angel. You definitely know of angel Companion Beasts. They are dimensional creatures that only appear in the West District’s dimensional zone. Logically speaking, we shouldn’t have any angel Companion Eggs here,” Li Xuan said in a tone of mystery.</p>
<p>“Is that true?” Zhou Wen found Li Xuan’s words getting more and more outrageous as he found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>“Why would I lie to you? Someone from our Li family has already entered, but they didn’t pick anything good,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“According to what you’ve said, since there are so many good things in Providence Palace, why don’t they invite more people to head in to take them out? Why do they only allow the top ten in the comprehensive test in?” Zhou Wen still found it unbelievable as Li Xuan’s account didn’t make sense at all.</p>
<p>“Do you think anyone can choose what they want? When they first discovered the Providence Palace dimensional zone, they discovered ten tokens. On that day, only a person with a token had the right to choose one of the items to bring back. Those without the token couldn’t even touch anything inside. Those with a token could only choose one object, nothing more,” Li Xuan said in apparent seriousness.</p>
<p>Although Li Xuan’s words were bizarre, Zhou Wen knew that there was no need for him to lie. Instead, he was a little curious about Providence Palace.</p>
<p>Li Xuan smiled and said, “It’s useless to think too much now. If I want to choose something from Providence Palace, I’ll have to enter the top 10 at the comprehensive test or it’s useless. There are all kinds of experts in Sunset College, so even though I’ve advanced to the Legendary stage, I don’t have the confidence of squeezing into the top ten. Old Zhou, you haven’t even advanced to the Legendary stage. It will only be harder for you to enter the top ten. Ignoring everything else, there’s Huang Ji, Hui Haifeng, Wang Lu, Feng Qiuyan, and that sister of yours. Those five people will definitely enter the top ten, occupying five spots. The remaining five spots have many powerful fellows vying for it. I’m sure I can enter the top ten given a year or two, but now, it’s a little hard to say.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know many students at Sunset College, but he knew all of the people Li Xuan mentioned.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing wrong with the rest, but Wang Lu hasn’t advanced to the Legendary stage yet, right? How do you know that she would definitely be able to take up a spot?” Zhou Wen looked at Li Xuan suspiciously.</p>
<p>“Do you really not know it or are you faking it? The Wang family’s Wang Lu cultivates in the Youth Rejuvenation Divine Art. If she can’t take the spot, who else can?” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was confused by what he heard. Seeing that he did not know anything, Li Xuan explained in detail to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The Youth Rejuvenation Divine Art was the Wang family’s Primordial Energy Art which few outsiders knew much about. After cultivating this Primordial Energy Art, the first breakthrough would result in someone regaining their youth.</p>
<p>The youth here didn’t mean age, but the drop of one’s stage to the Mortal stage. At the same time, one’s physique and talent would improve tremendously. Not only was advancing quick, but one’s attainment was higher when redoing the cultivation.</p>
<p>Wang Lu’s first advancement to the Legendary stage happened when she was about the same age as An Jing. However, after the advancement, the effects of the Youth Rejuvenation reduced her back to the Mortal stage. She needed to cultivate and advance to the Legendary stage again, but she wouldn’t suffer a repeat.</p>
<p>However, after Wang Lu advanced to the Epic stage, she would experience the effect of Youth Rejuvenation again. She would still drop to the Mortal stage and have to cultivate again.</p>
<p>“Wang Lu definitely must have taken a liking to the opportunity of Providence Palace by choosing to study at Sunset College. Before the comprehensive test, she will definitely be able to advance back to the Legendary stage,” Li Xuan said with great certainty.</p>
<p>“I see.” Only then did Zhou Wen realize that Wang Lu actually had such a story.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I’ve already informed you. Think about it yourself. Call me if you need anything.” Li Xuan rubbed his chest and got up to leave.</p>
<p>His Invincible Connate Divine Art Life Providence and Invincible Connate Divine Art could heal his body quickly, but the pain didn’t lessen one bit.</p>
<p>After Li Xuan left, Zhou Wen had been thinking about the comprehensive test.</p>
<p>If it was only a competition for placement, Zhou Wen definitely wouldn’t have wanted to vie for it. However, the items in Providence Palace were quite attractive to him.</p>
<p>Even if the other students were to compete, they could only choose one at most. However, Zhou Wen was wondering if he could download Providence Palace to his phone and choose multiple items.</p>
<p>To verify this thought, he had to download Providence Palace first. However, if he didn’t enter the top ten, he wouldn’t have the chance to get there and naturally wouldn’t have the chance to download the dungeon.</p>
<p>It looks like I’ll have to try for this spot. Zhou Wen made up his mind to vie for it, but he wasn’t sure if he could get the nomination.</p>
<p>The four projects tested the students’ Speed, Strength, Constitution, and Primordial Energy respectively. Zhou Wen’s four attributes were stronger than anyone else of the same level, but compared to those at the Legendary stage, he was still very much inferior.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, the comprehensive test allows the use of Companion Beasts. It’s not like I don’t have a chance at all.” After Zhou Wen returned to his room, he began crazily grinding again.</p>
<p>In the past few days, Zhou Wen’s luck had seemed pretty good. When he was grinding Lotus Flower Cave, another Fairy Monkey Companion Egg was dropped. Furthermore, its attributes were extremely high.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t bear to use it as food. Finally, he steeled his heart and fused the Fairy Monkey Companion Egg with the Stone Qilin Companion Egg.</p>
<p>If he could get an excellent-grade Companion Egg with two skills, Zhou Wen decided to take the risk to incubate it.</p>
<p>However, with a 65% compatibility score, the fusion failed. With a loud bang from the phone, the two Companion Eggs vanished.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was already mentally prepared for failure, he still felt depressed when he saw the two Companion Eggs disappear.</p>
<p>Gambling is indeed a terrible thing. Zhou Wen sighed and could only continue grinding.</p>
<h3 id='chapter121'>Chapter 121 Untouchable Stone Saber</h3>
<p>“Overseer, there’s news from the League that a dimensional creature broke out from the sea and has infiltrated the East district. It might be coming to us,” Ah Sheng said as he held a document that had just been faxed over.</p>
<p>“What level is the dimensional creature?” An Tianzuo frowned and asked.</p>
<p>“I’m not too sure yet, but from the description of the document, it didn’t easily break through the coastal defenses and even suffered some injuries. It should be an ordinary Epic stage creature,” Ah Sheng looked at the document and said, “However, after it charged through the coastal defenses, the League hasn’t been able to track it. They occasionally discover its traces and from its trajectory, it might pass through Luoyang. The League wants us to cooperate in stopping it. Overseer, what’s your take on this?”</p>
<p>“Strengthen the defenses and distribute the newly researched Primordial Gold bullets. Even if you can’t kill it here, you can’t let it do as it pleases in Luoyang,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“Yes, Overseer.” Ah Sheng received the order and left.</p>
<p>With the help of the Legendary Truth Listener earring, Zhou Wen felt like a fish in water. A few days later, he finally managed to remember all the content of the Ancient Imperial Sutra.</p>
<p>The moment he finished memorizing the Ancient Imperial Sutra, he felt as if every cell in his body was igniting. His entire body became extremely hot, almost to the point of burning</p>
<p>As for the firebird horde that charged towards the blood-colored avatar, they retreated and returned to the furnace in front of the stone monument.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen thought his body was about to explode, the Lost Immortal Sutra came into effect, causing his body to turn completely still.</p>
<p>In the next second, his Primordial Energy began circulating again. However, it was no longer the path of the Lost Immortal Sutra. It became the Ancient Imperial Sutra that Zhou Wen had just memorized.</p>
<p>The Ancient Imperial Sutra could be described with one word-overbearing. Wherever Primordial Energy flowed, Zhou Wen felt as though all his cells had turned into explosives that could explode with unparalleled power.</p>
<p>That searing, potent, and oppressive power was something Zhou Wen had never experienced in any of the other Primordial Energy Arts he cultivated in.</p>
<p>However, this overbearing power made him feel brimming with energy and vitality instead of destruction.</p>
<p>When the Ancient Imperial Sutra completed a cycle, Zhou Wen felt a strange change in his body. It was as though a casual punch could cause a rupture in the world.</p>
<p>Looking at the blood-colored avatar’s stats, he discovered that the values of the four attributes had changed from 10 to 11 points. Now, Zhou Wen had three stats at 11, leaving only one stat at 10.</p>
<p>As he had mastered the Ancient Imperial Sutra to a basic level, the blood-colored avatar could stand near the Fire God Platform without firebirds appearing to attack him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to walk up to the Fire God Platform. The flames inside the furnace flickered but did not spew out any firebirds.</p>
<p>He originally thought that Fire God Platform would give him a Companion Egg, but he was ultimately disappointed. There was only a stone monument and a stone furnace on Fire</p>
<p>1 Platform, nothing else; hence, there was no one to give him a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>So not every place has a Mythical Companion Egg to give! Zhou Wen didn’t feel disappointed as he carefully observed the stone monument and furnace.</p>
<p>He had already noted down the words on the monument. Furthermore, he had already gained a basic mastery of the Ancient Imperial Sutra, so there was nothing special about it.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the stone furnace was rather strange and Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be even more meticulous studying it.</p>
<p>There were many firebird symbols on the outside of the stone furnace, but upon closer inspection, he realized that they were not firebirds but fire plumes of different shapes.</p>
<p>There was something in the furnace that was burning with scarlet flames.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at it for a while before identifying it as a stone saber. It was in the furnace flames that burned vigorously. This only allowed him to make out its blurry outline.</p>
<p>Is the stone saber in the furnace also a Companion Egg? Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat as he made the blood-colored avatar attempt to remove the saber from the furnace.</p>
<p>Since it was only a waste of a blood drop if the blood-colored avatar were to die, Zhou Wen was not stingy with making such attempts.</p>
<p>After circulating the Ancient Imperial Sutra to its limit, the blood-colored avatar’s palm reached into the stone furnace. The flames in the furnace automatically parted, as though they were welcoming his hand.</p>
<p>The flames split apart, revealing the stone saber stuck in the middle of the stone furnace. Zhou Wen could now see it clearly instead of a blurry outline.</p>
<p>The first impression that he had of the stone saber was that it was rough. It was ground from black stone with many rough edges and uneven pot marks. It was nothing perfect or exquisite.</p>
<p>However, this stone saber gave Zhou Wen an extremely oppressive feeling. It was as though it was the only thing that could claim to be supreme in the entire world as an ancient and desolate aura inundated him.</p>
<p>On one side of the stone saber, there was a bloodstain. The blood-red color coupled with its shape made it look like a blood-red bolt of lightning</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, he controlled the blood-colored avatar to grab the handle, hoping to pull the stone saber out of the furnace.</p>
<p>However, when the blood-colored avatar’s palm touched the stone saber, Zhou Wen was stunned. The blood-colored avatar’s palm seemed to pass through an illusion and did not touch it.</p>
<p>Why is this happening? Zhou Wen tried a few more times, but the result was the same. The stone saber did not seem to exist at all as though it was only an illusion. It was futile no matter how the blood-colored avatar tried to grab it. Time and again, its palm would pass through it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen spent a long time studying the situation on Fire God Platform without figuring out what was going on.</p>
<p>Could it be that the stone saber is really just an illusion? Zhou Wen stared at the stone saber in the game, but it didn’t look like an illusion at all, because the aura of the saber was just too potent. How could an illusion have such an aura?</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen had the urge to immediately return to Guide Ancient City and scale the Fire God Platform in reality. He wanted to see if there was a stone saber in the furnace.</p>
<p>That was just an impulsive thought after all. It was impossible for him to return to the Guide Ancient City, so he could only give up on his plan of obtaining the stone saber and leave the Ancient Imperial City dungeon.</p>
<p>My three stats have already reached 11 points, so how can I find a Primordial Energy Art to increase my Speed to 11 points? Zhou Wen only wanted to quickly advance to the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>Being at the Mortal stage was just too weak. He would be slaughtered if he encountered true experts. Furthermore, only by advancing to the Legendary stage could he incubate Legendary Companion Eggs without any worries.</p>
<p>Armor, weapons, necklaces, and other Companion Beasts were very helpful in improving his strength.</p>
<p>After careful consideration, Zhou Wen headed to the college library. He wanted to see if there were any other mysterious dimensional zones in Luoyang that had Primordial Energy Arts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he didn’t find anything similar to Small Buddha Temple or Mount Laojun. At least in Luoyang, there was no place like that.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen browsed through the other dimensional zones in the League. He made some decent discoveries through this search.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was checking the information, he suddenly heard a loud boom. The entire library was shaking violently as a large amount of cement fell from above.</p>
<h3 id='chapter122'>Chapter 122 The Library Incident</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately activated his Lotus Flower Buddha Body. At the same time, he extended his silver wings and retreated more than 10 meters. His left hand, which was wrapped by the lotus flower bracer, shattered the large piece of concrete steel that came crashing towards him.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Amidst the splattering dust and plaster, Zhou Wen saw a huge green-scaled snake falling down from the hole in the roof. It shattered the bookshelf and the wood fragments flew everywhere as the ground opened up into a huge crater.</p>
<p>A large number of fragments smashed onto Zhou Wen. Thankfully, he had already activated Lotus Flower Buddha Body, so none of the flying rubble harmed his body.</p>
<p>The green-scaled snake was extremely large, spanning more than a hundred meters long. It was as thick as a water barrel and on its back was a pair of gigantic wing-like fins.</p>
<p>The students in the library dodged and screamed as they ran out. Although Zhou Wen didn’t know what was going on, he knew that he couldn’t stay here for long. Just as he was about to flee the library, he saw the huge snake open its enormous mouth in a bid to devour a student.</p>
<p>The student was too close to the spot where the snake had landed. A flying fragment of a steel slab had pierced through her calf and her body was pinned to the ground. She could not free herself to escape.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a look and realized that the student was Fang Ruoxi. With a thought, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant immediately separated from him and transformed into a silver stream of light, pulling her out before the snake could devour her.</p>
<p>The Silver-Winged Flying Ant carried the injured Fang Ruoxi and flew back to Zhou Wen’s side. The enraged snake lifted its neck and opened its mouth, wanting to lunge towards him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was just about to flee when he suddenly heard a series of gunshots. A large number of soldiers jumped down from the hole and held their assault rifles in their hands. They fired unceasingly at the snake.</p>
<p>Typically hot weapons had limited impact on dimensional creatures even with nuclear bombs, much less bullets. They might even accelerate the mutation of dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>However, when the soldiers’ bullets hit the snake, they pierced through the scales and caused it to bleed. The snake began to twist its body and cry out as it tried to escape.</p>
<p>However, it was already too late for it to escape. The soldiers continued firing at it. In just a few seconds, the gigantic snake had become riddled with holes. The snake’s blood was everywhere.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, are you alright?” A young man who looked like an officer rushed over and sized Zhou Wen up before asking anxiously.</p>
<p>“I’m fine.” Zhou Wen recognized the officer to be An Tianzuo’s adjutant, Ah Sheng.</p>
<p>“It’s good that you’re fine. Young Master Wen, you can go back now. There are still some matters to settle here.” Ah Sheng called two soldiers over and asked them to escort Zhou Wen and Fang Ruoxi out of the library.</p>
<p>Fang Ruoxi’s calf was injured and the steel slab was still piercing through it. Thankfully, the injury was not serious. The moment they left the library, the medical team rushed over with a doctor to treat Fang Ruoxi.</p>
<p>“Thank you Zhou Wen. You took the risk to save me even though I treated you badly in the past,” Fang Ruoxi said to Zhou Wen. She had been brooding over the fact that she had failed to form a team with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. It wasn’t much of a risk. If it were any other student, I would also have saved them. You don’t have to think too much.” Zhou Wen turned around and left.</p>
<p>The middle-aged female doctor who was treating Fang Ruoxi’s wound almost burst out laughing when she saw the disappointment on Fang Ruoxi’s face. She said, “Young lady, there’s no loss missing out on such insensitive men. It’s how he acts that makes him single. It will save you a lot of woe in the future.”</p>
<p>Fang Ruoxi blushed. “We’re just ordinary classmates, don’t think too much.”</p>
<p>The incident at the library caused quite a commotion on campus. The students were all discussing this matter.</p>
<p>The college also gave an official account that a criminal was escaping with a Companion Beast and ended up entering the college accidentally under the military’s pursuit. The criminal and the Companion Beast were both killed on the spot by the military.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen the gigantic snake with his own eyes, but he didn’t feel that it was a Companion Beast with an owner. It resembled more of a feral dimensional creature.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen himself also felt that it was impossible. After all, feral dimensional creatures weren’t able to leave their dimensional zones. However, when he thought of the antelope in his dorm, he felt that it wasn’t exactly possible.</p>
<p>If all dimensional creatures can rush out of their dimensional zones, what would the human world become? Zhou Wen could not help but shudder when he thought of this possibility.</p>
<p>The number of human experts had increased over the past few decades and Epic experts were no longer rare. But compared to those dimensional creatures, they were still far inferior.</p>
<p>Ignoring everything else, just like the three-faced Buddha in Small Buddha Temple and the expert who didn’t even show his face at Mount Laojun, they were probably existences that few humans could match.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there were many places like this on Earth.</p>
<p>If there really comes a day when dimensional creatures are able to rush out of the dimensional zones, it would be the end of the world for humans. One must be strong enough to survive. Zhou Wen felt that the day wasn’t too distant. The examples of the antelope and the snake made his sense of danger tingling.</p>
<p>I still need to increase my strength. Zhou Wen felt the urgency to improve his strength-he needed to have the ability to survive in such a disaster.</p>
<p>After returning to his dorm, he decided to take a shower and change out of his tattered clothes and dirt-covered clothes before taking a shower to continue gaming.</p>
<p>However, when he removed his clothes, he realized that there was a clamshell the size of an egg on the inside of his shirt.</p>
<p>The clamshell’s rainbow colors made it extremely beautiful. Zhou Wen casually pulled it off and was about to throw it away when he noticed something while holding it in his hand.</p>
<p>Inside the clamshell was filled with blue seawater. Even if the clamshell was facing downwards, not a single drop of seawater stirred, it all remained inside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was a little surprised to suddenly see waves rise up from the seawater. Ripples spread out and something slowly floated up in the middle.</p>
<p>He was alarmed as he quickly threw away the clamshell. At the same time, he summoned his Companion Beasts and fused with them to prepare for battle.</p>
<p>However, the clamshell that Zhou Wen threw was floating in mid-air. A petite, beautiful figure emerged from the rippling seawater.</p>
<p>It was a mermaid-like creature with a head of golden wavy hair. However, her ears looked like fish fins and her eyes were blue like the sea, seemingly possessing an indescribable charm.</p>
<p>Is this a mermaid or a siren? Zhou Wen frowned slightly. He was now sure that this was definitely a feral dimensional creature.</p>
<h3 id='chapter123'>Chapter 123 The First Order of Chaos</h3>
<p>Without much hesitation, the moment he saw the siren-like mermaid appear, the transparent wings on Zhou Wen’s back vibrated and he slammed his feet on the ground, wanting to rush out from the balcony.</p>
<p>There were too many unknown and terrifying existences in this world. Regardless of his chances of defeating a siren, Zhou Wen was unwilling to risk it.</p>
<p>But just as he moved, a large amount of seawater burst out from the clamshell behind the siren. The egg-sized clamshell spewed out seawater like a waterfall that engulfed the entire living room.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body collided with the waterfall formed by the seawater and immediately felt his body being pushed back into the living room like a wave.</p>
<p>“Keke, foolish human. When standing before the Queen of the Sea, resistance is futile. Your only option is to become my slave and be used by me.” The siren’s body gradually walked out of the clamshell and gradually grew in size, becoming as big as an ordinary human.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gathered his Strength and repeatedly slammed into the waterfall formed by the seawater. He was repelled every time. Even Astral Slash Blade left a tiny crack when he slashed down on the waterfall before the hole disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>“It’s useless, foolish human. Stop doing such foolish acts and become my slave.” As the siren spoke, a strange light shone in her blue eyes, exuding an indescribable charm.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s gaze landed on the strange pair of eyes and his eyes immediately lost focus. As though in a trance, he dazedly walked towards the siren.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. Come into my embrace and be my slave. It’s a great honor for a human…” She spread out her arms and embraced Zhou Wen like a mother. At the same time, she was about to plant her pale-blue lips on his forehead.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued walking towards the siren in a daze, as though he was unaware of everything. All that was left in his eyes was the reflection of the siren’s strange eyes.</p>
<p>The siren’s hands were already on Zhou Wen’s shoulders and her lips were about to be planted on Zhou Wen’s forehead when his originally dull eyes turned clear and limpid. His left hand which was wrapped in a lotus bracer rose up as his palm brought a Astral Slash Blade beam, slicing it straight at the siren’s abdomen.</p>
<p>With the augmentation of the lotus bracer, the Astral Slash Blade beam that combined 11 points of Primordial Energy violently struck the belly of the siren, leaving a mark on it. This act stunned the beautiful face of the siren.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was overconfidence or that she didn’t expect Zhou Wen to remain clear-headed under her gaze, the siren failed to react completely as she looked at Zhou Wen in disbelief.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate at all. His entire body rose up in an instant. He rained down his fists and knees like a thunderstorm, attacking the vital spots of the siren.</p>
<p>The Mutated Lotus Flower Ant and the Silver-Winged Flying Ant were also summoned by Zhou Wen. They surrounded the siren on both sides, trying hard to severely injure the siren in the shortest time possible so that she wouldn’t be capable of counterattacking.</p>
<p>Bam! Bam! Bam!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched as the arm of the siren moved. Then, he and his two Companion Beasts retreated at the same time, slamming into the seawater waterfall before bouncing back and falling onto the ground.</p>
<p>The siren stared coldly at Zhou Wen, her fingers touching the wound on her abdomen. The wound had strangely healed, not leaving any scars behind.</p>
<p>“Humans are despicable. They do not heed well-meaning advice, forcing me to take action myself.” The siren stared coldly at Zhou Wen and swung its tail towards him.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The moment the siren finished speaking, a hoof fell from above, knocking her down along with the clamshell. This caused the seawater waterfall, enclosing the living room to collapse, restoring the living room to its original appearance.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that the siren was slumped on the floor and could not stand up no matter how hard she struggled. On her back, the white antelope was standing leisurely with its hooves stepping on her. It was as if it wasn’t stepping on a terrifying dimensional creature, but a block of wood.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say another word as he immediately changed the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant into a bracer and sliced at the siren’s neck.</p>
<p>The siren was most likely an Epic creature. No matter what dropped from killing her, it would fetch a good price. This was undoubtedly very tempting for the broke Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Of course, the main reason was to resolve any possible problems. He couldn’t allow such a dangerous dimensional creature to continue living. This was too dangerous for Zhou Wen and his classmates.</p>
<p>“Don’t kill me! As long as you’re willing to let me go, I can share a huge secret with you,” the siren hurriedly shouted.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen ignored her and slit her neck with the edge of the lotus bracer. However, it only left a faint red mark on her fair neck. All he managed was a slight laceration.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was a little shocked. The lotus bracer was already considered a top-notch weapon amongst Legendaries, but it could only tear open a tiny part of her skin. It was probably that this siren was a top existence among Epic creatures.</p>
<p>“Brother Antelope, why don’t you help me get rid of her?” Zhou Wen said as he looked at the antelope on the siren’s back.</p>
<p>Unless Zhou Wen’s Primordial Energy was restored, allowing him to use Astral Slash Blade matched with his lotus bracer, it wouldn’t be easy for him to kill this siren.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, the siren hurriedly exclaimed, “I really have a huge secret to share with you. I’ve obtained the First Order of Chaos from the primordial god, Chaos. If you are willing to let me go, I can share it with you.”</p>
<p>“What First Order of Chaos?” Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he looked at the siren on the ground and asked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had heard of the name Chaos before. It was a primordial god in Greek mythology. It was the first god to be born in Greek mythology.</p>
<p>It was just that this god was not well-known in the world, but his descendants were famous, ones that many knew.</p>
<p>For example, the third generation god-king from Chaos’s family line, Zeus of Olympus; Sea King, Poseidon; the Goddess of Wisdom, Athena; and Sun God, Apollo, were descendants of this god.</p>
<p>Some people said that Chaos was one of the celestial gods of Time, Space, and Space-time. Others said that Chaos was chaos itself. In any case, the status of this god in Greek mythology was akin to the Chinese myth of Pangu’s splitting of the primordial egg.</p>
<p>When the siren mentioned this name, Zhou Wen was rather surprised.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had heard that in some of the dimensional zones in the West District, many dimensional zones related to Zeus and the other gods were found. There were even second-generation Titans found in some dimensional zones. However, he had never heard any news about Chaos.</p>
<p>“The First Order of Chaos is the source of Lord Chaos’s power. To you humans, that is Lord Chao’s Primordial Energy Art,” the siren hurriedly said.</p>
<h3 id='chapter124'>Chapter 124 Crystal Ball</h3>
<p>“Did you bring out the First Order of Chaos? Is it the original version?” Zhou Wen didn’t really believe that the siren could obtain the original version of Chaos’s Primordial Energy Art.</p>
<p>Although to Zhou Wen, the siren was very powerful, she was definitely not a top-notch expert among dimensional creatures. There were too many dimensional creatures that could kill her.</p>
<p>For something as valuable as Chaos’s Primordial Energy Art, it was possible if the siren had taken out a copy, but the original copy was probably something not even Mythical experts would move around casually, let alone a mere siren.</p>
<p>However, a copy was useless to Zhou Wen. The Lost Immortal Sutra needed the original version of the Primordial Energy Art to do its magic.</p>
<p>The siren said, “Of course it’s the original version. Don’t look down on me. Although I’m not strong, Lord Chaos’s blood runs through my veins… there’s that tiny bit… After getting the First Order of Chaos, I escaped to the East.”</p>
<p>“Then where is the First Order of Chaos? Show it to me now. If it’s really useful, I can spare your life,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I can show you the First Order of Chaos, but you have to swear that you will return it to me after you see it and that you will let me leave safely.” As the siren spoke, it glanced sideways at the antelope.</p>
<p>The antelope seemed to have some interest in the First Order of Chaos that the Sea Demons mentioned. It bleated out twice as if urging the siren to take it out quickly.</p>
<p>“You don’t have the right to bargain. Show me the item. If it’s real, I can spare your life,” Zhou Wen said coldly.</p>
<p>“Alright.” The siren hesitated for a while before clenching its teeth. It reached into the clamshell and pulled it out and handed it to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked over and saw that the siren was holding a crystal ball, but it was different from an ordinary crystal ball. Within it were constantly changing light and shadows.</p>
<p>Night, day, fire, lightning, wind, clouds, sun, moon, and stars kept flashing and disappearing. As they flashed, Zhou Wen could see the characters changing into words, vanishing when the light and darkness crossed each other.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t know what those words meant. They were different from the language he had learned in the League-probably an ancient language that predated the League.</p>
<p>Although he couldn’t read it, Zhou Wen was shocked to discover that his gaze was still attracted to the words in the crystal ball. He couldn’t even look away as his body and mind changed along with the changes in the crystal ball.</p>
<p>It felt as if he had entered the world within the crystal ball, feeling his body assaulted by all kinds of things, burned by flames, and struck by lightning. He shivered in the darkness and sank into the sea.</p>
<p>It wasn’t only Zhou Wen. Even the antelope which was also staring fixedly at the crystal ball seemed to suffer from dementia.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this, the siren was delighted as a sinister smile appeared on her face. How can fools like you be able to withstand Lord Chaos’s divine powers? Without the bloodline of Lord Chaos, reading the First Order of Chaos in the chaos space is simply courting death.</p>
<p>The siren struggled to get up, hoping to kill Zhou Wen and the antelope who were entranced by the text in the crystal ball.</p>
<p>However, with the antelope’s body on her, it was like a mountain. Despite exerting all her strength, there was no way to break free.</p>
<p>Dammit, how is this antelope so strong? Although I was injured before I escaped, I shouldn’t be so weak that I can be suppressed by an Epic creature… The siren wasn’t anxious despite not being able to break free.</p>
<p>The siren knew very clearly that as long as they spent more time looking at the First Order of Chaos, they would be assimilated very quickly, and would be thrown uncontrollably into the chaos space. All she needed to do was wait patiently for the time to pass.</p>
<p>After waiting for a moment, a look of doubtful shock flashed in the siren’s eyes. Zhou Wen was clearly a Mortal stage student, which gave him an upper limit of less than a minute before he should be pulled into the chaos space and be trapped inside.</p>
<p>However, two to three minutes had already passed, and Zhou Wen was still standing there looking at the chaos space. He had no intention of walking forward.</p>
<p>This human is really strange. Thinking back to how her eyes had failed to entrance him, she couldn’t help but examine him.</p>
<p>For a Mortal stage to perform as such, she believed that he might have some treasure on him. Otherwise, it would be difficult to explain why he was able to resist her eyes and be able to look at the First Order of Chaos for so long.</p>
<p>As for that antelope, she had already determined that it was an extremely powerful existence. It was not surprising that it could persist for so long.</p>
<p>Thus, an extremely bizarre scene happened in the two-story living room of Zhou Wen’s building. An antelope was standing on a mermaid, while a human and antelope were staring intently at the crystal ball held by the mermaid.</p>
<p>Time ticked by. Half an hour later, the siren was certain that Zhou Wen must have an extremely powerful treasure when he still didn’t walk towards the crystal ball.</p>
<p>God really watches over me. Not only was I lucky to get the First Order of Chaos, but I actually have a powerful treasure to deliver itself to me. The siren was delighted and wished to immediately free herself from the antelope and search Zhou Wen’s body for the treasure.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the antelope on her back moved and slowly walked towards the crystal ball.</p>
<p>“They’re finally moving.” The siren was overjoyed. She threw the crystal ball into the air, causing it to float far away from her, making the antelope slowly walk towards it, getting off her in the process and giving her freedom.</p>
<p>She had not thrown the crystal ball at the antelope earlier because she was afraid that with it pressing down on her body, it would also pull her into the crystal ball.</p>
<p>The siren didn’t take back the crystal ball immediately to deal with the antelope but instead headed straight for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Even a powerful creature like the antelope was attracted by the words in the First Order of Chaos, walking towards it involuntarily; yet, Zhou Wen managed to be unfazed by it, affirming her belief that he had a powerful treasure on him-one not weaker than the chaos space.</p>
<p>The siren wriggled her tail impatiently and swam towards Zhou Wen, but at that moment, Zhou Wen, who was standing there like a wooden pole, suddenly moved.</p>
<p>The silver wings behind him spread out like a silver bolt of lightning and flew up into the air, lunging in the direction of the crystal ball where the chaos space was.</p>
<p>The first reaction of the siren was that Zhou Wen finally couldn’t withstand the power of the First Order of Chaos and was being attracted over to it.</p>
<p>However, she immediately dismissed such a thought. How could people who were attracted by the First Order of Chaos use Primordial Energy Skills and Companion Beasts?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was very close to the crystal ball to begin with. Therefore, with the siren’s hesitation, he managed to grab onto it with one hand.</p>
<p>“You have a death wish!” The siren didn’t panic as she looked at Zhou Wen and sneered.</p>
<p>Without a Chaos bloodline, touching the chaos space would cause one to be sucked into it and be trapped inside forever.</p>
<h3 id='chapter125'>Chapter 125 Chaos Space</h3>
<p>Even the siren with some of the Chaos’s bloodline couldn’t easily touch the chaos space at first. Only after cultivating some of the First Order of Chaos could she use her hands to touch it before fleeing to the East.</p>
<p>However, at the moment Zhou Wen grabbed the crystal ball, the expression of the siren changed.</p>
<p>When he held it, it actually retracted its brilliance and everything within it vanished. The text of the First Order of Chaos naturally vanished as well.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen play with the chaos space that had lost all its glow in his hands, the siren was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“Impossible… How is this possible… You are an Eastern creature… You can’t possibly have the blood of Lord Chaos…” The siren spoke incoherently, unable to accept the fact that Zhou Wen had control over the chaos space.</p>
<p>“Meh!” With the crystal ball controlled by Zhou Wen, the antelope immediately sobered up. It flew into a rage as it glared at the siren and let out an angry bleat.</p>
<p>The siren shuddered and turned to flee. Unfortunately, it was too late.</p>
<p>The third eye on the antelope’s forehead opened and a blinding white light shot out and hit the siren. The latter didn’t even let out a cry before it was sucked into the vertical eye of the antelope.</p>
<p>The antelope closed its vertical eye and its mood changed for the better. It had been too careless and thought that nothing would happen with its strength. Yet, it fell for the siren’s scheme and almost got sucked into the chaos space.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for Zhou Wen, it would really have perished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t notice the expression on the antelope’s face as he fiddled with the crystal ball in his hand.</p>
<p>It wasn’t very big-about the size as a billiard ball. In the beginning, Zhou Wen had indeed been affected by the First Order of Chaos.</p>
<p>Fortunately, after being influenced, the Lost Immortal Sutra slowly stopped its circulation and when it restarted, it had turned into a brand new Primordial Energy Art circulation method-naturally the First Order of Chaos.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen had already regained his clarity of mind. However, he wasn’t a match for the siren and with the crystal ball in her hands, there was no way he could snatch it away from her, much less save the antelope.</p>
<p>Without rescuing the antelope, he still wasn’t the siren’s match when she regained her freedom, so he could only wait for a chance.</p>
<p>After the siren threw out the crystal ball, Zhou Wen knew that his opportunity had arrived. He snatched the crystal ball and controlled it with the power of the First Order of Chaos Primordial Energy Art, allowing the antelope to regain its lucidity.</p>
<p>This crystal ball was indeed very strange. When Zhou Wen used the power of the First Order of Chaos to control it, he found that its interior was a huge space that could contain infinity.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t cultivated the First Order of Chaos, this crystal ball would only allow entry just like a huge prison cell that didn’t allow escape.</p>
<p>However, after cultivating the First Order of Chaos, he could control it freely. It wasn’t difficult for him to extract something from the chaos space.</p>
<p>Isn’t this equivalent to a huge storage space? With a thought, Zhou Wen injected the power of the First Order of Chaos into the crystal ball, causing it to shrink according to his will and it soon became the size of a bean. However, it didn’t shrink any further.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was naturally in a good mood after receiving such a magical crystal ball. However, although the Lost Immortal Sutra had helped him master the First Order of Chaos, it didn’t increase any of his attributes. His Strength, Constitution, and Primordial Energy were still at 11 while his Speed remained at 10.</p>
<p>He thought for a moment before carefully taking in the power of the First Order of Chaos and guessed a probable reason.</p>
<p>From what Zhou Wen sensed, the First Order of Chaos obviously had an effect on strengthening his Primordial Energy. However, his Primordial Energy attribute had already been enhanced by the Wordless Monument, so when cultivating a relatively similar First Order of Chaos, it wasn’t of much use. He just had an additional Primordial Energy Art to call his own.</p>
<p>If my theory is correct, then I have to cultivate another Primordial Energy skill that improves Speed, to raise my Speed attribute to 11 points. Zhou Wen felt a slight headache.</p>
<p>It was already very difficult to find a Primordial Energy Art, and it had to be one that focused on increasing Speed. The difficulty had increased quite significantly.</p>
<p>The information I found in the library did mention lands of mystery similar to Small Buddha Temple and Mount Laojun, but how can I confirm that the Primordial Energy Arts in that particular land of mystery will increase Speed? Zhou Wen was a little vexed.</p>
<p>Those lands of mystery weren’t in Luoyang to begin with, and now there was such a limitation. Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss where to find the Primordial Energy Arts.</p>
<p>I’ll wait until after the comprehensive test. Zhou Wen couldn’t leave the college now. So even if he had a target in mind, he wasn’t able to go.</p>
<p>The antelope sized up Zhou Wen and finally slumped back on the sofa, looking rather listless.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen returned to his room and closed the door. He then took out the crystal ball that was about the size of a soybean and attempted to put things like teacups inside before retrieving them.</p>
<p>It went very smoothly. Be it small items like teacups and spectacle boxes or bigger items like blankets or chairs, they could easily be put inside and retrieved. It was like a particular robot cat’s pocket.</p>
<p>However, after Zhou Wen mastered the complete First Order of Chaos, the mysterious light, shadows, and text in the crystal ball didn’t appear again. It lost the ability to attract other creatures to enter by themselves.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen tried putting the mysterious phone into the crystal ball, he realized that it couldn’t fit.</p>
<p>After studying it for a while, Zhou Wen put away the crystal ball and went online to search for items like jewelry or accessories.</p>
<p>In the past, all sorts of gemstones, jade, and diamonds were expensive. But now, the prices of those items were very cheap, and ordinary people could buy them.</p>
<p>Especially the price of diamonds, they weren’t much more expensive than natural crystals now.</p>
<p>Firstly, it was because diamonds weren’t worth much with artificial diamonds capable of replacing the demand for natural diamonds. Furthermore, in this era, people were more willing to spend money on Companion Eggs and dimensional crystals. This caused the price of diamonds to naturally drop drastically.</p>
<p>Now, an increasing number of high-level jewelry was made with dimensional crystals. Anyone who had a bit of money wouldn’t wear ordinary diamonds.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was trying to hide the crystal ball inside an accessory. It was easy for others to suspect a single crystal, but it was difficult to feel any problems when the crystal was surrounded by several inlaid crystals similar to it. After all, the chaos space crystal ball usually looked no different from ordinary crystals.</p>
<p>After some choosing, Zhou Wen chose a silver bracelet made of natural crystals and diamonds.</p>
<h3 id='chapter126'>Chapter 126 Bracelet</h3>
<p>As Zhou Wen had deliberately chosen a seller in the same city, the silver bracelet he had bought over the Internet was delivered the next afternoon. When he went to the school gates to get the delivery, he saw Ah Sheng driving up.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, Madam has ordered some dishes at a restaurant and wishes you to have a meal with her.” Ah Sheng was so polite that it was embarrassing to reject him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment. Since he was going to the restaurant and not the An family’s residence, there was no harm in him going.</p>
<p>The bracelet didn’t take up much space, so Zhou Wen didn’t return to the dormitory first and got into Ah Sheng’s car.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, rest for a while. It’ll take about half an hour before we reach the place,” Ah Sheng started the car and said to Zhou Wen as he drove.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you An Tianzuo’s adjutant? Why do you always work for Sister Lan?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>Ah Sheng smiled and said, “I’m the Overseer’s adjutant. Other than my usual duties, I’m also in charge of taking care of the Overseer’s life as well as the safety of the An family. You can think of me as half a butler of the An family.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded and didn’t say anything more. As half an hour was just too long, he thought for a moment and opened the accessory box and took out the silver bracelet.</p>
<p>The bracelet looked beautiful and exquisite. On it was quite a number of diamonds and crystals. Zhou Wen had only bought it after looking at the dimensions, so the size of the crystals was basically the same as the chaos space crystal ball.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully removed one of the crystals and then embedded the chaos space crystal ball. It looked perfect, and he couldn’t see any flaws.</p>
<p>With the diamonds forming a contrast, the crystal ball wasn’t eye-catching. Most people wouldn’t purposely take note of the crystals on</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>After trying it on his wrist, he found a problem. The Space Crystal Pearl was indeed inconspicuous, but wearing this bracelet on a man’s wrist seemed a little too conspicuous.</p>
<p>The silver is a little too shiny and it’s not hard enough. It breaks easily so I think I’ll buy another bracelet made of carbide later, Zhou Wen thought to himself and took the bracelet off and put it in the box.</p>
<p>The box was a little too big to permit him to put it in his pocket, so Zhou Wen could only hold it in his hand.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the restaurant, he realized that An Jing was also there.</p>
<p>“Little Wen, come over quickly. The dishes have already been ordered. We’re just waiting for you.” Ouyang Lan pulled Zhou Wen to sit beside her naturally.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen didn’t have a good impression of An Jing, he didn’t care too much about it. Since he was already here, he might as well sit down and accompany Ouyang Lan and leave after the meal.</p>
<p>An Jing sat on the other side of Ouyang Lan. She glanced at Zhou Wen but didn’t say a word. She had an arrogant and cold expression.</p>
<p>Ah Sheng had already ordered the staff to serve the dishes. Before they were served, Ouyang Lan saw the box in Zhou Wen’s hand and asked, “Little Wen, what are you carrying?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, It’s not a bad idea to let Ouyang Lan take a look too. If she doesn’t notice anything, it would be even harder for others to notice anything amiss.</p>
<p>“I bought a bracelet. Sister Lan, take a look.” Zhou Wen handed the box over to Ouyang Lan.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan took the box and opened it to take a look. It was a silver bracelet worn by a lady. Although it was not an expensive item, its design was quite unique.</p>
<p>“Little Wen, I didn’t expect you to be so thoughtful. Is this a birthday present for Little Jing? I didn’t plan on telling you that it’s her birthday today and just wanted to invite you to a meal. I never expected you to get her a gift.” Ouyang Lan really imagined that Zhou Wen had bought a present.</p>
<p>If not, why would a man like him bring a female bracelet here?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was stunned when he heard that. He didn’t know that he had bought a female bracelet since he only bought it because the dimensions for embedding the chaos space crystal ball was perfect.</p>
<p>If Ouyang Lan hadn’t told him, he wouldn’t have known that this was a female bracelet.</p>
<p>An Jing also thought that Zhou Wen had really bought this bracelet for her. She felt a little ashamed in her heart. Zhou Wen is quite a nice person. I went a little overboard in the past. Should I find a chance to apologize?</p>
<p>Just as An Jing was thinking about this, she suddenly heard Zhou Wen say, “Sis Lan, I didn’t know it was An Jing’s birthday today. This isn’t a gift for her.”</p>
<p>An Jing’s expression froze. For a moment, she had mixed, conflicted feelings.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan hurriedly changed the topic and said, “You bought such a pretty bracelet. Is there a girl you like?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head and said, “I bought the wrong item. I bought a male bracelet myself and ended up buying a female one. I’ll have to return it later.”</p>
<p>This little rascal, he’s like an impervious rock. Zhou Lingfeng is so good at reading people, so how did he give birth to such a brat? Ouyang Lan felt a little despondent hearing Zhou Wen’s words. Since you bought the wrong item and have no intention of giving it to someone else, can’t you just give it to An Jing? It’s not like a bracelet costs much.</p>
<p>How could Ouyang Lan know that there was a chaos space crystal ball embedded in the bracelet? How could Zhou Wen give it to An Jing?</p>
<p>This meal was very awkward. Ouyang Lan didn’t have a solution either. After quickly finishing the meal, she got Ah Sheng to take Zhou Wen back first.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen returned to the dormitory, he immediately ordered another bracelet online. This time, Zhou Wen was more careful and confirmed that it was a male bracelet. He even specially chose a carbide bracelet.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen received the new bracelet, he embedded the chaos space crystal ball into it and found it very suitable. Even if he looked closely, it was difficult to distinguish the chaos space crystal bead from the diamonds and natural crystals.</p>
<p>Moreover, most people wouldn’t be able to see him wearing a bracelet with his sleeves usually covering it.</p>
<p>After much effort, Zhou Wen finally managed to settle the bracelet. The date for the comprehensive test was already nearing.</p>
<p>He had not seen Li Xuan for days, perhaps a result of him working hard to improve his strength. He had the Li family backing him, so he had endless numbers of dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs. Raising his stats and contracting powerful Legendary Companion Beasts wasn’t a difficult task. It was expected that his strength would soar extremely quickly.</p>
<p>Only on the day of the comprehensive test did Zhou Wen realize how many students Sunset College had. The dense horde of people probably numbered more than ten thousand.</p>
<p>There were four special zones on the field. In one area, there were about a hundred pots with scorching hot oil. Blue smoke emitted from them as though it would ignite at any moment.</p>
<p>In another zone, there was a hundred-meter-long bridge made with thirty-centimeter-wide calligraphic paper. It was probably the testing venue for crossing the paper bridge.</p>
<p>The other two testing venues were quite far from Zhou Wen, he could only see a few stone tripod cauldrons and nothing else.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, how were your preparations? Are you confident of entering the top ten?” Li Xuan came to Zhou Wen’s side and threw his arm around his shoulder.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Li Xuan’s words, one of the group of female seniors beside them said with a laugh, “Juniors, you guys are really amusing. You want to get into the top ten as freshmen? Nice dreams and aspirations. Here’s me wishing you all the best as a senior.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter127'>Chapter 127 Comprehensive Test</h3>
<p>“Seniors, since you think so highly of us, why don’t we be friends? We should work on our communication for pure friendship at school…” Li Xuan used this opportunity to chat with the seniors as he walked over.</p>
<p>Just as they were happily chatting and Li Xuan was about to take a step further, they suddenly heard a commotion from the students. It was as though many female seniors were talking about a particular Brother Wei[1].</p>
<p>“Ah! Brother Wei… Brother Wei…” The female seniors who had been conversing with Li Xuan suddenly ignored him and began waving their hands in a different direction.</p>
<p>“F*ck, when did Sunset College become so liberal?” Li Xuan was puzzled as he turned his head to look in the direction where the female seniors were waving their hands. He saw a boy walking towards the stage to speak on behalf of the students.</p>
<p>When he saw the boy’s appearance, Li Xuan said with a tinge of jealousy, “So what if you’re president of the student council? You’re only two years ahead of us. I’ll be running for student council president later. I’ll also be president.”</p>
<p>“Is he very strong?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Not bad I guess. The student council president of Sunset College usually has the strength to squeeze into the school’s top three. Before we arrived, this Wei Ge was considered the second strongest in the college. His Life Providence was about being all-rounded in both academics and martial arts. He is extremely fast at learning and mastering things when others need to spend a lot of time practicing. From martial arts and weapons to theoretical knowledge, he has never gotten second place after entering Sunset College.”</p>
<p>“Since he has never gotten second, why do you call him the second strongest?” Zhou Wen asked, perplexed.</p>
<p>Li Xuan chuckled and said, “He hasn’t been second before, but he has been beaten up badly by someone. However, that person was the weirdo, Huang Ji. Now, the situation is different. The two of us are here in Sunset College, so he can only be fourth in the future.”</p>
<p>After Wei Ge delivered his speech, he did a demonstration for all the students in the four tests, mainly to teach the freshmen how the test was to be held.</p>
<p>In the coin fishing in oil pots, there were a total of 100 pots with boiling oil inside. However, the 100 pots were split into ten groups. Each group had 10 oil pots, and the further back the oil pots were, the higher the temperature.</p>
<p>Normally, if one could pull out a coin from the pot with the lowest temperature, it would be considered a pass.</p>
<p>“This test is very dangerous. Before choosing it, you must consider it carefully. Even if you have decided to participate in it, please start with the oil pot with the lowest temperature,” said Wei Ge as he summoned a Companion Beast-a black-furred gorilla.</p>
<p>“This is a Blackiron Gorilla at the Mortal stage. Its Constitution is at about 9 points, so it’s considered top-notch among the Mortal stage.” With that said, Wei Ge ordered the Blackiron Gorilla to fish out the coin from the first oil pot. However, just as its claws reached into the pot, it screamed.</p>
<p>The Blackiron Gorilla screamed as it retracted its claw, but the fur on it had already blistered. It looked very scary, and there was even a faint meat fragrance.</p>
<p>Everyone’s heart skipped a beat when they saw this. Those students who were originally hoping to try their luck immediately gave up on the idea of choosing this test.</p>
<p>“I believe everyone has seen it. You must be careful when choosing this option. Next, I will demonstrate it for everyone.” Wei Ge smiled as he rolled up his sleeve. A red tattoo appeared on his smooth arm-a red-scaled snake.</p>
<p>Following Wei Ge’s summoning, the red-scaled snake tattoo on his arm seemed to come alive. It transformed into a red-scaled bracer that wrapped his entire arm and palm. Then, Wei Ge extended his hand into the oil pot and took out a coin as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Following that, Wei Ge demonstrated the remaining three options, but he only did it for the lowest difficulty, mainly to let the freshmen know how the options were tested.</p>
<p>Out of the four options, only crossing the paper bridge did not have any ranking. All the paper bridges were 100 meters long, and the results were determined by the time it took for one to cross. Tearing the calligraphic paper meant zero points.</p>
<p>Besides, one was not allowed to use flying Companion Beasts when crossing the paper bridge and had to walk on paper. Therefore, this was a huge obstacle for many students.</p>
<p>After Wei Ge’s demonstration, the students started signing up for the options they were participating in. Each of them had to declare at least two, and of course, they could select all four.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan declared that they were taking all four options as they wanted to enter the top ten. Therefore, not only did they need to complete the four options, but they also had to obtain good results.</p>
<p>These four options didn’t seem easy to Zhou Wen. It wasn’t difficult to pass, but it wasn’t easy to obtain a high score.</p>
<p>However, the first student who went up on stage chose to fish the coin from the oil pot. Furthermore, he walked straight to the hottest pot in the row of ten. He casually stood in front of the pot and rolled up his sleeve. He did not use a Companion Beast, but his arm had a metallic sheen. It was unknown what Primordial Energy Skill he used as he extended his hand into the pot and pulled out a coin.</p>
<p>“That guy’s name is Wu Jun. He also has a younger sister named Wu Nan. It’s very difficult to see the siblings in action. However, they have unfathomable strength,” Li Xuan told Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Wu Jun’s performance gave many of the students who had been frightened earlier, hope. In the end, a freshman chose to fish the coin, believing that his Primordial Energy Skill could help him pass. However, just the lowest temperature pot scalded his hand. Luckily, there were doctors present to provide him emergency treatment.</p>
<p>After Wei Ge’s demonstration, he watched from the side. When he saw Feng Qiuyan choose to cross the paper bridge and obtain excellent results, breaking the previous record, he came to Feng Qiuyan’s side with a smile.</p>
<p>“Feng Qiuyan, I’ve heard so much about you. Are you interested in joining the student council?” Wei Ge asked with a smile.</p>
<p>The students beside them looked at Feng Qiuyan with envy. Those who could join the student council were all the college’s top students. Normally, they would have to apply to join. Yet, the student council president, Wei Ge, personally invited him. To the typical student, it was a great honor.</p>
<p>“Not interested,” Feng Qiuyan replied expressionlessly as he walked past Wei Ge.</p>
<p>Wei Ge only smiled. Those who were capable all had some character. He could understand that, but at the same time, he firmly believed that it was only a matter of time before Feng Qiuyan joined the student council.</p>
<p>He turned to look at Feng Qiuyan and realized that he was actually walking towards Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Wei Ge naturally recognized Li Xuan, a famous scion from Luoyang City. He couldn’t help but be surprised that with Feng Qiuyan’s temper, he would actually have ties with Li Xuan. It was truly unbelievable.</p>
<p>However, Wei Ge soon discovered that Feng Qiuyan was not looking for Li Xuan, but the boy standing beside him.</p>
<p>[1] The name of Viagra in Chinese.</p>
<h3 id='chapter128'>Chapter 128 The Rejected Wei Ge</h3>
<p>With a careful look, Wei Ge recognized Zhou Wen. As the president of the student council, he paid attention to the top freshmen.</p>
<p>Wei Ge had already carefully studied Zhou Wen and Li Xuan’s battle of the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus, as well as the video of him slaying the word-engraved Demonized General.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s performance was indeed good, but it also exposed some problems. Therefore, Wei Ge had only placed Zhou Wen on a list of possible nominees as student council members. As for whether he would invite him to join in the future, it also depended on what Life Providence he obtained after he advanced to the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was talking to Zhou Wen when he saw Feng Qiuyan walking over. He found it odd, but ended up seeing Feng Qiuyan walk straight towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat when he saw Feng Qiuyan. Could it be that Feng Qiuyan found out that I was just being perfunctory with him and came to settle scores with me?</p>
<p>“Coach, when’s the next class?” Feng Qiuyan asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Wait, coach? What’s happening?” Li Xuan widened his eyes as he looked at Feng Qiuyan and Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Feng Qiuyan’s words, Zhou Wen’s hanging heart eased. He said to Feng Qiuyan, “First, master what I said previously. We’ll talk about the rest later.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Feng Qiuyan agreed and sat down beside him.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, what’s going on?” Li Xuan felt like a cat was clawing at his curiosity. He really couldn’t understand why Feng Qiuyan was acquainted with Zhou Wen and addressed him as coach.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. It’s just that Feng Qiuyan invited me to be his personal coach and tailor a training plan for him,” Zhou Wen said casually.</p>
<p>After Li Xuan heard this, the way he looked at Zhou Wen became even odder. With Feng Qiuyan by his side, it wasn’t appropriate for him to say anything. However, he thought to himself, What the hell. Feng Qiuyan can hire any coach. It’s not difficult even finding an Epic expert as a personal coach for him. Why would he find a student from the same school? Furthermore, Zhou Wen hasn’t even advanced to the Legendary stage. Is Feng Qiuyan bonkers to hire him as a coach?</p>
<p>Li Xuan sat there uneasily, eager to know what had happened between Zhou Wen and Feng Qiuyan; however, it wasn’t the best place to ask him.</p>
<p>When Wei Ge saw Feng Qiuyan sitting beside Zhou Wen, he was somewhat surprised, but he didn’t think too much about it.</p>
<p>Seeing that Wang Lu had finally appeared on the field and had just registered for the tests she was taking, Wei Ge hurriedly went up to her and smiled like a gentleman. “Wang Lu, I’m the student council president, Wei Ge. I wish to invite you to join the student council…”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I don’t plan on joining any club.” Wang Lu politely rejected Wei Ge before walking towards Zhou Wen as well.</p>
<p>Wei Ge was not surprised that Wang Lu had rejected him, because her family background was obvious. Others might think highly of the student council’s connections and influence, but Wang Lu had no need for it.</p>
<p>However, when Wei Ge saw that Wang Lu had actually walked over to Zhou Wen and exchanged a few words with him before sitting down beside him, he couldn’t help but be alarmed.</p>
<p>When Wei Ge saw An Jing, he didn’t mention the invitation to her. He just went up to greet her to acquaint himself with her.</p>
<p>Sunset College was originally under the An family, so if she were to join the student council, she would definitely become president. When that happened, he would have to step down to the rank of vice president, so Wei Ge naturally wouldn’t do such a stupid thing</p>
<p>Fortunately, after all this time, An Jing hadn’t shown any intention of joining the student council. This relaxed Wei Ge a lot more.</p>
<p>An Jing nodded politely as a response to Wei Ge before walking towards Zhou Wen again.</p>
<p>What the hell is wrong with that punk? He’s only been in Sunset College for a month, yet he already has such connections? Wei Ge was secretly alarmed as he couldn’t help but think more highly of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>An Jing came in front of Zhou Wen. She looked at him and said, “If you can get into the top 100 at the comprehensive test, I’ll count you as winning the bet.”</p>
<p>With that, she walked away.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback before recalling the three-month declaration An Jing had made with him. However, he hadn’t taken it to heart. So if she hadn’t mentioned it at that moment, he would have already forgotten it.</p>
<p>“What bet?” Li Xuan probed, his eagerness for gossip rearing its head.</p>
<p>“Nothing.” Zhou Wen shook his head without saying a word.</p>
<p>Wei Ge sized up Zhou Wen from a distance, wondering how he could pull him onto the student council. Since Zhou Wen had such connections, it would be of great help to the student council’s future development if he could get him on the student council.</p>
<p>Wei Ge could also use Zhou Wen’s connections, perhaps to break into Wang Lu’s and An Jing’s circle.</p>
<p>As he was thinking, he saw Huang Ji walking over from the front. Wei Ge immediately changed directions, unwilling to meet Huang Ji.</p>
<p>In this school, the person he hated the most and also didn’t dare provoke the most was Huang Ji. In the past, he had wanted to rope Huang Ji onto the student council but had been rejected. Later, he used some tricks, only to realize that Huang Ji was much more powerful than he had imagined. This ended up in him being beaten up.</p>
<p>The school knew that Huang Ji had beaten him up, but they did not know why.</p>
<p>Ever since that time, Wei Ge would circle around Huang Ji when he saw him. He had stopped thinking of roping Huang Ji onto the student council again. Moreover, he did not think that anyone had such a pull with Huang Ji.</p>
<p>After Wei Ge circled around Huang Ji and looked back, he saw Zhou Wen stand up and wave at Huang Ji, as though he was beckoning for him to head over.</p>
<p>By then, Huang Ji had already taken a seat. With Wei Ge’s understanding of him, he believed that Huang Ji definitely wouldn’t bother with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, Huang Ji actually got up and walked over after hearing Zhou Wen calling out to him. When he arrived beside Zhou Wen, he began chatting very warmly with him.</p>
<p>Wei Ge was dumbfounded. What’s going on? That weirdo Huang Ji can actually chat with someone for so long?</p>
<p>He had no idea that the reason Huang Ji was chatting with Zhou Wen for so long was that Zhou Wen was talking about his game and investment. That was why Huang Ji was so interested.</p>
<p>This first-year freshman, Zhou Wen, needs serious observation. Wei Ge felt that it was necessary to reassess Zhou Wen again. If possible, he had to rope him onto the student council and be under his service.</p>
<p>Not long after, Wei Ge saw Hui Haifeng and Nana walk over to Zhou Wen’s side with a few high-ranking students. They seemed to be having a great chat with Zhou Wen and company, and his heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>By right, since he was the student council president, there shouldn’t be anyone in Sunset College who could compete with him. However, Hui Haifeng was an exception.</p>
<p>If Wei Ge was a classic model student at Sunset College, Hui Haifeng was a typical bad role model. Most of the students around him were people who didn’t abide by the rules.</p>
<h3 id='chapter129'>Chapter 129 Perfect Score</h3>
<p>Sunset College is indeed one of the best schools in the East District. There are just too many formidable people around. Li Xuan couldn’t help but feel nervous when he saw someone raise the heaviest stone tripod cauldron.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had roughly guessed that based on the present situation, the two of them had to obtain perfect scores on at least two tests before they could enter the top ten.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng and Feng Qiuyan had already passed the test, each scoring full marks on three and nine points on the fourth. Hui Haifeng was one point short of crossing the paper bridge and Feng Qiuyan was one point short in the coin fishing test.</p>
<p>As Li Xuan expected, Wang Lu had indeed advanced to the Legendary stage. Like An Jing, she had obtained 4 perfect scores very easily.</p>
<p>Huang Ji hadn’t taken the test, but considering how he had beaten up Wei Ge previously, Zhou Wen knew that it was highly likely that Huang Ji would receive four perfect scores as well.</p>
<p>There were already five people in the top ten. In addition, there were Wu Jun and Wu Nan who had outstanding performances, leaving three spots left.</p>
<p>na</p>
<p>“That’s not right. There are only two slots left. That Wei Ge will definitely score four perfect scores,” warned Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“In that case, we need to obtain four perfect scores to safely enter the top ten,” Zhou Wen pondered for a moment before saying and basically giving up.</p>
<p>After all, he had yet to advance to the Legendary stage. He could only rely on his Companion Beasts, so it was very difficult for him to score high.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng, Wang Lu, and company looked at Zhou Wen and Li Xuan with smiles. They had already received their results, so they were all waiting to see the duo’s performance.</p>
<p>“We have to give it a try no matter what,” Li Xuan said through clenched teeth. The situation was worse than he had expected.</p>
<p>When the staff called out Zhou Wen’s name, he had no choice but to head to the venue with oil pots to fish out a coin. Just as he was about to register with the staff and head on up, he was stopped by someone.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, mind if we have a chat?” Wei Ge said with a smile.</p>
<p>“How may I help you?” Zhou Wen stopped and asked Wei Ge.</p>
<p>“Let the other students take the test first. Let’s have a chat at the side.” Wei Ge led Zhou Wen to a quiet spot.</p>
<p>“Feel free to speak your mind,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you haven’t advanced to the Legendary stage yet, right? Are you confident of getting into the top ten?” Wei Ge said when he saw Zhou Wen looking at him suspiciously. “Don’t misunderstand me. I don’t have any other intentions. I just feel that you are a talent. It’ll be a pity if you can’t get into the top ten because of your stage.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen looked at Wei Ge in puzzlement, unsure what he was getting at.</p>
<p>“The student council still has an empty spot for vice president. I admire you very much and wish to recommend you to be the vice president of the student council.” Wei Ge paused for a moment before smiling and saying, “As a member of the student council, I will naturally do my best to help you. Perhaps it will help you enter the top 10 in the comprehensive test.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your kind intentions. However, I’ve already made an agreement with Li Xuan to organize a club on my own,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Sunset College had a clear rule that students who had already joined a club could not become members of the student council. This was to prevent some clubs from using the power of the student council to seek personal gains.</p>
<p>“Is that so? That’s such a pity. The doors of the student council will always be open to you. If you ever change your mind, hit me up anytime.” Wei Ge looked saddened but did not say anything else.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen went to the staff to register before heading to the first test venue— fishing a coin from a pot of boiling oil.</p>
<p>“President, will Zhou Wen become the second Hui Haifeng?” a student council member standing beside Wei Ge whispered.</p>
<p>Wei Ge didn’t answer him. He thought for a moment and asked, “Were you in charge of setting up the venue?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it was all set up by our student council. Didn’t you arrange for it?” Zheng Tianlun was puzzled.</p>
<p>“I didn’t arrange for you to tamper with it, right?” Wei Ge narrowed his eyes at Zheng Tianlun.</p>
<p>Zheng Tianlun’s forehead immediately broke out into a cold sweat. He forced a smile and said, “As expected, I can’t hide anything from you, President. I was just trying to help some friends out. I wasn’t trying anything else since all they wanted was a pass.”</p>
<p>Wei Ge said indifferently, “You don’t have to worry. I didn’t say anything before, and I won’t say anything now, but I need your help with something.”</p>
<p>“If there’s anything, President, please instruct us. We will definitely do it well,” Zheng Tianlun hurriedly said.</p>
<p>“The difficulty of Zhou Wen’s options should be lowered. The lower the level, the better. It’s best if he gets 4 perfect scores,” commented Wei Ge.</p>
<p>Zheng Tianlun asked with a puzzled look, “President, that Zhou Wen has already rejected you. Why are you still helping him?”</p>
<p>“Rejection doesn’t make him an enemy. This person isn’t simple. There’s no harm in doing him a favor.” Wei Ge smiled at Zhou Wen when he said that. He didn’t say certain things.</p>
<p>If he were to become an enemy in the future, this matter might become a skeleton in the closet for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Cheating was a serious matter at Sunset College. The punishment ranged from having a black mark on their records to being expelled.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll do it now. However, all we can do is adjust it within a certain range. If it’s at the Mortal stage, I’m afraid it will be difficult for him to get a perfect score,” Zheng Tianlun said after some thought.</p>
<p>“Just do what needs to be done. Remember, I don’t know anything,” Wei Ge said.</p>
<p>“I got it, President. Don’t worry, this has nothing to do with you at all,” Zheng Tianlun said hurriedly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen came to the oil pot and was rather cautious. He began with the pot that had the lowest temperature.</p>
<p>“How many points do you think Zhou Wen will get?” Li Xuan asked Hui Haifeng.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng shook his head and said, “It’s hard to say. Normally, without advancing to the Legendary stage, he won’t have any Legendary Companion Beasts or Primordial Energy Skills. Fishing out a coin from the fifth pot is already quite impressive. However, Zhou Wen is somewhat abnormal. He might have some unexpected results.”</p>
<p>“It’s about the same as I expected. With his abilities, I think he should be able to obtain around seven points. It will be a little difficult to get any higher.” Li Xuan knew Zhou Wen quite well.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen had roughly estimated getting such a score. Although the Lotus Flower Buddha Body could protect him, it was a Primordial Energy Skill that augmented his entire body. It was inferior to Primordial Energy Skills that specialized in augmenting one’s arm.</p>
<p>Furthermore, his Constitution wasn’t comparable to those at the Legendary stage. The latter might not even be able to obtain ten points, so Zhou Wen estimated that he would get about seven or eight.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen tried the oil pots one by one, he realized that the temperature of the pot wasn’t as high as he imagined. He had managed to successfully take out a coin from the final pot and obtained full marks without any surprises.</p>
<p>Although it was thanks to the lotus flower bracer, Zhou Wen still felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>What? Looks like the test isn’t that difficult. Li Xuan heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Zhou Wen easily obtain a perfect score.</p>
<p>He was just after Zhou Wen in fishing out the coin. Seeing how Zhou Wen had easily scored a perfect ten, he didn’t bother wasting any more time as he directly headed straight for the tenth pot.</p>
<p>To Li Xuan’s surprise, when he extended his hand into the pot, believing that his Immortal God of Combat Life Providence and Invincible Connate Divine Art could protect him, he let out a loud cry. He hurriedly pulled out his hand only to see his skin scalded red.</p>
<h3 id='chapter130'>Chapter 130 Peerless Genius?</h3>
<p>Impossible! How can Zhou Wen fish out a coin, while I can’t? Li Xuan’s expression was one of disbelief.</p>
<p>However, the results of this option were set in stone. Li Xuan couldn’t even fish out a single coin, putting his result at zero. Even if he received a perfect score on the other three options, there was no way he could squeeze into the top ten.</p>
<p>Li Xuan felt a sense of regret. If he hadn’t been careless and bore with it, he could have taken out the coin. After all, with the Immortal God of War Life Providence, his hand wouldn’t be crippled.</p>
<p>One false step will lead to everlasting grief! Li Xuan nearly cried.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen successfully passed the subsequent tests. Other than crossing the paper bridge at a slower speed, he obtained a perfect score on the other three options.</p>
<p>Instantly, the entire school broke out into a flurry of discussion. People were trying to find out more about Zhou Wen. A freshman at the Mortal stage had actually received three 10s and one 9. They were basically certain that he could enter the top ten. The results were really shocking</p>
<p>Although Wang Lu, An Jing, and Feng Qiuyan were freshmen, they had already advanced to the Legendary stage. It was understandable for them to have such results. It was shocking for Zhou Wen, who was at the Mortal stage, to obtain such results.</p>
<p>Instantly, the reputation of the peerless genius Zhou Wen spread throughout the school, but there were also teachers who had their doubts.</p>
<p>They had seen their fair share of geniuses, but none of them could achieve such results at the Mortal stage.</p>
<p>The person who had the greatest suspicions was Wang Fei. She had wanted Zhou Wen to be stirred up by the comprehensive test and see if he could pull himself together, but to her surprise, Zhou Wen had managed to enter the top ten and even obtained the qualifications to enter Providence Palace. She thought this was unacceptable.</p>
<p>However, all the tests were carried out in front of everyone. Zhou Wen wasn’t the first or the last one. People before and after him used the same equipment, so there wasn’t any evidence to explain it away with cheating.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t make sense… This doesn’t make sense… Why did I only get three 9S… Yet, you obtained three 10s and a 9…” Li Xuan really couldn’t accept this outcome.</p>
<p>In fact, Li Xuan wasn’t the only one who couldn’t accept it. Zhou Wen also knew that his results were absolutely problematic. On the Strength test, Zhou Wen knew very well that he couldn’t lift the tenth stone tripod cauldron; yet, he had managed to raise it in the end. Furthermore, he felt that the tenth stone tripod wasn’t any heavier than the ninth. It was impossible that there wasn’t something fishy about it.</p>
<p>How could Zhou Wen know that electromagnetic devices were installed at the bottom of the stone cauldron and the platform beneath them? Zheng Tianlun could control the power needed to lift the stone cauldron to a certain extent.</p>
<p>The other tests had also been tampered with. However, they were done in an extremely unnoticeable fashion. Even the teachers did not know that the venue had already been tampered with during the setup.</p>
<p>After the comprehensive test ended, the venue was dismantled, so no one would realize anything</p>
<p>All of this was something Zheng Tianlun had actually prepared for himself, hoping to use these methods to enter the top ten, but after he was exposed by Wei Ge, he didn’t dare continue with the tampering. This ended up benefiting Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>This resulted in Zhou Wen inexplicably gaining the reputation of a genius. When Wei Ge specially came to congratulate him, he even winked at him, making Zhou Wen, who had originally suspected Wei Ge, confirm his theory.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was Wei Ge who tampered with it. But why did he do that? Is it to rope in a freshman to join the student council? Zhou Wen was perplexed.</p>
<p>Regardless, Zhou Wen was famous in Sunset College. Since its establishment over the years, no Mortal-stage student had such results.</p>
<p>As expected of Coach. Feng Qiuyan had zero doubts, believing that it was all Zhou Wen’s true strength, so his determination at getting him to be his personal coach became firmer.</p>
<p>Although there were people who had their doubts, they could only keep quiet because of a lack of evidence.</p>
<p>Finally, the top ten spots were confirmed. Without any surprises, Zhou Wen successfully entered the top ten and obtained the qualification to enter Providence Palace.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, I really can’t accept it. Other things aside, your Strength definitely isn’t as great as mine. It doesn’t make sense that you could lift the tenth stone tripod cauldron, but I couldn’t.” Li Xuan’s face was filled with resentment.</p>
<p>“That’s life for you.” What else could Zhou Wen say?</p>
<p>Thankfully, Li Xuan wasn’t really bothered by the spot. All he did was gripe at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I’m not bragging, but Zhou Wen is a genius amongst geniuses. Back when we were in Guide High School, everyone in our school knew that Zhou Wen was a genius. You know Ascetic Meditation, right? With how difficult it is to cultivate, the typical person won’t even gain a basic mastery in Primordial Energy without a couple of years, even if they have Primordial Energy Crystals. Yet, Zhou Wen forcibly mastered it without using a single Primordial Energy Crystal…” Tian Xiangdong’s saliva splattered as he described anecdotes of Zhou Wen’s past during high school to other students.</p>
<p>Without Zhou Wen even realizing it, he had become an iconic figure amongst Sunset College’s freshmen and was regarded as the most promising freshman in Sunset College.</p>
<p>Although this wasn’t the outcome Zhou Wen wished to see, obtaining the qualifications to enter Providence Palace was a pleasant surprise for him.</p>
<p>The second day after the comprehensive test ended was the day Zhou Wen and the other nine students entered Providence Palace. All of them received a token given by the school, and under the leadership of a counselor, they arrived at the legendary Providence Palace.</p>
<p>Providence Palace was more magnificent than the Forbidden City. After becoming a dimensional zone, it gave people the feeling that it was magnificent and majestic. Although it was underground, it did not hinder Zhou Wen and the other students from marveling at the greatness of the ancient culture.</p>
<p>Outside the entrance, Zhou Wen and company were waiting for it to open. Wang Lu looked around curiously. “This place is about a thousand meters deep and is surrounded by rocks. Where did those legendary treasures come from?”</p>
<p>“Other dimensions, obviously. Do you really think there are ghosts?” Hui Haifeng said with a smile.</p>
<p>It wasn’t Wei Ge’s first time here, so he explained, “Those treasures float out of the dimensional rifts before flying into Providence Palace. There is no lack of precious, rare treasures. However, the typical rare treasures are only collectibles that can only be exchanged for money. The truly precious ones are the Companion Eggs and dimensional crystals. Among them are things that the East District doesn’t have. If you are lucky enough, you might obtain a Companion Egg like an elf or an angel. They are pretty good selections.”</p>
<p>“How does one know what type of Companion Eggs they are?” asked Wang Lu curiously.</p>
<p>“I really do not know. Let’s not talk about identifying Companion Eggs, it’s hard to even choose one,” said Wei Ge.</p>
<p>“Why?” Wang Lu was a little confused.</p>
<p>“Because all the treasures are in boxes. All we can see are those boxes. We don’t even know what’s inside. Once the box is chosen, we won’t be able to change it. Therefore, we can only rely on luck to choose something,” Hui Haifeng explained.</p>
<h3 id='chapter131'>Chapter 131 Treasure Selection</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen had been searching for the tiny palm symbol the entire time, but he hadn’t found it. He had scrutinized the building that housed the city gates countless times, but he had failed to find it.</p>
<p>However, other than the entrance, there were only city walls with no sign of the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>Is the tiny palm symbol in Providence Palace? Zhou Wen looked at the tightly shut door of Providence Palace and thought, If it were really in Providence Palace, that would be troublesome. Every year, the Providence Palace only opens its gates once a day. However, the counselors have repeatedly exhorted us not to enter. In the past, there were experts at the Epic stage who had entered the Providence Palace on this day without being able to exit. Furthermore, I’m only at the Mortal stage.</p>
<p>Just as he was feeling disappointed, he suddenly heard the melodious and solemn music from within Providence Palace.</p>
<p>Accompanied by the music, it was as if the city gates, that had been sealed shut for centuries, were slowly opening. The city gate was filled with a brilliant purple glow, so blinding that it was hard for anyone to look straight at it.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen and company could see what stood beyond the city gates, the underground space suddenly emitted a blinding light that resembled holy light from the spatial rifts.</p>
<p>Then, they saw an inconceivable sight. They saw large and small boxes flying out from the spatial rifts.</p>
<p>There were exquisite wooden boxes, boxes filled with antiquity, and green and snow-white jade boxes. There were also large metal chests.</p>
<p>There were also gold and silver boxes with gems embedded in them. They looked dazzling and exquisite. The girls stared at them, almost entranced.</p>
<p>There were many gift boxes. In just a moment, more than a thousand boxes flew towards the entrance in a line. Just like the legends said, there seemed to be invisible ghosts dragging them into the entrance.</p>
<p>“There are so many boxes. How should I choose one?” Feng Qiuyan frowned.</p>
<p>“You can only rely on luck. There’s no other way.” Hui Haifeng took a large stride towards a golden box with all sorts of gems embedded in it. He took out his token and lightly tapped the small golden box with the token. The small golden box stopped floating in midair having lost its support as it fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng immediately reached out and held onto the small golden box, then returned. He was very decisive.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the gift boxes that numbered more than ten thousand. He really didn’t know which one to choose from. At that moment, Wang Lu said to Zhou Wen, “My luck has always been good. If you need it, I can help you choose one.”</p>
<p>When Wang Lu said this, she was brimming with confidence. It was as if she would definitely be able to choose something good.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll leave it to you then.” Zhou Wen was extremely disappointed having failed at finding the tiny palm symbol. Choosing a box held little meaning for him.</p>
<p>If he couldn’t download the Providence Palace dungeon, the probability of choosing a gift box with a Companion Egg in it was just too low.</p>
<p>To be able to choose a gift box with a high-level Companion Egg was even more difficult.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen never had luck with gambling, so it didn’t matter whether he chose it or not. He couldn’t be bothered to waste his time and energy and casually threw the token to Wang Lu.</p>
<p>Even if he had to choose it himself, he could only randomly pick one. It was no different from letting Wang Lu choose one. He might as well save some time to see if he could find the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>“Anyone else need my help?” Wang Lu looked at the others and asked.</p>
<p>“Since we are already here, it’s all down to luck anyway. It’s better to choose one yourself,” Wei Ge said with a smile.</p>
<p>The others obviously liked to hold their own fate in their hands, so no one planned on letting Wang Lu choose for them.</p>
<p>Other than Hui Haifeng who had already made his selection, the others began to observe the boxes, hoping that they could find some clues.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also observing, but he was looking into Providence Palace to see if he could find the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was filled with a screen of resplendent divine light. All he could see was gift boxes flying in, but he couldn’t see what was on the inside.</p>
<p>However, Wang Lu had no intention of seriously choosing. She treated the two tokens as darts and threw them into the row of boxes.</p>
<p>With two clangs, two boxes were knocked to the ground by her random throw.</p>
<p>Wang Lu grinned as she ran over and carried the two gift boxes back, handing one to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The gift box was carved out of wood. It was about thirty centimeters wide on all sides, and there were cloud patterns engraved on it. Other than that, there was nothing else.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to see what was inside. After receiving the box, he stuffed it into his bag and continued gazing into the palace.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to open it?” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. It doesn’t matter what it is,” Zhou Wen said casually.</p>
<p>Wang Lu was a little displeased that Zhou Wen didn’t care about it. Seeing that everyone was choosing their boxes and that no one was paying any attention to them, she said to Zhou Wen, “Don’t think that I just randomly chose it. My luck is really good. The items I inside will definitely be good.”</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you,” Zhou Wen said perfunctorily.</p>
<p>Wang Lu was incensed when she saw Zhou Wen’s perfunctory manner. She glared at him hatefully, but Zhou Wen had been observing the situation inside Providence Palace the entire time without giving her a second glance.</p>
<p>“If I knew this would happen, I wouldn’t have helped you choose.” Wang Lu pouted and resentfully retreated to the side. She didn’t even have the mood to open her gift box to see what was inside.</p>
<p>Even after they had all made their choices, one after another, and the counselors had led them out of Providence Palace, Zhou Wen still hadn’t found the tiny palm symbol. He was extremely disappointed.</p>
<p>None of them had the intention to open their gift boxes on the spot. Zhou Wen also took the box that Wang Lu had chosen for him back to his dorm.</p>
<p>I wonder what it is? Zhou Wen opened it up.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was the same as he imagined. There were no Companion Eggs or dimensional crystals inside, but a strange old bronze flask.</p>
<p>It can’t be a chamber pot, right? Zhou Wen looked at the bronze flask inside the box, and it looked like one, no matter how he looked at it.</p>
<p>But from the looks of it, it seemed to be a little too small. It was probably not suited for adults.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the style looked more exquisite and it had smooth curves as if it did not match the style of the East District’s ancient style.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen switched on his ordinary phone and checked the Internet. Soon, he learned what it was. It was a hand-held oil lamp from ancient Arabia.</p>
<p>From the looks of the oil lamp, it should be an antique. I wonder how much I can sell it for? Zhou Wen muttered to himself as he took out the bronze lamp and wiped the dust he saw on it with a piece of tissue paper.</p>
<p>After a few strokes, the bronze lamp suddenly trembled, and the patterns on it began to glow strangely.</p>
<h3 id='chapter132'>Chapter 132 No Acquaintances with Immortals</h3>
<p>The pattern on the lamp’s body flickered as swirls spun in circles. A flame was spontaneously ignited at the mouth of the lamp, giving off an inexplicable demonic charm as it danced. It was like a seductive woman twisting her waist while dancing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s gaze was attracted by the strange flame as though it was the most beautiful woman in the world. He couldn’t help but become engrossed, unable to shift his gaze away from the flame.</p>
<p>He was extremely determined, so when he felt that something was amiss, he forcefully shifted his gaze away from the flame.</p>
<p>However, when his gaze moved away from the flame, he was attracted by the shimmering patterns on the bronze lamp. Only then did Zhou Wen realize that the patterns weren’t simple patterns. Instead, they were ancient words. The demonic powers contained in them were countless times stronger than the flame, making him unconsciously attracted.</p>
<p>How is this happening! Zhou Wen’s fingers on his left hand suddenly moved, as though they were playing a piano. However, his mind hadn’t willed his fingers to make any movements.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to use his other hand to control his left hand, but his other hand’s fingers moved along with it.</p>
<p>Soon, it wasn’t only his fingers, but Zhou Wen’s entire body. He moved uncontrollably in an irregular fashion, something he realized to be dancing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had never come into contact with dancing, nor was he interested in dancing. He didn’t even watch dancing shows, but he was now like a professional dancer. His body danced with the rhythm of the music, making all sorts of moves he had never thought of before.</p>
<p>And no matter how he looked at it, he could see that it was a woman’s dance moves. They were enchanting and charming, light and elegant.</p>
<p>However, to have a man dance it made him look extremely comical. If Li Xuan were here to see him, he would probably be rolling on the ground laughing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried his best to control himself, but it was useless. He had repeatedly switched a few Primordial Energy Arts, but they were all useless. His body was squirming more and more intensely, and there were also many coquettish moves included.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen discovered that his actions were identical to the flickering of the lamp. It was as though he was a puppet controlled by the flame.</p>
<p>Damn it… What the hell is this… Zhou Wen felt as though he was going crazy.</p>
<p>As his dance sped up, the Lost Immortal Sutra which automatically circulated slowed down. As the Lost Immortal Sutra slowed down, Zhou Wen’s body gradually slowed down.</p>
<p>When the Lost Immortal Sutra completely stopped circulating, Zhou Wen’s body also stopped twisting.</p>
<p>However, the next second, the Primordial Energy in his body circulated in a frenzy, but it was no longer the path of the Lost Immortal Sutra. Instead, it was another Primordial Energy Art that Zhou Wen had never cultivated before.</p>
<p>The patterns on the oil lamp are also a Primordial Energy Art? Zhou Wen was astonished but also somewhat delighted.</p>
<p>This Primordial Energy Art was very odd. It was different from anything Zhou Wen had previously come into contact with. It seemed to have countless odd transformations, and at times, it was light and graceful, at other times as forceful as a storm. It made Zhou Wen have the urge to tear through the air and dance.</p>
<p>Time ticked by. By the time Zhou Wen regained control of his body, he had already mastered the Primordial Energy Art.</p>
<p>The oil lamp that had been floating in the air suddenly lost its radiance and fell to the ground. It returned to its old and damaged state.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was just about to pick up the oil lamp when he suddenly felt something amiss with his body. The Primordial Energy Art he had just mastered instantly dissipated as the Lost Immortal Sutra began to circulate again.</p>
<p>However, the circulation this time was different from the previous one. Primordial Energy flowed through his body like blood circling his body.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt his brain buzz as a voice resounded incessantly.</p>
<p>“If God opposes me, I will slay God… If an immortal opposes me, I will cull the immortal… No exchanges with god… No acquaintances with immortals… I am me…” The voice was unbridled and savage, but it also had a terrifying power that made his blood boil. It was as if something was stirring in one’s heart, eager to poke a hole in the sky.</p>
<p>This voice wasn’t unfamiliar to Zhou Wen. Over the countless nights he had cultivated in the Lost Immortal Sutra, the voice had kept whispering into his ear. However, in the past, he couldn’t hear the voice clearly.</p>
<p>Today, he finally heard what that voice was saying. It was a woman’s voice, but it had a heart-stopping aura. It was as if all living beings from the various worlds would fall prostrate at her feet.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen only heard a voice, he couldn’t help but envision a scene. Countless deities prostrating themselves on the ground, bowing towards a woman as though on a pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this was just Zhou Wen’s imagination and was able to see the woman’s face clearly. He felt that her bearing was incomparable. She was lofty, but she wasn’t as holy as an immortal or Buddha. She had a killing aura.</p>
<p>The voice in his mind became weaker and weaker, as if it was about to disperse. In the end, it was almost inaudible.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen vaguely heard a sentence that sounded a little different from the repeated sentence he had just heard: “My return… Will spell… the death of all immortals…”</p>
<p>However, the voice at the end was so soft that he didn’t hear the complete sentence.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The Lost Immortal Sutra in his body seemed to explode as all the cells seemed to bind together. It made Zhou Wen suspect if his body had self-destructed.</p>
<p>Falling… Constantly falling…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt as though his consciousness had plunged into the deep sea as it constantly plummeted. Finally, his consciousness was completely submerged in the darkness.</p>
<p>Ever since he had mastered the Lost Immortal Sutra, he hadn’t had a proper sleep.</p>
<p>Every time he fell asleep, no matter where he was or what time it was, there would be a voice whispering into his ear, akin to scripture chantings by Buddha or a devil’s enticements.</p>
<p>Together with the sleep paralysis, anyone else would have gone berserk.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen grinding every day was certainly to raise his strength, but it also included his thoughts of trying to avoid sleeping.</p>
<p>Up to this day, the feeling of being haunted by ghosts finally completely dissipated. Zhou Wen slept soundly as though nothing in the world was more blissful than having a good sleep.</p>
<p>When he woke up and stretched his back, he felt so comfortable that he almost moaned in delight. All his cells seemed to emit comfortable cheers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pressed his palm down on the bed to sit up, but when he pressed down, his body bounced up, slamming his head into the ceiling. Half his head was inside the ceiling made of steel and cement, leaving him dangling from it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter133'>Chapter 133 Exchange Student</h3>
<p>“Pui! Pui!”Zhou Wen spat out the cement in his mouth and looked at his hands in surprise. What’s going on?</p>
<p>After some thought, he recalled what had happened yesterday and seemed to realize something. He quickly took out his mysterious phone and pricked his finger with a needle, dripping a drop of fresh blood onto the screen.</p>
<p>The blood quickly coagulated into the blood-colored avatar. Zhou Wen looked at its stats and was overjoyed. He had indeed advanced to the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>He eagerly checked the blood-colored avatar’s attributes only to be left somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen</p>
<p>Age: 16 years</p>
<p>Level: Legendary</p>
<p>Legendary Life Providence: Sigh of the King</p>
<p>Strength: 12</p>
<p>Speed: 12</p>
<p>Constitution: 12</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 12</p>
<p>Primordial Energy Art: Lost Immortal Sutra</p>
<p>Primordial Energy Skill: Astral Suction Palm, Astral Slash Blade, Astral Suction Palm, …</p>
<p>Companion Beast: Truth Listener, Banana Fairy, Mutated Lotus Flower Ant, Silver-Winged Flying Ant</p>
<p>His stats and Primordial Energy Art were considered normal, but his Legendary Life Providence was a little strange. Typically, ordinary people weren’t able to see their attributes in the game like Zhou Wen, but after advancing to Legendary, they were able to sense the basic abilities of their Legendary Life Providence and know how it could be used.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen couldn’t sense what his Life Providence could be used for. All he could sense was that his Life Providence’s powers needed certain conditions to be triggered.</p>
<p>As for the triggering conditions, Zhou Wen only had a vague sense which wasn’t too clear.</p>
<p>When he looked at the additional note regarding Sigh of the King in-game, there was only one sentence: Sigh of the King, it is endless sinking.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t understand the meaning of the annotation, so he was momentarily unsure whether his Life Providence was good or bad.</p>
<p>However, being able to advance to the Legendary stage was ultimately a boon. It meant that Zhou Wen could finally incubate a Legendary Companion Egg without any reservations. He could also absorb high-valued dimensional crystals to raise his stats.</p>
<p>As for killing Epic creatures, Zhou Wen didn’t have a blind sense of self-importance. The difference between the Epic and Legendary stages was far greater than the difference between the Legendary and Mortal stages. The weakest Epic could easily kill the strongest Legendary.</p>
<p>It wasn’t only because an Epic’s attributes were higher, but also because an Epic’s life possessed a form of soul protection. They were completely different from Legendaries, making it an extremely difficult task to defeat an Epic at the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>Whatever. I’ll increase my stats first. Zhou Wen picked up the mysterious phone. He wanted to enter the game and use some high-valued dimensional crystals to raise his stats. Otherwise, even if he had advanced to the Legendary stage, he would still be one of the weakest.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and An Jing had their family’s support, so it was very simple for them to raise their stats. They just needed to use the dimensional crystals prepared by their families, but Zhou Wen needed to rely on himself.</p>
<p>Before he could launch a dungeon on his phone, the doorbell rang.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, what treasure did you choose from Providence Palace? It can’t be that your luck was so bad to choose a urinal or something, right?” Li Xuan didn’t dare enter the room as he looked straight in. When he saw the antelope sleeping on the couch, he immediately retracted his head.</p>
<p>“See for yourself.” Zhou Wen invited Li Xuan into the house.</p>
<p>“No, no, no. I’m not going in. I’m not here to see the treasure you chose. Counselor Wang Fei got me to tell you that she wants you to see her.” Li Xuan quickly shrank back again.</p>
<p>“Why is the Counselor looking for me?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>“She didn’t say, but I’m guessing it has something to do with the exchange students with from Covenant College,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen didn’t understand. Covenant College was a famous school in the West District and was worlds apart from Sunset College. Even if there was an exchange student, it shouldn’t have anything to do with him.</p>
<p>Li Xuan smiled and said, “There’s an exchange student from Covenant College here in Sunset College to study for a period of time. I heard that the exchange student is quite extraordinary. He’s from one of the Six League Heroes families. He’s famous at Covenant College and is considered as the heir to the six heroes. He’s the most likely person to reach the level of the six heroes.”</p>
<p>“What has this got to do with me?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“Since it’s an exchange student, they will interact with students from our college after arriving. In order to not lose face, the school will definitely let the best students interact with that fellow. Having entered the top ten at the comprehensive test, it’s normal for the school to give you such an important mission. However, I don’t think it’s any of your business. After all, your ranking in the top ten is too low. As long as you stand out, it will definitely be Huang Ji, Wei Ge, and An Jing who will deal with that exchange student. Just watch the show,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought that it made sense and went to Wang Fei’s office.</p>
<p>It was just as Li Xuan guessed. Wang Fei informed him that an exchange student from Covenant College was coming to study at Sunset College.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, do you know who the exchange student is?” Wang Fei asked.</p>
<p>“Is this related to me?” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Of course it has something to do with you. Otherwise, why would I especially summon you here? If it was just an ordinary exchange student, you wouldn’t be needed.” Wang Fei paused. “The student’s name is John. Like Liz, he comes from a family with the last name Cape.”</p>
<p>“Liz?” Zhou Wen frowned slightly.</p>
<p>Wang Fei continued, “John is Liz’s younger brother, but he’s different from the poorly talented Liz. His talent is almost comparable to the hero from the Cape family. Not only did he inherit the physique of the hero, but he also obtained an extremely powerful Life Providence when he advanced to the Legendary stage. In the west, he has the title of a Saint.”</p>
<p>“So what?” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Do you need me to go into the details between Liz and you? Given John’s status, even if he came to Sunset College, he wouldn’t purposely challenge a Mortal. However, you happened to be ranked in the top 10 at the comprehensive test as a Mortal stage. This gave John an excuse to challenge you. When the time comes, even if he doesn’t dare to do anything to you in Sunset College, it will be a disgrace to both you and Sunset College if you were to suffer a terrible defeat.”</p>
<p>Wang Fei paused for a moment before saying, “That’s why the school hopes that you can go home for a few days and not give John a chance to challenge you.”</p>
<p>“If he’s really out to get me, won’t he come knocking on my door even if I were to hide in my dorm?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“It’s alright. You can return to the An family home to rest for a few days. The school will approve your leave,” Wang Fei said.</p>
<p>“There’s no need.” Zhou Wen directly rejected it. He definitely wasn’t going to seek protection from the An family.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, if you really had the strength to be in the top ten, the school doesn’t mind you fighting with John. It doesn’t matter even if you lose. However, I think you should know better than me how you ended up in the top ten. The school didn’t hold it against you for the sake of the An family. However, you should know that your current strength isn’t enough to represent Sunset College’s top standards. It’d be meaningless to accept such a challenge,” Wang Fei said.</p>
<h3 id='chapter134'>Chapter 134 Mutated Demonized General</h3>
<p>“Counselor, although my strength isn’t enough to represent the college, there’s no need for me to be afraid of John, much less escape.” Zhou Wen bowed slightly to Wang Fei before turning to leave the office.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that Zhou Wen had already advanced to the Legendary stage, even if he wasn’t John’s match, he still wouldn’t choose to flee to the An family residence.</p>
<p>This fellow’s surname isn’t An, but why is he as stubborn as the An siblings? Wang Fei watched Zhou Wen leave the office and couldn’t help but worry.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen returned to his dorm, he launched an instant dungeon and began grinding crazily. He wanted to spawn some high-level dimensional crystals and quickly raise his attributes.</p>
<p>Ding! After killing a Silver-Winged Flying Ant, a 14-valued Speed Crystal dropped. The blood-colored avatar absorbed the Speed Crystal and his Speed increased to 14.</p>
<p>Ding! After killing a Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus, a 13-valued Primordial Energy Crystal dropped. The blood-colored avatar absorbed it and his Primordial Energy increased to 13.</p>
<p>Ding! After killing a Skeleton General, a Skeleton General Companion Egg dropped.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen unhesitatingly incubated it and obtained a Skeleton General Companion Beast. However, the Companion Beast’s stats and skills were relatively average.</p>
<p>While grinding the Lotus Flower Cave, Zhou Wen was once again lucky enough to spawn a Fairy Monkey Companion Egg. When he incubated it, the stats weren’t too bad, but they weren’t considered excellent-grade stats.</p>
<p>Since it wasn’t an excellent-grade Companion Beast and its skills weren’t anything special, Zhou Wen decided to attempt a fusion when he saw that the Skeleton General and the Fairy Monkey had a compatibility score of 57% which was a rather high success rate.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was extremely disappointed. The fusion failed as the two Companion Beasts disintegrated simultaneously.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew how lucky his Mutated Lotus Flower Ant had been at succeeding from the recent fusion failures. The chances were about the same as winning the lottery.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen was able to keep grinding dungeons. His chances of dropping a Companion Egg were much higher than the average person. After persisting for an entire day and night, Zhou Wen’s stats experienced a significant boost. His Strength and Constitution had reached 16 points. His Speed and Primordial Energy were slightly weaker and had only increased to 15 points.</p>
<p>This made Zhou Wen clearly feel that his body was much stronger. During this process, he managed to raise his Dragon Gate Fairy Skill to Rank 9, raising his movement technique to its limit.</p>
<p>Rank 9 was a standard Primordial Energy Skill limit. There was no way to continue raising it with Primordial Energy Skill Crystals. In the past, Rank 9 was the highest Zhou Wen could reach. However, with the precedent of Ashen Palm, he knew that Rank 9 wasn’t the limit and that there was room for improvement. However, that required him to train and figure it out himself before being able to reach Dragon Gate Fairy Skill’s limit of Rank 10.</p>
<p>It was unknown how many times he had entered Tiger Cage Pass dungeon before he encountered a Demonized General with the word “Fist” engraved on its helmet. It delighted Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Seeing the Demonized General turn golden in color, like a golden-armored god of war, Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to charge forward instead of retreating, clashing head-on with the Fist Demonized General.</p>
<p>Now that Zhou Wen had advanced to the Legendary stage, his speed had increased significantly. Coupled with the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s silver wings, his speed was no longer slower than the Fist Demonized General’s. He easily dodged its strange spear’s</p>
<p>rust before slashing at its neck with his hand wrapped in the lotus flower bracer.</p>
<p>With a clang, Zhou Wen’s present strength combined with the lotus flower bracer was still unable to damage the Fist Demonized General. Instead, his opponent balled its other hand into a fist and threw a punch at the blood-colored avatar’s stomach.</p>
<p>Astral Suction Palm! Zhou Wen guessed that the Astral Suction Palm could restrain the Fist Demonized General’s Primordial Energy Skill. Unsure if it was true, he gave it a try.</p>
<p>The strength of the Fist Demonized General’s fist was extremely domineering, as though it had gathered all of its energy into one point. Even the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant at the same level would explode with one punch.</p>
<p>The Astral Suction Palm appeared nothing powerful with how soft and weak it was. The instant his palm clashed with the fist, Zhou Wen felt a strange feeling. His Astral Suction Palm seemed to be able to guide the forces of the Demonized General’s fist.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen pulled and pushed with his Astral Suction Palm, directing the Demonized General’s domineering punch right back into the other side of his enemy’s chest. With a boom, the armor on his body shattered and blood spewed out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted when he saw this. He controlled the blood-colored avatar to charge forward, penetrating the wound on the Demonized General’s chest with his palm which wore the lotus flower bracer. This impact burst the heart inside.</p>
<p>‘Killed Fist Demonized General. Discovered Companion Egg.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still immersed in the excitement of his killing the Fist Demonized General for the first time when he saw the system notification appear. He couldn’t help but be pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>Upon careful look, he saw a black-colored Companion Egg drop on the ground. He hurriedly ordered the blood-colored avatar to pick it up but seeing its attributes, he couldn’t help but find it odd.</p>
<p>Mutated Demonized General: Legendary</p>
<p>Legendary Life Providence: Malignant General</p>
<p>Strength: 19</p>
<p>Speed: 17</p>
<p>Constitution: 18</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 18</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Astral Fist, Demon Flame Spear, Demon Rider Summon</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>How can a Mutated Demonized General not have a Companion Form? Zhou Wen found it odd, but its stats were really high. It was considered a top-notch existence among Legendaries.</p>
<p>He directly incubated the Mutated Demonized General since he had no plans on giving such an excellent-grade Companion Beast as food.</p>
<p>He summoned the incubated Mutated Demonized General and it was exactly the same as the one in the game. A burly Demonic General riding on a red horse, with a strange spear in his hand. With one charge, the strange spear in its hand could knock over a large number of Demonized Soldiers. It was extremely powerful.</p>
<p>Another Demonized General! Zhou Wen was delighted. With the boost provided by the Demonized General’s skills—far greater than the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant and the Silver-Winged Flying Ant-it was good as a vanguard.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the excitement of having a new Companion Beast, Zhou Wen continued grinding. He wanted to raise his stats in one fell swoop. It would be best if he could raise everything to 18.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to luck, Zhou Wen encountered another Mutated Demonized General when he respawned again and went to Tiger Cage Pass. However, the Demonized General’s helmet had the word ‘Blade’ engraved on it this time.</p>
<p>He didn’t attack himself, allowing the Fist Demonized General to charge forward. Due to the effectiveness of the Fist Demonized General against the Blade Demonized General, it killed the Blade Demonized General with one charge.</p>
<p>The Blade Demonized General’s Astral Slash Blade was shattered by the Astral Punch and was made completely useless.</p>
<p>Exceeding Zhou Wen’s expectations, the Blade Demonized General once again dropped a Companion Egg. Having obtained two Mutated Demonized General Companion Eggs consecutively, this was a probability that Zhou Wen found unbelievable.</p>
<p>Mutated Demonized General: Legendary</p>
<p>Legendary Life Providence: Malignant General</p>
<p>Strength: 19</p>
<p>Speed: 18</p>
<p>Constitution: 17</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 16</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Astral Slash Blade, Demon Flame Spear, Demon Rider Summon</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<h3 id='chapter135'>Chapter 135 Demonic Words</h3>
<p>The Blade Demonized General’s attributes were similar to the Fist Demonized General’s. Only its talent skills were somewhat different.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the system notification and discovered that the compatibility score between the two Demonized Generals was as high as 88%. It tempted him greatly, and in the end, he couldn’t help but tap on the fusion button.</p>
<p>Ding! When he heard the system’s chime, Zhou Wen’s heart couldn’t help but pound. He was even a little nervous.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a compatibility score of 88% was as true as it gets. The fusion succeeded and produced a new Demonized General.</p>
<p>Just by looking at the new Demonized General’s appearance, it seemed to be even more ferocious and domineering. It wore red-vested armor, and its eyes were fiercely glowing red. It looked like a ferocious general in a raging inferno.</p>
<p>And the word engraved on its helmet was neither Blade nor First, but the word “Demon.”</p>
<p>Mutated Demonized General: Legendary</p>
<p>Legendary Life Providence: Malignant General</p>
<p>Strength: 19</p>
<p>Speed: 18</p>
<p>Constitution: 18</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 18</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Astral Slash Blade, Astral Fist, Demon Flame Spear, Demon Rider Summon</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>These stats are a little sick. Furthermore, it also has the Astral Slash Blade and Astral Fist skills. If I were to obtain another Paper Demonized General Companion Beast and fuse with it, would it result in an excellent-grade with all three skills? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t easy to have two Mutated Demonized General Companion Eggs drop. It was unknown how long it would take to have another one drop.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen had to grind Tiger Cage Pass dungeon every day, so he wasn’t in a rush. There were always opportunities.</p>
<p>The Mutated Demonized General was good at the offensive and defensive. It killed everything in its way, and together with the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant and Silver-Winged Flying Ant, they formed a team that could kill monsters from both air, land, and sea. Most of the time, the blood-colored avatar didn’t even need to move a finger to kill the dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>With my current strength and Truth Listener at the Legendary stage, can I try clearing Ant City? Zhou Wen had always been obsessed with the golden beam of light in Ant City. However, previously he had been lacking in strength and couldn’t make much progress. Now that he had advanced to the Legendary stage and had four top-notch Legendary Companion Beasts, it seemed like he could make an attempt.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, we can finally register our own club. What do you think it should be called? Do you think it’s better to call it the God of Combat Alliance or Invincible Club?” Li Xuan walked into the living room excitedly.</p>
<p>“Up to you.” Zhou Wen was grinding Ant Nest, so he didn’t have the capacity to care. Furthermore, he wasn’t obsessive-compulsive. He would accept any name.</p>
<p>“Don’t mind. This is our club. There’s meaning only if we think of names together. Those two aren’t good. What do you think about Xuanwen? Our names are both in it. Others can tell that it’s our club,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Zhou Wen nodded while gaming-the blood-colored avatar had already rushed to the periphery of Ant City.</p>
<p>“Then that’s it. Let’s register for the Xuanwen Club.” Li Xuan pulled Zhou Wen out excitedly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to follow him out. But when they arrived, they realized that setting up a club didn’t just require filling in an application form. They had to gather at least five people to submit the application to establish a club.</p>
<p>“Why do we need so many people? The two of us are good enough to beat everyone in the world.” Li Xuan’s heart stirred as he looked at Zhou Wen and asked, “It won’t be easy to find people now. Almost all the senior students have already joined clubs. After more than a month, most of the freshmen have been roped in. It will be very difficult to find suitable people. Your two high school classmates seemed to be interested in our club. Why don’t you rope them in to make up the numbers?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure if they have joined other clubs or not,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Then let’s make a call and ask. Do you have the phone number of that beautiful woman named Fang something?” Li Xuan urged.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to take out his ordinary phone and call Fang Ruoxi while gaming with one hand.</p>
<p>“F*ck, you even have a game-only phone and a phone for calls. Bro, you sure are extravagant,” Li Xuan teased.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored him and called Fang Ruoxi. He heard her voice and asked, “Hello, is this Fang Ruoxi?”</p>
<p>“It’s me. Li Xuan and I established a club. If you and Tian Xiangdong haven’t joined other clubs, why don’t you consider it?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“We haven’t joined anything yet. I heard that you were setting up a club, so we have been waiting for your invitation,” Fang Ruoxi replied with a smile.</p>
<p>“Alright, we are still short of one person. I’ll contact you after we find everyone.” Zhou Wen hung up after making an agreement with Fang Ruoxi.</p>
<p>“Quite swell of this old classmate of yours. She’s pretty and pure, and she has some feelings for you. You have to act as early as possible. Otherwise, she’ll be contaminated by this mixing bowl known as university,” Li Xuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Don’t spout nonsense. She’s just an old classmate,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Now we have four people. We are still short of one. Who do you think we should get?” Li Xuan tugged at his hair in frustration.</p>
<p>“Is it that difficult for Young Master Li to find someone?” Zhou Wen looked at Li Xuan in confusion.</p>
<p>“It’s really not difficult to find someone. Just a simple call and I can get a dozen or two. However, I’m afraid that there might be my brother’s people among them. I’m more at ease with people you recruit,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“I don’t know anyone…” Zhou Wen suddenly thought of something as he asked Li Xuan, “Do you know Gu Dian?”</p>
<p>“Of course I know him. How can I not know this person? He’s the school’s most problematic person. He beat up a senior when he had just started school. He’s a person who only recognizes money. As long as he’s paid, he will do anything…” Li Xuan said as he looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement. “Why are you asking about him?”</p>
<p>“Has he joined a club?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Let’s not even talk about him having thoughts of joining a club; even if he does, no one will want him. Who knows when he might beat up the people in his club. That would be such a joke… Wait… Don’t tell me you want to recruit him?” Li Xuan widened his eyes.</p>
<p>“I think he’s not bad. If there’s really no other candidate, we can give him a try,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That won’t do. Such a person will definitely be bribed by my brother. When the time comes, he will harm us once again.” Li Xuan shook his head repeatedly.</p>
<p>“Do you think the others won’t be bribed by your brother?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was slightly taken aback before he smiled bitterly. “You are right. As long as my brother wants it done, it’s useless who I find.”</p>
<p>“At least Gu Dian has a clear price. Let’s be wary of him. It’s better than people that put on different facades, right?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You’re right. However, there were people who invited Gu Dian in the past. He didn’t join either. It won’t be easy inviting him to join our club,” Li Xuan said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“Can you find him? Let’s give it a try,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<h3 id='chapter136'>Chapter 136 Myriad Buddha Cave</h3>
<p>“Are you sure Gu Dian is here?” Zhou Wen looked at the Myriad Buddha Cave in front of him and looked at Li Xuan in disbelief.</p>
<p>“There’s no mistake about it. According to what I learned, Gu Dian is a weirdo. Ever since he entered school, he hasn’t slept in his dorm. As long as he’s not in class, he will definitely come to Dragon Gate Grotto. It’s normal for him to spend half a month here. I received accurate news that he entered Myriad Buddha Cave three days ago and hasn’t come out yet. There’s no mistake about him being inside,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Do you honestly think someone can live inside here?” Zhou Wen said as he pointed at the Golden Warriors wandering around the Myriad Buddha Cave.</p>
<p>There were relatively rare dimensional creatures in Dragon Gate Grotto. Typically, they were at the Mortal stage. As long as their numbers were few, ordinary students could handle them.</p>
<p>However, the Golden Warriors in the Myriad Buddha Cave were different. Not only were they at the Legendary stage, but they also had powerful defensive strength. Legendary students needed a great deal of effort to kill them. It was very difficult.</p>
<p>Unless there was a special requirement, the average Legendary wouldn’t be willing to come here to kill a Golden Warrior.</p>
<p>At that moment in the Myriad Buddha Cave, he could see two or three Golden Warriors wandering around. Zhou Wen didn’t believe that students could live here for two to three days.</p>
<p>Even if he had the ability to fight with a Golden Warrior, it was impossible for him to fight for three days and three nights. He would probably die from exhaustion in one day, much less three days and three nights.</p>
<p>“The news shouldn’t be wrong. Gu Dian is a weirdo. He often does this kind of thing. No one knows how he survives in the dimensional zones, but he manages to. It’s likely that he’s inside the Myriad Buddha Cave,” Li Xuan said with certainty.</p>
<p>“Since that’s the case, let’s go in and take a look.” Zhou Wen had entered the Myriad Buddha Cave in-game and knew that it was difficult to kill a Golden Warrior. However, their Speed wasn’t very fast. He just needed to avoid them since he was only spending a short amount of time to find Gu Dian.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Zhou Wen enter, Li Xuan followed him into the Myriad Buddha Cave.</p>
<p>Seeing that someone had stepped into the Myriad Buddha Cave, Golden Warriors immediately rushed over. Their bodies were dark as if they were carved from some kind of jade. Every step they took left a deep footprint on the ground, indicating their extreme weight.</p>
<p>Li Xuan drew his saber and slashed down at the Golden Warrior that was charging right in front of him. His saber was fast and ruthless and was transformed from a Legendary Companion Beast. If an ordinary Legendary creature were to be struck by him, they would have their bones cleaved through even if they didn’t die.</p>
<p>However, when the blade landed on the Golden Warrior, sparks flew everywhere, producing a sound of metallic hum. Only a faint white mark was left on the Golden Warrior while Li Xuan’s palm went numb from the shock.</p>
<p>“It’s harder than the legends say!” Li Xuan hurriedly dodged, afraid to clash head-on with the Golden Warriors.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen dashed in and had no intention of fighting the Golden Warriors. Not only were they strong, but they also possessed the talent skill, Golden Bell.</p>
<p>Unless someone wanted to have Golden Bell drop, no one would waste their time killing Golden Warriors. Unfortunately, the drop rate of Golden Bell was very low, making the Warriors unpopular among students.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Golden Warriors were naturally slow, so it was impossible for them to catch up to Zhou Wen and Li Xuan. As they ran, they avoided the Golden Warriors’ attacks and entered the Myriad Buddha Cave.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because no one had been here to kill the Golden Warriors for a while, there were plenty of them in the cave. After covering a few hundred meters, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan had about thirty to forty Golden Warriors chasing behind them.</p>
<p>“Is Gu Dian really here?” At that moment, even Li Xuan himself doubted the authenticity of the information he had received. No matter how he looked at it, there didn’t seem to be anyone here.</p>
<p>Just as Li Xuan was about to suggest returning, he suddenly saw a Golden Warrior rushing out of the cavern in front of him. However, it was different from the typical black Golden Warrior. It was covered in golden light and there was a single golden vertical eye on its forehead.</p>
<p>“Three-Eyed Golden Warrior!” Li Xuan exclaimed when he saw the warrior. However, it was a more pleasant surprise than horror.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Zhou Wen had never seen a Three-Eyed Golden Warrior. Back when he entered the Myriad Buddha Cave in-game, he hadn’t ventured too deep. This was because it was too difficult to kill the Golden Warriors. He wasn’t interested.</p>
<p>In the time it took to kill a Golden Warrior, he could kill at least more than ten Legendary creatures.</p>
<p>“Three-Eyed Golden Warriors are an extremely rare Legendary creature. It should be a mutated version of Golden Warriors; however, their skills are different from that of other Golden Warriors. Typically, most Golden Warriors only drop two Primordial Energy Skills—Golden Palm and Golden Bell. As for the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior’s Primordial Energy Skill, it’s called Invulnerable Golden Power, one that’s far higher than Golden Bell. Not only is the Primordial Energy expenditure low, but the defensive strength is even higher… Since we encountered it today, let’s just kill it first. It will be great if the Invulnerable Golden Body drops.” As Li Xuan spoke, he rushed towards the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior.</p>
<p>He used all his strength to slash at it, but the Speed of the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior was much faster than the typical Golden Warrior. It didn’t show any signs of clumsiness.</p>
<p>As Li Xuan slashed down, the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior actually raised its hand and grabbed Li Xuan’s saber in midair before forcefully twisting it.</p>
<p>The Legendary saber in Li Xuan’s hand was twisted around. In the end, it couldn’t withstand the terrifying force and broke into several pieces.</p>
<p>“My Frost Cicada Saber!” Li Xuan felt his heart ache so much that he nearly vomited blood. He had recently been unlucky and had already sacrificed several Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen swept past the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior’s head and struck out with his palm, hitting the top of its head.</p>
<p>With a clang, the Rank 10 Ashen Palm failed to injure it. The Three-Eyed Golden Warrior turned its head and struck out with Golden Palm, striking at Zhou Wen’s back like a bolt of lightning</p>
<p>Its palm move was like lightning-fast and ruthless. With Zhou Wen’s body in midair, it was as though he had no way of dodging. Li Xuan was alarmed as he kicked at the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior and shouted, “Old Zhou, dodge!”</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s kick was rather heavy-it was enough to snap a tree that was as thick as a person. However, the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior seemed oblivious to the attack as it ignored him. Without moving, the Golden Palm continued its trajectory towards Zhou Wen’s back.</p>
<p>In midair, Zhou Wen suddenly drew out a trajectory like a strange bird, dodging the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior’s strike.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, who was like an eagle, was hovering above the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior. At the same time, he repeatedly struck with his palms, clashing with the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior.</p>
<p>Li Xuan, who was standing by the side, had no means to join in. Furthermore, large groups of Golden Warriors had gathered around them, instantly cutting off all paths of retreat.</p>
<h3 id='chapter137'>Chapter 137 Three-Eyed Golden Warrior</h3>
<p>“Old Zhou, there are too many Golden Warriors. I can’t hold on any longer, quickly retreat!” Li Xuan shouted as he dodged the power Golden Warriors.</p>
<p>“Hold on. Give me three minutes,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Three minutes? Even thirty seconds would be too difficult. Three-Eyed Golden Warriors are too difficult to kill. We definitely won’t be able to kill it in a short period of time. Let’s go back and get more people to come over. We can clean up this group of Golden Warrior hindrances before slowly killing it. Besides, I really can’t last three minutes,” Li Xuan shouted while fighting.</p>
<p>“Two minutes,” Zhou Wen said again.</p>
<p>“F*ck, if you can’t kill it, my blood will be on your hands.” Li Xuan gritted his teeth and summoned a Companion Beast armor to protect his body as he charged into the Golden Warriors’ ferocious attacks, slamming one of them back several steps.</p>
<p>“If the tiger doesn’t show its might, do you really think I’m HELLO KITTY?” Li Xuan was like a god of combat that had descended to the mortal world. His body slammed forward, his fists unleashed a barrage of attacks, and he managed to charge out of the crowd of Golden Warriors.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have the time or mood to appreciate Li Xuan’s ferocious appearance. He circled above the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior like a hawk, dodging its Golden Palm. At the same time, he struck out repeatedly with his palm, striking the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior’s head.</p>
<p>Even with the augmentation of the lotus bracer, Zhou Wen’s might made it very difficult for him to injure the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior. Every collision was like a clash of metal as sparks flew.</p>
<p>Although it seemed to be filled with zest, Zhou Wen’s palm strikes couldn’t hurt the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior at all. At most, it only made it uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The Three-Eyed Golden Warrior didn’t feel good either. It waved its palm again and again, but it failed to even touch the corner of Zhou Wen’s clothes. Zhou Wen was like a giant fly flying above it.</p>
<p>“Roar!” Even the most mild-tempered Buddha would be enraged, much less an irascible warrior. With Zhou Wen enraging it, the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior’s palm glowed with golden light as it used all its might to strike at the airborne Zhou Wen in an indomitable manner.</p>
<p>It’s now! Zhou Wen’s eyes focused as he no longer relied on his movement technique or silver wings to dodge in the air. He flattened his left hand as he sucked at the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior’s bloodthirsty Golden Palm.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s palm was blood-red, as though it possessed an invisible force that deviated the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior’s palm to the side.</p>
<p>With a boom, the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior delivered its full might with Golden Palm to its forehead, shattering the forehead with the vertical eye, as well as the golden eye.</p>
<p>The Three-Eyed Golden Warrior collapsed to the ground with a loud thud. Within its own shattered skull, there was a strange dazzling golden glow.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen landed in front of the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior’s corpse and reached into its head. He pulled out a golden crystal bead the size of a goose egg. Inside it, there was a Three-Eyed Golden Warrior figure shimmering-it was a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>My luck with Companion Eggs seems pretty good at the moment. Zhou Wen reeled with joy.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, stop staring blankly. I can’t hold it any longer. Quickly come and help!” Li Xuan shouted.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned his head and saw that he was surrounded by a group of Golden Warriors. They were pummeling Li Xuan until he was dizzy. His armor had cracked from the beating and was about to explode.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan’s Immortal God of Combat Life Providence and Invincible Connate Divine Art were really good at tanking. After being struck countless times, to the point of almost being beaten to a pulp, he still remained conscious. However, the situation looked extremely bad.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen threw the Companion Egg into his backpack as the silver wings on his back vibrated. Instantly, it transformed into a silver beam of light that flew above Li Xuan. He reached out and pulled Li Xuan into the air and landed on the Buddha statue on the mountain cliff.</p>
<p>“Don’t touch those Buddha statues!” Li Xuan immediately shouted when he saw this. His face was filled with horror.</p>
<p>However, he had shouted too late. Zhou Wen raised him with both hands as he stepped on the Buddha statue’s shoulder and used the momentum to once again leap into the sky.</p>
<p>“It’s over… It’s over… Old Zhou… You’re really trying to kill me… In the future, you should just stay at home and play games. No number of lives is enough coming out with you.” Li Xuan nearly cried.</p>
<p>There were countless Buddha statues in Myriad Buddha Cave. Before becoming a dimensional zone, there were more than ten thousand of them, but the number was inestimable after the area became a dimensional zone.</p>
<p>In Myriad Buddha Cave, everything could be touched, but not the Buddha statues. Once touched, the Buddha statue would awaken. Although it wouldn’t really stand up, with the awakening of the Buddha statue, all the dimensional creatures in Myriad Buddha Cave would go berserk. Their strength would greatly increase, and in addition, their bodies would also become even harder. Even their originally low speed would turn extremely fast.</p>
<p>Just the thought of a group of accelerated Golden Warriors was terrifying. It was almost impossible for the two of them to escape Myriad Buddha Cave alive with their Legendary stages.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen ignored Li Xuan. After he leaped into the air, he landed on the legs of a Buddha statue that was sitting at a greater height.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, why are you still stepping on them? Do you think our deaths need to be expedited?” Li Xuan felt that his name was already written in the King of Hell’s notebook.</p>
<p>The Golden Warriors below couldn’t come up, nor did they dare to touch the Buddha statues. As for Zhou Wen and Li Xuan, they stood there for quite a while without seeing any movement from the Buddha statues.</p>
<p>Li Xuan looked at them in confusion. “Could it be that these Buddha statues aren’t awake today?”</p>
<p>“That’s possible,” Zhou Wen said casually as he looked around Myriad Buddha Cave.</p>
<p>He had entered Myriad Buddha Cave in-game, so he naturally knew that the Buddha statues couldn’t be touched. However, that was before he used the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra.</p>
<p>As long as Zhou Wen switched his Primordial Energy Art to the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, he wouldn’t anger the Buddha statues no matter how much he touched them.</p>
<p>After all, the Buddha statue was only a statue, not a true Buddha. Even a true Buddha might mistake Zhou Wen as a pious child, so it was even more natural for the Buddha statues to fail to distinguish him.</p>
<p>This was because Zhou Wen’s Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra was too low. If he reached an extremely high level, most Buddha-type creatures would bow to him without daring to fight him.</p>
<p>The Golden Warriors were, after all, low-level dimensional creatures without any intelligence, so they lacked the ability to sense such weak auras of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, stop carrying me. Put me down now.” Li Xuan had been too nervous before, but now that he relaxed, he realized that Zhou Wen’s hands were still carrying him in a princess hold without letting him down.</p>
<p>“I think it’s better I carry you.” Zhou Wen didn’t know if his Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra could protect Li Xuan. It was fine if he stepped on it himself, but he didn’t know if it was okay for Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“I know I’m handsome, but you can’t have impure thoughts about me just because I’m handsome.” Li Xuan leaped out of Zhou Wen’s embrace and stood on the Buddha statue’s knee.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>As Li Xuan stood still, he suddenly felt the Buddha statue shake violently, nearly throwing him down, its eyes suffused a golden glow.</p>
<h3 id='chapter138'>Chapter 138 The Ship Anchor</h3>
<p>Li Xuan jumped in fright as he wrapped his arms around Zhou Wen’s neck and hung off his body.</p>
<p>However, it was already too late. The Buddha statue did not stop its anomalous change. The countless Buddha statues in Myriad Buddha Cave all suffused golden glows, illuminating the cave in a golden resplendence.</p>
<p>The ordinary Golden Warriors’ eyes also became golden. Their black jade-like bodies emitted golden glows as they stared straight at Zhou Wen and Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“They… shouldn’t be able to come up, right?” Li Xuan gulped and said with some difficulty.</p>
<p>Just as Li Xuan said that, he watched the warriors’ bodies as a golden halo appeared beneath their feet and began to levitate them. This only served to turn Li Xuan’s face green.</p>
<p>“Come here.” Just as the Golden Warriors were about to charge up with the golden halo, they suddenly heard a low and hoarse voice coming from above.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were alarmed as they hurriedly looked up and saw that in the middle of the many Buddha statues, a person had extended half his body and was waving at them.</p>
<p>That ferocious face that resembled a ferocious ghost was obviously Gu Dian’s.</p>
<p>“Why is Gu Dian here?” Li Xuan exclaimed.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to speak to Li Xuan. He leaped up with him in his arms as the silver wings on his back vibrated. Soon, he arrived at the spot where Gu Dian was standing</p>
<p>Only then did the two realize that in the middle of the two Buddha statues was a stone rift.</p>
<p>Gu Dian retreated and let the two of them follow him into the stone rift, leading them deeper in.</p>
<p>The Golden Warriors rose up with the help of the golden halo, but they didn’t dare touch the Buddha statues. All they could do was surround them from the outside without chasing up to them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan walked a distance with Gu Dian before the stone rift opened up. There was an uncarved stone cave inside.</p>
<p>The cave wasn’t small, and there was a pool below. There was clear spring water flowing in the pool, making it look very clear.</p>
<p>There were also some daily necessities in the cave, which looked like they belonged to Gu Dian.</p>
<p>“Everything outside will return to normal in an hour. You can then leave,” said Gu Dian coldly.</p>
<p>“Old Gu, we came specially for you. We plan on registering a club and wish to invite you.” Li Xuan exchanged looks with Zhou Wen and directly explained his intentions.</p>
<p>“Not interested.” Gu Dian said without lifting his head.</p>
<p>“Don’t be in such a hurry to reject it. Our club’s benefits are good. There will be quite a good membership allowance every month.” Having heard that Gu Dian loved money very much, Li Xuan hurriedly used monetary incentives.</p>
<p>“One hundred thousand a month. I’ll join if you pay me,” Gu Dian said.</p>
<p>100,000 was nothing to Li Xuan, but Gu Dian’s attitude displeased him. Furthermore, he had never heard of any club using money to buy members. Wouldn’t that be a joke?</p>
<p>Li Xuan wanted to say something but was stopped by Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen looked at Gu Dian and said, “Five members are needed to register a club. There are only four of us now. We wish to invite you on board, and it would be best if you are willing to join. If you aren’t willing, can you help us out and register with us? Although you will be one of our members in name, you actually don’t need to attend any of the club’s activities or be responsible for the club. How much would that cost?”</p>
<p>“10,000,” Gu Dian said straightforwardly.</p>
<p>“Alright, 10,000 it is. Li Xuan, pay up.” Zhou Wen agreed without hesitation, but the one paying had to be Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Just helping in the registration costs ten thousand? Isn’t that a little too easy?” Li Xuan said reluctantly.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I can’t find anyone else. Find someone else or pay. Choose one,” Zhou Wen said as he spread out his hands.</p>
<p>“Even if I’m willing to pay, I still need a signal. How am I to transfer money in this crappy place?” Li Xuan said gloomily.</p>
<p>“That’s settled then. You can return with us later. We’ll transfer the money to you once there’s a signal,” Zhou Wen said to Gu Dian.</p>
<p>“Sure,” said Gu Dian and he began packing his things.</p>
<p>Gu Dian reached out his hand for something on the mat and stuffed it into his pocket. Zhou Wen had been observing Gu Dian all this time, so his action left him puzzled.</p>
<p>When Gu Dian took the item, he had clearly used his body to block their line of sight, as though he didn’t want them to see it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had been wearing the Truth Listener earring during his previous battle. Through the abnormal hearing given to him by the earring, Zhou Wen could hear the shape of the item.</p>
<p>As Truth Listener only provided listening abilities and not true sight, all Zhou Wen knew was that it was a pocket watch. The exterior was likely made of metal. As for the color, it was unknown to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, there was a strange symbol engraved on the pocket watch’s surface, something that Zhou Wen seemed to have seen somewhere before.</p>
<p>After all, he had heard it without any color, making it different from true vision. Therefore, Zhou Wen momentarily couldn’t recall where he had seen the symbol before.</p>
<p>As he stared at Gu Dian who was thinking as he was packing his things, Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up. He finally remembered where he had seen such symbols.</p>
<p>The symbol on the pocket watch was a ship’s anchor, but it was different from the typical ship’s anchor. On the surface was a woman’s side profile.</p>
<p>According to what Zhou Wen knew, people who went out to sea to fish in the past were very particular about women. Typically, they wouldn’t let women go out to sea with them, nor would they carve women’s symbols on the boat.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen had a deep impression of the ship’s anchor when he saw it.</p>
<p>The last time he saw the symbol was when he followed Ouyang Lan to the Xiyuan Crystal Shop. In the room at basement four, there was a silver-haired Companion Beast in chains.</p>
<p>Behind the chain was a metal piece the size of a millstone. On the metal piece was a nine-number keypad, and on the side of the metal block was such a ship’s anchor symbol.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s mind was focused on the nine-number keypad back then, so he didn’t pay much attention to the ship’s anchor symbol. Furthermore, the symbol on the metal piece was huge while the pocket watch was very small. Therefore, Zhou Wen took a while before recalling the matter.</p>
<p>Is it a coincidence? Zhou Wen thought with a frown. Although the difference in size between the two symbols was huge and he hadn’t seen the anchor’s colors on the pocket watch, from the structure of the symbol, it was indeed the same.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, what did that Three-Eyed Golden Warrior drop? Quickly take it out and show it to me,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen handed Li Xuan the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior Companion Egg that dropped. When Li Xuan saw it, his eyes lit up as he cried out, “Why is your life so good? You actually had a Three-Eyed Golden Warrior Companion Egg drop. That was worth it. Totally worth it. There aren’t many of these things, so even if you have the money, you might not be able to buy them. It really was worth risking our lives for it.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter139'>Chapter 139 Working Hard to Improve</h3>
<p>“Do you like it?” Zhou Wen asked Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Nonsense. Who wouldn’t? This thing can only be obtained by chance. I’ve only heard of it in the past. I don’t even know what companion form this Companion Beast has,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Take it if you like it,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Really? Don’t you want it for yourself?” Li Xuan was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>“Of course I do. However, you have to give me the amount of money I deserve. It can’t be lower than the market price,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>The Three-Eyed Diamond Companion Egg might be difficult for others to obtain, but to Zhou Wen, it was just a little difficult. If he wanted, he could visit Myriad Buddha Cave multiple times in-game in the future. It wouldn’t be difficult for him to obtain one.</p>
<p>The game’s Companion Eggs couldn’t be sold in the real world, so it was best to sell Companion Eggs obtained in reality.</p>
<p>“Money isn’t a problem, but are you sure you don’t want to keep it for yourself? This item is truly rare and even if its companion form isn’t something you wish for, the Companion Beast is strong enough. It can be used as a meat shield and as a vanguard while charging ahead. Very few people can hurt it. It’s a rare excellent-grade beast,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“I don’t need it now. If I need one in the future, I’ll just get one more from the Myriad Buddha Cave,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Get one more? You make it sound easy. Ignoring the fact that Three-Eyed Golden Warriors are extremely rare, just the time it takes to spawn one takes months. And even if you manage to wait for its spawn, the chances of a Companion Egg dropping after killing it is less than 20%.” Li Xuan looked at Zhou Wen as though he was looking at an idiot.</p>
<p>“Why are you saying so much? If you don’t want it, just give it to me,” Zhou Wen said as he reached out his hand.</p>
<p>“Yes… but don’t regret it…” Li Xuan hurriedly clenched the Companion Egg in his hand.</p>
<p>Gu Dian said that the Myriad Buddha Cave would return to normal an hour later. There was still plenty of time, so Li Xuan couldn’t help but incubate the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior.</p>
<p>“Wow… Invulnerable Golden Power… Golden Palm… Double skills… Wow… Its companion form is actually a Golden Silk Soft Armor… It looks so cool…” When Li Xuan summoned the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior’s Golden Silk Soft Armor companion form, he deliberately walked in front of Zhou Wen and occasionally let out an exaggerated cry. Clearly, he was showing off on purpose.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored him without giving him a second look. All he did was lower his head and game.</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhou Wen was ignoring him, Li Xuan felt a little bored. He ignored Zhou Wen and went to Gu Dian to show off. He summoned the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior and ‘tsked’ in amazement. “Look at its body. Look at how domineering it is. It’s a rare excellent-grade beast. Old Gu, have you seen anyone else with such a Companion Beast after living in the Myriad Buddha Cave for so long?”</p>
<p>“Pay me and I’ll say no.” Gu Dian looked up at Li Xuan with a serious expression.</p>
<p>“How boring… The two of you are really boring…” Li Xuan felt that being with the two of them was like playing a zither to a cow. He felt depressed that no one was available to appreciate his splendor.</p>
<p>After waiting for an hour, the Myriad Buddha Cave was indeed restored to normal. The Golden Warriors also returned to their original states. The three of them rushed out together and did not waste time with the Golden Warriors.</p>
<p>After getting Fang Ruoxi and Tian Xiangdong together, the five of them filled out an application form and returned to wait for the news after the submission. The school said that the club would be approved within a week.</p>
<p>Li Xuan told them to leave the matter to him and that Zhou Wen didn’t need to worry about it. Their Xuanwen Club would get the approval tomorrow.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no plans on bothering with it anyway. He planned on heading home to game, but unfortunately, he bumped into Wang Fei and was taken to her office.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, have you considered the matter that I mentioned previously?” Wang Fei asked.</p>
<p>“Ms. Wang, I already said that I won’t avoid it.” It wasn’t that Zhou Wen insisted on fighting John, but that he had nowhere to go.</p>
<p>“Alright, since you’re so insistent, I won’t persuade you any further. In light of how you might be representing the school in battle, you can bring up anything that you need now. The college will try its best to support you,” said Wang Fei.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said, “I want the entry pass to Tiger Cage Pass and Lotus Flower Cave. I wonder if it’s possible?”</p>
<p>“Of course, that’s not a problem. If you need anything, I can help you apply for a few more passes,” Wang Fei agreed readily.</p>
<p>Wang Fei felt gratified. Although Zhou Wen had almost no chance of defeating John, it was still worth it if this could stir up Zhou Wen’s fighting spirit.</p>
<p>“That’s even better. Thank you, Ms. Wang.” Zhou Wen expressed his gratitude.</p>
<p>He didn’t really wish to enter to train himself with the pass, but to find a reasonable excuse for future summonings of the Demonized General and using of the Primordial Energy Skills.</p>
<p>“There’s no failure when you’re young. The most important thing is not to leave any regrets. Work hard and don’t make yourself regret in the future.” Before Zhou Wen left, Wang Fei even encouraged him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that Counselor Wang Fei was really a nice person, but she was just too naggy.</p>
<p>That afternoon, Wang Fei sent a few permit passes to Zhou Wen. Apart from Tiger Cage Pass and Lotus Flower Cave, there were several other dimensional zones that had been closed by the school-ones that the typical student wasn’t able to enter.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen had obtained the passes, he went to Tiger Cage Pass first.</p>
<p>He did enter Tiger Cage Pass, but he didn’t kill any monsters. He killed Demonized Soldiers for a while before finding a spot without any Demonized Soldiers. Coincidentally, there was an old, broken-down tank there. He lay down in it and continued to use his phone to grind.</p>
<p>There were many black-winged flying ants outside Ant City. They were Legendary creatures, and their combat ability was similar to the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. However, they were not as agile as the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned Truth Listener, the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, and the Mutated Demonized General in their Companion Beast form. Together with the blood-colored avatar, they charged towards Ant City.</p>
<p>The Mutated Demonized General charged forward as the Silver-Winged Flying Ant flew in the air. Behind it were the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant and Truth Listener. The blood-colored avatar was in the middle, sending the grinding team into the black-winged ants.</p>
<p>Despite being at the Legendary stage, Zhou Wen’s few Companion Beasts were much more ferocious than the black-winged flying ants. With one charge of the Mutated Demonized General and a cleave of the strange spear in its hand, it killed several black-winged flying ants.</p>
<p>The lotus flower above the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant’s head spewed out large amounts of red lotus seed bullets. The black-winged flying ants that were hit by the lotus seed bullets immediately corroded away, losing their ability to fly. After landing on the ground, their combat strength decreased drastically and they were beheaded by Truth Listener’s tiny claws.</p>
<p>What shocked Zhou Wen the most was Truth Listener. Despite its tiny size-less than the size of a palm-its claws were like a ghostly claw that could lop off a black-winged flying ant’s head with one strike.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that it would be a bitter fight, but now he realized that he didn’t need to do a thing. All he needed to do was follow behind to pick up the items.</p>
<p>The four Companion Beasts charged forward, and from time to time, he would hear a chime. Quite a number of dimensional crystals dropped on the ground, and even a black-winged flying ant’s Companion Egg dropped.</p>
<h3 id='chapter140'>Chapter 140 Golden Ant Honey</h3>
<p>Picking up things from behind his Companion Beasts made Zhou Wen feel guilty of reaping the fruits of success without putting in any effort.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder so many people wanted to be a general in ancient times. With a bunch of lackeys sweeping through everything, it’s truly a pleasure to reap the spoils. In a blink of an eye, he threw away the guilt he felt and continued picking things up without any qualms.</p>
<p>17-valued Strength dimensional crystal! Zhou Wen hurriedly picked it up and allowed the blood-colored avatar to absorb it, raising his Strength to 17. This was the highest attribute Zhou Wen currently possessed.</p>
<p>The dimensional crystals produced by Legendary creatures were commonly below 15 points. It was rare to see them above that. This was the first 17 points he had obtained.</p>
<p>Ever since Zhou Wen began grinding Legendary creatures, he hadn’t seen 20-valued dimensional crystals. This left him somewhat worried as to how he could raise his attributes to 21.</p>
<p>Based on his previous experience, he had to raise his attributes to the level of a Mythical creature like Truth Listener, so that he could advance to the next level.</p>
<p>All the attributes of Truth Listener at the Legendary stage were 21, so Zhou Wen naturally had to raise his attributes to 21.</p>
<p>As the four powerful Companion Beasts charged forward, the blood-colored avatar had already entered Ant City. Large numbers of ants immediately rushed out from the ant</p>
<p>nest.</p>
<p>These ants were different from the black-winged flying ants. There were red-armored ants and black-armored ants but most of them were yellow-armored ants. Their numbers were terrifying, but they couldn’t fly and could only attack on the ground.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar and the four Companion Beasts immediately plunged into the endless sea of ants. The previously ferocious Mutated Demonized General charged forward. Although it killed several ants, more surged forward and pulled it deep into the swamp-like sea of ants.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen realized that the situation was turning south, he made the blood-colored avatar jump onto the back of the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and fly straight into the sky before flying towards the middle of Ant City.</p>
<p>He let the Mutated Demonized General slow down the ant horde as much as it could.</p>
<p>Due to the large number of black-winged flying ants killed previously, there were very few ants that could fly after entering Ant City. Using the ant nest as an obstacle, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant dodged left and right, flitting through the air swiftly as it got closer and closer to the strange ant nest in the middle.</p>
<p>A black-winged flying ant charged forward, but the Silver-Winged Flying Ant was no longer capable of dodging. The blood-colored avatar struck out with Ashen Palm and struck the black-winged flying ant’s head. As though it had been struck dumb, it began flying in random directions before plummeting to the ground.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t use any other Primordial Energy Skills as their expenditure was too high, allowing him to only use them twice. Only Ashen Palm used a relatively lower amount of Primordial Energy. With Zhou Wen’s natural speed of Primordial Energy recovery, he could barely use it for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>However, that was only on the basis of occasional use. As the black-winged flying ants charging at him from his surroundings increased, Zhou Wen couldn’t even use his Ashen Palm.</p>
<p>Seeing that he was about to be surrounded by the black-winged flying ants, Zhou Wen looked at the distance between the blood-colored avatar and the ant nest. Gritting his teeth, he leaped from the back of the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and charged towards a black-winged flying ant. He took the opportunity to use Dragon Gate Fairy Skill to rush to the top of an ant nest by the side. He then used the momentum to rush straight to the highest spot where the nest was glowing with a golden halo.</p>
<p>In the nest behind him, several ants were leaping into the air in a bid to strike the blood-colored avatar. Thankfully, they were wingless red-armored ants. The blood-colored avatar circled the sky with the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill, causing the red-armored ants to miss and fall to the ground.</p>
<p>When the blood-colored avatar used the momentum to slide towards the golden ant nest, two black-winged flying ants rushed over from both sides.</p>
<p>The Silver-Winged Flying Ant had already been surrounded by a group of black-winged flying ants. Its wings had been ripped apart and it was being eaten. There was no way it could help him again.</p>
<p>The Dragon Gate Fairy Skill was only a movement technique and not a flight technique. As Zhou Wen’s strength had reached its limit and without anything to push off from, there was no way he could dodge the two black-winged flying ants’ attack.</p>
<p>Gritting his teeth, Zhou Wen thought of something. A green beam of light was summoned from the blood-colored avatar’s palm, transforming into a little fairy sitting on a banana leaf.</p>
<p>Before the fairy could see what was happening, the blood-colored avatar stepped on her banana leaf and leaped into the air again. However, the little fairy, along with the banana leaf, fell to the ground.</p>
<p>It was not easy for the little fairy to regain control of the banana leaf. Her ashen face was filled with anger. She pointed at the blood-colored avatar in the sky and yelled something</p>
<p>With this step, the blood-colored avatar finally managed to dodge the pounce of the two black-winged ants. Like a cannonball, it slammed into the shimmering golden ant nest.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The ant nest wasn’t as solid as Zhou Wen imagined. He had actually managed to open a huge hole as the blood-colored avatar rolled in with the mud walls.</p>
<p>The scene in the nest left Zhou Wen slightly taken aback. That so-called golden light wasn’t treasure.</p>
<p>The bottom half of the nest was filled with golden liquid, one that was sticky like glue.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen remembered hearing from others that some kinds of ants made honey like bees. Furthermore, these ants that could make honey were typically terrifying poison ants.</p>
<p>However, the honey they made was a tonic that was nourishing and even had medicinal value.</p>
<p>Of course, this was all hearsay. Zhou Wen was unsure of its authenticity, but the golden liquid in the nest seemed to be ant honey no matter how one looked at it.</p>
<p>After the blood-colored avatar entered the nest, it fell into a golden liquid. Immediately, it felt like it had fallen into a quagmire, so the more it struggled, the deeper it sank.</p>
<p>However, after the blood-colored avatar’s mouth was stained with the golden liquid, he felt a sweet fragrance entering his mouth. It made Zhou Wen even more certain that it was the legendary ant honey.</p>
<p>‘Consumed Golden Ant Honey, Primordial Energy+1.’ A notification notification popped up on his phone screen. It left Zhou Wen slightly taken aback before he became ecstatic.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to control the blood-colored avatar to drink a few mouthfuls, he suddenly heard an ear-piercing scream. When he looked up, he saw a flying ant that looked like it was cast from gold. It angrily flew down from the top of the nest and was as fast as a golden phantom.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was only able to see the Golden Flying Ant’s appearance when the blood-colored avatar was slain by a golden beam of light. Its head and body were separated.</p>
<p>However, the last thing he saw was something like a cocoon floating in thin air in the upper half of the nest. It was snow-white and crystalline, and he had no idea what it was.</p>
<p>Without even having the time to look at it, the phone screen went black.</p>
<p>Ants seem to be born from eggs, right? That thing was clearly a cocoon formed from thin silk. Could it be that ants in a dimensional dimension can reproduce? Zhou Wen found it odd. The aura from the cocoon seemed somewhat different from the Golden Flying Ant.</p>
<h3 id='chapter141'>Chapter 141 Strange Siblings</h3>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to drip his blood to revive and continue fighting, he suddenly heard a voice coming from afar. The sound became clearer as though someone was walking over.</p>
<p>“Brother, is that thing really inside Tiger Cage Pass?” A woman’s voice sounded. Although it wasn’t loud and was rather far away, Zhou Wen could still hear it clearly with Truth Listener’s ability.</p>
<p>“The most likely place is Tiger Cage Pass.” A man’s voice rang out.</p>
<p>“If that thing is really inside Tiger Cage Pass, with our abilities, we won’t be able to rush in at all. I’m afraid we’ve made a wasted trip,” the woman added.</p>
<p>“Not necessarily,” the man said with a laugh.</p>
<p>“The one in Tiger Cage Pass is not the usual person at the Epic stage. I’m afraid we won’t even be able to catch an arrow from him, so how can we rush in?” the woman said.</p>
<p>“Blindly charging in will definitely not work. However, I do know of a method that can allow us to enter.” The man paused before continuing, “There are three mutated Demonized Generals like Fist, Paper, and Blade in Tiger Cage Pass. If we can gather all three Demonized Generals’ skills, we can use them to get past that arrow. When the time comes, as long as we can get close enough to Tiger Cage Pass, we can enter it through that secret tunnel.”</p>
<p>“There aren’t many mutated Demonized Generals to begin with. It’s easier said than done to have one drop with all three skills,” said the woman.</p>
<p>“Let’s take it slow. After all, we still have to stay at Sunset College for two years. If we are lucky, we might be able to gather the three Primordial Energy Skills,” the man said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was lying in the broken-down tank and heard their conversation clearly. The duo talked as they walked and soon, they had gone some distance without discovering Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Those two must be Wu Jun and Wu Nan who were in the top ten, right? They actually know so much about Tiger Cage Pass and some secret tunnel? What’s the thing they were talking about? Zhou Wen could easily recognize them with Truth Listener’s ability.</p>
<p>However, the siblings’ behavior was somewhat odd.</p>
<p>However, none of this had anything to do with Zhou Wen. He continued to lay in the tank and grind away. He still wanted to enter the Golden Flying Ant’s nest to drink a few mouthfuls of the ant honey.</p>
<p>He had only taken a sip due to his lack of preparation the last time. Next time he felt that he would be able to fill his stomach.</p>
<p>However, through a great ordeal, when Zhou Wen finally arrived in front of the nest at the highest point, he saw a golden beam flash before he could enter. The golden flying ant charged out of the nest and killed the blood-colored avatar outside without giving him a chance to enter.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen refused to give up and tried again, but the result was the same. Without even having the chance to enter the nest, he was killed by the Golden Flying Ant.</p>
<p>How can this be? Logically speaking, the game’s program should be fixed. The first time I went there, the Golden Flying Ant was in the nest. It only took action after I rushed in. Why did it come out before the blood-colored avatar entered the nest during the second and third time? Zhou Wen felt depressed.</p>
<p>Drinking the Golden Ant Honey seemed hopeless, so all Zhou Wen could do was grind the other dungeons.</p>
<p>While grinding, Zhou Wen also headed to Myriad Buddha Cave to see if there were any Three-Eyed Golden Warriors.</p>
<p>There were Three-Eyed Golden Warriors, but they spawned at different locations every time which meant that it took Zhou Wen some time to find them.</p>
<p>The Mutated Demonized General led the way on a horse, blasting through the horde of Golden Warriors. This made Zhou Wen’s progress speed much faster.</p>
<p>After finding a Three-Eyed Golden Warrior, the Mutated Demonized General clashed head-on with it but failed to gain much of an advantage. However, it wasn’t placed at a disadvantage either.</p>
<p>The clash between the Golden Palm and Astral Fist was like a collision between Mars and Earth. The air blasts that produced were enough to send the Golden Warriors by the side flying</p>
<p>Although the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior was powerful, its Speed and means of attack were still inferior to the Mutated Demonized General.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Astral Suction Palm to help the Mutated Demonized General to kill the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior, which ended up dropping an 18-valued Constitution Crystal, raising Zhou Wen’s Constitution to 18 points.</p>
<p>Time passed as Zhou Wen grinded away, living a very regular lifestyle. He alternated between Tiger Cage Pass and Lotus Flower Cave on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Wang Fei was greatly gratified when she learned how hardworking Zhou Wen was. However, unbeknownst to her, Zhou Wen only found a place to game after entering the dimensional zones.</p>
<p>“Who’s that boy? Why haven’t I seen him before? He’s so handsome!” A few girls were walking in the school when they suddenly saw a boy walking over. After taking a closer look at his face, their eyes lit up.</p>
<p>“Really? Our school actually has such a handsome guy. Why didn’t we notice him in the past?” The girl’s eyes were almost fixed on him.</p>
<p>In their eyes, that boy was flawless from head to toe. His entire being seemed to be glowing.</p>
<p>When the boy saw them looking at him, he smiled at them. The girls’ hearts pounded wildly and they lowered their heads shyly, not daring to look at him again.</p>
<p>By the time they lifted their heads again, the boy had already disappeared.</p>
<p>“Damn it, I should have asked for his number just now.” A girl stamped her feet in regret.</p>
<p>“The door isn’t locked. Come in.” Wei Ge was clearing some student council work when he suddenly heard a knock on the door.</p>
<p>The door was pushed open, but Wei Ge felt that something was amiss. It was as if the person was not a member of the student council, so he looked up.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this, Wei Ge felt a sense of animosity.</p>
<p>The boy in front of him was his idea of the perfect man. He was elegant, mature, reliable, and had the aura of a nobleman. No one could ignore his existence with him merely standing there. It was as though he was the center of the world.</p>
<p>With just a glance, Wei Ge had already added the boy to the list of his opponents.</p>
<p>The boy reached out his hand and, in a friendly manner, said, “Hello, I’m John.”</p>
<p>“So it’s John. I’m the student council president of Sunset College, Wei Ge. I’ve already received notice from the school that I’ll be responsible for your daily life while you’re studying here.” Wei Ge stood up and reached out to shake John’s hand as their gaze met.</p>
<p>John’s gaze was as pure as a silent sea, without any ripples.</p>
<p>When their hands held each other, Wei Ge smiled as he secretly exerted strength in his palm. He wanted to test John’s strength.</p>
<p>Wei Ge had long heard that John had the title of Saint in the West district-he was a famous genius in the West district.</p>
<p>Wei Ge didn’t think that he would be any worse than John, but after his hand gradually tightened, his expression changed.</p>
<p>No matter how much Wei Ge exerted his strength, nothing happened to John’s palm. It remained warm and firm, as though strength couldn’t affect it at all. Even his expression was as gentle as ever.</p>
<p>Wei Ge felt that John was like an unfathomable ocean. No one knew how terrifying it was beneath the calm.</p>
<h3 id='chapter142'>Chapter 142 Saint John</h3>
<p>“John, welcome to Sunset College for your studies. I’ll take you to the dormitory first.” Wei Ge retracted his hand as his expression was a mixture of emotions.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll have to trouble you,” John said with a smile, “I heard that Sunset College produced a genius this year. A freshman who has yet to advance to the Legendary stage has managed to enter the top ten of the comprehensive test.”</p>
<p>Wei Ge was a shrewd person. Upon hearing John’s words, he immediately had a guess. Could it be that this John has a grudge with Zhou Wen?</p>
<p>Although he had such thoughts in mind, Wei Ge said, “I do indeed have such a junior. His talent and character are excellent.”</p>
<p>“I heard his name is Zhou Wen?” John asked again.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Do you know him?” Wei Ge asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know him. I heard that Sunset College has produced such a genius, so I’m looking forward to it. If there’s a chance, I hope I can spar with him.” John made his words very clear.</p>
<p>This only affirmed Wei Ge’s conjecture, but he avoided answering. He only smiled and said, “I’ll take you to the dormitory first. The school will arrange everything else.”</p>
<p>John nodded with a calm expression. He didn’t say anything further and instead chatted with Wei Ge about the glorious history and interesting news of Sunset College.</p>
<p>News of John coming to Sunset College quickly spread. Even if the school didn’t promote him, a tall, handsome, and outstanding student like John would easily attract attention once he appeared on campus.</p>
<p>“It’s as the rumors say, John is indeed a genius with both looks and strength. The reputation of a saint is true.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean ‘as the rumors say’? You haven’t seen his strength at all, have you? Maybe he’s just a pretty boy.”</p>
<p>“Generally, men who are good-looking can’t be too weak,” said a girl.</p>
<p>The students of Sunset College were discussing the genius student from the West district, especially the Cape family that had borne one of the six heroes. This gave him an even more mysterious halo.</p>
<p>Many of the experts in the school hoped to battle John, but this was not something they could sort for themselves. They had to follow the arrangements of the school’s leaders.</p>
<p>Sunset College had carefully selected a list of students to interact with John. There were five people, including Huang Ji, Wei Ge, Hui Haifeng, Wang Lu, and Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>In consideration of Zhou Wen’s relationship with Liz, he wasn’t put on the list.</p>
<p>When John saw the name list, he didn’t say anything. The corners of his mouth curled up and he revealed a rare smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had also heard the news of John’s arrival, but he didn’t take it to heart. With his present strength and his legendary Companion Beasts that possessed astonishing combat strength, it could be said that he wasn’t afraid of any cultivator of the same level. If John really wanted to fight him, he wouldn’t back down.</p>
<p>He continued persisting in his old ways by grinding daily. He obtained quite a number of dimensional crystals and Companion Beasts, and his attributes increased significantly. Apart from his Speed, the other attributes had increased to 18 points and his Speed was at 17 points.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t obtain any better excellent-grade Companion Beasts. Most of them were used as food to feed Truth Listener and Banana Fairy. He attempted to fuse a small number of them, but all of them failed. The success rate of the fusion was frighteningly low.</p>
<p>Providing plenty of food was clearly beneficial. After consuming a copious number of Legendary Companion Eggs, Banana Fairy finally began to evolve.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy didn’t undergo much of a change when she reached the Legendary stage. Her body was still small and petite, and she didn’t grow up at all. Instead, the banana leaf she was sitting on had enlarged but was merely the size of a palm.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy: Legendary (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life State: Great Yin Spirit Root.</p>
<p>Strength: 21</p>
<p>Speed: 21</p>
<p>Constitution: 21</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 21</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Grand Yin Wind</p>
<p>Companion Form: Fan</p>
<p>Apart from possessing a Life Providence, her attributes had grown to the same level as Truth Listener’s. There were no changes in other aspects, with her only skill being Grand Yin Wind.</p>
<p>The Great Yin Spirit Root seemed to have a certain augmentation effect on the Grand Yin Wind. Zhou Wen tested the power of the Grand Yin Wind in-game and with a gentle flap, he sent several black-winged flying ants flying tens of feet away. Furthermore, the wind caused their bodies to be covered in frost, to the point of nearly being frozen into ice sculptures and losing all their combat strength. They were so stiff that they curled into a ball and trembled.</p>
<p>What a potent Grand Yin Wind. Unfortunately, I can only use it once. Zhou Wen realized that the Grand Yin Wind was completely uncontrollable. If he used it once, it would absorb all his Primordial Energy at once without leaving him a single drop.</p>
<p>After advancing to the Legendary stage, Truth Listener and the Banana Fairy became restless. Zhou Wen often sensed their thoughts, hoping that he could release them.</p>
<p>When there was no one around, Zhou Wen would release them to allow them to take a breather. Truth Listener was rather well-behaved. He crouched beside Zhou Wen and pricked up his four ears to listen to him. It was unknown what he was listening to.</p>
<p>However, Banana Fairy wasn’t that well-behaved. She flew around like a fly on the banana leaf, her mouth smacking away, saying something completely indecipherable.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen didn’t have any other advantages but being sufficiently focused, no matter how noisy the tiny Banana Fairy was beside him, he didn’t seem to hear her. He continued gaming without being affected.</p>
<p>Wang Fei was originally worried that John would cause trouble for Zhou Wen, but John didn’t seem to have any objections to the list of people. Nor did he mention Zhou Wen, as though he had no idea that Zhou Wen existed.</p>
<p>In just three or four days after arriving at Sunset College, John received unanimous praise from the students, especially the female students. They almost thought John was their Prince Charming.</p>
<p>During his sparring; John battled Wei Ge to a tie with his sword techniques, he tied with Hui Haifeng with his melee combat skills, his saber techniques were comparable to Feng Qiuyan’s, and his skills of alacrity were no weaker than Wang Lu’s.</p>
<p>Apart from not really fighting Huang Ji, John and the other four top students of Sunset College were tied. Although they didn’t win, they didn’t lose either.</p>
<p>However, many students believed that John was stronger because he had never used Holy Light Judgment, the Primordial Energy Skill he used to obtain the title of Saint.</p>
<p>A Primordial Energy Skill like the Holy Light Judgment was not something that could be learned with a dimensional crystal. Before that, one had to possess a Covenant Royale physique of the Cape family-one of the six heroes—to absorb the Primordial Energy Skill Crystal needed to master the terrifying Primordial Energy Skill like Holy Light Judgment.</p>
<p>In just a few days, John became synonymous with the words “humility,” “elegance,” “nobility,” and “gentlemanly.” Even Wei Ge, who was popular with female students, was overshadowed by John.</p>
<h3 id='chapter143'>Chapter 143 Dragon Gate Twenty Pieces</h3>
<p>“Zhou Wen, be careful. That John is terrifying,” Li Xuan said to Zhou Wen with a heavy expression when he arrived at his dorm one night.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Zhou Wen looked at Li Xuan in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Don’t you find it strange? He definitely knows about you and Liz, but he hasn’t mentioned it in the past four days in school. Don’t you think this person is too sinister?” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it better if he doesn’t mention it?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Not mentioning it doesn’t mean he won’t cause trouble for you. Anyway, I think there’s something fishy. You have to be careful and don’t fall into his trap. By the way, it’s best you don’t agree to spar with him. Do you know what Wei Ge said about him?” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“I don’t,” Zhou Wen said with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>“Unfathomable,” Li Xuan said before continuing, “Although Wei Ge’s character isn’t great, he’s still quite powerful. If even someone like him views John as unfathomable,</p>
<p>st mean that John’s strength is really terrifying. Unless necessary, it’s best not to fight him.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll remember that.” Zhou Wen nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>As long as John didn’t make trouble for him, he didn’t plan on fighting him.</p>
<p>When it comes to fighting, how can it be more fun than killing monsters in games? It’s not like fighting people can drop equipment or pets, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>After sending Li Xuan off, Zhou Wen continued gaming while lying in bed. When Zhou Wen entered Myriad Buddha Cave again, he killed another Three-Eyed Golden Warrior and actually had a Companion Egg drop.</p>
<p>My Three-Eyed Golden Warrior Companion Egg has finally returned. Zhou Wen was delighted as he hurriedly checked its attributes.</p>
<p>Three-Eyed Golden Warrior: Legendary</p>
<p>Life State: Golden Body</p>
<p>Strength: 18</p>
<p>Speed: 14</p>
<p>Constitution: 18</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 17</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Invulnerable Golden Body, Golden Palm, Golden Fiendtamer Fist.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Golden Silk Soft Armor</p>
<p>This Three-Eyed Golden Warrior was actually a rare Companion Beast with three skills. Furthermore, its attributes were even better than Li Xuan’s. It was basically maxed out.</p>
<p>The Three-Eyed Golden Warrior’s Speed wasn’t fast to begin with, so 14 points was its limit. Li Xuan’s was only at 13, even slower than Zhou Wen’s. Its Strength and Primordial Energy were slightly lower than Zhou Wen’s, with only Constitution being equal.</p>
<p>Although its attributes were inferior to his Demonized General, its Golden Body Life Providence made it hardier than the Demonized General. It was an excellent-grade meat shield pet.</p>
<p>With the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior tanking any attacks up ahead, it gave Zhou Wen much more space to maneuver.</p>
<p>As for the Golden Fiendtamer Fist, it seemed to be weaker than Golden Palm, but something was better than nothing.</p>
<p>The Xuanwen Club was finally officially established. In order to celebrate the birth of the club, Li Xuan organized his first club activity and gathered all the members together. He planned on having a training event at a dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Although Gu Dian was only a member in name, Li Xuan still sent him a message, hoping that he might participate.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan never expected him to join them, but to their surprise, Gu Dian actually came.</p>
<p>“Are you going to Dragon Gate Grotto’s Ancient Yang Cave?” asked Gu Dian.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Shall we go together?” Li Xuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Gu Dian nodded slightly before standing to the side without speaking to anyone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan had roughly understood his personality, so they didn’t mind. After getting Fang Ruoxi and Tian Xiangdong, the five of them set off towards Ancient Yang Cave at Dragon Gate Grotto.</p>
<p>Ancient Yang Cave was considered one of the more famous caves in Dragon Gate Grotto. The famous ancient tablets from the Wei dynastythe Dragon Gate Twenty Pieces-consisted of twenty items. And nineteen of them were in the Ancient Yang Cave.</p>
<p>After it became a dimensional zone, the Dragon Gate Nineteen Pieces also underwent changes, giving birth to a Legendary creature, the Mounted Tablet Beast.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s organization of the club activity was to hunt the Mounted Tablet Beast together.</p>
<p>Mounted Tablet Beasts looked extremely odd. It was a stone turtle that carried a stone tablet on its back. It moved very slowly, but its body was extremely hard. It was like a Golden Warrior, a Legendary creature that was extremely difficult to kill.</p>
<p>The only difference was that no one liked to kill Golden Warriors. However, Mounted Tablet Beasts were popular for hunting because although it was difficult to kill, they dropped excellent Primordial Energy Skills. Furthermore, the drop rate was rather high.</p>
<p>According to the differences in the words written on the tablet, there were a total of nineteen types. Every Mounted Tablet Beast had a special Primordial Energy Skill. There were nineteen types that could drop and each one had their own uses and was deeply loved by the students.</p>
<p>As too many students hunted Mounted Tablet Beasts, the school had no choice but to limit entry into the Ancient Yang Cave. They had to have a permit to enter freely.</p>
<p>After Li Xuan used some connections, he obtained the pass to Ancient Yang Cave and organized this event.</p>
<p>There were too many small dungeons in Dragon Gate Grotto. Although Zhou Wen knew of the existence of Ancient Yang Cave, he had never been to it in-game.</p>
<p>Originally he was not interested in the Cave, but he still had to participate in the club’s events. Hence, he went along with Li Xuan and company.</p>
<p>The Buddha statues and Buddhist shrines in the Ancient Yang Cave were dazzling. Just as they entered, they saw a moving stone pillar. On careful look, it was a giant turtle carrying a stone tablet crawling on the ground.</p>
<p>“Let me repeat again. When killing the Mounted Tablet Beast, make sure not to touch the Buddha statues or the Buddhist shrines. Otherwise, no one can save you if something bad happens,” Li Xuan exhorted again.</p>
<p>“Brother Li, don’t worry. We know the rules. We guarantee that we won’t break them,” Tian Xiangdong said as he patted his chest.</p>
<p>“That’s good. After all, there’s not much danger in Ancient Yang Cave. The Mounted Tablet Beast crawls very slowly. As long as you don’t court death, it probably won’t be able to harm you. Everyone split up and do whatever you need to do. You can all find Mounted Tablet Beasts for yourselves.” Li Xuan immediately began as he charged towards the Mounted Tablet Beast.</p>
<p>Gu Dian and Fang Ruoxi went in different directions to search for the Mounted Tablet Beasts hidden in the Ancient Yang Cave.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen stood rooted to the ground as he watched Li Xuan attack the Mounted Tablet Beast. At the same time, he looked at the stone tablet text on the back of the Mounted Tablet Beast.</p>
<p>The words on the tablet danced and moved in a strange way. The strokes were full, straight, and filled with spirituality. It had an unbound beauty.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know calligraphy, but when he saw the words on the tablet, he thought of the mysterious stone monuments he had seen.</p>
<p>The stone tablet on the back of the Mounted Tablet Beast couldn’t match the mysterious stone monuments Zhou Wen had seen. Nor did it have any mysterious power lingering on. It was likely something ordinary.</p>
<p>However, after reading through the information regarding Ancient Yang Cave, Zhou Wen’s heart stirred. The species of the Mounted Tablet Beast corresponds to the Dragon Gate Nineteen Pieces. Does that mean that at the last piece of the Dragon Gate Twenty Pieces, there’s a corresponding dimensional creature and Primordial Energy Skill? But why haven’t I heard of any other Mounted Tablet Beasts outside the Ancient Yang Cave?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen checked the information regarding the Dragon Gate Twenty Pieces and discovered that nineteen of them were in Ancient Yang Cave. Only one piece was located outside Old Dragon Cave at Cixiang Kiln.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but recall something. Wang Lu had previously mentioned that one could hear a dragon’s roar near Old Dragon Cave and that there was a treasure halo that appeared at night. Apparently, it was close to Cixiang Kiln.</p>
<h3 id='chapter144'>Chapter 144 Rising Sun Monument</h3>
<p>It killed Wei Ge to meet John again, but he had no choice but to take him around to experience campus life at Sunset College.</p>
<p>In the past, Wei Ge had been the center of attention wherever he went. He had been the target of all the girls’ passionate gazes. But with John by his side, Wei Ge felt as if his brilliance had been completely overshadowed.</p>
<p>He felt it now as they were touring the campus. There was a large group of girls following them, however, the girls who used to only have eyes for him were now staring unblinkingly at John. Their eyes were almost in the shapes of hearts.</p>
<p>“Is this Sunset College’s Rising Sun Monument?” John stood in front of a monument made of white jade and stared at the rows of names on it.</p>
<p>“That’s right. This is the Rising Sun Monument. The names of the top ten students of each year’s comprehensive test are engraved on it as a way to inspire future students. If they make it onto the rankings several times, there will be a star-shaped mark beside their names. The number of stars tells you how many times the student has had their name appear on the Rising Sun Monument while schooling,” said Wei Ge proudly.</p>
<p>He had been on the rankings ever since he was in his sophomore year. Together with the current year, he had already been on the rankings twice. He was bound to appear on the rankings next year, in his final year.</p>
<p>Only a small group of elites in Sunset College attained such rankings for three consecutive years. This was an illustrious result that one could be proud of.</p>
<p>“President Wei’s cultivation is superb and his sword skills are peerless. I guess you definitely make it onto the rankings?” John asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“I was lucky enough to get on the rankings twice.” Wei Ge pointed at his name on the monument.</p>
<p>“Hui Haifeng, Feng Qiuyan, and Wang Lu are both highly talented, so they should be on this list, right?” John asked again.</p>
<p>“Indeed. They were in the top ten in the comprehensive test this year.” Wei Ge pointed them out one by one, but he could already feel that something was amiss.</p>
<p>“Eh, that’s weird.” John looked at the Sun Rise Monument and suddenly exclaimed in surprise.</p>
<p>Wei Ge had already realized something as he shot a look at John. However, he didn’t follow up on the topic, as if he hadn’t heard John’s words of surprise.</p>
<p>Although Wei Ge didn’t respond, one of the girls following them asked, “What’s so strange, John?”</p>
<p>Wei Ge wanted nothing more than to give the girl a slap, thinking that this woman was truly stupid.</p>
<p>John pointed at the name on the monument and said, “President Wei, you and the others are all elite talents, being able to advance to the Legendary stage before reaching twenty. It’s not surprising that you could make the rankings. However, on this entire Rising Sun Monument, other than one person, all of them are at the Legendary stage. Why is this person’s name on it despite being only at the Mortal stage?”</p>
<p>“The person you’re talking about is Zhou Wen, right? Although he is only at the Mortal stage, his strength is indeed astonishing. He obtained the stunning results of three perfect scores and one short of perfect at nine during the comprehensive test. He’s indeed a genius, so it’s not surprising that he made the rankings,” the girl from before added.</p>
<p>John pulled up the corners of his mouth and looked at Zhou Wen’s name on the monument. “I never expected such a genius to exist in this world. To be able to enter the top ten of Sunset College’s comprehensive test at the Mortal stage makes him a truly rare sight. Since I’m here at Sunset College, I have to see him for myself. Otherwise, wouldn’t this be a longing regret?”</p>
<p>Wei Ge’s expression changed slightly before it immediately reverted to its original state. He looked at John and said, “Zhou Wen is indeed a genius. However, he’s still at the Mortal stage. It’s probably not appropriate for you to spar with him, right?”</p>
<p>Although Wei Ge didn’t have a good impression of Zhou Wen, as the student council president of Sunset College, he still stood in the position of upholding the school’s reputation.</p>
<p>John said indifferently, “President Wei, that’s not right. There were many experts at Sunset College’s comprehensive test. Even the top twenty-three are probably Legendary experts. For a Mortal stage to be able to defeat so many Legendary experts, and for you, President Wei, Feng Qiuyan, and company, to be similarly ranked in the top ten, isn’t it odd that you’re now telling me that he doesn’t have the ability to fight someone at the Legendary stage? Could it be that Zhou Wen’s results weren’t obtained by his strength alone? If that’s the case, I suggest that his name be promptly removed from the Rising Sun Monument, lest it mars the reputation of Sunset College. Those not in the know might even come to the impression that students of Sunset College only know how to cheat.”</p>
<p>Wei Ge’s expression changed as he replied firmly, “Zhou Wen’s results are real. Students from Sunset College never cheat.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I would like to see how this Mortal stage genius managed to enter the top ten of the comprehensive test…” John said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was gaming on his bed when he suddenly heard his phone ring. When he saw that it was a call from Li Xuan, he chose to answer.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, bad news. That bastard John is too sinister.” Li Xuan’s resentful voice sounded.</p>
<p>“Calm down. What happened? Tell me slowly.” Zhou Wen wasn’t flustered at all.</p>
<p>“That bastard is standing in front of the Rising Sun Monument…” Li Xuan recounted what had happened and continued anxiously, “This matter has blown up quite a bit. The school doesn’t have a way out, so this matter probably won’t be easy to settle.”</p>
<p>“Got it.” When Zhou Wen heard the doorbell ring, he said to Li Xuan, “Someone’s pressing the doorbell. It might be Ms. Wang Fei. I’ll talk to you later.”</p>
<p>“What do you plan on doing?” Li Xuan asked again.</p>
<p>“What else can I do if others come knocking at my door?” Zhou Wen hung up after saying that.</p>
<p>Opening the door, it was indeed Wang Fei. She looked at Zhou Wen and sighed. “Zhou Wen…”</p>
<p>Just as she said that, Zhou Wen cut her off. “Ms. Wang, I can fight. Take me there.”</p>
<p>Wang Fei was stunned. Seeing Zhou Wen’s indifferent expression, as though he had already made a decision, she still asked, “Have you decided?”</p>
<p>“Yes, don’t worry. Even if I can’t win, I definitely won’t embarrass the school,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Just do your best.” Wang Fei didn’t believe that Zhou Wen could defeat John. If possible, she would rather Zhou Wen not fight.</p>
<p>However, the matter had blown up so much that it might even affect the reputation of Sunset College. Regardless of whether it was victory or defeat, Zhou Wen needed to step forward to battle John.</p>
<p>The school held no hopes of Zhou Wen defeating John. They only hoped that he wouldn’t lose too terribly so that they could have a chance of spinning it in a better light.</p>
<p>Wang Fei didn’t wish for Zhou Wen to fight, afraid that the positive attitude he had recently established would crumble from the beating.</p>
<p>John’s family background was better than An Jing’s. His achievements were not much worse than An Jing’s, and might even be better.</p>
<p>Back then, Zhou Wen didn’t even manage to withstand a single blow from An Jing. This time, the outcome wasn’t optimistic either.</p>
<h3 id='chapter145'>Chapter 145 Ten Minutes</h3>
<p>“Since you are doubting the standards of our Sunset College students, I’ll fight you.” A cold voice was heard in front of the Rising Sun Monument. Everyone turned their heads and saw the deadpan An Jing approach John.</p>
<p>John said with a smile, “Miss An, I believe you are mistaken. I’m not doubting Sunset College’s teaching ability or strength of its students. I’m very respectful to students like President Wei, Hui Haifeng, Feng Qiuyan, Wang Lu, and you, Miss An. All of you are truly capable students. As for Zhou Wen, I was originally very respectful to him. I wanted to get to know this rare genius, but your attitude has left me somewhat puzzled. This matter had nothing to do with me to begin with, but since I’m an exchange student here at Sunset College, I’m considered part of it during this period of time. I don’t wish for the college’s reputation to be sullied.”</p>
<p>“You don’t dare to fight me?” She stared at John quietly.</p>
<p>John continued with a smile. “Miss An, are you upholding Zhou Wen’s honor or Sunset College’s? Could it be that this Zhou Wen is truly lacking in strength and cheated to obtain a spot that should have belonged to another student?”</p>
<p>John’s doubts caused the students of Sunset College who were watching to whisper amongst themselves. Clearly, everyone became suspicious.</p>
<p>Previously, when Zhou Wen obtained the spot, there were already people who suspected him. However, there was no evidence back then, so no one mentioned it. Now that John mentioned it, the previous suspicions were magnified.</p>
<p>“There’s absolutely no such thing. Our Sunset College categorically forbids cheating. Once they are discovered, they are immediately expelled,” an official from the college hurriedly explained. However, no matter what he said, he was unable to dispel the suspicions of those students.</p>
<p>“Unless Zhou Wen comes out to fight me to prove to everyone that he isn’t any worse than the other students in the top ten, it’s hardly convincing,” John said with a smile.</p>
<p>“How shall it be proven? By defeating you?” An Jing was about to say something when she suddenly heard a voice.</p>
<p>Everyone turned their heads and saw Zhou Wen walk over and stand in front of the Rising Sun Monument.</p>
<p>“It might be a little too harsh on you to talk about defeating me. Weapons or empty-handed, strength, speed, and endurance, or even if it’s a battle of Companion Beasts, you can choose any one type. As long as you can last ten minutes without being defeated, it’s your win.” John was forcing Zhou Wen to have no way out.</p>
<p>“That bastard John is so sinister,” Li Xuan cursed under his breath.</p>
<p>Now, he finally understood why John hadn’t directly challenged Zhou Wen when he first came to the college. His intentions were extremely sinister.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen were to fight John as one of the students who interacted with him in the beginning, he could just admit defeat if he wasn’t his match.</p>
<p>But now that things had reached this stage, if Zhou Wen couldn’t hold on for more than ten minutes, not only would Zhou Wen lose face, but even Sunset College’s reputation would be tarnished.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen had to persist for ten minutes regardless. And in these ten minutes, John could do whatever he wanted.</p>
<p>John definitely wouldn’t dare kill Zhou Wen at Sunset College, but he could teach him a lesson that he would never forget.</p>
<p>An Jing naturally saw through John’s intentions and said to Zhou Wen, “Zhou Wen, you don’t need to prove anything to others.”</p>
<p>“Since you are so lacking in confidence, how about this? I won’t do a thing. As long as you can last ten minutes without being defeated in front of one of my Companion Beasts, I’ll count it as you winning. How can a top ten student of Sunset College’s comprehensive test not be able to complete such a simple matter?” John looked at Zhou Wen mockingly.</p>
<p>“Ten minutes?” Zhou Wen asked John.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Just ten minutes.” John couldn’t help but smile when he saw Zhou Wen about to agree.</p>
<p>“Ten minutes is too long.” Zhou Wen shook his head.</p>
<p>“Oh, then how long do you think you can last?” John looked at Zhou Wen with piqued interest. It was beyond his expectations that Zhou Wen was actually showing signs of weakness in front of so many people.</p>
<p>“One minute.” Zhou Wen thought seriously before giving a number.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s words, the surrounding Sunset College students felt ashamed. After all, Zhou Wen was in the top ten of the comprehensive test, so for him to admit that he could only last a minute in front of John’s Companion Beast was a disgrace to Sunset College.</p>
<p>“A minute is indeed short, but since you have spoken, let’s do it,” John said with a smile that had no mirth in it.</p>
<p>John thought to himself, Even if it’s only a minute, I can still cripple you. How dare you treat my sister that way. I will definitely settle this score with you.</p>
<p>There were special combat grounds in the school. Under the guidance of the college staff, the two of them arrived at the venue.</p>
<p>This matter had long spread across Sunset College. Many students had come to watch, but there were very few counselors. Apart from Wang Fei and a few other counselors and staff who maintained order at the scene, there was basically no sight of the college’s upper management.</p>
<p>The college’s upper management could roughly guess how Zhou Wen had entered the top ten. However, they didn’t hold it against him because of the An family. From their point of view, Zhou Wen was bound to lose to John in combat, so no one wanted to embarrass themselves here.</p>
<p>“Will Zhou Wen be alright?” Fang Ruoxi asked worriedly.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou will definitely be fine if it’s just a minute, but…” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“But what?” Fang Ruoxi asked.</p>
<p>“I have a nagging feeling that things aren’t that simple. Old Zhou’s personality seems mild and uncompetitive, but he’s a very proud person deep down. He shouldn’t…” Li Xuan didn’t continue.</p>
<p>When Li Xuan saw Feng Qiuyan sitting by the side, he asked, “Little Feng, you fought with John. What are your thoughts?”</p>
<p>“John is very strong, a minute will be very difficult,” Feng Qiuyan said.</p>
<p>Li Xuan, Fang Ruoxi, and Tian Xiangdong were alarmed. Tian Xiangdong said in disbelief, “Is John so strong that Zhou Wen won’t even last a minute?”</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan said calmly, “It’s indeed difficult to defeat John in a minute, but Coach might have his own ideas.”</p>
<p>Tian Xiangdong’s and Li Xuan’s mouths widened so much that an egg could be stuffed into them. They looked at Feng Qiuyan like he was an alien.</p>
<p>“Did I hear wrongly just now? Are you saying that Zhou Wen wants to defeat John in a minute? Is that what Zhou Wen meant by a minute?” Tian Xiangdong felt his mind become a mess.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan slapped his thigh. “I knew it. How could Old Zhou be so cowardly? That’s right, that must be the case.”</p>
<p>As the few of them spoke, John had already summoned his Companion Beast. Many of the onlookers shouted its name when they saw it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter146'>Chapter 146 One Minute Is Too Long</h3>
<p>“Knight of the Round Table!” Li Xuan cried out softly when he saw John summon his Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Among the many dimensional zones in the West district, Camelot was undoubtedly one of the most famous.</p>
<p>There was only one dimensional creature in Camelot—the legendary Knights of the Round Table. They were rare in number, and each one of them had different abilities.</p>
<p>To be able to obtain a Knight of the Round Table Companion Beast was like a dream to Legendary cultivators in the West district.</p>
<p>In the West district, a Knight of the Round Table Companion Beast was synonymous with being invincible at the Legendary stage. It was not only because they were powerful, but also because of another important reason: Other than a Knight of the Round Table’s own abilities, they were also one of the few Companion Beasts who could be augmented by their owner’s strength.</p>
<p>The more powerful the person with a Knight of the Round Table was, the more it boosted the Knight. This made him almost invincible at the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>There was a very famous West district expert who had used Galahad of the Knights of the Round Table to be unparalleled in Companion Beast combat in the West district.</p>
<p>John’s Knight was riding a black horse, carrying a steel spear that made him look extremely majestic. He wore a medal signifying his status as a knight of the Round Table.</p>
<p>“That’s Holy Spear Knight of the Knights of the Round Table. Legend has it that he corresponds to the Round Table knight, Lamorak. He’s one of the three most powerful Round Table knights. His usage of spears is nearly invincible. He once defeated thirty knights single-handedly and is an extremely powerful Legendary Companion Beast. With John’s augmentation of the Round Table knight, it wouldn’t be too much to say that he’s one of the strongest Companion Beasts at the Legendary stage.” Wang Lu identified the Round Table knight’s origins.</p>
<p>“Is Zhou Wen alright?” Li Xuan began to worry. It wouldn’t be easy for Zhou Wen to defeat such a powerful Companion Beast in a minute.</p>
<p>Wang Fei was also astonished when she saw the Holy Spear Knight.</p>
<p>There were very few dimensional creatures in Camelot, so the number of Companion Beasts produced was limited. Every Round Table knight’s owner was very famous, so it was unexpected for John to have one.</p>
<p>However, Round Table knights were usually one of a kind. She had never heard of two Round Table knights appearing at the same time. According to what she knew, the Holy Spear Knight originally belonged to an Epic expert in the West district, but now, it was appearing with John.</p>
<p>Although Sunset College also produced knight-type Companion Beasts in the dimensional zones, they were naturally inferior to the world-renowned Knights of the Round Table.</p>
<p>John looked at Zhou Wen and said, “This is my Companion Beast Holy Spear Knight. He only has one active Primordial Energy Skill—Spear of the Holy Steed, but the might of this spear is nearly invincible amongst its peers. However, since you are one of the top ten students at Sunset College, it shouldn’t be difficult for you to last a minute under his spear, right?”</p>
<p>“Are… are you ready?” John narrowed his eyes and asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I’ll be done soon.” Zhou Wen had planned on using the banana fan to just blow away John’s Companion Beast, but after seeing the Holy Spear Knight, he dispelled the thought.</p>
<p>As he spoke, Zhou Wen extended his hand and beckoned. A crimson beam of light flew out, materializing in front of him to form a red-armored knight on a red horse. It was a mighty knight that resembled a devil.</p>
<p>“A Demonized General… No… It’s not an ordinary Demonized General. It’s a word-engraved Demonized General… Why is the word engraved on its helmet a little odd…?” The students from Sunset College immediately recognized the Mutated Demonized General and began stirring.</p>
<p>Even Wang Fei was somewhat surprised. Zhou Wen actually obtained a word-engraved Demonized General as a Companion Beast? Isn’t his luck too good? How many days has it been since he obtained the Tiger Cage Pass’s entry pass? He actually managed to have a Mutated Demonized General’s Companion Egg drop. Furthermore, that word-engraved Demonized General is a little odd. Why isn’t the helmet engraved with Blade, Paper, Fist, but Demon?</p>
<p>“F*ck, Old Zhou is amazing. He managed to obtain a Mutated Demonized General’s Companion Egg without anyone knowing. However, can itl beat a Holy Spear Knight?” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. In theory, Holy Spear Knight should be stronger. After all, he can be augmented by his owner’s power. In contrast, the Mutated Demonized General doesn’t have this ability. He can only rely on himself,” said Wang Lu in thought.</p>
<p>“I’m ready now,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“A knight versus a knight? That’s interesting. I’ll show you what a real knight is.” John proudly raised his finger and gently swiped it. “The time starts now.”</p>
<p>As though he had received an emperor’s order, the Holy Spear Knight lifted up his spear and launched an attack at Zhou Wen and the Mutated Demonized General.</p>
<p>As the charge increased in speed, a terrifying spear beam emitted from the Holy Spear Knight’s spear. The spear beam pierced through the air, and formed a swirl that was visible to the naked eye. It was like a hurricane that effused a terrifying holy luster that charged at the Mutated Demonized General.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t make any moves as the Mutated Demonized General charged out as well. The red-armored spear was like a red flame.</p>
<p>The white and red horses charged forward at the same time, like two hurricanes sweeping through the battlefield, hitting each other in an instant.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The red spear clashed with the holy spear. The terrifying power tore through the air, creating a piercing explosion.</p>
<p>This strike was actually a tie. John couldn’t help but frown slightly as he couldn’t accept the outcome.</p>
<p>The Holy Spear Knight failed to gain the upper hand despite being augmented by his powers. It left him somewhat astonished by the power of the Mutated Demonized General.</p>
<p>The spectating students were also excited. The Mutated Demonized General was actually on par with the famous Knight of the Round Table. It made them yearn for one and wished that they could head over to Tiger Cage Pass to have a Mutated Demonized General’s Companion Egg drop.</p>
<p>However, just as everyone thought that the clash had ended, the Mutated Demonized General’s other hand clenched into a fist and bombarded the Holy Spear Knight.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Under everyone’s shocked gaze, the Holy Spear Knight’s body was sent flying from the horse’s back. He flew more than ten meters before landing on the ground. The knight lost grip of his spear as it fell far away. The heavy armor on his chest also cracked, while his helmet rolled to the side.</p>
<p>Before the Holy Spear Knight could stand up again, the Mutated Demonized General on the horse that resembled a devil, struck out with another palm. A blood-red saber beam slashed through the air, chopping off the Holy Spear Knight’s head.</p>
<p>Everything happened in the blink of an eye, so fast that everyone stared in shock. Even John himself had yet to react. His Holy Spear Knight had been killed the moment the face-off began.</p>
<p>“One minute… From the looks of it, it’s still too long…” Zhou Wen looked at the Holy Spear Knight’s corpse and spoke without expression.</p>
<h3 id='chapter147'>Chapter 147 Rebellious Knight</h3>
<p>“What’s that? Was I seeing things? That Mutated Demonized General seems to have used two Primordial Energy Skills of fist and blade at the same time, am I right? Is there such a Demonized General?” A student from Sunset College stared at the scene with widened eyes.</p>
<p>“Haha, what Knight of the Round Table. He’s far inferior to our Demonized General.”</p>
<p>“Ten minutes was indeed too long. A minute was too long as well. What Zhou Wen said was right. Haha.”</p>
<p>“I knew it. How could someone from Sunset College cheat? Zhou Wen’s results must be real. With this Companion Beast, he’s qualified to be in the top ten.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t Zhou Wen at the Mortal stage? Can a Mortal stage use a Legendary Companion Beast?”</p>
<p>As the students were in a flurry of discussion, Wang Fei wore an odd look as well. What’s going on with that Demonized General? It has both fist and blade techniques. Is this another mutation of the Mutated Demonized General?</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, amazing. The Mutated Demonized General is truly powerful,” Li Xuan said with a laugh.</p>
<p>John’s eyes narrowed as he stared at Zhou Wen and said slowly, “Sunset College is indeed worthy of its reputation. I’ve underestimated you. I lost just now. You have the right to fight me. Do you dare fight me seriously in battle?”</p>
<p>“Tch, I thought a saint from the West district would be impressive. So they are just people who can’t afford to lose,” Li Xuan curled his lips and said disdainfully.</p>
<p>“John, you’ve already lost,” An Jing said coldly.</p>
<p>John remained unmoved as he continued staring at Zhou Wen. “Are you afraid of accepting the real challenge?”</p>
<p>“You’ve already lost. I’m not interested in people who have been previously defeated,” Zhou Wen said calmly before turning to leave.</p>
<p>John’s expression turned ugly as he clenched his fists tightly and stared intently at Zhou Wen’s back. “Do you dare to fight me with the Cape family’s honor on the line as well as this Rebellious Knight Companion Egg?”</p>
<p>Those who had heard of the name Rebellious Knight were alarmed. Even Zhou Wen stopped in his tracks and turned to look at John.</p>
<p>“The Rebellious Knight you mentioned is the one that’s strongest among the Knights of the Round Table?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“That’s right. The most powerful Knight of the Round Table-Lancelot. If you can defeat me, you can have him.” John took out a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>The egg emitted resplendent holy light and the flawless shell that resembled jade had the marks of a sword and shield.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared at the Companion Egg and was truly tempted.</p>
<p>Lancelot was known as the strongest Round Table knight, but it was also because of his existence that it fractured the Knights of the Round Table and the legend of King Arthur.</p>
<p>He was somewhat similar to a General Lu Bu in the history of East district. They were all tragedies that were a result of a woman and eventually ended a great legend.</p>
<p>Besides other things, Lancelot was indeed an invincible Round Table knight of that era. If the Rebellious Knight really corresponded to Lancelot, then it was likely to be even stronger than the Holy Spear Knight that John had used.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t doubt the authenticity of the Rebellious Knight Companion Egg. The Cape family was one of the Six League Heroes’ family clans, so for John to dare say such things about betting on the Cape’s family’s honor, there was no need to use a fake Legendary Companion Egg to ruin the reputation of the family.</p>
<p>“Since you are betting with Rebellious Knight, I can give you a chance. However, victory and defeat require a clear definition. You can’t just let me kill you here, can you?” Zhou Wen spoke very seriously.</p>
<p>When people heard this, they felt like Zhou Wen was looking down on John, as though he was saying that John would lose without a doubt and that he would go back on his word when he lost.</p>
<p>John’s eyes twitched a few times, but he suppressed the anger in his heart.</p>
<p>He had paid a heavy price for underestimating Zhou Wen. Now, he needed to fight him again. He believed that it was easy for him to defeat him with his strength. A real battle wasn’t as simple as relying on a powerful Companion Beast. John was confident that he could repress Zhou Wen and his Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, he tried to calm himself down and maintain his usual composure. He took out a pen and drew a circle on his chest.</p>
<p>“It’s your victory as long as you can touch this area,” John said as he pointed at the circle on his chest.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen nodded, but he had no intention of drawing a circle on his chest. It was as though he was saying that he wouldn’t lose.</p>
<p>When John saw Zhou Wen acting in such a manner, he felt even more infuriated. However, it also matched his thoughts. He had no intention of easily defeating Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Not only did he want to defeat Zhou Wen, he also wanted Zhou Wen to pay the price for the matter regarding Liz.</p>
<p>When Wang Fei heard that Zhou Wen had agreed to fight John again, she couldn’t help but frown.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had defeated John by surprise with a powerful Companion Beast. He should have quit while he was ahead, but now, he had been enticed by the Companion Egg and agreed to the battle. It was somewhat irrational.</p>
<p>“Feng Qiuyan, in your opinion, what are the chances of Zhou Wen winning?” Li Xuan asked Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>Although he was most familiar with Zhou Wen, he didn’t know much about John. Furthermore, he was biased, so he couldn’t make an accurate judgment.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan pondered for a moment before saying, “Coach is indeed very strong. If both of them are at the Legendary stage, I think that Coach will definitely win. But if Coach hasn’t advanced to the Legendary stage yet, it’s hard to say. After all, they will be one level apart.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, John walked towards Zhou Wen. At the same time, a golden light condensed on him, transforming into a golden armor that enveloped his entire body.</p>
<p>John clenched his right hand slightly as a gorgeous sword with embedded gems appeared in his hand.</p>
<p>He was tall and handsome. With the gold armor and long sword as a foil for him, he looked mighty and domineering, like a legendary hero knight that saved the world.</p>
<p>With John’s footsteps, his entire body and sword emitted a strange glow. The light seemed to condense into something corporeal that could be seen with the naked eye.</p>
<p>“Is that the famous battle aura Primordial Energy Art of the West district?” Li Xuan and company widened their eyes as they looked at John.</p>
<p>They had only seen battle aura in videos and teaching materials. This was the first time they had seen it with their own eyes.</p>
<p>“Battle aura Primordial Energy Arts are rather common in the West district. It’s somewhat different from our East district’s Primordial Energy Arts. It’s not as converged as our Primordial Energy Art. Typical battle aura arts are more domineering. Once one reaches the Legendary stage, they will have the ability to release their battle aura which has destructive power and is also slightly stronger than most of the East district’s Primordial Energy Arts, Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>At this moment, John, who was less than ten meters away from Zhou Wen, suddenly sped up. He leaped up and slashed at Zhou Wen with both hands wielding his sword.</p>
<p>All the battle aura in him condensed on the sword and transformed into a sword beam that was several meters long. It instantly slashed at Zhou Wen’s head.</p>
<h3 id='chapter148'>Chapter 148 Super Meat Shield</h3>
<p>That strike was too fast and powerful. It was rare to see a sword beam several meters long in the East district.</p>
<p>Although there were quite a number of Primordial Energy Arts and Primordial Energy Skills that allowed the projection of force in the East district, they were usually more converged, so there weren’t any exaggerated effects.</p>
<p>However, to be able to slash out a sword beam that was several meters long meant that John’s strength was indeed extraordinary. Typically, the West district Legendary cultivators who cultivated battle aura and similar Primordial Energy Skills would only produce sword beams that were about a meter long. To have one spanning several meters was truly terrifying.</p>
<p>“This John didn’t reveal his true strength when he was sparring with us. That strike was much stronger than what he previously demonstrated,” Feng Qiuyan said.</p>
<p>“Will Old Zhou, be alright?” Li Xuan was alarmed when he saw the might of the strike.</p>
<p>It wasn’t only Li Xuan. Many of the spectating students were worried for Zhou Wen when they saw such an exaggerated strike, afraid that he would be split into two by the sword.</p>
<p>The two counselors who were in charge of refereeing were already prepared to save Zhou Wen at moment’s notice.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the cleave without any intention of fighting. With a casual wave of his hand, a golden beam of light flashed as a ferocious-looking Golden Warrior appeared in front of him.</p>
<p>The mighty Golden Warrior completely shielded Zhou Wen’s body as it raised its palm to meet John’s terrifying battle aura sword beam.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>An earth-shattering metallic clang sounded. The battle aura golden beam shattered like broken glass in the palm of the three-eyed warrior. The visual impact it dealt on the students made many of them crane their necks to see.</p>
<p>John’s sword cleaved onto the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior’s palm, but it failed to proceed further with the huge palm in the way.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, Three-Eyed Golden Warrior! That guy actually had another Three-Eyed Golden Warrior drop!” Li Xuan felt as if he was going mad.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had a Three-Eyed Golden Warrior drop not too long ago. Back then he gave it to Li Xuan and had said that he could get one to drop for himself if he needed it.</p>
<p>Li Xuan had scoffed at it. The Three-Eyed Golden Warrior was so rare that people didn’t usually encounter one in months. Even if one did, the chances of a Companion Egg dropping was pathetic.</p>
<p>However, how long had it been? Zhou Wen had actually managed to produce another Three-Eyed Diamond? It made Li Xuan suspect that Zhou Wen had reincarnated ten times as a virgin. Otherwise, how could he have such good luck? The heavens had to be compensating him for the miseries in his past lives.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>John unleashed a flurry of slashes with his long sword, but they were all blocked by the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior. Even if it directly hit the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior, it merely left a faint mark.</p>
<p>The Three-Eyed Golden Warrior’s Golden Body and Invulnerable Golden Power made its physical defenses stand at the peak of the Legendary stage. The only weakness was its third eye. Unless the third eye was hit, even Zhou Wen himself would find it difficult to injure it.</p>
<p>“Three-Eyed Golden Warrior, Mutated Demonized General. Zhou Wen is just too enviable. Those are Companion Beasts that can’t even be bought with money!”</p>
<p>“Ignoring everything else, Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts are truly powerful, but he should have advanced to the Legendary stage. Otherwise, how could he incubate such a powerful Legendary Companion Beast?”</p>
<p>“The Heavens are unfair. Just give me one of the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior or Mutated Demonized General.”</p>
<p>“That punk, John, must be feeling depressed. After slashing so many times, he hasn’t even managed to injure the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior. How can he fight Zhou Wen?”</p>
<p>The students discussed fervently, mostly envious of Zhou Wen for having two rare Legendary Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>John originally believed that with his powerful strength, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to kill the Companion Beast in front of him. He wanted to kill Zhou Wen’s beloved Companion Beast just like Zhou Wen had killed Holy Spear Knight. He wanted Zhou Wen to experience what it felt like to lose a Companion Beast before dealing with him.</p>
<p>But very quickly, John’s expression turned extremely ugly. This was because he knew that even if he used all his strength, there was no way he could hurt the Companion Beast in front of him. It was a meat shield-type Companion Beast with powerful defense. It would be meaningless if he continued fighting. It would only be a waste of his Primordial Energy.</p>
<p>It was already too late by the time he realized this. His Primordial Energy at the Legendary stage was limited, and he had already expended most of it.</p>
<p>Wang Fei looked at the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior standing in front of Zhou Wen in a daze. He had managed to have two such Companion Beasts-ones that might not even be purchasable with money, drop in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>With her relationship with Ouyang Lan, she naturally knew that Zhou Wen hadn’t accepted the An family’s help. For him to obtain such a Companion Beast, it was definitely something he had obtained on his own.</p>
<p>This fellow actually managed to kill Mutated Demonized Generals and Three-Eyed Golden Warriors. He’s probably no longer at the Mortal stage, right? Wang Fei looked at Zhou Wen and suddenly felt infuriated.</p>
<p>She had worked so hard to help Zhou Wen grow stronger, but who knew that Zhou Wen had already advanced to the Legendary stage? To think she had been worried for him, afraid that he would lose too terribly.</p>
<p>This punk just needs to be punished. I should intensify the level of his training in the future, Wang Fei thought viciously.</p>
<p>While feeling indignant, Wang Fei felt somewhat excited. Before Zhou Wen entered Sunset College, he was definitely at the Mortal stage. In just a short span of time, he had already advanced to the Legendary stage. Furthermore, he had managed to kill such powerful Legendary creatures in Tiger Cage Pass and the Myriad Buddha Cave.</p>
<p>Such strength was worthy of the word “genius.” If he were to be properly trained in the future, she might really be able to produce a great cultivator.</p>
<p>Sis Lan sure has sharp eyes. Zhou Wen’s talent is indeed not bad and his luck isn’t bad. If he can obtain a special physique in the Holy Land, he might really have the chance to step into the Mythical stage in the future. Wang Fei felt her heart beat faster when she thought of the possibility of producing a Mythical expert. Her cheeks flushed a little red from the rapid circulation of her blood.</p>
<p>John had already stopped attacking. He wanted to retreat and recover his expended Primordial Energy before circling around the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior to attack Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>He knew very well that such super meat shield-type Companion Beasts weren’t fast at all. With his speed and movement techniques, it wasn’t difficult for him to circle around the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior. If he hadn’t wanted to kill Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast, he wouldn’t have been placed in such a passive position.</p>
<p>However, the moment he retreated, Zhou Wen, who had been standing behind the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior, suddenly moved. Like a ghost, he chased up to the retreating John and extended his palm to strike at his chest.</p>
<p>John was alarmed and furious. Zhou Wen had grasped the perfect opportunity when he was retreating. His strength was receding and his center of gravity was shifted backward, making it impossible for him to counterattack.</p>
<h3 id='chapter149'>Chapter 149 The Might of a Flap</h3>
<p>Light patterns on John’s chest emerged and turned into a warrior raising a shield in front of him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen struck the tower shield with his palm, but only managed to make the warrior retreat half a step.</p>
<p>John’s expression was cold as his Primordial Energy churned. His hair flared up and he had a crown-shaped mark of light on his forehead.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was no stranger to this mark. It belonged to one of the six heroes, the Holy Emperor’s hero mark, which also represented the Holy Emperor’s special physique—the Holy Emperor Body.</p>
<p>John’s current condition was a sign that the Holy Emperor Body was being activated. Then, there was no need to guess what John would do next.</p>
<p>“Oh no, John is actually going to use Holy Light Judgment in a spar like this?” An Jing’s expression changed drastically, but it was too late to help.</p>
<p>Others might not know how terrifying Holy Light Judgment was, but An Jing had seen the terror of the Holy Light Judgment in the An family’s database. Although John definitely couldn’t reach the level of the Holy Emperor, a Primordial Energy Skill like Holy Light Judgment was extremely terrifying. It was difficult for opponents of the same level to resist it.</p>
<p>Indeed, John clasped his fingers together as he raised his arms and slashed at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>As he moved, a dazzling glow like the sun burst out from his tightly-locked hands, transforming into a huge blade of light that slashed down.</p>
<p>The blade of light was more than twenty meters long and it was extremely fast. It cleaved down at Zhou Wen like it was a manifestation of lightning, reaching him almost instantaneously.</p>
<p>At that moment, John, who was emitting holy light, looked like a representative of God in the mortal world. He used the power of God to judge the guilty.</p>
<p>Not good… The two counselors who were watching the scene phased away at the same time, hoping to save Zhou Wen before Holy Light Judgment landed.</p>
<p>The spectating students stood up. This attack was too terrifying, one that was far beyond the typical Legendary stage. If Zhou Wen couldn’t withstand it, he would probably be killed by this strike.</p>
<p>A cold look flashed in Zhou Wen’s eyes, but he didn’t have any intention of dodging. Instead, he advanced and extended his hand and beckoned. A small palm-sized fan that resembled jadeite appeared in his hand as he flapped it towards the approaching John who seemed to be delivering God’s punishment.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Under the shocked looks of the crowd, the terrifying blade of light—the manifestation of Holy Light Judgment—was shattered like glass in a hurricane. John’s glowing body was sent flying by the fan and slammed into the tempered glass that lined the borders of the arena and shattered it.</p>
<p>Instantly, the entire venue fell silent. Everyone stared wide-eyed at John, who was struggling to get up from amidst the glass shards.</p>
<p>He was unable to get up even after repeated struggles. His body was still curled up as he shivered, like a creature that was about to freeze to death in an ice cellar.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked in front of John and stepped on his chest. He looked down at him and said coldly, “Do you want to do it again? I can give you another chance.”</p>
<p>John was furious and embarrassed. He had the reputation of being a saint in the West district and was known to be invincible among peers of the same stage. He had never suffered such humiliation in Covenant College. In his anger, anxiety, and embarrassment, together with the injuries caused by the Grand Yin Wind, he spat out a mouthful of blood and passed out.</p>
<p>The two counselors who had rushed in to rescue Zhou Wen were taken aback, momentarily unable to recover from their shock. They had rushed in for a situation completely different from the outcome. It left them at a loss.</p>
<p>“Counselors, I’ll have to trouble you with the rest.” Zhou Wen didn’t care if John was dead or alive as he took out the Round Table knight Companion Egg from John’s backpack and bowed slightly at the two counselors.</p>
<p>“Alright.” One of the counselors finally snapped back to attention and quickly went up to check on John’s injuries.</p>
<p>After all, John was a descendant of the Cape family, and he had inherited the physique of a hero. If he died at Sunset College, it would be a huge problem.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t fazed by this and left after taking the Companion Egg.</p>
<p>“What just happened?”</p>
<p>“Damn, I didn’t see clearly what was going on just now. Why was John, who was like a god descending to the mortal world, sent flying?”</p>
<p>“I saw it. Zhou Wen waved a green fan in his hand at John, sending his sword beam flying together with him.</p>
<p>“That John looks quite scary, but why is he so weak? He can’t even withstand one strike.”</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen sure is terrifying when it comes to strength. Although he relied on the powers of his Companion Beasts, they are still a part of his strength.”</p>
<p>“This Zhou Wen’s background is probably extraordinary. A typical family student wouldn’t have so many powerful Companion Beasts even if they advanced to the Legendary stage.”</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen left, the students snapped to their senses and began discussing excitedly. The main topic was Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts, and the most discussed topic was the Companion Beast which manifested as a green fan.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, you finally made a name for yourself. You sent Saint John flying with a fan. It’s simply exhilarating. What kind of Companion Beast is that fan of yours? It’s really too powerful,” Li Xuan said to Zhou Wen excitedly as they walked to the dorm.</p>
<p>“He’s just too weak.” Zhou Wen didn’t answer Li Xuan’s question. It wasn’t easy to explain the Banana Fairy’s origins, and Zhou Wen didn’t want to tax his brain to fabricate a story, much less deceive his friend.</p>
<p>Li Xuan didn’t ask further either as the two returned to the dorm.</p>
<p>John’s defeat at Sunset College had not only caused a stir at Sunset College, but also caused a great stir in Covenant College.</p>
<p>John, a formerly undefeated hero’s successor, one who had the title of saint, had been beaten up by someone at Sunset College. Furthermore, the person wasn’t the strongest student at Sunset College. The fact that he barely entered the top ten rankings made it clearly unacceptable to them.</p>
<p>For a moment, the discussion forums of Covenant College seemed to explode. Some people claimed that John was not fit to have the title of a saint, nor was he worthy of being the successor of Holy Emperor.</p>
<p>People also said that John should work harder at his cultivation before defeating Zhou Wen and reclaim his glory.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t aware of this, nor was he in the mood to care. He had just hatched the Rebellious Knight and was admiring his attributes.</p>
<p>Rebellious Knight: Legendary</p>
<p>Legendary Life Providence: Fate Knight</p>
<p>Strength: 19</p>
<p>Speed: 19</p>
<p>Constitution: 19</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 19</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Cross Sword, Everlasting Shield, Holy Steed Summoning, Holy Steed Battle Aura</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>It was a Companion Beast with four skills and all its stats reached Overdrive at 19 points. It could be said to be an excellent-grade existence among Legendary Companion Beasts. Its attributes were even more impressive than the Mutated Demonized General.</p>
<h3 id='chapter150'>Chapter 150 Restriction City</h3>
<p>Wang Fei hadn’t been in a good mood recently. Apparently, she hadn’t been in a good mood ever since she had Zhou Wen as a student.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s defeat of John had cheered her up for a period of time, but soon, there was no more joy in her.</p>
<p>She originally believed that Zhou Wen would establish his confidence, stop giving up on himself, and become a hardworking student after defeating John.</p>
<p>However, the truth was completely opposite to what she had imagined. Since Zhou Wen had defeated John, he hadn’t returned to the dimensional zones and just cooped himself in his dorm all day.</p>
<p>According to Wang Fei’s investigations, although she didn’t know what he was doing in the dorm, Zhou Wen’s sunbathing every morning while holding his phone didn’t escape her notice. He was clearly playing a game.</p>
<p>Damn you, Zhou Wen. You’re like a donkey Every time I whip you twice, you’ll take two steps. If I don’t whip you, you just stay there and roll around. Do you really think I can’t do anything about you? The more Wang Fei thought about it, the angrier she became.</p>
<p>She originally believed that Zhou Wen had finally snapped out of his doldrums, but to her surprise, he immediately returned to his original state after the crisis passed. It was like dowsing Wang Fei’s enthusiasm with cold water.</p>
<p>Wang Fei was clearly not someone who could let matters pass. Therefore, she made it her mission to completely free Zhou Wen from the terrible habit of gaming. She wanted him to completely quit his online addiction.</p>
<p>Of course, the reason Wang Fei was so adamant about it was that she didn’t want Zhou Wen’s talent to be wasted.</p>
<p>He thinks he’s impressive just because he defeated John? He’s still far from invincible. Furthermore, he relied on his Companion Beasts, not his own abilities… With this in mind, Wang Fei’s eyes suddenly lit up. She couldn’t help but smile as she revealed a bizarre smile. She had another idea once again.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Zhou Wen didn’t deliberately go to Tiger Cage Pass. He was just too famous. Recently whenever he went out, there were always students he didn’t know coming up to talk to him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t ignore others when they came to greet him out of goodwill, but with so many students doing so, he had no time to focus on gaming.</p>
<p>In addition, his Demonized General and Three-Eyed Golden Warrior had already been revealed, so there was no need for him to pretend to head to the dimensional zones. He might as well stay in his dormitory to play games.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally believed that he could game in peace, but the new homework mission that Wang Fei assigned washed his plans down the drain.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, our counselor is treating us, ordinary students, as special admissions students. The homework mission she assigned us is only given to those special admissions students in past years,” Li Xuan complained after seeing the homework mission.</p>
<p>“What kind of place is Restriction City?” Zhou Wen asked as he looked at the information on the homework mission.</p>
<p>Their new homework mission was to hunt ten bronze beasts in Restriction City, but Zhou Wen had never heard of a dimensional zone known as Restriction City.</p>
<p>Li Xuan said, “Restriction City is one of the underground cities in Luoyang and is one of the few that’s right at the bottom. It isn’t considered dangerous, and there are quite a number of dimensional creatures at the Mortal stage in there. The highest-level ones are only Legendary creatures. However, there’s something very special about Restriction City. There’s no way to use a Companion Beast there. It’s impossible to summon them or use their companion form.”</p>
<p>“In other words, we need to use our strength to kill ten Legendary creatures?” Zhou Wen understood what Li Xuan meant.</p>
<p>“That’s right. This mission has very high standards required of one’s own strength. In the past, only special admissions students received this mission. I never expected that this year, our class would actually be given such a homework mission. I’m afraid most of the students will fail. The students in our class must be wailing in despair now,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Is this bronze beast very difficult to kill?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Although most of the students were still at the Mortal stage, the mission allowed for up to four people to complete the mission. With the collective strength of four students, killing a Legendary creature wasn’t too difficult unless they encountered a creature as powerful as a Mutated Demonized General.</p>
<p>Most of the students had completed the previous mission of killing ordinary Demonized Generals.</p>
<p>“It’s not easy to kill. According to the information, the various attributes of the bronze beasts are pretty good. They do not have any obvious weaknesses. Although they aren’t considered strong among the Legendary stage, they are extremely difficult to deal with. Under the circumstances of not being able to use a Companion Beast, it’s still fine for us at the Legendary stage, but it’s probably very difficult for those Mortal-stage students to accomplish it,” Li Xuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. Let’s head to Restriction City.” Zhou Wen suddenly stood up and pulled Li Xuan out.</p>
<p>“Why are you suddenly so pumped up? Aren’t you gaming?” Li Xuan was puzzled. Zhou Wen had never been so enthusiastic before.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen said, “Since most of our students are unable to complete the homework mission, don’t you think that they will spend money to buy my strategy if I can figure out a strategy?” Zhou Wen said with lit eyes.</p>
<p>“Do you lack money?” Li Xuan was rendered speechless.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Zhou Wen nodded seriously.</p>
<p>“Why do you need money? How much do you need?” Li Xuan asked again.</p>
<p>“I wish to invest in Huang Ji’s game. I’ve previously chatted with him and the first round of investment requires a million bucks for him to first create a simplified version. Development will continue when I have more money,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Are you crazy? What era are we in now? You actually want to invest in developing a game? Are you going to develop it for old people? Young people these days have more and more invested in dimensional zones. Apart from those old people who have never cultivated before, who else would be in the mood to play games?” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Me,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“That’s what depresses me. You game all day, so how are you this strong?” Li Xuan was indeed depressed. On the surface, he appeared to be enjoying himself, but he cultivated hard in private. However, compared to Zhou Wen, his progress was clearly much slower.</p>
<p>“I game to become stronger,” Zhou Wen said seriously.</p>
<p>“F*ck off. Stop pulling my leg. I won’t fall for your trick.” Li Xuan didn’t raise the issue of money again. If Zhou Wen really needed it, he wouldn’t mind helping him. A million wasn’t a huge sum to him.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had indulged in the fantasy of investing in a game. Li Xuan felt that it was best if he wasn’t an accomplice in this, so he didn’t offer the money.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no plans on borrowing money either. He wanted to earn money himself.</p>
<p>Hence, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan went to Restriction City that was deep underground.</p>
<p>Restriction City was in an ancient style. Legend had it that it was the capital city of a certain dynasty in ancient times. It was said to be related to East Zhou, but Zhou Wen didn’t know if it was real or fake.</p>
<p>However, after entering Restriction City, he immediately felt as though the Companion Beasts on him had vanished. He no longer had any connection with them.</p>
<p>However, Banana Fairy and Truth Listener were exceptions. Zhou Wen could still sense their existence and could still use his will to communicate with them.</p>
<p>A Mythical pet is indeed extraordinary. Zhou Wen was somewhat delighted.</p>
<h3 id='chapter151'>Chapter 151 Bronze Luck Beast</h3>
<p>Restriction City was totally unique. There were bronze beasts and bronze birds everywhere in the city, with smaller creatures such as rabbits, rats, sparrows, and bigger creatures such as tigers, wolves, and peacocks everywhere.</p>
<p>Most of the bronze beasts here were at the Mortal stage, and the students’ homework mission was to kill ten Legendary bronze beasts. It looked very simple.</p>
<p>However, without the protection of a Companion Beast, it would be very dangerous for them to charge into a bronze beast horde.</p>
<p>It was fine if ordinary Mortal-level students didn’t have Companion Beasts, but Li Xuan and company were unable to use one even if they had one. It was a very unpleasant feeling.</p>
<p>“There are so many bronze beasts. Which one of them is at the Legendary stage?” Zhou Wen looked at the bronze creatures in the city and was momentarily unable to distinguish them.</p>
<p>“There’s only one Legendary bronze beast in Restriction City called Bronze Lucky Beast. It’s definitely not here. We can only encounter them by walking further in.” Li Xuan paused and pointed at the Mortal-level bronze beasts. “It’s best you ignore those fellows. Let’s charge in and find the Bronze Lucky Beast.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>“There are too many bronze beasts at the Mortal stage. Even if we kill all of them now, another batch will quickly surge in from the spatial rift. There’s no way to clear them no matter how fast we kill. Furthermore, they have very low drop rates. No matter how many we kill, nothing of use will drop. There’s no need to waste time on them,” Li Xuan said as he rushed into the city.</p>
<p>It was rather strange. The bronze beasts and birds in the city were originally motionless like statues, but the moment Li Xuan approached them, the bronze beasts near him came to life and charged at the duo ferociously.</p>
<p>The duo tried their best to avoid their attacks, but once they went past a certain range, the bronze beasts stopped pursuing them. Instead, they automatically returned to their original spots, either crouching or standing, as though they had become statues again.</p>
<p>Only when they reached the crossroads of the city did Li Xuan point at a bronze behemoth’s statue and say, “That’s the Bronze Luck Beast.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a careful look and saw that the statue resembled both a tiger or a lion. It had scales growing on its body, and its tail resembled a snake. On its head was a pair of horns, making it look extremely odd.</p>
<p>“Roar!” The two of them were about fifty meters away from the Bronze Luck Beast when it suddenly came alive. It let out a roar before jumping off the bronze platform and charging at Zhou Wen and Li Xuan like a green beam.</p>
<p>The two quickly dodged, causing the Bronze Luck Beast to miss. Its claws scratched the rock on the ground, leaving deep marks, as though someone had struck it with a sharp ax.</p>
<p>“Is this what you call ordinary?” Zhou Wen knew from its Speed and strength that this fellow was definitely in no way ordinary. It was definitely top-notch at the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>Without using a Companion Beast, Zhou Wen’s Strength and Speed were probably inferior to it.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s punch landed on the Bronze Luck Beast’s body, but his fist turned numb from the impact. He failed to injure it.</p>
<p>“F*ck, how is that possible? The information clearly states that the Bronze Luck Beast’s attributes are ordinary. It’s only about the same as ordinary Golden Warriors, making it a little harder to kill.” Li Xuan was also very depressed.</p>
<p>When the two of them were dealing with the Bronze Luck Beast, the ordinary bronze beasts nearby also pounced forward and caused them some trouble.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Ashen Palm, but it didn’t seem to be of much use against the Bronze Luck Beast. The Bronze Luck Beast’s resistance didn’t seem to be weaker than ordinary Golden Warriors.</p>
<p>However, its Speed was much faster than that of a Golden Warrior. It was among the best, making it extremely difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>After using the Astral Slash Blade, Zhou Wen left a deep mark on the Bronze Luck Beast’s body. However, the damage wasn’t enough to kill it unless Zhou Wen was able to release another two or three more Astral Slash Blade beams.</p>
<p>Having used Astral Slash Blade with all his might, he had drained all of his Primordial Energy. He had none left for a second attack.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and Zhou Wen had no choice but to leave Restriction City and return empty-handed.</p>
<p>“Thankfully, it’s the two of us. If it were those Mortal-stage students, I would be surprised if they hadn’t ended up dying in there. Isn’t the homework mission assigned by Ms. Wang a little ridiculous? Also, why is the information so unreliable?” Li Xuan looked at his tattered clothes and said gloomily.</p>
<p>“Who knows? But that’s good too. I’ll think about it again when I return. If I were to come up with a strategy to kill the Bronze Luck Beasts, there will definitely be many students who will want to buy it.” Zhou Wen was very optimistic because he had already discovered the tiny palm symbol before entering the city and downloaded Restriction City into his phone.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to Zhou Wen, Bronze Luck Beast had a weakness. As long as he spent more time researching it, it was only a matter of time before he found a simple method for killing it. If he wrote a strategy, he might even earn a fortune.</p>
<p>Li Xuan had no choice but to listen to Zhou Wen and return.</p>
<p>After returning to his dorm, Zhou Wen opened the Restriction City’s instance Dungeon and began his repeated grinding.</p>
<p>From the path he took after entering the city, and how to best avoid awakening the bronze beasts to killing the Bronze Luck Beast, Zhou Wen repeatedly experimented.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was right. The Bronze Luck Beasts were much stronger than what was written in the database. Even a Legendary-stage student would find it difficult to kill them without using a Companion Beast in a one-on-one situation.</p>
<p>In the past, special admissions students needed the collection strength of four people to kill the Bronze Luck Beast. Now, most of Zhou Wen’s class was at the Mortal stage, so it was an impossible task to expect them to kill a Bronze Luck Beast.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Zhou Wen had relied on Truth Listener’s and Banana Fairy’s help to successfully kill a Bronze Luck Beast.</p>
<p>After some slow research, he finally managed to kill the Bronze Luck Beast alone. However, his ability to do so didn’t mean that the other students could do it.</p>
<p>Even if he wrote out his strategy, his fellow classmates, whose attributes remained at the Mortal stage or they lacked powerful Primordial Energy Skills, made it impossible for them to use this method and strategy.</p>
<p>Is there really no other way? As Zhou Wen continued killing the Bronze Luck Beasts, he kept studying them, hoping to find a way for his fellow Mortal-stage classmates to kill them.</p>
<p>At that moment, Wang Fei had a smug look on her face. She had indeed issued a homework mission for them to kill the Bronze Luck Beasts, but she had done some tampering with it when handing it out.</p>
<p>Apart from Zhou Wen and Li Xuan, the other students had received the mission to kill a Mortal-stage bronze beast. Only the two of them had received the mission to kill Legendary Bronze Luck Beasts.</p>
<p>They really think they’re impressive. I’ll let those two punks suffer. Wang Fei was very certain that Zhou Wen and Li Xuan wouldn’t be able to complete the mission.</p>
<p>This homework mission was prepared for the Legendary-stage special admissions students this year and had not yet been officially handed out. Even for special admissions students, they needed three to four people to join forces to kill the Bronze Luck Beast.</p>
<p>Now, Li Xuan and Zhou Wen were the only ones in their class who were at the Legendary stage. It was impossible for them to seek help from other students.</p>
<p>When she imagined how Zhou Wen would come to her with his face ashen after failing to complete the mission, Wang Fei was filled with anticipation.</p>
<h3 id='chapter152'>Chapter 152 Chess Mountain</h3>
<p>Cold river water flowed out between the mountains and bright moonlight shone, illuminating the river, giving a sheen that resembled fish scales.</p>
<p>Although the moonlight was bright, it was still terrifyingly dark under the water surface. The mountain pass in the distance was like an abyss, as though it could devour everything at any time.</p>
<p>On the bank of the river, there was a defensive mechanism made of steel concrete. The soldiers held their binoculars and watched the mountain pass.</p>
<p>“It’s already been more than ten days. There’s been nothing happening at Chess Mountain. Is it really as scary as you all say it is?” a soldier muttered.</p>
<p>“That’s because you didn’t see the earlier situation since you were transferred in late. Otherwise, you would have peed your pants.” Another middle-aged soldier chuckled.</p>
<p>“Tsk, what’s there to be afraid of? It’s not like I’ve never entered a dimensional zone before. What haven’t I seen before? Last month, we were ordered to explore a dimensional zone. There, we killed countless dimensional creatures,” the soldier from before said.</p>
<p>The middle-aged soldier curled his lips and said, “I’ve been a soldier for so many years and the dimensional zones I’ve entered and the number of dimensional creatures I’ve seen are more than the number of women you have seen. But that day, I nearly peed my pants. If you really saw what I saw you would have peed your pants on the spot.”</p>
<p>“What did you see that day?” the soldier asked curiously.</p>
<p>“That day, we were under orders to guard the mountain pass. We were planning to enter the mountain the next morning to explore the dimensional zones in the Chess Mountain, but on that night, the river’s waters suddenly turned into something resembling blood…” As the middle-aged soldier spoke, he subconsciously pointed at the river.</p>
<p>However, when his eyes met the surface of the river, his eyes suddenly widened and he stuttered, “Just… like this…”</p>
<p>The young soldier turned his head and under the moonlight, saw that the shimmering lake had turned blood red at some point. The blood-red color rapidly spread out from the mountain pass. In just a moment, the river water had turned into a deep red liquid.</p>
<p>The alarm in the base sounded and all the soldiers and officers that were either on duty or resting got up.</p>
<p>As the highest-ranking officer in the area, Zhao Muye rushed to the outer perimeter of the defenses. When he saw the blood river flowing slowly, his expression turned abnormally grave.</p>
<p>“Commander Zhao, there’s something coming out from the Chess Mountain’s pass,” shouted a soldier who had been using binoculars to monitor the mountain pass.</p>
<p>Zhao Muye looked over with his binoculars. Sure enough, he saw something approaching from the mountain pass. Adjusting the focus of the night vision lens to make out what was it, Zhao Muye’s expression changed drastically.</p>
<p>He saw a humanoid creature walking on the river of blood-towards them. The clothes he wore were very odd. It was likely a product of an ancient era.</p>
<p>That wasn’t the crux. More importantly, the area above his shoulders was empty-he had no head. Instead, the head was in his hands.</p>
<p>That head didn’t look like a human either. It had a green face and sharp fangs. It had crimson hair and a pair of strange horns growing on its head.</p>
<p>The headless monster walked across the bloody river with its head in one hand. It walked out of Chess Mountain and gradually approached the defenses by the river bank.</p>
<p>“Fire!” Zhao Muye ordered calmly as he waited for the headless monster to enter the shooting range.</p>
<p>“Fire… Fire… Fire… Give it whatever you have…” The soldiers who received the order raised their guns and aimed at the headless monster over the river, firing with everything they’d got.</p>
<p>Bullets rained down on the headless monster’s body, instantly tearing his clothes apart. In the blink of an eye, his clothes were riddled with holes.</p>
<p>Seeing the headless monster standing motionless above the river surface, the soldiers couldn’t help but stop shooting, but they quickly realized that something was amiss.</p>
<p>The monster’s clothes were riddled with holes, but no blood flowed out.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the head in the headless monster’s hand opened a bloodshot eye that seemed to contain infinite amounts of blood.</p>
<p>“No good!” Zhao Muye’s expression changed as he summoned his Companion Beast, Guardian Spirit Hawk, turning it into a barrier of light that protected the nearby area.</p>
<p>The headless monster’s body jerked violently. The bullets that had been sent into his body shot back like raindrops. Furthermore, the bullets followed their original trajectories and traced back to their owners.</p>
<p>Bam! Bam! Bam!</p>
<p>The light barrier formed by the Guardian Spirit Hawk failed to block the bullets that were shot back as it was pierced by multiple spots.</p>
<p>Screams were heard as the bullets penetrated the soldiers’ bodies. In a moment, more than half of the soldiers who had fired were killed.</p>
<p>“Change to the newest type of Primordial Gold bullets and continue firing.” Zhao Muye gave the order. However, when he looked at the river surface, he realized that the headless monster had disappeared. Apart from the moonlight that scattered across the river, there was no trace of it.</p>
<p>Zhao Muye cursed under his breath as he summoned his Companion Beast armor and weapon. When he turned around, he realized that the headless monster was holding its head, standing within the defensive line.</p>
<p>The devil- like head and blood-red eyes were staring at Zhao Muye and the soldiers with bloodthirsty eyes.</p>
<p>“Inform the Overseer. Everyone else, prepare for battle!” As Zhao Muye spoke, he raised his saber and slashed at the headless monster. The saber beam was like a rainbow as it streaked across dozens of meters.</p>
<p>To his surprise, the headless monster didn’t dodge at all. Instead, it raised the head in its hand and blocked Zhao Muye’s saber beam.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The saber struck the devil-like face, but it failed to tear apart its skin. The blood-red eyes stared at Zhao Muye under the saber as a creepy smile appeared on his face.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Blood splattered as gunshots rang out. The silent night was completely broken.</p>
<p>“Qihe River Base requesting backup… Qihe River Base requesting backup… A dimensional creature has rushed out of Chess Mountain… It has already rushed into the base… Please provide support immediately…”</p>
<p>When Ah Sheng received the news, his usually stoic expression changed. He immediately awaited An Tianzuo’s further orders.</p>
<p>“Hold on for twenty minutes. Backup will be there soon,” answered An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>“Something happened at Chess Mountain after all. Muye is there…” Ah Sheng said worriedly.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.” An Tianzuo interrupted Ah Sheng with a terse remark.</p>
<p>Several helicopters quickly took off and carried An Tianzuo, Ah Sheng, and a group of spearhead troops towards Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the Qihe River Base, they saw dismembered bodies everywhere. The wounds on the broken limbs looked like they had been bitten off by something.</p>
<p>From afar, the sounds of a clash could still be heard. Ah Sheng rushed over and when he took in the situation before him, his eyes instantly turned red.</p>
<h3 id='chapter153'>Chapter 153 A Simple Strategy Guide</h3>
<p>Blood flowed everywhere, and corpses were strewn all over the place.</p>
<p>There was only one living person left fighting in the entire base. Or rather, it could no longer be considered a living person. His left arm had already been completely severed, and his body was full of bite wounds. A large piece of flesh had been bitten off his left rib. One could vaguely see his internal organs and the bones on his leg were visible beneath their wounds.</p>
<p>Even so, the person was still fighting the headless monster with all his might.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The headless monster bit the person’s thigh with the head in its hand. This bite directly snapped his left thigh bone, causing him to lose his balance. As he retreated, staggering, blood spilled all over the ground.</p>
<p>Ah Sheng’s eyes were red. He pulled out his gun and shot fiercely at the headless monster. At the same time, he rushed over to support Zhao Muye who was about to fall.</p>
<p>“Muye, why aren’t you retreating?” Ah Sheng gritted his teeth as he held onto Zhao Muye’s body.</p>
<p>“Overseer told us to hold on for twenty minutes. It’s not time yet, so how can I leave?” A smile appeared on Zhao Muye’s pale face. “Besides, we can retreat, but the city behind us can’t. Ah Sheng, you don’t have to be sad. This day will come to all humans. I’m just leaving a little early. When you’re tired in the future, we can gather down there and have drinks together…”</p>
<p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>Continuous bullets struck the headless monster, blasting open bloody holes in its body, but the injuries didn’t faze it.</p>
<p>The headless monster held its head and let out a roar as it charged through the pelting shots of eight soldiers, aiming straight for An Tianzuo who was standing behind them.</p>
<p>Clearly, the headless monster’s intelligence wasn’t low. It was able to tell that An Tianzuo was leading these people and wanted to kill him first.</p>
<p>The headless monster’s skin suffused a demonic red glow as the bullets made of Primordial Gold failed to injure it. It charged through the storm of bullets, using the head in its hand to bite An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo remained unperturbed as he pulled out a gun and fired two shots at the headless monster.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>The first bullet hit the head’s cheekbones, causing the head to tilt a little before the second bullet drilled right through its ear.</p>
<p>Blood splattered out from the ear before it began bleeding from all seven orifices. Its eyes exploded and the headless body collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo didn’t look at the corpse as he walked towards Ah Sheng, who was hugging Zhao Muye.</p>
<p>“Overseer, Muye is dead.” Ah Sheng raised his head, his eyes filled with grief. In his arms, Zhao Muye had already breathed his last.</p>
<p>“I gained control of the An family when I was 13 years old. At that time, Muye was already an assistant regional commander figure. So many years have passed and he still remains one. It’s not that he didn’t have the chance to be promoted, nor was he incapable. Instead, it was because he wanted to stand at the front line of Chess Mountain to protect those people that he now can’t ever help again.” An Tianzuo sighed. “Let him go. He deserves the rest.”</p>
<p>“Overseer, when I first joined the army, Muye was the one who took care of me and taught me. I want to take him back to bury him with his family,” Ah Sheng said.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t have family,” said An Tianzuo. “His family died in Chess Mountain, but their corpses were never found.”</p>
<p>Ah Sheng instantly fell silent. He couldn’t say a word, his heart was filled with unbearable pain.</p>
<p>“Bury him outside Chess Mountain. Let him watch over the area. One day, we will charge into Chess Mountain and slay all those dimensional creatures on his behalf. Perhaps he will truly rest in peace when that happens,” said An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>“The situation at Chess Mountain is getting worse. Even our latest primordial Gold bullets have started to lose their effectiveness. I’m afraid the situation is worsening,” Ah Sheng said.</p>
<p>“That’s why we need to find the source of the dimensional zones and resolve the problem at the root. Otherwise, no number of dimensional creatures killed will matter,” An Tianzuo said as he looked in the direction of Chess Mountain. “Now, many dimensional zones have already appeared in various parts of the League. If we can’t find a way to resolve it as soon as possible, the ones dying won’t just be Muye and these soldiers. All of mankind will suffer annihilation. We have no time to spare. Let’s go. We have no time for grief. There are plenty of things that need our attention.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been researching a simplified strategy for the killing of Bronze Luck Beasts. He didn’t know that other than him and Li Xuan, no one else in his class needed the strategy</p>
<p>After a few days, Zhou Wen finally figured out a way to kill Bronze Luck Beasts at the Mortal stage. After getting Li Xuan to come over, he planned on test-driving the strategy with just the two of them.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, can this strategy of yours really work?” Li Xuan read Zhou Wen’s strategy and found it unbelievable that Bronze Luck Beasts could be killed that easily.</p>
<p>“Don’t underestimate it. This is the result of me spending days racking my brains. As long as you follow the steps according to the guide, you will definitely be able to easily kill a Bronze Luck Beast,” Zhou Wen said as he tapped Li Xuan, while holding a camera.</p>
<p>“Are you sure we don’t need two people? Can I really do it myself?” Li Xuan was still doubtful.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Zhou Wen said with certainty.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you give it a try with me first? It’s inevitable that I’ll make mistakes the first time. We can watch each other’s backs if we do it together. It’ll be more convenient to remedy the situation.” Li Xuan felt that Zhou Wen had only been to Restriction City with him once. If the strategy he wrote was problematic, wouldn’t he be in deep trouble? He wanted Zhou Wen involved no matter what.</p>
<p>“Ain’t I in charge of filming you? If anything goes wrong, I’ll naturally take action,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Li Xuan thought that made sense. Since Zhou Wen was going in with him, He wouldn’t just sit idly if something bad happened. He wasn’t going to continue filming his death, right?</p>
<p>The two entered Restriction City one after the other. Li Xuan charged ahead according to the strategy Zhou Wen had written while Zhou Wen followed behind him, filming. They soon entered deep into Restriction City.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was originally worried that Zhou Wen’s strategy would be problematic, but when he charged in, he realized that it was as though he had entered a no man’s land. The bronze beasts didn’t even touch him at all.</p>
<p>Finally, while battling the Bronze Luck Beast, he used perfect positioning and the Bronze Luck Beast’s weakness to easily kill it. It was so easy that Li Xuan suspected that the Bronze Luck Beast wasn’t the same one they had encountered before.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, nice strategy! How did you come up with it?” Li Xuan tried again and realized that killing the Bronze Luck Beast was extremely simple. Even ordinary Mortal-stage students would find it easy to kill the Bronze Luck Beast if they knew its weakness and joined forces.</p>
<p>“Do you think I can sell this strategy for money?” Zhou Wen was more concerned about money.</p>
<p>“Definitely. Such an awesome strategy guide definitely will have people willing to spend money to buy it. With our classmates still at the Mortal stage, they definitely won’t be able to complete their homework mission without this strategy,” Li Xuan said with certainty.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s head back and seek out buyers now.” Zhou Wen was eager to know how much his strategy guide could be sold for.</p>
<h3 id='chapter154'>Chapter 154 A Strategy Guide That Can’t Be Sold</h3>
<p>“What did you say?” Li Xuan’s eyes widened as he glared at a female student and shouted loudly.</p>
<p>The girl looked a little afraid and said meekly, “My mission is done… There’s no need… There’s no need to buy your strategy…”</p>
<p>“That’s impossible. Are you joking with me? How did you kill the Bronze Luck Beasts?” Li Xuan said while glaring at the girl in disbelief.</p>
<p>The girl said cautiously, “I didn’t kill Bronze Luck Beasts; I only killed ten Bronze Bunnies and completed the mission.”</p>
<p>“Bronze Bunnies? Isn’t our mission to kill Legendary bronze beasts? What’s the point of killing Bronze Bunnies?” Li Xuan said with a frown.</p>
<p>“The homework mission didn’t say to kill Legendary bronze beasts. All you need to do is kill bronze beasts.” The girl hurriedly took out her phone to show Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Indeed, her homework mission only stated that she needed to kill bronze beasts. There was no rule that required her to kill those at the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>“That’s impossible, right? We can’t be mistaken?” Li Xuan hurriedly took out his cell phone and read his homework mission again, confirming that he wasn’t wrong. It clearly indicated that he needed to kill Legendary-stage bronze beasts.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, what does yours say?” Li Xuan asked Zhou Wen again.</p>
<p>“Same as yours.” Zhou Wen handed his phone to Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Li Xuan took a glance and, just like him, quickly made a few phone calls. Soon, he looked at Zhou Wen with an odd expression and said, “All of our classmates received missions to kill bronze beasts. We are the only two who received the mission to kill Legendary-stage bronze beasts.”</p>
<p>“Could it be a mistake?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“It’s impossible for the wrong message to be sent. They are sent en masse. If it was sent wrongly, all the students must have received the wrong message. How can it be just the two of us? This is clearly a message that was separately sent to us,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Then doesn’t that mean that my strategy won’t be of any use?” Zhou Wen’s first thought wasn’t why Wang Fei had given them such a difficult mission, but if his strategy guide could still be sold.</p>
<p>“That’s hard to say. According to what I know, the class of special admissions students received this mission as well. However, those guys are basically at the Legendary stage and all of them have their noses up in the air. They probably won’t spend money on buying your strategy,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown when he heard that he might not be able to sell the strategy guide. However, when he thought of Wang Lu, his eyes lit up again. He turned to Li Xuan and asked, “Li Xuan, is there any record in Restriction City? I mean the time record for killing the Bronze Luck Beast.”</p>
<p>“Definitely. There are records in every dimensional zone.” Li Xuan instantly understood what Zhou Wen was getting at. “You mean you wish to sell this strategy to special admissions students who wish to break the record?”</p>
<p>“I can give it a try.” Zhou Wen felt that there was a chance. He planned on asking Wang Lu to see if she was interested in buying the strategy.</p>
<p>They returned to Four Seasons Garden and went to Wang Lu’s dorm to look for her. They happened to meet her on the way there. She was accompanied by about five special admissions students, seemingly having just returned. They were chatting as they walked, as though they were discussing something.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, what a coincidence!” Wang Lu greeted Zhou Wen and Li Xuan when she saw them.</p>
<p>“It’s not a coincidence. We came here especially to find you. Did you special admissions students receive the homework mission to kill the Bronze Luck Beasts?” Zhou Wen asked directly.</p>
<p>“That’s right. What’s the matter?” Wang Lu looked at Zhou Wen curiously, unsure why he would suddenly ask.</p>
<p>“It’s this. Li Xuan and I have figured out a strategy to kill the Bronze Luck Beast. It should be of some help for killing them, allowing you to kill them faster and even break the record. Would you be interested?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Before Wang Lu could say a word, a male student beside her said, “Zhou Wen, we admit that your Companion Beasts are indeed powerful. Unfortunately, we don’t have any as powerful as yours. Your strategy is useless to us.”</p>
<p>“The strategy we came up with doesn’t need any special Companion Beasts. Besides, they can’t be used in Restriction City,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Since no one can use a Companion Beast, we can figure out a method to kill the Bronze Luck Beasts ourselves. Why would we need to spend money on your strategy?” said the boy with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen finally realized that with his low EQ, he had overlooked a problem. Those who could enter Sunset College were geniuses, and the special admissions students were geniuses among geniuses. They were all rather proud, so to get them to spend money to buy a strategy from someone else would be akin to making them admit that they were inferior to others. How could proud special admissions students be willing to spend money to buy such a thing?</p>
<p>Another female student also said, “Zhou Wen, we came to Sunset College to hone ourselves. We have to experience it for ourselves before we can improve. Buying someone else’s strategy is equivalent to cheating. It’s meaningless to us.”</p>
<p>The other special admissions students likely had similar views.</p>
<p>Wang Lu said, “Zhou Wen, I’m sure your strategy is useful, but I still want to challenge myself.”</p>
<p>With Wang Lu saying that, Zhou Wen knew that there was no hope in selling his strategy.</p>
<p>After they returned to the dorm, Li Xuan said to Zhou Wen, “From the looks of it, the strategy would be a tough sell. I wonder what Ms. Wang was thinking. Why didn’t she tell us earlier that only the two of us were given the mission to kill Bronze Luck Beasts? We wasted so much time researching a strategy.”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. Just treat it as a form of training and learning.” Zhou Wen didn’t mind.</p>
<p>Li Xuan thought for a moment and said, “By the way, you can post the strategy guide to our school’s intranet forums. It allows for monetization. Who knows, those special admissions students might be embarrassed to buy it in front of others, but wouldn’t have scruples doing it in private.”</p>
<p>“Alright, help me post it. However, the price must be set high. Such a strategy guide isn’t worth anything if it’s spread, so it’s best to earn as much as possible in one go.” Zhou Wen still remembered the painful experience of posting the last strategy and warned Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“But if the price is too high, it won’t be easy for them to be purchased, right?” Li Xuan remarked hesitantly.</p>
<p>“It’s fine even if it can’t be sold, as long as it’s not sold too cheaply.” Zhou Wen was quite open-minded.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Li Xuan nodded and posted the strategy on the school’s intranet forum. When he was done, he saw Zhou Wen lying on the sofa gaming again. He asked, “Aren’t you bored to death gaming all day? All you do is kill those ants. Isn’t it boring?”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” Zhou Wen said without looking up.</p>
<p>“Stop gaming. Join me as I kill the ten Bronze Luck Beasts first. We’ll break the record. Since those special admissions students don’t want to, let’s break it ourselves,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed Li Xuan to Restriction City. As for the post, it attracted the attention of someone.</p>
<p>The counselor of the special admissions class, Liu Zhengyan, saw the post titled “A god’s guide to slaying a Bronze Luck Beast in a minute.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter155'>Chapter 155 Liu Zhengyan’s Plan</h3>
<p>It isn’t difficult to kill a Bronze Luck Beast in a minute at the Epic stage. For those at the Legendary stage to kill Bronze Luck Beasts in such a short period of time without using a Companion Beast is not impossible, but it’s just too difficult. Liu Zhengyan was originally curious, but after trying to take a look at the content, he realized that it was monetized. Furthermore, the points needed to read it when converted to League current was ridiculous. It cost more than twenty thousand.</p>
<p>Students nowadays really have all sorts of tricks up their sleeves. They want to cheat money like that? Liu Zhengyan shook his head slightly and logged into the management account on the forum.</p>
<p>Liu Zhengyan was one of the moderators of the forum. If this was really a scam, he would have to deal with it and not let the other students be fooled.</p>
<p>Although he felt that Sunset College didn’t have a student with such low intelligence, he still needed to quickly deal with any necessary threads.</p>
<p>After logging into the moderator’s account, Liu Zhengyan used his authority to check Li Xuan’s post without spending any money. Although he felt that it was definitely a scam, he still planned on confirming it first.</p>
<p>Very quickly, Liu Zhengyan saw the contents of the post and his expression changed drastically. He started off calm and indifferent, but in the end, he was flabbergasted. The changes to his face seemed like an artistic act.</p>
<p>Is this strategy really feasible? Based on Liu Zhengyan’s understanding of Restriction City and Bronze Luck Beasts, the strategy did seem feasible. More importantly, there were a few places that even he didn’t know if they were real or fake. He was unable to determine the authenticity of the strategy.</p>
<p>If it’s really possible, then the person who wrote this strategy is amazing. Liu Zhengyan decided to make a trip to Restriction City and personally test it out.</p>
<p>If this strategy were real, he planned on including it as teaching material and let all the special admissions students study it.</p>
<p>Liu Zhengyan didn’t want them to learn how to kill Bronze Luck Beasts, but to learn from the line of thinking and methods used to derive the strategy.</p>
<p>The rarest thing about this strategy was that it was a meticulous and creative design. There was no need to rely on powerful strength to resolve the problem. It was solely designed using perfect positioning, suppression, and the use of the opponent’s weakness. If the strategy was proven to be real, even a few Mortal-stage cultivators could kill the Bronze Luck Beast in a group. Such a strategy was simply the work of a genius.</p>
<p>Liu Zhengyan eagerly headed to Restriction City. He only wanted to quickly verify the authenticity of the strategy.</p>
<p>However, when he entered Restriction City, he realized that someone was already killing Bronze Luck Beasts. The few of them near the city gates had already been killed.</p>
<p>Liu Zhengyan’s heart stirred as he headed deep into the city. Indeed, not long after, he saw two students killing the Bronze Luck Beasts.</p>
<p>When he saw the movements of the two students, he immediately came to a realization. He didn’t need to experiment anymore and he knew that the strategy was real. Besides, he already knew who had posted it.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and Zhou Wen, were they the ones who wrote that strategy? Liu Zhengyan looked from afar at the duo’s slaying of the Bronze Luck Beasts and only grew increasingly alarmed.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was executing the steps of the designed strategy. With his strength alone, he could easily kill the Bronze Luck Beast. The entire process definitely took less than a minute. This had already broken the student records of the school.</p>
<p>The crux of the matter was that Li Xuan had completed it too easily. Furthermore, it also proved that Bronze Luck Beasts had a huge weakness. As long as one targeted this weakness, killing it would be too easy.</p>
<p>What left Liu Zhengyan even more surprised was Zhou Wen. Although the person attacking the Bronze Luck Beast was Li Xuan, Zhou Wen had been following him all the way with a camera. He tossed and turned in the group of bronze beasts and followed Li Xuan, perfectly capturing his every move.</p>
<p>It was not easy to keep up with Li Xuan’s actions, much less in Restriction City. There were many Mortal-stage bronze beasts and bronze birds around.Read more chapter on our vipnovel.com</p>
<p>With the bronze beasts awoken by Li Xuan, Zhou Wen’s subsequent tailing of him made the bronze beasts and bronze birds target him with priority. However, Zhou Wen’s pace was light and nimble as though he was taking a stroll. He didn’t even look at the bronze beasts, yet he was able to dodge all of their attacks.</p>
<p>The entire process was pleasing to the eyes, so fluid that Liu Zhengyan felt like it was a sight to behold.</p>
<p>This Zhou Wen doesn’t only have powerful Companion Beasts. His standards aren’t bad either. He should be more than able to enter the special admission class. The more Liu Zhengyan looked at him, the more he felt that difficulty as a videographer was more difficult than Li Xuan who was the protagonist when hunting the Bronze Luck Beasts.</p>
<p>When Liu Zhengyan had watched the entire process of the two of them hunting the Bronze Luck Beast, he secretly left Restriction City without alarming Zhou Wen and Li Xuan.</p>
<p>After returning to his office, he logged on to the website again and found the thread Li Xuan had posted. Then, he clicked on it.</p>
<p>This time, Liu Zhengyan didn’t use his moderator account and access. Instead, he purchased the monetized thread as a normal user.</p>
<p>Since I’ve already paid for it, it shouldn’t be a problem for me to use it. Liu Zhengyan smiled and had already made up his mind.</p>
<p>The special admissions class was different from the ordinary classes. If the ordinary students of Sunset College were left to develop themselves, then the students of the special class were specially nurtured.</p>
<p>There was no saying which of the two teaching methods was exactly good or bad, but the teaching methods of the special class were more targeted with results showing faster.</p>
<p>However, this kind of teaching method required the students to have a very good foundation. This was something that ordinary students did not have. At the same time, they also needed a large number of resources from the college, so it was difficult to extend it to everyone.</p>
<p>Liu Zhengyan planned to use this strategy as teaching material and give detailed explanations to the students of the special class.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t for now, but after the special admissions students completed their homework missions.</p>
<p>With the pride and confidence of the special admissions students, they would definitely be very confident in their own results. Some would even feel proud of their own results.</p>
<p>However, if they saw this strategy and saw the tremendous effects of it, he believed that it would be a good learning experience for them.</p>
<p>However, before that, Liu Zhengyan had to confirm that those students didn’t know about it already; otherwise, the educational effects would be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Liu Zhengyan wasn’t worried about the thread on the discussion forum. With such a high price, no student would be foolish enough to purchase it.</p>
<p>The only thing that needed to be resolved was Li Xuan and Zhou Wen’s recorded results.</p>
<p>It looks like I need to have a good chat with Ms. Wang. Liu Zhengyan decided to discuss the matter with Wang Fei, and get her to temporarily hold back Li Xuan and Zhou Wen’s results and videos. It wouldn’t be too late to announce them after he had finished teaching his students.</p>
<h3 id='chapter156'>Chapter 156 Who Was the One Who Wrote The Strategy Guide?</h3>
<p>Wang Fei had been in a rather good mood recently. Ever since she gave Zhou Wen the mission to kill the Bronze Luck Beasts, her mood had greatly improved.</p>
<p>“Ms. Wang, are you there?” Liu Zhengyan’s voice and knocking came from outside her office.</p>
<p>Wang Fei opened the door and invited Liu Zhengyan in. She poured him a cup of tea and asked with a smile, “Mr. Liu, what’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“It’s like this, Teacher Wang. Did you assign a homework mission for Zhou Wen and Li Xuan to kill Bronze Luck Beasts?” Liu Zhengyan asked frankly.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I inform you about this matter? Did something happen?” Wang Fei looked at Liu Zhengyan in confusion.</p>
<p>“Nothing happened. I just have something to ask of you,” Liu Zhengyan said.</p>
<p>“Mr. Liu, you are my senior. You helped me a lot when I first joined the school. There’s no need to be so polite with me if there’s anything you need me to do,” Wang Fei said.</p>
<p>Liu Zhengyan said, “Alright, then I won’t stand on ceremony with you. I hope you can temporarily hold back Zhou Wen and Li Xuan’s results and videos. You can report their results and videos after my class completes the homework mission.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Liu, I don’t understand. What are you getting at?” Wang Fei was confused as she did not know what Liu Zhengyan meant.</p>
<p>It wasn’t difficult for her to do so, nor did it violate any of her principles. However, Wang Fei simply didn’t understand the meaning behind his actions.</p>
<p>Liu Zhengyan pointed at the computer in front of Wang Fei. “Ms. Wang, open the student discussion forums on the intranet and take a look at the post titled ‘A god’s guide to slaying a Bronze Luck Beast in a minute.””</p>
<p>Wang Fei doubtfully clicked open the forum and found the thread that Liu Zhengyan was talking about. When she saw that it was actually a monetized thread with a ridiculously high price, she couldn’t help but look at Liu Zhengyan.</p>
<p>“Buy it and take a look. You won’t regret reading the contents in it,” Liu Zhengyan said with a smile.</p>
<p>Wang Fei hesitated for a moment before following Liu Zhengyan’s instructions. She bought the thread and clicked on it to read its contents.</p>
<p>When she read it, Wang Fei’s expression was similar to the one Liu Zhengyan had when he first read it. Slowly, it turned to shock as she turned to look at Liu Zhengyan and asked, “Is what’s written real?”</p>
<p>“Every word of it. I’ve already verified it,” Liu Zhengyan said.</p>
<p>“Was this strategy guide written by you, Mr. Liu. It’s really impressive.” Wang Fei misunderstood and thought that the strategy guide was written by Liu Zhengyan.</p>
<p>He shook his head and said, “I didn’t write the thread. I thought that it was a scam. I wanted to delete it, but after reading the content, I realized that it was a real strategy. Furthermore, it’s a shocking one.”</p>
<p>“If it wasn’t written by you, then which teacher would write a strategy for Bronze Luck Beasts?” Wang Fei subconsciously believed that most Legendary students wouldn’t be able to write such a strategy. It was likely written by a certain teacher.</p>
<p>“The strategy guide isn’t written by any teacher.” Liu Zhengyan shook his head again.</p>
<p>“If it’s not written by a teacher, then who…” As Wang Fei spoke, she seemed to have some nasty thoughts surface in her mind.</p>
<p>Liu Zhengyan said, “This is the reason why I wanted you to hold back Zhou Wen and Li Xuan’s results. This strategy guide should be written by both of them or either one of them. I’ve seen them use this method to kill a Bronze Luck Beast with my own eyes. It’s absolutely feasible and there aren’t any problems. Therefore, I wish to use this strategy as teaching material for my students. However, I hope that they won’t know of the duo’s results ahead of time. Nor do I wish for them to see their videos. It’s why I’m here to trouble you.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Liu, are you sure that this thread was written by Zhou Wen and Li Xuan?” Wang Fei stared at Liu Zhengyan with widened eyes. She really couldn’t accept this outcome.</p>
<p>She originally believed that she had Zhou Wen under her thumb, but she suddenly realized that the obstacle she had set up for Zhou Wen was completely useless. To think that she had been gloating over it.</p>
<p>“No doubt about it. They wrote it. As long as you see their videos, you will understand that apart from the original author, no one else can do as well as they do, especially Zhou Wen, who’s the videographer. If you have the chance, you should go to Restriction City to take a look. The videographer’s performance will be more interesting than the main character in the video,” Liu Zhengyan said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Mr. Liu, I’ll follow your request. Don’t worry, I’m very sorry, but I’ll be heading out for a while now.” Wang Fei decided to listen to Liu Zhengyan’s advice and go to Restriction City to take a look.</p>
<p>She couldn’t believe that a gamer like Zhou Wen who gamed all day could write such a strategy.</p>
<p>When Wang Fei rushed to Restriction City, Li Xuan was slaying the tenth Bronze Luck Beast for his mission. This was because he had spent too much time searching for Bronze Luck Beasts in Restriction City; otherwise, the mission would have been completed ages ago.</p>
<p>Although Wang Fei didn’t see the complete process, with only the second half of Li Xuan’s hunt, it was enough to shock her.</p>
<p>It was not only because the strategy was just as Liu Zhengyan had said, but also because of Zhou Wen’s movement techniques during the filming. That level of difficulty was even higher than Li Xuan’s hunting of the Bronze Luck Beast.</p>
<p>If not for the fact that he knew the bronze beasts in Restriction City like the back of his hand, it would be impossible for him to reach such a level. Zhou Wen’s movement technique was as though he had installed a Heavenly Eye. He took into consideration the reactions of all the nearby bronze beasts and without even looking at them, he perfectly dodged all their attacks while following Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Now, she finally understood why Liu Zhengyan was so certain that the strategy guide was written by the duo. Only someone who knew the bronze beasts so well could write such a strategy.</p>
<p>This fellow… He’s just too talented… How did he do it? Wang Fei looked at Zhou Wen with an odd expression as she felt mixed emotions. It was hard to describe what she felt.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was more outstanding than she imagined. As Zhou Wen’s counselor, Wang Fei was very pleased and happy for her good friend, Ouyang Lan.</p>
<p>However, when she thought of how such a genius was obsessed with mobile games, the words “what a waste of a treasure” surfaced in her mind.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan didn’t notice the distant Wang Fei. After Li Xuan completed his mission, it was Zhou Wen’s turn to kill ten Bronze Luck Beasts.</p>
<p>This change made Wang Fei more certain that the strategy was written by Zhou Wen, at least he took most of the credit.</p>
<p>When Li Xuan did the filming, his movements were clearly a lot more amateurish. From time to time, he had to take care of the attacks of the Mortal-stage bronze beasts to prevent himself from being injured. He wasn’t able to be as focused as Zhou Wen on the filming.</p>
<h3 id='chapter157'>Chapter 157 Multiple Life Providences</h3>
<p>When Wang Fei returned, she was exceptionally calm.</p>
<p>She was somewhat astonished by Zhou Wen’s talent and capabilities. She believed that his gifts could no longer be judged simply by the standards of a genius.</p>
<p>Throughout her teaching career, she had never seen a student like him.</p>
<p>What Zhou Wen needs is no longer repetitive suppressive training. Such a student needs to be given more new things that he can analyze for himself. Wang Fei decided to return and think about it. She had never taught a student like him, so she needed to think more and reflect on herself. She wanted to come up with a new way to educate a student like Zhou Wen instead of using her past experiences on him.</p>
<p>After handing in the Bronze Luck Beast homework mission, Wang Fei didn’t give him any more strange homework missions. Zhou Wen finally had some peace and quiet and now had the time to properly game.</p>
<p>Outside Tiger Cage Pass, he encountered another Paper Demonized General.</p>
<p>Drop me a Companion Egg! Zhou Wen commanded his Demonized General Companion Beast to charge forward as he waited in anticipation.</p>
<p>The reason for his anticipation was that if his Demonized General could fuse with a Paper Demonized General once again, wouldn’t it become a complete Companion Beast with three skills?</p>
<p>The Demonized General’s Astral Slash Blade restrained the Paper Demonized General, easily slaying it. At the instant the Paper Demonized General’s head was chopped off, a resplendent crystal dropped.</p>
<p>An 18-valued Speed Crystal. That’s not too bad. Zhou Wen was somewhat helpless. Although he could encounter Paper Demonized Generals more frequently than the average person, there was no way to guarantee his drop rate. All he could do was rely on luck.</p>
<p>The absorption of the Speed Crystal allowed all four of his attributes to reach 18. He was considered to be at the peak of the ordinary Legendary stage, but he was still 3 points behind Truth Listener’s and Banana Fairy’s 21 points.</p>
<p>Although it was only three points, the higher the stat needed, the harder it was to raise. Normal Legendary creatures only produced 18-valued stats crystals at best. Even mutated Legendary creatures dropped 19-valued stats crystals. It was difficult to obtain 20-valued stats crystals, not to mention 21-valued stats crystals.</p>
<p>I wonder if I can increase my attribute points by cultivating other Primordial Energy Arts like in the Mortal stage? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and decided to visit Small Buddha Temple. After he advanced to the Legendary stage, he wanted to see if the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra’s stone monument was of any use.</p>
<p>It had been a long time since he had been to Small Buddha Temple, but the environment here remained unchanged. When Zhou Wen came in front of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Pillar, his gaze landed on the stone monument. When he looked at it, the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra in his body automatically began to circulate, evolving into the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>Soon, the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra had risen to the Legendary realm. He didn’t face any obstacles during the advancement. It was so simple that it made Zhou Wen suspect that he wasn’t cultivating a Primordial Energy Art, but just doing a copy and paste.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the blood-colored avatar’s stats and couldn’t help but be taken aback.</p>
<p>He didn’t sense any special changes in his body, but the blood-colored avatar’s attributes changed drastically.</p>
<p>There were a total of two changes. Zhou Wen’s original Legendary Life Providence was Sigh of the King, but it was now gone. Replacing it was a Life Providence named “Eight Perfections Wisdom.”</p>
<p>Together with the change in Life Providence, Zhou Wen’s Primordial Energy Art also changed. It went from only having Lost Immortal Sutra to being replaced with Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra.</p>
<p>Instead, the stats that Zhou Wen hoped to increase didn’t increase. The four stats remained at 18 points.</p>
<p>It can’t be? Could it be that the Lost Immortal Sutra has changed into the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly attempted to switch back to the Lost Immortal Sutra’s mode.</p>
<p>The outcome made Zhou Wen heave a sigh of relief. His Life Providence changed back to the Sigh of the King, and his Primordial Energy Art changed back to the Lost Immortal Sutra.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen switched back and forth a few times and realized that as long as he switched to the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, his Life Providence would also change.</p>
<p>Although his Life Providence had changed, Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that it didn’t change at all. It was as though he still had his original Life Providence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the two Life Providences gave him a completely different feeling. The Sigh of the King gave Zhou Wen a feeling that it was one with his body, but although the Eight Perfections Wisdom had an extremely intimate tie with his body, he felt that it was lacking something compared with the Sigh of the King.</p>
<p>However, he could clearly sense the characteristics of Eight Perfections Wisdom. It was similar to the typical feeling people had after possessing a Life Providence. It was unlike the Sigh of the King. Even Zhou Wen himself was half aware of it.</p>
<p>I wonder if there will be another Life Providence after I upgrade the Ancient Imperial Sutra at the Fire God Platform? Zhou Wen immediately confirmed his guess and left the Small Buddha Temple’s instance dungeon before switching to the Ancient Imperial City.</p>
<p>After returning to the Fire God Platform, he read the Ancient Imperial Sutra on the monument. It was similar to his previous experience. The Ancient Imperial Sutra automatically advanced to the Legendary stage, causing Zhou Wen’s Life Providence and Primordial Energy Art to experience changes.</p>
<p>Ancient Emperor. When Zhou Wen looked at the two words of his Life Providence, he understood the benefits that such a Life Providence could bring him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen made another trip to Mount Laojun’s instance dungeon, and the outcome was the same. The Wordless Monument also gave him a Life Providence of Dao Body, and the Primordial Energy Art only had two words, “Dao Sutra.”</p>
<p>However, be it the Eight Perfections Wisdom, Ancient Emperor, or Dao Body, despite being able to clearly sense their effects, Zhou Wen found it unnatural. He felt as though the Life Providences didn’t belong to him.</p>
<p>Only the Sigh of the King made Zhou Wen feel like there was no distance in between it and him.</p>
<p>Could it be that those Life Providences and Primordial Energy Arts aren’t actually possessed by me, but a product of the Lost Immortal Sutra’s effects? Zhou Wen long had his suspicions, but it only felt more real this time.</p>
<p>Taking out the oil lamp, Zhou Wen rubbed it once again. The oil lamp, which no longer had any characters, light, or darkness appearing on it, suddenly produced a projection of text. It turned Zhou Wen’s Life Providence into Godfiend and his Primordial Energy Art turned into Godfiend Era.</p>
<p>Just like the first three Life Providences, the Godfiend’s Life Providence also felt somewhat distant. It made him uneasy, but it was only a feeling. It didn’t obstruct him from using it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t able to use four different Life Providences at the same time. He could use the corresponding Life Providence when his Primordial Energy Art switched to the corresponding type, and different Life Providences gave him different augmentations.</p>
<p>Eight Perfections Wisdom greatly augmented his body. It was similar to Li Xuan’s Immortal God of Combat that allowed for his physical resilience to improve greatly as he gained a powerful recovery ability.</p>
<p>The Dao Body Life Providence augmented his Primordial Energy, greatly increasing Zhou Wen’s recovery speed. It just took him a few seconds to regain all his Primordial Energy.</p>
<p>The Ancient Emperor Life Providence raised all his stats, but it mainly increased his Strength greatly. Furthermore, it made his Strength attribute experience some abnormal changes.</p>
<p>The Godfiend Life Providence was the oddest. Zhou Wen originally believed that it would augment his Speed attribute greatly, but that wasn’t the case. The Godfiend Life Providence augmented all his attributes, but not by much. Its main purpose was to allow Zhou Wen to possess the ability to fly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter158'>Chapter 158 Raising a Weighted Feather .</h3>
<p>With the Godfiend’s Life Providence, Zhou Wen could choose not to use any Primordial Energy Skills, nor did he need to borrow the wings of his Companion Beast to directly float in the air. Furthermore, he could fly freely, as though he had invisible stairs in the air.</p>
<p>Every Life Providence had its unique effects, and they all seemed very powerful, but Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that these powers didn’t belong to him.</p>
<p>He was at home studying the effects of the Primordial Energy Arts and Life Providences when he suddenly heard the doorbell ring.</p>
<p>At first, he thought it was Li Xuan, but when he opened the door, he realized that it was Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>“Why are you here?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Coach, I would like you to tailor a second cultivation plan for me,” Feng Qiuyan said firmly.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I say before that you have to finish the plan I tailor-made for you before you can proceed to the next stage of cultivation…” Zhou Wen really didn’t wish to lie to Feng Qiuyan, so he could only find an excuse to reject him.</p>
<p>However, before he could finish speaking, Feng Qiuyan said, “Coach, I’ve already mastered the realm of the slow saber.”</p>
<p>“What? You’ve mastered it?” Zhou Wen widened his eyes as he looked at Feng Qiuyan in disbelief.</p>
<p>He had only said it in passing. Although he had included some of his insights, most of them were just random thoughts he pulled out of his ass. The fact that Feng Qiuyan had actually managed to master the realm of the slow saber realm with his nonsense, left Zhou Wen in disbelief.</p>
<p>“I’ve really mastered it. I’ll demonstrate it to you now.” Feng Qiuyan slashed at Zhou Wen with his saber.</p>
<p>In the past, Feng Qiuyan’s slashing of his saber was very quick, so fast that no one could see it clearly. It was like a bolt of lightning. It was extremely fast and agile.</p>
<p>His saber remained very fast, but it was so fast that it gave one a heavy feeling. It was as if there was immense weight on his saber, as if a mountain was pressing on it.</p>
<p>This saber move allowed others to see it clearly. It looked very slow, but in fact, its speed was even faster than before.</p>
<p>“You move as if you are raising a weighted feather!” Zhou Wen directly spoke of the feeling that Feng Qiuyan’s saber had given him.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan nodded and said, “As expected of Coach. You knew about this realm all along. If it wasn’t for your guidance, I don’t know how long it would have taken me to figure it out.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t able to describe his current feelings as he thought to himself, Feng Qiuyan, you are truly a genius. You actually managed to master something with that little said? What else can I say?</p>
<p>“Coach, please continue to tailor a cultivation plan for me,” Feng Qiuyan said solemnly to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Without waiting for Zhou Wen to say a word, Feng Qiuyan transferred the money to Zhou Wen. It was actually more than twenty thousand, three times more than the first lesson.</p>
<p>“Coach, I know that you aren’t doing it for this pittance, but this is just a form of my appreciation,” Feng Qiuyan said.</p>
<p>I’m doing it precisely for this pittance, alright? Zhou Wen was really in need of money, but he found the money to be a hot potato.</p>
<p>“I’ve been a little busy recently. I probably don’t have much time to tailor a plan for you…”Zhou Wen wanted to find an excuse to send Feng Qiuyan away.</p>
<p>However, Feng Qiuyan immediately said, “It’s alright. Coach, if you have time, give me some pointers. If you don’t have time, I can wait.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Feng Qiuyan with a complicated expression, momentarily at a loss for words. After a long hesitation, Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and said, “Feng Qiuyan, listen to me. In fact, from the beginning, I only wanted to earn a little bit of your money from teaching you. What I said to you previously was all nonsense. For you to master the realm of the slow saber is because you are talented and perceptive. It has nothing to do with me. I’m sorry; I’ll refund you the money you paid previously. I hope that you won’t take it to heart…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen really didn’t wish to lie to Feng Qiuyan. He told him the truth and would rather return the money to him than continue the lie.</p>
<p>However, Feng Qiuyan didn’t believe him at all. He stopped Zhou Wen from refunding him the money and said, “Coach, it’s fine if you don’t have time. I can wait. If you think my talent is too poor and don’t wish to teach me, it doesn’t matter. I’ll stay by your side. You don’t have to deliberately teach me. Just let me figure things out on my own.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t an eloquent person. He was at a loss for an explanation as he stammered, “That’s not what I meant…”</p>
<p>“Coach, you don’t have to say anything else. I know people like you are very diligent in your cultivation. You will definitely squeeze every minute and second for cultivation, or else you wouldn’t have improved so quickly. I was selfish to make you waste your time tailoring a plan for me. But other than you, I can’t tolerate those mediocre people who only teach following a fixed curriculum. So please do not reject me. I know that your time is precious, so you don’t have to do anything. Just let me be by your side and self-study. Don’t worry, I won’t affect your day-to-day life. I won’t disturb you when it’s inconvenient.” Feng Qiuyan’s eyes were steeled with resolve.</p>
<p>This person… must be crazy… Zhou Wen looked at Feng Qiuyan with his mouth agape. He realized that he had no way of explaining himself.</p>
<p>“I’m telling you that I really have nothing to teach you. Are you sure you want to stay?” Zhou Wen said feebly.</p>
<p>“Coach, don’t worry. I will definitely not disturb your cultivation,” Feng Qiuyan said firmly.</p>
<p>“As long as you’re happy. Let me make things clear. I have nothing to teach you. If you insist on staying, the money you gave me won’t be refunded,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I don’t usually use a lot of money. I haven’t used much of the allowance that my family gave me. There’s still about a million left. If you need it, you can take it all,” Feng Qiuyan said.</p>
<p>“There’s no need.” Zhou Wen shook his head helplessly as he went back inside and sat on the sofa to continue gaming.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan walked in and closed the door before following Zhou Wen, preparing to watch him play games.</p>
<p>“Do you want to watch me game too?” Zhou Wen put down his phone and asked Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>“I want to understand your entire cultivation process. Gaming is also part of your cultivation, right? What game are you playing? I want to download one too,” Feng Qiuyan said seriously. It was obvious that he wasn’t joking.</p>
<p>“This is a game I created myself. It hasn’t been completed yet, so it is a trade secret.” Zhou Wen felt like he was about to go mad.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan was obviously the one who had been deceived, but he, the deceiver, felt extremely depressed.</p>
<p>“I see.” Feng Qiuyan nodded and stopped watching him game. He walked to Zhou Wen and pulled a chair to sit down as he stared at him intently.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered with him. He believed that Feng Qiuyan would leave once he was bored, so he decided to ignore him. Since Feng Qiuyan couldn’t see what game he was playing, he continued gaming and grinding the game’s instance dungeons.</p>
<h3 id='chapter159'>Chapter 159 True Grinding</h3>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen was grinding the Ant Nest. When he arrived in the Ant City again, he immediately switched his Primordial Energy Art to the Dao Sutra. His Life Providence also changed to Dao Body, giving him immense augmentation to his Primordial Energy recovery rate.</p>
<p>At the same time, he got the blood-colored avatar to summon the Banana Fairy in her fan-like state. Seeing the swarm of black-winged flying ants charging at him, he swatted the fan at them.</p>
<p>The dozen or so black-winged flying ants in front of him were immediately sent flying. The cold wind caused their bodies to freeze into ice sculptures. When they were hit, they immediately shattered into broken limbs that fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Following the dozen or so notifications that a black-winged flying ant had been killed, a dimensional crystal dropped on the ground.</p>
<p>Awesome. This is what it means to grind. Zhou Wen summoned the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior, Mutated Demonized General, the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant, and the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, but he didn’t let them attack. All he did was put up a battle formation for defense, preventing the horde of black-winged flying ants from approaching the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>The Three-Eyed Golden Warrior took point as the swarm of black-winged flying ants failed to injure its Golden Body. It occupied the space of nearly half the black-winged flying ants.</p>
<p>The other Companion Beasts also used their own strengths to prevent the ant swarm from approaching the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>However, there were just too many black-winged flying ants. In just a few seconds, a large group had gathered and were on the brink of breaking through the defensive perimeter.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at the blood-colored avatar’s Primordial Energy. Under the effects of the Dao Body, his Primordial Energy had recovered to the maximum of 18 points. Without any hesitation, he swatted his fan again.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>A large group of ants was sent flying as they slammed into each other, shattering to pieces. The notifications of black-winged flying ants being killed flooded the screen.</p>
<p>Under the protection of the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior and other Companion Beasts, the blood-colored avatar delivered a gust of cold wind every few seconds. The immense numbers of black-winged ants couldn’t withstand such a slaughter. In less than half an hour, the massive Ant City had almost no black-winged flying ants left.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to charge into Ant City. All kinds of ants crawled out of the nest in an attempt to attack him, but a large swath of them was killed by the Great Yin Wind.</p>
<p>There were shiny dimensional crystals on the ground, mixed with Companion Eggs. It was a spectacular sight that Zhou Wen had never seen before.</p>
<p>Awesome! How awesome! Zhou Wen led the group of Companion Beasts to storm through Ant City, leaving a river of blood in his wake. He didn’t even have time to pick up the dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs that dropped.</p>
<p>Kill! Kill! Kill!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immersed himself in a frenzy, slaughtering every ant he saw. He wanted to massacre Ant City before heading to the tallest ant nest and fight the Golden Flying Ant so as to drink the honey inside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that the number of Legendary creatures he killed in less than an hour was more than the number of Legendary creatures he had killed previously combined. Just from the dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs that shimmered on the ground, he knew how mind-blowing the number of ants he had killed was.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder that the powerful family clans will become stronger, but it’s so difficult for the weak to become stronger. Once one’s strength reaches a certain level, it’s too easy to earn resources, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>While he was crazily gaming and killing monsters, Feng Qiuyan, who was sitting opposite him, kept staring at him. His eyes never left him.</p>
<p>For a person as hardworking as Coach, his gaming must be a form of cultivation, but what’s the point of cultivating in such a way? Although Feng Qiuyan couldn’t figure out the outcome, he firmly believed that Zhou Wen’s actions had his reasons and meaning, so he continued staring at him.</p>
<p>As Feng Qiuyan was pondering over the matter, the antelope that had been sleeping on the couch woke up. It jumped down from the couch and bleated at Zhou Wen a few times. It meant that it was hungry and wanted Zhou Wen to prepare food for it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was engrossed in the game and completely ignored it.</p>
<p>It was extremely unhappy as it stomped on the ground with its hooves, as though it was tap dancing</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhou Wen wasn’t paying any attention to it, the antelope circled around Zhou Wen and jumped around him. It even nudged its head into his embrace, hoping to attract his attention and get him to prepare food.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was very familiar with the antelope and knew that it typically didn’t use violence. Furthermore, he was at a critical moment in his grinding, so he had no time to deal with it. No matter how much of a fuss it made, he ignored it.</p>
<p>As Feng Qiuyan watched, his eyes suddenly lit up. I understand now. Coach is practicing the cultivation of one’s mind. In such an environment, he can still focus on gaming. He’s not affected by any external factors or objects. This realm of single-mindedness is the optimal state for cultivation.</p>
<p>I see… So that’s how it is… I understand what I should do next… Feng Qiuyan leaped up and bowed slightly at Zhou Wen. “Coach, I understand. I’ll start my cultivation now. When I reach the same realm as you, I’ll seek your advice again.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t respond and continued gaming as though he hadn’t heard him. Feng Qiuyan didn’t mind as he turned around and left Zhou Wen’s dorm.</p>
<p>After glancing at Feng Qiuyan, a puzzled expression appeared on the antelope’s face. It had no idea what had happened to the person; he had acted like a madman.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan walked out excitedly, but as he walked, he slowed down.</p>
<p>How do I cultivate the way to having a calm mind? Just as Feng Qiuyan was thinking, he saw a person walking towards him. On careful look, it was Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Feng Qiuyan, why are you here at Zhou Wen’s place?” Li Xuan asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan’s eyes lit up as he quickly came to Li Xuan. Without answering him, he asked, “Li Xuan, you have the best relationship with Coach. Do you know how he usually cultivates to be completely single-minded?”</p>
<p>“What single-minded? That fellow, Old Zhou, is like a fool when he’s gaming. He doesn’t hear a thing,” Li Xuan said casually.</p>
<p>“That’s right. What kind of disturbance practice does he do when he’s gaming?” Feng Qiuyan hurriedly said.</p>
<p>“Is there a need for practice? When he’s gaming, he isn’t distracted at all. In the past, I had a pretty chick tempt him while he was gaming, but guess what happened in the end? That punk acted as though he couldn’t see that chick at all. When that girl stopped him from playing, he threw her to the ground with a slap and continued gaming…” Li Xuan said as his saliva splattered.</p>
<p>So one needs to get past lust first? Feng Qiuyan’s eyes lit up as though he had figured out something.</p>
<p>However, when Feng Qiuyan thought about it, he realized that this was Sunset College. There was no way he could find such a woman to practice with. Instantly, he felt a little stumped.</p>
<p>“Do you know anywhere that has women? The kind that are very noisy,” Feng Qiuyan asked, having heard from Li Xuan that he had previously found women for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Very noisy women… There really is one…” When Li Xuan saw how oddly Feng Qiuyan was behaving, he had the intention of pulling his leg.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan was delighted when Li Xuan said yes. He immediately got Li Xuan to take him there and followed him to Li Weiyang’s club.</p>
<h3 id='chapter160'>Chapter 160 Battling the Golden Flying Ant Again</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know how long he had been grinding. As the massive Ant City was only left with a tiny number of ants, there was no need for him to use the Grand Yin Wind again. Just the Mutated Demonized General could easily finish them off.</p>
<p>Seeing dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs drop everywhere in Ant City, Zhou Wen’s excitement suddenly waned.</p>
<p>Despite killing black-winged flying ants, red-armored ants, blue-armored ants, and so on, they were only at the ordinary Legendary stage. Their limit was 18, so the dimensional crystals they dropped were at most 18, and the number was extremely few.</p>
<p>Crystals with such stats were of no use to Zhou Wen. Only the Primordial Energy Crystals could be used to replenish his Primordial Energy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart bled as he saw the large number of stats crystals wasted.</p>
<p>However, he couldn’t take anything in the game out. If he could sell the stats crystal he obtained from grinding, it would be enough for him to invest in Huang Ji’s game.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored ordinary stats crystals and focused on picking up the Companion Eggs and Primordial Energy Skill Crystals.</p>
<p>He had reaped quite a sizable harvest this time. Just the Legendary Companion Eggs numbered 14 and the Primordial Energy Skill Crystals numbered 21. However, most of them were repeated. There were only two unique types of Primordial Energy Skills.</p>
<p>One of them was the black-winged flying ant’s Primordial Energy Skill. Zhou Wen had previously obtained this, but the other was something he hadn’t collected before. It was dropped by the red-armored ants that couldn’t fly. Its name was Concealed Armor Technique; it was also a defensive Primordial Energy Skill.</p>
<p>Companion Eggs with poor attributes were fed to the pets. Those with good attributes were hatched since Zhou Wen planned on keeping them for fusion later.</p>
<p>With most of the ants in Ant City killed, the Golden Flying Ant remained inside the ant nest high up. Zhou Wen made sure he was in optimal state by filling up his Companion Beasts’ and blood-colored avatar’s Primordial Energy before heading for the ant nest at the top.</p>
<p>It was different from before. This time, Zhou Wen had brought a large number of helpers over. He wasn’t as wretched as he used to be, nor was there any ant horde besieging him.</p>
<p>Even if I can’t kill the Golden Flying Ant, it won’t be difficult to drink some Golden Ant Honey. Zhou Wen didn’t believe he could kill the Golden Flying Ant with his current strength.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the apex of the ant nest, he directly ordered the Mutated Demonized General and the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior to charge in. They were the only ones who could tank, especially the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior. It could withstand blows the best, so Zhou Wen planned on using them to attract the Golden Flying Ant’s attention so that he could rush in and drink the honey.</p>
<p>Indeed, the moment the duo charged in after smashing through the nest’s walls, they immediately attracted the Golden Flying Ant’s attention. With a flash of golden light, a gigantic flying ant appeared above their heads. Its sharp claws slashed straight at the Mutated Demonized General’s head.</p>
<p>The Mutated Demonized General roared angrily as it delivered Astral Fist. Its entire body glowed with golden light as it punched at the Golden Flying Ant’s claws.</p>
<p>But the next second, Zhou Wen saw a golden beam flash. One of the Mutated Demonized General’s arm flew up into the air, having been sliced off by the Golden Flying Ant.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, it’s that powerful! Zhou Wen was alarmed as he didn’t dare hesitate any further. He controlled his remaining pets to charge at the Golden Flying Ant as the blood-colored avatar jumped into the ant honey and began gulping mouthfuls of honey.</p>
<p>After a few mouthfuls, the game produced a notification: ‘Absorbed Golden Ant Honey. Primordial Energy +1’</p>
<p>His Primordial Energy finally raised from the limit of 18 to 19.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted as he continued drinking the ant honey, hoping to directly break through to 21 points.</p>
<p>However, despite filling his stomach to the point of not being able to swallow any further, he didn’t receive a notification of his Primordial Energy raising to 20 points, much less 21 points.</p>
<p>Could it be that I haven’t drunk enough? Zhou Wen cloyed from the excessive sweetness. Perhaps just opening his move would make him vomit honey. He just couldn’t continue drinking.</p>
<p>On the other side, Zhou Wen’s pets had been mercilessly killed by the Golden Flying Ant aside from the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior.</p>
<p>There was a deep wound on the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior’s chest. Despite having Golden Body and Invulnerable Golden Power, it was still heavily injured. The Golden Flying Ant’s strength was extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>Seeing it rush over again, the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior was unable to duck the speedy attack. All it could do was use Golden Palm to meet it.</p>
<p>With a cracking sound, the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior’s palm was cleaved apart. His body involuntarily flew backward and crashed into the cocoon hanging in the middle of the ant nest.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the Golden Flying Ant phased away and appeared in front of the gigantic cocoon in a flash. It used its body to block the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior from crashing into the gigantic cocoon.</p>
<p>When the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior collided with the Golden Flying Ant, it was sent flying to the side. The latter immediately charged forward in an attempt to slay the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he controlled the blood-colored avatar. He raised the banana fan and waved it at the gigantic cocoon, sending a cold gust of wind over.</p>
<p>The Golden Flying Ant that was charging at the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior immediately flew back. A strange golden barrier shot out from its body to protect the gigantic cocoon.</p>
<p>The Grand Yin Wind collided with the golden barrier, but only trembled it a little. The barrier remained unbroken.</p>
<p>In the next second, the two feelers on the Golden Flying Ant’s head emitted a terrifying golden light. Like a golden lightning bolt, they struck the blood-colored avatar, and the screen of the cell phone turned black.</p>
<p>The Golden Flying Ant is undoubtedly at the Epic stage, but I wonder what’s inside the gigantic cocoon? Logically speaking, it should be the descendant of the Golden Flying Ant, but its energy aura seems different from the Golden Flying Ant.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was puzzled, he didn’t have the ability to kill the Golden Flying Ant. Even if he wanted to explore the secret of the gigantic cocoons, he couldn’t.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I only managed to increase my Primordial Energy by one point despite drinking so much of the ant honey. I wonder if there’s a limit to how much it can raise my Primordial Energy or if there are other reasons. Zhou Wen was truly exhausted today. Although he still had plenty of Primordial Energy, the repeated use of Grand Yin Wind over long periods of time left him mentally exhausted.</p>
<p>After putting away his phone, Zhou Wen saw the antelope glaring at him as though he wanted to eat him up.</p>
<p>“Brother Antelope, I’m sorry. I’ll go get you some food now.” Zhou Wen hurriedly ran out of the building and prepared to eat something before bringing back some fresh vegetables for the antelope.</p>
<p>When he reached the entrance of Four Seasons Garden, he met Wang Lu and the other special admissions students.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t familiar with the other special admissions students, so he only greeted Wang Lu before heading to the cafeteria.</p>
<p>A special admissions student named Li Zhuo said with a smile, “Zhou Wen, have you sold the Bronze Luck Beast strategy yet?”</p>
<p>“No,” Zhou Wen answered before heading straight to the cafeteria. He didn’t have the time for idle chats.</p>
<h3 id='chapter161'>Chapter 161 Who’s First?</h3>
<p>“It would be a wonder if he could sell it. In terms of Companion Beasts, we are indeed not as strong as him. Unfortunately, Restriction City doesn’t allow the use of Companion Beasts. Who needs his strategy?” Li Zhuo pursed his lips as he watched Zhou Wen leave.</p>
<p>The girl beside him added, “He thinks he’s very strong just because he defeated John, but it was all because of his Companion Beasts. To write a strategy guide and sell it to our special class is indeed excessively arrogant.”</p>
<p>“Let’s not talk about the geniuses like An Jing, Wang Lu, or Feng Qiuyan in our special class, even the average ones are far superior to the students of the ordinary classes. If he wants to write a strategy guide, it will be us writing for them.”</p>
<p>The few special admissions students shared the same thought. They still felt a little displeased that Zhou Wen had tried selling them the strategy guide. It had hurt their pride.</p>
<p>Wang Lu frowned slightly and said, “Zhou Wen is indeed a genius. The guide he wrote must have something to learn from. However, we aren’t buying it because we want to train ourselves, so there’s no need to belittle him.”</p>
<p>Li Zhuo laughed and said, “Wang Lu, you are overthinking things. We have no intention of disparaging him. We are just saying that no one is weaker than him in terms of their own abilities. There’s no need to buy his strategy.”</p>
<p>Wang Lu could tell that Li Zhuo was insincere, but she didn’t say anything else.</p>
<p>The few of them headed for class together. The mission to slay the Bronze Luck Beasts had been completed, so Liu Zhengyan was to provide them a summary and explanation. All the special admissions students had to attend the class.</p>
<p>Liu Zhengyan was in a good mood today. He didn’t blame Feng Qiuyan or another student for being late. He only waved his hand to get them to quickly take their seats.</p>
<p>“Mr. Liu seems to be in a good mood today. He didn’t reprimand the late students!” a girl said in surprise.</p>
<p>Shaking his head, Li Zhuo said with a smile, “Of course he’s in a good mood. Our special class did a good job with the homework mission. I heard that a few of us broke the special class record from last year.”</p>
<p>“Seems like we can relax for a while.” The girl from before smiled.</p>
<p>Liu Zhengyan raised his hand slightly to signal for the students to quieten down. Then, he swept his gaze across everyone’s faces and said slowly, “Everyone has completed the homework mission of killing Bronze Luck Beasts. Compared to the special classes of past years, the overall standard of this class is a level higher. It can be considered the best result in recent years.”</p>
<p>The students started clapping. Many students showed their excitement. Having been in school for more than a month, this was the first time they heard Liu Zhengyan praise them.</p>
<p>Liu Zhengyan waved his hand and waited for the students to quieten down before continuing, “This year, a few students performed pretty well. They broke the records from previous years. An Jing with 3:20. Wang Lu with 3:27, and Feng Qiuyan with 3:28. Such results can be said to be extremely outstanding.”</p>
<p>The other students looked at the three of them enviously. Although they had already known that the three of them were exceptionally outstanding-even in the special class—they couldn’t help but feel jealous.</p>
<p>“But…” Liu Zhengyan suddenly changed the topic and continued, “But this year’s best result wasn’t scored by any of them.”</p>
<p>“How is that possible? Who else could it be? Is there anyone else in our class who has better results than them?”</p>
<p>“It can’t be, right? There are hidden big shots that are more impressive than the three of them?”</p>
<p>“That’s impossible, isn’t it? An Jing, Wang Lu, and Feng Qiuyan are among the top ten students in the school. Even if the other students are very strong, they aren’t good enough to enter the top ten. It seems impossible for anyone to have better results than the three of them.”</p>
<p>The students engaged in a flurry of discussion. They looked around and wondered who that person was.</p>
<p>“The person who obtained the best results in killing the Bronze Luck Beast this year isn’t from our special class.” The students’ discussion became even more intense after Liu Zhengyan said those shocking words.</p>
<p>“Mr. Liu, don’t tell me you’re talking about our seniors?” Li Zhuo couldn’t help but ask loudly.</p>
<p>Liu Zhengyan smiled and looked at Li Zhuo. He asked, “Li Zhuo, who do you think should be first and what’s his timing?”</p>
<p>“I think it should be Senior Wei Ge. I believe that if it were Senior Wei Ge, he should be able to do it in sub-three minutes,” said Li Zhuo.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Wei Ge got 2:57. It happens to be within three minutes. You are very keen,” Liu Zhengyan said.</p>
<p>Li Zhuo said proudly, “Mr. Li, you flatter me. I was just making a casual guess. I didn’t expect to be on the mark.”</p>
<p>Liu Zhengyan smiled. “But that’s Wei Ge’s results when he was practicing. Besides, he’s already in his third year, so he’s not within the rankings of you freshmen. The freshman in first place is someone else.”</p>
<p>“Who is it?” Li Zhuo couldn’t help but be dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Liu Zhengyan picked up a dossier and said, “The results for this year’s killing of Bronze Luck Beasts puts Zhou Wen from Counselor Wang Fei’s class as first. Second is Li Xuan from her class as well. Third place is our class’s An Jing…”</p>
<p>“Impossible!” Li Zhuo cried out in disbelief.</p>
<p>This time, it wasn’t just Li Zhuo and the other students. Even An Jing, Wang Lu, and Feng Qiuyan’s eyes narrowed as they looked at Liu Zhengyan.</p>
<p>“What’s Zhou Wen’s timing?” An Jing suddenly asked.</p>
<p>“That’s a good question. You can guess what their results are,” Liu Zhengyan said with a smile.</p>
<p>“It’s at best an order of magnitude from An Jing, right?” suggested Li Zhuo.</p>
<p>“It’s indeed an order of magnitude.” Liu Zhengyan turned on the player and projector and played a video. “See for yourself.”</p>
<p>Everyone cast their gaze to the big screen. An Jing, Feng Qiuyan, and the others also had their eyes peeled to the screen as they watched the video carefully.</p>
<p>The video was very short and only took less than a minute. However, after watching the video, the entire classroom fell silent. Li Zhuo and the others broke out into a cold sweat as they stared intently at the big screen. They failed to regain their cognitive abilities for a long time, and their faces were blank.</p>
<p>Coach lives up to being a coach. What amazing positioning. Is this all the benefits of gaming while practicing to be undistracted? Looks like I still need further cultivation. Feng Qiuyan’s eyes were burning, but he seemed to have expected it.</p>
<p>Wang Lu was somewhat astonished as well. Although she had expected Zhou Wen’s results to be excellent, she never expected them to be this good. It only took him forty-seven seconds.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was indeed faster than them by an order of magnitude, but this order was at the level of minutes.</p>
<p>An Jing looked at the screen calmly, but her expression was a little odd. It was unknown what she was thinking.</p>
<p>“Mr. Liu, are these results real? This is a strategy designed by the counselors before getting Zhou Wen to carry it out, right?” Li Zhuo still found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, no counselor participated in the design of this strategy. The strategy was written by Zhou Wen and Li Xuan. I also spent money on the discussion forums to read their monetized thread before I learned that there was such a method to kill Bronze Luck Beasts. Such a line of thinking and design can be said to be unique. To resolve a problem from a weakling’s point of view, relying on intelligence and not strength is very difficult. Today, we will be discussing in detail the ingenuity of the design and their unique line of thinking. I believe all of you will learn plenty from it, especially their thoughts on solving the problem. Strength might not be the only solution to resolving problems. This is very important…”</p>
<h3 id='chapter162'>Chapter 162 Restriction City Activity</h3>
<p>Li Xuan organized another event for the Xuanwen Club. Zhou Wen originally thought that not many people would turn up. If Gu Dian didn’t come, there would at most be four people, but when he arrived, he realized that there were more people than he imagined.</p>
<p>Fang Ruoxi and Tian Xiangdong were there as well. Gu Dian had also come. Apart from the original five people from the Xuanwen Club, there were also Feng Qiuyan, Wang Lu, Li Weiyang, and Hui Haifeng.</p>
<p>Li Xuan chuckled and said, “The club’s event is a joint activity between our Xuanwen Club, Weiyang Club, and the Ocean Club. Furthermore, our Xuanwen Club has added two more formal members. They are Feng Qiuyan and Wang Lu.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He had been gaming permanently for the past few days and had not paid any attention to the situation regarding the Xuanwen Club. Only then did he realize that Feng Qiuyan and Wang Lu had been roped into the Xuanwen Club by Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Li Xuan had set his sights on Restriction City. The group headed for the city with great fanfare.</p>
<p>The Weiyang Club consisted of only girls while the Ocean Club was mainly boys. Furthermore, they were all infamous problematic students in school. With Li Xuan and Zhou Wen’s Xuanwen Club having some odd ones out, this group quickly attracted the attention of the school.</p>
<p>The first person to receive the news was Wei Ge. As the president of Sunset College’s student council, he acutely believed that this matter was somewhat unusual. Perhaps it represented future trends of the students of Sunset College.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng and his gang are actually so close to Zhou Wen and Li Xuan. Wang Lu and Feng Qiuyan from the special class all have large families backing them, so they haven’t joined any clubs. Now, they have joined the Xuanwen Club and that strange Gu Dian has joined them too. Will the Xuanwen Club become the second Ocean Club in the future? No, I have to see what those people are up to. Wei Ge quickly gathered student councilors and joined the Xuanwen Club’s activities in the name of maintaining order and keeping the students safe. Together, they entered Restriction City with Li Xuan and company.</p>
<p>Due to the addition of the student council, the group once again grew bigger—there were already more than 50 people. After the group entered Restriction City, they directly stormed the area. The ordinary bronze beasts and bronze birds couldn’t withstand the slaughtering of so many students.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Feng Qiuyan, who loved to use his saber, didn’t take action this time. He was gaming on his phone just like Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that the game Feng Qiuyan was playing was a mini-game called “Last 20 Seconds If You Are A Man.” The game was very simple, but it wasn’t easy to maintain 20 seconds in the game without dying.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw Feng Qiuyan gaming, the latter had already lasted more than a minute. However, he still failed to escape the fate of death.</p>
<p>As there were so many students, and many of them were extremely powerful seniors, the originally dangerous Restriction City seemed to become a tourist attraction. Even the Bronze Luck Beasts were quickly cleared.</p>
<p>Wang Lu had even used Zhou Wen’s strategy to kill one. Indeed, she had easily improved her results to less than a minute.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, I think highly of you. If you join the student council now, there’s a high chance of becoming the president of the student council. Think about it,” Wei Ge said to Zhou Wen when they were alone.</p>
<p>“I’m fine as is. Besides, I only like gaming. I can’t be president,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“No one was born to be one. Just take your time to learn. You don’t have to be in a hurry to answer me. Think about it first,” Wei Ge said with a smile.</p>
<p>Seeing Hui Haifeng walk over, Wei Ge didn’t wish to meet him. He bade Zhou Wen farewell and left.</p>
<p>“Did Wei Ge tell you that he thinks highly of you and wants you to join the student council to work with him? And when he leaves in the future, you will be the president of the student council?” Hui Haifeng walked to Zhou Wen’s side and said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. Although his words were somewhat different, they had the same meaning.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng smiled and said, “There’s no need to be surprised. That punk is like that. He has said those words to almost every single member of the Ocean Club.”</p>
<p>“I see.” Zhou Wen was enlightened as he finally understood why Hui Haifeng had guessed Wei Ge’s words so accurately.</p>
<p>“I’ve read your Bronze Luck Beast strategy. It’s truly impressive. It has nothing to do with your combat strength. It’s the kind of planning ability that can calculate such shortcuts in chaotic environments that can avoid the sacrifice of many soldiers when exploring new dimensional zones,” Hui Haifeng said.</p>
<p>“You plan on joining the army in the future?” Zhou Wen asked Hui Haifeng.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng nodded. “If there’s a chance, I’ll join the army. If there’s no chance, I’ll work on something related. If a man can’t do something jaw-dropping his entire life, I feel like life would have been lived in vain.”</p>
<p>“I wish you success.” Although Zhou Wen didn’t share the same views, it didn’t stop him from appreciating such a person. At the very least, he had a good impression of Hui Haifeng.</p>
<p>Everyone kept storming into Restriction City as all sorts of bronze beasts were killed. Unfortunately, the drop rates of the bronze beasts were too low. It would only produce a single dimensional crystal occasionally. Furthermore, their attributes were generally not high.</p>
<p>As he walked forward, Zhou Wen suddenly felt the mysterious phone in his pocket vibrate. It left him somewhat taken aback.</p>
<p>He had already found the tiny palm print of Restriction City and had downloaded it into his phone. Why was the mysterious phone still vibrating?</p>
<p>Seeing that no one was paying attention to him, Zhou Wen deliberately stayed at the back. He took out the mysterious phone, wanting to know why it was vibrating.</p>
<p>As soon as he took out the phone, the camera was automatically activated.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen raised his phone and looked around the city. When a scene appeared on his screen, the camera app automatically locked onto it. A green frame appeared that enclosed something on the screen.</p>
<p>It was an old and worn wall. At a glance, it seemed as though there was nothing different about it. There was nothing different about it from the brick walls beside it.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen walked to the side of the brick wall and touched it with his hand, he realized that the brick wall wasn’t made of ordinary brick, but some kind of metal.</p>
<p>The mysterious phone’s camera function was only locked onto the metal wall, but it didn’t automatically take pictures or lock onto any patterns. Zhou Wen was momentarily unsure of what was so special about the metal wall.</p>
<p>It was a part of a particular building, but the structure was somewhat odd. It was squarish, like a miniature ancient city.</p>
<p>The four walls of the city were only about ten meters tall. Zhou Wen circled the building but didn’t find any doors or windows.</p>
<p>Using his ability to fly thanks to the Godfiend Life Providence, he flew to the top of the building and discovered that the roof was sealed as well. The entire building didn’t seem to have an entrance.</p>
<p>Can it be that the item that causes the mysterious phone to vibrate is inside the building and not the metal wall itself? Zhou Wen wondered.</p>
<h3 id='chapter163'>Chapter 163 Death City</h3>
<p>“What did you discover?” Wang Lu jumped up and sized up the building beneath her.</p>
<p>“This building is a little odd. There aren’t any entrances or windows around it. Furthermore, it doesn’t seem to use ordinary bricks. It seems to be made from a special type of bronze,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“It’s indeed a little odd.” Wang Lu crouched down to touch it and nodded. “Its metal. It’s indeed a little strange.”</p>
<p>Their actions attracted Li Xuan and the company. Wang Lu explained the situation and everyone agreed that the building was strange.</p>
<p>“All of you, move aside. Let me try and see if I can smash it open.” A stout boy from the Ocean Club struck down at the metal wall with a huge hammer.</p>
<p>The boy was at the Legendary stage, and he was a Strength-type. He had also used his metal hammer that had Primordial Gold mixed in, combined with his Primordial Energy Skill, to strike the wall. Even if the wall was made of metal bricks, he should have been able to smash open a crack.</p>
<p>However, not only did he fail to blast through the metal wall, he even fell to the ground from the recoil. The hammer in his hand flew out of his hand, and his hands were dripping with blood. The area between his thumb and index finger had torn.</p>
<p>“It’s so hard!” Everyone was shocked. The boy was famous for his Strength in school, but due to his poor Speed, he was unable to enter the top ten.</p>
<p>In terms of strength alone, he would probably be ranked in the top three. For the Full-Strength strike from such a person to fail to scratch the surface of the metal wall made it clear that it was truly extraordinary.</p>
<p>This only intrigued everyone further. They tried a variety of methods, but unfortunately, they failed to succeed in seeing what was inside.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Wen used Truth Listener’s powers. He wanted to hear what was inside, but the interior of the building seemed to be a chunk of solid mass. There wasn’t any movement at all. Zhou Wen couldn’t hear a thing from the dead silence.</p>
<p>“That’s Death City.” A voice suddenly sounded.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked in the direction of the voice and saw that the person speaking was a long-haired boy. His looks were ordinary, but he looked refined. He had a scholarly air to him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hadn’t noticed him in the beginning perhaps because of his reticent temperament that didn’t attract much attention among the students.</p>
<p>“Jiang Yan, this strange building is called Death City? Do you know its origins?” Wei Ge asked him.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan was a member of the student council, but he didn’t look like one of the key members. He was probably just an ordinary member, so no one had noticed him before.</p>
<p>“In the Zhou dynasty, while humans were still confined to the borders of undeveloped barbaric behavior, many people believed in ghosts and gods, and it was very common for them to carry out rituals to worship the heavens. The funeral rituals were also very particular, especially the members of the royal family back then. In the later years of the Eastern Zhou dynasty, King Zhou became afraid of death. He built Death City and placed his bones and blood in it, hoping that by indicating his passing, he could hide from the heavens and escape death. Unfortunately, heaven’s will couldn’t be violated. He ultimately died.” Jiang Yan’s eyes flashed a look of mockery.</p>
<p>After a pause, Jiang Yan continued, “According to the few historical records, Death City is made of bronze, with no doors or windows…”</p>
<p>Hearing Jiang Yan’s words, everyone was increasingly convinced that this strange bronze building was the legendary Death City.</p>
<p>“I thought it was something good, but it turns out it’s just a fake grave. It only spells bad luck,” a boy said.</p>
<p>“That might not be the case,” said Jiang Yan indifferently. “In order to fool the ghosts and gods, King Zhou didn’t only put his bones and blood in Dead City; he also buried his personal items and treasures with him. There were even some brutal kings who would even bury their beloved concubines alive. In order to fool the ghosts and gods, he had put in much effort.”</p>
<p>“Does that mean that there might be treasures inside?” Many students’ eyes lit up when they heard that.</p>
<p>“If the history books are right, there will definitely be burial items inside. However, now that this place has turned into a dimensional zone, there might be some abnormal changes in it. It wouldn’t be surprising if it had dimensional creatures inside,” said Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>“Jiang Yan, do you know how to open Death City?” Wei Ge asked Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>It was his first time realizing that Jiang Yan had such a side to him, as though it was somewhat different from the person he knew before.</p>
<p>“Dig into the area beneath the south wall of Death City. If this is really East Zhou’s Death City, there should be an entrance there,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>Wei Ge arranged for people to dig according to Jiang Yan’s instructions. After a hole seven to eight feet deep was dug, they saw a hole appear on the metal wall.</p>
<p>After digging further down, a circular hole appeared. It was a tunnel that went all the way into Death City, but it was winding, making it impossible to see what was going on inside.</p>
<p>“Which one of us is willing to go in first and take a look?” Wei Ge said.</p>
<p>“I don’t know about others, but I’m definitely entering to take a look. However, I don’t want to be the first to enter,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>After a short discussion, Hui Haifeng was the first to enter. The four clubs sent a few people in.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally didn’t wish to enter, but Li Xuan pulled him inside. Soon, they heard Hui Haifeng’s voice from ahead. “Everyone, come on in. There’s no danger inside.”</p>
<p>By the time Zhou Wen and Li Xuan climbed in, Wei Ge, Hui Haifeng, Feng Qiuyan, Li Weiyang, and the company were already standing in Death City.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that he would see skeletons and coffins, but after entering, he realized that there was nothing of that sort. There was only a tree in the city.</p>
<p>The tree was about two meters tall. The branches and leaves were all black, but there were many thin white lines on them. It looked like a painting drawn in black and white.</p>
<p>“Jiang Yan, what’s going on? Didn’t you say that this Death City has King Zhou’s bones and burial items? Why is there only this tree?” Wei Ge questioned Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan said indifferently, “I’ve already said that those are records in the history books. After the dimensional storms, it’s normal to have abnormal changes inside.”</p>
<p>“Then do you know what tree this is?” someone asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Jiang Yan replied straightforwardly.</p>
<p>Everyone was somewhat disappointed. Even though they didn’t really have any hopes of digging up any treasures, learning that there was only one tree in there wiped away their curiosity instantly. They were somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>“What crappy tree is this? It caused us to waste so much time.” A member of the Ocean Club kicked the tree trunk unhappily.</p>
<p>With this kick, the pitch-black tree swayed and turned a bright white color. In the blink of an eye, the black tree had turned completely white.</p>
<h3 id='chapter164'>Chapter 164 The Color-Changing Tree</h3>
<p>The originally black tree turned snow-white in an instant. Everyone was shocked and retreated warily.</p>
<p>However, other than turning snow-white, the tree did not undergo any other changes, nor was there any danger.</p>
<p>After a while, the white tree gradually turned black again, as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>“This tree is a little strange. It’s clearly a black tree, so why did it suddenly turn white?” Li Xuan was extremely curious as he held a wooden stick and stabbed it a few times.</p>
<p>However, the black tree remained black without any changes from before.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen aimed his mysterious phone at the black tree and the camera function immediately locked onto it. Clearly, it was the tree that had caused the mysterious phone to vibrate.</p>
<p>He pressed the shutter button and the phone immediately entered the picture-taking interface.</p>
<p>Quite a number of people were using their cell phones to illuminate the area as well as taking pictures of the black tree. Zhou Wen’s actions didn’t seem too out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>As there was no danger, someone boldly shook the black tree. In the next second, the black tree had turned into a ruby-like color. It was like a gem in the shape of a tree, shimmering with a dazzling glow of riches.</p>
<p>The person shaking the tree was a girl. This scene gave her a shock and she hurriedly retreated.</p>
<p>Just like before, nothing dangerous happened. The red gem tree gradually lost its luster and soon returned to its dark appearance.</p>
<p>“This is really strange.” Li Xuan seemed to have thought of something as he carefully shook the black tree with his hand. Indeed, the black tree had changed color again. However, it was different from the previous few colors. This time, the black tree had turned golden.</p>
<p>“It seems like the color will be different depending on the person,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Let me give it a try.” Everyone was curious as they attempted to shake the black tree.</p>
<p>Indeed, just as Li Xuan said, when different people touched the black tree, it would transform into another color. Even if it changed to red, the red itself was a different shade.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, try it too,” Li Xuan said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. I don’t like to take risks. It’s best you don’t touch it.” Zhou Wen shook his head. Before figuring out what the black tree was, he was unwilling to touch it.</p>
<p>The phone was still in the middle of downloading, and the download speed seemed much slower than before.</p>
<p>After the crowd had their fun, they realized that the black tree didn’t have any other function other than changing colors. Soon, they were bored with it.</p>
<p>As there was nothing else here, everyone left Death City and continued exploring Restriction City.</p>
<p>The mysterious phone was still in the middle of downloading. It didn’t finish even when the club activity ended and everyone left together.</p>
<p>With the screen constantly downloading, Zhou Wen had no way of gaming. After returning to his dorm, he had a good nap-a rather rare opportunity.</p>
<p>Ever since he had advanced to the Legendary stage, the feeling of having sleep paralysis hadn’t happened again. Zhou Wen had a good nap and ended up waking the next morning. After washing up and eating, he realized that the download had been completed when he unlocked the mysterious phone. There was a tree-shaped icon on the home screen.</p>
<p>However, the cartoon-styled icon looked different from the black tree. There were three words “Dead Man Tree” written below.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat curious as to why a tree had an instance dungeon. He immediately tapped on the tree’s icon.</p>
<p>After launching the app, the scene turned black. In the dark space, there was a tree-a black one. However, in the dark cavern, one could clearly see the tree’s appearance.</p>
<p>Apart from its cartoon-styled appearance, it was the black tree they had encountered in Death City.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar stood in front of it, but apart from the black tree, there was nothing around it. Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss as to what the instance dungeon was for.</p>
<p>He summoned the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and let it fly towards the black tree. He then attacked the black tree with Magical Needle which stabbed into it but failed to penetrate it. He wasn’t able to damage the black tree at all either.</p>
<p>The tree didn’t react and remained standing quietly in the darkness.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hesitated for a moment before deciding to let the blood-colored avatar personally touch the tree to see if there would be any abnormal changes.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen found it strange that after the blood-colored avatar touched it, the color of the black tree did not change. It was still black, completely the same as before.</p>
<p>Strange, why didn’t the color change? Zhou Wen remembered that in Death City, the black tree had undergone a change in color when people touched it. Nothing like what had happened to him was experienced in game.</p>
<p>Is it me or is it a problem with the game? Zhou Wen was momentarily unsure of what the tree was for, nor did he understand the use of the instance dungeon. All he could do was ignore it for the time being. After quitting the game, he logged into other dungeons to hunt monsters.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen only grinded two types of monsters. One was mutated Legendary monsters since only they could drop stats crystals above 18 points which were of use to him.</p>
<p>Another was Epic creatures that could drop stats crystals that exceeded 20 points. They were similarly useful to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, Epic creatures were too powerful. He was no match for the few Epic creatures Zhou Wen encountered in-game, so all he could do was search for the mutated Legendary creatures.</p>
<p>In a room at the An family’s residence in Luoyang, An Tianzuo had recently returned home.</p>
<p>“Tianzuo, has the situation around Luoyang been very bad recently?” Ouyang Lan asked worriedly.</p>
<p>“It’s not that bad. Apart from the problematic matters at the Qihe River, there aren’t too many problems in other places,” said An Tianzuo with a smile. “Mom, don’t worry. As long as I’m in Luoyang, I won’t let those dimensional creatures invade Luoyang.”</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan nodded slightly and sighed before saying, “The Holy Land qualification competition is just around the corner. If Zhou Wen goes alone, I won’t be at ease. Let Ah Sheng accompany him, right?”</p>
<p>“Mom, are you really letting Zhou Wen go? Aren’t you going to reconsider?” An Tianzuo frowned.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan shook her head and said, “I know what you’re thinking. However, Xiaojing has a congenital illness. It would be terrifying if something were to happen to her during her acceptance of the special physique. I don’t want Little Jing to take any risks. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>“Understood.” An Tianzuo added, “But I believe that Little Jing can do it.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to elaborate on this matter. I’ve already made up my mind. Furthermore, the nomination has been changed to Zhou Wen. There’s no way to change it.” Ouyang Lan stopped An Tianzuo from continuing.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo remained silent. Although he didn’t agree with Ouyang Lan’s decision, he would not go against her wishes. He had always been a filial son.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan sighed lightly. “Besides, Zhou Wen might not be willing to go. He has no blood relationship with the two of you, but his temper is extraordinarily similar. He’s always so stubborn.”</p>
<p>“It’s different. He’s stubborn while we are confident,” said An Tianzuo proudly.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan only looked at An Tianzuo and smiled without saying another word.</p>
<h3 id='chapter165'>Chapter 165 Dead Man Tree</h3>
<p>An Jing huddled into a ball and leaned against the corner of the wall, enduring the pain that was like a knife being twisted inside her.</p>
<p>Why don’t people who can cultivate the Sun Strafe Art cherish it? I have to ensure such pain just to cultivate it. Why is Heaven so unfair to me? An Jing thought of Zhou Wen amidst the pain as she clenched her teeth, seemingly reducing the pain she felt.</p>
<p>She had a congenital disease, so she couldn’t cultivate Sun Strafe Art, a Primordial Energy Art which was highly yang in nature. However, if she failed to master the Sun Strafe Art, she would not be able to obtain the special physique she needed.</p>
<p>In the Holy Land, there were several special physiques. The special physiques that everyone could obtain were different, but they had to have the corresponding strength attributes to obtain the corresponding special physiques.</p>
<p>The special physique that An Jing wanted was the Sun God Body. If she could master the Sun Strafe Art, she would have an 80% chance of obtaining the Sun God Body if she stood out.</p>
<p>However, the Sun Strafe Art didn’t match her body’s attributes. When she cultivated the Sun Strafe Art, it would trigger her congenital illness. Every time she cultivated, she would feel like dying due to the excruciating pain.</p>
<p>An Jing didn’t give up because of this. Even though Ouyang Lan had forbidden her from cultivating the Sun Strafe Art, she still secretly endured it.</p>
<p>Even Ouyang Lan believed that An Jing had advanced to the Legendary stage by using another Primordial Energy Art. She never expected An Jing to endure extreme pain to advance to the Legendary stage with the Sun Strafe Art.</p>
<p>However, this matter was something An Jing had never told anyone. Even An Tianzuo wasn’t aware of it.</p>
<p>After completing the Sun Strafe Art’s cultivation, the pain in An Jing’s body gradually disappeared, making her complexion turn for the better.</p>
<p>After taking a shower and changing into a clean set of clothes, An Jing walked out of her dorm and arrived in front of her neighbor’s door. After a moment of hesitation, her eyes turned resolute as she pressed the doorbell of Zhou Wen’s dorm.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen opened the door and asked curiously when he saw An Jing standing outside.</p>
<p>“Do you still remember our three-month contract?” she asked calmly.</p>
<p>“I don’t remember.” Zhou Wen shook his head. It was only a one-sided statement by An Jing. He had never agreed to a three-month contract.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter whether you remember it or not. Although it’s not three months yet, since you’ve already advanced to the Legendary stage and have so many powerful pets, it will be a fair battle between us now. It’s time for us to end things,” An Jing said.</p>
<p>“I’m not interested in that special physique nomination. If you want it that much, I can accompany you to meet Sis Lan. Let me convince her to return the nomination to you,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>An Jing looked at Zhou Wen and suddenly felt extremely aggrieved. She had risked her life to obtain the nomination, but it was nothing of importance to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Suddenly, An Jing’s fighting spirit vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>So what if I defeat Zhou Wen? So what if I prove that I’m more outstanding than him? I still can’t go to the Holy Land to get the Sun God Body. An Jing felt like everything was meaningless.</p>
<p>Without looking at Zhou Wen again, An Jing turned and left, looking somewhat lost.</p>
<p>Strange person. Zhou Wen found it odd when he saw An Jing leave just like that.</p>
<p>However, since An Jing had automatically given up antagonizing him, it was naturally best for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, bad news.” Just as Zhou Wen was about to close the door and return to his room to continue gaming, he saw Li Xuan running over, panting</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“Something happened. Something big has happened.” Li Xuan gasped for breath as he said, “Someone died in our college. A few students died.”</p>
<p>“Did they die in the dimensional zones?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“No, they died in school. Furthermore, the people who died were people who joined us on our trip to Restriction City yesterday. Furthermore, all of them had entered Death City as well. That includes Wang Lu,” Li Xuan said with an odd expression.</p>
<p>“Wang Lu is dead? How did they die?” Zhou Wen was alarmed when he heard that.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Li Xuan shook his head.</p>
<p>“How do you not know?” Zhou Wen frowned slightly.</p>
<p>“I heard from the school’s management that they have yet to find out the cause of their deaths, nor do they know how they died. A few of them were walking when they suddenly collapsed to the ground and died. They were not breathing and their heart had stopped beating. The cause of death hasn’t been found either. Wang Lu was roughly the same. She was reading in the library when she suddenly fell to the ground. There wasn’t any warning. The people from the school and the military are investigating, but there hasn’t been an answer yet.”</p>
<p>With that said, fear appeared on Li Xuan’s face. “What’s more frightening is that they died at the same time. Furthermore…”</p>
<p>“Furthermore what?” Zhou Wen knew that Li Xuan had definitely discovered something important.</p>
<p>“Further, if I remember correctly, those people who died had touched that black tree. Coincidentally, when they touched the black tree, the black tree turned red.” Li Xuan swallowed his saliva and continued, “I don’t know if this has anything to do with their deaths, but it’s too much of a coincidence.”</p>
<p>“Did you tell the counselors about this?” Zhou Wen had an ominous feeling.</p>
<p>“I told them. The college has already sent people to Restriction City and found that bronze building. However, after entering, there was no sight of that black tree. There was nothing inside, not even a leaf. It’s as if there was never a tree there.” When Li Xuan said that, his body trembled slightly. Clearly, he was feeling a little horrified.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. Take me to their corpses,” Zhou Wen said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“The military has already taken over this matter and the corpses are in the military’s hands. I’m afraid it will be difficult for us to enter,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Take me there now.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he switched on the mysterious phone and opened the Dead Man Tree icon.</p>
<p>After he loaded the game, Zhou Wen immediately felt his heart turn cold when he saw the dead tree. He saw that the originally pitch-black dead tree was now completely red, like it was carved out of a ruby. It emitted a strange red glow.</p>
<p>The deaths of Wang Lu and company are indeed related to this Dead Man Tree. Now that the tree has turned red, Wang Lu and company have died. Then, if the tree becomes another color, will those students who share the same color after touching the tree also die? Zhou Wen’s ominous feeling intensified.</p>
<p>Now, all he wanted to do was quickly see their corpses and see how their deaths were related to the Dead Man Tree. He wanted to know if there was still a chance of them being revived.</p>
<p>An Jing overheard their conversation and subconsciously followed them.</p>
<p>Under Li Xuan’s lead, the trio quickly arrived at the school’s military base.</p>
<p>“Their corpses are inside, but it’s not just us; even if a counselor comes, they will definitely not be able to enter without the military’s permission,” Li Xuan said as he pointed at the door manned by guards.</p>
<h3 id='chapter166'>Chapter 166 Dissection</h3>
<p>“An Jing, can you take us in?” Zhou Wen cast his gaze at An Jing. At that moment, he couldn’t be bothered about their differences anymore.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was afraid that the military would dissect their corpses, spelling doom to everything</p>
<p>“Sure, but I have one condition,” An Jing said after some thought.</p>
<p>“I promise to fight you. Take me in immediately,” Zhou Wen said straight away.</p>
<p>“I didn’t say I wanted to fight you,” An Jing said, surprising Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Then what do you want?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“I haven’t thought about it yet. Just treat it as if you owe me one. I’ll tell you after I’ve thought it through.” After An Jing said that, she didn’t wait for Zhou Wen to rush her as she walked straight to the door.</p>
<p>“Hello, please show some identification.” The two soldiers who were guarding the door clearly recognized An Jing. However, after saluting her, they still kept her outside and did not let her in immediately.</p>
<p>An Jing seemed to have known this would happen, so she didn’t react in any special manner. She took out an identification card from her pocket before the soldiers allowed her to take Zhou Wen and Li Xuan into the encampment.</p>
<p>After asking where the morgue was, they went straight to it. She was no stranger to the military encampment here.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat glad that An Jing was here. Otherwise, with the encampment so huge, it wouldn’t be easy for him and Li Xuan to come in and find the morgue.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at his phone as he walked, only to see five flower buds appear on the glowing red Dead Man Tree.</p>
<p>The flower buds also looked like they were carved out of ruby. It was even more dazzling, but they exuded an evil aura. Through the ruby-like flower petals, he could vaguely see something inside, as if it were a beating heart.</p>
<p>“How many dead classmates are there?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Five.” Li Xuan thought for a moment before replying.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was almost certain that Wang Lu and company’s deaths had something to do with the five flowers on the Dead Man Tree. However, he didn’t know what the five flowers meant, nor did he know what to do. He could only wait until he saw the corpses before deciding:</p>
<p>In the morgue, Deputy Inspector Qin Wufu and a few Epic experts stationed at Sunset College were listening to the forensics report.</p>
<p>“There are no obvious wounds or symptoms on the outside. We didn’t find anything through X-ray either. We can only perform an autopsy now before we decide the outcome,” said Coroner Yan Zhen.</p>
<p>“No, we can’t dissect them.” An Epic expert immediately rejected Yan Zhen’s words with a firm tone.</p>
<p>“If we don’t do an autopsy, it will be difficult to find the true reason for the deaths,” Yan Zhen said slowly.</p>
<p>“The daughter of the Wang family died here for no reason. If we were to dissect her body, how are we going to explain it to the Wang family when they arrive?” the Epic expert from before said.</p>
<p>“Since Wang Lu’s corpse cannot be dissected, we can first dissect the corpses of the other four,” said Yan Zhen.</p>
<p>“That would work.” the Epic expert’s tone softened significantly.</p>
<p>“You can’t dissect them.” However, Qin Wufu vetoed Yan Zhen’s suggestion.</p>
<p>“Why can’t we dissect them?” Yan Zhen asked as he looked at Qin Wufu.</p>
<p>“Although their bodily functions have stopped, they still have a tiny bit of life on them. They might not be truly dead yet. You can’t dissect them and kill them!” Qin Wufu said.</p>
<p>Yan Zhen laughed after hearing that. “Deputy Inspector, if we don’t dissect them now, we won’t be able to find the reason why they are in such a state. Then, what’s the difference between them and the dead? Now, all we need to do is dissect the other four students, and we might be able to find out the reason. Who knows, we might be able to save Wang Lu. This is the best choice we have right now, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>A few Epic officers also felt that this was a pretty viable plan. If Wang Lu could be saved, their problems would be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>“If Wang Lu can be saved, the others should be saved as well,” Qin Wufu said as he stared at Yan Zhen.</p>
<p>“Please forgive me for my inadequacies,” Yan Zhen said.</p>
<p>“All of you may leave. I’ll chat with Dr. Yan alone.” Qin Wufu waved his hand and dismissed everyone. They left the morgue, leaving only Yan Zhen and Qin Wufu behind.</p>
<p>At this moment, Qin Wufu stared at Yan Zhen and said coldly, “Yan Zhen, I know that you can save them. You want to dissect them only because you want to know what kind of power has turned them into this.”</p>
<p>“Deputy Inspector, aren’t you thinking too highly of me? I’m just a doctor, not a god. I don’t even know what kind of injuries they have suffered, so how can I save them?” Yan Zhen nudged his glasses and said with an unperturbed expression.</p>
<p>“Speak. What condition do you want to save them?” Qin Wufu frowned.</p>
<p>“There’s no condition. Dissect four corpses and save one,” Yan Zhen said indifferently, licking his lips as he stared at the five corpses.</p>
<p>“They are living people, not your experimental subjects.” A furious expression appeared on Qin Wufu’s face.</p>
<p>“They’re real people if I save them. If not, they are just dead people. Using the dead as experimental subjects wasn’t even a big deal back in times of peace.” Yan Zhen’s tone sounded like he was saying something that was only right.</p>
<p>Qin Wufu was so angry that his face turned livid. If he didn’t know Yan Zhen well enough, he would probably have drawn his gun and killed this despicable fellow.</p>
<p>But now, he couldn’t do that. The only person who could save these five students was Yan Zhen.</p>
<p>Suppressing the anger in his heart, Qin Wufu said coldly, “Rescue these five students. I will apply for you to use the bodies of the dead soldiers for your experiments.”</p>
<p>“No, I want these four experimental subjects.” Yan Zhen categorically rejected Qin Wufu. There was no room for negotiation.</p>
<p>“Haven’t you always been wanting to experiment with the corpses of dead soldiers? If you miss this chance, you definitely won’t get another one. You’re giving that up just to dissect these four students. Is it worth it?” Qin Wufu looked at Yan Zhen and said.</p>
<p>“It’s worth it. These five people are in a very strange state. If I dissect them, it might be of great help to my research. I want to see what kind of power is at work,” said Yan Zhen.</p>
<p>“I will definitely not give you this opportunity,” said Qin Wufu angrily.</p>
<p>“You have no choice. If I don’t save them, Wang Lu will also die. Should I let Wang Lu die with the four of them, or let the four die while Wang Lu lives? Deputy Inspector Qin, make your choice.” Yan Zhen looked at Qin Wufu with certainty, as though he was certain that Qin Wufu could do nothing about him.</p>
<p>Qin Wufu stared intently at Yan Zhen, wishing that he could slay this bastard with his saber. However, he knew that it was useless even if he killed him. Yan Zhen definitely wouldn’t yield unless he achieved his goals. Killing him made no difference.</p>
<p>Furthermore, killing Yan Zhen meant Wang Lu was doomed.</p>
<p>Just as Qin Wufu was about to compromise, he suddenly heard the door to the morgue being pushed open. He could not help but be enraged as he shouted coldly, “Get out! Who let you in?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter167'>Chapter 167 Dead Man Flower</h3>
<p>“Uncle Qin.” An Jing looked at the furious Qin Wufu, a little puzzled who could make him so angry.</p>
<p>Although Qin Wufu’s name had the implications of being a warrior, he was not one that was prone to anger. The last time An Jing saw him angry was a childhood memory.</p>
<p>The reason Qin Wufu was angry was not that he couldn’t save those four students. If there was really no way to save them, Qin Wufu wouldn’t be angered or have his judgment affected even when an entire battalion was wiped out in war, much less the deaths of four students.</p>
<p>But now, there was a way to save them, but he could only watch helplessly as four students died. Furthermore, they died in the hands of a coroner on their side. This was something that Qin Wufu couldn’t accept.</p>
<p>“Little Jing, why are you here?” Qin Wufu’s expression softened when he saw An Jing.</p>
<p>“Uncle Qin, we would like to see the bodies of those five students.” An Jing explained the purpose of her visit.</p>
<p>Qin Wufu said, “What’s so nice about corpses? Little Jing, bring your classmates to my office first. Uncle Qin will catch up with you after I’m done here.”</p>
<p>“Inspector Qin, just like them, we had entered the bronze building in Restriction City. We have also touched a tree that can change color,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Qin Wufu said, “The military has already sent people to investigate the situation several times. There is indeed a bronze building in Restriction City, but there’s no sign of the tree all of you mentioned.”</p>
<p>“So many of us students saw that tree. So many of us can’t be wrong, right?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“I already know about this. I will send people to continue the investigation. There are still matters to be handled here. Go outside and wait.” Qin Wufu wanted to quickly convince Yan Zhen to save the five students.</p>
<p>“Inspector Qin, when the five of them touched that tree, the tree turned red, and now, they have died in a bizarre manner. There are more than a dozen students who touched the tree, causing it to turn into another color. Now that Wang Lu and the rest are dead, will the other students die one day? If we don’t figure out the problem regarding Wang Lu and the others, there might be even more students dying,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>When Yan Zhen heard this, he smiled and said, “This student is right. If we don’t figure out the cause of their deaths now, more people will die. My dissection of them now is to prevent more students from dying. It’s best you quickly decide.”</p>
<p>“You can’t dissect them,” Zhou Wen said before Qin Wufu could answer.</p>
<p>After seeing Wang Lu and company’s corpses, he was even more certain that they hadn’t really died. After approaching their corpses, the five flower buds in-game became even more dazzling, with signs of blooming.</p>
<p>Qin Wufu, Yan Zhen, and even An Jing and Li Xuan looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement, unsure why he was so agitated.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that he had to take the risk. It was impossible for Qin Wufu to hear a student like him shoot his mouth. Furthermore, Zhou Wen himself didn’t know what was happening, so how could he convince Qin Wufu?</p>
<p>Therefore, he could only take a gamble. If one of them could be revived, then Qin Wufu would naturally disagree with the dissection of the corpses.</p>
<p>“I don’t think they’re dead yet. They shouldn’t be dissected,” Zhou Wen said as he pointed at the corpses of Wang Lu and company.</p>
<p>Qin Wufu was slightly taken aback as he couldn’t help but carefully size up Zhou Wen. He had been engaged in battle all his life, so he was accustomed to seeing dead people. Furthermore, with the cultivation of his Primordial Energy Art, he could sense that Wang Lu and company were not truly dead.</p>
<p>A student like Zhou Wen was at most at the Legendary stage, but he could tell that Wang Lu and the others were still alive. This left him astonished.</p>
<p>“What’s your name? Why do you say that they aren’t dead yet?” Qin Wufu asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t answer the first question and directly said, “I’ve seen that tree with them before. Furthermore, I am more sensitive than most people. I can sense that they have the aura of that tree and the aura of the tree represses their aura. That results in this phenomenon of a fake death. If the aura of that tree is removed, they might be able to come back to life.”</p>
<p>“Can you really sense their auras?” Qin Wufu sized up Zhou Wen from head to toe as he was secretly impressed with him.</p>
<p>From his point of view, the aura Zhou Wen mentioned was likely life-force. It was impossible to see or touch life-force. Only people who cultivated some special Primordial Energy Art or had such special abilities could sense it.</p>
<p>Although Qin Wufu didn’t know how true it was for Zhou Wen to be able to sense the existence of life-force, the current situation matched Wang Lu and company’s.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>“I’m already aware of the situation you mentioned. I’ll think of a way to save your classmates. You can return now.” Although Qin Wufu thought highly of Zhou Wen, he didn’t think too much of it. All he thought was that Zhou Wen had a keen sense.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that it was impossible to convince Qin Wufu with his empty words as a student. Furthermore, he lacked the plans needed to save Wang Lu and company.</p>
<p>As he turned to leave, Zhou Wen took out his cell phone to take a look. At the same time, he ordered the blood-colored avatar to slash at one of the flowers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was originally somewhat hesitant to sever the flower buds. After all, this was a risk. If he severed them and ended up harming them, it would be equivalent to him killing Wang Lu and company.</p>
<p>But now, the military clearly didn’t have any good solutions. There was a high chance that they were going to dissect the students. If they were to do so, death was certain. Therefore, Zhou Wen might as well give it a try. That way, there would at least be a chance of survival.</p>
<p>Through the blood-colored avatar’s perception, Zhou Wen tried his best to sense the five flower buds on the tree. He could vaguely sense that the aura within the five flowers seemed somewhat different. They corresponded to the five corpses on the bed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen roughly determined which flower bud belonged to Wang Lu before he got the blood-colored avatar to slash at another flower bud.</p>
<p>Most people would subconsciously prioritize protecting people who were closer to them. Those who could prioritize protecting strangers or treat them as equals were saints.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t a saint, so he chose an unfamiliar classmate as his first test subject.</p>
<p>The Astral Slash Blade slashed across the flower bud like a sharp blade. The flower bud and leaves shook a few times but failed to be lopped off.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart tightened. The Astral Slash Blade was already considered a relatively powerful offensive Primordial Energy Skill of his. But if the Astral Slash Blade couldn’t injure the flower bud, it was likely that his other Primordial Energy Skills would be ineffective.</p>
<p>Although the saber beam failed to cut off the flower bud, the corpse on the bed suddenly moved and sat up straight like a zombie having come back to life.</p>
<h3 id='chapter168'>Chapter 168 Slaying Flowers</h3>
<p>The few of them were shocked as they looked at the corpse. It was the corpse of a male student.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, the corpse fell back onto the bed without any movement.</p>
<p>Yan Zhen immediately went forward to do a checkup. Qin Wufu also walked to the bed and stared at the corpse, hoping that things would turn for the better. He was in no mood to bother with Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>The trio stopped in their tracks and watched the situation on the bed. Zhou Wen stood near the wall behind them and got the blood-colored avatar to summon Banana Fairy.</p>
<p>The Banana Fairy held the banana leaf and waved it at the flower bud on the tree. The Grand Yin Wind swept over, causing the leaves to shake violently. However, that was all. It failed to blow off the flower buds.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the corpse began to tremble again. It was an extremely harrowing sight.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw that he couldn’t even blow off the flower bud with the Grand Yin Wind, his expression warped. He knew that it would be very difficult for him to cut off the flower bud today.</p>
<p>Unwilling to watch Wang Lu and company die, Zhou Wen had no choice but to summon his pets and attack the flower bud one after another. It could be considered a last-ditch effort.</p>
<p>“How is this happening?” The boy’s corpse shook continuously. Yan Zhen had used several methods but failed to detect anything, nor could he stop the shaking.</p>
<p>Noticing that Yan Zhen seemed to be at a loss, Qin Wufu couldn’t help but frown.</p>
<p>Yan Zhen’s medical skills were not only excellent, and the Primordial Energy Art he cultivated had something to do with his Life Providence and Life Soul, so he had an ability that was just short of reviving the dead.</p>
<p>Now that he couldn’t do anything about it, things were clearly turning for the worse.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched his pets attack the flower bud one by one, but it was completely ineffective. Just as he was feeling disappointed, he saw Truth Listener’s figure flash. It arrived in front of the flower bud, grabbed it with its paw, and plucked it off. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be delighted.</p>
<p>The moment the flower bud was plucked, the boy, who had been trembling non-stop on the bed, suddenly sat up. His tightly shut eyes suddenly opened.</p>
<p>“What… what are you trying to do…” When the boy saw Yan Zhen about to stab him with a needle, he immediately shouted and jumped down from the bed.</p>
<p>“Yan Zhen, quickly stop.” Qin Wufu was overjoyed. At the same time, he stopped Yan Zhen and immediately subdued the boy. He quickly checked his body and discovered that other than being a little weak, the boy was no different from a normal, healthy person.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also observing the boy. Seeing that he was indeed fine, he got Truth Listener to pluck another flower bud from the tree.</p>
<p>The flower buds were easily removed by Truth Listener. This time, Zhou Wen felt a lot more relaxed. He immediately saw the game’s system notification: ‘Obtained an Unripe Dead Man Flower.’</p>
<p>As the flower bud was plucked off, another schoolmate was revived. This delighted Qin Wufu greatly.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was also overjoyed. He had also touched the dead tree and had always been very afraid that he would die just like them. Now that he saw them alive again, he immediately felt a weight lift off his chest.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen waited for a while and seeing that the student was fine, he got Truth Listener to pluck the other flower buds.</p>
<p>The flower buds were plucked off one after another. Similarly, the schoolmates revived. Wang Lu was the last to wake up as she looked around blankly, unsure of what had happened.</p>
<p>Everyone was overjoyed. Only Yan Zhen frowned as he sized up the five students as if he was filled with doubt.</p>
<p>Qin Wufu called out to the other medical personnel and asked them to give the five students a detailed examination. The results were normal, but their bodies were a little weak and were in need of nourishment.</p>
<p>Seeing that they were fine, Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief before leaving with Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Yan Zhen, it looks like you’re going to be disappointed this time.” Qin Wufu said to him in a good mood before leaving with An Jing.</p>
<p>However, Yan Zhen ignored Qin Wufu. He only looked at the test results of the five students and sank into deep thought.</p>
<p>How did this happen? Their bodies had completely stopped functioning, so why would they be able to revive without any external help? Yan Zhen carefully recalled the entire process.</p>
<p>The anomaly of the five corpses seemed to happen only after the three students arrived. Could it be related to the three students? Zhou Wen’s face flashed across Yan Zhen’s mind. Although there were three people, he had the deepest impression of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because Zhou Wen had said that Wang Lu and company were still alive or because of Yan Zhen’s intuition, he was increasingly convinced that the matter was related to Zhou Wen as he thought about it.</p>
<p>That’s interesting. Was this a subconscious act or did he do something? The corners of Yan Zhen’s mouth pulled up as though he had thought of something interesting.</p>
<p>Yan Zhen was more inclined to the latter as he thought to himself, They’d all come into contact with that tree. Could it be some situation that allows them to exert a mutual influence amongst themselves? It looks like there’s a need for further research.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen returned to his dorm, he took out the mysterious phone and looked at the five ruby-like flower buds in Truth Listener’s hand.</p>
<p>Dead Man Flower: Flower of a Condensed Soul, Unripe.</p>
<p>After some research, Zhou Wen realized that the five flowers could neither vanish nor be absorbed. They didn’t seem to be of any use.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it must have been plucked off before it matured. That’s why it turned into this. What would happen if the Dead Man Flower matured? Zhou Wen wasn’t at all sure.</p>
<p>Just as he was considering how to deal with the five flower buds, he saw Truth Listener gesturing, as though it had something to tell him. At the same time, Truth Listener’s conscience was sent over.</p>
<p>The thought was vague and Zhou Wen was unable to take in the information clearly, but he could roughly make out that Truth Listener wanted to eat the five flower buds.</p>
<p>Since there was no point in keeping them, Zhou Wen agreed.</p>
<p>Truth Listener was overjoyed as it opened its mouth and swallowed a flower.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly thought of something as he hurriedly stopped Truth Listener from continuing eating the flower buds. Then, he made a phone call to confirm that the five students were fine. Only then did he relax and let Truth Listener swallow the remaining flower buds.</p>
<p>Although Truth Listener’s tiny body had devoured five flower buds, it still looked as though it was yearning for more.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t relax as he kept paying attention to the Dead Man Tree’s situation. Only after midnight did the red Dead Man Tree gradually change its color. However, it didn’t turn back to black, but golden.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen remembered that the Dead Man Tree had turned golden when Li Xuan touched it. He hurriedly made a call to Li Xuan. The ringtone on the other end kept ringing, but no one picked up.</p>
<p>On the dead tree, another few sprouts grew out</p>
<h3 id='chapter169'>Chapter 169 Showdown</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen kept calling Li Xuan’s phone, but no one picked up his calls. As for the sprouts, they gradually grew in size, forming a bud.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate. He summoned Truth Listener and plucked the few sprouts. Then, he called Li Xuan and this time, it connected.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, why are you calling me in the middle of the night?” Li Xuan’s half-asleep voice came through the phone.</p>
<p>“I called you more than ten times. Why didn’t you answer?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“No way, right?” As Li Xuan spoke, he looked at his phone. Indeed, there were more than ten missed calls. He was immediately given a fright. “Strange, my phone is right beside my pillow. How can it be that I didn’t hear it?”</p>
<p>Cultivators had keen senses. No matter how soundly they slept, it was impossible for them not to be woken up by their cell phone’s loud ringing.</p>
<p>“Perhaps you’ve been working too hard recently. Get some sleep. I need some as well.” Zhou Wen was certain that Li Xuan had been in the same fake death state as Wang Lu.</p>
<p>Ignoring what Li Xuan would be thinking, Zhou Wen hung up the phone and looked at the mysterious phone. He saw that Truth Listener had devoured all the little flower buds, licking its lips as though it hadn’t had enough.</p>
<p>For the next few days, Zhou Wen didn’t game. He stared at the Dead Man Tree every day. As long as it changed its color and sprouted, Zhou Wen got Truth Listener to pluck the flower buds and eat them.</p>
<p>As such, there were no more bizarre deaths in the school. At most, it was rumored that someone had fainted, only to awaken quickly.</p>
<p>On the eighth day, the dead tree recovered its original black color. Only when there weren’t any other changes did Zhou Wen let out a long sigh.</p>
<p>However, on second thought, Zhou Wen found it a pity. Up to now, he still didn’t know what changes the flowers would undergo if they truly matured.</p>
<p>Now that this tree existed in a mobile game, no one can see it again, much less touch it again. I’m afraid there’s no chance to see the scene of the flower truly blooming. Zhou Wen felt a little regretful as he thought to himself, If only this tree can be taken out again. If anyone offends me in the future, I’ll plant it at their doorstep. Without knowing how powerful the Dead Man Tree is, they will die just from touching it. A death a touch, two touches two deaths, how quaint.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only mused over the idea. Since the Dead Man Tree had entered the game, it couldn’t be taken out again.</p>
<p>“Coach, are you free now?” Feng Qiuyan, who had not seen him in days, suddenly came to Zhou Wen’s dorm.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a headache when he saw him, but he couldn’t chase him away. All he could do was reply, “I’m going to be gaming the whole day. I’m not free.”</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan didn’t mind as he continued, “Coach, I have already gained some success in the way of calmness. I hope you can test the results of my recent cultivation.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wore a look of puzzlement. He didn’t remember when he had taught Feng Qiuyan how to calm his mind. Yet, this fellow had actually mastered it.</p>
<p>“How do I test it?” It wasn’t right for Zhou Wen to say that he had taught him nothing.</p>
<p>“I only know how to use a saber. Coach, please spar with me and see if there’s any room for improvement in my saber techniques. Consider it my third lesson,” said Feng Qiuyan as he transferred the 20,000 to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to say that he didn’t have time to spar with him, but seeing that he could collect 20,000, he swallowed the words he was about to say.</p>
<p>Simply sparring gained him twenty thousand. There was no reason to refuse.</p>
<p>He went to a sparring hall in the school with Feng Qiuyan. Feng Qiuyan took a practice rubber saber and said to Zhou Wen, “Coach, what weapon would you like?”</p>
<p>“I don’t need any weapons.” Zhou Wen had never practiced any weapon skills in the real world. Although he knew how to use swords and sabers, it was only limited to him slashing with brute force. There wasn’t anything technical about it, so he might as well not use them.</p>
<p>“Coach, on your guard.” Feng Qiuyan didn’t stand on ceremony as he slashed with his saber.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan’s saber appeared as heavy as a mountain. It was so fast that one could clearly see it, but not dodge it.</p>
<p>Even more terrifying was the biting cold saber aura that came with it. It instantly streaked across several meters and struck Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan’s saber was fast, but Zhou Wen wasn’t slow either. He suddenly darted to the side and dodged Feng Qiuyan’s saber aura. At the same time, he used Dragon Gate Fairy Skill to escape Feng Qiuyan’s sharp and powerful saber aura.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan’s attacks increased in speed with each strike he delivered. Zhou Wen pushed the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill to its limits, but he found it increasingly taxing. It was as though he was a tiny boat in a stormy sea that could sink at any moment</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried everything, but only barely stayed out of striking distance from Feng Qiuyan. If it was purely a competition of skills, Zhou Wen wouldn’t even have the chance to counterattack.</p>
<p>“Hold on.” Zhou Wen suddenly shouted to stop Feng Qiuyan from continuing his attack.</p>
<p>“Coach, what’s the matter?” Feng Qiuyan stopped and asked.</p>
<p>“You’ve slashed twenty-three times since the beginning. Even if each strike only consumes one Primordial Energy point, your Primordial Energy should have been depleted. How can you still use your saber aura?” Zhou Wen asked Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Feng Qiuyan’s saber aura was so strong that it was impossible for him to only consume a bit of it.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan said, “This is because I’ve raised my Primordial Energy Skill, Rainbow-Startling Saber Aura, to Rank 10. After advancing to Rank 10, the Primordial Energy consumption is greatly reduced. In addition, my Life Providence and Primordial Energy Art augments my saber technique. It will further reduce the expenditure and accelerate the recovery of my Primordial Energy. Under normal circumstances, I can continuously slash out twenty-seven times before being completely drained of my Primordial Energy.”</p>
<p>“Do all Primordial Energy Skills have such effects after reaching Rank 10?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“Regardless of which Primordial Energy Skill it is, there will be a qualitative leap when it reaches Rank 10. However, the effects might be different. Coach, don’t you know?” Feng Qiuyan looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement. He believed that Zhou Wen definitely knew about this.</p>
<p>“I’ve never practiced Rainbow-Startling Saber Aura, so I didn’t know of the effects when it reached Rank 10. I was just asking.” Zhou Wen thought of his Ashen Palm. Although it was only a Mortal-stage Primordial Energy Skill, it was abnormally powerful. It dealt quite a good deal of damage to Legendary creatures. Vigor Divine Fist, which was a Mortal stage skill, was already unsuited for him.</p>
<p>Astral Slash Blade and Astral Suction Palm don’t have any ranks, so I’m afraid they can’t be upgraded. Ashen Palm has already reached Rank 10, but it’s a Mortal stage Primordial Energy Skill after all. Its might can’t keep up with my current needs, so I’m not sure if there’s any possibility of raising it. Zhou Wen decided to use his Ashen Palm to battle Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>However, he soon discovered that Feng Qiuyan’s technique was much more skilled than his. Soon, Zhou Wen was at a disadvantage. All he could do was use Dragon Gate Fairy Skill to dodge, making it difficult for him to find a chance to counterattack.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan’s saber techniques were getting faster and more stable. Even without the aid of the saber auras, he still possessed extremely lethal force.</p>
<h3 id='chapter170'>Chapter 170 Epiphany In Battle</h3>
<p>Typically, someone at the Legendary stage had Speed that maxed out at 18. Now, the Speed of Feng Qiuyan’s saber techniques was probably at 28, much less 18. It was getting faster and faster.</p>
<p>If one’s Speed exceeded the user’s control limit, causing their reaction to not keep up, it would easily reveal flaws.</p>
<p>However, Feng Qiuyan’s saber technique was as steady as a mountain. No matter how fast his saber was, he could control it freely without any signs of losing control after increasing his Speed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had to admit that Feng Qiuyan was indeed very mighty. He was practically a genius born for sabers. If Zhou Wen hadn’t fought desperately in-game to exchange for plenty of combat experience, a Legendary student with similar attributes as Zhou Wen would easily have been slain by Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, combat techniques are equally important. Primordial Energy Skills also need to be upgraded to Rank 10. Zhou Wen had already discovered his inadequacies.</p>
<p>He had learned quite a number of Primordial Energy Skills, but he didn’t really have many useful ones. Astral Suction Palm and Astral Slash Blade were very useful, but they drained Primordial Energy exceedingly fast, depleting him almost instantly.</p>
<p>Ashen Palm at the Mortal stage was already somewhat unable to keep up with his pace. The Legendary Golden Palm was only at Rank</p>
<p>After some thought, other than Dragon Gate Fairy Skill, Zhou Wen didn’t seem to have any useful techniques.</p>
<p>At the very least, when facing an expert like Feng Qiuyan, ordinary Primordial Energy Skills were useless.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen decided not to counterattack. Instead, he switched his Primordial Energy Art, giving himself a Dao Body. He used it to rapidly recover his Primordial Energy, constantly using Dragon Gate Fairy Skill to deal with Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>Even so, Zhou Wen still found it harder and harder. Feng Qiuyan’s saber techniques seemed to be able to increase his saber’s speed without limit, and each strike was faster than the last, as though there was no limit.</p>
<p>There was no limit to his saber speed, but Zhou Wen’s movement only had one speed. He was gradually unable to dodge Feng Qiuyan’s saber.</p>
<p>A glint flashed in Feng Qiuyan’s eyes as though he had already noticed Zhou Wen at his limit. He remained unwavering as a mountain as he slashed out with both hands.</p>
<p>This strike seemed to split a mountain apart as it seemed indomitable. It moved as fast as thunder as it tore through the air, ignoring all its resistance. With a whine that sliced through the air, it slashed right in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s current speed, it was impossible for him to dodge the attack.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t show any signs of panic. His eyes were calm as the entire world seemed to slow down before him. He tapped his toes on the ground gently as his body rode the wind and retreated. He didn’t look as fast as before, but Feng Qiuyan’s saber aura remained three inches away from Zhou Wen’s clothes. No matter how he tried, he couldn’t get close.</p>
<p>The alacrity version of raising a weighted feather? Feng Qiuyan’s eyes were filled with excitement as he brandished the saber repeatedly with both hands. The saber aura was like a raging tidal wave as it swept towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a sense of calm. In the middle of the battle, he had also gained insight into the concept of raising a weighted feather for the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill, pushing it towards Rank 10.</p>
<p>Dragon Gate Fairy Skill at Rank 10 not only augmented Zhou Wen with greater Speed, but it also increased his ability to stay in midair. It also greatly reduced his Primordial Energy expenditure.</p>
<p>There were other miraculous aspects that couldn’t be explained in a few words.</p>
<p>Just speed alone was inadequate to match Feng Qiuyan. After all, the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill had its limits, but Feng Qiuyan’s saber speed seemed to lack any.</p>
<p>At the same realm of raising a weighted feather, Feng Qiuyan’s saber quickly caught up to Zhou Wen who was in midair.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to strike Zhou Wen, Feng Qiuyan was suddenly taken aback. This was because Zhou Wen’s figure suddenly became light. It was as though he was weightless. As he rapidly plummeted, it was as though he had opened a parachute, making his body feel like it was rising instead.</p>
<p>This change in speed made Feng Qiuyan show an error in judgment. The saber slashed the area beneath Zhou Wen’s feet, failing to touch him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen danced in the air like a fairy, but in the next second, his speed suddenly increased. He grabbed the moment Feng Qiuyan made the mistake, and like a bolt of lightning, struck Feng Qiuyan’s head.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan’s saber had lost its force, but his momentum continued propelling his body forward. He was already unable to dodge Zhou Wen’s strike.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan was decisive as he threw his saber and turned to his side to dodge Zhou Wen’s strike. At the same time, he turned around and brushed past him. With a flip of his hand, he grabbed the saber in midair and slashed it at Zhou Wen. Then, using the spin he generated that boosted his waist, he slashed at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>In midair, Zhou Wen’s figure once again became lightweight, causing Feng Qiuyan to make a mistake in his judgment once more. He struck the empty air again.</p>
<p>This time, Feng Qiuyan didn’t pursue him as he stared at Zhou Wen with a glint in his eyes. “As expected of Coach. That was the counter version of raising a weighted feather, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded. “Raising a weighted feather and raising a feather weight. By combining them, it’s similar to a technique that mixes truths and bluffs. It’s just a small trick.”</p>
<p>“It sounds easy, but it’s very difficult in practice. Coach, you’ve taught me something new again today. I know what to do next. Till next time.” Feng Qiuyan turned around and left without any hesitation.</p>
<p>This Feng Qiuyan sure is terrifying. If I hadn’t reached Rank 10 for the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill, I probably would have been defeated. Ignoring the special physiques and Primordial Energy Arts, Feng Qiuyan is much more terrifying than John. Zhou Wen was in a good mood. He had raised the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill to Rank 10, greatly strengthening his combat strength. Furthermore, he had found his weakness in today’s battle, giving him direction for improvement.</p>
<p>It’s important to increase my level, but my techniques and skills mustn’t fall behind. After all, no matter how powerful one is, it requires powerful skills to fully deliver one’s greatest strength. Zhou Wen pondered over what skills he should practice.</p>
<p>There were too many skills in the world. There were sabers, swords, staffs, spears, whips, axes, hooks, forks and all sorts of other weapons that had skills that matched them.</p>
<p>It was likewise with feet, fists, fingers, palms, and legs. All of them had different skills. A person’s time and energy were ultimately limited. Although Zhou Wen was talented and could master everything quickly, being adept at one type of skill was much easier to reach the sublime realm than training in everything.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen still needed to take time to raise the few Primordial Energy Skills that were more suitable for him at Rank 10. He also needed to spend time gaming to have more high-level crystals drop. He really didn’t have that much time to master them all.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen came up with a perfect plan that killed two birds with one stone. It would be a waste of time to train in weapons while raising the rank of his Primordial Energy Skills.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen decided to hone his palm skills before matching it with his Ashen Palm. With his Dao Body rapidly recovering his Primordial Energy, Zhou Wen felt that he could do both.</p>
<p>Since ordinary Primordial Energy Skills can be raised to Rank 10, why can’t I raise my Mortal stage Primordial Energy Skill to the Legendary stage? Zhou Wen made up his mind to practice Ashen Palm.</p>
<h3 id='chapter171'>Chapter 171 Old Dragon Cave</h3>
<p>Wang Fei had been seriously considering how to educate Zhou Wen over the past few days. In the end, her final consideration was that Zhou Wen didn’t need repeated practice. Instead, he needed a lamp to shine a path for him, allowing him to see far.</p>
<p>Hence, Wang Fei thought of someone, Counselor Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan was an old counselor at Sunset College. He was about to retire, and at present, he was only doing some research work and no longer had class duties.</p>
<p>However, he still had a few students by his side. They were all outstanding talents in the school. Although they were not as famous as Wei Ge, they were not inferior to Wei Ge in their field of expertise and were perhaps even stronger.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan was Wang Fei’s uncle; thus, she knew him very well. She knew that although his level wasn’t too high-average amongst those at the Epic stage—the results of his research were enough to rank him at the top of the League.</p>
<p>In certain domains, Wang Mingyuan’s theoretical knowledge was so strong that it could be said to be the best in the League.</p>
<p>If Wang Fei were to make the request, he would likely give Zhou Wen a chance. But now, she was afraid that Zhou Wen would be too proud and unwilling to learn from him.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan’s theoretical knowledge was indeed very impressive, but he wasn’t very strong. In terms of strength, Wang Mingyuan could only be considered as below average amongst the counselors at Sunset College.</p>
<p>A genius like Zhou Wen probably wouldn’t like such a teacher. Typical geniuses enjoyed having people who could talk the talk and walk the walk.</p>
<p>Wang Fei couldn’t think of any good solution, so she could only try to persuade him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was considering which counselor’s class he should attend to study palm skills when Wang Fei summoned him to her office.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, I would like to introduce you to a counselor to learn more. I’ll let you study with him for a month. Is there a problem with that?” Wang Fei thought of how she had to convince Zhou Wen later. She wanted to let him know that learning from Wang Mingyuan was a lot more promising than other powerful counselors.</p>
<p>“Does that counselor know palm skills?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Of course.” Wang Fei nodded. She didn’t know why Zhou Wen would ask such a question. However, Wang Mingyuan had indeed studied palm skills, albeit it wasn’t his main research focus.</p>
<p>Even if he had never researched palm skills, which Epic expert hadn’t practiced in one?</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll attend the class, ” Zhou Wen said with a nod.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s straightforward answer left Wang Fei in disbelief. She had thought of many solutions to save this gaming addict, but had failed. For him to agree so readily made her feel like she was dreaming.</p>
<p>“Ms. Wang, what’s the counselor’s name? How can I find him? When can I begin class?” Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to waste any time. He needed to quickly make use of every minute to grasp the knowledge related to palm skills. He wanted to choose a palm skill that was suitable for himself before practicing it with Ashen Palm.</p>
<p>“The counselor I was referring to is Wang Mingyuan. He no longer has any classes and is only doing some research. I recommend you to be his assistant and learn from him at the same time. You can just visit him.” Wang Fei sent a message to Zhou Wen using her phone. On it was Wang Mingyuan’s laboratory address.</p>
<p>After some hesitation, Wang Fei asked, “Do you need me to take you there?”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Ms. Wang. I’ll be fine.” After thanking Wang Fei, Zhou Wen went out in search of the address.</p>
<p>He originally believed that Wang Mingyuan’s laboratory was in one of the experimental buildings on campus, but he soon discovered that the lab was in a dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Old Dragon Cave! Zhou Wen wasn’t unfamiliar with this place. It was one of the caves in Dragon Gate Grotto. Wang Lu had previously been there, claiming that there were dragon roars and treasure glow inside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had never encountered a dragon’s roar or treasure glow before, but he had been to Cixiang Kiln to see the Dragon Gate Twenty Pieces.</p>
<p>Despite its name, Old Dragon Cave’s interior was mostly occupied with Buddha statues. Zhou Wen had already been here once, so he was familiar with the area. However, he didn’t venture deep the last time. After passing through one cave after another, he saw a stone cave that had a manually installed door.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knocked on the door and a young male student opened it. He had long hair and looked rather delicate.</p>
<p>“Jiang Yan?” Zhou Wen was slightly surprised. He actually knew this student. He was the student councilor who had recognized Death City.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, right? Counsellor Mingyuan mentioned that you were coming. However, he’s at Dragon’s Well to carry out some inspection work. He won’t be able to meet you for the time being, but you don’t have to worry. He has left some work for you.” Jiang Yan took Zhou Wen into the lab.</p>
<p>Although it was called a laboratory, it was actually just a cave that had a large door installed. There were some apparatus and machinery inside, and on the other side, there were also daily necessities. It looked extremely crude and hard to imagine.</p>
<p>“Hui Haifeng…” Zhou Wen saw two other students in the laboratory. One of them was Hui Haifeng.</p>
<p>When Hui Haifeng saw Zhou Wen, he said with a smile, “I never expected you to become Counselor Mingyuan’s disciple. Great, we can be considered true fellow disciples.”</p>
<p>“Actually, I just wanted to learn some palm skills,” Zhou Wen said as he scratched his nose.</p>
<p>“It’s alright, Teacher Mingyuan is understanding and reasonable. You can learn anything you want. He won’t force you to learn things you aren’t fond of, nor will he make you do things you aren’t happy about.” Hui Haifeng smiled and said, “But before that, you have to finish the job left behind by Counsellor Mingyuan. See that thing there? It’s the work Counsellor Mingyuan left you before he left.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked in the direction of Hui Haifeng’s finger and saw that in the corner of the cave, there was a hollow. It was pitch-black and deep like a well.</p>
<p>At the edge of the hollow, there was a chain that extended out. It was as thick as an arm and was pitch-black in color. It was made of some unknown metal.</p>
<p>“Your job is to pull that chain up and then you can rest,” Hui Haifeng said with a smile.</p>
<p>Although Hui Haifeng looked good when he smiled, his smile made Zhou Wen feel like he was up to no good.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan, who was elsewhere, didn’t say a word. He only handed a piece of paper to Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen saw that the note mentioned his arrival today and that work had been arranged for him. It was signed off by Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>Since it’s work left behind by Mr. Wang, I’ll just do it. Zhou Wen had no choice but to walk to the hollow and grab the chain.</p>
<p>The moment he placed his hands on it, they immediately retracted as if they had been electrocuted, causing Hui Haifeng to laugh out loud.</p>
<h3 id='chapter172'>Chapter 172 Dragon Fishing</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen found the chain bone-chilling. It was colder than holding an ice block, as though the frost would drill into his bones.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng laughed and said, “There’s no need to be afraid. The coldness in the chains can’t hurt your Legendary body.”</p>
<p>“Why is this chain so cold?” Zhou Wen once again held the chain, feeling as though he had reached his hand into liquid nitrogen.</p>
<p>Of course, this was only Zhou Wen’s feeling. He had never attempted to put his hand into the liquid nitrogen.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng said, “This hollow’s name is Dragon’s Well, but there’s no water underneath. Instead, there’s a very thick white fog. The white fog is extremely cold, and there are some places where the temperature is even lower than liquid nitrogen. This chain extends all the way into it and is affected by the white fog, causing it to turn extremely cold. If an ordinary person were to hold the chain, they would probably freeze their fingers in no time. However, with the body at the Legendary stage, the effects won’t be too severe.”</p>
<p>“What’s this chain for?” Zhou Wen asked as he pulled up the chain.</p>
<p>“Do you know how to fish?” Hui Haifeng asked without answering Zhou Wen’s question.</p>
<p>“I tried when I was young. It was just for fun, nothing serious,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“Then you have to study hard. This chain is used to fish something, it’s not fish, but a dragon,” Hui Haifeng said sternly.</p>
<p>“Dragon fishing?” Zhou Wen looked at Hui Haifeng in surprise, hoping that he could make things clear.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng explained, “This chain was created by Counselor Mingyuan in order to fish up the dragon in Dragon’s Well.”</p>
<p>“There’s a dragon down there? What kind of dragon is it?” Zhou Wen was even more intrigued.</p>
<p>In this era, any kind of mythical creature could appear. However, dragons were a legend after all. It was probably something that only those at the Mythical stage could see. The average person had no chance of encountering one.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. It’s something Counselor Mingyuan deduced. We have never seen it before, but this Dragon’s Well does emit a dragon’s roar rather frequently. Occasionally, we can see a strange light shining out from Dragon’s Well,” Hui Haifeng said.</p>
<p>At that moment, a languid voice suddenly interjected, “No one has ever heard the voice of a dragon before, so how do you know that it’s a dragon’s roar? I think that even if there’s anything down there, it’s just a type of dimensional creature. It has nothing to do with dragons spoken in myths.”</p>
<p>Apart from Zhou Wen, there were three students in the laboratory. The person who spoke was the third person other than Hui Haifeng and Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>He put his hands behind his head languidly and slumped back on a chair. His legs were casually placed on the table, in a desultory fashion.</p>
<p>“His name is Zhong Ziya, another student of Counsellor Wang,” Hui Haifeng briefly introduced him.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya leaned against the chair and casually greeted Zhou Wen. “Junior, you came at the right time. I’ve had to pull up that crappy chain in the past. Now that you’re here, I’m finally free. I have to thank you for that.”</p>
<p>“It’s only right.” Zhou Wen didn’t think much of it as he continued pulling the chain upwards. It was unknown how long the chain was, but Zhou Wen didn’t find its end despite pulling up more than ten meters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the areas he gripped turned colder as the chain was pulled up. It was something that Zhou Wen was unable to withstand despite his potent body. All he could do was circulate his Lotus Flower Buddha Body Primordial Energy Skill to protect his hands to withstand the terrifying cold.</p>
<p>“Junior, you can’t use any Primordial Energy Skills when you pull the chains. This is a rule set by Teacher,” Zhong Ziya said languidly. Among the three of them, he was the only one who called Wang Mingyuan “teacher” instead of the usual “counselor.”</p>
<p>“Is there such a rule?” Zhou Wen looked at Hui Haifeng and Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan sat by the side reading quietly, as if he hadn’t heard Zhou Wen’s words. He felt oblivious to whatever was happening, only focused on reading.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng, on the other hand, was using some equipment to train his body. As he trained, he said, “Counselor Mingyuan has indeed set this rule. We can’t do anything about it. Just bear with it for a while. Thankfully, the cold really won’t hurt you. It just makes you feel a little uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>“What a strange counselor.” Zhou Wen had no choice but to stop using his Lotus Flower Buddha Body. All he could do was rely on his flesh and blood to resist the coldness from the chain.</p>
<p>The more Zhou Wen pulled, the colder his hand became. His fingers were so numb that they couldn’t even bend. However, Zhou Wen didn’t seem to have any intention of stopping as he continued pulling the chain.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng, Jiang Yan, and Zhong Ziya looked at Zhou Wen either intentionally or unintentionally as though they were watching something interesting.</p>
<p>He kept pulling until all ten fingers turned numb from the cold. With a slip of his hand, the metal chain that he had pulled up by nearly a hundred meters slid down again.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng and company only watched. None of them said a word, nor did they have any intention of helping him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the falling chain and didn’t feel discouraged. He sat by the side and rested for a while. After the coldness in his hands dissipated and his fingers returned to normal, he got up to pull the chain again.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen did better than the last time. When he reached a little more than a hundred meters, he couldn’t stand the cold again, causing the chains to fall again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen waited for his hands to recover before picking up the chain again. This time, he pulled out more than a hundred and ten meters, but he ultimately failed to withstand the coldness on the chains, causing it to slide down once more.</p>
<p>After repeatedly pulling for seven to eight hours, Zhou Wen still failed to pull out the entire chain.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to continue pulling the chain, he saw someone crawl out of Dragon’s Well.</p>
<p>The man was wearing an arctic suit and had a helmet on his head. When he climbed up, he took off his helmet, revealing a mature man’s gentle face. He looked rather young and had long hair. A few strands of white hair made him look more mature and masculine. He looked like a superstar in movies.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally thought it was a senior, but ended up hearing Hui Haifeng say, “Counselor, you’re back?”</p>
<p>This is Wang Mingyuan? Zhou Wen looked at the man in front of him in surprise, momentarily unable to accept it.</p>
<p>He heard from Wang Fei that Wang Mingyuan was about to retire and thought that he was probably an old counselor with a head full of white hair. He never expected Wang Mingyuan to look like that.</p>
<p>“Are your hands alright?” Wang Mingyuan nodded at Hui Haifeng and company before naturally pulling Zhou Wen’s hands over. A warm energy flowed into Zhou Wen’s hands and instantly dispersed the coldness.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Counselor. I’m fine,” Zhou Wen hurriedly thanked him.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan released Zhou Wen’s hand and asked with a smile, “How many times did you pull the chain?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter173'>Chapter 173 Seven Distribution Palm</h3>
<p>“I didn’t count, probably dozens of times,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you think of other solutions after making so many failed attempts?” Wang Mingyuan asked Zhou Wen with interest.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to try pulling it up,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>When Wang Mingyuan heard this, he smiled and said, “You’re quite interesting. The three of you, tell him how you pulled the chain for the first time.”</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan’s words were obviously directed at Hui Haifeng and the rest.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng was the first to speak, “When I pulled the chains, I felt that the chain was too cold, so I sped up, pulling it all the way up before my hands froze.”</p>
<p>Seeing Wang Mingyuan’s gaze on him, Jiang Yan held the book in his hand and said, “I also felt that the chain’s bottom was too cold, so I slowed down my speed. Sometime after the chain leaves the frost, the temperature naturally gets higher. Slowly, I pulled the chain up.”</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya pursed his lips but didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan said, “Ziya doesn’t abide by the rules the most. When he couldn’t pull it up, he used a Primordial Energy Skill to pull the chain up.”</p>
<p>“Speaking of which, three of the five students who studied under me succeeded the first time when pulling the chain. Two of them failed to pull it up, but you are the first to fail despite making so many attempts.” Wang Mingyuan smiled at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Who was the other person who failed?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>“One of your seniors who has already graduated,” Wang Mingyuan said indifferently and didn’t mention it again. He continued, “The rules are for rookies to pull the chain up before they are allowed to rest.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen walked back to Dragon’s Well and grabbed the chain before pulling it up again.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t seem to learn from the lesson or use the experiences of his seniors. He continued pulling at the same pace as before, and eventually, he failed.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan only smiled and didn’t bother him anymore. He took off his arctic suit and changed into casual clothes. He then put on an apron and took out some vegetables to begin cooking.</p>
<p>Not long after, the dishes were ready. There wasn’t much variety and they were relatively light and plain. They were basically vegetarian dishes with the only non-vegan dish being hard-boiled eggs.</p>
<p>The few students gathered around the table to eat. Zhou Wen put down the chain and came over, ignoring the rules.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan didn’t say a word as he similarly handed a set of cutlery to Zhou Wen. Everyone was given a bowl of porridge and an egg.</p>
<p>After the meal, Zhou Wen continued to pull the chain. Wang Mingyuan, Hui Haifeng, and company did their own things. Apart from having the necessary exchanges, none of them spoke much.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had originally come here to study palm skills, but he ended up becoming the chain-puller. He ate and slept as usual, and only managed to pull up the nearly 200-meter-long chain at noon the next day.</p>
<p>When the end was pulled out, Zhou Wen was taken aback.</p>
<p>The end of the chain looked like a giant fish hook, but upon closer inspection, he realized that it wasn’t a fish hook, but in the shape of a ship anchor.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen had seen such a ship-shaped anchor twice. The first time was at the Xiyuan Crystal shop, and the second time was on Gu Dian’s pocket watch.</p>
<p>However, the anchor didn’t have a woman’s side profile, and the hook was polished sharp. It looked like it was used as a hook.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out to the side of the ship’s anchor and touched it. He couldn’t help but frown when he realized that it had signs of being polished.</p>
<p>“Dragons are very greedy creatures, especially when it comes to food.” As Wang Mingyuan spoke, he brought a bag of Companion Eggs over and used rope to secure them on the hook.</p>
<p>“Lower it. I hope there’ll be something next time,” Wang Mingyuan said as he looked at the bottomless Dragon’s Well.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen lowered the chain back down. After finishing all his work, he came in front of Wang Mingyuan and asked, “Counselor, is there anything else you need me to do?”</p>
<p>“In the future, you will be in charge of pulling the chain. Everything else will depend on your own interests. I heard from Little Fei that you want to learn palm skills?” Wang Mingyuan said gently.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>“Most cultivators nowadays train in weapons. Even if it’s physical training, there are many people who train their fists and legs. There are very few who train their palms and fingers. It’s mainly because fistand leg-related skills are easy to learn but difficult to master. On the other hand, palmand finger-related skills are difficult to learn but easily mastered. There’s no real difference between the two. It’s the same when you practice either to the extreme. However, most people like to start with the simple. That’s why fist- and leg-skills are popular these days. As for palm- and finger-skills, they are difficult to gain basic mastery, making them unpopular,” Wang Mingyuan said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“If I wanted to train in palm skills, how should I gain a basic mastery?” Although Zhou Wen knew Ashen Palm, it was only a method of using strength and not a technique. Now, what Zhou Wen wanted to learn was technique.</p>
<p>“That depends on the type of palm skill you wish to cultivate in. Fists are external, while palms are internal. Ordinary fist skills go from the outside to the inside, while palm skills are the opposite. In the past, there was an old saying: Rather endure ten punches than a palm strike. It means that the palm strikes directly injure the organs, causing more serious damage to the body. However, it’s very difficult to gain basic mastery of such palm skills that focus on the internal. It requires long periods of practice. If you only wish to practice palm techniques, I have a few good ones. Gaining basic mastery is relatively simple. There are my comments on it. You can follow your own ideas to practice in it,” Wang Mingyuan said as he handed a diary to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen opened it and saw that it was filled with the content of the palm techniques. Furthermore, it was all handwritten. There were many parts that had detailed notes. They were crystal clear at a glance.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan’s handwriting was beautiful and graceful, a truly rare one. Even though Zhou Wen wasn’t a calligraphic expert, he found it extremely beautiful, leaving him comfortable just from looking at it.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Counselor. I’ll take a look at these palm techniques first. I’ll seek your advice on the rest later.” Zhou Wen had come here for the palm techniques. To him, the diary was like a treasure he had obtained.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan didn’t say anything else as he continued his research.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stayed in the laboratory and had to pull the chain every day. Despite there being many Companion Eggs hanging on it when lowered, they were gone when he pulled them up. It was the same every time.</p>
<p>This left Zhou Wen somewhat curious. He wanted to use his cell phone to enter Dragon’s Well to probe, but he had recently been studying Wang Mingyuan’s palm techniques, so he didn’t deliberately enter the game.</p>
<p>There were a total of seven palm techniques recorded in the diary. Although the moves were different, they were mostly similar. However, Wang Mingyuan managed to note down some of their ingenuity.</p>
<p>Each palm technique was recorded and there were a total of seven moves. These seven moves were called Seven Distribution Palm by Wang Mingyuan. Each move was ingenious and had a completely different style.</p>
<h3 id='chapter174'>Chapter 174 Dragon’s Well</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that Wang Mingyuan as a counselor was rather interesting. When he had questions, Wang Mingyuan would answer every question he asked. Although he didn’t speak much, he explained in detail.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan wouldn’t take the initiative to teach Zhou Wen, Jiang Yan, and the others anything either. He would only explain when they asked.</p>
<p>Usually, he would do all sorts of research. Zhou Wen could understand some research projects, but he couldn’t figure out the meaning behind them.</p>
<p>For example, if Wang Mingyuan allowed Jiang Yan to record the entire life process of an ant’s day, Zhou Wen couldn’t work out the meaning behind it. It was an ordinary ant, not a dimensional creature. It wasn’t even considered a mutated creature from Earth.</p>
<p>What surprised Zhou Wen was that Jiang Yan actually stared at the artificial ant nest created by transparent materials for 24 hours without moving</p>
<p>Anyways, Zhou Wen found these people odd. Only Hui Haifeng looked a little more normal.</p>
<p>Although the Seven Distribution Palm had a few moves, it wasn’t easy to learn them. One had to first master the seven palm techniques and understand their essence, so as to better understand and master the seven moves.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was Zhou Wen after all. He trained with full focus, and in less than two days, he had learned the Seven Distribution Palm. All he lacked was proficiency and use in actual combat.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan didn’t manage them, so Zhong Ziya would sleep on the table every day after he was done with his work. No one would bother about him.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen pulled up the chain, he took out his mysterious phone and sat in a corner to open the Dragon Gate Grotto’s dungeon and chose Old Dragon Cave.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar quickly found Dragon’s Well which Wang Mingyuan and company had named. In the game, Dragon’s Well was an underground hole with no signs of artificial excavation or the chain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that the bottom of Dragon’s Well was deep and extremely cold. He summoned the silver wings and switched to the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra which strengthened his physique before descending Dragon’s Well.</p>
<p>Dragon’s Well’s mouth was only about a meter wide in diameter, and the lower he went, the wider it became. However, when he was about fifty meters down, he saw white fog everywhere, making it difficult to see clearly.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that the temperature in the white fog was strangely low. After Zhou Wen used the Lotus Flower Buddha Body, he still felt extremely cold when he came into contact with the white fog. The coldness drilled right into his bones and, shortly after using all his strength to descend amidst the white fog, the screen turned black as the blood-colored avatar froze to death.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen’s body was fine, he shared the same feelings as the blood-colored avatar. The feeling of freezing to death was extremely uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Even the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra and the Lotus Flower Buddha Body can’t withstand the white fog’s coldness. How low is the temperature? Zhou Wen was alarmed, but he wasn’t willing to give up.</p>
<p>After some thought, he revived the blood-colored avatar again. Zhou Wen switched the Primordial Energy Art to the Ancient Imperial Sutra before letting the blood-colored avatar descend into Dragon’s Well.</p>
<p>Every time Zhou Wen circulated the Ancient Imperial Sutra, he felt as though a ball of fire was burning in his body. He wanted to try and see if the heat of the Ancient Imperial Sutra could withstand the cold.</p>
<p>The moment he entered Dragon’s Well, Zhou Wen felt something was different. Back when he used the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, although his resistance had increased, he could still sense the cold.</p>
<p>Now that he was using the Ancient Imperial Sutra, he only felt warmth throughout his body, without any cold at all.</p>
<p>When the blood-colored avatar entered the white fog, Zhou Wen only felt a slight chill. Soon, the heat in his body dissipated the cold.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted. The Ancient Imperial Sutra had a miraculous effect resisting the cold. While enduring the terrifying cold, Zhou Wen continued descending. The temperature dropped with distance, and after two hundred meters, even the Ancient Imperial Sutra’s power appeared somewhat lacking. It left Zhou Wen feeling a chill, albeit a tiny bit. It wasn’t enough to truly harm the blood-colored avatar’s body.</p>
<p>How deep is this Dragon’s Well? Zhou Wen’s vision was blocked. Thankfully, the Truth Listener earring had given him a powerful sense of hearing, allowing him to use his sense of hearing to replace his sense of sight. He could see dozens of meters through the white fog, and if there were sufficiently large fluctuations in the distance, Zhou Wen could hear it from afar.</p>
<p>He still didn’t reach the bottom after descending another hundred odd meters. However, Dragon’s Well had already expanded to a gigantic underground space. Zhou Wen’s hearing was no longer good enough to reach the surrounding stone walls.</p>
<p>By the time he reached a distance of nearly 500 meters, he felt like he couldn’t hold on any longer. If he continued, he might just freeze to death like the first time.</p>
<p>I can’t go any further down. Zhou Wen hesitated for a moment before getting the blood-colored avatar to summon a Golden Warrior Companion Beast.</p>
<p>This was an ordinary Golden Warrior whose attributes were pretty good. Zhou Wen had originally planned on using it for fusion when he incubated it.</p>
<p>The Golden Warrior didn’t know how to fly. After being summoned, it immediately plummeted and disappeared into the white fog.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Golden Warrior’s falling through the white fog and creating sound and material flux, Zhou Wen was able to use Truth Listener’s hearing to see it and have an image form in his mind.</p>
<p>The Golden Warrior kept falling. The Golden Warrior with the Golden Body Life Providence was unable to resist the cold produced by the white fog. Frost grew on its jade-like skin as it rapidly spread throughout its body.</p>
<p>After falling a distance away, the Golden Warrior’s body was frozen into an ice sculpture, emitting creaking sounds. Before long, it exploded, splintering into broken ice blocks that plummeted further.</p>
<p>As the fragments fell, they became smaller and smaller. Almost at the point of losing “sight” of them, Zhou Wen heard a terrifying scene.</p>
<p>As the tiny ice fragments streaked across the white fog, Zhou Wen heard them land on something before a scene formed in his mind.</p>
<p>It was a creature that resembled a winding mountain range. On a huge stone pillar that resembled a mountain peak, there was an oval-shaped object, looking like an offering.</p>
<p>When the ripples produced by the ice fragments touched the oval object, it made Zhou Wen clearly understand what it was. The surface of the object wasn’t smooth, but rather, seemed to be wrapped by threads.</p>
<p>Is that a cocoon? The oval object in Ant City appeared in Zhou Wen’s mind. It looked very similar to the cocoon in both shape and size.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could think further, the terrifying creature that had been hit by the ice fragments suddenly opened its huge mouth and roared upwards.</p>
<p>It was an extremely strange sound that Zhou Wen found indescribable. It wasn’t like a beast’s roar, nor was it a bird’s screech. It was like a long hum from a musical instrument.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>When the sound wave reached him, the blood-colored avatar’s body immediately exploded and the game screen went black.</p>
<p>Is that thing down there really a dragon? Is the thing it’s protecting the same as the cocoon protected by the Golden Flying Ant? Zhou Wen was filled with puzzlement.</p>
<h3 id='chapter175'>Chapter 175 Dr. Soul</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen found it impossible to snatch the treasure from the terrifying dragon-like creature’s proverbial jaws.</p>
<p>With just a casual roar, the fellow instantly killed the blood-colored avatar despite the two to three hundred meters. This was probably a top existence among Epic creatures, or even a Mythical creature.</p>
<p>In contrast, Zhou Wen felt that the Golden Flying Ant was much easier to deal with.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I should think of a way to finish off the Golden Flying Ant and see what’s inside the cocoon. Zhou Wen was extremely curious.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was still lacking to date. Even if he continuously used the Grand Yin Wind, he was still no match for the Golden Flying Ant.</p>
<p>It’s a little difficult to kill the Golden Flying Ant. Is there any way to obtain the cocoon without killing it? The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he found it feasible.</p>
<p>Before that, I need to have sufficient Speed. The Dragon Gate Fairy Skill nimbleness is sufficient, but its thrust and absolute speed aren’t its strength. Zhou Wen frowned as he thought. He wondered what Primordial Energy Skill could make him faster.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, why are you frowning? Did you encounter some difficult problem?” Wang Mingyuan happened to walk over and asked when he saw Zhou Wen frowning in thought.</p>
<p>“Teacher,” Zhou Wen subconsciously called out. He found it easier to address him as “teacher” like Zhong Ziya, so he began following Zhong Ziya.</p>
<p>“What problem did you encounter? Why don’t you tell me?” Wang Mingyuan said with interest.</p>
<p>He didn’t seem to have the airs of a teacher, evident from how he often cooked for Zhou Wen, Jiang Yan, and the rest whenever he had nothing to do. If one didn’t know his identity as a counselor, one would completely treat him as an older brother next door.</p>
<p>“Teacher, I’ve learned the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill, but I feel that it isn’t fast enough. Are there any faster Primordial Energy Skills that imbue alacrity at the Legendary stage?” Zhou Wen asked Wang Mingyuan the question that happened to be on his mind.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan thought for a moment and said, “The Dragon Gate Fairy Skill is considered one of the best alacrity-type Primordial Energy Skills at the Legendary stage. There are even faster Primordial Energy Skills and our Sunset College does have such a Primordial Energy Skill, but it’s not easy to obtain it.”</p>
<p>“What’s that Primordial Energy Skill? Which zone has it?” Zhou Wen was delighted when he heard that.</p>
<p>“Outside Sunset City, there’s a strange dimensional creature known as the Sun Chasing Bird. It has a type of Primordial Energy Skill called Sun Chasing, allowing people to possess a speed faster than Dragon Gate Fairy Skill. In addition, the speed-up isn’t just twice as fast,” said Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was taken aback when he heard that. The reason Sunset College had that name was largely due to Sunset City. No human had ever been able to enter the dimensional zone known as Sunset City; it was even more terrifying than Tiger Cage Pass.</p>
<p>To hunt dimensional creatures there—ones that could fly and with unparalleled speed-type Primordial Energy Skills—was extremely difficult for humans.</p>
<p>Although Sun Chasing Birds were only at the Legendary stage, Zhou Wen believed that the difficulty of killing one wasn’t lower than killing a Golden Flying Ant. After all, it wasn’t an easy task to catch up to it in the sky.</p>
<p>There’s always a chance no matter what. I’ll visit the exterior of Sunset City to take a look. If I can download Sunset City as a game dungeon, it’s not like I have no chance of killing the Sun Chasing Birds. Zhou Wen applied for a leave of absence with Wang Mingyuan and planned on searching the area outside Sunset City for the tiny palm symbol</p>
<p>Since Wang Mingyuan didn’t restrict their freedom and it wasn’t the time to pull up the chain, he approved of Zhou Wen’s departure.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen left Old Dragon Cave and, while walking up the steps of Dragon Gate Grotto, he began wondering how he could obtain the cocoon if he couldn’t kill the Sun Chasing Birds.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen felt his heart palpitate as though something ominous was about to happen. It made his cold sweat flow down his back.</p>
<p>He was alarmed as he immediately observed the area ahead of him. He saw a man walking towards him on the same flight of stairs. He wasn’t ugly, but he looked a little cold.</p>
<p>“Yan Zhen?” Zhou Wen recognized the person as the unease and palpitations in his heart intensified.</p>
<p>When he first met Yan Zhen, he felt that this person was a little sinister.</p>
<p>“We finally meet again. I’ve been waiting so long for you,” Yan Zhen said as he walked over, staring at Zhou Wen. Clearly, he was here for him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned around in a bid to leave, but he was dumbfounded when he turned around. He saw a figure wearing a white coat standing not far behind him, nearly sticking to his back Yet, he hadn’t realized it.</p>
<p>The shadow looked like a human, but its feet didn’t touch the ground. Instead, it was floating above the stone steps.</p>
<p>“That’s my Life Soul. His name is Dr. Soul.” Yan Zhen’s voice came from behind.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression changed as he summoned his wings, hoping to combine it with his Godfiend Life Providence to fly up.</p>
<p>However, Dr. Soul’s left eye seemed to flash like a camera. The flash in his eye contained a strange red color. The moment he was illuminated by the red light. Zhou Wen’s body, which was about to soar into the sky, instantly froze. He was unable to move an inch.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt his muscles stiffen and he couldn’t move his body. He couldn’t even summon his Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Yan Zhen came in front of Zhou Wen and sized him up before saying with interest, “I’ve investigated all the students who entered Death City. Only three of them didn’t touch the black tree you mentioned, including you. But why did you say that you touched that tree? Why did you lie?”.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was trapped by some kind of power and couldn’t even speak.</p>
<p>Yan Zhen snapped his fingers as the red light in Dr. Soul’s eye flashed. Zhou Wen immediately felt his mouth regain its function, but the rest of his body remained motionless.</p>
<p>“You are only a coroner, not a policeman. What right do you have to treat me like this?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“It’s fine if you don’t wish to say it. I can speak for you. After you came to the morgue, Wang Lu and the other students came back from the dead. As for the other students who touched the black tree, they also experienced a temporary fainting spell, but quickly returned to normal. This is clearly very abnormal. Tell me, what did you do?” Yan Zhen asked as he stared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand what you’re getting at. Release me immediately or I’ll shout for help,” Zhou Wen said with a frown.</p>
<p>“It’s useless. Everyone’s brain waves or souls will be affected or controlled within a certain range by Dr. Soul’s powers. Unless permission is granted by me, no one can see us or hear our voices. Even if I were to kill you here, no one would have any reaction,” Yan Zhen said indifferently.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shouted out in disbelief a few times. Indeed, the cultivators that came and went in Dragon Gate Grotto nearby didn’t seem to hear a thing or see them.</p>
<p>“Answer my question, or let me dissect your body and find the answer myself.” Yan Zhen’s eyes were burning with zeal. He was like a lunatic as he held a small and exquisite scalpel in his hand that emitted a chilling cold light.</p>
<h3 id='chapter176'>Chapter 176 Madman</h3>
<p>“You are a coroner. Don’t you know that this is against the law?” Zhou Wen kept using all sorts of powers at his disposal in an attempt to break the force that restrained him physically.</p>
<p>However, it was completely useless. With Dr. Soul staring at him from behind, with its left eye flashing with a sanguine light, he felt as though his soul had been sealed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was unable to use his Primordial Energy Skills, nor was he able to circulate the Primordial Energy Arts or summon a Companion Beast. Even the Lost Immortal Sutra that automatically circulated seemed to freeze.</p>
<p>However, this didn’t throw Zhou Wen into despair. This was because, in such an extreme environment, there was a strange and familiar power growing within him.</p>
<p>“The law is created by Man. If I’m strong enough, then I can set the law. It’s not a problem,” Yan Zhen said calmly, but the fervor in his eyes grew stronger.</p>
<p>“But you aren’t strong enough to ignore the law. If you kill me, do you think you can escape punishment from the law?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“That’s why I get Dr. Soul to do it. Otherwise, a Legendary student like you wouldn’t need me to use my Life Soul.” Yan Zhen approached Zhou Wen and used his fingers to open his eyelids. As he leaned in to carefully study Zhou Wen’s eyes, he said, “Even if I dissected you here, no one would know that I was here, much less know that I dissected you here. Therefore, it’s best you answer my question obediently. What did you do? How did you affect the souls of those students?”</p>
<p>“I told you, I have no idea what you’re talking about. I could only sense the aura of the black tree on their bodies. I don’t know anything else, nor did I do anything,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. It’s fine if you don’t wish to tell me. All I need is a tiny surgery to know everything about you,” Yan Zhen said as he swished his scalpel above Zhou Wen’s head with the scalpel. He said indifferently, “I’ll cut open your skull and extract your brain to read the memories inside. This isn’t difficult for Dr. Soul.”</p>
<p>“Why are you doing this? What do you gain by doing it?” Zhou Wen asked through clenched teeth. He knew Yan Zhen wasn’t joking.</p>
<p>“What do I gain?” Yan Zhen said slowly. “All this time, science and medicine have never been able to resolve the question of the origins of life. The so-called explanations are full of loopholes. Life is not a machine, and human consciousness is not purely an intelligent program. How did their consciousness come about? What kind of relationship does it have with the body? Can consciousness exist independently away from the body? All these questions are very interesting.”</p>
<p>“Does that mean you can kill your own kind without a qualm just to figure out these questions?” Zhou Wen looked at Yan Zhen as though he was looking at a lunatic.</p>
<p>“Life is short, so it’s only a matter of time before one dies. But my research is eternal. If my research succeeds, I can extract the consciousness of humans, or perhaps should I say the soul. Then, all humans will be able to gain eternal life. When that happens, I will be the savior of humans, and all humans will be grateful to me for I will be the one who made them gain eternal life. In this period of time, sacrifices are inevitable for research purposes. It’s an undeniable outcome for human advancement.” Yan Zhen seemed to be talking about something very ordinary.</p>
<p>“You really are mad.” Zhou Wen was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“Mad? That’s right. This is an era of madness. Who in the past would believe that there are dimensional creatures in this world? Who would have imagined that there would be companion Beasts and magical powers? Who knows if true gods might exist in those dimensional zones? And what I’m doing now is to become a god of humanity, allowing human life to truly belong to themselves, without being controlled by any other power. Aging, ailment, death, and disability will all become history and no longer be a problem that troubles humanity.”</p>
<p>The more Yan Zhen spoke, the more excited he became. “If my research succeeds, all humans can let their souls leave their weak bodies and enter high-level bodies at will. For example, you can use a tank as your body. You can also use powerful dimensional creatures as your body. As long as you are willing, you can have everything, and not have a weak, regrettable body as we have now.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if he should call Yan Zhen a genius or a lunatic. All he knew was that he was truly crazy, and he wasn’t willing to become the necessary sacrifice he mentioned</p>
<p>“Perhaps what you said makes sense, but unfortunately, there’s nothing special about my body. I also have no idea about the matter you were talking about. Are you sure you want to dissect me?” Zhou Wen calmed down.</p>
<p>In his body, that familiar yet unfamiliar power was brewing, like an ancient beast hidden under the calm sea.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that the power was his Life Providence. It was the Sigh of the King that was produced by the combination of the Lost Immortal Sutra and his talent.</p>
<p>Ever since he advanced to the Legendary stage, Zhou Wen had been able to sense the existence of the Sigh of the King. It was like a part of his body, as though he had an additional body organ, an existence that resembled limbs.</p>
<p>But before this, Zhou Wen had no idea how to use the new organ in his body. He could sense its existence and knew that it possessed immense power, but he was unable to use it.</p>
<p>Only moments ago did Zhou Wen finally sense the Sigh of the King and how he could use it when his body was restrained by Dr. Soul.</p>
<p>Humans were peculiar animals. Most of the time, they would only use the organs they needed. Many organs that they didn’t need would degenerate due to prolonged periods of idleness, to the point of forgetting how to use them.</p>
<p>A typical human’s Life Providence was a passive ability. There was no need for one to take the initiative to use it, but Zhou Wen’s Sigh of the King was clearly different.</p>
<p>When he truly sensed that the Sigh of the King could be used by him, the force had already begun to spread within his body like an ancient beast occupying his body.</p>
<p>“Scientific research has many uncertain factors to begin with, so it’s inevitable to take a wrong path. After all, this is a study for becoming a god. No matter how many failures there are, they can be forgiven.” Yan Zhen’s expression turned colder. The scalpel in his left hand had already reached Zhou Wen’s forehead. His voice said without any emotion, “Don’t worry. I won’t let you suffer too much pain. I’ll start with your skull and expose your pineal gland. Then it will be your left brain, followed by your right. When your brain is completely dissected, Dr. Soul will be able to use his powers to read the information within…”</p>
<p>As Yan Zhen spoke, the scalpel’s blade shimmered with some crystalline light. Under his slender fingers, he was about to cut through Zhou Wen’s skull.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>At the instant, Yan Zhen’s fingers moved, the force which resembled an ancient beast within Zhou Wen’s body erupted.</p>
<h3 id='chapter177'>Chapter 177 Terrifying Life Providence</h3>
<p>The scalpel’s blade was already clinging to the skin on Zhou Wen’s head and was just about to cut in, but at that moment, Yan Zhen’s pupils constricted.</p>
<p>The scalpel’s light flickered, but it could no longer move an inch forward. It was as if it was being held by an invisible force. No matter how much strength Yan Zhen exerted, he couldn’t move an inch.</p>
<p>“You do have secrets on you!” Yan Zhen was delighted instead of being alarmed. His eyes burned with frenzy as terrifying power erupted from his body, transforming into streams of light that gathered onto the scalpel, causing the light on it to become even more terrifying, one that was as resplendent as the sun.</p>
<p>Behind Zhou Wen, Dr. Soul also released terrifying power simultaneously. He also held a surgical blade condensed from a beam of light and slashed it at the back of Zhou Wen’s head.</p>
<p>Even though Zhou Wen’s body didn’t move, Yan Zhen and Dr. Soul appeared to be grabbed by a huge, invisible hand. They suddenly lost their balance and floated in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Yan Zhen’s face was filled with shock as he struggled with all his might. The blood-red glow in</p>
<p>the eyes of Dr. Soul’s eyes kept flickering, but it was completely useless.</p>
<p>It was as if they were being controlled by an invisible hand, unable to move or make a sound. As the hand tightened, their bodies were being squeezed thinner and thinner.</p>
<p>Flesh deformed as bones warped and his eyes protruded out.</p>
<p>“No… Impossible… How can a student at the Legendary stage… have such great power…” Yan Zhen was overcome with fear. Despite using all his strength, he was unable to resist that terrifying power.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>With a violent roar, Yan Zhen and the Dr. Soul were crushed by that invisible force and ended up dying.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched as Yan Zhen was squashed, but he didn’t have it any better.</p>
<p>The awakening of the Sigh of the King’s brought unimaginable power. After Zhou Wen’s body recovered thanks to the force, his bones emitted a creaking sound as though they would snap at any moment. His flesh and organs were under immense pressure.</p>
<p>All the blood vessels in his body protruded, and many of the more fragile fine capillaries had ruptured. His organs felt like they had been crushed to smithereens.</p>
<p>It wasn’t only Yan Zhen who couldn’t move, even Zhou Wen was unable to move thanks to the terrifying force. It was as though he was carrying a mountain on his back.</p>
<p>Unlike Yan Zhen, Zhou Wen could see a shadow appear over his body. It was this figure that had squeezed Yan Zhen and Dr. Soul to their deaths.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t withstand the terrifying power from his body as he collapsed to the ground with one knee propping him up. Blood spewed out of his mouth as the power that descended on him became more terrifying. It exceeded the limits of what his body could withstand. His organs looked like they were about to split apart.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen believed that he would be the first person in history to be crushed by his Life Providence, the force receded like the tide and shrank back into his body.</p>
<p>He suddenly relaxed as the pressure abruptly vanished and he felt his vision go dark as he fell to the ground and fainted.</p>
<p>Wd</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen woke up, he realized that he was actually lying in Wang Mingyuan’s lab. He was sleeping on the only bed in the laboratory—Wang Mingyuan’s resting spot. The students usually slept on the floor.Read more chapter on vipnovel.com</p>
<p>He couldn’t see Wang Mingyuan, Hui Haifeng, or Zhong Ziya. Only Jiang Yan was reading quietly in front of the oil lamp.</p>
<p>“Why am I here?” Zhou Wen moved and felt his body ache terribly. He didn’t have any strength and his body was as soft as a newborn.</p>
<p>“It’s best you don’t move around. Your bones are fractured and your organs are damaged. Although Counselor has already used his Life Soul to heal your body, you still need to recuperate for a period of time. Otherwise, those injuries will easily relapse,” Jiang Yan said casually.</p>
<p>“How did I end up here?” Zhou Wen asked again in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, Yan Zhen had died on the spot and, being seriously injured, he had fallen unconscious by the side. Even if the police didn’t believe that he had really killed Yan Zhen, they would still have taken him back to investigate. Therefore, it only made sense if he was in the police station’s hospital right now.</p>
<p>“When Hui Haifeng went out to buy some stuff, he heard a scream. When he went over, he found you fainted on the ground with serious injuries, he immediately got Counselor over to treat your injuries and bring you back.” Jiang Yan put down the book in his hand and looked at Zhou Wen. “You suffered such serious injuries in Dragon Gate Grotto? Who injured you?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know who injured me. Was there anyone else nearby?” Zhou Wen was filled with puzzlement.</p>
<p>It was fine if Dr. Soul had been crushed. After all, it was only a pure energy body, so it didn’t leave any traces. Yan Zhen was a living person, and Zhou Wen had watched him explode. Blood had splattered everywhere, so it was impossible for him not to leave a trace.</p>
<p>However, Jiang Yan’s recount made it seem like no one had seen Yan Zhen’s corpse.</p>
<p>“There were many people, but they were just bystanders. We didn’t discover anyone who had injured you,” Jiang Yan replied with certainty.</p>
<p>With that said, Jiang Yan got up and walked to the side. He picked up a bowl and walked in front of Zhou Wen. “This is the medicine prepared by Counselor before he left. He told me to feed you when you woke up. Not one drop can be left behind. This is one of my missions today.”</p>
<p>With that said, Jiang Yan picked up a spoon and scooped a spoonful of medicine and moved it to Zhou Wen’s mouth.</p>
<p>“I’ll do it myself…” Zhou Wen struggled to sit up, but his body was aching so terribly that he felt limp and without any strength.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you just now that Counselor has just treated your injuries and your body needs to recover? Don’t move around or hinder me from completing my mission.” Jiang Yan said as he took the spoon to Zhou Wen’s mouth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that his body couldn’t muster any strength, so he could only open his mouth and drink the mouthful of medicine. He found it extremely bitter, and he had no idea what it tasted like.</p>
<p>“What medicine is this?” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown.</p>
<p>“Medicine personally created by Counselor. It should be useful,” Jiang Yan said indifferently.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan fed Zhou Wen spoonful by spoonful until the entire bowl of medicine was finished ten minutes later. The medicine was so bitter that it made Zhou Wen’s mouth and intestines turn bitter. He almost couldn’t sense any other flavor.</p>
<p>“Rest well, don’t move around. Counselor said that you can only get off the bed in two days. If you don’t want to be treated again, then lie down obediently,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was weak, he could still move his limbs, albeit lacking the strength for any strenuous activities.</p>
<p>When he pulled away the blanket to take a look, he realized that he was only wearing his underwear. He was shocked and was just about to ask Jiang Yan if he had seen his phone when he turned his head and saw that his clothes were neatly placed by the bed. There were two phones and some miscellaneous items on them. The bracelet was there too.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately heaved a sigh of relief as he reached out for the mysterious phone.</p>
<p>There was no problem with turning it on. Zhou Wen unlocked the phone and was instantly taken aback. The other apps on the cell phone’s home screen were normal, but there was an additional number, “1,” on the Dead Man Tree icon.</p>
<h3 id='chapter178'>Chapter 178 Demonized General With Three Skills</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen was puzzled as he clicked on the Dead Man Tree icon. Soon, the image of the Dead Man Tree appeared onscreen.</p>
<p>However, at that moment, the Dead Man Tree had already turned white. Between the white leaves, there was a white flower bud.</p>
<p>How did this happen? Zhou Wen was alarmed. He looked at it for quite some time but failed to notice anything. The flower bud was still young, so there was nothing special about it.</p>
<p>However, the bud’s appearance made Zhou Wen recall Yan Zhen’s corpse. Yan Zhen was indeed dead, but no one had discovered his corpse. Now that there was another flower bud on the dead tree, it was very difficult to not make any connections.</p>
<p>No way? Could it be that the Dead Man Tree in-game can suck dead people from reality? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown when he thought of this.</p>
<p>If the Dead Man Tree in-game still had an influence on reality, wouldn’t it be very dangerous for him to carry it with him all day?</p>
<p>No one knew how great the effects of the Dead Man Tree were. It would only spell greater trouble if the people around him ended up being affected by the dead tree.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen recalled his Life Providence and felt his head ache even more. He had never heard of anyone not being able to withstand their Life Providence’s power.</p>
<p>In theory, this was an impossible situation. This was because the Life Providence had been born out of Zhou Wen’s body. Therefore, its power couldn’t exceed Zhou Wen’s own limits; otherwise, it would be impossible for him to produce it. Yet, Zhou Wen’s Life Providence had exceeded his own limits.</p>
<p>It nearly crushed my body with just one use of my Life Providence. I’m probably the only person in history. Zhou Wen mocked himself.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that his Life Providence was abnormal. It was very likely related to the Lost Immortal Sutra. When he advanced to the Legendary stage, he had seen an illusion that vaguely looked like a woman. And the woman’s voice was similar to the devil-like whispers he heard when suffering sleep paralysis.</p>
<p>When he used Sigh of the King, Zhou Wen felt the shadow around him seem to resemble a woman.</p>
<p>However, he wasn’t sure because he had only seen a blurry shadow. Furthermore, he had only seen a portion of it. Without a mirror, he couldn’t see his entire body, so he naturally couldn’t see a complete shadow.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan fed him the medicine three times a day, making Zhou Wen grimace in pain, to the point of feeling like he had transformed into a bitter gourd. It was as if his flesh and blood were emitting a bitter taste.</p>
<p>Only in the evening did Wang Mingyuan and Zhong Ziya crawl out of Dragon’s Well. He had no idea what they were studying down below.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng left the laboratory for some matters and didn’t return that day. Wang Mingyuan checked Zhou Wen’s body again before saying, “Your injuries are no longer serious. You can get out of bed in two days, but you still can’t do any vigorous exercise. It will take at least half a month before you can begin practicing your palm techniques again.”</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s surprise, Wang Mingyuan didn’t ask him how he was injured. It made the excuse he had prepared useless.</p>
<p>As he couldn’t get out of bed, Zhou Wen could only play games on the bed. Thankfully, his injuries didn’t affect the blood-colored avatar, so it wasn’t a problem to grind in-game.</p>
<p>“I say, Zhou Wen, I really couldn’t tell. You look so quiet usually, but you were so ruthless when you fought.” Zhong Ziyuan placed Wang Mingyuan’s bowl of porridge on a chair beside Zhou Wen’s bed. He grinned as he continued, “Tell me, who beat you up? As your senior, I’ll avenge you.”</p>
<p>“I really don’t know who that person is. I was ambushed while walking. I fainted without seeing anyone.” Zhou Wen felt weak all over and it was difficult for him to even sit up. So all he could do was roll around and lay on the bed to eat the porridge.</p>
<p>“Alright, there’s no need to go through so much effort.” Zhong Ziya picked up the congee again and fed Zhou Wen with a spoon. “You’re really useless. You didn’t even manage to see who your enemy was. It’s embarrassing for us. Don’t tell others that you are Teacher’s disciple.”</p>
<p>Knowing Zhong Ziya’s personality, Zhou Wen knew he was only joking, so he didn’t take it to heart. Instead, he changed the topic. “I heard that Teacher has another disciple. What’s the senior’s name? How is he now?”</p>
<p>“That senior, well… his name is Liu Yun. You should have heard of his name, right? Like you, he entered Sunset College from Guide High School,” Zhong Ziya said with a strange expression.</p>
<p>“Senior Liu Yun?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had heard of this name. Before Zhou Wen, there had been a few geniuses produced by Guide High School. One of them was a student named Liu Yun. It was said that he had received similar treatment to Zhou Wen in the past. He was the pride of Guide High School, and he was also the top scholar in the city’s college entrance examination.</p>
<p>However, Liu Yun was a few classes higher than Zhou Wen. Back when Zhou Wen was in high school, Liu Yun had long graduated, so they never met.</p>
<p>He never expected Liu Yun to be Wang Mingyuan’s disciple. Unfortunately, Zhou Wen arrived too late and again, Liu Yun had graduated a year ago.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya didn’t seem willing to chat with Zhou Wen about Liu Yun. After feeding him, he yawned and returned to his bed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was rather bored lying there, so he could only continue gaming.</p>
<p>When he arrived at Tiger Cage Pass, he encountered a Paper Demonized General once again. He was no longer as excited when he saw Paper Demonized Generals. He had met many before, but none of them dropped a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that he would end up with nothing, but after he killed the Paper Demonized General, he saw a Companion Egg mixed with red and black colors drop.</p>
<p>He found it unbelievable that a Paper Demonized General Companion Egg dropped. After a momentary pause, he got the blood-colored avatar to pick it up.</p>
<p>The attributes of the Paper Demonized General were similar to the two Demonized Generals from before and they had identical Life Providences. However, the only difference in skills was Astral Suction Palm.</p>
<p>After taking a look at the compatibility between the Paper Demonized General and the Mutated Demonized General, he realized that the compatibility wasn’t as high as the previous two Demonized Generals. It was only about 54%, which was equivalent to a fifty-fifty chance.</p>
<p>The probability wasn’t high, so Zhou Wen hesitated for a moment before choosing the fusion.</p>
<p>He had plenty of opportunities to have a Mutated Demonized General drop in the future. Even if he failed this time, he would still have a chance.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s choice, the Companion Egg transformed into a flash of light and infused itself into the mutated Demonized General’s body. Then, the sparkling glow on the mutated Demonized General’s body filled the entire image of the cell phone.</p>
<p>‘Fusion successful. Obtained Mutated Demonized General.’</p>
<p>As the light dissipated, the Mutated Demonized General’s figure appeared onscreen. It had a red horse and red armor, with a red crown on its head. It held a strange blood-colored spear, but its body emitted a strange black aura.</p>
<p>Mutated Demonized General: Legendary</p>
<p>Legendary Life Providence: Malignant General</p>
<p>Strength: 19</p>
<p>Speed: 19</p>
<p>Constitution: 19</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 19</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Astral Slash Blade, Astral Fist, Astral Suction Palm, Demon Flame Spear, Demon Rider Summon</p>
<p>Having succeeded in fusing a Mutated Demonized General, the attributes were comparable to Rebellious Knight’s. Furthermore, it had five skills that exceeded the limit. Amongst Legendaries, it was considered the strongest existence other than the mythical pets.</p>
<p>The reason Zhou Wen hadn’t hatched the Rebellious Knight Companion Egg all this time was that he had some concerns.</p>
<h3 id='chapter179'>Chapter 179 Inauspicious Life Providence</h3>
<p>With an excellent-grade Companion Egg like Rebellious Knight, one would typically choose to hatch it unless they were already at the Epic stage and not have any need for a Legendary Companion Egg.</p>
<p>John had been running around with the Rebellious Knight Companion Egg without hatching it. This left Zhou Wen somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>Hence, after obtaining Rebellious Knight, Zhou Wen carefully studied all of its attributes, including his Life Providence.</p>
<p>Then, Zhou Wen realized the problem. Although Rebellious Knight’s Life Providence being Knight of Destiny didn’t seem to be a problem, the blurb introducing it was very intriguing.</p>
<p>Knight of Destiny: Knight favored by destiny, the eternal protagonist.</p>
<p>Despite being a Companion Beast, he had a Life Providence of a protagonist. This clearly wasn’t a good thing. At the very least, John definitely thought so. Otherwise, there was no reason for him not to hatch Rebellious Knight.</p>
<p>After connecting the Rebellious Knight’s history with the knights of the round table, Zhou Wen was even more certain about his guess. The reason John hatched Sacred Spear Knight and not Rebellious Knight was definitely because of the same misgivings Zhou Wen had.</p>
<p>That round table knight was once the strongest knight under King Arthur, and together with King Arthur, he had established a glorious era together.</p>
<p>But it was also because of him that the round table knights fell apart. King Arthur’s death also drew the curtains on a legend.</p>
<p>No matter how great the legends and novels described this knight, it couldn’t erase his betrayal and selfishness. Like the famous Lu Bu in the East District, they had ended an era because of a woman.</p>
<p>Although humans could contract with Rebellious Knight, and not be afraid of his betrayal, it was ultimately not a good thing to have such an ominous Companion Beast by his side.</p>
<p>The main problem lay in him and his Life Providence. If I can remove the useless and jinxed Knight of Destiny Life Providence, there shouldn’t be too much of a problem, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Although John couldn’t resolve the problem, it wasn’t a problem that Zhou Wen was helpless against.</p>
<p>The mysterious phone had the ability to fuse Companion Beasts. As long as Rebellious Knight fused with other Companion Beasts, he could resolve the Life Providence’s problem.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the best choice was to fuse him with the Mutated Demonized General. Both were Companion Beasts with mounts, so the chances of successfully fusing would be higher.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had previously seen the Mutated Demonized General’s compatibility with Rebellious Knight. It was only 23%. Even Zhou Wen didn’t dare to risk with such a low probability. There was almost no chance of success.</p>
<p>Now that the Mutated Demonized General had undergone another fusion, Zhou Wen once again looked at his compatibility with Rebellious Knight. His compatibility score was even lower—11%.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, once a pet fuses, the compatibility score will drastically decrease. After repeated fusions, the compatibility score will drop even further. Zhou Wen naturally didn’t choose to have Rebellious Knight fuse with Mutated Demonized General. Therefore, up to now, Zhou Wen still hadn’t hatched it.</p>
<p>While recuperating, he gamed and killed monsters. To Zhou Wen, it didn’t matter. When he was grinding the Three-Eyed Golden Warriors, he obtained a 19-valued Constitution Crystal, allowing his Constitution to advance to 19 points.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously heard from the Wu siblings that after gathering the three Primordial Energy Skills like the Astral Suction Palm, Astral Fist, and Astral Slash Blade, one would be able to destroy the arrow shot out from the gate.</p>
<p>However, the Mutated Demonized General already possessed three abilities and was still unable to dodge the might of the arrow. Therefore, Zhou Wen was skeptical about what he had heard previously.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen still went to Tiger Cage Pass every time, hoping to have the Astral Fist Primordial Energy Skill Crystal drop. Even if he countered that arrow, Astral Fist was still an extremely powerful Primordial Energy Skill.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>He had casually cleaved a soldier to death when a Companion Egg dropped. It left Zhou Wen alarmed.</p>
<p>However, that was only an ordinary Mortal-stage soldier. It was useless even if its Companion Egg dropped.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was surprised when he saw the system’s notification. The Mortal Companion Egg’s attributes were very ordinary, but it had a 97% compatibility with Rebellious Knight.</p>
<p>That can’t be, right? How can this Companion Egg have such a high affinity with Rebellious Knight? Zhou Wen carefully observed the soldier’s stats.</p>
<p>Saber Shield Soldier: Mortal stage.</p>
<p>Strength: 8</p>
<p>Speed: 6</p>
<p>Constitution: 7</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 3</p>
<p>Talent Skill: None</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>It was basically a useless Mortal Companion Beast with average stats. It didn’t even have a talent skill or a companion form. It could be said that it was trash at the Mortal stage.</p>
<p>However, such a trash Companion Beast had such a high affinity with Rebellious Knight. This left Zhou Wen very surprised.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen got the blood-colored avatar to hatch the Saber Shield Soldier. His attributes were identical to what he had seen before incubation-trash.</p>
<p>Then, Zhou Wen made an extremely bold decision. He used the Rebellious Knight’s Companion Egg as a supplement to fuse with the Saber Shield Soldier.</p>
<p>The main reason was that Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to make a pact with Rebellious Knight who had a problematic Life Providence, so it was useless keeping it. But since there was such a high success rate, he could try fusing it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have much hope in the first place, but after the pet’s fusion was completed, the attributes gave him a fright.</p>
<p>Saber Shield Knight: Legendary stage</p>
<p>Life Providence: Offense and Defense</p>
<p>Strength: 19</p>
<p>Speed: 19</p>
<p>Constitution: 19</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 19</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Cross Sword, Everlasting Shield, Holy Steed Summoning, Holy Steed Battle Aura</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>The current Saber Shield Knight was completely different from the previous Saber Shield Soldier. He was wearing iron armor and riding on a black horse with a saber in one hand and a shield in the other. He looked extremely majestic and mighty.</p>
<p>The crux of the matter was that he had inherited the four talent skills of Rebellious Knight. The abilities were not much weaker than Mutated Demonized General with three main skills.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was exhilarated. This fusion not only resolved the problem of the Life Providence, it also allowed him to possess yet another powerful Legendary warrior.</p>
<p>Now that I have Mutated Demonized General and Saber Shield Knight, I might be able to form a cavalry team in the future if I get a few more. Zhou Wen glanced at the compatibility score of Saber Shield Knight and Mutated Demonized General. It actually reached 49%.</p>
<p>After some hesitation, Zhou Wen gave up on the fusion, unwilling to take the risk.</p>
<p>During the few days of recuperation, Zhou Wen lived rather comfortably. But on the seventh day, the white flower on the Dead Man Tree completely bloomed, and its petals began withering.</p>
<p>After the flower wilted, a white fruit grew out which Zhou Wen could faintly see a blob of light within. It looked familiar, but also unfamiliar.</p>
<h3 id='chapter180'>Chapter 180 Fruit</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen was puzzled as he stared at the fruit for quite some time, but he failed to crack the puzzle.</p>
<p>With the passage of time, the fruit grew bigger and bigger. The originally crystalline shell also gradually became thicker and harder. It looked like an eggshell.</p>
<p>The fruit formed on the Dead Man Tree can’t be a Companion Egg, right? After two days, the more Zhou Wen looked at the fruit, the more it looked like a white Companion Egg. He had no idea how to describe his feelings.</p>
<p>If the Dead Man Tree can really produce a Companion Egg, then what’s the Companion Beast inside it? Yan Zhen? Or is it his Life Soul, Dr. Soul? Zhou Wen could only make such a guess.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know when the fruit would mature. All he could do was slowly watch its growth. He spent the rest of the time grinding as usual.</p>
<p>It was unknown how many times he had died at the hands of the Golden Flying Ant, but Zhou Wen failed to touch the white cocoon it was protecting. This left him somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I have to think of a way to obtain the Sun Chasing movement technique. With absolute speed, I should have a chance of circling around the Golden Flying Ant and touch that cocoon. Zhou Wen was already able to get off the bed, so he decided to make another trip to Sunset City to check on the situation outside.</p>
<p>Although Yan Zhen wasn’t part of the military, he was still a coroner. He had disappeared without a trace and had a deep relationship with the military. It was impossible that no one would investigate this matter.</p>
<p>“Your body hasn’t recovered yet. Any more injuries will be very troublesome. Let Ziya accompany you.” Wang Mingyuan instructed Zhong Ziya to accompany Zhou Wen to Sunset City.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya was originally unhappy, but because Zhou Wen was injured, he had no choice but to pull the chain. Now, he had to accompany Zhou Wen to Sunset City. This naturally displeased him greatly.</p>
<p>It was unknown what Wang Mingyuan had said to Zhong Ziya before he agreed to accompany Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t even consider hunting the Sun Chasing Bird the moment he saw it.</p>
<p>What Zhou Wen could see with his naked eye was a black dot that streaked across the sky. At that height and flying speed, it was impossible for him to catch up, even with the power of his Godfiend Life Providence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Sun Chasing Bird never landed. It was a dimensional creature that would forever fly in the sky.</p>
<p>This was the first time Zhou Wen had seen Sunset City. It was like an ancient city floating between a mirage and clouds. It seemed to be extremely close, but it also seemed impossible to touch.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya looked at Sunset City between the clouds and said, “Because it can only be seen when the glow of sunset appears, it’s why this city is named after the sunset. The ‘sunset’ in Sunset College also points to Sunset City. The additional meanings behind ‘sunset’ were added by future generations.”</p>
<p>“Has anyone entered Sunset City yet?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>“How do we get in?” Zhong Ziya curled his lips and said, “Did you see those Sun Chasing Birds? They have been chasing after Sunset City all their lives, never landing on the ground. However, none of them have been able to fly in. Who do you think will be able to enter Sunset City?”</p>
<p>“By the way, why do you want to kill a Sun Chasing Bird? The difficulty of killing one is probably even harder than killing the typical Epic creature because you might not be able to catch up to it,” Zhong Ziya added.</p>
<p>“I need a movement technique that’s faster than Dragon Gate Fairy Skill. That’s why I want to kill a Sun Chasing Bird,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, there’s no need for you to kill the Sun Chasing Bird. Do you know the Lotus Flower Cave in Dragon Gate Grotto? There’s an Epic dimensional creature known as the Fairy there. If you kill a Fairy, you might be able to have the Dragon Gate Flying Immortal Skill. It’s the upgraded version of the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill. It’s faster, more potent, and more agile. It’s much faster than the pure speed that Sun Chasing Skill provides,” Zhong Ziya said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen said with a bitter smile, “I do want to do so, but I’m no match for Fairies. I’m only capable of killing a Fairy Monkey.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was speaking the truth. Back when he went to the Lotus Flower Cave, he had encountered a Fairy and ended up being instantly killed. Although he was much stronger now, it wasn’t easy to kill a Fairy.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, Zhong Ziya immediately laughed. “Isn’t there a simple solution? As long as you are sincere enough, get Hui Haifeng and Jiang Yan. With the three of us helping you, there’s no need to worry about not being able to kill a Fairy.”</p>
<p>“It won’t be nice troubling everyone, right?” Zhou Wen asked hesitantly.</p>
<p>“There’s no trouble at all. I believe that those two fellows are bored staying in the lab all day. They’ll definitely be willing to accompany you to Lotus Flower Cave.” Zhong Ziya thought for a moment before saying, “But that Fairy is an Epic creature after all. We’ll have to plan before taking action. We’ll discuss it later when we get back.”</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya continued speaking, blatantly ignoring if Zhou Wen was really asking for his help. They then rode an electric scooter back to the lab.</p>
<p>After meeting Hui Haifeng and Jiang Yan, Zhong Ziya told them about helping Zhou Wen hunt a Fairy. Hui Haifeng and Jiang Yan agreed readily without any conditions.</p>
<p>“That’s settled then. I’ll first head to the Lotus Flower Cave to test the strength of Fairies. Once Zhou Wen recovers from his injuries, we’ll kill her together,” Zhong Ziya said as he left the lab, giving Zhou Wen no chance to stop him.</p>
<p>“Will it be dangerous for him to go?” Zhou Wen asked worriedly.</p>
<p>He was a person who didn’t like to owe others favors. If Zhong Ziya were to die in Lotus Flower Cave, Zhou Wen really didn’t know how he should repay the favor.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Hui Haifeng pursed his lips and said, “Don’t worry, even a more powerful Epic creature wouldn’t be able to kill that fellow, much less a Fairy. He will at most suffer a little pain.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled, unsure why Hui Haifeng was so certain.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan said, “Zhong Ziya is a tough cookie. He has nine lives like a cat. He won’t die.”</p>
<p>Seeing how confident they were, Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else, but he was still a little worried.</p>
<p>When it was night time, Zhong Ziya returned. His clothes were tattered and torn, and he looked like he had been through a fierce battle. However, there was no blood on his body at all. Beneath his tattered clothes was flawless skin.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya slept the moment he returned, without saying a word. This prevented Zhou Wen from asking him what had happened.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen woke up every morning, Zhong Ziya was nowhere to be seen. At night, he would see Zhong Ziya return in tattered clothes. This continued for several days until Zhong Ziya returned with his clothes intact on the fourth day.</p>
<p>“Alright. After Zhou Wen recovers from his injuries, we’ll go hunt a Fairy,” Zhong Ziya said languidly after returning instead of collapsing in bed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally thought they were just joking, but he never expected them to be that bold. In a few days, when Zhou Wen’s injuries were more or less healed, they actually dragged him to Lotus Flower Cave.</p>
<h3 id='chapter181'>Chapter 181 Fairy</h3>
<p>“Are you confident in killing a Fairy?” Zhou Wen followed behind the group as they walked towards Lotus Flower Cave.</p>
<p>“No,” Hui Haifeng answered.</p>
<p>Although Jiang Yan and Zhong Ziya didn’t answer, their faces implied that they weren’t confident either.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you taking too much of a risk when you don’t have the confidence in killing a Fairy?” Zhou Wen looked at the trio speechlessly.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng smiled and said, “If it’s something that can definitely be done, what’s the fun in doing so? It’s only interesting if you aren’t confident.”</p>
<p>“What theory is that?” Zhou Wen was rendered even more speechless. He didn’t agree that risking one’s life for fun was something interesting.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya pursed his lips and said, “Hui Haifeng might not be entirely right, but there’s nothing wrong with it. If it’s something others can do, why should we do it?”</p>
<p>“What about you?” Zhou Wen looked at Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>“Counselor got me to watch you all. Since all of you are going, I can only follow,” Jiang Yan said indifferently.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the trio and was momentarily at a loss for words. He increasingly felt that none of Wang Mingyuan’s students were normal.</p>
<p>He had originally found Hui Haifeng was rather normal, but from what he saw today, he was wrong. Apart from Zhou Wen, no one else was in any way normal.</p>
<p>Why would a gentle person like Teacher, teach such a bunch of strange and eccentric fellows? Zhou Wen originally wanted to say that he wasn’t going, but the trio had already gone far.</p>
<p>“Whatever.” Zhou Wen sighed and shook his head before following.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t completely lacking in confidence. He wasn’t a Fairy’s match in the past, but he was much stronger now. Although he wasn’t enough to fight an Epic Fairy, he still had some confidence in staying alive.</p>
<p>When he grinded in Lotus Flower Cave, he would occasionally encounter a Fairy. It wasn’t difficult for him to escape.</p>
<p>Soon, the four arrived at Lotus Flower Cave. Not long after they entered the cave, they met a Fairy Monkey.</p>
<p>Before Jiang Yan and Zhong Ziya could make a move, Hui Haifeng nudged Zhou Wen forward. “You’ve been recuperating for so long, let’s warm up your muscles first so that you won’t have a cramp when you encounter a Fairy.”</p>
<p>I’ll be the last one cramping between the two of us, Zhou Wen cursed inwardly, but he had no choice but to approach the Fairy Monkey.</p>
<p>He had lost count of the number of Fairy Monkeys he had killed in-game, but he knew every action of theirs. When he saw the Fairy Monkey flap its wings and fly down, its claws shimmering with a terrifying light, he unhurriedly took a huge step forward and leaped up, causing the Fairy Monkey to barely miss him.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen struck the back of the Fairy Monkey’s head with his palm. The Fairy Monkey didn’t even have the chance to scream as it fell from the sky. It convulsed twice without any sound.</p>
<p>“Beautiful!” Hui Haifeng couldn’t help but praise.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan was also slightly surprised, but Zhong Ziya pursed his lips and said, “Passable. All that training in palm techniques didn’t go to waste after all. You didn’t embarrass Teacher.”</p>
<p>They encountered several Fairy Monkeys in a row, but no one was willing to take action. Zhou Wen had no choice but to head up and hunt them, treating it as an opportunity to practice his Seven Distribution Palm.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya led the way, passing through more than ten caves when they suddenly saw a fairy-like creature rushing towards them with its clothes fluttering.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen recognized it at a glance. It was a Fairy-an Epic dimensional creature inside Lotus Flower Cave.</p>
<p>But upon careful inspection, Zhou Wen’s expression changed drastically. He had seen quite a number of Fairies, but they were all dressed in colorful clothes with ribbons wrapped around their bodies.</p>
<p>However, this Fairy was different. She was dressed in black and the ribbons fluttering in her body were pure white in color. She was very different from the Fairies that Zhou Wen had previously seen.</p>
<p>“Oh no, it’s a Mutated Fairy.” Zhong Ziya was also surprised, but he had no intention of retreating. He took out a gun and aimed it at the Fairy, shooting three consecutive shots.</p>
<p>The bullets instantly appeared in front of the Fairy, but she didn’t move at all. The pure white ribbons danced around her body as though they had a life of their own, repelling the three bullets.</p>
<p>The bullets made of Primordial Gold failed to deal any damage.</p>
<p>“Run!” Seeing that the three bullets were useless, Zhong Ziya immediately turned around and ran. His actions were swift and without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had just started when he saw Jiang Yan and Hui Haifeng running, each faster than the other. They had run virtually at the same moment with Zhong Ziya, and Zhou Wen was the slowest.</p>
<p>However, even Zhong Ziya, who was running right ahead, was unable to rush out of the cave. Just as he was about to enter the neighboring cave, he saw the surroundings suddenly turn pitch black. He could no longer see anything</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya leaped up in a bid to rush out of the cave in the darkness.</p>
<p>However, with that jump, he slammed into what appeared like a steel plate. With a loud bang, Zhong Ziya’s face was flattened from the impact. He fell back as his nose bled.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if Hui Haifeng and Jiang Yan could see, but he could see everything clearly with Truth Listener’s powers.</p>
<p>As for the Fairy in the air, a black sun suddenly appeared behind her. It emitted black light which enveloped the entire cave, forming a dark space.</p>
<p>Is that the Life Soul of a Fairy? Zhou Wen had also seen a few Fairies, but he had never seen them use their Life Souls. It was unknown if the typical Fairy’s Life Soul was the same as a Mutated Fairy’s.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was just about to warn Jiang Yan and Hui Haifeng to be careful when the ribbon on the Mutated Fairy flew over like a jade wyrm tearing through the air. It was targeting Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to fight, he saw Jiang Yan’s figure flash and help him block. A slender sword had appeared in his hand in the process.</p>
<p>The sword’s width was at most one finger wide, even thinner than paper, so thin that it was almost transparent.</p>
<p>The sword in Jiang Yan’s hand drew out a purple beam and accurately hit the ribbon. It failed to slice through it but instead wrapped around the sword.</p>
<p>With a tug of the Fairy’s milky-white hand, the pure white ribbon tightened and the sword in Jiang Yan’s hand snapped loudly into several pieces.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan retreated in time, avoiding being sliced by the ribbon.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya leaped up from the ground, a gun in each hand. He fired ceaselessly at the Mutated Fairy, but unfortunately, all the bullets were blocked by the spinning ribbons. The Fairy wasn’t injured at all.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Why are we so unlucky? Zhou Wen knew that if he didn’t kill this Mutated Fairy, they would probably die. Without any hesitation, he took the opportunity to summon the Great Yin Fan while the Fairy was blocking the bullets. He leaped into the air and charged at the Mutated Fairy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hui Haifeng and Jiang Yan seemed to act as though their minds were connected by telepathy. They charged at the Mutated Fairy, clearly having the same thoughts.</p>
<h3 id='chapter182'>Chapter 182 Battling Fairy</h3>
<p>With a strong swish of the banana fan at the Mutated Fairy, the Grand Yin Wind swept out immediately.</p>
<p>The Mutated Fairy’s body fluttered like the wind, and the Grand Yin Wind seemed to aid her. However, a thin layer of frost appeared over her body. It was just that the cold wasn’t enough to freeze her. It merely affected her agility.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that this was because the Banana Fairy’s level was too low. If the Banana Fairy was also at the Epic stage, this single flap would probably have frozen the Mutated Fairy in midair. It would be useless even if she had the ability to ride the wind.</p>
<p>However, as the Mutated Fairy was flying with the wind’s momentum while suffering from diminished agility, it made her trajectory easier to predict. Jiang Yan held a semi-translucent whip that was neither gold nor jade. It looked like a weapon made out of a biological creature’s tendons. Lashing it out at the Mutated Fairy, the translucent whip wrapped around its ankle as though it had predicted her trajectory.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan pulled the whip with all his might, but the strength of the Mutated Fairy was so strong that it lifted him up.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan didn’t let go of the whip and continued to clasp onto it tightly. It was like a weight that greatly slowed down the Mutated Fairy’s speed.</p>
<p>The ribbons on the mutated Fairy’s body fluttered like a wyrm as they swept towards Jiang Yan. If he was caught by the ribbons, his body would probably be broken into several pieces.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng had already rushed in front of the Mutated Fairy. An arm wrapped in a metal bracer erupted like a volcano, emitting powerful streams of light as it blasted at the Mutated Fairy.</p>
<p>Due to the freezing and Jiang Yan, the Mutated Fairy’s movement was greatly affected. She could no longer dodge the punch, but she wasn’t flustered. She waved her hand gently, blocking Hui Haifeng’s punch.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng felt as if he had been struck by a hammer as his body flew backward. He slammed into the stone wall and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>
<p>Seeing that the ribbon was about to sweep him up, Jiang Yan held the whip with both hands and shook his body, avoiding the entanglement of the ribbons several times. However, that was all he managed. It didn’t stop the ribbons from eventually being on the cusp of wrapping around his body.</p>
<p>There was a sword flash hit the ribbon, a result of Zhong Ziya holding a sword at some point in time. It was unusually sharp and, although the sword beam shattered immediately upon contact with the ribbon and Zhong Ziya was sent flying, the change in the ribbon’s trajectory gave Jiang Yan a chance to dodge it.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan continued to hold on to the whip, dodging the ribbon twice before the threat of having the ribbon wrap around him happened again.</p>
<p>At this point, Zhou Wen noticed something. Jiang Yan’s whip seemed to have some special use which was why Jiang Yan refused to let go.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, he leaped up into the sky and once again flapped the banana fan at the Mutated Fairy. It blew the Mutated Fairy’s body to the side and changed her ribbon’s trajectory.</p>
<p>However, this time, the mutated Fairy seemed to be prepared. While she used the wind to escape, she tapped gently with her milky-white finger, sending a beam in the direction of Zhou Wen’s heart.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately felt his heart turn cold. The beam was too fast, one that he couldn’t dodge with his Speed. All he could do was summon the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior to put it in between him and the beam.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The white beam penetrated the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior’s Golden Body without stopping. Neither did its power dissipate as it continued forward, stabbing into Zhou Wen’s flesh.</p>
<p>Blood immediately spewed out from the wound on his shoulder. Thankfully, the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior was able to ward off most of its might. Furthermore, Zhou Wen had also used that opening to adjust his position without being hit in any vital spots.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng’s mouth was covered in blood as he delivered another punch at the Mutated Fairy. Then, Zhou Wen saw that he had once again been sent flying upon contact with her palm.</p>
<p>The diabolical longsword in Zhong Ziya’s hand flickered, but his eyes appeared even more diabolical than the sword’s glint. It presented a strange blood-red color as it slashed out blood-colored sword beams in a frenzy, sweeping right at the Mutated Fairy like a tornado.</p>
<p>The Mutated Fairy’s ribbons spun as they shattered all the sword beams. Despite fighting against four, she still held an absolute advantage.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t know if it was an illusion, but he felt that the Mutated Fairy’s speed had slowed down. It wasn’t as fast as before, especially her hands. They weren’t as light and elegant as before, as though there was something heavy on them that prevented her from moving them as she wanted.</p>
<p>It’s a result of Hui Haifeng’s punches? Zhou Wen saw a strange mark appear on the Mutated Fairy’s palm. He immediately thought of the two punches Hui Haifeng had delivered.</p>
<p>Without time to think deeper, Zhou Wen stirred up the Grand Yin Wind once again. This time, it wasn’t directed at the Mutated Fairy, but rather, it was aimed at her ribbon. He was forcibly changing the trajectory of the ribbon that was targeting Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>Even so, Jiang Yan’s face was still sliced by a ribbon. His cheekbones tore open and a trickle of blood immediately flowed out.</p>
<p>Following that, another beam of light shot towards Jiang Yan’s head. He had no room to dodge unless he was willing to release the whip in his hand.</p>
<p>“Hold her back.” Jiang Yan grabbed the whip and screamed.</p>
<p>“How? I can’t even if I were to throw my life at her.” Zhong Ziya held his sword with both hands as he unleashed several sword beams at the light beams that the Mutated Fairy produced</p>
<p>When the diabolical blood-colored sword beams came into contact with the beams, they immediately burst like blood-colored fireworks.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya was also sent flying by the force of the blow. His hands holding the sword were covered in blood, but the beam still shot towards Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>Just as the beam was about to shoot through Jiang Yan’s head, an invisible force suddenly pulled his body to the side, allowing him to barely dodge the attack.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had yanked Jiang Yan with his Astral Suction Palm, saving his life in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>Despite the four of them engaging the Mutated Fairy in combat, he was covered in injuries. This was the first time Zhou Wen had risked his life so crazily. In the past, he had only been gaming. Although he shared the same feelings in-game, it was a game after all. Zhou Wen knew that he couldn’t die; therefore, the feeling now was completely different.</p>
<p>Under the true threat of death, Zhou Wen felt his entire being in a state of nervousness and oppression.</p>
<p>In such a state, a normal person’s body would become uneasy and cause their actions to change. Perhaps one wouldn’t even be able to perform at seventy to eighty percent of their original strength.</p>
<p>However, the more pressure Zhou Wen felt, the faster his body and mind were.</p>
<p>The ribbons sliced past his muscles, producing a sound of lacerating flesh and bones that left him trembling. The horror pressured him, but it made his body even more excited.</p>
<p>As he licked the blood from his mouth, he saw the Fairy’s hands hang down. Having just exerted her strength, she could only rely on the ribbons to protect her. Zhou Wen flew in the air like a bat, narrowly passing through the gaps between the ribbons. He swept over the Fairy and simultaneously struck the top of her head.</p>
<p>This palm was formless and silent, but when it struck the top of the Fairy’s head, it caused her to scream in pain. Subconsciously, it shot ten beams at Zhou Wen with her fingers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen switched his Primordial Energy Art to Godfiend Era and using the Life Providence’s ability to levitate, he pushed the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill to its limits. Twisting his body, he dodged the terrifying beams.</p>
<h3 id='chapter183'>Chapter 183 Stat Requirements</h3>
<p>It wasn’t solely because of Zhou Wen’s speed and agility that he managed to dodge the beams. It had to do with the Mutated Fairy’s fingers drastically slowing down. The mark that Hui Haifeng’s strike left on her hand continued to do its magic, slowing down her hands with time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen didn’t know if he was mistaken, but he felt that the Mutated Fairy’s strength had weakened significantly. The intensity of the beam had clearly decreased.</p>
<p>By the time the Mutated Fairy attacked Zhou Wen, she was in a panic. Hui Haifeng took the opportunity to leap up and strike her back, bombarding her with his two fists. This produced about four marks on her back.</p>
<p>The Mutated Fairy turned around in an attempt to kill him, but her body suddenly stopped in midair. Jiang Yan had already landed on the ground at some point in time. He held onto the long whip with both hands and forcefully pulled back the Mutated Fairy’s body, preventing her from continuing her flight.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw Jiang Yan’s body sparkling with purple light like a demonic spirit. The whip was also glowing with purple light, as though it was a blood-sucking demon that was constantly trembling and swallowing.</p>
<p>“Die!” Zhong Ziya repeatedly slashed with his sword, both hands gripped tightly on it. Streaks of blood-red sword beams slashed at the Mutated Fairy that Jiang Yan had put to a halt. They actually split apart her robe, leaving behind streaks of blood.</p>
<p>Although the sword marks weren’t deep, it was the first time Zhou Wen and company had truly injured the Mutated Fairy.</p>
<p>The Mutated Fairy was clearly a spent force. Her movements became slower and slower, as though she had a mountain suppressing her. Furthermore, her strength was weakening, and Jiang Yan was becoming stronger.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Like a demon god, Jiang Yan pulled the whip in his hand, forcefully throwing the mutated Fairy’s figure out and slamming her into the stone wall. This left a huge hole in the wall as the Mutated Fairy’s mouth was covered in blood.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya slashed down with his sword as well. The blood-red sword beam slashed at the head of the mutated Fairy, and the sword plunged into the skull.</p>
<p>A fierce glint flashed in the Mutated Fairy’s eyes as she abruptly stood up and hugged Zhong Ziya. A terrifying power erupted from her body.</p>
<p>“No good… She’s going to self-destruct…” Hui Haifeng shouted loudly.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya struggled with all his might, but he was unable to break free. Despite Jiang Yan yanking his long whip, he could only pull the Mutated Fairy and Zhong Ziya over. He couldn’t separate them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t far from Zhong Ziya as he was right behind him. A thought suddenly came to his mind as he charged at Zhong Ziya and struck him on the back.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used all his strength to slam his Ashen Palm at Zhong Ziya’s back.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya’s body was fine, but the Mutated Fairy in front of him seemed to suffer a heavy blow to her chest. Blood spurted out of her mouth as her embracing of Zhong Ziya weakened significantly.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya struggled with all his might, got out of her embrace, and kicked her hard.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>As she flew in the air, the Mutated Fairy’s body exploded. A terrifying black aura sent Zhou Wen, Zhong Ziya, Hui Haifeng, and Jiang Yan flying. Instantly, the entire cave trembled and the ground quaked. Dust rose up as gravel flew.</p>
<p>“Are all of you alright?” Hui Haifeng crawled out of the rubble, his body covered in blood and dust. He wore an ashen look as though he had just crawled out of a tomb.</p>
<p>“I’m fine.” Jiang Yan also stood up from his spot elsewhere. Apart from his body being a little dirty, he was fine.</p>
<p>“I’m not.” Zhong Ziya was slumped at the feet of a stone statue. His back was covered in bloody flesh, and his injuries were indeed serious.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s injuries weren’t light either, he was about as injured as Hui Haifeng.</p>
<p>“Not being dead is good,” Jiang Yan said with a smile after checking Zhong Ziya’s injuries.</p>
<p>Clearly, Zhong Ziya’s life was not in danger, but his injuries were more serious.</p>
<p>“Is that how a person speaks?” Zhong Ziya said weakly, “Don’t talk so much. Hurry up and look around and see if anything dropped from the Mutated Fairy. If nothing dropped, our injuries will have been for nothing.”</p>
<p>Jiang Yan’s condition was the best. He rummaged through the rubble and soon, they heard him say happily, “There’s something. It’s a Primordial Energy Skill Crystal. I wonder if it’s the Flying Immortal Skill.”</p>
<p>“As long as there’s something. It doesn’t matter what it is,” Zhong Ziya said.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan threw a crystal at Zhou Wen. “I don’t know if it’s the Flying Immortal Skill. Go back and give it a try. However, be careful. Taking in an Epic Primordial Energy Skill at the Legendary stage is extremely dangerous. If you aren’t confident, it’s best you consult Counselor.”</p>
<p>“Give me your accounts. I’ll transfer your shares to you later,” Zhou Wen said without standing on ceremony as he grabbed the Primordial Energy Skill Crystal.</p>
<p>“There’s no need for money. You will be part of my team when I wish to kill some dimensional creature in the future,” Hui Haifeng said.</p>
<p>“Can we talk about money later? Can you take me back to Teacher to treat my injuries first?” Zhong Ziya groaned.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan carried Zhong Ziya on his back while Zhou Wen and Hui Haifeng helped each other out of Lotus Flower Cave. Soon, they returned to the laboratory in Old Dragon Cave.</p>
<p>When Wang Mingyuan saw the four of them, Zhou Wen and company were like old, weak soldiers who had just been defeated. They were all covered in dirt and blood.</p>
<p>However, Wang Mingyuan didn’t ask about their escapades. He only summoned his soul and used the power of his Life Soul to treat their wounds.</p>
<p>This was the first time Zhou Wen had seen Wang Mingyuan’s Life Soul. He had been unconscious back when Wang Mingyuan treated his wounds.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan’s Life Soul was a bottle with a thin neck. Although it wasn’t gorgeous, it had some beauty. A stream of light flowed out of the bottle like water and when it touched a wound, Zhou Wen immediately felt a refreshing feeling as the pain of the wound was alleviated.</p>
<p>As the aqueous light flowed into the wound, the wounds healed at a discernible pace. Even his bones recovered rapidly.</p>
<p>After treating the quartet’s injuries, Wang Mingyuan smiled and said to them, “It’s rare that the four of you were injured together. Let’s have a feast to celebrate tonight.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen recovered very quickly. Even without Wang Mingyuan’s treatment, as long as he switched to the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, his recuperation ability would be much better than the average person’s.</p>
<p>Hence, while Zhong Ziya and Hui Haifeng were still lying in the bed, Zhou Wen and Jiang Yan joined Wang Mingyuan for a celebratory feast.</p>
<p>While resting in the evening, Zhou Wen took out the Mutated Fairy’s crystal. It was about the size of a chicken egg. It was crystalline, and inside it was a Mutated Fairy’s shadow.</p>
<p>Using the phone’s camera function to check the crystal’s attributes, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be dumbfounded.</p>
<p>‘Mutated Fairy Crystal: Epic stage. Merging requires a Speed of more than 21 points and a Buddha-elemental Primordial Energy Art.’</p>
<p>This was the first time Zhou Wen had seen a Primordial Energy Skill that had a stat requirement other than Primordial Energy points. Furthermore, there were requirements on the Primordial Energy Art. This was something he had never learned in school.</p>
<h3 id='chapter184'>Chapter 184 Doctor Darkness</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen’s current Speed was only 18—quite a distance from 21 points, so the final three points were extremely difficult for him to raise. Apart from grinding monsters to have high-valued crystals drop, Zhou Wen didn’t have any other good methods.</p>
<p>I can only give it a try and see if I can use the mysterious phone to obtain the Skill Crystals in-game. Perhaps I can refine them and absorb them there. Zhou Wen hid under his blanket and used the mysterious phone’s camera function to try snapping a picture of the Mutated Fairy Crystal.</p>
<p>A system notification popped up on the phone: ‘Yet to reach the stat requirements for the skill crystal; thus, it cannot be refined and absorbed. Do you want to continue?’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly chose no. Since he couldn’t refine and absorb it, nor was there any way to store items in an inventory in-game, the crystal might end up being erased if the blood-colored avatar died after he brought it in-game. He might as well leave it in the real world.</p>
<p>I can’t refine and absorb it in-game if I can’t meet the stat requirements? Zhou Wen felt a little depressed.</p>
<p>It was nearly impossible for a 21-valued Speed Crystal to drop from a Legendary creature. Unless Zhou Wen killed an Epic creature, it was very difficult to get his hands on one.</p>
<p>The experience of killing the Fairy today made Zhou Wen fully realize how terrifying an Epic creature was. If any of the four of them had made a mistake today, they might have perished there and then.</p>
<p>And the combat power of Fairy was considered lowly among the Epic creatures.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s strength alone, it would probably be difficult for him to succeed even with the help of a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>As for the Buddha-elemental Primordial Energy Art requirement, it wasn’t difficult for Zhou Wen. All he needed to do was switch his Primordial Energy Art to the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, and he was likely to satisfy the condition.</p>
<p>He took a look at his blood-colored avatar’s unchanged stats again. Only Ashen Palm had changed from the Mortal stage to the Legendary stage. Furthermore, it was still at Rank 10.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t find it strange that his Ashen Palm had advanced from the Mortal stage to the Legendary stage. He had already sensed it during the battle; otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to deliver the palm strike that saved Zhong Ziya.</p>
<p>However, he never expected Ashen Palm to remain at Rank 10 after advancing to the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen realized how difficult it was to obtain a Speed Crystal of 21 points from a Legendary creature. He might as well kill an Epic creature.</p>
<p>However, with Zhou Wen’s strength alone, it was impossible for him to kill an Epic creature in-game.</p>
<p>Today’s battle with Jiang Yan and company made Zhou Wen understand one thing. He was alone in-game, and that limited him. However, in the real world, there were many powerful humans like Jiang Yan, Zhong Ziya, and Hui Haifeng. As long as they had good teamwork, they could do things that he couldn’t do in-game.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen planned on killing an Epic creature in reality, but before that, he needed to find some powerful helpers.</p>
<p>People like Li Xuan, Wang Lu, and Feng Qiuyan were extremely powerful Legendaries. If he could obtain their help, they had a chance of killing low-level Epic creatureshigh-level Epic creatures were definitely impossible.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen wouldn’t risk his life, nor would he risk Li Xuan and company’s lives. Therefore, he began crazily challenging the instance dungeons.</p>
<p>The grinding this time was different from before. This time, Zhou Wen had especially sought out dungeons found in the college. Furthermore, he targeted dungeons with Epic creatures.</p>
<p>The most common destination was Dragon Gate Grotto. In some of the caves, there were Epic creatures that existed. Zhou Wen tried hunting them one by one.</p>
<p>This resulted in him naturally dying time and time again. When he encountered some powerful Epic creatures, the blood-colored avatar would be instantly killed.</p>
<p>If he encountered a weaker Epic creature, he was able to last a little longer, but that was all. There was no way he could kill those Epic creatures.</p>
<p>The most powerful thing about an Epic creature was that they possessed a Life Soul that had all sorts of powers. Those powers didn’t have the limitations on Primordial Energy, so they could be constantly activated. A stronger Life Soul could instantly kill the blood-colored avatar and a group of his pets. Weaker Life Souls all had their own unique characteristics and possessed all sorts of magical powers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen repeatedly tested in order to find an Epic creature that could possibly be killed by him. Then, he came up with a perfect plan, hoping to find a few capable helpers to kill an Epic creature without taking any risk.</p>
<p>Time passed as the blood-colored avatar constantly died. As he repeatedly probed things way beyond his level, he ended dying instantly most of the time. Having dripped too much blood, Zhou Wen felt that he was beginning to suffer from anemia again.</p>
<p>Yan Zhen’s disappearance didn’t seem to cause too much of a stir. Although the police came to the school to investigate, it was only part of their routine procedures. No one suspected that Yan Zhen had died on campus.</p>
<p>This made Zhou Wen heave a long sigh of relief. However, on second thought, he understood why no one suspected that Yan Zhen had died on campus.</p>
<p>This was because no one knew that he had come to school. Yan Zhen had come to Zhou Wen and wanted to dissect him. This was something clandestine to begin with, so he had definitely made preparations beforehand. He wouldn’t let anyone know that he had come to the school, nor would anyone know that he was here to find Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Upon thinking of Yan Zhen, Zhou Wen glanced at the fruit on the Dead Man Tree. The fruit was already the size of a papaya, and its exterior was white and shiny. It looked like an egg no matter how he looked at it.</p>
<p>On the seventh day of the fruit’s growth, it automatically fell off the tree. Zhou Wen got the blood-colored avatar to pick it up. Indeed, it was a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness: Epic</p>
<p>Life Providence: Golden Left Hand</p>
<p>Life Soul: Dr. Soul</p>
<p>Strength: 21</p>
<p>Speed: 37</p>
<p>Constitution: 26</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 38</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Scalpel, Fight Poison With Poison, Light of Penetration</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>Upon seeing the information on the Companion Egg, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but feel odd. The Doctor Darkness was clearly a replica of Yan Zhen.</p>
<p>Could it be that the power of the Dead Man Tree is to make a dead person a Companion Beast? Then, does Doctor Darkness have Yan Zhen’s memory? Zhou Wen was momentarily hesitant, unsure of how to handle the Companion Egg</p>
<p>Hatching an Epic Companion Egg required too much Primordial Energy. According to Zhou Wen’s previous experience, he was likely able to incubate an Epic Companion Egg using a bug in the game. However, there was a high chance that the Doctor Darkness would suffer a drop in level or be incomplete.</p>
<p>However, if he didn’t hatch it, Zhou Wen was afraid that it would disappear on his next refresh of the game.</p>
<p>Also, if the Doctor Darkness had Yan Zhen’s memories, would he rebel? This was something no one could guarantee.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen chose to incubate Doctor Darkness. He gritted his teeth and infused his Primordial Energy into the Companion Egg.</p>
<p>At the moment the Companion Egg was activated, Zhou Wen felt his Primordial Energy surge like a flood that flowed out of a dam. In a blink of an eye, all his Primordial Energy was drained.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar exploded to its death in-game. Due to the lack of Primordial Energy, the Companion Egg drained the blood-colored avatar’s vitality.</p>
<h3 id='chapter185'>Chapter 185 Rejection</h3>
<p>The blood-colored avatar exploded to death as the game screen turned black.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen dripped another drop of blood and was reborn. When he entered the game again, he saw a Doctor Darkness appear in his Companion Beast window.</p>
<p>He realized that Doctor Darkness had already fallen to the Legendary stage when he took a look at his stats.</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness: Legendary (Youngling)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Golden Left Hand</p>
<p>Speed: 18</p>
<p>Strength: 12</p>
<p>Constitution: 13</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 18</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Scalpel, Fight Poison With</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>He was considered quite a good Companion Beast at the Legendary stage, but that was all. After he evolved into a mature form, he might be able to return to the Epic stage. However, it required a large amount of time to feed him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at Doctor Darkness’s image in-game and thought he looked very similar to Yan Zhen, but he realized that Doctor Darkness wasn’t Yan Zhen.</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness was wearing a white doctor’s robe, but he wasn’t a person, but a human-shaped puppet. He wasn’t of real flesh and blood.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief. He really couldn’t accept it if Doctor Darkness really had looked like Yan Zhen.</p>
<p>After testing the Doctor Darkness’s skills in-game, he realized that he was actually a support-type pet. He was rather formidable when it came to tasks related to surgery, but his true combat power was not even comparable to the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior of the same level.</p>
<p>However, if he was used for surgery, Doctor Darkness was definitely a top-notch Companion Beast. If a doctor had him as a Companion Beast, it was very likely that he could become a famous doctor.</p>
<p>The Scalpel technique allowed precise incisions with an error as small as three decimal places.</p>
<p>Fight Poison With Poison was to use poison to stimulate one’s body, allowing one’s vitality to erupt, to tide through the most dangerous point in surgery. It could even suppress some viruses.</p>
<p>Light of Penetration could be used to see through a patient’s body, far better than X-ray or MRI.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t know medicine. It was a waste giving him such an impressive medical Companion Beast. He didn’t know how to use it at all.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me I need to study medicine now? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed, but on second thought, it wasn’t completely useless.</p>
<p>If he had to deal with some external injuries on the battlefield urgently, Doctor Darkness was still useful. When he returned to the Epic stage in the future, his Dr. Soul Life Soul would be of great help to him in battles.</p>
<p>If I can make the Doctor Darkness return to the Epic stage, it would be much easier for me to kill an Epic creature. However, I wonder how long it will take before I can do this. Zhou Wen kept a happy-go-lucky attitude as he went to Ant City to obtain a few Companion Eggs to feed Doctor Darkness.</p>
<p>Days passed and Ouyang Lan got Ah Sheng to pick him up once again. She said that she had something important to discuss with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Little Wen, have you thought it through? Do you want to participate in the competition for the special physiques?” Ouyang Lan paused before saying, “The competition is about to begin. If you want to participate, you can head to the League’s Holy Land over the next two days.”</p>
<p>“Sis Lan, I don’t wish to go. Can you give the spot to someone else?” Zhou Wen didn’t wish to vie for a special physique. With the Lost Immortal Sutra, even if he didn’t have a special physique, he could still master the Primordial Energy Art of various styles.</p>
<p>“There’s only one chance to change every nomination. I had already used up this opportunity when I changed the nomination to you. There’s no way to change it now. If you don’t go, this nomination would be considered null and void. Little Jing wouldn’t be able to go either,” Ouyang Lan explained as though she had seen through Zhou Wen’s thoughts.</p>
<p>“Sis Lan, I’m really not interested in that nomination. You should think of some other solution if it’s possible.” Zhou Wen felt that going to the Holy Land to vie for those special physiques was a waste of time for him.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan sighed and said, “Since you don’t wish to go, I won’t force you either. Let’s forget about this matter. It’s fine if the nomination is voided. Since it’s useless to us, we’ll just leave it voided.”</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen felt somewhat embarrassed, the nomination wasn’t what he wanted in the first place. It wasn’t his fault for having it voided because of his rejection.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan didn’t mention the matter again. She ordered a few dishes and the two chatted about family matters and school. After the meal, she got Ah Sheng to take Zhou Wen back.</p>
<p>Ah Sheng wasn’t a conversationalist. He didn’t say anything the entire journey until he got Zhou Wen to the entrance of the school. Just as Zhou Wen was about to alight, Ah Sheng suddenly said, “Why didn’t you accept that nomination? Having that nomination isn’t a bad thing for you. Many members of the League’s large families yearn for this spot.”</p>
<p>“I just want to live peacefully. I have no interest in special physiques,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Ah Sheng shook his head and said, “Young Master Wen, perhaps you still don’t know that the League isn’t as peaceful as it seems. In fact, many of the other dimensional zones in the League have had cases of break-outs. Powerful dimensional creatures have rushed out of the dimensional zones and entered the human cities, creating terrifying massacres. Many people have died.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Ah Sheng continued, “Perhaps in a few years, all the dimensional zones will vanish. When that happens, large numbers of dimensional creatures would rush into the human cities. If one doesn’t have the necessary strength, they might not even be family.”</p>
<p>“Is the situation very bad?” Zhou Wen knew that Ah Sheng wasn’t lying. In his dorm, there was a dimensional creature that had broken out and refused to leave. It ate like a lord every day.</p>
<p>“It’s worse than most people can imagine. Not long ago, a military base at Chess Mountain was wiped out, including an Epic-stage commander. Now, Chess Mountain is only temporarily suppressed, and the creatures inside can rush out at any time. When that happens, the dimensional creatures that come out might be even more powerful. Once the military is unable to stop those break-out creatures, the human world will immediately plunge into a disaster.”</p>
<p>Ah Sheng looked into Zhou Wen’s eyes through the rearview mirror and said, “It’s not for anyone. It’s only for your survival in this chaotic world. You should also make a trip to the Holy Land. The things that can be given to you there might allow you to survive in a world of chaos that isn’t too far away.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for telling me this. However, I really do not wish to have anything to do with the An family or take anything from them,” Zhou Wen spoke the heartfelt truth.</p>
<p>affinity that made Zhou Wen believe that he could say what he couldn’t tell others.</p>
<p>Ah Sheng fell silent. After a long while, he sighed and said, “Madam is right. Although your surname isn’t An and you don’t have any blood relations with Overseer An, your temperaments are too similar.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter186'>Chapter 186 Zhou Wen’s Plans</h3>
<p>When Zhou Wen returned to his dorm, his heart felt heavy.</p>
<p>The reality was worse than he imagined. Even an Epic military officer had died in battle outside a dimensional zone, with large numbers of break-out creatures rushing into the cities. Zhou Wen couldn’t imagine how many humans would survive when that happened.</p>
<p>Although he knew that danger wasn’t far away, there was little he could do now. The only thing he could do was to raise his strength as much as possible.</p>
<p>If that day really came, perhaps he could use his own strength to save the people he wanted to save.</p>
<p>He glanced at the antelope sleeping on the couch. This fellow did nothing but eat and sleep all day. Ever since it left Mount Laojun, it hadn’t done anything else.</p>
<p>If only the dimensional creatures in the dimensional zones are the same as you. It would be great if they could just be dealt with by giving them something to eat. Zhou Wen was just musing, knowing that it was impossible.</p>
<p>Even if dimensional creatures didn’t cause trouble for humans, the greedy nature of humans would still plunder their treasures.</p>
<p>Sometimes, as a human, Zhou Wen felt that humans didn’t deserve pity.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar and constantly launched suicidal attacks against various Epic creatures, hoping to find a pushover among them.</p>
<p>His efforts were not in vain. Through the experience gained through death, Zhou Wen saw a sliver of hope.</p>
<p>It was an Epic creature in Dragon Gate Grotto. However, it wasn’t a Fairy, but a tiger in the Binyang Cave. It looked ordinary, so every time Zhou Wen saw it, he wrote it off as an ordinary tiger. It was at best a Mortal-stage creature.</p>
<p>However, when the tiger really began moving, Zhou Wen realized how ridiculously wrong he was. He didn’t put up much of a fight before he was swallowed by the tiger.</p>
<p>Although he had suffered a terrible defeat the first time, Zhou Wen had no choice but to make attempts on the few weaker Epic creatures. Since he had suffered an even worse defeat by other Epic creatures, this was a safer option for now.</p>
<p>He gradually discovered some of the tiger’s habitual weaknesses and after fighting the tiger several times, he was able to last longer.</p>
<p>After countless deaths and repeated experiments, Zhou Wen was certain that it wouldn’t be difficult to kill the tiger if he had two or three powerful helpers.</p>
<p>He already had a detailed plan. As long as he followed the plan, it wouldn’t be difficult to kill the tiger. The problem now was where to find a few powerful helpers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s three senior brothers were very strong, but they had already helped him once, and they hadn’t received any benefits from him. He had yet to return the favor he owed, so it wasn’t appropriate for him to seek their help again.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen made a phone call to Li Xuan and told him that he wanted his help in killing an Epic creature.</p>
<p>“F*ck, Old Zhou, nice one. You are often silent, but once you make a sound, it’s shocking. You’ve actually decided to directly aim your sights at an Epic creature? Whatever, count me in.” Li Xuan agreed without any hesitation. This trust was not something average people had.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else as he got Li Xuan to meet him the next day. There was no point in saying certain things. It was better to let actions speak for themselves to not disappoint him.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen made another phone call to Feng Qiuyan. Feng Qiuyan’s saber techniques were sufficiently powerful, comparable to Zhong Ziya’s sword techniques. He was also a powerful aide.</p>
<p>After explaining his thoughts on killing an Epic creature and telling Feng Qiuyan that he only wanted the Speed Crystals, and wouldn’t claim anything no matter what dropped, Feng Qiuyan didn’t hesitate either. Those other items could be split among themselves.</p>
<p>He directly said, “To be able to fight with Coach is a very good learning opportunity. I don’t need to split the spoils. Just let me participate in the battle.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt like crying when he heard that. What a good classmate and such a kind child. If there were more people like Feng Qiuyan in this world, would there still be things like war?</p>
<p>According to Zhou Wen’s plan, it should be enough to kill the Epic-stage tiger with Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan’s help.</p>
<p>However, taking in the old adages “expect the unexpected” and “man proposes god disposes,” Zhou Wen decided to buy some “insurance” for his first attempt at killing an Epic creature.</p>
<p>Hence, Zhou Wen made another call to Huang Ji and repeated what Feng Qiuyan had said to him. He also told Huang Ji that, other than the Speed Crystal, anything that dropped would be his.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that Huang Ji was also in need of money. As long as Huang Ji believed him, he definitely wouldn’t reject the opportunity to earn money. After all, anything dropped by an Epic creature could sell at a decent price.</p>
<p>“If you had said so earlier, I would definitely have joined you. However, I’m already at the airport and am about to board the plane. I definitely won’t be able to join you,” Huang Ji said.</p>
<p>“Board the plane? Where are you going?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“I have some matters to attend to at the League’s Holy Land. I’m afraid I won’t be able to return anytime soon. If you’re not in a hurry, wait about ten days for me,” said Huang Ji.</p>
<p>“Let’s talk when you come back.” Zhou Wen hung up the phone and thought for a moment before calling Wang Lu to ask if she was interested in hunting an Epic creature.</p>
<p>“Of course I’m interested. How can such an interesting thing happen without me?” Wang Lu said with a smile. It looked like she had recovered pretty well.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, If Wang Lu were to turn into a Companion Egg by the Dead Man Tree, I wonder what kind of form it would be.</p>
<p>After gathering a number of people, Zhou Wen called them over the next morning to give them a detailed explanation of his plans and things to take note of.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, what kind of Epic creature do you want to kill? Fairies in Lotus Flower Cave or the Golden creatures deep in the Myriad Buddha Cave?” Li Xuan asked with a grin.</p>
<p>“Those Epic creatures are too powerful and too dangerous. I want to kill this Epic creature—an epic tiger in Binyang Cave,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s expression turned odd when he heard that. “The tiger you mentioned can’t be the one with white fur, black stripes, and a strange cross pattern on its forehead, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.” Zhou Wen looked at Li Xuan in puzzlement. From Li Xuan’s tone, there seemed to be a problem.</p>
<p>Li Xuan said with a bitter smile, “That tiger is indeed one of the weakest Epics, but the items it drops aren’t bad. They are even very rare and useful. Therefore, the tigers in the Binyang Cave are protected animals. You have to obtain permission to kill it.”</p>
<p>“What rare items can such a weak tiger drop?” Zhou Wen found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>Li Xuan rolled his eyes at him and said, “Have you heard of the story of Buddha cutting his flesh to feed a tiger? It’s said that the tiger in the Binyang Cave is the descendant of that tiger. They aren’t strong, but their Life Providences are one of a kind. They are of immense use and everyone wants them.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter187'>Chapter 187 Baby Tiger of Luck</h3>
<p>“What Life Providence does that tiger have?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Its Life Providence is called the Baby Tiger of Luck. Think about it. A baby tiger that was just about to be eaten by his mother actually encountered Buddha and had Buddha sacrifice his body to feed his mother. Don’t you think it’s lucky?” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Indeed, it’s lucky, very lucky.” Wang Lu nodded.</p>
<p>“Therefore, that baby tiger’s Life Providence is one that comes with an extremely rare luck attribute. If one can obtain a baby tiger Companion Beast and use it to kill dimensional creatures, one will not only have the chances of dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs drop, but also be boosted by several percentage points, the dimensional crystal’s value and the Companion Egg’s attributes will be better than usual. Do you think this item is worth anything?” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“It will be worth a lot. It’s so valuable. Even an excellent-grade Epic Companion Beast might not be worth as much as it,” said Wang Lu firmly.</p>
<p>“Therefore, there are too many people who want the baby tiger. Let’s not talk about us, even those bigwigs will want this baby tiger with them. It’s also because of this that the tiger in Binyang Cave has become an endangered dimensional creature. There have been a few clashes in Binyang Cave in the past. Eventually, the military was deployed to resolve the matter. Later on, they took over the area. You can enter to kill the tiger, but you have to obtain permission from the military. My family has some say in Luoyang, but it’s impossible to get in through the back door. Old Zhou, I think you need to change your plan,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen never expected the tiger he had chosen would be so famous. He couldn’t help but frown as he asked, “Then what should we do to obtain the right to kill the tiger?”.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was very interested in a tiger with a lucky Life Providence, it wasn’t his main goal. All he needed to do was obtain the Speed Crystal.</p>
<p>If he had to formulate a new plan, firstly, it wasn’t easy finding weak Epic creatures and secondly, Zhou Wen and company might not be able to beat them.</p>
<p>“All the bigwigs in Luoyang City grit their teeth in anger when this topic is raised. In the beginning, everyone wanted to get connections to obtain the right to kill the tiger, but think about it. There are so many bigwigs in Luoyang City, so it’s not good for the military to permit and reject people. It might be because they were forced to do so, but I don’t know who came up with the idea. They set up a huge wheel of fortune. They claimed that whether you can get the lucky baby tiger will be decided by luck. Spinning the wheel each time costs 10,000. If you hit it, you are permitted to enter for 24 hours,” Li Xuan said knowingly.</p>
<p>“10,000 a spin isn’t considered expensive. Those bigwigs have plenty of money. Just spend some money. What’s there to be angry about?” Wang Lu asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“If only it were that simple. The wheel of fortune the military set up is electronically controlled. Just pressing a button will automatically spin it. Furthermore, with the military’s dedicated personnel watching over it, there’s no way to interfere with it. The chances of success are what you call low. There was once a bigwig who led his men to spin the wheel of fortune. After a few hundred turns, they failed to hit it at all. In the beginning, the military earned quite a bit of money. It was practically a scam, but there was nothing that could be done about it. Blame it on the bigwigs wanting the baby tiger. It ranges from one to two hundred spins or a few hundred spins to hit it. But even if you hit it, the tiger might not drop a Companion Egg, right?” Li Xuan droned on.</p>
<p>“Isn’t this a scam?” Zhou Wen frowned. He had completely given up on killing the tiger. With so much money, why was he going through all the trouble? He could just buy Speed Crystals?</p>
<p>“It is a scam, but what can you do if you want the baby tiger? However, there are plenty of rich people and bigwigs who don’t care about money to spin that thing. I also wanted to try it in the past, but thinking about how I can’t spin too many times with my allowance, I gave up on this plan,” Li Xuan said as he spread out his hands.</p>
<p>“In that case, it looks like I can only give up on this plan. I’ll do more research when I get back. I’ll find another Epic creature as a target,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to give up. Follow me. I have a way to enter the Binyang Cave,” said Wang Lu with certainty.</p>
<p>“What solutions do you have?” Li Xuan asked Wang Lu in disbelief.</p>
<p>Although Wang Lu had a powerful background, she wasn’t a Luoyang native. Li Xuan refused to believe that she had more say than the Li family that could only enter through the back door.</p>
<p>“Just follow me. You will know when the time comes.” Wang Lu looked confident.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, and Feng Qiuyan had no choice but to follow Wang Lu to the Binyang Cave. Zhou Wen didn’t explain his plan and planned on seeing if Wang Lu could obtain permission to enter the Binyang Cave to kill the tiger. If she couldn’t obtain it, there was no point in explaining it.</p>
<p>Soon, the four of them arrived outside the Binyang Cave. It was not completely sealed off. Only the cave where the baby tiger appeared had the military managing it.</p>
<p>Not long after Li Xuan had brought Zhou Wen and company into the Binyang Cave, they saw a soldier guarding a cave entrance. Beside the cave’s entrance was a wheel of fortune.</p>
<p>The white wheel of fortune was very eye-catching, but there was a thin red line that looked like a strand of hair. The needle had to hit the red line precisely before the system could automatically determine a jackpot.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that it was an electronic wheel of fortune, even if it was manually spun, it would not be easy to hit it.</p>
<p>There was only a red button on the entire wheel. It had pressure sensors that allowed for longer and faster spinning by pressing the button forcefully and a slower and short spin with a gentle press. The only thing that could be controlled was this button.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to use Truth Listener’s hearing to hear the internal structure of the wheel, but he couldn’t hear anything. He didn’t know what device was installed in it.</p>
<p>“How long would it take to kill that tiger?” Wang Lu asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“If it’s only to kill, it should be fast. If nothing goes wrong, it’s at most half an hour.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment. He could have the tiger repeatedly appear in-game, but he didn’t know how long it would take for these tigers to burrow through a spatial rift.</p>
<p>Li Xuan said, “I heard that a tiger will appear every two to three days. Furthermore, there is usually only one tiger in the cave at a time. There won’t be multiple tigers appearing together. We have no idea if a tiger has been killed.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I got it.” As Wang Lu spoke, she walked towards the wheel of fortune and said to the guard, “I’m going to spin three times. How do I pay?”</p>
<p>“Card, QR code, or bank transfer.” The soldier smiled.</p>
<p>“Wang Lu, don’t tell me your method is to throw money at it? Then why don’t you just give the money to Zhou Wen so that he can buy a Speed Crystal?” Li Xuan said with widened eyes.</p>
<h3 id='chapter188'>Chapter 188 The Spinning Wheel</h3>
<p>“Just watch.” As Wang Lu said that, she scanned the QR code to make payment and walked to the wheel of fortune. After being checked by the military, she pressed a red button.</p>
<p>The wheel started spinning, stopping only after a while.</p>
<p>Tick! Tick! Tick! Tick!</p>
<p>When the wheel stopped moving, Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, and Feng Qiuyan’s eyes widened as they looked incredulously at the wheel of fortune.</p>
<p>He saw that the needle had stopped at the red line that was as thin as a hair strand. The light on the wheel of fortune lit up, accompanied by a jackpot sound.</p>
<p>“D*mn, what kind of dog sh*t luck did you get? You actually hit it in one shot!” Li Xuan’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>An officer walked over but did not congratulate Wang Lu for winning the prize. Instead, he carefully checked the wheel of fortune and tried spinning it a few more times. After confirming that everything was normal, he said to Wang Lu, “Miss, you are really lucky. Congratulations on obtaining twenty-four hours. You may enter now.”</p>
<p>“Hold on, I still have two more chances,” Wang Lu said as she pressed her palm on the red button again, making the wheel spin again.</p>
<p>When the wheel stopped, Li Xuan, Zhou Xuan, and Feng Qiuyan widened their mouths as they looked at Wang Lu and the wheel as though they were watching an alien.</p>
<p>All that could be seen was flashing lights and music fanfare playing. Wang Lu had hit the jackpot again.</p>
<p>The officer’s expression changed and he quickly checked the machine again. In the end, everything was still normal. He tried many times but failed to get it. Clearly, there was no problem with the wheel of fortune.</p>
<p>“Miss, congratulations on obtaining another 24 hours. There’s still one more chance. Are you still spinning?” The officer stared at Wang Lu and asked. Clearly, he suspected that there was something wrong with Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“Why not? I did spend the money,” Wang Lu said as she pressed her palm onto the red button.</p>
<p>This time, the officer stared intently at Wang Lu the entire time. He wanted to know if she had used any powers to interfere with the wheel of fortune. He was in charge of this area and had special abilities. If powers affected the wheel, it would be impossible for him not to notice.</p>
<p>However, despite staring at Wang Lu from beginning to end, he realized that she hadn’t used any powers to cheat, but when the needle stopped, the wheel of fortune’s light lit up again.</p>
<p>A cold sweat broke out on the officer’s forehead. He didn’t believe that a Legendary student could cheat in front of him. However, surely it was impossible for her to hit the jackpot three times in a row. It was virtually impossible. The wheel’s program didn’t allow for such a high probability of hitting the jackpot.</p>
<p>“72 hours. That should be enough, right?” Wang Lu returned to Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>“Enough… Enough…” Li Xuan and company subconsciously nodded in response.</p>
<p>The officer and soldiers looked at her as though she was a monster as the four entered the cave together.</p>
<p>“Wang Lu, how did you do it? I’m willing to pay to buy your method.” When they arrived at an uninhabited spot, Li Xuan hurriedly asked Wang Lu. He believed that Wang Lu had definitely cheated, but they just couldn’t tell.</p>
<p>Wang Lu smiled and said, “There’s no method. I just pressed the button a few times and hit the jackpot.”</p>
<p>“Tch, forget it if you don’t want to say.” Li Xuan naturally refused to believe it.</p>
<p>Seeing that he didn’t believe her, Wang Lu added, “I don’t have anything that stands out, but my luck is a little better than the average person’s. I heard from my dad that before I learned how to walk, he took me out for a stroll. I climbed out of the pram myself and picked up a piece of paper on the grass. Who knew that it was actually a lottery ticket. It even won the first prize that day. It was only seven or eight million. I can’t remember. When I was in kindergarten, I bought a second-hand hair clip for three bucks, but to my surprise, there was a high-valued crystal embedded in it. When I was in middle school…”</p>
<p>“Are you kidding me?” Li Xuan refused to believe that such a lucky person existed in this world. After all, he had never won the lottery before, much less picked a winning ticket from the ground. What Wang Lu said was basically spinning tales.</p>
<p>“Do you have any coins on you?” Wang Lu said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Yes, you want to do a coin flip?” Li Xuan said as he took out a coin.</p>
<p>“I’ll buy ten heads. Flip it,” said Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“Tch, I really don’t believe it.” Li Xuan threw his coin into the air, but when it landed, it was really heads.</p>
<p>After ten consecutive flips, Li Xuan looked at Wang Lu as though he had seen a ghost.</p>
<p>“Sister Lu, can I call you sister? You are the humanoid version of the lucky baby tiger. Are you free tomorrow? The two of us can make a trip to the rich…” When Li Xuan jolted to his senses, he nearly pounced forward to hug Wang Lu’s thigh.</p>
<p>“I’m not free.” Wang Lu mercilessly rejected Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Alright, stop fooling around. I’ll discuss the detailed plan first. In a while, you must listen to my instructions and not make any mistakes. Although that tiger isn’t a very strong Epic creature, it’s still at the Epic stage. Any tiny mistake could kill us.” Zhou Wen repeatedly exhorted them not to be careless.</p>
<p>The tiger was just relatively weak compared to an Epic stage powerhouse. When compared to Legendaries like them, it was undoubtedly a super big boss to them.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. We aren’t fools. We know that it’s very dangerous. But Old Zhou, you haven’t killed a tiger before. Where did this strategy come from?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“I watched videos on the Internet,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Damn, can you be any more reliable? Those videos are experts at the Epic stage fighting. We are far inferior to them,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“If you don’t make a mistake, it will be very reliable.” Zhou Wen was very certain that his plan wasn’t problematic. He had already tried it countless times, but he was lacking in strength, so he couldn’t put his plan into action.</p>
<p>He explained the detailed plan to the three of them, especially their positioning and cooperation. Zhou Wen had them practice it several times and only after seeing that they were familiar with the positioning did he confirm that there was no problem. He then led them deep into the cave.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, can you change this plan? Let Wang Lu deliver the final blow to the tiger?” Li Xuan asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Sure,” Zhou Wen agreed readily.</p>
<p>Based on Wang Lu’s nearly sick luck, killing the tiger would definitely result in something dropping.</p>
<p>Tigers were so rare. If it didn’t drop anything, they would have to wait a few more days before they could try their luck again.</p>
<p>However, to their surprise, Wang Lu shook her head and said, “I don’t like killing. It’s best you do it yourselves.”</p>
<p>After passing through a few caves, they suddenly saw a tiger covered in white fur and black stripes lying on a boulder in front of them. The tiger also noticed Zhou Wen and company. With a roar, it pounced down from the rock and attacked them.</p>
<p>“Xuan, left; Feng, right; Lu, back.” In order to reduce the troubles while giving commands, Zhou Wen only said one word in their names.</p>
<h3 id='chapter189'>Chapter 189 You Owe Me</h3>
<p>“Is this really an Epic creature?” Twenty minutes later, Li Xuan looked in disbelief at the tiger lying in a pool of blood. He found it unbelievable that it was an Epic creature.</p>
<p>In just twenty minutes, they killed the tiger without any injuries. It was so simple that it was unbelievable.</p>
<p>“Is there another tiger beside it?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I know it’s weak, but I never expected it to be so weak. It was like one of the weakest Epic creatures,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>However, Feng Qiuyan said in a serious tone, “No, it’s not that the tiger is weak, it’s that Coach’s plan is so targeted. The tiger didn’t have the ability to utilize its potential and was suppressed by us. If it wasn’t for Coach’s plan, it would be questionable if we could have killed it.”</p>
<p>“Old Feng, you really don’t have any sense of humor.” Li Xuan curled his lips and said, “Forget it. Old Feng, go take a look and see if there’s anything good in the tiger’s body. It’s best if it can release Speed Crystals, lest we accompany Zhou Wen again next time.”</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan didn’t say a word. He walked straight to the tiger’s corpse and dissected it. Soon, he dug out a crystalline white Companion Egg.</p>
<p>“F*ck, Lucky Baby Tiger!” Li Xuan widened his eyes. Their luck was just too good. They had killed a tiger and ended up having a Companion Egg drop. It was unknown how those bigwigs who had killed countless tigers without having a Companion Egg drop would feel.</p>
<p>“How do we split the Companion Egg?” asked Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“I’ve said it before. All I want are Speed Crystals. Whatever else dropped will be yours.” Zhou Wen was the first to excuse himself. He had already said it before coming, so he naturally wouldn’t go back on his word just because of a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Although the tiger was precious, and it was difficult for others to obtain it, Zhou Wen could kill it in-game. It wouldn’t be difficult to obtain it in the future.</p>
<p>“I came just to help Zhou Wen. I also said that I wouldn’t take anything,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“I don’t want it.” Feng Qiuyan was even more straightforward.</p>
<p>“I really want it, but it’s too valuable. It’s not appropriate for me to take it myself. Let’s do it this way. I’ll accept the Companion Egg. Your share will be converted into money or something,” said Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“Are we people who lack money? Rather than money, why don’t you help us enter a few more times in the future? Firstly, we can help Zhou Wen get the Speed Crystals he wants. Secondly, we can also try to see if we can get a few more tigers to drop. When the time comes, we can each bring one out to enjoy the breeze,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“No problem. I’ll be there as you wish.” Wang Lu also knew that it was indeed difficult to calculate something like a lucky tiger using money. To take it away, she had to owe them favors.</p>
<p>There would only be a second tiger in three days. The four of them had no choice but to head back now and come back three days later.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a little depressed. He had read from a thread that the tiger easily dropped Speed Crystals. Maybe Wang Lu’s luck was so good that it affected the tiger’s drop-rate, resulting in a Companion Egg being dropped.</p>
<p>It’s still three days before we can kill the tiger. It’s too long. I’d better do more research and see if there are any other Epic creatures that can be killed. Just as Zhou Wen was about to begin gaming, he suddenly heard a knock on the door.</p>
<p>When he opened the door, he saw that it was actually An Jing.</p>
<p>“Is there a reason you are looking for me?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Can we talk inside?” An Jing appeared rather calm this time. Her expression did not change at all.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Zhou Wen let An Jing in and poured her a cup of tea.</p>
<p>An Jing didn’t touch the teacup as she looked at Zhou Wen and asked, “Why did you refuse to participate in the competition for special physiques?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that what you wanted?” Zhou Wen asked casually.</p>
<p>An Jing looked at Zhou Wen and continued, “Is that why you refused to participate in the competition?”</p>
<p>“It’s part of the reason. Since this is your spot, I’m not interested or have any desires in having it,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You should know that there’s no way to change the nomination. I can’t go even if you don’t,” said An Jing.</p>
<p>“I know, but your things are yours. I can’t take your things away just because you don’t need them,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I understand.” An Jing nodded slightly as she pondered for a moment before looking up at Zhou Wen. “Do you still remember that you agreed to owe me a condition when I brought you into the military camp?”</p>
<p>“Of course I do. You can raise conditions at any time, but it has to be within my abilities, I won’t do anything that harms others.” Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t forget the favor he owed.</p>
<p>“It’s fine as long as you recognize the debt. Then prepare yourselves. Ah Sheng will take you to the Holy Land tomorrow,” said An Jing.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen was taken aback.</p>
<p>“My condition is for you to represent me in the competition for special physiques. Is that clear enough? Do you understand?” she said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Why do you want me to go? Haven’t you always wanted to prevent me from getting that spot?” Zhou Wen frowned as he looked at An Jing, unsure of her thoughts.</p>
<p>Previously, An Jing had tried her best to stop him. She had even transferred to Guide High School to fight him, but now she was the one forcing him to go.</p>
<p>“On Uncle Feng’s account, it’s not appropriate for me to personally teach you a lesson. However, there are many geniuses in the Holy Land. It would be appropriate to get them to teach you a lesson and help me vent my anger. It will also let my mother and grandfather know that the person they have high hopes for is useless. Only I can help the An family obtain a special physique.” With that said, An Jing turned to leave Zhou Wen’s dorm. When she reached his door, she stopped and said without turning her head, “Remember, Ah Sheng will pick you up at ten tomorrow. You owe me this.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss for words as he watched An Jing leave in a daze.</p>
<p>Should I go or not? Zhou Wen was somewhat hesitant.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to have anything to do with the An siblings, so he would rather have An Jing’s nomination be voided than go.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, An Jing had used the condition in exchange, forcing him to go to the Holy Land. Zhou Wen didn’t know why An Jing would do that, so he was somewhat hesitant.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen took out his ordinary phone and called Ouyang Lan.</p>
<p>“Little Wen, what’s the matter?” Ouyang Lan remained as cordial as ever. Even though Zhou Wen had rejected her the last time, her attitude towards Zhou Wen didn’t change.</p>
<p>“Sis Lan, can’t we switch it to having An Jing head to the Holy Land?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“It really can’t be done. If it were any other family, it might still be possible. However, the League has always been wary of the An family. They can’t wait to wipe away the An family’s nomination, so how could they give the An family another chance?” Ouyang Lan paused for a moment before continuing, “You don’t need to feel burdened. If you don’t want to go, so be it. Speaking of which, I was a little selfish. As it’s too dangerous there, I wasn’t willing to let my daughter take the risk. Instead, I pushed you to the forefront. It was my bad.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter190'>Chapter 190 Crystal Purchase</h3>
<p>“Sis Lan, can you give me the information about the Holy Land?” Zhou Wen thought for a moment. Since he didn’t wish to owe the An family any favors, he was prepared to make a trip to the Holy Land regardless of An Jing’s motives as payment.</p>
<p>“You really don’t have to force yourself. It’s fine if you don’t go,” Ouyang Lan said.</p>
<p>“I wish to take a look,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Alright then. I’ll send you the information on the Holy Land.” Ouyang Lan paused before continuing, “Look through the information first. If you aren’t confident, don’t go. If anything happens to you, I won’t be able to answer Lingfeng.”</p>
<p>“Alright, Sis Lan, send me the information first,” Zhou Wen said vaguely.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan sent the information of the Holy Land to Zhou Wen. Only after seeing it did he realize that the Holy Land was actually a large dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Unlike ordinary dimensional zones, there were extremely powerful creatures in it. These creatures were actually willing to give human special bloodlines to change their physiques.</p>
<p>However, powerful creatures would not casually bestow human bloodlines. They had to pass their tests to obtain their bloodlines.</p>
<p>Currently, the known bloodlines were those of the six heroes. Previously, John’s Holy Emperor Body was one of them. However, the bloodline John had inherited naturally couldn’t be compared to the first generation’s Holy Emperor Body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen the Holy Emperor Body before. The other five types of physiques were all unique. The most detailed description was a body known as the Sun God Body. It was an extremely masculine type that needed one to cultivate an extreme Yang-elemental Primordial Energy Art to pass the test.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the Sun Strafe Art was prepared for the Sun God Body, but unfortunately, Zhou Wen didn’t cultivate the Sun Strafe Art. It was hard to tell if he could obtain the Sun God Body when the time came.</p>
<p>“Sis Lan, I’ve already thought about it. I want to go to the Holy Land.” Zhou Wen felt that there was no harm in making a trip there. He could return the favor he owed An Jing and also attempt to download the Holy Land into his phone.</p>
<p>If possible, he might be able to use the Lost Immortal Sutra to obtain many special physiques in the Holy Land.</p>
<p>“I thought about it carefully and felt that it was best if you don’t go,” Ouyang Lan suddenly said.</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan said with a wry smile, “Back when Tianzuo was young, he went once. However, no one received any special physiques during the trip.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen was even more puzzled.</p>
<p>“Ahem. When he went there, there was some unhappiness between him and the other youths who went. It devolved into an armed melee. That’s why the other contestants from other families were rather unfriendly to our An family. If you represent the An family, they will target you. It will be very troublesome when the time comes, so it’s best you don’t go,” Ouyang Lan said.</p>
<p>“Those that can enter the Holy Land are at most at the Legendary stage, right?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.</p>
<p>“Yes, the Holy Land has restrictions. One cannot enter if they surpass the Legendary stage,” Ouyang Lan said.</p>
<p>“I’ll go,” Zhou Wen said through gritted teeth. Perhaps it was as An Jing had said. There would be many elites waiting to teach him a lesson, but since he had agreed to return the favor, there was no reason for him to shrink back now.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan added some things to take note of and got Zhou Wen to be careful. Having a chance to obtain a special physique was the best, but it didn’t matter if he didn’t get it. Safety was the priority.</p>
<p>Why are the mother’s and daughter’s temperament so different? If it wasn’t for the fact that An Jing had a unique appearance like Ouyang Lan, Zhou Wen really would suspect that An Jing wasn’t Ouyang Lan’s biological daughter.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had decided on heading to the Holy Land, he had to raise his speed to 21 points first. He could head there after refining the Mutated Fairy Primordial Energy Skill Crystal.</p>
<p>It’s definitely too late to kill the tiger now. Ignoring the fact that there aren’t any tigers in Binyang Cave, even if there are, killing it might not necessarily result in a Speed Crystal. After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that there was only one path he could take. He had to buy a 21-valued Speed Crystal from a crystal shop.</p>
<p>Epic grade crystals weren’t cheap. Fortunately, a 21-valued Speed Crystal was considered one of the lowest grade crystals at the Epic stage, so the price wasn’t too ridiculous.</p>
<p>However, even so, the price wasn’t something an ordinary person could accept. If it wasn’t for the urgency of the matter, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have chosen to spend money to buy it. After all, he lacked money.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen requested Ah Sheng’s help to settle the administrative procedures for his suspension at school. Since he was going to the Holy Land tomorrow, he definitely wouldn’t be able to return in half a month. A day or two didn’t matter.</p>
<p>He got Ah Sheng to drive him to the Xiyuan Crystal Shop. This time, there were many customers there, unlike the last time, when it was only Zhou Wen and Ouyang Lan.</p>
<p>When he passed by the code lockers, Zhou Wen took another look and couldn’t help but recall the numbers on the name card.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen didn’t know what those numbers meant and wasn’t sure if it was the passcode for a locker.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, what kind of stat crystal do you want to buy?” Ah Sheng asked when he saw Zhou Wen walk to the crystal cabinet.</p>
<p>“I want to buy an Epic Speed Crystal. Just 21 points would do,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, you haven’t advanced to the Epic stage yet. It’s too dangerous to absorb an Epic stage crystal right now. If you need higher valued Legendary crystals, I can prepare them for you,” Ah Sheng said.</p>
<p>“There’s no need.” Zhou Wen shook his head in rejection. The crystals Ah Sheng had brought were naturally given to him by the An family.</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng, what brings you here today?” Zhou Wen was looking at the crystal when he suddenly heard an elder’s voice. He turned his head and saw that the person speaking was an old man with a sickly look.</p>
<p>“Old Master Qin, I’m here to accompany Young Master Wen to buy crystals,” Ah Wen replied respectfully.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen realize that the sickly old man in front of him was likely the owner of Xiyuan Crystal Shop, Qin Xiyuan.</p>
<p>Qin Xiyuan appeared somewhat surprised as he looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Lad, you’re Zhou Wen?”</p>
<p>“Old Master Qin, you know me?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>Qin Xiyuan said with a smile, “Of course I know. There’s probably no one in Luoyang City who doesn’t know about Little Lan’s marriage with your father.”</p>
<p>With that said, Qin Xiyuan pulled Zhou Wen’s hand and walked him deeper into the store. As he walked, he said, “The things outside are just to fool ordinary people. You are one of Little Lan’s. Come to my treasury and take a look.”</p>
<p>“Old Master, I just want to buy an Epic Speed Crystal. Just an ordinary one would do,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if you are buying. Take a look first,” Qin Xiyuan said with a chuckle as he pulled Zhou Wen into the elevator.</p>
<p>Qin Xiyuan led him straight to the fourth floor. After exiting the elevator, he said to Ah Sheng, “Ah Sheng, stay here and watch. Don’t let anyone disturb us.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter191'>Chapter 191 Qin Xiyuan</h3>
<p>“This Companion Beast’s name is the Skygod Crane. It was sent here by an Epic expert, Lu Jiuyun. This Skygod Crane’s speed is extremely fast. Furthermore, its Life Providence and Life Soul are pretty good…” Qin Xiyuan held Zhou Wen’s hand as he warmly introduced the Companion Beasts in basement four.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt odd. He was clearly here to buy a Speed Crystal, so why did Qin Xiyuan introduce these Companion Beasts to him?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had tried to emphasize the purpose of his visit several times, but he couldn’t find a chance to interject.</p>
<p>In fact, when Ouyang Lan brought Zhou Wen here, she had already told him everything. However, with Qin Xiyuan’s enthusiasm, Zhou Wen could only patiently listen.</p>
<p>Without realizing it, the two came to the room with the chained silver-haired Companion Beast. After entering the room, Qin Xiyuan suddenly said to Zhou Wen, “Zhou Wen, do you know that you are in danger?”</p>
<p>“Old Master Qin, what do you mean?” Zhou Wen looked at Qin Xiyuan in confusion.</p>
<p>Qin Xiyuan looked outside and saw that Ah Sheng was still guarding the fourth level entrance. He whispered to Zhou Wen, “Everyone in Luoyang City knows that Little Lan married another man, but they don’t know much about that man. At most, they know his surname is Zhou, much less know that he has a son named Zhou Wen.”</p>
<p>“Then how did you know about me?” Zhou Wen asked Qin Xiyuan.</p>
<p>“It was Ouyang who told me. He said that he thinks highly of you and you are outstanding. If possible, he hopes that you can take over his job in the future,” said Qin Xiyuan.</p>
<p>“What job?” Zhou Wen looked at Qin Xiyuan in confusion.</p>
<p>Qin Xiyuan smiled bitterly and said, “Ouyang is still as cautious as ever. He thought highly of you but didn’t tell you anything?”</p>
<p>“The former principal has indeed praised me for my talent, but that was just a casual remark. Don’t treat it seriously.” Zhou Wen paused and looked at Qin Xiyuan. “Old Master Qin, doesn’t the former principal study history? I’m not familiar with this area and am not very interested in it. You must have heard wrongly that the former principal asked me to take over his job, right?”</p>
<p>“It can’t be wrong. Ouyang gave you the passcode, right? Did you see the metal slab over there? Enter the code. The items inside were all left by Ouyang. They should be of some help to you,” Qin Xiyuan said as he pointed behind the silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<p>What he was referring to was the metal slab with the ship’s anchor emblem engraved on it. The last time Zhou Wen came, he had seen the keypad on it. He guessed that it might be a password lock, but he never expected it to be true.</p>
<p>Despite having those thoughts, Zhou Wen’s expression remained stoic as he feigned surprise. “Old Master Qin, what password are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t Ouyang give you the passcode? That’s bad. It’s all the things he left for you. You can’t open without the passcode, so you can only wait for him to return,” Qin Xiyuan said as he stared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“The former principal left something for me? He even wants me to take over his job. Why haven’t I heard him mention it before? I’ll have to ask him when he returns,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Did Ouyang really not tell you anything?” Qin Xiyuan asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“Back when the former principal was still in Guide High School, he often chatted with me, but he didn’t leave anything for me. Also, what was the danger that you mentioned?” Zhou Wen asked Qin Xiyuan.</p>
<p>“The things Ouyang left for you are very important. If others know that you have the items, it will definitely be disadvantageous to you. So you must hide them well and not let anyone see them.” Qin Xiyuan said sternly.</p>
<p>“What are the things?” The puzzlement on Zhou Wen’s face wasn’t faked. He really didn’t know what the former principal had left him.</p>
<p>“Since you don’t know anything, that can be considered a good thing. Forget it. Since Ouyang didn’t tell you the details, let’s wait until he comes back.” Qin Xiyuan saw that Zhou Wen didn’t seem to be faking it, so he didn’t say anything else and left the room with the silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<p>When Qin Xiyuan closed the door, Zhou Wen glanced at the silver-haired Companion Beast. Just like the last time he came, the Companion Beast was still sitting there with his head lowered. His long silver hair covered his face, masking his appearance.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that a pair of eyes were staring at him behind the waterfall-like silver hair. Furthermore, they were smiling at him.</p>
<p>After leaving basement four, Qin Xiyuan got someone to give him the Speed Crystal which Zhou Wen needed. He gave him a very high discount, and eventually, Zhou Wen paid 138,000 for the 21-valued Speed Crystal.</p>
<p>On the way back, Zhou Wen’s mind wasn’t on the Speed Crystal.</p>
<p>Is the number on the name card really from the former principal? Is that string of numbers really used to open the metal slab? Zhou Wen was extremely puzzled as he felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Qin Xiyuan said those words, Zhou Wen only pretended not to understand anything. In fact, he really didn’t quite understand.</p>
<p>Sir, what’s going on? Zhou Wen was filled with doubt.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen left his store, Qin Xiyuan sat on a chair in his office. He was using the mouse to click on the video and repeatedly replayed the entire conversation he had with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>After watching for a while, Qin Xiyuan muttered to himself, It looks like I’m overthinking things. This kid really doesn’t know. Who did that old fool Ouyang pass the passcode to? He didn’t even tell his own daughter. Could that old fool have wanted that thing to die together with him?</p>
<p>After returning to his dorm, Zhou Wen took out the 21-valued Speed Crystal and attempted to snap a picture to put it inside the game.</p>
<p>It was very dangerous to directly absorb stat crystals that exceeded one’s level. Although Zhou Wen’s body was powerful, he wasn’t willing to take the risk.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen was somewhat worried. A Legendary stage definitely had its limits, but he didn’t know what the limit was. A person’s limit was 18. His was clearly higher than the average person’s, but he had no confidence in reaching 21 points.</p>
<p>The Speed Crystal successfully entered the game, the moment the blood-colored avatar touched it, it immediately transformed into a stream of light that fused into the blood-colored avatar’s body. It made Zhou Wen feel as though a force had fused into his muscles, strengthening them.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar’s speed quickly increased by one point and became 19. Soon, it increased by another point and became 20.</p>
<p>However, when the Speed Crystal was completely absorbed by the blood-colored avatar, his Speed stat stopped increasing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat. He knew what he was most worried about had happened. His Legendary stats hit the limit at 20 points, so he was unable to increase his Speed to 21 points. Unless he advanced to the Epic stage, he wouldn’t be able to learn the Dragon Gate Flying Immortal Skill.</p>
<h3 id='chapter192'>Chapter 192 Hope of Breaking Through</h3>
<p>At the Mortal stage, the Lost Immortal Sutra simulated four types of Primordial Energy Arts to boost my stats to 11 points. But now, those Primordial Energy Arts have already reached the Legendary stage, but it hasn’t increased my stats. How do I have my stats break through to 21 points? Zhou Wen frowned in thought.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, I heard you are representing the An family and will be heading to the Holy Land?” Li Xuan ran over and sized up Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Yes, I just decided to go yesterday. How did you know?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“It’s almost time to enter the Holy Land, so the League has already released the list with your name on it. The An family sure treats you well. They actually gave you this spot.” Li Xuan was very surprised. He never expected the An family to give the spot to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>If I didn’t have to go, I really wouldn’t have gone, Zhou Wen thought to himself, but there was no point in saying that now. Therefore, Zhou Wen only asked, “Does that mean you are going too?”</p>
<p>Li Xuan curled his lips and said, “If Brother were to talk to me nicely, I might have even given it to him. However, with what he has done, I’ll definitely not let him get his wish.”</p>
<p>“By the way, how are you getting to the Holy Land? Let’s go together? We can join forces and forge a path of blood together. Each of us will obtain a special physique and return. Later, we will then have a mythical pet.” Li Xuan rattled on. “Have you thought about which type of physique you will be vying for? Different physiques have different Primordial Energy Art requirements. You have to cultivate the corresponding Primordial Energy Art to have a possibility of passing.”</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to answer, his eyes suddenly lit up as he thought to himself, That’s right. Why didn’t I think of it? Although the Lost Immortal Sutra has the power to confuse Immortals and Buddhas, making those Immortals and Buddhas think that I have a special physique, I actually do not have one. Could the special physiques in the Holy Land allow my body to exceed the limits of the Legendary stage?</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen suddenly felt that his trip wasn’t necessarily a bad thing.</p>
<p>“Hey, what are you doing? I’m asking you a question,” Li Xuan said as he waved his hand at Zhou Wen when he saw him looking down in a daze.</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng will be taking me there.” Zhou Wen snapped out of his daze and explained.</p>
<p>“Then tell Ah Sheng to take one more person. I’ll go with you for company,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t be a problem. I’ll inform him later, but there will be trouble plaguing me. If you come with me, I’m afraid it won’t be too peaceful,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“People live in this world to resolve all kinds of trouble. There’s no point fearing it. Alright, I’ll head back to pack up.” Li Xuan bade farewell and left.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen called Ah Sheng, but he never expected Ah Sheng to say, “Young Master Wen, it’s best if you don’t go with Li Xuan.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“There are some internal problems with the Li family. I’m afraid that it won’t be safe on our trip.” Ah Sheng wasn’t too direct, but Zhou Wen knew that the problem he was referring to was probably Li Xuan’s second brother, Li Mobai.</p>
<p>“I’m also in trouble. Li Xuan isn’t afraid of trouble, so what’s there for me to be afraid of?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>After hanging up, Zhou Wen went to Old Dragon Cave. Ah Sheng could help him apply for a leave of absence, but Zhou Wen still wanted to inform Wang Mingyuan and company before he left.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen arrived at the laboratory, he saw the rare sight of Zhong Ziya, Hui Haifeng, and Jiang Yan there. Furthermore, Zhong Ziya wasn’t sleeping and Jiang Yan wasn’t reading. The three of them were playing cards.</p>
<p>Not seeing Wang Mingyuan, Zhou Wen asked, “Where’s Teacher?”</p>
<p>“He’s down Dragon’s Well. He should be back soon,” Hui Haifeng answered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but worry when he heard that Wang Mingyuan had gone into Dragon’s Well again.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng and company had never seen the dragon at the bottom of Dragon’s Well, but Zhou Wen had experienced it deeply. Although Wang Mingyuan was at the Epic stage, he might not be a match for the dragon.</p>
<p>Sitting by the side and watching the trio play cards, he felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out how the trio was playing, despite watching for quite some time.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya had thrown a 7, and Hui Haifeng had thrown an 8, but Jiang Guan threw a 5. No matter how he thought about it, 5 wasn’t bigger than 8.</p>
<p>“What kind of game are you playing?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Just a random game,” Hui Haifeng said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya continued, “There’s no point in playing a proper game of cards. This is called Reverse. We’ll select one person to play cards in reverse while the other two play normally.”</p>
<p>This was the first time Zhou Wen saw that cards could be played this way.</p>
<p>He found it more interesting as he watched. A clearly big card was used as a small card in Jiang Yan’s hand, while his smallest 3 to 5s all became the biggest cards.</p>
<p>However, playing cards in such a way made it prone to confusion, especially for an ordinary person. However, the three of them played with relish and never made any mistakes.</p>
<p>After waiting for more than an hour, Wang Mingyuan came out of Dragon’s Well. Zhou Wen recounted how he was going to the Holy Land.</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect the An family to give you the nomination. If you really want to go, you have to be careful.” Hui Haifeng spoke up first.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen’s puzzled expression, Hui Haifeng said with a smile, “Back when An Tianzuo was about the same age as us, he went to the Holy Land. He didn’t obtain any special physiques, but he beat the descendants of the six heroes who went to the Holy Land one after another. He caused all the descendants of the six heroes to fall out and none of them obtained any special physiques. This resulted in a great feud. As a representative of the An family, you will likely be targeted.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was dumbfounded when he heard that. Only then did he know that the trouble Ouyang Lan mentioned was really troublesome.</p>
<p>“Why did An Tianzuo do that?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Rumor has it that An Tianzuo was too arrogant. He said that it was meaningless for the descendants of the Six Hero families to get the special physiques every time, so he beat them to a pulp and made them have to quit. But this is just a rumor. Only the real people involved know the truth,” Hui Haifeng said.</p>
<p>“If you don’t have to go, it’s best you don’t go. A special physique might not necessarily be good,” Zhong Ziya said with a twitch of his lips.</p>
<p>“I’ve already promised the An family,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You’ll have to go if you have promised, but after you get there, you must take note of someone called Lance,” said Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>“What’s so special about that person?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Lance is also a descendant of the six heroes. Although his fame isn’t as great as John’s, he’s thousands of times more terrifying than John. With your abilities and Companion Beasts, it won’t be difficult for you to deal with the descendants of the other six heroes, but if you encounter this person, you have to be careful.” Jiang Yan said very seriously without any intention of joking.</p>
<p>“Lance, I’ll remember him.” Zhou Wen repeated the name Jiang Yan mentioned and silently memorized it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter193'>Chapter 193 Qin Mountain</h3>
<p>When Zhou Wen left, there was a necklace around his neck. Although it was a necklace, it was actually a red string with a bead carved from ivory.</p>
<p>This was given to him by Wang Mingyuan who claimed to have made it personally. He originally planned on giving each of them one after making all four. Since Zhou Wen was leaving for some time, he wanted to give him the completed one first.</p>
<p>The next morning, Ah Sheng came to fetch Zhou Wen and Li Xuan, and Ouyang Lan came over. Before leaving, she specially exhorted Zhou Wen, “Little Wen, I’m not worried about your strength, but I’m afraid that you might be careless. After you reach the Holy Land, you have to be careful of the descendants of the six heroes. The grudge from back then between Tianzuo and the six heroes is so deep, they will definitely target you. Remember, safety first. It’s nice to obtain a special physique, but it doesn’t matter if you don’t.”</p>
<p>“Sis Lan, I understand.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.</p>
<p>If this were in the past, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have taken the special physique to heart, but in order to break through, Zhou Wen had to vie for it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that they were taking a plane to the Holy City, but to his surprise, Ah Sheng drove them out of Luoyang city without heading to the airport.</p>
<p>“Brother Sheng, isn’t it too slow by car?” Li Xuan didn’t dare call him Ah Sheng, so he called him Brother Sheng.</p>
<p>Previously, Li Xuan had told Zhou Wen that although An Sheng was only picked up by An Tianzuo and was not a true member of the An family, An Tianzuo treated him like a brother.</p>
<p>In the An family, he was Ah Sheng, but outside, An Sheng’s name was frightening.</p>
<p>“This was ordered by Madam. There are many routes to choose from so the roads are safer. Furthermore, there are a few dimensional zones. I want you to visit them before heading to the Holy Land,” answered Ah Sheng.</p>
<p>“Which dimensional zones?” Li Xuan was intrigued.</p>
<p>“The nearest place is in Qin Mountain. I don’t know what the name is,” Ah Sheng answered simply.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan’s expression changed when he heard the name. “Brother Sheng, don’t tell me you are really letting us enter the dimensional zone at Qin Mountain? I heard that the dimensional zones there are really terrifying. Without being at the Epic stage, entry means death.”</p>
<p>“It’s not that exaggerated. About 90% die,” Ah Sheng said.</p>
<p>Is there a difference? Li Xuan cursed inwardly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know much about this, so he asked, “Is Qin Mountain terrifying?”</p>
<p>“Is it terrifying? Remove that questioning tone and that’s more like it. That’s where the great horror lies. Have you heard of the legendary Kunlun?” Li Xuan said with a twitch of his lips.</p>
<p>“Didn’t Ah Sheng say he was going to Qin Mountain? What has it got to do with Kunlun?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>“The legendary Kunlun of ancient myths refers to Qin Mountain. It doesn’t point to the present-day Kunlun Mountain Range. Qin Mountain is also a dragon vein of East District, basically the best geographical location. The dimensional zones there are extremely terrifying, and there are countless powerful dimensional creatures inside. Humans are nothing there. Even top human experts have to tread carefully inside like they are treading on thin ice. If they aren’t careful, they might perish, much less us Legendaries.” Li Xuan asked another question after he was done, “Brother Sheng, are you really taking us to the dimensional zone in Qin Mountain?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Ah Sheng answered simply.</p>
<p>Li Xuan suddenly realized that coming with Zhou Wen was a wrong decision.</p>
<p>It didn’t mean that he was afraid of going to the ruins. No matter how dangerous that place was, Ah Sheng wouldn’t bring them to their deaths.</p>
<p>However, along the way, Ah Sheng drove without saying a word, while Zhou Wen gamed on his phone, leaving him bored out of his wits.</p>
<p>“Is that stupid game really that fun? You’ve been grinding ants the entire journey. How many ants have you killed? Did the ants provoke you? If you really hate it so much, just find a real ant and kill it. Why do you have to seek revenge on it?” Li Xuan said gloomily.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Zhou Wen replied before continuing grinding</p>
<p>Li Xuan was instantly rendered speechless. He had no way of communicating with Zhou Wen, so all he could do was lean back into his seat and sleep.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been trying to kill the Golden Flying Ant or break the white cocoon it was protecting. Unfortunately, the Golden Flying Ant was too fast, so he could do neither.</p>
<p>However, grinding for some Companion Eggs to feed his pets was not a bad choice. He could try his luck at Companion Beast fusion.</p>
<p>The success rate of a fusion was really low. The success rate for the first fusion was the highest. After every fusion, the success rate plummeted. As for how much it decreased, it depended on the pet’s species.</p>
<p>Due to the existence of the Grand Yin Wind skill, Zhou Wen could quickly grind ants. Many ant eggs dropped, so Zhou Wen began to wonder if he could come up with an ant that could both fly and provide defense.</p>
<p>It would have high speed and high defense.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen had been using Companion Eggs of the black-winged flying ants and the red-armored ants all this time. He had succeeded quite a few times, but none of them could satisfy Zhou Wen with their stats and skills.</p>
<p>Red-armored, yellow-armored, blue-armored ants each have a defensive Primordial Energy Skill. I’ll first do fusion until I get an ant with three skills, then I’ll combine it with a black-winged flying ant, allowing it to have the ability to fly. That way, I’ll need at least three fusions. The success rate is just too low. Zhou Wen tried many times. Skills were either lost after the fusion or the fusions failed.</p>
<p>It was especially so for the third fusion. The chances of success were too low. There was only a little more than an 11% chance of success. He had lost count of the number of times he had attempted fusion, but they all failed.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there were many ant eggs. Zhou Wen didn’t have anything else to do on the way, so he slowly fused them.</p>
<p>When the car entered the mountainous region, it was very rare to see people and cars.</p>
<p>In this era, due to the appearance of the dimensional zones, many roads were blocked. Traveling between cities was actually a very difficult matter.</p>
<p>If an ordinary person were to accidentally enter a dimensional zone, the probability of surviving was extremely low.</p>
<p>“Read latest chapters at Wuxiaworld.site</p>
<p>Currently, there weren’t many civilian operations for the transportation of goods. The main reason was that the League’s military was doing it. Even so, there were still many accidents every year.</p>
<p>Most of the time, people along with their vehicles would disappear. Search and rescue teams didn’t even have a clue where to begin.</p>
<p>As the car drove along the mountain road, Zhou Wen, who was gaming, suddenly felt his eardrums hurt. The window shattered at the same time as the tires burst. Accompanied by an explosive sound, he heard a strange shriek.</p>
<p>The car lost control and swerved into the railing of the mountain road as it began to spin off the road.</p>
<p>Ah Sheng suddenly wound down the car window, and with one foot on the mountain road, he forcefully stopped the car. It was as if the car had been nailed to the ground, leaving it less than a meter away from the cliff.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were given a fright as they subconsciously looked out onto the mountain road. They saw a golden glow dancing in the middle of the mountain range.</p>
<p>On a closer look, it was a giant bird that was as golden as a phoenix. It was dancing through the mountain like a golden sun. The bird’s cry from before came from it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter194'>Chapter 194 Car Flying Through The Empty Sky</h3>
<p>“F*ck, is that a phoenix?” Li Xuan asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“Don’t speak, don’t move, don’t make any sound,” Ah Sheng said in a low voice.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan felt a baffling sense of pressure when they saw Ah Sheng being so cautious. They sat in the car without daring to move, but their eyes were focused on the dancing giant bird in the mountains.</p>
<p>The giant bird flew very leisurely, like a golden cloud floating in the middle of a mountain. It leisurely bobbed up and down in the sky, like an elder taking a stroll.</p>
<p>After flying for a while, the giant bird approached Zhou Wen and company. Only then did Zhou Wen and Li Xuan see that behind the giant bird was a row of chicks.</p>
<p>The giant bird was like a golden cloud, but the chicks were about the size of a quail. Although their feathers were also golden, their color was lighter, and they didn’t have such a strong luster. Apparently, their feathers hadn’t fully grown.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen counted and found a total of six chicks followed behind the giant bird. They flapped their wings and tried their best to maintain their flying postures, but it was extremely strenuous. They flew in all directions, as though they could drop at any moment.</p>
<p>The giant bird ignored them and continued flying in front. The six chicks tried their best to follow the giant bird up and down as they flapped their wings with all their might.</p>
<p>This is the true descendant of a dimensional creature! This was the first time Zhou Wen had seen a dimensional creature’s descendant. A Companion Egg wasn’t a real egg, but a form of life crystal.</p>
<p>As they watched, the giant bird flew over with the chicks. When it was a few hundred meters away from the mountain path, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan felt a strong heat blast, as though a scorching wind was hitting them.</p>
<p>The sweat from their bodies intermediately oozed out. In a blink of an eye, their clothes were drenched.</p>
<p>Because of Ah Sheng’s reminder, neither of them dared make a sound. They sat in the car, as though they were in a sauna.</p>
<p>They were still somewhat worried, unsure if the giant bird was coming for them. Zhou Wen even wondered if their firm muscles had caught the fancy of the giant bird, making it decide to feed them to the chicks.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and Zhou Wen looked at Ah Sheng, hoping to ask him what ideas he had. They were no match for such a monstrous creature. If they didn’t flee now, it would be too late.</p>
<p>Ah Sheng sat there without any reaction. He looked at the giant bird without a word, evidently having no intention of escaping.</p>
<p>The two of them could only bite the bullet and sit still. After a while, the giant bird flew past the top of the mountain with the six chicks and ignored them. Clearly, they were only out practicing flying and weren’t intentionally targeting them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan secretly heaved a sigh of relief when they saw that the giant bird was about to fly over them.</p>
<p>However, it was at this moment that something unexpected happened.</p>
<p>An exhausted chick fell from the sky. Although it tried its best to flap its wings and control its body, it was unable to muster the required strength. It fell faster and faster.</p>
<p>And coincidentally, the chick fell in the direction of their car.</p>
<p>“What do we do?” Li Xuan and Zhou Wen looked at Ah Sheng.</p>
<p>Ah Sheng obviously hadn’t expected this to happen and the look on his face changed as well. However, he still sat motionlessly in the driver’s seat and even gestured for their silence.</p>
<p>The chick fell too quickly and just as Zhou Wen saw that Ah Sheng wasn’t moving, the chick had already fallen on the roof of the car. With a loud thud, a huge dent was produced on the roof.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a tiny hole had smashed through the roof. The chick’s head and neck drooped down from the tiny hole as it shook in front of Zhou Wen and Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Instantly, the air in the car seemed to freeze. Li Xuan robotically turned his head and exchanged a glance with Zhou Wen, seeing their worry in each other’s eyes.</p>
<p>This chick won’t die here, right? Zhou Wen was very worried. If the chick really died here, would the giant bird vent its anger on them?</p>
<p>Dimension creatures weren’t humans, so they wouldn’t reason with them. They could thank their lucky heavens if they weren’t eaten by them, much less think about being given compensation for the car damage.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was considering whether he should immediately jump out of the car to flee, he saw the chick’s neck twitch before opening its eyes. It then looked at Zhou Wen and Li Xuan for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Following that, they heard thumping sounds. The car’s roof which was made of special steel alloy had been warped and dented. There were a few more holes, as sharp objects pierced through the steel plate, allowing Zhou Wen and company to see tiny sharp hook-like talons.</p>
<p>Precisely six sounds! Zhou Wen kept count as he listened to the thumping and knew that six chicks had landed on their roof.</p>
<p>In the next second, before the sound could form an image in Zhou Wen’s mind, the car trembled violently. Outside the shattered car window, a gigantic golden bird claw appeared.</p>
<p>Then, Zhou Wen and company felt the car rapidly rise as it instantly rose into the sky.</p>
<p>How can I be so unlucky… Zhou Wen felt that he never had a smooth trip when he went out. This time, he was ridiculously unlucky.</p>
<p>Li Xuan could no longer hold his tongue, but Ah Sheng made a gesture a step ahead of him, indicating for him to remain silent and continue sitting</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan could already look down on the mountain. The entire car had been hoisted into the sky by the giant bird’s claw.</p>
<p>The chick exchanged looks with the humans for a few seconds before struggling a few times to pull its head out.</p>
<p>But soon, Zhou Wen heard the piercing sound of steel being torn through. The roof of the car was quickly ripped off by a tiny talon, forming a bigger hole. The chick jumped in</p>
<p>Seeing the chick about to land on him, Zhou Wen thought of the tiny, tender talon that could easily tear apart special steel plates. This gave him the urge to rush from the vehicle to flee.</p>
<p>Ah Sheng, who was in front, gestured for him to hold back. Clearly, he didn’t want Zhou Wen to make any sudden movements.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hesitated for a moment before the chick landed on his leg. Unlike what he imagined, the chick was very light and was at most half a pound in weight. It didn’t have any strength in its claws.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could decide on how to deal with the chick, a few more chicks had jumped down from the hole and landed on Zhou Wen and Li Xuan, or into the back row of seats.</p>
<p>Another chick landed on Li Xuan’s head and stood perched there, as though it had no intention of moving.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and Zhou Wen were equally depressed, but they didn’t dare move. They had the urge to cry.</p>
<p>The six chicks jumped around Zhou Wen and company and pecked them from time to time. However, they didn’t really exert any strength, as though they were just curious.</p>
<p>It’s over, it’s over. If this giant bird were to bring us back, we would definitely become their meal. Li Xuan lamented inwardly about his bad luck.</p>
<h3 id='chapter195'>Chapter 195 Tree Halfway Up the Mountain</h3>
<p>The six chicks happily bounced around in the car. They pecked here and there, looking around with curiosity.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan clearly weren’t as relaxed as they were. They sat there motionless, afraid that they would anger them and incur the giant bird’s wrath.</p>
<p>At the same time, they were afraid that these chicks would suddenly think of trying to test the hardness of their beaks.</p>
<p>“Bam!” Just as they were in thought, a chick suddenly threw a tantrum and pecked heavily at the car door.</p>
<p>The car was bulletproof. A normal bomb couldn’t even blast open the door, but the chick easily bore through a hole.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan’s cold sweat instantly poured, mixing with the warm sweat that they were already soaked in. It was quite an indescribable feeling.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the chicks didn’t try their beaks on them. Zhou Wen was fine, but Li Xuan was a little unlucky. The chick that was standing above him actually pooped. Although it wasn’t much, it made Li Xuan feel like dying.</p>
<p>With another loud crash, the car shook violently. The golden bird’s giant claw had vanished, and the car had apparently landed on the ground.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen looked outside, he immediately realized that he was wrong. They hadn’t landed on the ground at all. This was a mountain halfway up the mountain. The car had landed on a stone platform on the mountainside. It was neither up nor down. Unless their car could fly, it was impossible to drive away.</p>
<p>Being able to drive away was secondary. Most importantly, it was whether they could return alive.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was considering how to survive when Li Xuan furtively tugged at the corner of his shirt and pointed outside the window.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked in the direction he was pointing and was immediately alarmed.</p>
<p>They were on the mountainside of a lone mountain peak, at least 700 to 800 meters off the ground. However, from Li Xuan’s side, he could see the crown of a tree.</p>
<p>A tree crown can be seen here? How tall is that tree? Zhou Wen found it unimaginable. Although there were many mutated plants in this era, Zhou Wen had never seen a tree that was 700-800 meters tall.</p>
<p>If the height was converted into a building, it would be about 200 to 300 stories tall.</p>
<p>The phoenix-like bird landed on the crown of the tree and let out a bird’s cry. It made Zhou Wen feel like his ears were numb, buzzing so much that he couldn’t hear anything.</p>
<p>When the six chicks heard the giant bird’s cry, they bounced out of the window and approached the giant bird on the tree crown.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen realize that the huge bird didn’t live on the mountain peak. Its nest was on the large tree.</p>
<p>On the mountain’s stone platform, besides their car, there were also several other cars. There were SUVs and trucks too, and many things were scattered around them.</p>
<p>There was a box of beverages, as well as some timber from a vehicle. All sorts of things were scattered on the platform, but no one could be seen.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it’s not the first time that the giant bird has brought cars up here, but why isn’t there anyone around? Where did the people in those cars go? Did they escape or have they already found themselves in the giant bird’s stomach? Zhou Wen guessed.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was contemplating, the giant bird had already led the six chicks into a tree hole. At that moment, Ah Sheng lowered his voice and said, “That giant bird is too terrifying. We are no match for it, so make sure not to anger it.”</p>
<p>“Brother Sheng, there are Epic creatures you can’t deal with?” Li Xuan asked with a sliver of hope.</p>
<p>“I may have means to deal with an Epic creature, but it’s hard to tell whether that’s an Epic creature or not,” Ah Sheng said calmly.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was immediately alarmed when he heard that. “That can’t be? Could it really be the mythical phoenix?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if it’s a phoenix, but that tree should be the legendary parasol tree,” Ah Sheng said as he looked at the giant tree outside.</p>
<p>“The tree outside is the parasol tree? There’s the saying that a phoenix nests in a parasol tree. Does that mean that the giant bird is really a phoenix?” Li Xuan was even more alarmed.</p>
<p>“That’s not necessarily the case. I once fought in the dimensional zones with the Overseer and have previously seen parasol trees slightly smaller than this one elsewhere. It was an Azure Luan which was just half a step short of being a Mythical creature. We suffered heavy losses in that battle and even the Overseer suffered serious injuries. That’s why we killed the Azure Luan and chopped down the parasol tree,” Ah Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Brother Sheng, what should we do now? Why don’t we sneak down the mountain and escape at night?” Upon hearing Ah Sheng’s words, Li Xuan felt even more afraid.</p>
<p>“Forget about these terrifying dimensional creatures. Even ordinary birds have better eyesight than humans. Daytime or nighttime doesn’t make a difference to them.” Ah Sheng scanned his surroundings and saw the cars and the things strewn on the ground.</p>
<p>“You guys wait here. I’ll go out and take a look.” Ah Sheng then quietly got out of the car. He crawled forward like a snake, so quiet that he didn’t even make a sound.</p>
<p>In a short while, Ah Sheng returned with many things tucked under his arms.</p>
<p>“These drinks still have half a year of shelf life. From the looks of it, their owners weren’t brought here too long ago. Now, there’s no one here. If they haven’t escaped, they are most likely in the giant bird’s stomach.” Ah Sheng handed the cans in his hand to Zhou Wen and Li Xuan. “Only after eating will we have the strength to flee. We don’t have much time left. There are still a few dimensional zones to go. We also need to arrive in the Holy Land on time. We can’t delay any further.”</p>
<p>Considering how the giant bird wasn’t likely to exit the tree hole moments after returning, they decided to leave immediately.</p>
<p>After drinking some of the beverages and eating some snacks to fill their stomachs, the three of them immediately got up and quietly headed for the edge of the cliff to take a look.</p>
<p>ot only was the mountain steep, but the stone wall was also as smooth as a mirror. There was almost no place to rest one’s feet.</p>
<p>“It’s too steep here. If I don’t use my flying pets, I’m afraid I won’t be able to get down,” Li Xuan said with a sullen expression.</p>
<p>“You can’t use Companion Beasts. Dimension creatures are very territorial. If you use a Companion Beast, you will be making an enemy out of the giant bird, infuriating it in the process.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, can you go down by yourself?” Ah Sheng asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Yes.” It wasn’t difficult for Zhou Wen to head down.</p>
<p>“Alright, then I’ll carry Li Xuan. Let’s head down together.” After Ah Sheng said that, he crouched down and waited for Li Xuan to get on his back.</p>
<p>“Brother Sheng, there’s no need. There’s really no need. I should be able to give it a try myself. There won’t be much of a problem.” Li Xuan hurriedly rejected Ah Sheng’s good intentions.</p>
<p>The three of them climbed down together. Their ascension of the mountain was abrupt, but their descent was dangerous. With Dragon Gate Fairy Skill, Zhou Wen was barely able to maintain his balance while descending</p>
<p>Zhou Wen crawled for a while and saw Li Xuan sweating profusely. However, it seemed as though he could still hang on.</p>
<p>He subconsciously turned his head to look in the direction of the tree hole. What he saw left Zhou Wen in a state of shock. He had no idea that the giant bird was standing at the tree hole’s entrance. Its eyes were coldly staring at him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter196'>Chapter 196 Four Gentlemen Blades</h3>
<p>Ah Sheng and Li Xuan had clearly noticed it as well. They lay on the mountain wall, not daring to move.</p>
<p>The giant bird spread its wings before violently flapping them once. An ominous foreboding rose in their minds when they felt a hurricane rise up and sweep their bodies up.</p>
<p>Bam! Bam! Bam!</p>
<p>The three of them fell back onto the stone platform and saw stars. It took them a while before they could stand up.</p>
<p>However, when they turned back to look at the tree hole in the towering tree, there was no sign of the giant bird. Looking everywhere, there was no trace of it. It was as though it had gone back inside.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, it knew we were here long ago. Since it didn’t kill us, why did it leave us here? Could it be that it treats us as a food stockpile and plans to keep us here for the new year?” Li Xuan was still in the mood to joke.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if it’s keeping us for the new year, but it must have deliberately left us here,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Since it didn’t kill us, we still have a chance. Let’s think of other ways.” Ah Sheng said as he looked around the platform.</p>
<p>Since the giant bird had already targeted them, it was useless no matter how careful they were. Zhou Wen also circled the platform, hoping to find something useful.</p>
<p>“This item isn’t bad.” Li Xuan found a playboy magazine in a cargo truck’s compartment.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen picked up a beverage bottle and saw that there was still more than a month left before it expired. He opened it to drink it and, as he did so, he arrived in front of an off-road vehicle. The off-road vehicle looked very old and had all its windows shattered. The frame was also severely deformed.</p>
<p>The vehicle’s body was covered in mud, and it was about the same inside. It looked like it had suffered the elements and had been here for quite some time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked inside and saw a plush doll covered in mud sitting in the back seat. He thought, The owner of this vehicle likely had a child on board. I wonder how they ended up. I hope they’re alright.</p>
<p>There was too much mud in the vehicle, so it didn’t seem to have anything of use. Just as Zhou Wen was about to turn around and leave, he suddenly caught sight of a pole-like item caked in mud.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his hand and pulled the item out.</p>
<p>It’s really a saber. Zhou Wen wiped the mud away and revealed the true appearance of the object. It was a sheathed saber.</p>
<p>The saber was straight, so its scabbard was also straight. Together with the hilt, it looked like a four-foot-long stick.</p>
<p>After wiping it clean, he realized that the entire saber’s design was like a piece of bamboo-segmented. The top segment was the hilt, and the bottom four segments were the scabbard. If one looked closely, one would think that it was a bamboo stick.</p>
<p>In fact, the hilt and scabbard were made of metal, and it weighed heavily in the hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen attempted to draw the blade but failed to pull it out.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, what are you doing?” Li Xuan ran over and stared at the bamboo blade in Zhou Wen’s hand.</p>
<p>“I found a saber, but I can’t pull it out.” Zhou Wen tried several times but failed to pull it out. He couldn’t help but be surprised.</p>
<p>He was very strong and could easily break steel bars. He was rather surprised that he couldn’t pull out the bamboo blade.</p>
<p>“It looks like a bamboo stick no matter how you look at it. How is it a blade?” Li Xuan commented as he looked at the bamboo blade in Zhou Wen’s hand.</p>
<p>“No, that’s a saber. Its name is Bamboo Blade.” Ah Sheng heard their conversation and walked over, only to see it. He asked in surprise, “Where did you find this Bamboo Blade?”</p>
<p>“It was inside this car.” Zhou Wen pointed at the off-road vehicle and said, “I wonder if it’s stuck from rust. I can’t pull out the blade.”</p>
<p>As Ah Sheng got into the off-road vehicle, he searched and said, “The Bamboo Blade is made of Primordial Gold. Even the scabbard doesn’t rust, much less the blade. This blade has a special design. You need to spin it counterclockwise to pull the blade out.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed Ah Sheng’s instructions and turned the handle. Although it was very heavy, it could really be rotated. When he exerted his force outwards, a portion of the blade immediately came out of the scabbard.</p>
<p>The blade was like a deep pool of water that emitted a coldness. It was only two fingers wide and the back of the blade was slightly wider. Its sharp edge was extremely thin, making it feel like it could easily slice through anything.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pulled the blade out and swung it around. When the blade brushed past the car window to his side, it was sliced apart cleanly. Zhou Wen didn’t sense any resistance from the blade’s edge, showcasing its shocking sharpness.</p>
<p>“This blade is so sharp! Furthermore, it’s made of Primordial Gold. Are there any left? Find one for me too.” Li Xuan was also shocked by the sharpness of the Bamboo Blade.</p>
<p>“There’s only one Bamboo Blade in the entire League. Where are you going to find another one?” Ah Sheng crawled out from the off-road vehicle empty-handed. Clearly, he hadn’t found anything.</p>
<p>“Are you serious? The An family has plenty of Primordial Gold ores. Isn’t it easy to make one?” Li Xuan said in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Primordial Gold ores are restricted items. Every gram has a record. The League is very strict regarding this, so it’s impossible for the An family to use them as they wish. Besides, this blade wasn’t forged by the An family,” Ah Sheng said as he looked at the Bamboo Blade in Zhou Wen’s hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen handed the Bamboo Blade to Ah Sheng and, after he took a careful look at the blade, Ah Sheng said, “The blade is like a pool of water over an abyss. Deep beneath is nothing but blood. This is indeed the Bamboo Blade of the Four Gentlemen Blades. I never expected that the Bamboo Blade that has been missing for so many years would actually be here.”</p>
<p>“What are the Four Gentlemen Blades? Why haven’t I ever heard of them before?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>Ah Sheng didn’t answer Li Xuan. He gently swiped the blade across his palm and immediately sliced open a bloody gash. Blood trickled down the blade, forming a line that remained coagulated without dripping.</p>
<p>“Brother Sheng, what are you doing?” Li Xuan and Zhou Wen looked at Ah Sheng in a daze.</p>
<p>“A gentleman doesn’t fight, but if there’s a need to fight, blood will definitely splatter. Hence, when the Four Gentlemen Blades are unsheathed, blood must be seen. Otherwise, it will deal harm to their masters.” As Ah Sheng spoke, he swung the blade and threw blood on the blade out. The blade was spotless, like a pool of limpid water.</p>
<p>After sheathing the blade, Ah Sheng returned it to Zhou Wen. “Young Master Wen, although this blade is sharp, it’s very inauspicious. It’s best you don’t use it if possible.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded and took the Bamboo Blade. He asked, “Who’s the owner of this blade? Will someone come looking for me in the future?”</p>
<p>Ah Sheng shook his head and said, “The person who used the blade has been dead for years. The four original owners of the Plum, Orchid, Bamboo, and Chrysanthemum Blades all died tragically. Later on, when these four blades found themselves outside in the world, they gradually vanished. Their subsequent masters probably didn’t have a good ending.”</p>
<p>“What era are we in now? Why do we still believe in such superstitions? Aren’t you a fool to not use such a good blade?” Li Xuan said disapprovingly.</p>
<p>Ah Sheng didn’t argue with him and said, “The Overseer’s father, Old Master An, was once the owner of the Plum Blade.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, Li Xuan immediately fell silent. An Tianzuo’s father, Ouyang Lan’s ex-husband, was once the head of the An family with a promising future. Despite his bright future, he died early due to an accident. It was regretful and was known by all the rich and powerful in Luoyang. Li Xuan naturally knew.</p>
<p>If this was really the inauspiciousness brought about by the Four Gentlemen Blades, it was really terrifying.</p>
<h3 id='chapter197'>Chapter 197 Trainer</h3>
<p>“The owner of this blade might be like uscaught and brought here by the giant bird. There’s a high chance that they were eaten by that giant bird. From the looks of it, this blade is truly inauspicious. Zhou Wen, it’s best you throw it away,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>However, Ah Sheng said, “Once the blade is in hand, you’re its owner. It’s too late to throw it away now. You should bring it along.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded without a word. He wasn’t superstitious to begin with, so he naturally didn’t mind.</p>
<p>The trio searched the platform for a while longer before finding two Companion Eggs in the trunk of a car. However, they were only at the Legendary stage and didn’t look like they were worth much.</p>
<p>Realizing that the giant bird hadn’t appeared the entire time, the trio decided to secretly escape from another side, but before they could go far, they felt a hot gust of wind assault them. They were once again swept back onto the platform. This time, they didn’t even see the giant bird.</p>
<p>After that, they made a few more attempts and even tried to escape by jumping down the mountain. However, the result was the same. The hot gust of wind blew them back onto the platform.</p>
<p>The next morning, before the sun rose above the horizon, the giant bird brought six chicks out of the tree hole and led them to the mountaintop.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company originally imagined that they would fly away like before, but to their surprise, the giant bird only brought the six chicks to the mountaintop. Then, they formed a line before jumping off the mountain peak like diving athletes. As they learned how to fly, they charged towards the platform.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw a chick charging towards him and was about to dodge to the side when he felt a force overwhelming him. It impelled him to meet the chick and catch it.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen and company knew the intentions of the giant bird. It had actually treated Zhou Wen and company as workers. They were to catch its six children while they practiced flying swoops.</p>
<p>A day ago, Zhou Wen never imagined that he would be a nanny and trainer of six chicks.</p>
<p>What left Zhou Wen even more depressed was that the birds seemed to always target him and fly towards him. They seldom flew towards Ah Sheng and Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Li Xuan gloated by the side and said, “Old Zhou, it looks like you have quite good social relations, no-maybe I should say you have better twitter relations! Those chicks love you. If you were this good with women, you would have long been in a relationship.”</p>
<p>The chicks practiced flying the entire day. These fellows had extremely strong physiques and talent, but as they had just been born, they were unable to perfectly control their bodies. That was why they appeared rather clumsy.</p>
<p>However, they improved extremely quickly. With just a day’s practice, their body control had increased tremendously. In the morning, they were still staggering in flight. Not only did they not land on Zhou Wen, they even missed and flew past the stone platform.</p>
<p>By the evening, the chicks could accurately land on Zhou Wen’s head.</p>
<p>When the sun set, the giant bird returned to the tree hole with the chicks. Zhou Wen believed that he could finally relax, but to his surprise, the giant bird flapped its wing, stirring up a gust of wind that pulled him into the tree hole.</p>
<p>Ah Sheng’s reaction was extremely fast as he grabbed Zhou Wen, but with his strength, he couldn’t hold him back. His feet drew two long ditches on the stone platform and he was almost thrown off the stone platform.</p>
<p>“This bird sure is sinister. It made us nannies in the day, and food at night.” Li Xuan also pounced forward to grab Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, it was useless. The giant bird’s wings flapped once again as the three of them were sent flying into the hole.</p>
<p>“It’s over, it’s over. We’ll definitely be food for the birds this time!” Li Xuan cried out tragically.</p>
<p>The tree hole was very deep. When Zhou Wen and company landed on the ground, they felt the force retract, preventing them from slamming heavily to the ground.</p>
<p>“Stop shouting. These birds don’t eat meat,” Ah Sheng looked around and said.</p>
<p>“How do you know they don’t eat meat?” Li Xuan refused to believe it.</p>
<p>“There’s no smell of blood here, nor are there any bones or anything like that. Instead, there are a lot of fruits here.” Ah Sheng pointed to a corner of the tree hole. There were indeed many fruits piled there.</p>
<p>“So they don’t eat meat. That’s good, that’s good.” Li Xuan heaved a long sigh of relief.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t look at the fruits. He raised his head and looked up with a strange expression.</p>
<p>The tree hole was nearly a hundred meters tall, like a huge warehouse. In the sky of the tree hole, floated a golden oval object.</p>
<p>If one looked closely, one would realize that it was a cocoon made of silk.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen two similar cocoons, but they were white while this one above him was golden.</p>
<p>That can’t be. There’s actually a cocoon here? Zhou Wen carefully looked at the golden cocoon. The more he looked at it, the more it looked like the two cocoons he had seen apart from the different color.</p>
<p>Could it be that these dimensional creatures are actually born out of cocoons? Zhou Wen found it odd. Why did these different dimensional creatures have a cocoon in their nests?</p>
<p>Up to this point, only Golden Flying Ant was the weakest of dimensional creatures with cocoons. The other two were ridiculously strong.</p>
<p>There was no need to mention the dragon-shaped creature wrapped around the stone pillar in Dragon’s Well. It was unimaginable. Likewise for this giant bird. Ah Sheng was also one of the top experts in the Epic stage; yet, he did not seem to have much ability to resist the giant bird.</p>
<p>Of course, it was also possible that Ah Sheng wasn’t planning on giving his all unless death was certain.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and Ah Sheng followed Zhou Wen’s gaze and saw the golden cocoon. Li Xuan exclaimed in surprise, “Strange, why is there a cocoon here?”</p>
<p>No one could answer him as the giant bird landed with six chicks. This sight made Li Xuan’s heart tighten, and he was in no mood to care what the cocoon was.</p>
<p>The giant bird landed on a charred piece of wood and squawked at Zhou Wen and company, causing their eardrums to ring.</p>
<p>The trio didn’t understand bird language, nor did they have telepathic abilities. They didn’t know what the giant bird meant, but just as they were hesitating, they saw that each of the six chicks had something in their mouths. They flapped their wings and flew diagonally to Zhou Wen, placing the things in their mouths at his feet.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally believed that these chicks were afraid that their trainer would starve to death, so they brought him fruits to eat. But upon closer inspection, he realized that the six chicks didn’t bring fruit, but instead, they were shards that resembled jade.</p>
<p>The six shards were all different shapes, but the material looked about the same. It was a translucent jade that was close to beige in color.</p>
<p>Why are you giving me this? I’m not a Western dragon or a woman. I don’t like shiny things. I’d rather receive fruits, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<h3 id='chapter198'>Chapter 198 Shard Choice</h3>
<p>“These look like eggshell shards.” Ah Sheng carefully examined the shards and said after a moment of thought.</p>
<p>“Eggshell shards?” Zhou Wen carefully inspected the six shards and indeed, they looked like irregular shapes after an eggshell cracked.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the shards all had some curvature, making Zhou Wen even more certain that Ah Sheng was right. These shards were likely the eggshells of the six chicks.</p>
<p>But why are they bringing me their eggshells? Can it be that they want to treat me to eggshells? I can eat bird eggs, but I can’t eat eggshells. Zhou Wen felt depressed. Ignoring the fact that they couldn’t understand him, he coughed lightly and said to them, “Thank you for your kind intentions. I don’t eat eggshells. You should put them away.”</p>
<p>It was unknown if they didn’t understand him or if there were other reasons. The six chicks stood in front of Zhou Wen in a line as they stared at him with widened eyes, as though they hadn’t heard him.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw that they weren’t moving, he knew that he couldn’t continue the standstill. Hence, he picked up an eggshell and said, “I just need one piece. I’ll take it back and slowly eat it.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pinched the eggshell and found it smooth and supple. It was warm to the touch and resembled legendary warm jade. If he hadn’t seen these chicks before, no one would have expected it to be an eggshell shard.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen spoke, he placed the shard in his pocket, hoping that he would be able to bluff his way through.</p>
<p>He never expected things to work out. Upon seeing Zhou Wen grab a shard, the other five chicks ran back with their respective shards in their mouths. Only the chick that Zhou Wen had taken a shard from stood in its original spot as it stared blankly at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen finally heaved a sigh of relief. If the chicks were determined to make him eat the eggshell, Zhou Wen would have to make a last stand in battle despite knowing that he was no match for them. He really couldn’t swallow something like that.</p>
<p>I wonder what other tricks these chicks have up their sleeves? Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over the matter, he saw the giant bird perched on a piece of charred wood. It spread its wings and, immediately, a hot wind swept the three of them up like a tornado, throwing them out of the tree hole.</p>
<p>The trio felt as though they were riding on floating clouds, and their vision was filled with distorted golden light. When the terrifying power disappeared, they fell to the ground and realized that there was no parasol tree in front of them. Instead, they were on a mountain path. There were also collision signs along the mountain railings-it was where they had stopped their car earlier.</p>
<p>Li Xuan looked around but did not see any sign of the giant bird. He could not help but exclaim in pleasant surprise, “We have returned to our original spot. Did that giant bird actually released us?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also delighted, but when he suddenly heard a bird’s cry, he couldn’t help but feel his heart turn cold. He imagined that the giant bird was here again, but on careful thought, he felt that something was amiss. The bird’s cry was clearly very tender and lacked a terrifying might. It wasn’t the giant bird’s cry, but more like a chick’s.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked down and saw a chick standing by his feet in a daze. It was looking at him with its head cocked.</p>
<p>Why was this chick swept away with us? Zhou Wen was alarmed, but on second thought, he felt that this might not be a mistake made by the giant bird.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already found it odd that the six chicks had brought him shards. Back then, he hadn’t thought too much about it, but he had a lot more thoughts once he saw the chick had also been sent away with him.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me I was choosing these chicks back when I took the shard? The chick I chose will leave with me? If that’s the case, what would happen if I had taken all six of them? Zhou Wen reached out to pick up the chick which didn’t resist. It allowed Zhou Wen to hold it in his hand as it cocked its head and stared at Zhou Wen with its round eyes.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, did the giant bird give this chick to you? That’s not fair. We did the work together, so why is it that only you received a present, while Brother Sheng and I have nothing?” Li Xuan also noticed the crux of the problem.</p>
<p>“I still don’t know if it’s a blessing or a calamity.” Zhou Wen shook his head slightly and shouted towards the mountain range with the chick in hand, “Divine bird, are you letting me take it away?”</p>
<p>After shouting three times without receiving any response, Zhou Wen had no choice but to take the chick along with him.</p>
<p>Without a car, the trio could only walk on foot. Although they could run as fast as cars, a human wasn’t a machine. With limited stamina, they would be drained of their strength if they ran for a long time.</p>
<p>And in the wilderness of the mountainous region, with them near Qin Mountain, they would be in for a bad time if they encountered dimensional creatures while lacking strength.</p>
<p>The trio didn’t dare to run too fast either. They alternated between walking and running</p>
<p>Originally, Ah Sheng had planned on taking them to a dimensional zone near Qin Mountain, but because of a lack of vehicle and no phone signal here, he had no choice but to abandon his previous plans and rush to the next city as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Ah Sheng told Zhou Wen that if they didn’t arrive at the next city in time, the An family would send a search and rescue team to seek them out. Therefore, they had to come into contact with the An family as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Qin Mountain was just too mysterious. Although they were only close to it and had yet to really enter it, they had already seen many mysterious objects.</p>
<p>That night, Zhou Wen and company heard the sound of immortal music coming from Qin Mountain. It sounded like fairies were playing music and dancing inside.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen wished to take a look, he knew that he couldn’t take the risk.</p>
<p>Along the way, he saw many plants that he had never seen before—mushrooms that were taller than buildings, grass that resembled humans. There were all sorts of strange things happening. And this was only the periphery of Qin Mountain.</p>
<p>Although they encountered many strange incidents along the way, nothing serious happened after encountering the giant bird. The three of them finally traversed Qin Mountain and arrived at a small city.</p>
<p>Ah Sheng contacted the An family and gave them a timely update of the situation, stopping the search and rescue team that the An family had already prepared to send.</p>
<p>“Our original plan was to let you first head to a few dimensional zones to train, but it’s too late now. We’ve already chartered a plane, and it will be taking us to the Holy Land in a while,” Ah Sheng said to Zhou Wen and Li Xuan after the call ended.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan felt that it was better to head directly to the Holy Land, to prevent themselves from encountering further troubles. After realizing the terror of the giant bird, they didn’t dare to casually wander about in the wilderness.</p>
<p>After resting for half a day, an armed helicopter came to pick them up and took them to a large city with an airport. Then, they flew to the Holy City.</p>
<p>As many regions in the sky were enveloped by dimensional zones, planes couldn’t fly randomly. Most of the air routes they had used in the past were no longer usable. Very few regions allowed passage. Now, the airports had been taken over by the League government, and the members of the aircrew were military officers.</p>
<h3 id='chapter199'>Chapter 199 Holy City</h3>
<p>Holy City was the highest administrative center of the League. It was also the world center that humanity had built after the dimensional storms.</p>
<p>The reason it was named Holy City was that the Six League Heroes had obtained their powerful physiques in Holy Land. With immense power, they had been able to suppress the generation of those times and establish a fixed political system, reducing the suffering that war and disaster brought to humanity.</p>
<p>The trio arrived at Holy City, a new city that was only built after the dimensional storms. The architectural style was different from the old cities like Guide City and Luoyang. It looked modern and there were statues of six heroes everywhere on the streets.</p>
<p>As heroes who saved humanity from the chaos and disaster, they had received the highest honor in the League. All the citizens of the League remembered their names forever.</p>
<p>However, this wasn’t a good thing for Zhou Wen because the descendants of the six heroes were likely to go against him.</p>
<p>Ignoring the grudges between An Tianzuo and the six hero families, just the grudge between Zhou Wen and the Capim family was unlikely to be resolved so easily.</p>
<p>Ah Sheng had booked a room for Zhou Wen and Li Xuan to stay in. After he settled them in, he began handling the administrative matters needed for entering the Holy Land.</p>
<p>As they had been delayed at Qin Mountain for a few days, most of the youths participating in the competition had already arrived. Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were considered the last two.</p>
<p>“Minister, Zhou Wen has arrived in Holy City and has checked into Goth Hotel.” Liz’s eyes shimmered as she clenched her fists tightly.</p>
<p>Liz could still endure having her Primordial Energy Sea crippled, but John’s humiliation made her wish she could immediately charge over and kill Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I already know. With An Sheng by his side, and with them being the League’s invitees at the Holy Land, it’s not appropriate for us to take Zhou Wen into custody so brazenly. Just as we said, contact the youths from the other families who will be participating in the competition and get them to take care of Zhou Wen inside the Holy Land,” Qiao Siyuan said.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Minister. Even if I don’t do it, the other families won’t let Zhou Wen off easily. Back then, An Tianzuo crippled six hero families’ generation of youths, and now with Zhou Wen representing the An family, everyone is rubbing their hands in glee. They want to cripple him just like what An Tianzuo did back then,” Liz said.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen isn’t a simple person. He was able to defeat John despite him using Light of Judgment. With such strength, not many people, including those from the six hero families, would be able to do it. Besides, the An family naturally has some confidence if they dare send him here. It’s best you contact the other families to ensure that nothing goes wrong with this plan.” Qiao Siyuan wasn’t as optimistic as Liz.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’ve already contacted a few people who are closer to my family to take action with John. There won’t be any problems,” Liz said confidently. “This is the Holy Land, not the An family’s Luoyang. Zhou Wen won’t be able to escape this time.”</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan tilted his head and paused before asking, “Have you contacted Lance?”</p>
<p>“No, he has been missing recently. I don’t know where he’s gone. I’m afraid he will not return until the day the Holy Land opens,” Liz said.</p>
<p>“Try your best to contact him. If Lance were to take action, everything would be fine,” Qiao Siyuan said.</p>
<p>With this being his first time in Holy City, Li Xuan went out shopping. He said that he wanted to see how different Holy City was from Luoyang. However, Zhou Wen wasn’t interested and chose to game in his room.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had used his phone’s camera function to look at the Bamboo Blade and the eggshell shard, but he had failed to discover anything special. Since he couldn’t lock onto the two items, he naturally couldn’t bring them in-game.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to place them in the Chaos Bead’s space. Zhou Wen had originally planned on using the power of the Chaos Bead to raise the First Order of Chaos to the Legendary stage to see what Life Providence he would obtain.</p>
<p>However, the Chaos Bead did not produce any light or text. Zhou Wen had no way of advancing himself.</p>
<p>The chick kept hopping on the table. Zhou Wen had bought some fruits for it, but it didn’t eat much.</p>
<p>Over the past few days, the chick didn’t eat much nor did it drink much water. However, it still looked energetic without showing any signs of frailty.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally planned on grinding a few instance dungeons to see if he could raise all his stats to 20, but the chick didn’t sit still. It jumped onto him and kept peeping noisily.</p>
<p>When he ignored it, it jumped onto his head and pecked him on the head with its beak.</p>
<p>“What are you trying to do?” Zhou Wen removed the chick from his head and questioned it gloomily.</p>
<p>Initially, he thought that it was pointless speaking to it since it wouldn’t be able to understand him. To his surprise, the chick actually understood him and jumped onto the table. Using its mouth, it flipped open a magazine to one of the pages, pressing its claw onto it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked curiously and saw that the chick’s claw was pressing down on an advertisement. The advertisement’s content was actually the auctioning of a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>“You want to eat this?” Zhou Wen asked the chick in shock.</p>
<p>The chick understood his words and immediately nodded.</p>
<p>“I don’t have that, but I do have a Legendary Companion Egg. Make do with it.” Zhou Wen took out a Legendary Companion Egg and placed it in front of the chick. It was something he had discovered in a damaged car on the stone platform.</p>
<p>Seeing the chick’s look of contempt, Zhou Wen added, “That is a rare Epic Companion Egg. I don’t have the money to buy it for you. Don’t even think about it. Just make do with this one. If you don’t eat it, you won’t even have one.”</p>
<p>Seeing the number of zeros on the starting bid, Zhou Wen lost all interest. Even he didn’t need such a good Companion Beast, so it was a little too much to let the chick eat it.</p>
<p>The chick glared at Zhou Wen before eventually lowering its head in resignation and pecked at the Companion Egg. It sporadically pecked at it, as though it was very unwilling to eat.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice. To feed it with a Legendary Companion Egg already pained his heart. It was impossible for him to obtain an Epic stage Companion Egg.</p>
<p>After resting for two days, Ah Sheng took them to the entrance of the Holy Land for registration. When they arrived, many young people had already finished registering.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen went to register, the official in charge of confirming the candidate read out ‘Luoyang An family’. This drew the gazes of all the youths present. A few of them even began cracking their knuckles.</p>
<p>Standing in the crowd, John stared coldly at Zhou Wen as the killing intent flickered in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, it looks like we are very popular.” Li Xuan also noticed that something was amiss, but he deliberately retorted.</p>
