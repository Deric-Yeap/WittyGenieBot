<h3 id='chapter900'>Chapter 900: Mirror Eyes</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>As the blood was absorbed, the Demon God Catalog in his body circulated crazily. His essence, vitality, and spirit also circulated with the Demon God Catalog.</p>
<p>Essence, vitality, and spirit gradually gathered together, but they didn’t form an independent Life Soul. Instead, they fused into Zhou Wen’s eyes, making them gradually become crystal-clear.</p>
<p>This transparency was abnormal. Before long, Zhou Wen’s eyes turned into what Torch Dragon looked like when it activated the Bright Torch Vision World. They were like two eye-shaped mirrors.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen’s eyes completely turned into mirrors, his Life Soul was finally condensed. Zhou Wen blinked and his eyes returned to normal.</p>
<p>However, when he activated the Demon God Catalog, his eyes turned into mirrors again. From afar, he looked like a blind person without pupils.</p>
<p>Could it be that the Demon God Catalog’s ability is similar to Torch Dragon’s? Zhou Wen found it odd, but he didn’t dare look at his phone here.</p>
<p>However, regardless of what Life Soul it was, the Demon God Catalog’s ability to condense a Life Soul was enough for Zhou Wen. This Essence Energy Art was most likely used to strengthen his Constitution. It wouldn’t overlap with the Qi Refinement Art, so the eight Essence Energy Arts was likely complete.</p>
<p>“The Thearch, I’ll head back now. I’ll come back in a month.” Zhou Wen left Chess Mountain with Ya’er, but he was still thinking, Is The Thearch really Nine-Tailed Fox? Why do I feel that it’s unlikely to be the case?</p>
<p>After returning to school, Zhou Wen dared to take out his phone to look at the information on his new Life Soul.</p>
<p>Life Soul: Mirror Eyes (Primordial Body)</p>
<p>The Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra that enhances Constitution also had an eye as a Life Soul, but it was a third eye. This Mirror Eyes overlaps with my eyes. I wonder what use it has. Zhou Wen switched on his phone, hoping to give it a try in-game to see if it had an ability similar to Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen was disappointed. He used the Mirror Eyes to look at the dimensional creatures, but it was useless. It didn’t produce the effects of Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>Not only was there no vision, there was no light emitted at all. When he used the Mirror Eyes to look at things, it was no different from ordinary eyes.</p>
<p>It didn’t have the ability of vision, lethality, petrification, or charm. Zhou Wen tried all the visual abilities he could think of, but they were useless. It was as though his Life Soul didn’t exist.</p>
<p>What’s the use of this Life Soul? Could it be an ability that reflects the eyes? Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he went to Medusa’s Curse Demon Palace.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t kill Medusa. Instead, he used his eyes to meet Medusa’s eyes.</p>
<p>The girl, Medusa, activated her Eyes of Enticement. When Zhou Wen’s eyes met hers, Zhou Wen, who should have been petrified, didn’t show any abnormalities. Instead, after the girl-formed Medusa was slightly jolted, her body gradually petrified.</p>
<p>It really works! Zhou Wen was delighted. Although it seemed to be a passive ability, there were many terrifying existences with Eye-type abilities. It would be a good Life Soul if it could restrain all Eye-type abilities.</p>
<p>Medusa had only just begun petrifying when she activated her snake-haired demoness form. After she transformed into a demoness, she used the Eyes of Petrification to look at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued using Mirror Eyes to fend her off, and the snake demoness’s eyes showed signs of petrification, but it wasn’t obvious.</p>
<p>Even the Eyes of Petrification can be reflected. I wonder what will happen when I face the Bright Torch Vision World? After killing the demoness and seeing that nothing useful dropped, Zhou Wen eagerly switched maps to Zhuolu. He wanted to head to the Torch Dragon temple to see if he could restrain Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen stood in front of Torch Dragon Youngling and fought it, he forced it to use the Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Mirror Eyes to meet Torch Dragon Youngling’s gaze. Zhou Wen clearly felt that he wasn’t being sucked into the Vision World, but it only lasted for a short period of time. Then, the blood-colored avatar was sucked into the Vision World as the game screen went black.</p>
<p>Although he failed to restrain the Bright Torch Vision World, he was rather pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>This was because Mirror Eyes had some influence on the Bright Torch Vision World. However, due to its weak strength, it was ultimately cracked by Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>If Mirror Eyes can reach a Perfect Body, or even advance to the Mythical stage in the future, it might be able to resist the Bright Torch Vision World. With this possibility in mind, Zhou Wen became excited again as he began studying how to evolve Mirror Eyes.</p>
<p>However, despite trying many methods, Mirror Eyes didn’t show any changes. Be it using Mirror Eyes to reflect the power of Eye-type powers or using Essence Energy to strengthen Mirror Eyes, the outcome was useless.</p>
<p>Unable to find a way to advance Mirror Eyes for the time being, Zhou Wen was out of options. All he could do was go online and read up on some information regarding Eye-type powers. He hoped to obtain inspiration to find a way to advance Mirror Eyes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen worked hard for two days and came up with all sorts of ideas, but they were useless.</p>
<p>It’s not a solution if this continues. I should make a trip to the East Sea first. I can raise Glimmer and also see if I can kill that dimensional creature that’s proficient in spatial teleportation. Zhou Wen took Ya’er along.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen guessed that Yin Talisman King wouldn’t come looking for trouble with him anytime soon. He didn’t expect Yin Talisman King to be that afraid of The Thearch that he wouldn’t dare cause trouble for him.</p>
<p>However, Yin Talisman King had lost an arm and looked to be seriously injured. It wouldn’t be easy for him to recover anytime soon.</p>
<p>It’s a pity that I didn’t get Yin Talisman King to hand over the Yin Talisman Sutra. That’s Yellow Emperor’s Essence Energy Art. It must be extraordinary, Zhou Wen thought regretfully.</p>
<p>The battle between Yellow Emperor and Chiyou back then was undoubtedly a battle between Guardians. Now, it was almost certain that Yellow Emperor and Chiyou had contracted Guardians. Furthermore, the Guardians they had contracted were definitely top-notch.</p>
<p>From the conversation between Yin Talisman King and The Thearch, the Guardian that Yellow Emperor contracted should be the Guardian of the Immortals. Then, which race did Chiyou’s Guardian come from? Zhou Wen couldn’t figure it out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare waste too much time on the way. He headed straight for the East Sea’s city, hoping to resolve the dimensional creature as soon as possible. If a Companion Egg dropped, it was very likely that he could resolve the advancement problem of Civilized Country.</p>
<p>Along the way, Zhou Wen was still extremely careful and wary of Yin Talisman King. Thankfully, Yin Talisman King didn’t appear, saving Zhou Wen a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The Lu family’s Sea Gazing City was a newly-established city after the dimensional storms. As there were some good dimensional zones nearby, many powerful families migrated here, turning the originally small fishing village into the present Sea Gazing City.</p>
<p>The Lu family was a family that had migrated here. Now, the Lu family was basically the only major family in Sea Gazing City.</p>
<h3 id='chapter901'>Chapter 901: Turtle Tomb</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>When Zhou Wen arrived at the Lu family residence, the Lu family warmly welcomed him.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen mentioned the dimensional creature, the Lu family members who received him only gave him a general summary of the situation. Then, they told Zhou Wen that they hoped he could stay with them for two days. After everyone arrived, the Lu family’s patriarch would personally take them to the place where the dimensional creature appeared.</p>
<p>After inquiring, he learned that the An family wasn’t the only one that had accepted the Lu family’s invitation. The Xia and Zhang families had also sent people. There were also many famous freelance hunters.</p>
<p>The Lu family planned on taking everyone over together. When the time came, whoever had the ability to kill the dimensional creature on the spot would receive the Lu family’s offered conditions.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that this was fair. The Lu family only hoped to resolve the problem. As for who killed the dimensional creature, they didn’t care.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on staying in the Lu family residence. Since they would set off in two days, he left the Lu family and planned on visiting the nearby dimensional zones. He might be able to find the tiny palm symbols.</p>
<p>There were four or five famous dimensional zones in Sea Gazing City. The most famous one was half on land and half in the sea. That dimensional zone was named Turtle Tomb.</p>
<p>In fact, Turtle Tomb wasn’t a tomb, but a dimensional zone with countless turtles. It included a large area of beach and shallow sea.</p>
<p>The reason for the name Turtle Tomb was related to an ancient myth.</p>
<p>As ancient people didn’t understand the principle of the water cycle, and only saw rivers flow into the sea day and night, as the seawater never overflowed, they therefore believed that there was a huge abyss to the east of the sea. All the seawater eventually flowed into the bottomless abyss.</p>
<p>This abyss was known as the Sinkhole by the ancients.</p>
<p>Above the East Sea, there were five immortal mountains—Daiyu, Yuanqiao, Fanghu, Yingzhou, and Penglai. Due to the impact of the water, the immortal mountains constantly drifted in the direction of the Sinkhole, making both humans and deities worry.</p>
<p>One of the Sea Gods was afraid that the immortal mountains would slip into the Sinkhole, so he sent fifteen gigantic sea turtles. Three sea turtles formed a group as they held back the five immortal mountains, preventing them from sliding into the Sinkhole.</p>
<p>Everything was originally fine, but after countless years, a few giants came to the beach and used bait to capture six of the turtles. They also untied the ropes on the turtles’ back.</p>
<p>This resulted in a huge disaster. Daiyu and Yuanqiao lost the pull from the sea turtles and eventually sank into the Sinkhole. Only Fanghu, Yingzhou, and Penglai remained.</p>
<p>Legend had it that Turtle Tomb was where the giants had cooked the six sea turtles. Furthermore, they had thrown the turtle shells into the seaside. At high tide, the huge turtle shells would be submerged. And when the tide receded, the turtle shells would be revealed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know the veracity of the legend, but in Turtle Tomb, large swaths of reefs would appear after the tide fell. They were like tiny islands numbering a total of six. On each island, there were many different types of dimensional sea turtles.</p>
<p>All the sea turtles in Turtle Tomb had one Companion Form—armor. It had extremely strong defense. Among Companion Beasts of the same level, the sea turtles’ defense was considered top-notch.</p>
<p>Some special types of turtle armor had insane defense.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it produced a very famous Essence Energy Skill, Turtle Breath. It was available from the Mortal stage to the Epic stage. After cultivating Turtle Breath, one could temporarily stop their heartbeat and breathing. The higher the level, the longer Turtle Breath could last. It was a necessary skill for faking death.</p>
<p>Liu Yun had faked his death before. He had used Turtle Breath, and it was at the Epic stage.</p>
<p>Of course, the true use of Turtle Breath wasn’t to feign death, but to converge one’s aura. It prevented dimensional creatures, that relied on aura to determine where humans were, from detecting humans. The effect was equivalent to invisibility.</p>
<p>As for the Mythical Turtle Breath, legend had it that someone had once had it drop, but no one had seen it.</p>
<p>It wasn’t even noon when Zhou Wen arrived at Turtle Tomb. From afar, he could see many people fighting the sea turtles on the beach. And not far away, he could see several huge reef islands. There were fewer humans on them.</p>
<p>The sea turtles on the beach weren’t of high levels. They were basically at the Mortal stage. Most of the people who came here to hunt sea turtles were people who hadn’t cultivated for long.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in the sea turtles here, but he continued walking slowly along the beach as he searched for the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>Before coming, An Sheng had told Zhou Wen a legend. Some people said that if the islands formed from the six turtle shells floated away one day, they would definitely head to the Sinkhole to continue fulfilling their mission. Following them might lead to the Daiyu and Yuanqiao immortal islands that had sunk into the Sinkhole.</p>
<p>On the beach of the turtle tomb, two men saw Zhou Wen. One of them said in puzzlement, “Why is he here?”</p>
<p>“The An family likely sent him to hunt that dimensional creature and help the An family obtain the rights to Fiend Dust,” another man said.</p>
<p>These two men weren’t real men. Instead, they were Uesugi Nao and the female guard who had used Body Transformation. It wasn’t convenient for them to use their identities to visit Sea City, so they could only use Body Transformation to change their appearances and come to Sea City incognito.</p>
<p>Just like Zhou Wen, they had to stay in Sea Gazing City temporarily because of the Lu family. Since they had nothing to do, they came to Turtle Tomb to take a look.</p>
<p>This was an open dimensional zone. Anyone could come here without any identification. They naturally didn’t fancy the sea turtles on the beach. Just as they were about to head to Turtle Island, they unexpectedly saw Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao rolled her eyes and said to the female guard, “Let’s go over and greet him.”</p>
<p>“Why invite trouble?” The female guard was somewhat unwilling.</p>
<p>“He’s our competitor by coming here. Isn’t it more advantageous for us to find out more about our competitor? Don’t worry, I have a way to obtain information from him,” Uesugi Nao said as she walked towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Although the female guard didn’t agree with Uesugi Nao’s actions, she still followed.</p>
<p>“Hello, are you Zhou Wen?” Uesugi Nao approached Zhou Wen and greeted him with a man’s voice.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already sensed that someone was looking at him. He had discovered Uesugi Nao and the female guard, but he didn’t recognize them. He only felt that one of them had a somewhat familiar gaze.</p>
<p>Seeing them come over and greet him, Zhou Wen looked at them in puzzlement and said, “I’m Zhou Wen. Who are you?”</p>
<p>“You’re really Zhou Wen. That’s great. We are your fans and especially admire you. I never expected to meet you here.” Uesugi Nao pretended to be excited as she took out a notebook and pen and handed them to Zhou Wen. “Can I have your autograph?”</p>
<p>“No.” Zhou Wen turned around and left.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>His Explosive Fiend Man had the Death List skill. By signing it, it was equivalent to giving his life to the Explosive Fiend Man. Ever since he learned of such a skill, Zhou Wen basically stopped signing autographs, much less giving autographs to strangers.</p>
<h3 id='chapter902'>Chapter 902: Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen quickly left without looking back. Uesugi Nao stood there in a daze with a notebook and pen.</p>
<p>From Uesugi Nao’s point of view, Zhou Wen’s reaction was clearly unreasonable. Even if he wasn’t willing to give his fans autographs, a normal person wouldn’t have such an attitude.</p>
<p>“Forget it. Let’s go,” the female guard said to Uesugi Nao.</p>
<p>“I know the reason. Go back now. I have my ways,” Uesugi Nao said to the female guard as she walked in another direction.</p>
<p>When she reached an empty spot, Uesugi Nao returned to her original appearance and changed back into female clothes before heading to the beach again.</p>
<p>Although Uesugi Nao had never liked men who treated women as accessories, she had to admit that women had a huge advantage in certain aspects.</p>
<p>Ordinary people might be impatient with male fans who clamored for autographs, but they would be much more patient towards female fans, especially beautiful and cute ones.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao was very confident in her appearance and figure. It was much better than her transformation as Xu Ai.</p>
<p>Since I have the qualities, it’s not a bad thing to occasionally use them, Uesugi Nao thought as she walked up the beach and walked towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still strolling on the beach, his main goal to search for the tiny palm symbol. As he walked, he felt someone watching him.</p>
<p>He turned around and looked at the source of his gaze, but he realized that it wasn’t the two men from before. Instead, it was a beautiful girl who looked less than twenty years old. There was a hint of charm in her beauty. She was a rare beauty.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen staring at her, Uesugi Nao revealed a charming smile. From her point of view, it was a very advantageous weapon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared at Uesugi Nao’s eyes and found them somewhat familiar. However, it was difficult to tell with just one look. He wanted to take a closer look to determine where he had seen a woman with such eyes.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao thought to herself, Indeed, men are all the same.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Uesugi Nao walked towards Zhou Wen. Her beautiful hair fluttered under the sea breeze as her thin clothes clung tightly to her body, revealing her exquisite figure.</p>
<p>Such a style was comparable to a model on the runway. It was more natural and delightful, something that models lacked.</p>
<p>“My name is Hai’er. I seem to have seen you somewhere before. Can you tell me your name?” Uesugi Nao came in front of Zhou Wen, tidied her hair, and said to him with a smile.</p>
<p>“You remembered wrongly. I don’t know you.” Zhou Wen thought carefully and indeed, he didn’t know this woman. With that said, he turned around and left.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao was slightly taken aback. Seeing that Zhou Wen had already turned around and left, she calmed herself down and chased after him. She stood in front of him and said, “It’s fine if you don’t know me. I think you’re very special. Can we get to know each other?”</p>
<p>“No, please make way.” Zhou Wen brushed Uesugi Nao’s hand aside and glanced at the reef behind her before walking to the other side.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao stood there in a daze for quite some time. By the time she snapped to her senses, Zhou Wen had already walked far away.</p>
<p>Is this guy… a woman who used Body Transformation? Uesugi Nao thought with a strange expression.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen circled the beach but didn’t find the tiny palm symbol. Instead, he killed a few sea turtles that crawled out of the sea.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they were all at the Mortal stage, so nothing dropped.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull and rode it towards the islands in the sea. The six islands in Turtle Tomb could only be seen when the tide receded.</p>
<p>According to the information Zhou Wen had obtained, there would occasionally be Mythical sea turtles on the six turtle shell islands, but there were very few of them. Instead, there were quite a number of Legendary and Epic sea turtles.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in ordinary sea turtles. He mainly wanted to head to the island to see if there was a tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>There were also people hunting sea turtles on Turtle Shell Island. These people were clearly much stronger. Most of them were at the Legendary stage, and occasionally, Epic existences could be seen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in them. He circled the first Turtle Shell Island and didn’t find the tiny palm symbol. Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly saw a behemoth rush out from the seawater beside him.</p>
<p>It was a sea turtle that was the size of an elephant. The turtle shell looked about the same as the typical iron-armored turtle. It was black, but it looked darker.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the patterns on the turtle’s back were golden. They were like golden threads that outlined a strange pattern on the turtle shell.</p>
<p>“Mythical Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle!” Not far away, someone exclaimed.</p>
<p>His shout attracted the attention of the people nearby. Some people retreated the moment they saw the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle, while others rushed over.</p>
<p>Those who dared to rush over were basically at the Epic stage.</p>
<p>As the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle wasn’t fast, Epic creatures had the chance to dodge. Furthermore, with several Epic entities attacking from different directions, it made it difficult for the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle to deal any damage.</p>
<p>The sea turtles in Turtle Tomb had very strong defenses, but their combat strength wasn’t very strong. This was probably the only Mythical creature that could be bullied by a few Epic entities.</p>
<p>However, the Epic humans’ offensive strength was useless against the Black Iron Gold Thread Tortoise. All sorts of Essence Energy Skills and Companion Beasts’ abilities struck it, producing metallic clangs, but they hardly left a mark.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched from the side for a while but didn’t immediately attack the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao also went to the island. When she saw the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle, she had an idea. I can use the excuse of competing with Zhou Wen for the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle to test his strength.</p>
<p>After seeing Zhou Wen’s sword technique, Uesugi Nao didn’t dare underestimate him despite believing that she had the Great Skyfiend Guardian that made her better than Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao felt that Zhou Wen might be a key opponent if she wanted to obtain the Lu family’s Fiend Dust rights. Furthermore, Zhou Wen represented the An family. It would be best if she could think of a way to get Zhou Wen to quit before the dimensional creature hunting began.</p>
<p>I might not be as good as you in sword arts, but you might not be able to beat me in actual combat. As Uesugi Nao thought about it, she approached the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle.</p>
<p>The Epic humans clearly didn’t have a good way to deal with the Black Iron Gold Thread Tortoise. Their attacks couldn’t penetrate its defense.</p>
<p>After watching for a while, Zhou Wen gained a general understanding of the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle. This Mythical creature basically had all its talent in defense. It was very weak in other aspects. As long as he could break through its defense, it would be very easy to kill it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter903'>Chapter 903: Fighting Uesugi Nao</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Battle God Halberd that had recently dropped and stabbed at the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle’s head.</p>
<p>The Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle’s turtle shell was the hardest. Comparatively speaking, its extended limbs and head didn’t have such strong defense. The Golden Battle God Halberd also had Unstoppable. With this strike, it was very likely that it could pierce through its neck.</p>
<p>However, just as the Golden Battle God Halberd was about to pierce the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle’s neck, a blade beam suddenly slashed out and struck the Golden Battle God Halberd.</p>
<p>The blade beam was fast and ruthless. It actually sent the Golden Battle God Halberd in Zhou Wen’s hand to the side, preventing him from stabbing the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned his head and saw a beautiful girl from where the blade beam flew over. She held a strangely-shaped narrow blade in her hand. Zhou Wen remembered that Sei Gasakai had used a similar blade. However, they also called such a blade a sword.</p>
<p>“Why did you attack me?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown when he saw that the girl was the girl who had spoken to him previously. She seemed to be named Hai’er.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao held the Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi and said, “It’s rare to chance upon a Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle. Of course, it belongs to whoever has the ability. Is that wrong?”</p>
<p>The Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi was also known as the Ame-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi. It was formed by Orochi.</p>
<p>“That’s true.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he suddenly thrust the Golden Battle God Halberd at Uesugi Nao.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao was delighted as she didn’t hesitate to welcome him with her Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi. She thought to herself, Zhou Wen, I’ll let you know how powerful I am today.</p>
<p>Just as the Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi was about to collide with the Golden Battle God Halberd, she suddenly heard a bell ring. Uesugi Nao immediately felt her head buzz as she felt dizzy for a moment.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to deal with Uesugi Nao. The Golden Battle God Halberd stabbed into the head of the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle and killed it. Then, it lifted its massive body and threw it into the air.</p>
<p>The Golden Divine Light at the tip of the Golden Battle God Halberd quickly streaked across the turtle’s abdomen, slicing it open. A dimensional crystal dropped and Zhou Wen grabbed it. It was an Essence Energy Skill Crystal.</p>
<p>By the time Uesugi Nao recovered from her dizziness, the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle’s corpse had landed on the ground. As for the people who had been attacking the Black Gold Thread Turtle, they had also recovered from their dizziness and were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>A young-looking youth had actually killed the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle in the blink of an eye. It was truly shocking.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao was alarmed and furious. She was alarmed because if Zhou Wen had attacked her while she was dizzy, he might not have been able to kill her, but he would have made her suffer quite a bit. She was furious because Zhou Wen didn’t seem to treat her as an opponent at all. He had only used a feint to kill the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle. He had been fooling her from the beginning.</p>
<p>“Leave the dimensional crystal behind.” Uesugi Nao didn’t dare underestimate Zhou Wen again. She slashed at Zhou Wen with the Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi at lightning speed as the blade beam tore out like a wheel.</p>
<p>The Great Might Vajra Bull beneath Zhou Wen rang the bell again. Almost at the same time, the Golden Battle God Halberd in Zhou Wen’s hand stabbed at Uesugi Nao’s heart.</p>
<p>Hum!</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao was once again stunned, but the moment the Golden Battle God Halberd stabbed her chest, her body vanished. What the Golden Battle God Halberd stabbed was only her robe.</p>
<p>Having escaped her clothes, Uesugi Nao was wrapped in white clothes. Only her eyes were exposed, making her look like she was wearing an ancient ninja costume.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao held the blade with both hands and slashed down with astonishing speed. The blade beam descended like a wheel.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen brandished the Golden Battle God Halberd and blocked Uesugi Nao’s blade beam and blade. Uesugi Nao’s blade left a mark on the Golden Battle God Halberd.</p>
<p>What a sharp blade. It’s probably even sharper than the Golden Overlord Sword. Zhou Wen was somewhat interested in the blade in Uesugi Nao’s hand, but he didn’t know that it was transformed from Orochi.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao landed on the ground as white fog emitted from her body. She suddenly vanished and when she appeared again, she was already behind Zhou Wen. She slashed down again.</p>
<p>The Great Might Vajra Bull’s cooldown was up. It rang the bell again.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao had already predicted the bell’s ringing. At the same time the bell rang, her body suddenly exploded, turning into a mist that vanished, preventing Zhou Wen from attacking her while she was dizzy.</p>
<p>By the time she appeared again, she had already appeared beside Zhou Wen. She slashed at the Great Might Vajra Bull’s leg with her Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen brandished his halberd to block Uesugi Nao’s blade. Uesugi Nao did a roll and disappeared into the sand.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi stabbed out of the sand, straight at the Great Might Vajra Bull’s abdomen.</p>
<p>An escape technique? It’s a little similar, but it’s also a little different. Zhou Wen put away the Great Might Vajra Bull and leaped into the air with Ya’er in his arms. He dodged Uesugi Nao’s blade beam and retracted the Golden Battle God Halberd.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>The Golden Battle God Halberd blocked twice, but it had two blade marks left on it. If it was slashed a few more times, it would probably have snapped.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao swept her blade upwards. The blade beams were so fast that they seemed to have no shadows. Each strike was faster and more ruthless.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s figure was elegant. No matter how fast and ruthless Uesugi Nao’s blade techniques were, no matter how sinister they were, they couldn’t touch Zhou Wen’s clothes.</p>
<p>How could a Mythical Transcendent Flying Immortal be struck so easily?</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao pushed her skills to the limit. She constantly changed positions and used different skills, but nothing worked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to observe Uesugi Nao’s every move and realized that although her skill was very similar to the Five-Element escape technique, there were still some differences.</p>
<p>The Five-Element escape technique was to assimilate one’s body with the five elements. It required one to possess the physique of the five elements. Furthermore, her technique didn’t assimilate her body with the five elements. It only enveloped the power of the five elements. Such an escape technique could be used for short distances, but it definitely couldn’t be used for long-distance escaping.</p>
<p>Furthermore, her body was still present. She hadn’t completely assimilated the five elements. Even when using the escape technique, Truth Listener could still hear her.</p>
<p>Once Uesugi Nao escaped into the sand again, Zhou Wen used his finger as a sword and stabbed out a sword beam. It was the first move of the Thirteen Swords of the Peach Blossom Valley’s white-robed man—Immortal Guides the Way.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao was just about to rush out when she saw the sword beam land. It was too late to change positions, so she could only brandish her blade to block Zhou Wen’s sword beam.</p>
<p>The Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi was very sharp and it forcefully sliced open the sword aura from the middle. However, to Uesugi Nao’s horror, the sword aura that was split into two didn’t disperse. It continued to stab at her, and Uesugi Nao no longer had the strength to resist.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A crazy power surged out from Uesugi Nao’s body like a fountain.</p>
<h3 id='chapter904'>Chapter 904: Punching Great Skyfiend</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>A black armor appeared on Uesugi Nao’s body. When the sword beam struck the armor, it failed to injure it. Instead, the sword beam completely shattered.</p>
<p>Great Skyfiend? Don’t tell me my luck is that good. I just randomly encountered someone, and she’s actually the contractor of Great Skyfiend? Zhou Wen immediately recognized the armor on Uesugi Nao’s body. It was identical to Great Skyfiend on the cube’s rankings.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao was forced to use Great Skyfiend, so she no longer hid it. She leaped up from the sand. With the augmentation of the Great Skyfiend armor, Uesugi Nao had the speed of a Mythical creature. She was much faster than before.</p>
<p>The Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi slashed at Zhou Wen like a phantom. It was so fast that almost no one could see the trajectory of the blade. With a flash of light, the blade was about to hit Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s movement technique was elegant like a flying immortal. It didn’t seem fast, but he dodged the blade by a hair’s breadth. The Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi brushed past his ear.</p>
<p>Gale Slash… Multi-Slash… Samsara Slash… Boomerang Wind Slash…</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao used her blade techniques again with the augmentation of the Great Skyfiend armor.</p>
<p>However, this time, due to her Mythical Speed and Strength, her blade techniques seemed to have activated an acceleration switch. They were unbelievably fast.</p>
<p>Wherever the blade beam passed, terrifying ditches appeared on the surrounding reefs. The humans on the island had long fled in horror. Even the sea turtles on the island scrambled to escape into the sea.</p>
<p>“That’s Great Skyfiend! Great Skyfiend who’s ranked first!”</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, it’s really Great Skyfiend. I think I saw an extremely beautiful girl before she transformed into Great Skyfiend. That girl should be Uesugi Nao, right?”</p>
<p>“I never expected the owner of Great Skyfiend to be such a beautiful girl. She’s just a little too ruthless. That blade technique is really lethal!”</p>
<p>“Who’s the young man fighting Great Skyfiend? How impressive. He actually managed to dodge Great Skyfiend’s attack with just his movement technique.”</p>
<p>“I think he has no choice but to dodge. He has no chance of retaliating.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. Look at that young man. He’s still holding a little girl in his arms. Look at how calm that little girl is. If that young man is really dodging in a sorry state, he would definitely scare the little girl in his arms. The little girl’s calmness can only mean one thing. The young man is completely composed.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Speaking of which, who is that young man? He’s so young. I’m afraid he’s not even twenty, right? To be able to fight Great Skyfiend without using a Companion Beast is a little terrifying.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s name and looks were well known among the six families and some wealthy families, but there weren’t many ordinary citizens who knew him.</p>
<p>If someone from the six families or the bureau were here, they wouldn’t be surprised to see this scene.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used the Godfiend Life Providence and Glimmer Life Soul to complement Transcendent Flying Immortal, pushing his movement technique to its limits.</p>
<p>Although Uesugi Nao had the augmentation of Great Skyfiend and her Speed and Strength had reached the Mythical stage, she still failed to touch Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Impossible… I have Great Skyfiend augmenting me. My speed is already at the Mythical stage. He’s only at the Epic stage. There’s such a huge difference in basic Speed. How can he dodge my attacks time and time again? Uesugi Nao found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>She had always felt that unless it was a human who had contracted a Guardian, no one could resist her after she obtained Great Skyfiend.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s appearance shattered the pride in her heart. Ignoring everything else, Zhou Wen’s movement technique was actually able to match her Mythical speed. She found it unacceptable.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao couldn’t accept such an outcome. She constantly stimulated Great Skyfiend’s strength, allowing her movement techniques and blade techniques to become faster and faster. She had to defeat Zhou Wen no matter what.</p>
<p>However, her blade still couldn’t touch Zhou Wen. She could clearly sense that Zhou Wen wasn’t as fast as her, but her blade was always dodged by him.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen dodged Uesugi Nao’s attack, he observed Great Skyfiend’s abilities.</p>
<p>His movement technique was indeed not as fast as Uesugi Nao’s, but at least Uesugi Nao wasn’t so fast that he couldn’t react.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was best at movement techniques. Transcendent Flying Immortal had been trained by him from when it was a low-level skill. Be it technique or compatibility with Zhou Wen, they were incomparable to other skills.</p>
<p>Amidst the terrifying blade shadows, Zhou Wen tapped his toes and floated in the air like a fallen leaf dancing in the wind. No matter how fast Uesugi Nao’s blade techniques were, they couldn’t touch him.</p>
<p>Speed should be at the top of the Mythical stage, so is Strength. Although I don’t know what Great Skyfiend’s skills are, just from his augmentation of Uesugi Nao’s stats, he’s undoubtedly an extremely powerful Guardian. Zhou Wen deduced Great Skyfiend’s abilities to gain more information.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen also knew that Uesugi Nao had only used Great Skyfiend’s stats and hadn’t used his abilities. The strength of a Guardian depended on their abilities.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept waiting to see what abilities Great Skyfiend had. What were his Life Providence, Life Soul, Wheel of Destiny, and skills?</p>
<p>However, Uesugi Nao never used Great Skyfiend’s abilities. She only wanted to use her blade techniques to defeat Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I have to give her some pressure so that she can use Great Skyfiend’s powers. With a thought, Zhou Wen watched as Uesugi Nao slashed out again. This time, he didn’t dodge.</p>
<p>A roar alarmed the world as Tyrant Behemoth descended out of nowhere and transformed into a boxing glove that appeared in Zhou Wen’s hand. Zhou Wen brandished his fist to meet Uesugi Nao’s Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth! Uesugi Nao’s pupils constricted. She never expected Zhou Wen to be Tyrant Behemoth’s owner.</p>
<p>In the last cube ranking battle, Orochi had been defeated by Tyrant Behemoth and nearly devoured by it.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Uesugi Nao. Everyone watching the battle on the beach also saw the terrifying light and roar before Tyrant Behemoth condensed into a boxing glove.</p>
<p>However, before they could react, Zhou Wen’s fist had already struck Uesugi Nao’s blade.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>With Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength augmentation, the power of Zhou Wen’s punch was extremely terrifying at the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>The extremely sharp Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi slammed into Tyrant Behemoth’s boxing glove. Not only did it fail to slice open the boxing glove, but it was also sent flying by the shockwave. Uesugi Nao also retreated a few steps from the terrifying force. The reef beneath her feet shattered as shocking cracks appeared.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, so it’s Tyrant Behemoth’s owner. It’s no wonder he’s so strong.”</p>
<p>“So Tyrant Behemoth’s owner is from our East District. He’s so young!”</p>
<p>“Haha, I knew it. Great Skyfiend isn’t anything impressive. It’s just that the previous top four didn’t participate in the battle. Otherwise, how could she have arrogantly taken first place? The people overseas are this and nothing more.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter905'>Chapter 905: Won’t Do It a Third Time</h3>
<p>Uesugi Nao stared intently at Zhou Wen as both new and old grudges surged in her heart. She extended her hand and beckoned for the Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi that had flown out to rush forward to fight Zhou Wen again.</p>
<p>Suddenly!</p>
<p>A strange bird-like cry sounded from afar. When Uesugi Nao heard the sound, she glared hatefully at Zhou Wen. White mist exploded from her body before she vanished.</p>
<p>“What Great Skyfiend? That’s all? She was sent running with one punch. She even said on the cube that she wanted to kill Tyrant Behemoth to avenge her humiliation. Is she sure she’s not trying to become a joke?”</p>
<p>“Tyrant Behemoth is still the best. Tyrant Behemoth’s owner is also powerful.”</p>
<p>“Does anyone know who that young man is? Is he from the six families?”</p>
<p>“No… He’s not from the six families…” At that moment, a middle-aged man held back his excitement and muttered to himself.</p>
<p>On his shoulder was a high-speed camera. He had already taken a video of Zhou Wen’s battle with Uesugi Nao.</p>
<p>He was a reporter. He had originally come to Turtle Island to try his luck and see if he could encounter the break-out creature that had recently wreaked havoc nearby. To his surprise, he happened to capture this battle.</p>
<p>As a news reporter, he was rather well-informed and happened to know Zhou Wen. After all, many people knew that Zhou Wen was Wang Mingyuan’s disciple. He only knew about Zhou Wen because of this matter.</p>
<p>He originally wanted to interview Zhou Wen, but after Uesugi Nao escaped, Zhou Wen quickly vanished.</p>
<p>The reporter had no choice but to rush back. After getting his colleagues to process the footage, he quickly wrote the news article and posted it along with the footage.</p>
<p>Ever since Great Skyfiend took first place on the rankings, its ranking had been unmoved, but not many people had seen her fight.</p>
<p>When this video was released, it quickly caused a huge commotion. It wasn’t just the average person. Even the six families wanted to study Great Skyfiend’s abilities. This video became precious information for studying Great Skyfiend.</p>
<p>The ordinary citizens didn’t care about Great Skyfiend. They only cared about two things.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was Tyrant Behemoth’s master, and Great Skyfiend was sent flying by Zhou Wen’s Tyrant Behemoth punch.</p>
<p>“Tyrant Behemoth is really too powerful. Unfortunately, in the last ranking battle, Tyrant Behemoth didn’t have the chance to challenge Tai Sui. Otherwise, Tyrant Behemoth might have been first.”</p>
<p>“I thought Great Skyfiend was something impressive, but it turns out he’s nothing much. He couldn’t even defeat Tyrant Behemoth, who was ranked fourth. If he were to encounter the first Tai Sui, wouldn’t he have no chance of escaping?”</p>
<p>“Those fellows overseas always think that they are very strong. From the looks of it, they are really weak.”</p>
<p>“Tyrant Behemoth’s owner seems to be Zhou Wen. I remember that he’s Wang Mingyuan’s student.”</p>
<p>“Wang Mingyuan is Wang Mingyuan, and Zhou Wen is Zhou Wen. It’s completely different. I heard that Zhou Wen is from Luoyang’s An family.”</p>
<p>“I’m just afraid that he will be like Wang Mingyuan. When that happens, our Federation will be in an even more difficult situation.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao nearly vomited blood when she saw these reports.</p>
<p>If her female guard hadn’t used the emergency signal to make her retreat, she wouldn’t have retreated without a fight. In the end, it was unknown which b*stard had created the video as though she had fled after being sent flying with a punch. The editing was clearly biased towards Zhou Wen and it was deliberately edited to give such an illusion.</p>
<p>B*stard, don’t let me know who edited this video. I’ll skin him alive and pull out his bones. Uesugi Nao was furious.</p>
<p>She never expected Zhou Wen to be Tyrant Behemoth’s owner. That already left her depressed, but to be written in such a manner as though she was afraid of Zhou Wen and Tyrant Behemoth made her feel indignant.</p>
<p>“Miss, you shouldn’t have used Great Skyfiend at that time. Now that Great Skyfiend has been exposed ahead of time, we are at a disadvantage,” said the female guard.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing disadvantageous about it. Great Skyfiend has the strength to kill the break-out creature. This is a fact that can never be changed,” Uesugi Nao said.</p>
<p>The female guard said, “Although that’s the case, everyone knows that you and Great Skyfiend are here. I’m afraid that the An family will suspect that you are related to the death of the break-out creature…”</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao naturally knew that she shouldn’t have exposed Great Skyfiend. She said helplessly, “I didn’t want to either. I was forced to do so back then. If I didn’t use Great Skyfiend, I’m afraid I would have been heavily injured by Zhou Wen. I underestimated his strength. I never expected him to be Tyrant Behemoth’s master.”</p>
<p>The female guard pondered for a moment before saying, “Miss, you end up suffering every time you encounter Zhou Wen. Perhaps his Life Providence jinxes you. I think it’s best not to have too much contact with him in the future.”</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao said, “You’re thinking too much. I won’t be careless next time. I’ll use Great Skyfiend’s abilities with all my might. Even if he has Tyrant Behemoth, he’s not my match.”</p>
<p>The female guard still wanted to say something, but Uesugi Nao continued, “Besides, even if I avoid him, he’s here for the break-out creatures and the Fiend Dust. How can I avoid him?”</p>
<p>The female guard thought that it made sense, but she still exhorted Uesugi Nao. “Miss, I have a nagging feeling that this Zhou Wen is somewhat odd. He has a bad influence on you. If you encounter him again, you have to be careful.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I definitely won’t make the same mistake a third time,” Uesugi Nao said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to see what abilities Great Skyfiend had, but Uesugi Nao had escaped. This left him somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>Although Slaughterer had already advanced to a Perfect Body and didn’t need to kill Guardians, killing every Guardian made sense. From the perspective of humans and Earth, Guardians were undoubtedly invaders.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I didn’t find the tiny palm symbol. I wonder if I’ll have the chance to visit Turtle’s Tomb again. Zhou Wen felt a little regretful.</p>
<p>He definitely couldn’t go to Turtle Tomb for the next few days. It was unknown if he could return after killing the break-out creature.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it’s not completely fruitless. Zhou Wen took out the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle’s dimensional crystal and used his phone to take a picture.</p>
<p>Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle Crystal: Requires 41 Constitution, 41 Essence Energy, Essence Energy-type Essence Energy Art.</p>
<p>It’s the stats requirement of Constitution and Essence Energy again. This isn’t difficult. After I have 41 Constitution, I can absorb it. It probably won’t take long. Zhou Wen stored the crystal in the Chaos Bead.</p>
<p>He found a hotel nearby and when the hotel owner, who was reading the news on his phone, saw Zhou Wen, he looked at the photo on the news before looking at him. He immediately pointed at him in surprise and shouted, “You’re Zhou Wen!”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he looked at the news on his phone. He realized that he had become famous because of his battle with Great Skyfiend.</p>
<p>The boss warmly welcomed Zhou Wen and even arranged the best room in the hotel for him.</p>
<p>“Boss, can you give me a discount?” Zhou Wen asked as he looked at the room prices.</p>
<p>“Anything will do. If you are unhappy, you can even beat me up, but no discounts,” the boss said firmly.</p>
<p>“Then change it to a standard room for me,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<h3 id='chapter906'>Chapter 906: Sudden Challenge</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>In the end, the boss gave Zhou Wen a 20% discount and allowed him to stay in the VIP room. However, even with a 20% discount, it was still much more expensive than the standard room.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked around the VIP room. It was as though it had been a long time since someone had lived there. There was even dust on the television.</p>
<p>The boss wiped the television in embarrassment and said to Zhou Wen, “My idol, feel free to stay. Breakfast is also provided. It’s quite a sumptuous meal.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a look and saw that the blanket was clean, so he didn’t say anything else.</p>
<p>After the boss left, Zhou Wen took out milk and other food from the chaos space. After heating it up for Ya’er, he got her to eat some nutritious food.</p>
<p>Now was the time for her to grow. She grew a little every day. It showed after some time that she was outgrowing her shoes and clothes.</p>
<p>It was a magical feeling to watch Ya’er grow up day by day.</p>
<p>He switched on his phone and read the news regarding him. The discussion on the Internet was intense, but he wasn’t the focus of discussion. Instead, it was Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>As the reporter only managed to record the second half of the battle by the time he arrived, and it had been deliberately edited, it looked like Zhou Wen was hugging Ya’er and gracefully dodging Uesugi Nao’s attacks. Then, he summoned Tyrant Behemoth and transformed it into a boxing glove before sending Uesugi Nao flying with her blade.</p>
<p>Most people were amazed at Tyrant Behemoth’s strength. The East District people were glad that Tyrant Behemoth’s owner was from the East District, while the West District people claimed that Zhou Wen was only able to defeat Great Skyfiend because of the powerful Companion Beast from their district.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth’s popularity was much higher than its master, Zhou Wen. This made Zhou Wen extremely indignant. Do these people have any taste? If I hadn’t used it well, what’s the use of Tyrant Behemoth no matter how strong it is? If I really let it fight alone, it wouldn’t have been able to touch Uesugi Nao, alright?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had only said it in passing. He didn’t really care about it.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to close the window and continue grinding dungeons, he suddenly saw that the news that was playing was being interrupted.</p>
<p>“Good evening, viewers. I’m Reporter Yourong from the Imperial Capital TV Station. I’m now live in front of the Imperial Capital’s cube. Just a moment ago, a new creature challenged the first ranked Great Skyfiend. From the cube’s screen, we can see that we are no strangers to the Companion Beast that has challenged Great Skyfiend. It’s the Heavy-Armored Titan that once challenged Primordial Sword Immortal in the previous ranking battle. Heavy-Armored Titan is very similar to Tyrant Behemoth. They are both Companion Beasts that focus on Strength and Constitution. Shortly after Great Skyfiend was defeated by Tyrant Behemoth, Heavy-Armored Titan suddenly challenged Great Skyfiend. Its goal is obvious…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was amused when he saw the news. Some people really believed that they could defeat Great Skyfiend and Uesugi Nao with just Strength and Constitution.</p>
<p>In fact, during Zhou Wen’s battle with Great Skyfiend, Uesugi Nao hadn’t used Great Skyfiend’s abilities. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been so easy for Tyrant Behemoth to defeat her.</p>
<p>I wonder if Uesugi Nao will accept the challenge. Zhou Wen decided not to switch off his phone. As he played the news on his phone, he used his mysterious phone to grind dungeons.</p>
<p>Just as he finished grinding the 81 pill essences on Pill Furnace Mountain, he heard the excited voice of Reporter Yourong from the phone. “Dear viewers… Dear viewers… Great Skyfiend has accepted the challenge and is entering the arena…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen put down the mysterious phone and looked at the live broadcast. Indeed, he saw Uesugi Nao, who was wearing Great Skyfiend armor, slowly descend into the cube arena in the void.</p>
<p>This is going to be good. Perhaps I’ll be able to see a portion of Great Skyfiend’s abilities. Zhou Wen could tell from Uesugi Nao’s aura that she was definitely in a bad mood. This spelled bad news for Heavy-Armored Titan.</p>
<p>The owner of Heavy-Armored Titan clearly didn’t think so. He felt that since Tyrant Behemoth could defeat Great Skyfiend, and although Heavy-Armored Titan wasn’t as strong as Tyrant Behemoth, his defense was more outstanding than Tyrant Behemoth’s.</p>
<p>Even if he couldn’t defeat Great Skyfiend, he could use the defense of Heavy-Armored Titan to force Great Skyfiend to use some abilities and employ other means. It would be very helpful in researching Great Skyfiend.</p>
<p>The moment Great Skyfiend entered the arena, Heavy-Armored Titan roared. Its heavy armor lit up as red magma-like demonic patterns appeared on its surface. With the augmentation of the demonic patterns, the already powerful defense of the Heavy-Armored Titan became even crazier.</p>
<p>In the previous ranking battle, the powerful Primordial Sword Immortal failed to break through its defense when the Heavy-Armored Titan used this move.</p>
<p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p>
<p>After three consecutive roars, two halos appeared beneath the feet of Heavy-Armored Titan. A white light barrier also appeared over his body. One could roughly guess that it was a skill that augmented his body.</p>
<p>After doing all of this, Heavy-Armored Titan suddenly charged towards Uesugi Nao, who was levitating in midair. Its body was extremely huge, and every step it took was akin to a horizontally-moving mountain, causing the ground to quake.</p>
<p>Just as it was about to reach Uesugi Nao, Heavy-Armored Titan leaped up and its huge body rose into the air. It clasped its palms together as a fist and struck at Uesugi Nao, who was floating there, with the might of a crushing mountain.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao floated there without moving. She only looked coldly at the massive creature through the Great Skyfiend armor’s visor.</p>
<p>When the Heavy-Armored Titan’s fist was about to reach her, Uesugi Nao finally raised her arm.</p>
<p>The moment she raised her arm, demonic flames spewed out of the Great Skyfiend armor, enveloping Uesugi Nao’s entire body.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The Heavy-Armored Titan’s hands struck Uesugi Nao’s tiny palm, but the mountain-like strike was blocked by the tiny palm. Despite using all its strength, Heavy-Armored Titan failed to move its fist forward at all.</p>
<p>From the audience’s perspective, the scene was even more shocking.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao was as tiny as an ant in front of the Heavy-Armored Titan. The Heavy-Armored Titan that was crashing down like a mountain was blocked by an ant-like palm. The impact such a scene left on their minds was too great.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, an even more unbelievable scene happened.</p>
<p>The demonic flames on Uesugi Nao’s body rose and instantly enveloped Heavy-Armored Titan’s huge body. Furthermore, the demonic flames quickly entered Heavy-Armored Titan’s body through the gaps in the armor.</p>
<p>The owner of Heavy-Armored Titan clearly realized that something was amiss and wanted Heavy-Armored Titan to admit defeat before summoning it back.</p>
<p>However, it was too late. There was a loud bang.</p>
<p>Heavy-Armored Titan exploded like a watermelon above Uesugi Nao’s palm. Fragments and flesh splattered like blood-colored fireworks.</p>
<p>Seeing the name of Heavy-Armored Titan disappear, the entire world fell silent.</p>
<h3 id='chapter907'>Chapter 907: Fatal Temptation</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“That can’t be real, right? Heavy-Armored Titan and Tyrant Behemoth shouldn’t be too different. How did it get instantly killed?”</p>
<p>“What was that? Am I seeing things?”</p>
<p>“Is Heavy-Armored Titan so inferior to Tyrant Behemoth?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Everyone broke into a flurry of discussion. The scene of Great Skyfiend instantly killing the Heavy-Armored Titan was too shocking. Even the members of the six families did not expect that Heavy-Armored Titan, who specialized in defense, would die so quickly.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao’s mood finally improved a little. She had helped Great Skyfiend redeem himself. At the same time, she had also exposed part of Great Skyfiend’s abilities.</p>
<p>However, there was nothing she could do about it. If she took too long to finish off Heavy-Armored Titan, the other families would think that Great Skyfiend was easy to deal with. They would constantly send Mythical creatures to test Great Skyfiend’s strength. That would be even more troublesome.</p>
<p>Now that she had killed Heavy-Armored Titan in one strike, anyone who wanted to test Great Skyfiend’s strength had to consider whether they could afford to lose their Mythical creature.</p>
<p>Even if the number of Mythical Companion Beasts in the six families kept increasing, few people would be willing to lose their Mythical Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>What kind of power was that strike? Zhou Wen thought about the crux of Great Skyfiend’s strike.</p>
<p>It was clearly not a simple clash of strength. Even Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength couldn’t blast through the Heavy-Armored Titan’s armor in one strike, much less shatter it into pieces.</p>
<p>The power of Great Skyfiend clearly had a special effect. That was why Heavy-Armored Titan couldn’t even block a single strike.</p>
<p>However, even if he saw the process with his own eyes, he couldn’t accurately determine what kind of power it was because there were too many possibilities.</p>
<p>It could be the power to something akin to Life Blast. As long as he touched his opponent, he could detonate the opponent’s energy.</p>
<p>It could also be a penetrative power that directly penetrated the heavy armor and destroyed the heavy titan’s body from the inside, preventing it from putting up a resistance.</p>
<p>There were several possibilities that he could think of, and there were also possibilities that he couldn’t think of.</p>
<p>However, after witnessing Great Skyfiend’s attack, he definitely couldn’t let the demonic flames on Uesugi Nao’s body touch him when he fought her again.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Although Heavy-Armored Titan isn’t bad, it’s still much weaker than Tyrant Behemoth. Tyrant Behemoth can defeat Great Skyfiend, but Heavy-Armored Titan can’t even withstand one strike. The difference is too great.”</p>
<p>“I hope Tyrant Behemoth can step forward to challenge Great Skyfiend and snatch back first place. Let those fellows overseas know how powerful we from the Federation are.”</p>
<p>Many people hoped that Tyrant Behemoth could step forward to fight, but Zhou Wen had no intention of doing so.</p>
<p>He hadn’t figured out Great Skyfiend’s exact abilities, and Zhou Wen couldn’t participate in the battle himself. Sending Tyrant Behemoth to challenge Uesugi Nao was no different from sending himself to his death.</p>
<p>I should quickly advance to the Mythical stage. Zhou Wen constantly absorbed Essence Energy Crystals in-game, hoping to quickly raise the Essence Energy Pill’s level.</p>
<p>Ding! After killing Medusa in her demoness state, an Essence Energy Skill Crystal dropped.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen deliberately waited for Medusa to become a demoness before killing her. He had killed Medusa several times while she was in her maiden form, but nothing dropped.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Wen, he had seen Medusa drop two Essence Energy Skill Crystals when he was previously grinding.</p>
<p>One required 41 Constitution and 21 Cursed stat, while the other required 41 Essence Energy and 21 Poison stat. Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy and Poison stat had already met the requirements, so he had been grinding Medusa recently in hopes of obtaining the skill crystal that needed 41 Essence Energy.</p>
<p>Two days ago, he had also obtained a Medusa crystal. Unfortunately, it was the type with a 41 Constitution requirement. Zhou Wen wasn’t able to absorb it, so he had to give it up during a respawn.</p>
<p>Give me the 41 Essence Energy one! Zhou Wen prayed inwardly as he picked it up and was immediately overjoyed. It was the skill crystal that required Essence Energy and Poison stats.</p>
<p>I can finally absorb a Mythical skill! Zhou Wen couldn’t wait to absorb the Essence Energy Skill Crystal.</p>
<p>The crystal transformed into a grayish-white Essence Energy stream that entered the blood-colored avatar’s body. Zhou Wen immediately felt as though his body was being pricked by needles wherever the Essence Energy stream passed.</p>
<p>The Essence Energy constantly circulated in Zhou Wen’s body, forcefully opening up his meridians. After more than an hour, the Essence Energy formed a circulation and finally, all the Essence Energy flowed into Zhou Wen’s hair.</p>
<p>‘Absorbed Medusa Crystal. Attained Mythical Essence Energy Skill: Fatal Temptation.’</p>
<p>It’s indeed not the Eyes of Petrification… Zhou Wen had long guessed that the Essence Energy Skill Crystal that required Constitution and Cursed was the Eyes of Petrification.</p>
<p>What skill is this Fatal Temptation? It has a Poison stat requirement. Don’t tell me it turns my hair into venomous snakes? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but feel uneasy when he thought of his head full of venomous snakes. Such a skill felt a little odd and difficult to accept.</p>
<p>He nervously looked at the introduction of Fatal Temptation and realized that it was indeed a hair skill. He was alarmed, but after carefully reading the introduction, he heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Legend had it that Medusa had the most beautiful long hair in the world. As a result, she became too proud and looked down on Athena, and was turned into a snake-haired demoness.</p>
<p>Fatal Temptation was a skill that allowed one’s hair to be tainted with poison. However, it didn’t turn into venomous snakes. If anyone touched the poisonous hair, they would be poisoned.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried using the Fatal Temptation skill. With a move of his Essence Energy, Zhou Wen’s hair immediately grew crazily and in a blink of an eye, it reached the ground.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen knew that it wasn’t real hair, but hair condensed from Essence Energy.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen realized that it was extremely difficult to control the Poison Hair condensed from Essence Energy. It was unrealistic to use it as a weapon.</p>
<p>Could it be that I can only passively wait for others to touch my hair? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. Such a skill wasn’t something he needed.</p>
<p>However, on second thought, Zhou Wen had an idea. He pulled out a strand of Essence Energy Poison Hair and placed it in water. The Essence Energy Poison Hair immediately dissolved into the water.</p>
<p>Soon, many dimensional creatures in the water were poisoned to death.</p>
<p>So this skill can also be used as poison. In that case, it’s not bad. However, I wonder how potent the poison of Fatal Temptation is. Can it poison a Mythical creature to death? Zhou Wen studied it for a long time and roughly learned how to use Fatal Temptation.</p>
<p>In fact, there was no need for it to be in water. Even in air, Fatal Temptation could emit poisonous fumes, just like perfume. Any creature that smelled it would be poisoned.</p>
<p>However, the poison wasn’t as potent as Zhou Wen imagined. It was somewhat difficult to poison a Mythical creature to death unless a Mythical creature directly swallowed a large amount of Essence Energy Poison Hair.</p>
<p>If he could do that, Zhou Wen had a high chance of killing the Mythical creature himself. There was no need for him to go through so much trouble.</p>
<p>However, if this skill was used against humans, the effects would be very powerful. This was because humans were at the Epic stage at best. Just the poisonous gas emitted from the Poison Hair was enough to deal great damage to humans.</p>

<p>However, Zhou Wen felt that this Fatal Temptation skill was a little uncomfortable. Therefore, he secretly wondered. I wonder if I can combine the Poison Dragon Palm and Fatal Temptation?</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully studied the two Essence Energy Skills. Apart from using different body parts, they were very similar in other aspects.</p>
<p>They were all using poison in the form of Essence Energy, and they both used poison to obtain victory. It didn’t seem impossible to combine them.</p>
<p>It will be great if I could use the poison power of Fatal Temptation on my hands. Zhou Wen was still used to using his hand rather than his hair.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen began the corresponding research and experimentation, hoping to combine the two.</p>
<p>The process wasn’t that easy. Although it was the same conversion of Essence Energy into poison, the circulation method between Essence Energy Skills was still very different. After studying it for a long time, Zhou Wen realized that it wasn’t impossible to fuse the two Essence Energy Arts into one. All he could do was give it a try and add some Essence Energy circulation techniques from another Essence Energy Skill.</p>
<p>At the appointed time, Zhou Wen arrived at the Lu family residence again. This time, the Lu family was still very warm, but they were much more polite and hospitable than the first time he had come.</p>
<p>The current head of the Lu family, Old Master Lu, personally came out to welcome Zhou Wen. Furthermore, from his words, he didn’t treat Zhou Wen as a junior because of his age.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that it was most likely because of his battle with Uesugi Nao that the Lu family paid special attention to him.</p>
<p>After entering the Lu family residence, Zhou Wen saw the others invited by the Lu family. Zhang Xiao was from the Zhang family, but Zhou Wen didn’t know anyone from the Xia family.</p>
<p>However, the Xia family looked at Zhou Wen with a strange expression. It didn’t appear like hatred, but there was no intention of getting close to him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could understand why. He had killed Xia Jiuhuang, and to the Xia family, Xia Jiuhuang was the founder of the Xia family. However, the latter had nearly destroyed the Xia family, so their attitude towards Zhou Wen was very odd.</p>
<p>Old Master Lu didn’t say anything else. After explaining the situation of the break-out creature in detail, he led everyone to the place where the break-out creature had recently appeared.</p>
<p>Half a month ago, the break-out creature had frequently appeared in the vicinity of Sea Gazing City, causing a large number of casualties. There was even one time when it charged into the city and started a massacre, causing unimaginable losses.</p>
<p>However, in the past half month, the break-out creature had seldom approached the coast. Most of the time, it had appeared in the shallow waters, and the number of times it appeared decreased.</p>
<p>The Lu family had been sending people to monitor the movement of the break-out creature. Although they didn’t dare to get too close, with the Lu family’s understanding of this area, they could still determine that the break-out creature should be residing on a nearby island.</p>
<p>The island wasn’t too far from Sea Gazing City, but it was different from Turtle Tomb’s six islands. It was a real island, and it wasn’t a dimensional zone.</p>
<p>The Lu family used a team of sea turtles to take Zhou Wen and company to the island. One by one, the Epic experts of the Lu family controlled the Epic Blackrock Turtles to rapidly swim across the sea.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood on the back of a Blackrock Turtle and looked into the distance. Zhang Xiao led the Zhang family’s white crane team and rode their own white cranes to fly in the sky. They didn’t ride the Blackrock Turtles.</p>
<p>In just over an hour, the island was right in front of them.</p>
<p>“I’ve already informed everyone of the information our Lu family knows. If you are confident, you can head to the island to hunt the break-out creature. If you aren’t confident, I hope you won’t take the risk. After all, life is precious. Also, although this island isn’t a dimensional zone, there have been break-out creatures appearing here often in the past. Therefore, there might be more than one break-out creature on the island. Please be careful. If you discover anything amiss, please retreat over here immediately. Our Lu family will be responsible for evacuating you.” With that said, Old Master Lu turned to Zhou Wen and asked, “Zhou Wen, do you want us to help you take care of the child?”</p>
<p>“There’s no need. The child is afraid of strangers.” Zhou Wen saw that the others had already headed towards the island. He transformed the White Shadow of Poison into wings and flew towards the island.</p>
<p>Before reaching the island, Zhou Wen had already expanded Truth Listener’s monitoring range to its limits, hoping to understand the situation there.</p>
<p>This island wasn’t too big. It was typical of an island formed by volcanic eruption. In the middle was a volcano that occasionally emitted smoke. Although it didn’t erupt, it wasn’t a good place.</p>
<p>The volcano was surrounded by forests. The terrain wasn’t complicated, but the forests were dense. There were many creatures inside, so there might be problems.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Truth Listener’s ability to envelop the entire island and monitor it. However, to his surprise, he didn’t find any traces of the break-out creature on the island.</p>
<p>He also didn’t discover any of the other break-out creatures mentioned by the Lu family. Apart from some insects and birds, there wasn’t a single dimensional creature on the island.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen reached the coast, he stopped and scanned the entire island again. The outcome was the same. He didn’t discover any dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Did the Lu family make a mistake, or did that break-out creature happen to leave? Zhou Wen frowned in thought.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, someone walked over. The person was a freelance hunter. To be invited by the Lu family, he was probably very famous, but Zhou Wen didn’t know him.</p>
<p>The person came in front of Zhou Wen and introduced himself. “My name is Bida. I was born and raised in Sea Gazing City. I’m quite famous among the local freelance hunters.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sized up Bida and didn’t say a word. This person’s aura was very strange. He looked like he was at a Mortal stage and had a weak vital aura. However, the Lu family naturally wouldn’t invite a Mortal stage human to participate in such an operation.</p>
<p>Bida continued, “As a native of Sea Gazing City, my understanding of this area isn’t inferior to the Lu family’s. I even know some information that the Lu family doesn’t know. I can say with certainty that it’s impossible for them to find the break-out creature on the island.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>“If you are willing to cooperate with me, I will tell you why. Furthermore, I can lead you to the break-out creature,” Bida said.</p>
<p>“Since you know everything, why don’t you deal with that break-out creature yourself?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“If I had that ability, I wouldn’t be cooperating with you.” Bida paused for a moment before continuing, “If you don’t believe me, you can look for it and verify my words before working with me.”</p>
<p>“How do you want to cooperate?” Zhou Wen asked directly. He naturally knew that the break-out creature wasn’t on the island.</p>
<h3 id='chapter909'>Chapter 909: Egg</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Let’s work together to kill the break-out creature. After the matter is done, the benefits given by the Lu family will belong to you. If the break-out creature drops anything, it will belong to me. If nothing drops, I’ll just blame it on my bad luck,” Bida said.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, there’s no way we can cooperate.” Zhou Wen was mainly here for the Companion Egg that might drop. Helping An Sheng was only in passing, so it was naturally impossible for him to agree to such conditions.</p>
<p>Bida couldn’t help but be stunned. “Aren’t you satisfied with the Lu family’s Fiend Dust ores and priority purchase rights?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t explain as he constantly scanned the island with Truth Listener. Apart from Zhou Wen, the Zhang and Xia families and the free hunters were also using their own methods to search for the break-out creature.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they came up empty-handed like Zhou Wen. Some people began suspecting that the break-out creature wasn’t on the island.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and carried Ya’er towards the volcanic crater. If the break-out creature was really on this island, it could only be inside the volcano.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, are you really not considering it? The chances of a break-out creature dropping a Companion Egg are very low…” Bida tried persuading Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Since the chances of a Companion Egg dropping are very low, why are you trying your luck?” Zhou Wen asked casually.</p>
<p>“I don’t have the ability to kill the break-out creature, so I can only try my luck,” Bida said.</p>
<p>“Then there’s no other way. I also want to try my luck.” As the two of them spoke, they approached the volcanic crater. Many people had already gathered at the volcanic crater. Zhang Xiao and the Xia family were also here.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, their judgment was the same as Zhou Wen’s. They believed that the break-out creature was hidden in the volcano.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you think the break-out creature is inside the volcano like them?” Bida whispered to Zhou Wen, “No offense, but now that they believe that the break-out creature is inside the volcano, it’s the best opportunity for us to kill it. If we waste too much time, I’m afraid something unexpected will happen again.”</p>
<p>“I can’t agree to your conditions.” Zhou Wen stopped some distance away from the volcano.</p>
<p>The Zhang and Xia families had already used fire-elemental Companion Beasts to enter the volcano to search. Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to scan the volcano, but he didn’t find any traces of the break-out creature inside. Instead, he saw plenty of magma inside the volcano. It was an active volcano that was extremely unstable.</p>
<p>That break-out creature should have a spatial attribute, not a fire attribute. It shouldn’t be resting in the magma, right? Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Truth Listener had a hard time hearing the situation in the magma. Unless a Companion Beast was allowed to go down, it was very difficult to obtain results.</p>
<p>When Zhang Xiao and company saw Zhou Wen, they were somewhat nervous. Zhou Wen’s reputation was too resounding, and they knew how powerful he was. Amongst so many people, Zhou Wen had the greatest chance.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen remain unmoved, Bida gritted his teeth and said to Zhou Wen, “How about this? The items dropped by the break-out creature will be yours. The Lu family’s priority purchase rights towards Fiend Dust will also be yours. As for the portion of the Fiend Dust that is rewarded, I’ll only take 30%. How about that?”</p>
<p>“In that case, I can consider it,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“There’s no time to lose. Let’s hunt the break-out creatures while they are still searching the volcano,” Bida said.</p>
<p>“Alright, then we’ll do as you say. Apart from 30% of the Fiend Dust, everything else will belong to me. Do you have any objections?” Zhou Wen asked Bida.</p>
<p>“It can’t be helped. I don’t have the ability to kill that dimensional creature. I’ll just write it off as me selling information,” Bida said helplessly as he spread out his hands.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded and left the volcano with Bida.</p>
<p>After Bida led Zhou Wen away from the volcano, they passed through the forest and arrived at the shore on the other end of the island.</p>
<p>Bida walked along the coast for a while before stopping at a spot. He pointed at the coast below and said, “There’s a limestone cave below. We have to pass through the seawater. How’s your swimming? What about this child?”</p>
<p>“I’m from inland. I’m not good at swimming. Does that break-out creature live in water?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Not really. However, the karst cave has a long stretch underwater. If your swimming ability is good, it won’t be difficult to pass through. If you don’t know how to swim, you can only hold your breath and walk over,” Bida said.</p>
<p>“Then there’s no problem. Let’s go.” Zhou Wen carried Ya’er and walked towards the sea.</p>
<p>Bida got into the water first as Zhou Wen used the Black Tortoise’s Seven Mansion’s Essence Energy Skill. After entering the water, the seawater was isolated a foot away, preventing it from touching Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carried Ya’er and sank to the bottom of the sea. Indeed, he saw a black cave below. Bida had already swam inside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked along the bottom of the cave and followed behind Bida.</p>
<p>Bida was good at swimming, but Zhou Wen walked too slowly. All he could do was control his speed and lead Zhou Wen into the karst cave.</p>
<p>The underwater world was extremely magical, especially in the karst cave. There were all kinds of creatures and fish.</p>
<p>The Black Tortoise’s protective Essence Energy Skill had a certain ability to repel water. Ya’er curiously sized up the schools of fish. When she saw the fish approach, she extended her hand out of the Black Tortoise’s barrier, but she wasn’t stopped by it.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Although the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions’ barrier wasn’t of a high level, it was somewhat different from ordinary Essence Energy barriers.</p>
<p>The biggest difference was that it could be controlled freely. Typical Essence Energy barriers forcefully formed Essence Energy barriers, but the barrier formed by the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions’ Essence Energy Skills was different. It could be produced as he wished. Furthermore, it wasn’t just a simple barrier, but a liquid that enveloped his entire body.</p>
<p>The barriers of different Lunar Mansions had different attributes. For example, the Black Tortoise had the water attribute, the Vermillion Bird had the fire attribute, the Azure Dragon had the wood attribute, and the White Tiger had the metal attribute.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was still lacking an Essence Energy Skill. Without gathering the twenty-eight Lunar Mansion Skills, he didn’t know if it would have any special abilities in the future.</p>
<p>The underwater karst cave was winding and strange. As they didn’t travel in a straight line, they often had to pass through narrow gaps. Furthermore, Zhou Wen wasn’t walking fast. After more than half an hour, the two of them passed through the underwater karst cave and emerged from the water.</p>
<p>Outside the water surface was still a karst cave, but this karst cave was somewhat different from before. The karst cave here was like a crystal mine, filled with green crystals.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen quickly discovered that there was an egg half the height of a person in a cave surrounded by crystals.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me it’s the egg of that break-out creature?” Zhou Wen looked at the egg in surprise.</p>
<p>“I think it’s highly likely. Your luck is really good. I never expected that break-out creature to have an egg. This is a Mythical egg. Although it’s not a Companion Egg and can’t be incubated as a Companion Beast, such a dimensional creature can be easily tamed from a young age,” Bida said with envy.</p>
<h3 id='chapter910'>Chapter 910: Blue Sky Crystal Beast</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen looked around and didn’t find the break-out creature. There was only one egg in the crystal cave.</p>
<p>“How regretful. If I had known, I would have come alone to take the egg for myself. The value of this Mythical egg far exceeds the Fiend Dust,” Bida said regretfully.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as he walked towards the egg. As the dimensional creature inside hadn’t been born, it wasn’t dangerous.</p>
<p>He walked to the crystalline egg and reached out to lift it up.</p>
<p>This egg was much heavier than a rock. Although it wasn’t big, its weight was a little terrifying. If Zhou Wen wasn’t strong enough, he probably wouldn’t be able to lift it with one hand.</p>
<p>At the instant Zhou Wen touched the egg, he suddenly saw a spatial ripple appear beside him. It was a sign of a long-distance spatial teleportation.</p>
<p>Then, Zhou Wen saw a dimensional creature that resembled a Qilin rush out of the spatial ripples. Its glass-like body shimmered with resplendent light as it roared and pounced at Zhou Wen, its claws having the power to tear through the void. Before it reached Zhou Wen, the void in front of him had already cracked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated as he stuffed the egg into the Chaos Bead. At the same time, he quickly dodged the break-out creature’s attack.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth and blocked the break-out creature that continued charging at him.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth collided with the break-out creature’s force, producing a terrifying force that blasted the crystal cave apart. Immediately, large amounts of seawater poured down from above. This cave was actually underwater.</p>
<p>As for the people on the island, they suddenly heard a thunderclap-like rumble. Then, they saw an explosion in the seawater not far from the island. The water pillar rose dozens of meters and they immediately knew that something had happened.</p>
<p>Just as they were observing, they saw someone rush out of the water. First, it was Zhou Wen who was hugging Ya’er, followed by Tyrant Behemoth and the break-out creature.</p>
<p>The break-out creature pounced at Zhou Wen crazily. Tyrant Behemoth immediately brandished its fist to stop it, but before Tyrant Behemoth’s strength touched the break-out creature, it suddenly vanished and appeared above Zhou Wen’s head. Its sharp claws were about to touch Zhou Wen’s scalp.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen instantly vanished, causing the break-out creature’s attack to miss.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth chased after the break-out creature, but unfortunately, before it could catch up to it, the break-out creature had already teleported away and caught up to Zhou Wen who had just appeared from his teleportation.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for Zhou Wen’s excellent movement techniques and fast reflexes, he would have been torn into two the moment he appeared again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was wearing Dragon Scale Armor as he grabbed the middle of the Golden Battle God Halberd with one hand, blocking the terrifying claw.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The Golden Battle God Halberd was sliced into several pieces by the claw. Although Zhou Wen took the opportunity to dodge the strike, it was hopeless for the Golden Battle God Halberd.</p>
<p>It wasn’t easy for another Golden Battle God Halberd to drop, but it’s gone just like that. Zhou Wen felt his heart ache. In the past, he had disparaged the fact that the Golden Battle God Halberd dropped way too often, but now, he realized that it wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>The terrifying offensive strength of the break-out creature left Zhou Wen alarmed. If he wasn’t wrong, this fellow was likely proficient in spatial slicing skills. Typical Mythical weapons found it difficult to withstand spatial slicing. Otherwise, the Golden Battle God Halberd wouldn’t have been destroyed so easily.</p>
<p>I have to think of a way to get a weapon that’s indestructible in the future. Otherwise, there’s no way to guarantee that the weapon won’t be destroyed when facing some terrifying skills, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen dodged a few more attacks and didn’t dare clash head-on with the break-out creature.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, if you can’t do it, move aside.” Zhang Xiao had already led the White Crane team over.</p>
<p>“That’s what I was thinking. I’ll leave this fellow to you.” Zhou Wen’s figure flashed as he rushed to the back of the White Crane team.</p>
<p>Under Zhang Xiao’s command, the many Zhang family members on the white cranes struck out spirit talismans at the same time. There were many of them, instantly enveloping a large area of the sky and the break-out creature was caught in the middle.</p>
<p>Mysterious rays of light emitted from the spirit talismans. The rays intertwined and turned into a spirit energy net that trapped the break-out creature.</p>
<p>The break-out creature charged at the spirit energy net, but it failed to tear it apart. Instead, the spirit talismans stuck to its body, and the spirit energy net also bound its body.</p>
<p>When the break-out creature teleported, it couldn’t escape the spirit energy net. It could only teleport within the confines of the spirit energy net; it was ultimately trapped within when it appeared again.</p>
<p>Under Zhang Xiao’s lead, the members of the White Crane team circulated their Essence Energy Arts, causing the spiritual light on the spirit talismans to become stronger and stronger. The break-out creature seemed to be in extreme pain as it roared and attempted to tear open the spirit energy net, but to no avail.</p>
<p>The spirit energy net didn’t look like a real net. Instead, it appeared on the break-out creature like a tattoo. No matter how the break-out creature struggled, it was unable to escape.</p>
<p>“The Zhang family sure is impressive. That Essence Energy Art can actually combine different people’s Essence Energy Skills into one. It’s rather magical.” Zhou Wen felt like his horizons had been broadened. He had never seen such an Essence Energy Art or Essence Energy Skill before.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiao said coldly, “Don’t be ridiculous. How can you know everything of the Zhang family’s heritage?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as he watched the Zhang family fight the break-out creature.</p>
<p>The Xia family and the other freelance hunters came over as well. However, now that the Zhang family was fighting the break-out creature, it wasn’t appropriate for them to interfere.</p>
<p>Offending the Zhang family for a break-out creature and Fiend Dust was not worth it to most people.</p>
<p>However, not everyone had the same mindset. If the Zhang family couldn’t deal with the break-out creature and even ended up with an internecine outcome, they would be able to scoop up the benefits.</p>
<p>While everyone was watching the battle, someone arrived at the volcanic crater. He lowered his head and looked inside before carefully climbing down.</p>
<p>This person quickly arrived at the magma pool inside the volcano. It was none other than Bida, who had led Zhou Wen to seek out the break-out creature.</p>
<p>“Those idiots, let them risk their lives. Without them holding back the Blue Sky Crystal Beast, I won’t be able to obtain what’s down there.” Bida looked at the magma and summoned a Companion Beast. It was a Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle.</p>
<p>The Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle transformed into a full-body armor that enveloped Bida completely. Not a single part of him was exposed. Then, he walked towards the magma pool, looking like he wanted to dive into it.</p>
<p>“According to our agreement, everything except 30% of the Fiend Dust will belong to me. Don’t tell me you want to secretly take some treasure behind my back?” Just as Bida stepped into the magma pool, he suddenly heard a voice. His body trembled as he turned his head in surprise. Indeed, he saw Zhou Wen standing not far behind him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter911'>Chapter 911: Balrog</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Ahem, what are you doing here?” Bida retracted his foot and looked at Zhou Wen gloomily.</p>
<p>“We are partners. Of course I have to follow you,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>He hadn’t really been following Bida all this time. However, Zhou Wen had left Primordial Spore here as his informant when he first came to the volcanic crater. If it discovered anything here, he would be first to know.</p>
<p>To his surprise, he realized that Bida had sneakily come here. Zhou Wen felt that this fellow was somewhat odd from the beginning, so he used Truth Listener to listen carefully. He roughly knew what was happening, so he stopped him before he went down. He wanted to figure out what was beneath the magma.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I already help you find that break-out creature? Our cooperation is over. Why are you looking for me instead of killing it?” Bida said.</p>
<p>“You can’t say that. You used me to lure the break-out creature and people away. This means that we are still cooperating. I should have a share of the treasure here, right?” Zhou Wen said slowly.</p>
<p>Bida knew that it was impossible to shirk Zhou Wen off again. He gritted his teeth and said, “Alright, so be it. We’ll split the items below equally, but you have to go down with me and bring the items up.”</p>
<p>With that said, Bida wanted to walk into the magma.</p>
<p>“Wait. Tell me what’s down there first.” Zhou Wen naturally didn’t believe Bida’s words. He extended his Bamboo Blade and stopped him.</p>
<p>Bida suddenly threw a punch and struck the Bamboo Blade’s scabbard, causing it to tilt to the side before plunging into the magma.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the magma below and summoned the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to follow Bida, but he didn’t go down himself.</p>
<p>After the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General entered the magma, it immediately became excited. The purple flames in its body ignited as it ran rapidly through the magma, chasing after Bida.</p>
<p>“This fellow is really difficult to deal with…” Bida was somewhat depressed when he saw that the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was not afraid of the high-temperature magma.</p>
<p>It wasn’t easy for him to have a Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle Armor drop, allowing him to enter the magma layer. Yet, just any random Companion Beast of Zhou Wen’s could achieve the same effect, leaving Bida displeased.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Bida was very fast in the magma. The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was momentarily unable to catch up to him.</p>
<p>The deeper into the magma, the hotter it became. After a few hundred meters, the bottom suddenly became empty. After the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General rushed down, it realized that it was in magma. There was magma all around it without any support, but there was an invisible force that blocked out the surrounding magma. In the middle of the space, there was a black cocoon with magma patterns.</p>
<p>Through the thoughts transmitted by the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, Zhou Wen knew the situation there. His expression immediately changed. A Guardian cocoon. There’s a Guardian here? In that case, that break-out creature is actually protecting the Guardian cocoon.</p>
<p>I thought there was something good, but it’s actually a Guardian. Zhou Wen found it meaningless. He no longer needed a Guardian to advance his Life Soul, nor did he need the blood of a Guardian. Guardians were no longer of much use to him. At most, they were meant for killing.</p>
<p>Bida quickly rushed towards the Guardian cocoon. It looked like he was planning on trying to contract the Guardian here.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen made the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General halt and didn’t stop him from making the contract. Guardians would appear sooner or later anyway. Killing a Guardian without a contract was about the same difficulty as a contracted Guardian. It might even be easier to kill a Guardian after a contract, so there was no need to stop him.</p>
<p>Bida rushed to the Guardian cocoon and dripped his blood on it. Soon, the black-red Guardian cocoon absorbed Bida’s blood. Then, crimson magma cracks appeared on the cocoon. As the cracks spread, a fiend formed from magma rushed out.</p>
<p>“My name is Balrog. From today onwards, I’ll fight with you and pledge my life to follow you.” The magma on Balrog’s body splattered as he pressed a large hand on Bida’s head.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Balrog’s body transformed into magma that swept towards Bida’s body. Layer after layer of magma wrapped around Bida’s body, quickly turning into a magma armor. The terrifying fire-elemental power also filled Bida’s body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already unsummoned the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General and left the volcano.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Not long after Zhou Wen came out of the volcano, he heard a terrifying rumbling sound coming from the volcano. Then, he saw a scarlet pillar of fire rush into the sky with plumes of black smoke. The volcano had erupted.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiao and company, who were fighting the Blue Sky Crystal Beast, also noticed the situation on the volcano’s side. They didn’t know what had happened or why the volcano had suddenly erupted.</p>
<p>When Bida rushed out wearing Balrog armor, everyone’s hearts skipped a beat.</p>
<p>Greed was the original motivation for humans. Clearly, Bida was also a greedy person. After obtaining Balrog, Bida rushed out with the eruption of the volcano and charged straight at the Blue Sky Crystal Beast. Clearly, he wanted to snatch it.</p>
<p>The White Crane team members were all fighting the Blue Sky Crystal Beast with all their might, so they didn’t have the capacity to deal with Bida. Bida’s body carried magma-like flames that swept towards the Blue Sky Crystal Beast.</p>
<p>The Blue Sky Crystal Beast was trapped by the spirit energy net. It failed to dodge the terrifying flames even after teleporting as its entire body was ignited.</p>
<p>Even the Zhang family’s spirit talismans and spirit energy net were consumed by the flames.</p>
<p>The Blue Sky Crystal Beast lost the restriction of the spirit energy net and constantly teleported. It charged into the sea, hoping to use the seawater to extinguish the flames on its body.</p>
<p>However, after the Blue Sky Crystal Beast entered the sea, the flames on its body didn’t extinguish. It continued burning its body rapidly.</p>
<p>Bida had already rushed into the sea like a fire dragon, chasing after the Blue Sky Crystal Beast.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiao was peeved and furious. They had done so much, but they ended up benefiting another. However, the White Crane team wasn’t good at water battles. Looking at Bida’s might just now, they knew they probably didn’t have the chance of being the ones to take down the Blue Sky Crystal Beast today.</p>
<p>The Xia family and a few freelance hunters chased into the sea, but they quickly lost them. With their speed in the sea, they couldn’t catch up to the teleporting Blue Sky Crystal Beast and Bida.</p>
<p>Bida was also a strange person. He clearly cultivated a fire-elemental Essence Energy Art and contracted a fire-elemental Guardian, but he was surprisingly good in water.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Balrog didn’t seem to be afraid of water. Its flames could burn in the water without any obstruction.</p>
<p>The Blue Sky Crystal Beast constantly teleported. It wasn’t difficult for it to pull away from Bida, but the flames on its body couldn’t be extinguished. As the flames burned, the Blue Sky Crystal Beast’s vitality became weaker and weaker. The distance it could teleport became narrower and narrower, and eventually, Bida caught up to it.</p>
<p>Seeing that the Blue Sky Crystal Beast was already on the brink of collapse, Bida blasted out a magma-like fire dragon and devoured its already charred body. In a moment, its body was burned to ashes as a crystal dropped.</p>
<p>“Essence Energy Skill Crystal!” Bida was delighted and was about to grab the crystal.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a figure slid across the water. His posture was like a dragon or a wyrm, and he was even faster than Bida in the water. He snatched the Blue Sky Crystal Beast’s crystal before Bida did.</p>
<p>Bida was slightly taken aback. On careful look, he realized that the person who had snatched the crystal was Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you f*cking say that you are from inland and don’t know how to swim?” Bida wished he could slap Zhou Wen in the face. The finesse in water that Zhou Wen displayed was even better than his. To think that he had pretended to be a non-swimmer in the beginning. He was just too shameless.</p>
<h3 id='chapter912'>Chapter 912: Slaying Balrog</h3>
<p>“I originally thought that swimming was difficult, but it turns out it’s not that difficult.” Zhou Wen played with the crystal in his hand and said, “According to the agreement, this dimensional crystal should belong to me, right?”</p>
<p>“It’s yours. Everything is yours,” Bida said as he suddenly struck out with a hand. Terrifying flames transformed into a dragon’s roar as it charged at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen dodged and the flames landed at the bottom of the sea, turning it into a sea of fire.</p>
<p>“I’ve already given you the stuff. The partnership is over. Now I’m going to snatch them back. There’s nothing wrong with that, is there?” Bida said, looking at the huge fire at the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p>“No problem.” Zhou Wen nodded and summoned the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General again.</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was like a knight from hell as it stood in the deep sea fire. The purple flames in its armor also began burning.</p>
<p>“With both of them being fire-elemental, Balrog is supreme. You are too naive if you want to use a fire-elemental Companion Beast to fight me,” Bida said as flames spewed out from his body and swept towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General dashed forward without any hesitation. It did not dodge the flames that Bida blasted out and charged straight into the roaring magma and flames.</p>
<p>Bida was somewhat surprised to discover that Balrog’s flames did not burn the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to death. A shocking flame erupted from his body once again as the magma-like Balrog armor turned golden.</p>
<p>“I’ll show you the true power of fire.” Along with Bida’s voice, Balrog’s body had already turned into a sun. Terrifying flames instantly evaporated a large amount of seawater. The seawater in the distance also boiled from the heat. Large amounts of seabed sand and rocks turned into magma, making the seabed look like a magma-like hell.</p>
<p>Bida, who was emitting heat like the sun, threw a punch at the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, hoping to melt it into molten iron.</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General grabbed the two ends of the spear with both hands and blocked Bida’s fist. The terrifyingly high temperature on his fist made the spear appear like a red-hot iron pole or spear.</p>
<p>“Melt!” The temperature on Bida’s body rose again. He wanted to melt the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General directly.</p>
<p>Under the terrifying high temperatures, the armor on the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s body was burned red. However, the strange thing was that it was still emitting purple flames.</p>
<p>Bida originally thought that he could melt the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General into molten iron as long as he exerted more strength. However, he soon realized that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Balrog’s high temperature did not melt the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. Instead, the purple flames in its body became stronger.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General exerted strength with both hands and forcefully sent Bida flying. The ferocious tiger on the ground roared as it leaped forward. The burning spear carried purple flames as it stabbed towards Bida.</p>
<p>Bida was astonished. He used the various skills and abilities of Balrog to fight the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>Balrog was indeed ferocious. Its flames were different from ordinary fire-elemental powers as they had a burning effect. Upon contact, they would continuously burn until the opponent was burned to death.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Balrog’s flames didn’t purely rely on the flames. The most important thing was the high temperature. Even if one didn’t touch the flames, they would still be injured by the high temperature.</p>
<p>However, these abilities were useless against the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. This was because with the existence of the Tempered Steel Cauldron skill, the higher the temperature and the more intense the burning, the stronger the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General became.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Bida could still suppress the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General by using Balrog’s powers. However, through Bida’s efforts to burn it to ashes, he finally threw himself into a disadvantageous position.</p>
<p>What the hell is this Companion Beast? Bida had already discovered that something was amiss, but he still found it unbelievable. Not only was Balrog’s power unable to injure the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, it was instead used by the other party.</p>
<p>However, he had no choice but to believe the increasingly powerful Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. Bida knew that Balrog had met his nemesis and turned to run. He wanted to escape before considering anything else.</p>
<p>How could Zhou Wen let him do as he wished? He continued chasing.</p>
<p>Seeing that he couldn’t escape Zhou Wen in water, Bida fled towards the shore. After rushing to the shore, a circular hole similar to a rocket propeller appeared behind the Balrog armor. Demonic flames spewed out from it, pushing Bida’s body into the distance at a terrifying speed.</p>
<p>Bida rushed into the mountainous area and looked back. When he didn’t see Zhou Wen behind him, he heaved a sigh of relief and landed.</p>
<p>However, just as he landed on the mountaintop, he saw Zhou Wen riding a gigantic pangolin-like Companion Beast. He was looking at him from the opposite mountaintop.</p>
<p>Bida was extremely shocked, and he hurriedly used Balrog’s ejection force to shoot into the sky again before fleeing in another direction.</p>
<p>However, no matter how fast Bida was, every time he stopped, he would see Zhou Wen carrying Ya’er and riding the Companion Beast nearby.</p>
<p>After a few consecutive attempts, Balrog’s strength was almost exhausted. Bida was also on the verge of tears.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” After landing again and seeing Zhou Wen, Bida stopped running and shouted at him while panting.</p>
<p>“What I want to do is what you just said,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“What did I say?” Bida asked, gasping for air.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that our partnership has ended and you want to snatch the items back? This is also what I want to do,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You took the Blue Sky Crystal Beast’s egg and dimensional crystals. You took everything. What else do you want?” said Bida.</p>
<p>“And the Guardian on you,” Zhou Wen said calmly.</p>
<p>“You don’t cultivate a fire-elemental Essence Energy Art. Even if I give him to you, you won’t be able to contract him. Besides, I’ve already contracted him. I can’t give him to you even if I wanted to,” said Bida.</p>
<p>“That’s simple. Just kill him,” Zhou Wen said as he gripped his Bamboo Blade tightly, prepared to strike at any moment. With an additional Guardian in the world, the battle between Guardians would cause additional damage to Earth. He would kill one whenever he could.</p>
<p>“Then you might as well take my life. I’ll fight it out with you.” As Bida said that, he angrily pounced over from the sky. The Balrog armor on his body burst out with shocking demonic flames. Like the flames of a burning heaven, it covered the sky and descended.</p>
<p>Looking at Bida pouncing at him like a flaming giant, Zhou Wen’s expression didn’t change at all. However, his aura instantly turned terrifying.</p>
<p>The Bamboo Blade was unsheathed, followed by the release of Immortal Slaying’s might.</p>
<p>The demonic flames that filled the sky suddenly split into two. Zhou Wen’s figure appeared behind Balrog as though he had teleported. By then, Bamboo Blade had already returned to its sheath. When Bamboo Blade was fully sheathed, Balrog split into two in midair. Its body transformed into magma that scattered across the ground like piles of bonfires.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bida’s figure appeared in the sky. However, he no longer had the Balrog armor on him. Instead, a pair of crow-like wings appeared on his back. There was also a black mask that looked like a ghoul on his face. The aura from his entire body had become very strange.</p>
<h3 id='chapter913'>Chapter 913: Mirror Eyes’ Advancement Method</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned as he sized up Bida. This was because Bida’s aura had become extremely strange. Furthermore, this was the first time he had seen a human use a Guardian as a shield. He had screwed over the Guardian.</p>
<p>“Wang Mingyuan is right. You are indeed very powerful,” Bida said to Zhou Wen from midair.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Wang Mingyuan’s name, Zhou Wen’s pupils constricted slightly as he stared at Bida and asked, “Who are you?”</p>
<p>“Bida, the man who is about to become Yaksha King, remember this name.” As Bida spoke, the wings on his back flapped and a spatial rift opened in the void. He flapped his wings and retreated into the spatial rift.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched the spatial rift disappear, but it was too late to chase after him.</p>
<p>That fellow… He’s like Teacher… but he also seems a little different… Countless thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind. Although Bida had only displayed his true strength for a moment, he could sense the dual auras of a human and a dimensional creature. He was very similar to Wang Mingyuan and Yin Talisman King.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also knew that there were humans like Wang Mingyuan who had charged into different dimensions. He was very suspicious that Bida was one of the humans who had rushed into one.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to ask Bida what had happened to Wang Mingyuan, but unfortunately, Bida had already escaped through the spatial rift. It was impossible for him to catch up to him.</p>
<p>He returned to the Lu family with the Blue Sky Crystal Beast’s crystal and used it as evidence in exchange for the Lu family’s promise. Zhou Wen then asked Old Master Lu about Bida.</p>
<p>However, Old Master Lu told him that there was no freelance hunter named Bida in Sea Gazing City, and none of the people he invited were called Bida.</p>
<p>“But I did see him.” Zhou Wen drew Bida’s appearance for Old Master Lu to see.</p>
<p>Old Master Lu looked at it for a while before saying, “This is a freelance hunter from another city. I saw that he knew a lot about the habits of the break-out creature, so I invited him to stay. But his name is not Bida. He said his name is Ah Ye.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have any hopes of finding out anything else. After settling the matter here, he left Sea Gazing City.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao did not participate in the hunting operation this time. As she was exposed ahead of time, the overseas federation gave up on the plan and allowed her to go elsewhere as Xu Ai, so as to prevent the An family from suspecting the relationship between Xu Ai and Uesugi Nao.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to return to Luoyang, but before he left Sea Gazing City, another Guardian appeared on the rankings. The Guardian named Starry Night challenged the second-ranked Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched the battle and saw Starry Night standing in the void. The stars in the sky rained down like a meteor shower. After a bombardment lasting more than ten minutes, it nearly killed the Companion Beast. Finally, the latter had no choice but to forfeit and admit defeat.</p>
<p>More and more Guardians have appeared. I wonder how many there are? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>After taking second place, Starry Night didn’t continue the challenge. It seemed like it didn’t intend to fight the first Great Skyfiend.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen left Sea Gazing City and played with the Blue Sky Crystal Beast’s Essence Energy Skill Crystal on the way.</p>
<p>Blue Sky Crystal Beast: Mythical stage. Requires 41 Constitution, 21 Spatial Attribute, Spatial Essence Energy Art.</p>
<p>It’s 41 Constitution again. From the looks of it, I have to think of a way to raise Mirror Eyes to the Perfect Body as soon as possible so that my Constitution can reach 41. This way, I can absorb several Mythical techniques. Zhou Wen was somewhat helpless. Up to now, he still hadn’t found a way to advance Mirror Eyes.</p>
<p>However, although he wasn’t able to obtain a Blue Sky Crystal Beast Companion Egg during his trip to Gazing Sea City, he had obtained an egg. If he could hatch a baby Blue Sky Crystal Beast, he might be able to use it in place of a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen’s problem was that even if the baby Blue Sky Crystal Beast was born, he wouldn’t tame it since he didn’t know how to make it obedient.</p>
<p>I wonder if I can raise it like a Gu? Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen rode the Mighty Vajra Bull, he used his phone to grind the game dungeons.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen chose Deer Terrace Pavilion. He couldn’t kill the Nine-Tailed Fox inside, but it was different for the other Mythical creatures. Perhaps he could farm something good.</p>
<p>After farming all the dimensional creatures that he could, Zhou Wen went to challenge the Nine-Tailed Fox when there was nothing left.</p>
<p>At any rate, he had to refresh the instance dungeon, so he took the opportunity to test the Nine-Tailed Fox’s strength.</p>
<p>Just like last time, after killing the fox body, the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox did not die. Instead, it entered its Terror transformation form and became a beautiful demon consort.</p>
<p>Seeing the demon consort attack, Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he attempted to use Mirror Eyes to glance at her. To his surprise, his glance made the demon consort’s face turn into that of a fox.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because Mirror Eyes was still relatively weak, only her face had turned into that of a fox, and the rest of her body remained human.</p>
<p>Moreover, the face that had turned into that of a fox quickly recovered its devastatingly beautiful human features.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s disbelief, Mirror Eyes grew.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could get excited, he saw the screen turn black. The game was over. He had been too pleasantly surprised to notice how demon consort had killed the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>Mirror Eyes actually has the ability to see through things. From the looks of it, I have to use Mirror Eyes to see through the disguise of dimensional creatures that use transformation techniques to advance. I wonder if destroying a human’s transformation technique can allow Mirror Eyes to advance? Zhou Wen was somewhat excited after finding the method to advance Mirror Eyes.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>As long as his Constitution reached 41 points, he could absorb several Mythical Skill Crystals, and his strength would definitely improve greatly.</p>
<p>The most important thing was that he could absorb the Skill Crystal of the Blue Sky Crystal Beast. Perhaps that was a skill that could allow him to teleport indefinitely.</p>
<p>Where can I find dimensional creatures that can transform? Visiting the demon consort each time is too difficult. I’ll die every time I take a look. The advancement speed is just too slow. Zhou Wen couldn’t think of any dimensional creatures that were good at transforming, so he could only search for information online.</p>
<p>He never expected that there were actually quite a number of dimensional creatures that were good at transforming. Among them, the most common Fox Immortal in East District seemed to have a transformation skill.</p>
<p>How could I have forgotten about this? Aren’t there many lesser demons impersonating immortals on Deer Terrace Pavilion? Zhou Wen smacked his head and cursed himself for being foolish.</p>
<p>This couldn’t be blamed on Zhou Wen. This was because fake immortals like fox demons had always looked like immortals. He momentarily forgot about them.</p>
<p>He eagerly entered Deer Terrace Pavilion and used Mirror Eyes to look at the fake fairies and immortals. When Zhou Wen looked at an Epic fake fairy, she revealed her true form and turned into a fox. Zhou Wen immediately felt that the Mirror Eyes had grown.</p>
<p>Seeing that this move was indeed effective, Zhou Wen immediately looked around. Any lesser demon that was seen by Mirror Eyes was immediately reduced to its original form.</p>
<p>Although this would expend large amounts of Essence Energy, Zhou Wen could switch back to the Slaughterer Life Soul, giving him unlimited Essence Energy at any time. Then, he could switch back and activate Mirror Eyes.</p>
<p>As he swept his gaze and killed along the way, Mirror Eyes grew rapidly. It was only a matter of time before it broke through to the Evolved Body or even the Perfect Body.</p>
<h3 id='chapter914'>Chapter 914: Feng Qiuyan’s Weakness</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen had recently absorbed many Essence Energy Crystals. There was no lack of Mythical crystals. He felt that the Essence Energy Pill had reached its limits and was about to break through.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, every time he reached a critical moment, he couldn’t take that final step. It was as if something was missing.</p>
<p>What’s missing? Zhou Wen looked at the diamond-like Essence Energy Pill in front of him and frowned in thought.</p>
<p>What was lacking was clearly not energy, as the Essence Energy Pill’s Primordial Body had already absorbed quite a number of Mythical Essence Energy Crystals. Be it the quality or quantity of energy, they far exceeded the requirements needed for the Primordial Life Soul to evolve.</p>
<p>If it’s not lacking energy, why can’t the Essence Energy Pill evolve? Zhou Wen racked his brains over it but couldn’t figure it out.</p>
<p>Just as he was thinking, his phone suddenly rang. He took out his phone and realized that it was Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan seldom spoke, and even if he did, most people couldn’t understand what he was saying.</p>
<p>“Coach, thank you for your guidance. I’ve already overcome my weakness and have some achievements in my saber art. If you have the time, can you help me take a look at my saber art?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found Feng Qiuyan’s message baffling as usual. However, he was already used to it. He casually replied: “The earliest time for me to return to school is the day after tomorrow. I’ll look for you when the time comes.”</p>
<p>“I can’t wait. Coach, which path are you taking? I’ll find you,” Feng Qiuyan replied.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sent his route to Feng Qiuyan. Since he had nothing to do on the way, it wasn’t a bad idea to have someone welcome him.</p>
<p>After unsummoning the Essence Energy Pill, Zhou Wen continued grinding Deer Terrace Pavilion. The advancement of Mirror Eyes went very smoothly. At this rate, he could probably advance to an Evolved Body in a few days.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was gaming when he suddenly felt a tattoo on his body tremble. Before he could summon it, the Companion Beast automatically left his body.</p>
<p>“Neo, what happened?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise when he saw Demonic Neonate staring at a lake by the side of the road.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Food,” Demonic Neonate answered as she continued staring at the lake.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen really didn’t know what the food Demonic Neonate mentioned was because her diet was too strange. Even Guardians were treated as food by her—she was probably the only one that did so.</p>
<p>The lake by the side of the road wasn’t too big. Truth Listener’s senses could directly envelop it, but it didn’t discover anything amiss.</p>
<p>The lake was filled with ordinary creatures. There were quite a number of fish and shrimps, but there were no dimensional creatures. There were no dimensional zones nearby.</p>
<p>He looked at the map on his phone and realized that there was no sign of a lake here.</p>
<p>“Where’s the food?” Zhou Wen had no choice but to ask Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate extended her finger and pointed at the center of the lake.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen noticed that she was referring to the surface of the lake, not inside. Therefore, he narrowed his eyes and looked over.</p>
<p>In the middle of the lake was a bamboo pole. There was a scarecrow hanging on it.</p>
<p>“The food you mentioned is that scarecrow?” Zhou Wen pointed at the scarecrow and asked.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate nodded as she continued looking at the scarecrow.</p>
<p>As Demonic Neonate had already finished the Longevity Fruits she had previously obtained, she hadn’t eaten anything in the past few days. She was probably a little hungry.</p>
<p>“I’ll help you get it,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Dangerous.” Demonic Neonate shook her head and said seriously.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate seldom spoke to begin with. It was the first time he had heard her mention danger. He couldn’t help but seriously size up the scarecrow in the middle of the lake.</p>
<p>Looking at its body, there was nothing special about it. The scarecrow’s internal structure was made of straw—it could be clearly heard with Truth Listener. Apart from straw, there was nothing.</p>
<p>Apart from its straw body, it also had tattered clothes and a straw hat. It didn’t look anything special. The scarecrow was likely placed here in the past to prevent the shorebirds from eating the fish in the lake.</p>
<p>It had been here for quite some time. Its straw hat and clothes had already faded and rotted. Its straw body was also somewhat moldy. No matter how one looked at it, it was just an ordinary scarecrow.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate bit her lip and glanced at the scarecrow. She actually jumped back onto the Great Might Vajra Bull’s back and said, “Go.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed as he turned to look at the scarecrow. It was still standing there like a dead object, without any signs of being terrifying.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen believed Demonic Neonate’s judgment. He didn’t stay any longer and got the Great Might Vajra Bull to leave the lake.</p>
<p>After leaving the lake, Demonic Neonate looked back, clearly still having some thoughts.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Zhou Wen wanted to figure out what the scarecrow was.</p>
<p>“Food.” Demonic Neonate couldn’t explain it clearly either. She only said that it was food.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen secretly memorized this place to prevent himself from provoking the scarecrow when he passed by in the future. Something that even Demonic Neonate had some qualms about was definitely no trifling matter.</p>
<p>After walking for half a day, he suddenly saw a green bird flying at an extremely fast speed in the distant sky. Soon, it arrived above Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The huge green bird circled a few times before landing from the sky. A figure floated down. It was none other than Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>“Coach, I’m here.” Feng Qiuyan landed in front of the Great Might Vajra Bull. The green bird transformed into a tattoo and returned to Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>“You really didn’t waste a moment,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan said seriously, “After I overcame my weakness, my saber technique improved a little. Coach, I really want you to help me take a look at it, so I immediately rushed over.”</p>
<p>“Then let me see what improvement your saber technique has made.” Zhou Wen placed Ya’er on the back of the Vajra Bull and flew to the grass beside him.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan didn’t stand on ceremony as he summoned his Life Soul Saber and held it in his hand, preparing to attack.</p>
<p>“Hold on. You said that you overcame your weakness, so what do you think is your weakness?” Zhou Wen stopped Feng Qiuyan’s attack.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan said seriously, “I’ve thought about this problem for a long time. Although my saber art has many problems, those problems can be resolved through cultivation. Therefore, it can only be said to be a flaw, not a weakness. After much thought, I only have one weakness—loneliness.”</p>
<p>“Loneliness?” Zhou Wen didn’t understand what Feng Qiuyan meant.</p>
<p>“Yes, loneliness. This is because my saber art is a saber art meant for me to fight alone. Therefore, if I were to encounter experts of the same level ganking me, it’s very easy for me to lose due to a lack of stamina or from being overwhelmed,” Feng Qiuyan said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, Is this considered a weakness? If this is a weakness, then all creatures in this world have such a weakness.</p>
<p>“Then how did you overcome this weakness?” Zhou Wen was somewhat curious.</p>
<h3 id='chapter915'>Chapter 915: Infinite Saber Pilgrimage</h3>
<p>Feng Qiuyan answered, “Firstly, I have to resolve the problem of stamina and Essence Energy. This problem can be resolved with some skills that can recover Essence Energy. However, even if it’s a skill that can recover Essence Energy, it’s impossible to make a complete recovery. The expenditure of stamina is also a problem. Thankfully, after reading many manuals, I finally thought of a solution. It’s to use resources obtained in combat to support the combat.”</p>
<p>“How do you use resources obtained in combat to support the combat?” Zhou Wen knew what the phrase meant, but using resources obtained in combat to support the combat worked because there was time to regroup.</p>
<p>After a single person was surrounded, there was no time to regroup. How was he going to use resources obtained in combat to support the combat?</p>
<p>“First, I reduce my expenditure, then I snatch the enemy’s Essence Energy…” As Feng Qiuyan spoke, he waved the Life Soul Saber in his hand. The Life Soul Saber seemed to produce some strange magical power that sucked the nearby Essence Energy into the saber.</p>
<p>“You… That’s good…” Zhou Wen didn’t know what to say. This ability to devour other people’s Essence Energy was very rare.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had only seen Xia Jiuhuang use it before, and Feng Qiuyan was the second. He didn’t know how he had learned it.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan continued, “The second step is to resolve the problem of being ganked. For this, I spent a long time before coming up with a new saber art. Coach, please give me your advice.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s do it.” Zhou Wen was somewhat looking forward to Feng Qiuyan’s saber art.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan held the Life Soul Saber with an extremely solemn expression. After telling him to be careful, he raised his saber and slashed at Zhou Wen. The saber beam tore out like an invisible blade that cleaved down at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Although this strike was strong enough and much stronger than Feng Qiuyan’s saber techniques in the past, there weren’t any qualitative changes. Zhou Wen used Transcendent Flying Immortal and dodged Feng Qiuyan’s saber strike.</p>
<p>However, Feng Qiuyan didn’t care about that. He slashed out repeatedly, his saber beams pouring down like a surging river. Each strike was more ruthless and faster than the last.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had to admit that Feng Qiuyan’s saber art was indeed top-notch. If it wasn’t for him being restricted to the Epic stage, this saber art might have even had a chance of advancing to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan had completely shed his former naivety, hesitation, and lack of confidence. The saber seemed to have become one with him. He could be passionate and unrestrained, and he could also be calm like water flowing beneath a bridge.</p>
<p>Like being able to split a mountain with a single strike, yet also carve out flowers in tofu.</p>
<p>Fast and slow, light and heavy—everything was controlled adequately. When it was time to risk his life, he could unleash an infinite amount of power. When it was time to restrain himself, he could completely restrain his sharpness.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that if Feng Qiuyan continued practicing this saber art, his saber art would probably advance to the Mythical stage like his Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>However, no matter how Zhou Wen looked at it, he couldn’t tell how Feng Qiuyan’s saber art could deal with a group fight. His saber art only supported one-on-one combat.</p>
<p>That’s not right! Zhou Wen sensed something. When he used Transcendent Flying Immortal to dodge Feng Qiuyan’s attack, he switched to the Hell King Life Soul, allowing his eight senses to become extremely sharp.</p>
<p>I see. What an amazing fellow. Zhou Wen had already discovered the secret of Feng Qiuyan’s saber art.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan’s saber beams crisscrossed, each strike stronger than the last. After countless slashes, Feng Qiuyan suddenly retracted his saber and retreated. He stared at Zhou Wen with a sharp gaze and said, “Coach, you have to be careful.”</p>
<p>With that said, Feng Qiuyan held the hilt of his saber with both hands. The saber aura on his body was abundant, and his long hair and clothes fluttered with the saber aura.</p>
<p>The shattered saber beams from before rapidly condensed around Feng Qiuyan, condensing into complete saber beams that formed a huge saber array. All the saber beams pointed at Zhou Wen, densely packed together.</p>
<p>“What’s this move called?” Zhou Wen asked Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>“This was inspired from watching an ancient movie. I then added to it with my own research and modification. In the movie, that move is called Infinite Sword Convergence. I call this move Infinite Saber Pilgrimage.” Feng Qiuyan’s hand that held the saber began to tremble.</p>
<p>The Life Soul Saber in his hand was connected to all the saber beams. It was equivalent to carrying the power of infinite sabers.</p>
<p>Although it sounded a little exaggerated, there were still more than a thousand sabers.</p>
<p>“Do your best. Let me see how powerful this Infinite Saber Pilgrimage technique of yours is,” Zhou Wen said seriously.</p>
<p>“Coach, please be careful.” Feng Qiuyan couldn’t hold on any longer as he slashed at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>With the strength of his strike, dense saber beams descended like a river of sabers from the sky.</p>
<p>Dense saber beams rained down as Zhou Wen phased left and right in the saber river. Like a ghost, his figure left behind afterimages in the air. The saber beams slashed through the afterimages, but they failed to touch Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>The violent saber beams failed to touch his body. All of them flew over and slashed at the mountain rocks behind Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The mountain rocks that were dozens of meters tall were shattered by the dense saber beams, turning into countless fragments. However, Zhou Wen remained standing in front of the collapsed mountain rocks without suffering any damage.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan didn’t feel discouraged just because Zhou Wen had dodged his Infinite Saber Pilgrimage. Instead, he stared at Zhou Wen with a burning gaze. His mind was completely occupied by Zhou Wen’s movement technique for dodging the Infinite Saber Pilgrimage.</p>
<p>With the saber in hand, Feng Qiuyan stood there and stared at Zhou Wen. The aura that should have declined after the Infinite Saber Pilgrimage didn’t decline. Instead, it increased.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression turned solemn as he pressed his hand on the handle of Bamboo Blade.</p>
<p>When Feng Qiuyan’s aura reached its peak, he suddenly relaxed. The ferocious and domineering aura on him seemed to vanish, as though he had become an ordinary person. There was a strange smile on his face.</p>
<p>At that moment, Feng Qiuyan was like a pious believer. He wanted to use the saber in his hand to commemorate the holiness in his heart. Apart from being pious, Zhou Wen couldn’t sense any killing intent or evil aura from him.</p>
<p>It was as if he wasn’t holding a lethal weapon, but a holy artifact that consecrated gods.</p>
<p>Finally, the saber in Feng Qiuyan’s hand moved again. There was no domineering saber beam, nor was there a ferocious saber beam. Zhou Wen had never seen anyone use a saber art in such a clean and holy manner. It was very artistic.</p>
<p>It was as if he wasn’t killing, but completing a redemption.</p>
<p>Almost at the instant Feng Qiuyan unsheathed his saber, Zhou Wen’s hand that held the Bamboo Blade moved. Transcendent Flying Immortal didn’t have any mortal aura as it crossed Feng Qiuyan like an elegant immortal.</p>
<p>A saber hum that resembled a dragon’s roar lasted for a long time. If one were to carefully distinguish it, they would realize that the saber hum came from two different sabers. Bamboo Blade and the Life Soul Saber in Feng Qiuyan’s hands were trembling and humming.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>A saber mark split open on the Dragon Scale Armor across Zhou Wen’s chest. Almost at the same time, a saber mark appeared on Feng Qiuyan’s chest. On his exposed muscles, there was a thin line of blood that seeped out.</p>
<h3 id='chapter916'>Chapter 916: Fighting the Yin Talisman King Again</h3>
<p>“Congratulations on mastering a Mythical saber technique. It’s very strong,” Zhou Wen said sincerely as he looked at the shattered Dragon Scale Armor on his chest.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan put away his saber, but he shook his head and said, “Even though it’s a Mythical saber technique, I was still defeated. Coach, if you hadn’t retracted your saber in time, I would have been beheaded.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already sheathed the Bamboo Blade in his hand. He said with a smile, “It’s a draw. I’m wearing Mythical armor, so I knew that you couldn’t injure me, so I could consider retracting my saber. Otherwise, both sides would have suffered.”</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan still shook his head and said, “To be able to release and withdraw freely under such circumstances, Coach, you are indeed much stronger than me. I still need to continue working hard.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen blushed with shame. Feng Qiuyan’s strike already had the qualifications to match Transcendent Flying Immortal. However, other than Transcendent Flying Immortal, Zhou Wen also had Immortal Slaying. It made him accustomed to higher-level battles, so he still had the strength to react more under such circumstances.</p>
<p>In terms of saber arts, Feng Qiuyan’s strike was in no way inferior to Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>“That final strike shouldn’t be a part of the Infinite Saber Pilgrimage, right?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan said, “It wasn’t in the past, but it is now. This strike is the new Infinite Saber Pilgrimage. The Infinite Saber Pilgrimage before can just be considered a prelude.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have any concept of names to begin with. Feng Qiuyan could name anything he wanted, so he didn’t have any thoughts on it.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to return to Ya’er’s side, he suddenly heard a voice. “How exciting. Young men who aren’t even twenty can actually use such movement techniques and saber art. Is this era too powerful, or were the humans from the past too weak? How enviable.”</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen heard this voice, he immediately knew that something was amiss. He turned his head and saw the Yin Talisman King slowly walking over. He was clearly very far away, but with every step he took, he rapidly approached Zhou Wen and company. In a few steps, he was less than a hundred meters away from them.</p>
<p>“Yin Talisman King, you dare appear in front of me? Aren’t you afraid that it would infuriate The Thearch?” Zhou Wen glanced at the Yin Talisman King’s arm and saw that his severed arm had already recovered.</p>
<p>Yin Talisman King said with a sinister smile, “No matter how strong The Thearch is, she’s still trapped in a dimensional zone and can’t leave. As long as I don’t approach Chess Mountain, how can she do anything to me? Trying to use her to reel me in? Don’t be ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“Are you really that sure that she can’t come out of a dimensional zone?” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>However, Yin Talisman King said disdainfully, “Don’t try to scare me. The seal won’t be broken. Even if she’s a Calamity goddess, she can forget about rushing out of a place like Chess Mountain. Without that person today, I want to see who can protect you.”</p>
<p>With that said, Yin Talisman King appeared in front of Zhou Wen like a ghost. A crystal-like palm grabbed at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan didn’t hesitate to draw his saber and slash at Yin Talisman King. It was none other than the Infinite Saber Pilgrimage Technique he had just figured out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen lamented inwardly when he saw Feng Qiuyan take action. All he could do was draw his saber and slash at Yin Talisman King.</p>
<p>The two of them slashed at Yin Talisman King from both sides. They were extremely fast, but Yin Talisman King grabbed a saber with one hand. The sharp blade couldn’t even tear through the skin of his crystallized palm.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen released Bamboo Blade and struck Yin Talisman King’s head. Feng Qiuyan also retracted his Life Soul Saber and slashed at his waist.</p>
<p>Yin Talisman King turned slightly, threw away Bamboo Blade, and extended his hand to strike Zhou Wen. At the same time, he raised his leg and kicked Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Feng Qiuyan were sent flying almost at the same time. Zhou Wen shouted, “Split up and run!” Then, he spun in midair and flew to Ya’er’s side before rapidly flying into the distance.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan held back the churning blood in his chest and ran in another direction.</p>
<p>“This place is very far from Chess Mountain. You won’t be able to run there.” Yin Talisman King sneered as he chased after Zhou Wen. He almost instantly appeared behind him.</p>
<p>Seeing that he was chasing after him, Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate any further. He summoned Earth Elemental Beast and used Earth Escape several times.</p>
<p>The reason Zhou Wen didn’t use Earth Escape’s maximum distance was that he hoped that Yin Talisman King would chase after him and not chase after Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Yin Talisman King was very confident and had no intention of using Feng Qiuyan as a hostage.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The Earth Elemental Beast was in the midst of Earth Escape when it suddenly seemed to slam into an iron wall. It became dizzy from the collision and bounced out of Earth Escape. It sprawled on the ground and nearly fainted. A portion of its skull had shattered. From the looks of it, its injuries weren’t light as Zhou Wen unsummoned it.</p>
<p>Yin Talisman King chased after him with a smile. “If I wasn’t completely confident, would I have taken action? Even if immortals came today, they wouldn’t be able to escape either.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t answer as he summoned the Invisibility Cloak and used the three minutes of invisibility to escape this area.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to fly away, but he felt his body slam into an invisible barrier and rebound.</p>
<p>Yin Talisman King couldn’t see Zhou Wen, but he could hear the sound. He rushed over and said with a sinister smile, “It’s useless no matter how you struggle. Even if you turn into a ghost, you won’t be able to escape this area.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know how large the area was, so he stood there without moving. At the very least, he knew that there was an invisible barrier beside him.</p>
<p>Yin Talisman King couldn’t see him. All it could do was fly into the sky and look down at the entire forest. At the same time, it took out something as though it wanted to figure out Zhou Wen’s location.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t move as he activated his Mirror Eyes and looked at the invisible barrier, but he didn’t see anything.</p>
<p>After switching to the Supreme Hell King Life Soul, he looked at the invisible barrier again, but he still couldn’t see anything. Clearly, it wasn’t some kind of soul power.</p>
<p>If there’s a barrier in such a huge area, even a Terror-grade can’t do it with their own strength, right? With this in mind, Zhou Wen switched to the Dao Sutra and the Heaven-Opening Scripture appeared in his sea of consciousness. Then, he charged straight at the invisible barrier.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the Light Concealment Sword in his hand, but when the Light Concealment Sword touched the invisible barrier, it passed right through.</p>
<p>As expected. Yin Talisman King relies on the power of the Heaven and Earth laws to form such a powerful barrier. Zhou Wen rushed out of the barrier and immediately flew at full speed.</p>
<p>At the instant Zhou Wen rushed out of the barrier, Yin Talisman King sensed something as his expression changed. Damn it, how did he rush out of the Mystic Heaven Array?</p>
<p>However, very quickly, Yin Talisman King took out something that resembled a compass. There were many intersecting points and lines on it. After Yin Talisman King injected his Essence Energy, the compass pointed in the direction Zhou Wen had fled.</p>
<p>Yin Talisman King used Earth Escape to chase after Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen came out of invisibility, he was discovered by Yin Talisman King. All he could do was dodge with his movement technique and constantly pull open the distance with teleportation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the last time he had used fixed-position spatial teleportation was less than a month ago. He couldn’t use it again. It was almost impossible to shake off Yin Talisman King by teleporting a great distance.</p>
<p>As for the ten teleportation opportunities in a day, they were quickly expended. Earth Elemental Beast was severely injured and it’s mind was muddled, so it was impossible for it to help Zhou Wen escape.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t running towards Chess Mountain because it was too far away. It was impossible for him to escape.</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhou Wen had already fled, Yin Talisman King could also tell that Zhou Wen’s teleportation ability could no longer be used.</p>
<p>“Continue fleeing,” said Yin Talisman King coldly as he looked at Zhou Wen who had been chased to a lake.</p>
<h3 id='chapter917'>Chapter 917: Scarecrow</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen stopped and stood by the lake. He suddenly took out the purple bronze ball.</p>
<p>When Yin Talisman King saw the purple bronze ball in Zhou Wen’s hand, he slowed down and didn’t immediately rush over.</p>
<p>“This is what you want, right?” Zhou Wen asked as he slowly walked over.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen already knew the answer without needing Yin Talisman King to answer. This was because Yin Talisman King’s eyes were glowing when he saw the purple bronze ball.</p>
<p>“Give it to me and I shall give you a quick death. Otherwise, I’ll let you suffer so much that you’ll wish you were dead,” said King Yin Talisman.</p>
<p>“What’s this? Is it worth you risking your life to chase after me? You didn’t chase after the person who took away the Sun True Flame Furnace, but you chased after me for this. I believe this thing must be extraordinary, right?” Zhou Wen held the copper ball and slowly retreated. He had already retreated to the edge of the lake and was about to step into it.</p>
<p>Yin Talisman King was also sizing up his surroundings, especially the lake behind Zhou Wen. He didn’t dare underestimate Zhou Wen. Although it looked like Zhou Wen was unable to escape, Yin Talisman King was still very careful when Zhou Wen chose to stop here. He didn’t dare charge forward, hoping to figure out if there were any problems here.</p>
<p>Just like Zhou Wen, Yin Talisman King didn’t discover any problems. He believed that this was only an ordinary lake and that there was nothing special nearby. Therefore, he focused his attention on Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>In fact, this was where Zhou Wen had discovered the scarecrow. It was erected in the lake.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to know what this is. Where’s the other one?” Yin Talisman King asked.</p>
<p>“There’s two of these?” Zhou Wen saw that Yin Talisman King had already approached him. He suddenly flew up and flew across the lake.</p>
<p>Yin Talisman King tore through the air at a speed faster than Zhou Wen’s. He was just moments from grabbing Zhou Wen from behind.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly threw the purple bronze ball into the lake, and it landed near the scarecrow.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that Yin Talisman King would chase after the purple bronze ball first. If he approached the scarecrow, the scarecrow wouldn’t be indifferent.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, Yin Talisman King was more ruthless than Zhou Wen had imagined. He seemed to think that it didn’t matter even if the purple bronze ball fell into the lake. He could quickly return to retrieve it later.</p>
<p>Therefore, Yin Talisman King didn’t chase after the purple bronze ball. Instead, he continued attacking Zhou Wen, hoping to kill him first.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed, but he had also thought of this possibility. His body suddenly sank as he burrowed into the lake, allowing Yin Talisman King to rush past him.</p>
<p>The moment Zhou Wen entered the water, he switched to the Demon God Catalog and dived deep into the lake.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Yin Talisman King chased after Zhou Wen and rushed into the lake. He wanted to kill Zhou Wen quickly and not give him any chance of survival.</p>
<p>However, just as Yin Talisman King was about to rush into the water, he suddenly saw a strange scene.</p>
<p>Yin Talisman King had been paying attention to the purple bronze ball with a sliver of his mind. He needed to know where the purple bronze ball had landed so that he could search for it later.</p>
<p>However, before the purple bronze ball landed in the water, it suddenly changed its trajectory. Yin Talisman King saw the purple bronze ball land in the hands of the scarecrow on the lake.</p>
<p>The scarecrow that originally looked like an ordinary object was now holding the purple bronze ball in its moldy straw palm. It tilted its head and looked down at the purple bronze ball.</p>
<p>Yin Talisman King was alarmed. If the purple bronze ball was taken away, it would be useless even if he killed Zhou Wen. He immediately made a prompt decision and spun like a strange eagle, striking at the scarecrow with his palm.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that he would be in a bitter battle, but to his surprise, Yin Talisman King changed directions and charged at the scarecrow.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen lay in the lake and looked up at the scarecrow.</p>
<p>The scarecrow’s face was the same as the rest of its body. It was already moldy, but on its face—under the cover of the hat—was a pair of red eyes and a crescent-shaped mouth that emitted an evil red glow.</p>
<p>At that moment, the scarecrow was completely different from when Zhou Wen had observed it. It emitted a terrifying evil aura that resembled black demonic smoke. It rose from its body as though it was wrapping its body like its clothes and a hat.</p>
<p>One of Yin Talisman King’s hands had already slammed in front of the scarecrow. Yin Talisman King was clearly very careful. His entire body had turned into a crystalline state as he entered his Terror form. His hand was almost transparent.</p>
<p>Just as Yin Talisman King’s hand was about to strike the scarecrow’s head, the scarecrow finally looked up. The eyes and mouth that were covered by the brim of the hat were revealed to Yin Talisman King.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Yin Talisman King suddenly screamed as he retreated.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that Yin Talisman King’s eyes were like the eyes of a scarecrow, turning blood-red. Furthermore, the redness was still spreading around his eyes like protruding blood vessels. It made Yin Talisman King’s eyes look extremely strange. Furthermore, his eyes protruded and shimmered with red light. It gave off the feeling that his eyes were about to burst.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart trembled as he thought to himself that it was a close call. Thankfully, he thought that the scarecrow might be a dimensional creature like a demon. As for the Demon God Catalog, it had a bewitchment effect on such dimensional creatures. It made them mistake Zhou Wen for one of their kind, so he switched over.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, he had escaped a calamity. If not for the protection of the Mirror Eyes Life Soul in the Demon God Catalog, he would probably have suffered the same outcome as Yin Talisman King when he saw the scarecrow’s eyes.</p>
<p>Yin Talisman King was impressive as well. He gathered his strength with both hands and pressed it on his eyes that were about to burst. Two beams of Yin energy were injected into his eyes, forcefully suppressing the red light in them.</p>
<p>However, the red light didn’t disappear. It was suppressed and remained in his eyes, preventing him from opening his eyes to see.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Yin Talisman King used his ears as his eyes and listened in the direction of the scarecrow with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>The only one who could injure a Terror-grade was a Terror-grade creature. The scarecrow had nearly crippled his eyes. Clearly, it was also a Terror-grade creature.</p>
<p>However, the scarecrow had no intention of answering. Its body dissipated like black smoke as it silently condensed in front of Yin Talisman King. The finger that carried black smoke and demonic aura stabbed at Yin Talisman King’s blind eyes.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen thought that Yin Talisman King was about to be crippled, he suddenly saw a jade light on Yin Talisman King’s body glow. His palm was like a jade claw as it penetrated the scarecrow’s chest. He had actually discovered the scarecrow’s location.</p>
<p>However, the scarecrow didn’t seem to feel any pain. Its hand continued reaching out, wanting to grab Yin Talisman King’s neck.</p>
<p>Yin Talisman King raised his other hand and grabbed the scarecrow’s palm.</p>
<h3 id='chapter918'>Chapter 918: Soul Cage</h3>
<p>“Ah!” Another tragic cry came from the lake. Zhou Wen originally imagined that it would be the scarecrow, but to his surprise, he realized that it was Yin Talisman King.</p>
<p>Yin Talisman King’s hand had penetrated the scarecrow’s chest and grabbed one of its hands. However, the scarecrow stood in front of him expressionlessly. The Essence Energy in Yin Talisman King’s body quickly flowed into the scarecrow’s body.</p>
<p>Yin Talisman King wanted to shake off the scarecrow, but it seemed to be sucked in. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t shake it off. As for the scarecrow, it approached his body as though it was about to cling to him.</p>
<p>Boom! Zhou Wen saw an immortal glow circulate over Yin Talisman King’s palm. A strange symbol swirled in his palm and forcefully blasted the scarecrow’s body.</p>
<p>The scarecrow’s body slid across the lake like a skater, but its actions were extremely strange. As it contorted its body and slid towards Yin Talisman King, it reached out to grab at him.</p>
<p>Yin Talisman King and the scarecrow fought above the lake, but neither gained an advantage. If it wasn’t for the mysterious symbols on his hands that could restrain the demonic aura on the scarecrow, Yin Talisman King would have long been sucked dry by the scarecrow.</p>
<p>Even so, Yin Talisman King wasn’t having it good either. He couldn’t see, so he could only rely on his other senses to make up for his shortcomings. At the same time, he didn’t dare touch any other spot of the scarecrow.</p>
<p>The scarecrow was like an elegant figure skater. Its body moved strangely on the surface of the lake as it attacked Yin Talisman King in all sorts of elegant and strange poses.</p>
<p>The spot on Yin Talisman King’s crystalline Terror form where the scarecrow had touched immediately turned black, as though ink had seeped into his flesh.</p>
<p>What a terrifying scarecrow! Zhou Wen was alarmed. The powerful Yin Talisman King was actually suppressed to such a sorry state in front of the scarecrow.</p>
<p>Yin Talisman King’s Five-Elemental Escape technique didn’t seem to be of much use in front of the scarecrow. As he moved in the water, the scarecrow’s figure turned into black smoke and dissipated. By the time he escaped from the water, the scarecrow had already condensed beside him.</p>
<p>The two invincible existences at the Terror grade didn’t seem to erupt with earth-shattering strength, but their battle was extremely harrowing. If it were an ordinary Mythical creature, they probably wouldn’t be able to withstand a single strike and would die tragically.</p>
<p>Strength wasn’t purely based on one’s destructive power. Some forces might not look very destructive, but could lead to death upon contact.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to take the opportunity to escape, but after hiding in the water and peeping for a while, he dispelled the thought of immediately escaping.</p>
<p>Yin Talisman King was proficient in the Five-Elemental Escape technique. If he really wanted to escape, he could escape far away. It was likely that the scarecrow wouldn’t be able to catch up to him so easily.</p>
<p>However, Yin Talisman King only escaped in a small area and didn’t go far. It was obvious that he hadn’t given up on the purple bronze ball and wanted to snatch it back from the scarecrow.</p>
<p>In fact, the scarecrow only used one hand to fight. Its other hand held the purple bronze ball tightly. Clearly, it also valued the purple bronze ball.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen secretly summoned Demonic Neonate and hid in the lake with her, hoping to wait for an opportunity.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate’s large eyes sized up the scarecrow and Yin Talisman King. Clearly, she was also judging the situation and looking for an opportunity.</p>
<p>Although Yin Talisman King was suppressed by the scarecrow, his life wasn’t in danger. During the battle, Yin Talisman King was still shouting sternly, “Who are you? Are you a fiend? I was once a peer of the fiends’ Guardian…”</p>
<p>However, the scarecrow ignored him. It circled around Yin Talisman King like a ghost and attacked him, putting him in grave danger.</p>
<p>Seeing that Yin Dark Talisman King seemed to have the intention of retreating, Zhou Wen thought to himself, If I let him escape, I won’t be the scarecrow’s match. I’m afraid I won’t be able to retrieve the purple bronze ball. How can I stop Yin Talisman King from running and fight the scarecrow to an internecine outcome?</p>
<p>However, after some thought, there seemed to be nothing he could do. Unless he sealed off all the five elements when dealing with a person who was proficient in the Five-Elemental Escape technique, it was impossible to stop him from escaping.</p>
<p>Indeed, when Yin Talisman King realized that he couldn’t turn the tables and gradually couldn’t withstand the scarecrow’s attacks, he already had the intention to retreat.</p>
<p>After dodging the scarecrow’s attack, Yin Talisman King used Water Escape to reach the edge of the lake and leaped towards the shore. Half of his body had already touched the ground he wanted to escape through. He wanted to leave this place and wait for his injuries to heal before seeking revenge on the scarecrow.</p>
<p>However, Yin Talisman King’s expression suddenly changed. He felt as though a force that came from his soul was sucking at his soul, pulling him into the lake.</p>
<p>Just as Yin Talisman King had landed on the ground, he fell back into the lake.</p>
<p>“Soul Cage!” Yin Talisman King turned pale and couldn’t help but shout.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also saw an extremely strange scene. The scarecrow stood on the surface of the lake, its body wrapped in a black-robed demonic smoke, but its body made of straw emitted a soul-like holy brilliance.</p>
<p>The entire lake emitted a white soul glow like a holy lake.</p>
<p>Yin Talisman King rushed out of the lake, but a transparent shadow was locked inside. Then, Yin Talisman King’s body seemed to be pulled back by a rubber band.</p>
<p>The transparent shadow also fused with his body, and the scarecrow transformed into demonic smoke again and gracefully attacked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed as well. Taking advantage of their battle, he swam towards the bank, hoping to leave the lake.</p>
<p>However, just as he climbed ashore, he felt something in the lake affecting him, making him want to throw himself into the lake uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Could the Soul Cage that Yin Talisman King mentioned really imprison souls? Zhou Wen realized that Demon God Catalog and Mirror Eyes were useless, so he switched to the Supreme Hell King Life Soul.</p>
<p>The moment Supreme Hell King Life Soul appeared, Zhou Wen’s entire body transformed into a Hell King state. The force that was pulling him suddenly vanished as Zhou Wen finally rushed ashore.</p>
<p>When he turned his head, he saw that the lake wasn’t glowing at all. He couldn’t even see the lake. Countless bones sank to the bottom of the lake, and in the lake were countless wailing, struggling, and entangled wraiths. The lake was like a living hell, and the scarecrow that emitted demonic aura was the king of this purgatory.</p>
<p>Countless wraiths entangled Yin Talisman King’s soul. His body could leave the lake, but his soul was entangled by countless wraiths.</p>
<p>Some wraiths wanted to entangle Zhou Wen, but the moment they touched Zhou Wen’s Supreme Hell King body, they were immediately burned by invisible flames. One of their hands turned to ashes.</p>
<p>As for the invisible flames, they remained undying. They spread across the wraith’s body until it completely turned to dust before disappearing.</p>
<h3 id='chapter919'>Chapter 919: First Mountain Bronze</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>A wraith tried to pull Ya’er from Zhou Wen’s arms, but Zhou Wen casually waved his hand and reduced it to ashes.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate remained hidden in the lake and didn’t come out with Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen looked in surprise at where Demonic Neonate was and realized that the wraith-like objects didn’t entangle Demonic Neonate as though she didn’t exist.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate isn’t leaving because she probably thinks there’s a chance. There’s no harm in observing. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and hid in the nearby forest to observe the battle in the lake.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen realized that the wraith-like objects couldn’t leave the lake. It was as though there was a barrier outside the lake.</p>
<p>Could it be that the scarecrow can’t leave the lake? Zhou Wen guessed.</p>
<p>The last time he passed here, the scarecrow hadn’t attacked him. Back then, he had walked on a small path by the lake, less than two meters away from the lake.</p>
<p>Such a distance was probably nothing to a terrifying existence like the scarecrow. There were only two possibilities for it not to attack Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>One was that it didn’t want to attack, and the other was that it couldn’t leave the lake.</p>
<p>If the scarecrow really can’t leave the lake, there might be a chance of snatching the purple bronze ball back. Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, he suddenly heard Yin Talisman King’s voice.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, let’s make a deal. Help me leave the lake and I’ll help you contract the strongest Guardian.” Yin Talisman King was pleasantly surprised when he realized that Zhou Wen had rushed out of the lake.</p>
<p>What surprised him was that Zhou Wen was able to escape the lake. This person had always exceeded his expectations. He had lived for so many years, but he had never suffered such a huge loss at the hands of an uncontracted human.</p>
<p>He was naturally happy that Zhou Wen could escape the lake. This might be his chance of survival.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and shouted in the direction of the lake, “Tell me what that purple bronze ball is. What’s its use?”</p>
<p>As Yin Talisman King fought the scarecrow, he said, “That’s First Mountain Bronze.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be slightly taken aback when he heard the name First Mountain Bronze.</p>
<p>First Mountain Bronze wasn’t a name for a type of bronze. First Mountain was a name for a place. In myths and legends, Yellow Emperor went to First Mountain to mine bronze and cast a tripod cauldron to stabilize the light from providence that shone on China.</p>
<p>There were all sorts of theories as to where First Mountain was. Many regions claimed that it was the true First Mountain. Zhou Wen didn’t know which was true.</p>
<p>However, even if the legends were true, First Mountain Bronze was only a metal used to forge cauldrons. Was it worth it for existences like Yin Talisman King and the scarecrow to fight for it?</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you want to forge a tripod cauldron by snatching the First Mountain Bronze,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>King Yin Talisman was in a perilous situation after being attacked by the scarecrow. Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, he felt a little depressed, but he had no choice but to say patiently, “The true value of First Mountain Bronze isn’t because of the material itself. The so-called First Mountain isn’t really called First Mountain. It’s the place where Yellow Emperor and Chiyou deployed their troops to battle. Countless experts from both sides died. The blood of human immortals and demons dyed the mountain range red and soaked through the mountain’s bronze mine. The blood-stained bronze cauldron that Yellow Emperor made could suppress the light from providence for ages. What kind of treasure is that? Emperor Qin went through all the trouble to find First Mountain Bronze in hopes of using the human immortals and demons’ blood essence in First Mountain Bronze to refine the Elixir of Longevity.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, even after Emperor Qin passed away, the First Mountain Bronze couldn’t be refined. Instead, the blood essence in it became more and more condensed. It also absorbed the essence energy in the pill furnace and turned into two bronze balls. These two bronze balls can be said to be a kernel of the Elixir of Immortality, and they can also be said to be the strongest forging material for humanity.”</p>
<p>“Is that all?” Zhou Wen felt that Yin Talisman King hadn’t finished explaining the matter of First Mountain Bronze.</p>
<p>If that was the case, why would the scarecrow snatch it? It was immortal to begin with, and it couldn’t use tools forged by humans.</p>
<p>The situation on Yin Talisman King’s side wasn’t optimistic. His crystalline body was already tainted with the scarecrow’s demonic aura. He couldn’t last much longer.</p>
<p>“If you are willing to help me out of the lake, we can settle our past grievances. I can also help you refine the First Mountain Bronze. Only I know how to refine it…” Yin Talisman King attempted to convince Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I want to help you too, but I’m not capable enough to help.” How could Zhou Wen be willing to help Yin Talisman King? It would be good if such an old fellow died.</p>
<p>“Even if you don’t need to refine the First Mountain Bronze, you should still need a Companion Beast, right? I know where the Companion Beast used by Yellow Emperor Huang is. That Companion Beast has already returned to its Companion Egg form. With my help, you will definitely obtain it.” Yin Talisman King continued throwing out his chips.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was completely unmoved. He ignored Yin Talisman King’s nonsensical words and pretended not to hear him.</p>
<p>When Yin Talisman King saw that Zhou Wen clearly wanted him dead and that it was useless to say anything else, he immediately steeled his heart and didn’t waste his breath. Taking advantage of his remaining strength, he suddenly advanced and slammed into the scarecrow.</p>
<p>Inside the crystal jade-like body of Yin Talisman King, there were dark-gold mysterious symbols flowing. The mysterious symbols suddenly collided with something.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A golden beam shot into the sky like a nuclear explosion. It formed a huge golden mushroom cloud that blew up the entire lake.</p>
<p>The powerful shockwave shattered the nearby forest and caused the mountain walls to collapse.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth to block the blast. Truth Listener kept monitoring the battlefield as the scarecrow’s body scattered amidst the golden explosion.</p>
<p>However, it was different from what Zhou Wen had imagined. After the scarecrow’s body scattered, it transformed into countless wraiths. It was as though its body didn’t have any corporeal form—the straw was made of wraiths.</p>
<p>The wraiths closest to Yin Talisman King were disintegrated by the terrifying golden light. Many of them died.</p>
<p>A cold beam flew out of the explosion. After rushing out of the lake, it landed on the ground and vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that it was definitely a trump card that Yin Talisman King had kept close to his chest, but he didn’t have the time to stop him from escaping. By the time Zhou Wen rushed over, the cold beam had already fled into the distance. It was probably kilometers away.</p>
<p>Even this can’t kill him? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed as he turned to look at the lake.</p>
<p>The remaining wraiths in the lake were condensing towards a spot. There was a black core there, and all the wraiths were condensing towards the core. The numerous wraiths turned into a part of the outer core, gradually forming the scarecrow’s body.</p>
<p>Before it could condense into a scarecrow again, a black-purple sword beam flashed as Demonic Neonate’s demon sword pierced through the black monster core.</p>
<p>At the moment the monster core was pierced, the wraiths in the lake let out ear-piercing screams. Then, soul light brightly bloomed as wraiths rose into the sky amidst the light. The number was terrifying, and the scene was extremely spectacular.</p>
<p>After all the wraiths vanished into the sky, Demonic Neonate flew back to the bank with the purple bronze ball in one hand and the demon sword in the other.</p>
<p>The black monster core was still skewered to the demon sword. It was shaped like a walnut, but its texture was like obsidian. It also beat like a heart.</p>
<p>If not for Grim Demon’s power suppressing the monster core, it would have long fled.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could ask Demonic Neonate what it was, Demonic Neonate had already opened her mouth and bit off the monster core like she was eating from a skewer. After chewing a few times, she swallowed it.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter920'>Chapter 920: The Weapon Zhou Wen Likes</h3>
<p>Seeing Demonic Neonate swallow the scarecrow’s monster core, Zhou Wen opened his mouth, wanting to ask something, but he saw Demonic Neonate emit demonic aura as though she was about to evolve.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate leaped towards Zhou Wen and returned to him in the form of a tattoo. However, the tattoo was different from usual. It had already transformed into a blob of dense demonic aura that couldn’t be dispelled. It was impossible to tell its outline.</p>
<p>Is she finally going to be a Mythical? Zhou Wen was somewhat delighted. After this evolution, he might be able to find out the secret of Demonic Neonate’s Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I failed to kill Yin Talisman King. Zhou Wen glanced at the lake regretfully before leaving with Ya’er.</p>
<p>When he arrived at a place with a signal, Zhou Wen’s phone rang. It was a message from Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>“I’m in Taihang Mountain District. There’s a dimensional zone here that allows us to take refuge. Lure him here…”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen hadn’t seen the message. He had fled too quickly and there was no signal.</p>
<p>“It’s been resolved. I’m rushing back to Luoyang. Quickly return.” Zhou Wen sent him a message before rushing back.</p>
<p>Although he failed to kill Yin Talisman King, he was definitely severely injured. Even his body had self-destructed. It was difficult to say if he could recover his strength. It was unlikely he could return anytime soon.</p>
<p>If he dared to come again, Banana Fairy would probably have completed her evolution. When that happened, it would be difficult to say who would be the pursuer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can’t find him. Otherwise, this would be a great opportunity to eliminate him. Zhou Wen took out the purple bronze ball and played with it. Yin Talisman King had said that it was First Mountain Bronze and that it had absorbed the blood essence of the three races—humans, immortals, demons.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that it wasn’t as simple as Yin Talisman King had said. If it was the pure blood of ordinary humans, immortals, and demons, it wouldn’t be of much use even if he absorbed it. If it was really as Yin Talisman King had said, the blood absorbed by the First Mountain Bronze would probably be extraordinary.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen tried many methods, but he failed to figure out how to use it. No matter how he heated it, it only burned red. He could see a hint of purple flowing inside.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s possible to call such a huge bronze ball a pill kernel. If it’s really refined into a pill, it might be able to gorge someone to death. It’s more reliable using it to make weapons. This thing is so hard, so it definitely won’t be easily destroyed by weapons. However, if it’s so hard, it won’t be easy to turn it into a weapon. I can’t use a ball as a weapon, right… Wait… Zhou Wen suddenly thought of something and summoned his Essence Energy Pill.</p>
<p>I’ve been wondering if the Essence Energy Pill will advance into a pill or something in the future, but I neglected the fact that this thing is more like a weapon. If it’s a weapon, will it have a weapon form after advancing? Could it be that the reason the Essence Energy Pill hasn’t advanced is because it doesn’t have a fixed weapon form? The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that it was right.</p>
<p>The Life Soul was a fusion of bloodline talent and essence, vitality, and spirit. Its growth not only required energy, but also its master’s will.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have any special preferences for weapons. He could use any weapon. To him, weapons were just tools that he didn’t devote any feelings to.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that this was likely the reason why the Essence Energy Pill hadn’t advanced.</p>
<p>If it’s a weapon, what kind of weapon do I need? A saber, a sword, or a spear? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that they were about the same. Apart from the fact that he seldom used a spear, swords and sabers were basically the same to Zhou Wen. However, swords were mainly focused on thrusting, while sabers were more focused on slashing.</p>
<p>Since they’re about the same, I’ll choose the sword. Zhou Wen thought about the form of the sword before circulating the Qi Refinement Art again, hoping to advance his Essence Energy Pill.</p>
<p>However, the outcome was useless. At the final step, the Essence Energy Pill remained infinitely stable. It refused to break through.</p>
<p>Could I be wrong? The Essence Energy Pill doesn’t evolve towards weapons? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen returned to Luoyang, Feng Qiuyan had already returned ahead of time. As he had suffered some injuries, he was being treated at the hospital. He probably wouldn’t be able to return to campus for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>After visiting Feng Qiuyan, Zhou Wen returned to campus.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been considering the problem of the Essence Energy Pill along the way. He felt that his idea was correct, but for some reason, the Essence Energy Pill couldn’t evolve.</p>
<p>Could it be that I really have to like a certain weapon for it to be able to sense my will for evolution? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and decided to seriously study the various weapons to see if he could find a weapon he really liked.</p>
<p>The first weapon Zhou Wen learned about was the sword. It wasn’t because he liked swords the most, but because he had an Ancient Sword Tomb dungeon. There were all kinds of swords there, so Zhou Wen planned on taking a closer look.</p>
<p>After returning to his dorm, he opened the door and the chick flew over. It had grown a little bigger—from the looks of it, An Sheng had sent it quite a number of good things recently. It hadn’t starved.</p>
<p>The antelope lay on the couch and when it saw Zhou Wen return, it lazily opened its eyes and glanced at him before closing its eyes to continue sleeping.</p>
<p>This fellow eats and sleeps all day. Will its strength regress? Should I try to kill it and roast some venison skewers? Zhou Wen looked at the antelope and thought to himself.</p>
<p>However, this was only a thought. Zhou Wen suspected that this fellow was at the Terror grade. If they really fought, he might not be able to kill it.</p>
<p>After summoning Truth Listener and the other Companion Beasts that liked to play outside, he distributed the snacks he had brought back to the chick and got Ya’er to play with them. Only then did Zhou Wen return to his bedroom and lie in bed. He took out his phone and entered the Ancient Sword Tomb dungeon.</p>
<p>The vine sword was still stuck there. Every time he respawned, the location of the vine sword would be different. However, he could see it. Zhou Wen had tried many times to pull it out, but he failed.</p>
<p>This vine sword’s shape is too strange. It’s not the kind I would like. Zhou Wen looked at the vine sword before shaking his head and looking at the ancient sword beside him.</p>
<p>In the Ancient Sword Tomb, there were quite a number of beautiful ancient swords. Zhou Wen quite liked the shapes of some ancient swords, but no matter how much he liked them, he only treated them as tools. He had no way of developing the feelings that Feng Qiuyan had for sabers.</p>
<p>After circling the Ancient Sword Tomb for some time, Zhou Wen knew that it was impossible for him to be a swordsman who loved swords as much as his life. Therefore, he gave up on searching.</p>
<p>I should take a look at sabers. Perhaps I’m a natural saber user? Zhou Wen decided to change his train of thought.</p>
<p>It wasn’t as convenient to look at sabers as looking at swords. There were no instance dungeons like Saber Tomb, but in Sunset College, there was a showroom where many Essence Gold weapons were stored. Sabers took up a large potion of them.</p>
<p>Why did sabers take up the largest portion? That was because sabers were the most practical. While a sword had two sharp edges, making it seem to have more functions than a saber, this didn’t mean that it was better. A sword had high requirements for the craftsmanship and user. It wasn’t as simple and practical as a saber.</p>
<h3 id='chapter921'>Chapter 921: Practice Comes Before Saber</h3>
<p>As long as the showroom was open, the college’s students could enter freely with their student identification.</p>
<p>The moment the showroom opened, Zhou Wen swiped his student ID and entered.</p>
<p>There weren’t many students here usually, and it was still early. When Zhou Wen entered the showroom, the staff were still organizing the items. There wasn’t a single student.</p>
<p>Since he was already here, Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to look at the sabers. He looked at the first item on display.</p>
<p>What was displayed here were all Essence Gold weapons produced by humans after the dimensional storms. However, most of them were replicas for show.</p>
<p>Sabers were mainstream, followed by spears and bows. Swords and other weapons were non-mainstream. There were also shields and armor made of Essence Gold. However, there were very few of them because the effects weren’t very good.</p>
<p>Then, there were all kinds of Essence Gold bullets and firearms. Most bullets were gilded or mixed with a certain amount of Essence Gold. Pure Essence Gold bullets were relatively rare, and they were usually only assigned to high-ranking officers.</p>
<p>Rockets and shells were also made of Essence Gold, but they could only be used to attack large groups of dimensional creatures, so they weren’t suitable for ordinary battles.</p>
<p>Most of them were used to repel large-scale dimensional creature tides or deal with immobile plant-type dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>There were even more types of sabers. They could be as small as being only palm-length. The big ones were like Steed Slaying Saber. It left Zhou Wen dazzled. However, no matter how he looked at them, he felt that they were just tools without much difference.</p>
<p>In terms of something that was pleasing to the eye, they were inferior to the Bamboo Blade that Zhou Wen often used.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had already tried. Even though he was thinking about Bamboo Blade, he had no way of advancing the Essence Energy Pill.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me there’s no weapon that can make one fall in love at first sight?” Zhou Wen was somewhat helpless. He wasn’t a hot-blooded person to begin with. He really couldn’t see a weapon as something more important than his life.</p>
<p>No matter how good a weapon was, no matter how valuable it was, Zhou Wen would definitely abandon it when his life was at stake.</p>
<p>“Lad, there are no weapons in this world that can make you fall in love at first sight. There are only veterans that remain alive,” a staff member said when he heard Zhou Wen mutter to himself.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned his head and saw that the person speaking was a man in his forties. Although he was wearing sunglasses, Zhou Wen could tell that it was because one of his eyes was blind. One leg was a prosthetic limb.</p>
<p>“Can you elaborate on the meaning of that sentence?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>As the man wiped the weapons on display, he said, “Most people don’t really like weapons, but in times of danger, they need to use them to protect themselves and their families. Apart from a small number of people who like weapons, weapons are just tools to ordinary people.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded. He shared the same view as the man.</p>
<p>“But—” The man wiped a saber clean and carefully placed it on the saber rack. He straightened it and continued, “—once you pick up a weapon and fight with it, no matter if you love it or not, or no matter how much you despise it, it will become your most important companion. This thing is even more important than your woman or brothers. On the battlefield, it’s the only one you can truly trust.”</p>
<p>“That’s right.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>The man continued, “That’s why, on the battlefield, no matter if you like it or not, no matter how proud you are, you have to understand it and familiarize yourself with it. You have to constantly practice and get used to it. You have to put in more effort than chasing women. Otherwise, on the battlefield, it might take your life. If you want to become a veteran, you have to get along with it no matter how terrible it is. After some time, you will realize that the weapon is already a part of your body, a tool that can’t be easily abandoned. Because without them, your body seems to be missing a part, making you appear like a disabled person. The chances of a crippled person dying on the battlefield are naturally higher than a normal person.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen fell into thought when he heard the man’s words.</p>
<p>“Why do we have the verb ‘practice’ come before the noun ‘saber?’ Young man, practice well.” The man patted Zhou Wen on the shoulder and continued cleaning.</p>
<p>“Thank you. How should I address you?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I’m just a crippled veteran. My name isn’t important.” The man ignored Zhou Wen and continued his work.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a little upset. War had brought misfortune to most people. No one liked war, but sometimes, war was inevitable.</p>
<p>He didn’t continue looking at the exhibits because he knew very well that he wasn’t a person who liked weapons. Therefore, no matter how he looked at it, he couldn’t treat a tool as his life.</p>
<p>Just as the veteran had said, when it came to practicing sabers, practice was more important than the saber.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen already had an idea as he walked out of the showroom and prepared to return to his dorm.</p>
<p>Halfway there, he saw Li Xuan, Sadie, and Gulli walking towards the Xuanwen Club.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, what a coincidence. Where are you going?” Li Xuan greeted.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up when he saw Li Xuan. He went over and tugged at Li Xuan. “Come, practice with me.”</p>
<p>“No, you should find someone else. I’m dizzy. I won’t do…” Li Xuan held his chest as though he was about to faint.</p>
<p>He wasn’t afraid of being beaten, but he couldn’t accept being beaten into a deformed person by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Coach, what do you want to practice?” Sadie asked.</p>
<p>“I’d like to practice my sword technique,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“If you don’t mind, I can be your sparring partner,” Sadie’s eyes lit up as she said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s go to the training room.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>Sadie’s combat abilities were inferior to Li Xuan’s. If she really fought with her life on the line, she wasn’t Li Xuan’s match. However, in practice, she had the Eye of Odin. Her performance in combat was stronger than Li Xuan’s, making her more suitable as Zhou Wen’s sparring partner.</p>
<p>After all, with the Eye of Odin’s ability, Sadie could crack all sorts of moves in battle without risking her life like Li Xuan.</p>
<p>The four of them went to the training room together. Sadie picked up a sword.</p>
<p>There were two types of swords in the North District. One was a broadsword-type heavy sword, while the other was a narrow and thin armor-piercing sword. The two swords had their own specialties and their usage was completely different.</p>
<p>Sadie was originally good at armor-piercing swords. With her Eye of Odin, it was very easy for her to find the other party’s weakness and deliver a fatal strike.</p>
<p>However, ever since she came to Sunset College to study, Sadie had learned quite a number of East District sword techniques. Furthermore, she had fused the East District sword techniques into her own.</p>
<p>As she had never competed with a true East District sword expert, Sadie didn’t know how well she had mastered her sword techniques. When she heard that Zhou Wen wanted to practice, she wanted to test how well she had mastered her sword techniques.</p>
<p>The practice sword she chose was naturally the commonly seen armor-piercing sword in the North District. The blade was long and thin, much narrower than the swords from the North District.</p>
<h3 id='chapter922'>Chapter 922: Sword Practice</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen randomly chose a practice sword. It was the commonly seen three-foot-long sword in the East District. It was straight and light.</p>
<p>The type of sword was actually not important to Zhou Wen. He wasn’t planning to focus on a particular sword technique, but the thirteen sword techniques he had learned in the Peach Blossom Spring.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the sword stance wasn’t important. What was truly important was the three thousand sword intents.</p>
<p>After hearing the veteran’s words, Zhou Wen realized that the appearance of the sword wasn’t important. He needed to know what he could do with the sword.</p>
<p>“Draw your sword,” Zhou Wen said to Sadie.</p>
<p>Sadie didn’t hesitate as she stabbed out with her armor-piercing sword at lightning speed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen struck out at almost the same time. He was as fast as lightning, just like Sadie. They were both fast-attack sword techniques.</p>
<p>She won! Gulli saw Sadie’s sword reach Zhou Wen’s chest first. As for Zhou Wen’s sword, it was still a distance away from Sadie. He couldn’t help but be overjoyed and nearly jumped up.</p>
<p>To him, being able to defeat Coach once was something worth being happy about.</p>
<p>Sadie never expected to win. She found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>“Again.” Zhou Wen’s expression didn’t change as he retracted his sword.</p>
<p>After Sadie retracted her sword, she used the same move again. Zhou Wen did the same speed versus speed clash, but the outcome was the same. Sadie’s sword touched Zhou Wen first.</p>
<p>“Again,” Zhou Wen retracted his sword and continued.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had only memorized the three thousand sword intents, but he hadn’t actually practiced them. Now, Zhou Wen wanted to practice using the three thousand sword intents himself to truly understand the subtlety of the sword intents.</p>
<p>Sadie defeated Zhou Wen for a few consecutive rounds, but she was somewhat shocked.</p>
<p>Sadie had the Eye of Odin, so Zhou Wen’s actions looked like slow motion to her. Therefore, as long as her sword’s speed could keep up, Sadie could crack Zhou Wen’s sword techniques.</p>
<p>The same move against Sadie was almost doomed to failure. There was no chance of winning.</p>
<p>However, that wasn’t the case. Every time Zhou Wen unsheathed his sword, the sword technique seemed to become much stronger than before. It wasn’t just an improvement in technique and speed, but more importantly, the sword intent in his sword technique became stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>After more than ten strikes, Sadie had no choice but to use her movement technique to dodge Zhou Wen’s sword because her sword couldn’t hit him first anymore.</p>
<p>However, once she retreated, there was no chance of winning. Zhou Wen’s sword techniques accelerated with every strike. Soon, Zhou Wen’s sword pointed at Sadie’s chest.</p>
<p>“I lost.” Sadie was convinced of her defeat.</p>
<p>After more than ten strikes, Zhou Wen’s sword technique had actually improved greatly. It was unimaginable.</p>
<p>Just imagine a person who was easily defeated by you more than ten times. Then, after more than ten strikes, you were no longer their match. How terrifying was that?</p>
<p>However, Sadie wasn’t too surprised that such a thing had happened to Zhou Wen. Gulli and Li Xuan weren’t surprised either. This was because he was Coach. It wasn’t unacceptable that he could defeat Sadie.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen retracted his sword and seemed to ponder for a moment before saying, “Continue.”</p>
<p>Sadie didn’t know what was the point of continuing practicing. Zhou Wen’s fast sword was something she could see, but not dodge. There was no point in continuing.</p>
<p>However, since Zhou Wen wanted to continue, Sadie had no choice but to continue.</p>
<p>However, this time, Sadie realized that Zhou Wen’s sword art was different. This time, Zhou Wen’s attack wasn’t that fast or offensive. It seemed to have become a defensive sword art.</p>
<p>Strangely, the sword move Zhou Wen used was still the same.</p>
<p>The same sword move but with a completely different sword intent. The effects of the sword art seem to have completely changed. How did he do it? Sadie was somewhat surprised as she knew why Zhou Wen wanted to continue.</p>
<p>However, this time, Zhou Wen was quickly defeated. This was because he was focused on defending and counterattacking, but due to the existence of the Eye of Odin, it was very difficult to defend against Sadie’s attacks.</p>
<p>“Continue.” Zhou Wen’s expression didn’t change as he fought Sadie again.</p>
<p>After repeated failures, it became more and more difficult for Sadie to defeat Zhou Wen. Almost in the same manner as before, Sadie realized that she had no way of breaking through Zhou Wen’s defensive sword technique.</p>
<p>In the end, Sadie lost again.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen still wanted to continue. Furthermore, the sword art he used was still the same, but the sword intent had changed.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? Coach used a sword art with three different sword intents? How did he master it?” Gulli was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but from the looks of it, there are more than three types of sword intents,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Gulli was slightly stunned. “More than three? Are you joking? Mastering three or more sword intents for one sword art isn’t something a human can do, right?”</p>
<p>“He’s Zhou Wen,” Li Xuan said as he stared intently at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Just as Li Xuan had said, Zhou Wen didn’t just have three sword intents. In fact, it wasn’t a human sword art. The white-robed man from the Peach Blossom Spring was no longer human, so his sword art was naturally not a human sword art. Even the white-robed man couldn’t believe that Zhou Wen could memorize three thousand sword intents. It was obvious how unbelievable the sword art was.</p>
<p>“Four… Five… Six… Heavens… How many sword intents has Coach mastered?” Gulli felt like he was dreaming.</p>
<p>From the beginning until now, Zhou Wen had already used more than ten sword intents. He was basically beating Sadie in all kinds of fancy ways.</p>
<p>Regardless of which sword intent it was, it would gradually become stronger in Zhou Wen’s hands before defeating Sadie.</p>
<p>Sadie felt terrible, but at the same time, she was very excited. She was also a sword practitioner. To be able to face so many types of sword intents was of great help to her. Her understanding of the sword deepened as her sword techniques became stronger.</p>
<p>However, the speed at which she became stronger clearly couldn’t keep up with Zhou Wen. As Zhou Wen used different sword intents, Gulli was already dazzled. He couldn’t remember how many sword intents Zhou Wen had used.</p>
<p>“Is this fellow really human?” Gulli looked at Zhou Wen as though he was looking at a monster.</p>
<p>“Without a doubt, Zhou Wen is physiologically human. Since he can do it, it means that this path is feasible,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if this path will work. In any case, I won’t be capable of doing it. Besides, there’s no need for that, right? Just cultivating a single sword intent to the extreme is enough to defeat an opponent. Why do you have to cultivate so many different sword intents?” Gulli gave up. He had seen so many sword intents and felt that his mind was in a mess.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen naturally has his reasons for doing so. I haven’t figured it out yet,” Li Xuan said seriously.</p>
<p>“Forget it. Take your time. Anyway, I’m only a human. I won’t get involved with monsters like you guys.” Gulli felt that he had come to the wrong place.</p>
<p>In the past, when he was in the Ultimate Family Clan, he was still considered a genius. Apart from existences like Lance and Sadie, he was always basking in the limelight.</p>
<p>However, ever since he had entered the Xuanwen Club, he felt like he had entered a perverted concentration camp, and he was one of the more normal ones.</p>
<h3 id='chapter923'>Chapter 923: Sword Pill</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>For the next couple of days, Zhou Wen practiced with Sadie. He wanted to practice all three thousand sword intents to see which sword intent was suitable for the Essence Energy Pill. Perhaps that would be the time when the Essence Energy Pill advanced.</p>
<p>After he was discharged, Feng Qiuyan surprisingly didn’t practice his saber for the next few days. He came to watch the two fight every day.</p>
<p>Sadie went from initially surprised to the subsequent shock and finally numbness. She no longer thought about anything. All she did was focus on taking in the battle with Zhou Wen and use the Eye of Odin to record the battle.</p>
<p>She didn’t wish to master so many sword intents like Zhou Wen, but as long as she could master a few sword intents that suited her, she could make great progress.</p>
<p>In fact, Sadie did the same as Zhou Wen. During the battle with him, she gradually infused her insights into her sword art.</p>
<p>Perhaps even Sadie didn’t realize that her sword art was undergoing a tremendous change thanks to Zhou Wen’s influence.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen powered the 13 stances using the Qi Refinement Art to constantly gain insight into the 3,000 sword intents, but the Essence Energy Pill showed no signs of advancing despite him gaining insight into all the sword intents.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush as he continued practicing. Without realizing it, he had already practiced all three thousand sword intents.</p>
<p>After using the last sword intent, Zhou Wen sheathed his sword and stood there motionless.</p>
<p>When Sadie saw Zhou Wen suddenly retreat, the sword in her hand stabbed at him. However, before the sword could plunge into him, Sadie found herself unable to do so.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen seemed to be standing there casually, but his body seemed to emit infinite sword intent.</p>
<p>It was different from any of the previous sword intents. Every sword intent Zhou Wen had used previously had distinct characteristics. They were either firm or soft, offensive or defensive, fast or slow, domineering or kingly. Every sword intent had its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>However, the sword intent emitted by Zhou Wen was completely different.</p>
<p>Sadie couldn’t figure out what the sword intent on Zhou Wen’s body was. All she felt was an infinite sword intent surge from Zhou Wen’s body. It was indescribable, like a sword furnace.</p>
<p>Sadie felt that no matter how she struck out, she would receive Zhou Wen’s fatal counterattack. However, if she retreated, she would similarly be pursued. Instantly, she was petrified as cold sweat constantly seeped out of her forehead. She stood motionless, as though she would be killed by Zhou Wen if she moved.</p>
<p>Hum!</p>
<p>A sword hum sounded from Zhou Wen’s body, but the practice sword in his hand had already shattered.</p>
<p>The sword hum lasted for a long time, but no sword appeared. It was as though the sword was inside Zhou Wen’s body, and Zhou Wen was like a sword furnace that had fused with the swords in the world.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted. The Essence Energy Pill had finally advanced to an Evolved Body. Its Essence Energy had been further purified and compressed, becoming smaller and purer. However, it didn’t transform into a sword form. It was still an Essence Energy Pill.</p>
<p>However, the Essence Energy Pill contained infinite sword intent.</p>
<p>After the Essence Energy Pill advanced successfully, the sword hum on Zhou Wen’s body vanished. The boundless sword intent also vanished.</p>
<p>Sadie’s entire body was drenched with sweat. When the sword intent vanished, Sadie’s legs went limp as she fell to the ground, panting heavily.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan, who was watching from the side, wiped the cold sweat from his forehead. Although he wasn’t facing the boundless sword intent like Sadie, he could sense how terrifying it was.</p>
<p>“Sorry, are you alright?” Zhou Wen asked Sadie, who had fallen to the ground.</p>
<p>Sadie shook her head slightly, but there was a smile on her face. “Coach, don’t say that. I should be thanking you. If not for the past couple days of practice, I wouldn’t have been able to comprehend the true Sword Dao and find my true path. I should be thanking you.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you’re fine.” Zhou Wen took out his phone and glanced at the Essence Energy Pill Life Soul.</p>
<p>Sword Pill (Evolved): Heaven and Earth as a furnace, Essence Energy as a sword, three thousand swords fused in one pill.</p>
<p>There’s still one last step, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>With Sword Pill completed, Zhou Wen didn’t need to continue sword practice. He hadn’t thought of a way to advance Sword Pill. All he could do was continue absorbing Essence Energy Crystals, allowing Sword Pill’s Essence Energy to constantly strengthen, purify, and compress in wait for the opportunity to advance to a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Mirror Eyes, on the other hand, had finally advanced to the Evolved Body after he continuously revealed the demons for what they were.</p>
<p>The evolved Mirror Eyes still only strengthened the eyes, but the name changed.</p>
<p>Eyes of Legacy (Evolved): Demon God Eyes of Legacy.</p>
<p>The introduction was very simple. Zhou Wen had obtained very little information during his evolution, but after some experiments, he finally knew what use the Eyes of Legacy had. Furthermore, its use left him pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>The Eyes of Legacy had inherited the Mirror Eyes’ ability to see through demons. At the same time, it had another function. Zhou Wen could use the Eyes of Legacy to scan dimensional creatures before taking on the guise of a dimensional creature.</p>
<p>This transformation wasn’t purely an illusion. It was more like a replica. For example, Zhou Wen could scan and transform into Torch Dragon Youngling. After transforming, Zhou Wen had a body that was identical to Torch Dragon Youngling. He also had various abilities and skills. He was like a replica of Torch Dragon Youngling.</p>
<p>It was a very powerful and terrifying ability, but the problem was that using the Eyes of Legacy to transform into Torch Dragon Youngling required a large amount of time and Essence Energy to scan Torch Dragon Youngling’s body. Furthermore, it required a large amount of Essence Energy to support the transformation. After transforming, he would also expend a large amount of Essence Energy to maintain the Torch Dragon Youngling form.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s present Essence Energy, he couldn’t even scan and transform into Torch Dragon Youngling. All he could do was temporarily transform into some Epic dimensional creatures or lower. Furthermore, this required a certain amount of scanning time.</p>
<p>If only Slaughterer Life Soul could be used together with the Eyes of Legacy. With infinite Essence Energy, I’ll be truly invincible if I can scan a powerful dimensional creature at the Terror grade, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this was impossible at the moment. Different Life Souls couldn’t be used at the same time. And if he switched Life Souls, the Eyes of Legacy’s transformation would vanish.</p>
<p>How can I use multiple Life Souls at the same time? Zhou Wen had been considering this problem, but he couldn’t find a solution.</p>
<p>To use different Life Souls, he had to switch to different Essence Energy Arts. It was naturally impossible for different Essence Energy Arts to be circulated at the same time.</p>
<p>Is it possible to simulate two Essence Energy Arts at the same time? Zhou Wen had made similar attempts in-game, but he had failed.</p>
<p>Simulating two Essence Energy Arts at the same time was like an ordinary person cultivating two Essence Energy Arts. It would immediately cause a conflict and destroy Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I can only wait until I advance to the Mythical stage to see if there’s a possibility of using multiple Essence Energy Arts. Zhou Wen had no choice but to temporarily give up on the idea of using multiple Essence Energy Arts at the same time.</p>
<p>Time passed as Zhou Wen practiced. Soon, it was time for him to meet The Thearch.</p>
<h3 id='chapter924'>Chapter 924: Theft</h3>
<p>There are only a few days left before the appointment with The Thearch. I need to prepare. Zhou Wen thought about his trip to another dimension to steal something.</p>
<p>The reason he agreed to The Thearch wasn’t entirely because he wanted her blood essence. Zhou Wen also wanted to go to the dimension to see what had happened there and why Wang Mingyuan wasn’t under the divine tree.</p>
<p>Although The Thearch said that she had already arranged everything, and that there would definitely be no danger as long as he followed her plan, Zhou Wen didn’t believe in absolute safety, so he had to make preparations.</p>
<p>As it was too dangerous, he definitely couldn’t take Ya’er with him. After all, her body wasn’t strong. Even if her body could keep up with her mental strength, she was only at the Mythical stage. The Mythical stage was only a bottom feeder in the dimension. It was too dangerous.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen explained his trip to the dimension to Ya’er and got her to stay at Ouyang Lan’s place for a few days. He would pick her up when he returned.</p>
<p>Ya’er finally nodded in agreement. Seeing that she didn’t show any signs of violence, Zhou Wen felt relieved to leave her alone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen called Ouyang Lan in advance and she happily agreed. She even urged Zhou Wen to take Ya’er over as soon as possible.</p>
<p>On the day of departure, Zhou Wen took Ya’er over before heading to Chess Mountain alone.</p>
<p>He came in front of Chess Mountain’s mountain wall again and saw the flower on it. Zhou Wen said, “The Thearch, I’m here for the appointment. Now, you can tell me what I should do, right?”</p>
<p>The flower twisted the flower bud towards Zhou Wen and said, “It’s very difficult for humans to cross the dimensional barrier to reach the dimension. Therefore, you need a lot of preparation work.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it very easy to reach there through the cube?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“It’s different. The cube is equivalent to an official door. It’s naturally easy for you to enter through the main door. However, if you want to steal something, it’s naturally impossible for you to walk through the main door. You have to climb over the wall or dig a hole to enter. The difficulty is naturally different. Just like Wang Mingyuan previously. He used the power of the six Holy Temples to successfully break through the dimensional barrier. If you want to enter, you have to do it without anyone noticing. The difficulty is even greater.”</p>
<p>The Thearch paused and said, “However, with me around, this isn’t a difficult task. At most, it will be a waste of time. However, after you enter the dimension, you have to be careful. Apart from acting according to the plan, if you encounter an emergency, you have to resolve it yourself. Remember, don’t use force unless it’s absolutely necessary. Your combat strength is too weak there.”</p>
<p>With that said, The Thearch opened the mountain wall and allowed Zhou Wen to enter Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>This was the second time Zhou Wen had entered Chess Mountain in real life. He was very familiar with everything here, but he had seen a cartoon version in-game. It had a beautifying effect that masked the more sinister and terrifying appearance in real life.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen walked into Chess Mountain, The Thearch explained what Zhou Wen needed to do and the steps to take.</p>
<p>The process wasn’t complicated, but the problem he encountered was troublesome. Zhou Wen entering a dimensional zone to steal things was no different from a child entering a pack of wolves to steal their wolf cubs. If he was discovered, the chances of survival were slim.</p>
<p>When The Thearch explained the plan to Zhou Wen, he confirmed that The Thearch wasn’t Nine-Tailed Fox. This was because to enter the dimension, he had to use the bronze tripod that chained the Nine-Tailed Fox.</p>
<p>The Thearch got Zhou Wen to use some means to fool the Nine-Tailed Fox, allowing him to borrow the power of the bronze tripod. If the Nine-Tailed Fox was The Thearch, there was no need to go through so much trouble.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from his previous visit to Deer Terrace Pavilion and the actions of The Thearch this time, she didn’t have much control over the interior of Deer Terrace Pavilion. She seemed to be different from the dimensional creatures inside.</p>
<p>What’s her background? Among the people related to Deer Terrace Pavilion, other than the three demons, what other women are there? Zhou Wen thought about it but couldn’t figure it out.</p>
<p>According to The Thearch’s plan, Zhou Wen went to the ancient building on Deer Terrace Pavilion and killed the fake immortals on the first level. He got a few jars of alcohol and entered the lower level of Deer Terrace Pavilion through a secret tunnel in the ancient building.</p>
<p>So the passageway to Deer Terrace Pavilion is here. Only then did Zhou Wen know the true way to enter the lower level of Deer Terrace Pavilion. Previously, he had relied on the Earth Elemental Beast to enter.</p>
<p>With The Thearch’s guidance, Zhou Wen circled most of the dangerous areas. Along the way, he killed some dimensional creatures that appeared.</p>
<p>When he arrived at a spot that Zhou Wen had never been to in-game, he placed the jars of alcohol in front of a stone door. Then, he pushed open the stone door by a sliver and immediately hid.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen saw a tiny, white beast crawl out from the crack in the door. It was a ferret-like creature. It looked around intelligently and discovered the opened wine jar on the ground. Its eyes immediately lit up as it rushed towards it.</p>
<p>In a short while, the tiny beast finished one jar after another. After it finished the last jar, it was extremely drunk. It curled up in the jar and fell asleep.</p>
<p>Seeing that the time was ripe, Zhou Wen tiptoed to the stone door and slowly pushed it open. He looked back at the little beast and saw that it was still sleeping soundly in the wine jar. Zhou Wen quickly walked in.</p>
<p>Behind the stone door was a huge hall. There were four statues consecrated in the hall. These four statues looked different from ordinary statues. They were more like generals in the human world and not immortals in heaven. Not only were they wearing armor, but their faces were extremely ferocious.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen still remembered The Thearch’s words as he looked at the third statue.</p>
<p>The statue looked ferocious like a general from a demonic realm. He held a strange umbrella in his hand. There were many pearls embedded in the umbrella, and on it were the words “Cosmic Bag.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tiptoed to the statue and carefully flew to the side of the pearl umbrella. He reached out and pressed down on a pearl before gently tapping on it three times.</p>
<p>The pearl dropped by itself. Zhou Wen hurriedly caught it and quickly left the door. He glanced at the sleeping white beast and quickly left.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief as The Thearch’s voice sounded in his mind. “Well done. Now, take the pearl to the bronze tripod cauldron and give it to the Nine-Tailed Fox. It won’t stop you from using the bronze tripod. Remember, after you enter the dimension, you only have 36 hours. Once the time is up, the bronze tripod’s passageway will automatically close. When that happens, your chances of survival will be very slim. You have to steal the bell in 36 hours.”</p>
<p>“Got it. Are you sure there won’t be any problems with the place the tunnel opens up to?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“There won’t be any problems there. Don’t worry,” The Thearch said with certainty.</p>
<h3 id='chapter925'>Chapter 925: Crossing Dimensions</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen followed The Thearch’s instructions and arrived near the bronze tripod. The Nine-Tailed Fox immediately woke up and glared at Zhou Wen as though it would pounce at him at any moment.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly held the pearl he had taken from the umbrella in his hand. When the Nine-Tailed Fox saw the pearl, its ferocious look immediately vanished as it stared at the pearl.</p>
<p>Seeing the Nine-Tailed Fox extend its head, Zhou Wen threw the pearl at it.</p>
<p>The Nine-Tailed Fox swallowed the pearl and stared at Zhou Wen. “Human, why are you doing this?”</p>
<p>“I want to borrow the bronze tripod cauldron to teleport to the dimension.” Seeing the Nine-Tailed Fox acting as The Thearch had said, he felt much more at ease.</p>
<p>“On the account that you brought the Stabilizing Bead to me, I can let you use the bronze tripod. However, why are you going to the dimension as a human? Are you sick of living?” the Nine-Tailed Fox asked with a seductive voice.</p>
<p>“I want to find someone in the dimension,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Who?” the Nine-Tailed Fox asked again.</p>
<p>“Emperor of Shang,” Zhou Wen answered according to The Thearch’s instructions.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s answer, the Nine-Tailed Fox’s mesmerizing eyes lit up as it stared intently at Zhou Wen and asked, “Why are you looking for him?”</p>
<p>“Emperor of Shang is an imperial lord of our human race. He has the supreme glory of the human race and is the person I respect the most. The reason I’m looking for him is firstly to see the Emperor’s face, and secondly, to learn some skills from him. I hope to bring glory to my human race…” Zhou Wen said the lines he had thought of.</p>
<p>In order to think up these lines, Zhou Wen had lost quite a bit of hair.</p>
<p>The Thearch only gave him a general outline of how to communicate with the Nine-Tailed Fox. She told him to try his best to praise Emperor of Shang, but Zhou Wen had to fill in the details himself.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t good at praising others to begin with. It wasn’t easy for him to come up with such phrases. It was unknown how many brain cells he had lost in the process.</p>
<p>When the Nine-Tailed Fox heard Zhou Wen, its expression gradually softened. It looked at Zhou Wen and said, “You are a mere human. You will probably die very soon after entering a dimensional zone. How will you be able to see Emperor of Shang? Forget it. On account of the fact that you gave me the Stabilizing Bead, I’ll lend you something. Take it with you, and you’ll still stand a chance. Return it to me when you return.”</p>
<p>“How can I accept this?” Despite saying this, Zhou Wen was delighted deep down.</p>
<p>He originally thought about how he could trick the Nine-Tailed Fox into giving him the item like The Thearch had said. He never expected the Nine-Tailed Fox to take the initiative to offer it to him.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to be embarrassed about. If you see Emperor of Shang, help me pass a message to him,” said the Nine-Tailed Fox.</p>
<p>“No problem. As long as I can see him, I’ll definitely deliver the message. If I can’t see him, there’s nothing I can do.” Zhou Wen paused before saying, “What message do you want me to deliver?”</p>
<p>The Nine-Tailed Fox fell silent for a moment before slowly saying, “Think not.”</p>
<p>“What?” Zhou Wen was momentarily confused.</p>
<p>“Do you need me to carve it on your face?” the Nine-Tailed Fox asked Zhou Wen coldly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly recalled and said, “There’s no need. I got it. It’s just ‘think not,’ meaning think not of something, right?”</p>
<p>The Nine-Tailed Fox glanced at him coldly but didn’t say anything. It opened its mouth and spat out something. It was a pearl that was as crystalline as the moon.</p>
<p>“Take it with you. It can conceal your human aura, and it can also prevent most dimensional creatures from hating you. However, if you encounter a Terror-grade dimensional creature, it’s best you hide far away. If you encounter a Calamity-grade god, kill yourself to avoid suffering,” the Nine-Tailed Fox said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out to catch the pearl. It was warm to the touch and emitted a fragrance like perfume. He hurriedly put it away.</p>
<p>“Come in. I’ll send you there. Remember the message. If you forget it, you won’t have a chance of survival when you return,” said the Nine-Tailed Fox.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. As long as I don’t die, I’ll definitely deliver the message,” Zhou Wen said as he jumped into the bronze tripod.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen the bronze tripod cauldron many times in-game. He originally imagined that it was a tool to suppress the Nine-Tailed Fox, but he never expected it to have the ability to traverse dimensions.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen entered the bronze tripod, the Nine-Tailed Fox stood up, tightening the chains. At the same time, its body emitted a demonic glow as terrifying Essence Energy seeped into the bronze tripod through the chains, causing it to emit a strange luster. The mysterious runes on it lit up.</p>
<p>“Remember, you only have 36 hours. You have to return before the time is up. Otherwise, you will be trapped in the dimension forever.” The Nine-Tailed Fox’s voice entered Zhou Wen’s ears.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt the world spin as a huge vortex formed in the cauldron, sucking him in.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly switched his Essence Energy Art to a Civilized Country. After all, it was a spatial teleportation. It should be able to strengthen Civilized Country to a certain extent.</p>
<p>As the spatial vortex spun, Zhou Wen suddenly made a connection. Was this feeling the same when flushing the toilet?</p>
<p>The dizziness continued. Zhou Wen could sense that his body seemed to be teleporting, but the teleportation was taking a little too long.</p>
<p>At that moment, the energy in Civilized Country constantly increased. The speed at which it grew far exceeded Zhou Wen’s imagination.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seriously underestimated the difficulty of teleporting into the dimension. He had been to the dimension using the cube, so he felt that it wasn’t a big deal.</p>
<p>However, in fact, entering the dimension through the cube was completely different from sneaking into the dimension. The difficulty was incalculable, and the teleportation method was completely different.</p>
<p>It could be said that the energy needed to teleport 10,000 times using a cube wasn’t even comparable to the energy needed to sneak into it once.</p>
<p>Back then, Wang Mingyuan had used the power of the six Holy Temples to break through the dimensional barrier. How much terrifying energy was that?</p>
<p>Although the bronze tripod wasn’t forcefully breaking through the dimensional barrier and didn’t expend that much energy, it was far from what ordinary spatial teleportation could compare with.</p>
<p>After a long period of dizziness and loss of control, Zhou Wen didn’t know how long he had been teleporting because he wasn’t able to judge time and space. In any case, it felt extremely long.</p>
<p>Plop!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt himself fall into the water as his body gradually returned to normal.</p>
<p>What left him pleasantly surprised was that Civilized Country had obtained unimaginable energy during the teleportation process. Now, Civilized Country was about to break through to a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>What an unexpected gain. From the looks of it, I just need a few more teleportations to advance to a Perfect Body. Zhou Wen was delighted.</p>
<p>After floating out of the water, Zhou Wen wanted to see where he was, but the scene he saw made his expression turn odd.</p>
<h3 id='chapter926'>Chapter 926: Teleportation Mistake?</h3>
<p>It was a liquid pool that suffused blue light. Outside the pool was a volcano-like ring-shaped mountain.</p>
<p>If this was really a volcano, the liquid in the pool should be magma. However, the liquid in the pool suffused blue fluorescence. The temperature wasn’t high, and it was even somewhat cold.</p>
<p>And at the bottom of the pool, there were many crystals, as though they were arranged together.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was observing the crystal-like objects, he suddenly saw the blue liquid in the pool spew out like a volcanic eruption.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly leaned against the stone wall and watched the blue liquid spew out. At the same time, a large number of crystal-like objects were ejected.</p>
<p>The blue liquid then landed back into the crater.</p>
<p>After the crystal-like objects came into contact with the air outside, they immediately produced a special chemical reaction. The crystal-like objects rapidly transformed and quickly turned into foxes. The foxes’ eyes suffused blue light as they fell from the sky.</p>
<p>These foxes… Why do they look like the fox demons in Deer Terrace Pavilion… Zhou Wen found it odd as he secretly crawled to the volcanic crater and looked out.</p>
<p>With a glance, he was alarmed. He saw that there were no plants on the black primitive land. Black smoke billowed in the sky as black ring-shaped volcanoes covered the land.</p>
<p>From time to time, a ring-shaped volcano would erupt. However, what spewed out wasn’t magma, but liquid of different colors.</p>
<p>Some of the liquids were blue like this one, some were red, and some were yellow. There were all sorts of colors. Similarly, every time a volcano spewed out liquid, a portion of the crystals would randomly be ejected.</p>
<p>Once the crystal-like objects left the liquid and came into contact with the air, they rapidly transformed into different dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Red centipedes with wings danced in the air as hundred-meter-long serpents roared into the sky. Groups of demons ran amok on the ground. Most of these creatures were creatures Zhou Wen had never seen before, but there were also some he had seen before.</p>
<p>For example, the foxes spewed out from this volcano were Epic Fox Immortals in Deer Terrace Pavilion.</p>
<p>The volcano beside him spewed out gray porcupines which Zhou Wen had seen in Deer Terrace Pavilion. It was also an Epic demon-type dimensional creature.</p>
<p>This… Could it be a place where dimensional creatures are born? Zhou Wen looked at the volcanoes erupting everywhere as large numbers of different dimensional creatures spewed out. The spectacular scene was indescribable.</p>
<p>A nearby fox seemed to discover Zhou Wen. When he saw it look over, Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>However, the fox didn’t show any hostility towards him. It seemed to treat him as one of its kind as it yelped at him.</p>
<p>Could it be… Zhou Wen thought of the pearl the Nine-Tailed Fox had given him.</p>
<p>He crawled out of the volcano. The fox demons nearby had discovered him, but they had no intention of attacking him. This relaxed Zhou Wen significantly.</p>
<p>I never expected this thing to be so useful. However, my human appearance is just too eye-catching. I have to think of a way. Zhou Wen looked around.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen realized that there were many snow cats gathered near a nearby volcano. It was a Legendary dimensional creature. Zhou Wen walked over.</p>
<p>The snow cats only looked at him without any intention of attacking. Zhou Wen immediately switched to the Demon God Catalog and scanned a snow cat with the Eyes of Legacy.</p>
<p>As the scan proceeded, Zhou Wen felt a strange power flow out of his eyes. This power passed through his meridians and spread throughout his body, causing his body to undergo a strange change.</p>
<p>Not long after, Zhou Wen turned into a snow cat. He looked no different from the snow cats beside him. The snow cats seemed to treat him as one of their kind and didn’t even look at him.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Lightning streaked across the black smoke-filled sky. The dimensional creatures that were struck by the lightning immediately vanished.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was in a daze, large swaths of lightning descended. The snow cats and the nearby fox demons vanished when they were struck.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly ran and dodged the lightning’s attacks. He could sense the power of space from the lightning. It didn’t seem to be real lightning, nor was it ordinary lightning. Instead, it was some kind of spatial lightning.</p>
<p>This is a little different from what The Thearch said! Zhou Wen ran with all his might before escaping the area covered by lightning. Wherever the lightning passed, the nearby dimensional creatures just vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen remembered very clearly that The Thearch had told him that after he teleported to the dimension, he was to walk towards a tower.</p>
<p>However, all Zhou Wen saw were ring-shaped volcanoes. There were no towers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen had never heard The Thearch mention the void lightning.</p>
<p>Could it be that the Nine-Tailed Fox got the wrong place when it teleported me here? That’s not right either. Didn’t The Thearch say that the bronze tripod’s teleportation only has one destination? Zhou Wen saw a huge ring-shaped volcano nearby and wanted to climb to the top to see if there was a tower in the distance.</p>
<p>He didn’t dare fly randomly to avoid being targeted. He still didn’t know where he was, nor did he know if there was any danger here.</p>
<p>However, no matter how he looked at it, this place was somewhat different from the dimension The Thearch had mentioned.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Halfway through his climb, the huge volcano suddenly erupted. Red liquid shot into the sky like a heavenly pillar. At the same time, a red crystal-like object spewed out.</p>
<p>However, this red crystal pillar was much bigger than the blue crystal pillar Zhou Wen had seen before. It was about half the size of a soccer field.</p>
<p>The red liquid receded. After the crystal-like object came into contact with the air, it immediately transformed. When the huge red crystal-like object landed, it had already transformed into a fire qilin that was as red as crystal and emitted terrifying flames.</p>
<p>The snow cat’s body was like an ant beside the fire qilin.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, this place can even spew out Mythical creatures! Zhou Wen retreated step by step. He was too close to the fire qilin. He was afraid that it would discover that he was human. That would be terrible.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of ordinary Mythical creatures, he didn’t know if he would be targeted by an even more terrifying existence if he fought the fire qilin here.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the fire qilin didn’t notice Zhou Wen. Perhaps in its eyes, the snow cat was similar to an ant. There was no need for it to care.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The fire qilin walked towards the lightning, causing the ground to tremble. Soon, it walked into the lightning and gradually vanished under the bombardment of the void lightning.</p>
<p>What the hell is this place? Zhou Wen eagerly rushed to the top of the volcano. He wanted to see if there was the tower mentioned by The Thearch nearby.</p>
<h3 id='chapter927'>Chapter 927: Discovered</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>After climbing to the volcanic crater, Zhou Wen looked around. All he could see was billowing black smoke that enveloped the sky and volcanoes.</p>
<p>Looking around, there was only one place that was slightly different. In between the volcanoes, there was a mountain that resembled a heavenly pillar. Its height far exceeded that of ordinary volcanoes, piercing through the black smoke that enveloped the sky. One couldn’t see the end of the mountain.</p>
<p>Could the tower The Thearch mentioned be that mountain? Zhou Wen thought to himself. However, no matter how he looked at it, it was only a special mountain. It was somewhat different from a tower.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had nowhere else to go. All he could do was rush towards the huge mountain.</p>
<p>Could it really be a teleportation error? Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss, but how could the bronze tripod cauldron that had a fixed destination make such a mistake?</p>
<p>He ran across the land in the form of a snow cat. From time to time, dimensional creatures would spew out from the volcano. Before long, void lightning would make the dimensional creatures vanish.</p>
<p>Could it be that the lightning is a spatial rift that leads to Earth? The dimensional creatures on Earth all pass from here? Then, if I’m struck by lightning, will I be able to return to a dimensional zone on Earth? Zhou Wen kept thinking.</p>
<p>If a legendary mistake really happened, he had to think of a way to return. Otherwise, if a human were to be discovered by the dimensional races in such a place, it would be no different from courting death.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there didn’t seem to be any particularly powerful creatures here. They were dimensional creatures that spewed out from volcanoes. They were mostly Mortal and Legendary creatures, and relatively fewer Epic creatures. Occasionally, there would be one at the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>If there aren’t any more terrifying and powerful existences here, it’s a good place to grind. However, although there are many dimensional creatures here, they all have the characteristics of demons… Zhou Wen observed as he walked. The Truth Listener earring constantly scanned his surroundings.</p>
<p>The pillar-like mountain was too far from where Zhou Wen was. The closer Zhou Wen was to it, the more majestic the mountain was.</p>
<p>Thankfully, with the Nine-Tailed Fox’s pearl and Eyes of Legacy, the dimensional creatures that spewed out of the volcano didn’t attack Zhou Wen, saving him a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>It took Zhou Wen nearly three hours to approach the mountain. The bronze tripod’s passageway could only last for thirty-six hours. If he didn’t discover anything, Zhou Wen planned on returning via the original path.</p>
<p>He sized up the mountain that was very close, but he didn’t discover anything. There were no dimensional creatures nearby, nor were there any traces of the void lightning.</p>
<p>As for the volcanic eruptions, Zhou Wen had no idea if it was a volcano because he couldn’t see beyond the black smoke above.</p>
<p>He constantly scanned the mountain but failed to find anything. Zhou Wen hesitated for a moment before deciding to climb up to take a look. If he didn’t find anything, he could return the way he had come to avoid being trapped in this godforsaken place.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked around and didn’t find any dimensional creatures nearby before climbing up the mountain.</p>
<p>He used the snow cat’s body to quickly jump on the mountain rocks. This was because not only was the mountain huge, but it was also especially steep. The mountain wall was inclined at almost 90 degrees, so Zhou Wen could only use the cracks on the rocks or the protruding spots as a foothold.</p>
<p>The snow cat didn’t have the ability to fly, so Zhou Wen didn’t use it to avoid being discovered.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to reach the mountainside, Zhou Wen discovered a protruding platform. He landed on it and planned on resting to condition himself.</p>
<p>However, after landing on the platform, he realized that there was a cave behind the platform. In the dark cave, there was a pair of eyes staring at him.</p>
<p>This wasn’t something Zhou Wen sensed, he could really see a pair of eyes. They emitted a blue glow, making them stand out in the dark cave.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the owner of those eyes was slowly walking out of the cave.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed when he saw the eyes staring at him. He was about to summon Truth Listener’s earring to sweep at it.</p>
<p>However, before Zhou Wen could summon Truth Listener, the creature had already walked out of the cave. It was a tiger with two wings.</p>
<p>Its body was black, but there were many places that were transparent dark blue. As it grunted, the dark blue spots on its body alternated between bright and dark. When it was bright, it was like a glowing amethyst. When it was dark, it was the same as the other black spots on its body. It was blackish-gray like metal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sensed a powerful Essence Energy fluctuation from it. It was definitely a Mythical creature, but he didn’t know if it had the ability to undergo Terror transformation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen slowly moved his body, but the creature kept staring at him. Clearly, it had locked onto its target.</p>
<p>Roar! In the next second, the creature let out a tiger roar. Its body emitted a blue glow as it pounced forward.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was just about to counterattack when he suddenly realized something. He retreated but didn’t launch a counterattack.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A terrifying beam descended from the mountain and struck the Mythical creature, freezing its body in ice.</p>
<p>This rather powerful Mythical creature didn’t even have the chance to resist. Its body maintained its pouncing pose as it froze.</p>
<p>And on the mountain peak, a figure quickly floated down.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already used Truth Listener’s ability to see the figure clearly. It was a woman in a snow robe. She looked very beautiful, but her face was extremely cold. Furthermore, her aura was somewhat different from humans. Her entire body seemed to emit a frost aura.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, she was a dimensional creature with terrifying strength.</p>
<p>“Why would a snow cat come here?” The snow-robed woman was slightly surprised when she saw Zhou Wen. She extended her hand and sucked the snow cat into her arms.</p>
<p>At that moment, another dimensional creature with a snake’s tail and human body slithered down. It glanced at the frozen Mythical creature and said, “This Fairy Demonic Tiger is smart. It actually hid here. It’s no wonder it wasn’t sent to the human world.”</p>
<p>“Throw it into the void lightning,” the snow-robed woman said.</p>
<p>The snake-tailed dimensional creature responded and grabbed the frozen Fairy Demonic Tiger with one hand before throwing it towards the volcanic area.</p>
<p>The huge ice block streaked across the sky like a meteor. Soon, it rushed into an area filled with void lightning before disappearing.</p>
<p>“What about this little thing?” the snake-tailed monster asked as it looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I’ll deal with it myself,” the snow-robed woman said as she flew up and headed for the top of the mountain that resembled a heavenly pillar.</p>
<p>The snake-tailed monster didn’t say anything else and followed the snow-robed woman to the top of the mountain.</p>
<h3 id='chapter928'>Chapter 928: Ice Castle Bell</h3>
<p>As Zhou Wen was carried by the snow-robed woman, he felt a chill run through him as though he had fallen into an ice cellar.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the snow cat was a frost-elemental creature, so it was quite resistant to coldness. Otherwise, Zhou Wen might have to pretend to be frozen by the cold air around her.</p>
<p>The snow-robed woman quickly passed through the billowing black smoke and arrived at the peak of the mountain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked around and was suddenly alarmed to discover that the billowing black smoke that enveloped the ground was transparent. He could see everything below clearly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen secretly cheered inwardly. Thankfully, he had only used the normal strength of a snow cat when he scaled the mountain. Otherwise, he would have long been discovered.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was still somewhat uneasy. He didn’t know if his snow cat transformation could fool the snow-robed woman. From her looks, she was most likely at the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the snow-robed woman didn’t seem to notice anything wrong with Zhou Wen. After arriving at the mountaintop, she carried him towards a building.</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhou Wen realized that there was an ice sculpture-like castle on the mountaintop. The woman walked into the ice sculpture castle and the snake monster followed.</p>
<p>“Why did you bring such a snow cat back? Why don’t you just throw it back into the void lightning?” the snake monster asked.</p>
<p>“It’s none of your business.” As the snow-robed woman spoke, she walked up the ice stairs and quickly arrived in a room at the top of Ice Sculpture Castle.</p>
<p>This room was empty other than a crystal coffin.</p>
<p>The snow-robed woman walked to the crystal coffin and it automatically opened. After she carried Zhou Wen in and lay down, the crystal coffin automatically closed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen quickly realized that the snow-robed woman was sleeping in the crystal coffin. She looked human, but her body was colder than ice.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me she will keep sleeping like this? Zhou Wen struggled out of the snow-robed woman’s grasp and crawled to an empty spot in the crystal coffin. He turned to look at the woman and realized that her skin had turned into jade. If he hadn’t seen her walk over, he would have thought that she was a jade statue without any vitality.</p>
<p>Through the crystal coffin, he could see the situation inside. He couldn’t see anything further. Although the castle was made of ice, he couldn’t see anything through the thick ice wall.</p>
<p>With the snow-robed woman beside him, Zhou Wen didn’t dare summon Truth Listener.</p>
<p>If the woman discovered that there was an earring on his ear, anyone would know that there was something wrong with the snow cat.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, there really was a mistake during the teleportation. This isn’t the place where the bronze tripod should have teleported me. I have to teleport back as soon as possible. Zhou Wen glanced at the sleeping woman and thought to himself, Is she really sleeping or is she faking it? Perhaps my attack will be of some use to her when she isn’t in a Terror form.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen didn’t dare act rashly. In the end, he decided to wait a little longer. There was still about thirty hours left, so he didn’t have to worry about the tunnel closing for the time being.</p>
<p>The space in the crystal coffin wasn’t large to begin with, so Zhou Wen didn’t have much space to move around. All he could do was lie in the crystal coffin to rest and wait for an opportunity to arrive.</p>
<p>Time ticked by. Several hours passed, but the woman remained asleep. She didn’t move or breathe at all. It made Zhou Wen suspect that she was an ice sculpture.</p>
<p>He had no choice but to continue waiting patiently. After a while, he suddenly heard a clanging sound. It was like the sound of a bell that reported the time in ancient times, but it was somewhat different. The sound was clearer.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen heard it sound twelve times before the woman finally opened her eyes. Then, she carried Zhou Wen and climbed out of the crystal coffin.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief. If the woman continued sleeping like this, he would really be in trouble. He might have no choice but to barge out. Thankfully, that didn’t happen. He still had plenty of time.</p>
<p>The woman carried Zhou Wen downstairs and soon arrived in a hall. The snake monster was already inside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was suddenly taken aback. There was a bell hanging on the back wall of the hall. From the looks of it, the sound was likely from this bell.</p>
<p>However, the bell looked very similar to the bell The Thearch had mentioned.</p>
<p>That’s strange. Could it be that I didn’t teleport to the wrong place? This is the tower that The Thearch mentioned? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that something was amiss. If the tower refers to a mountain peak, there’s no reason for The Thearch to not make it clear. Furthermore, she said that the bell is on the highest level of the tower. She didn’t mention anything about an ice sculptured ancient castle.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen carefully sized up the bell. No matter how he looked at it, it looked like the bell The Thearch had mentioned. The various details of the bell were identical to The Thearch’s description.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Did I teleport to the right place? Is this the bell? Zhou Wen was momentarily stumped.</p>
<p>“You should know that forcibly retaining the creatures in the dimensional pool isn’t allowed, right?” the snake monster said as he glanced at Zhou Wen in the snow-robed woman’s arms.</p>
<p>“I’ve already said that I don’t need anyone to interfere in my matters,” the snow-robed woman said coldly before placing Zhou Wen on the ground and walking towards the bell.</p>
<p>When she approached the bell, the ice aura over her body quickly rose and her entire body turned into an ice sculpture.</p>
<p>Terror transformation! Zhou Wen immediately recognized the power the snow-robed woman was using.</p>
<p>The snow-robed woman walked to the bell and picked it up before shaking it.</p>
<p>Tinkle!</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen realize that the sound wasn’t from the bell. The bell’s sound was completely different from before.</p>
<p>With the bell’s sound, Zhou Wen felt an invisible force radiate out like a blast. Then, he felt the entire ice castle tremble.</p>
<p>After doing all of this, the woman put the bell back. Her body gradually left her Terror form.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what had happened, but the woman still looked exhausted.</p>
<p>“It’s been hard on you,” the snake monster said to the woman with a smile.</p>
<p>However, the woman ignored him. She carried Zhou Wen and left the hall.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to find an opportunity to escape, but when he saw the bell, he hesitated. He wondered if he should steal the bell first.</p>
<p>The woman carried Zhou Wen back into the crystal coffin and began sleeping again.</p>
<p>What’s wrong with this woman? Even if you are a dimensional creature, you can’t just be shaking the bell and sleeping, right? You should at least eat something, right? Zhou Wen really felt hungry when he thought of eating.</p>
<p>However, he couldn’t take anything out of the Chaos Bead to eat. He had to endure it.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a thought flashed across Zhou Wen’s mind. Could this woman be treating me as food?</p>
<h3 id='chapter929'>Chapter 929: Escaping with the Bell</h3>
<p>Inside the crystal coffin, Zhou Wen kept thinking about how he could obtain the bell and safely escape.</p>
<p>Although he wasn’t sure if the bell was the one The Thearch wanted, since he was already here, Zhou Wen still wanted to bring the bell back if possible.</p>
<p>The snow-robed woman at the Terror grade, and the snake monster might also be at the Terror grade. It wasn’t easy to take away the bell in front of two Terror-grade entities.</p>
<p>This was an ice castle. Earth Escape was useless. Teleportation was likely a more effective method.</p>
<p>As long as he could leave the ice castle, he could use the Earth Elemental Beast to escape to the spatial passageway on the mountain outside.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I have to take the risk. However, it’s still very difficult to take the bell away from two Terror-grade entities. Zhou Wen recalled what The Thearch had said about the bell.</p>
<p>The Thearch said that the bell couldn’t be touched by typical creatures. It had to be taken by a Companion Beast that had eaten the divine fruit. In other words, Doctor Darkness had to hold the bell until he returned.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen calculated the various possibilities and felt that with his abilities, although he wasn’t a match for two Terror-grade opponents, as long as he could obtain the bell, escaping back into the tunnel shouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen decided that if the woman took him to the bell again, he would snatch it.</p>
<p>Time ticked by. After twelve hours, Zhou Wen heard a bell-like chimes. After twelve chimes, the woman woke up again.</p>
<p>The woman carried Zhou Wen to the ice castle’s hall like the last time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately focused and planned on escaping after snatching the bell.</p>
<p>When the woman arrived at the hall, the snake monster was already in front of the bell. It was unknown if he had been standing guard there the entire time and had never left.</p>
<p>However, seeing the woman approach, the snake monster made way.</p>
<p>The woman placed Zhou Wen on the ground and was about to walk towards the bell when Zhou Wen saw that he couldn’t miss the opportunity. Without any hesitation, he switched to the Civilized Country Life Soul and restored his original appearance. He teleported in front of the bell while Doctor Darkness had already attached himself to Zhou Wen in his soul form.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out to hold the bell and felt his soul tremble. Thankfully, with Doctor Darkness possessing him, nothing worse happened.</p>
<p>The woman and the snake monster quickly reacted. The woman transformed into an ice maiden as the snake monster’s body suffused a strange glow. Four more arms grew out and the six arms emitted a strange light that shone at Zhou Wen, who had snatched the bell.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, he used teleportation to leave the hall again without stopping. After four consecutive teleportations, Zhou Wen finally rushed out of the Ice Castle.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time he rushed out of the ice castle, Zhou Wen summoned Earth Elemental Beast and thought to himself, With Earth Elemental Beast’s Earth Escape ability, I should be able to return to the spatial passageway with its maximum distance. Even if the two Terror-grade fellows catch up, I can use the remaining teleportation abilities to rush back to the spatial passageway.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen rode on the Earth Elemental Beast’s back and it landed, Zhou Wen was stunned.</p>
<p>Outside the ice castle was likely the huge mountain. Zhou Wen’s original plan was that as long as the Earth Elemental Beast landed on the mountain, it would use Earth Escape.</p>
<p>However, after he rushed out of the ice castle, he suddenly realized that it wasn’t the huge mountain peak outside. There was no longer the churning sea of clouds.</p>
<p>Everywhere he looked, there was blue seawater. Apart from the sea, he couldn’t see anything. The ice castle floated above the sea.</p>
<p>What… What’s going on… Zhou Wen was momentarily dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Plop!</p>
<p>The Earth Elemental Beast landed in the seawater and the seawater hit Zhou Wen’s face, immediately waking him up. Although he didn’t know what had happened and why the ice castle had turned into an endless sea, he had to try his best to escape. There was no other way.</p>
<p>Almost instantly, Zhou Wen ordered the Earth Elemental Beast to burrow into the sea.</p>
<p>However, before the Earth Elemental Beast could burrow down, an ice beam shot over from the ice castle. It was unbelievably fast.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart chilled as he unsummoned Earth Elemental Beast. At the same time, he used the Civilized Country’s spatial teleportation to leave the seawater.</p>
<p>When the ice beam landed on the surface of the sea, a large portion of the seawater froze. The seawater turned into an unknowingly thick glacier.</p>
<p>The snake monster charged forward in extreme rage. Its snake tail swayed as it arrived in front of Zhou Wen in the blink of an eye. Its six arms brought with them a gust of death as it crazily sliced through space, hoping to dismember Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and summoned Tyrant Behemoth to meet the snake monster. Tyrant Behemoth roared as it activated Absolute Strength and charged at the snake monster.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>Blood splattered from wounds that appeared on Tyrant Behemoth’s extremely tough body. One could even see broken bones from some of the wounds.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth screamed as it flew out and slammed into the ice. It shattered the thick glacier as large amounts of seawater spewed out from the crack.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took the opportunity to retreat dozens of meters. At the same time, he unsummoned Tyrant Behemoth and put on the Invisibility Cloak before instantly disappearing.</p>
<p>The snake monster scanned his surroundings, but he didn’t find Zhou Wen. He couldn’t help but turn to the woman and roar, “You brought that human back. Is he your accomplice?”</p>
<p>The ice maiden said coldly, “If it were me, do you think I would be so foolish as to let him steal the Heaven Shrouding Bell like this? If you have the time to suspect me, why don’t you think of a way to find him? He won’t be able to escape.”</p>
<p>“Explain this matter to the higher-ups yourself.” The snake monster seemed to think that what the ice maiden said made sense, but it still spoke hatefully before beginning to search for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Like him, the ice maiden searched everywhere for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wore the Invisibility Cloak and relied on three minutes of invisibility to rush into the sea, desperately swimming deeper.</p>
<p>The seawater here was extremely deep. When Zhou Wen dived deep into the seawater, he could vaguely see specks of light at the bottom of the sea, like stars.</p>
<p>However, the stars were colorful. It reminded Zhou Wen of the liquid in the volcano.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen dived deeper, he realized that he was right. At the bottom of the sea, there were countless colorful springs that spewed out all sorts of colorful liquid.</p>
<p>As the colorful liquid spewed out all sorts of crystal-like objects, they turned into different dimensional creatures when they came into contact with the seawater. However, they were different from the volcanic region from before. The dimensional creatures here were basically sea creatures.</p>
<h3 id='chapter930'>Chapter 930: Undersea Battle</h3>
<p>Is this really not where I was originally? Zhou Wen felt like crying as he watched the deep-sea behemoths swim in the sea.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was certain that something had gone wrong during the teleportation, but why did it happen?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment. The Thearch needed his help and wanted the bell, so she definitely wouldn’t play any tricks. The Nine-Tailed Fox didn’t seem to have any reason to mess with him if she wanted him to deliver a message to Emperor of Shang.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Nine-Tailed Fox had given the pearl to Zhou Wen. It wouldn’t do her any good if Zhou Wen couldn’t return.</p>
<p>Despite racking his brains, Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out the reason.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to think too much. There wasn’t much time left for the Invisibility Cloak. He had to think of a way to shake off the ice maiden and the snake monster as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that he would die a terrible death if they found him.</p>
<p>In the vast sea, Zhou Wen didn’t have many places to hide. All he could do was continue heading deep into the sea. He decided to find a spring to hide in.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to use the Eye of Legacy to transform into a dimensional creature, but there weren’t any low-level Legendary creatures nearby. It took quite some time to simulate an Epic creature, so the invisibility time would be up before he succeeded.</p>
<p>The spring was a place that gave birth to dimensional creatures. Furthermore, there were countless of them. It shouldn’t be that easy for the snake monster and the ice maiden to find him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to choose carefully. Three minutes of invisibility was too little. He didn’t have many options, so he swam towards a nearby spring.</p>
<p>It was a blue liquid spring. When Zhou Wen came previously, he had come out of the blue liquid. The blue liquid was safer.</p>
<p>As he watched the blue spring gradually expand in his vision, the blue liquid inside automatically isolated itself from the seawater, just like how water and oil don’t mix.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen plunged into the blue liquid and found it somewhat similar to the previous blue liquid. However, it was still different. The blue liquid here was darker in color and colder.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this temperature wasn’t enough to damage Zhou Wen’s body. Zhou Wen dived deeper into the spring and tried his best to hide.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the blue liquid was a blue crystal. It wasn’t surprising that it had a crystal body. What was strange was that the crystal bodies Zhou Wen had seen previously were densely arranged. There were many of them, but this crystal body was alone. No similar crystal body appeared around it.</p>
<p>The blue crystal was like a pineapple with many edges. It was about the size of a basketball.</p>
<p>Could it be that this is the only one left after all the crystalline bodies have been spewed out? Zhou Wen guessed inwardly. This was because he had seen many fountains spew out quite a number of dimensional creatures. It was impossible for there to be only one crystal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to think too much as he hid beside the crystal. The Invisibility Cloak’s three minutes of invisibility had ended. Although he was still visually invisible, complete invisibility was gone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen converged his aura and hid without moving. He wanted to preserve his life before finding a way to return.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s expression quickly turned nasty.</p>
<p>This was because Truth Listener had already discovered that the ice maiden and the snake monster had already swam down. From the direction they were heading in, they were clearly coming for the spring where he had hidden.</p>
<p>Crap, could it be a problem with this bell? Zhou Wen immediately realized the problem, but it was too late to throw the bell away.</p>
<p>If he rushed out now, it would be no different from courting death. Zhou Wen remained motionless as he hid beside the crystal.</p>
<p>Indeed, the ice maiden and the snake monster arrived outside the blue spring. The ice maiden looked at the blue spring and said, “The Heaven Shrouding Bell is inside.”</p>
<p>The snake monster glanced at her and said, “Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Do you think I’ll make a mistake?” the ice maiden said as she entered the spring.</p>
<p>The snake monster snorted coldly and didn’t say anything else. He followed the ice maiden into the spring.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that he’s here? Where is he?” The snake monster scanned the area, but he didn’t discover Zhou Wen. Clearly, he wasn’t proficient in searching for people.</p>
<p>The ice maiden said indifferently, “He’s right there. Can’t you see him?”</p>
<p>With that said, the ice maiden casually shot out an ice beam at Zhou Wen’s hiding spot.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to move. Thankfully, he was agile in water, so he didn’t need to use teleportation to dodge the ice beam.</p>
<p>However, the moment he moved, the snake monster immediately discovered his location. Although Zhou Wen was still visually invisible, it was useless.</p>
<p>The snake monster charged at Zhou Wen as terrifying wind blades crisscrossed and slashed at him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s movement technique was amazing, but his speed was still much slower than the snake monster. After dodging a few wind blades, he was unable to dodge them. All he could do was use teleportation again.</p>
<p>The wind blades that could slice through space failed to injure Zhou Wen. After rushing over, a wind blade slashed at the crystal behind him, causing a crack to appear.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to summon Earth Elemental Beast to see if he could use the rocks at the seabed to escape, he suddenly felt a terrifying vibration coming from underground.</p>
<p>Then, a powerful force surged from below, spewing out everything in the spring.</p>
<p>The power that erupted from the spring was very strange. Even the snake monster and the ice maiden couldn’t withstand it and were spat out.</p>
<p>Crap! Zhou Wen separated himself from the blue liquid. He was surrounded by seawater, so there was no chance for him to use Earth Escape.</p>
<p>After the snake monster and the ice maiden separated from the blue liquid, they surrounded Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Just as the snake monster was about to charge at Zhou Wen, it suddenly saw the blue crystal appear between the three of them. After leaving the blue liquid, the crystal rapidly transformed, quickly turning into a strange dimensional creature.</p>
<p>It was a blue clam. The blue crystal-like shell was fan-shaped and looked very beautiful.</p>
<p>The moment the dimensional creature appeared, it opened its shell and spat out a blue beam of light. Its target was the snake monster.</p>
<p>The clam-type dimensional creature’s attack on the snake monster had already surprised Zhou Wen. What surprised him even more was that the snake monster, which had already taken a Terror form, chose to dodge instead of blocking the blue light.</p>
<p>What’s that dimensional creature? It actually makes a Terror-grade existence wary. Zhou Wen’s mind raced as he wondered if this was an opportunity for him to escape.</p>
<p>The clam-type dimensional creature seemed to recognize the snake monster as it constantly spewed out blue light at him. The snake monster wore an ugly expression, but it only dodged and didn’t attack the shell.</p>
<h3 id='chapter931'>Chapter 931: New Era</h3>
<p>The snake monster was stopped by the scallop, but the ice maiden rushed over. An ice beam descended at an unbelievable speed. Zhou Wen had already pushed Transcendent Flying Immortal to its limits, but he still couldn’t dodge it.</p>
<p>After all, Zhou Wen was only at the Epic stage; just his stats alone were much weaker.</p>
<p>He had no choice but to use his teleportation ability again. However, he didn’t have many teleportation attempts left. It was impossible for him to last long.</p>
<p>He wanted to teleport to the bottom of the sea to see if he could use Earth Escape, but the ice maiden seemed to see through his thoughts. When the ice beam shone at the bottom of the sea, it immediately turned a large area of the sea into ice. It didn’t give Zhou Wen a chance to touch the sand and rocks.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen retreated as he fought. The number of teleportations in the Civilized Country was decreasing, and now there were only two left.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen had no choice but to use teleportation again, he suddenly felt the energy in Civilized Country explode. At that moment, Civilized Country advanced.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was overjoyed as the ghost-faced ring underwent a new change. The half-evil and half-beautiful ghost face underwent a strange change. The ugly half became extremely handsome, while the handsome half became abnormally ugly. The gears in his eyes also spun in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>At the same time, the evolved information of Civilized Country entered Zhou Wen’s mind. Although the information was very vague and wasn’t as clear as the annotations in-game, he could roughly understand its functions.</p>
<p>The evolved Life Soul of the Civilized Country was called New Era. The detailed abilities were unknown, but he could sense that the number of times he could use instantaneous transmission had increased. Zhou Wen didn’t know how many times he could use it, but it was definitely more than ten.</p>
<p>Great! Zhou Wen watched as the ice maiden shot out another ice beam. Having nowhere to retreat, Zhou Wen used his teleportation ability again.</p>
<p>This teleportation distance was much further than before. Furthermore, he didn’t sense the energy of the New Era Life Soul dissipate. From the looks of it, he could use it many more times.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen constantly teleported in an attempt to shake off the ice maiden, but he quickly realized that it was impossible to shake her off in the sea. She actually had a Water Escape skill that allowed her to appear and disappear in the sea, allowing her to teleport kilometers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suspected that the reason the ice castle changed from the volcanic area to the sea was because the ice maiden had previously rung the bell. He also tried to ring the bell in his hand, but no matter how he shook it, the bell wouldn’t ring.</p>
<p>Thinking back to when the ice maiden rang the bell, she had entered her Terror form. Thinking that this bell could only be used at the Terror grade, he had no choice but to give up on using it.</p>
<p>He teleported to the surface of the sea and the ice maiden chased after him.</p>
<p>After the snake monster shook off the scallop, it chased after him. Seeing that the ice maiden was still chasing Zhou Wen and wasn’t shaken off, it heaved a sigh of relief and quickly chased after them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used teleportation repeatedly in the sky and had once distanced himself from the ice maiden, but as long as he stopped, she would quickly catch up to him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen guessed that the ice maiden had a special method to sense the bell. Unless he threw the bell away, it was almost impossible to shake her off.</p>
<p>Although he could teleport multiple times with New Era, it wasn’t infinite. Zhou Wen knew that it would be used up sooner or later. He had to find a way to escape before that happened.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen continuously teleported, distancing himself from the ice maiden before rushing into the sea.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s luck wasn’t bad. He saw a group of dimensional creatures that had just spewed out of a spring. Most of them were at the Mortal stage, and he occasionally saw a few at the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>Now, these creatures were what Zhou Wen needed. He rushed over and used the Eye of Legacy to scan a Mortal-stage Golden Scaled Fish.</p>
<p>As it was a Mortal creature, the scanning time was very short. In the blink of an eye, Zhou Wen became a Golden-Scaled Fish that mixed with the school of Golden-Scaled Fish.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the bell couldn’t be stored in the Chaos Bead. After Zhou Wen transformed, the bell hung on his fin.</p>
<p>“Where did he go?” The snake monster caught up and asked when it saw the ice maiden stop.</p>
<p>“It’s right below. He wants to do the same thing again, so I feigned ignorance and didn’t chase after him. I waited for you to come over and capture him together to prevent him from escaping again,” the ice maiden said.</p>
<p>The snake monster immediately understood what she meant and asked, “He became a snow cat again?”</p>
<p>“He’s not a snow cat, but a Gold Scaled Fish,” the ice maiden said. “His transformation technique is somewhat strange. Even I can’t tell what dimensional creature he has transformed into. If he didn’t have the Heaven Shrouding Bell on him, it would have been very difficult to find him.”</p>
<p>“Where is he? We have to quickly snatch the Heaven Shrouding Bell back to prevent any accidents from happening,” said the snake monster.</p>
<p>“Alright, we’ll surround him from both sides and prevent him from escaping.” The ice maiden pointed at Zhou Wen and said, “The Heaven Shrouding Bell is on him. Take a closer look and you will be able to tell which one is him.”</p>
<p>With that said, the ice maiden rushed into the sea from one side while the snake monster entered from another side to do a pincer attack.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw the ice maiden and the snake monster plunge down, he knew that his transformation technique was useless. He immediately wanted to escape.</p>
<p>However, the snake monster didn’t give him a chance. Wind blades sliced through the sea and enveloped Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to switch his Life Soul and use teleportation again to dodge the snake monster’s attack. However, just as he teleported, he saw the ice maiden in front of him. An ice beam shone down.</p>
<p>Now, it wasn’t a matter of teleportation. He was too close to the ice maiden and the ice beam was too fast. Zhou Wen’s reaction couldn’t keep up.</p>
<p>However, thanks to his intuition cultivated from prolonged combat, Zhou Wen still used teleportation to dodge the strike. However, when he teleported out, he felt his head, hands, and legs being grabbed by someone as though he was wearing iron chains.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed. The person who had grabbed him was the snake monster with six arms. The hands at the top grabbed Zhou Wen’s head, while the hands in the middle grabbed his wrists. The hands at the bottom grabbed Zhou Wen’s feet. His expression was extremely ferocious as though he was a devil from hell, about to tear Zhou Wen’s body into six pieces.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen used Doctor Darkness’s Dark Right Hand. His right hand suddenly turned into nothingness and escaped the snake monster’s control. He stabbed it into its head, hoping to pluck its brain out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that his idea was a little too idealistic. Only a Terror-grade could defeat a Terror-grade. This was definitely not a joke. The Wheel of Destiny power of the Darkness Right Hand had actually penetrated the snake monster’s head, but it failed to extract his brain.</p>
<p>The brain was like a bull’s tendon; Zhou Wen had no way of pulling it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s actions made the snake monster cry out in pain. At the same time, he turned extremely furious as he exerted strength with his other five hands, hoping to tear Zhou Wen apart.</p>
<h3 id='chapter932'>Chapter 932: Ice Maiden’s Scheme</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body was restrained by the snake monster’s strange power, preventing him from teleporting away. He was alarmed as a terrifying tearing pain came from his body, as though his muscles and bones were about to be torn apart by the snake monster.</p>
<p>I can only risk it. Zhou Wen gritted his teeth. As he retracted his right hand, he held the Heaven Shrouding Bell in his right hand before using Darkness Right Hand again.</p>
<p>“Ah!” The snake monster held its head and screamed. Zhou Wen used the Darkness Right Hand to stuff the Heaven Shrouding Bell into its head.</p>
<p>He had only done it in passing and didn’t think that it would be of much use. He had originally planned on giving up on the Heaven Shrouding Bell. It would probably make it difficult for the ice maiden and the snake monster to track him down. In order to survive, he had no choice but to abandon the bell.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, after the bell was placed in the snake monster’s head, it made it hold its head and scream. For a moment, it forgot about tearing Zhou Wen apart.</p>
<p>Suddenly, an ice beam flashed. Just as Zhou Wen was about to dodge, he realized that the ice beam wasn’t directed at him.</p>
<p>This ice beam was extremely terrifying. The ice beam Zhou Wen had seen previously was considered warm when compared to this ice beam.</p>
<p>The ice beam shone on the defenseless snake monster, freezing it into ice.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took the opportunity to escape the two hands that were still grabbing at his feet and finally regained his freedom.</p>
<p>Did she accidentally hit the wrong person? Zhou Wen glanced at the snake monster who wore a look of horror and pain. He saw that it couldn’t move at all and was completely frozen.</p>
<p>It wasn’t an accident. It was deliberate. Zhou Wen looked at the ice maiden.</p>
<p>The ice maiden didn’t attack Zhou Wen again. She looked at him coldly and said, “The fox core on you belongs to the Nine-Tailed Fox, right?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted when he heard that. “Yes, you know her?”</p>
<p>“If I didn’t know her, why would I bring you into my castle?” the ice maiden said indifferently.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously suspected why the ice maiden had brought him into the ice castle.</p>
<p>If she wanted to rear pets, there were adorable dimensional creatures everywhere. She had seen more dimensional creatures than the grains of rice Zhou Wen had eaten. There was no need for her to make an exception and rear a snow cat.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you brought me into the ice castle to deal with him?” Zhou Wen suddenly reacted and glanced at the frozen snake monster.</p>
<p>“I have to thank you for that. If you hadn’t attracted all his attention, I wouldn’t have been able to succeed so easily.” The ice maiden’s tone was very strange as though she was talking about something unrelated to her. However, she clearly wanted to deal with the snake monster and had deliberately used Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“In that case, I did you a favor. Since everyone is friends with the Nine-Tailed Fox, let’s pretend nothing happened today,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Did the Nine-Tailed Fox ask you to steal the Heaven Shrouding Bell?” the ice maiden ignored his words and asked directly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss for an answer. If the ice maiden was the enemy of the Nine-Tailed Fox, it would be difficult for him to escape death if he said yes.</p>
<p>However, if the ice maiden was a friend of the Nine-Tailed Fox and he said no, he would probably end up missing a great opportunity to live.</p>
<p>With an instant’s thought, Zhou Wen decided to take a gamble and immediately answered, “Yes.”</p>
<p>“Why did she ask you to steal the Heaven Shrouding Bell?” the ice maiden asked again.</p>
<p>Seeing that she didn’t show any signs of anger, Zhou Wen knew that he had made the right bet. He said, “I don’t know about that. I was only entrusted by her to steal the bell. Also, I wish to meet Emperor of Shang and help her deliver a message.”</p>
<p>“What message?” the ice maiden asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“You aren’t Emperor of Shang. It doesn’t seem appropriate for me to tell you,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to say it,” the ice maiden said coldly.</p>
<p>“Alright, she only said ‘think not.’” Zhou Wen felt that it was best not to use force if he could.</p>
<p>“Hmph, if she really knew the words ‘think not,’ she wouldn’t have gotten you to steal the Heaven Shrouding Bell,” the ice maiden said with a twitch of her lips. Then, her hands emitted an ice beam. When the ice beam landed on the snake monster, it gradually disintegrated its body before shattering into ice shards. It left Zhou Wen’s scalp tingling.</p>
<p>This was a Terror-grade creature, but it was killed just like that.</p>
<p>Amidst the ice shards, an Essence Energy Skill Crystal and Heaven Shrouding Bell appeared. Unfortunately, none of them belonged to Zhou Wen. With a casual wave of her hand, the Skill Crystal landed in her hand.</p>
<p>“Emperor of Shang is a criminal. The place he’s imprisoned in an extremely dangerous dimension. With your strength, you aren’t strong enough to enter.</p>
<p>“Isn’t this a dimension?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“This can only be considered a buffer zone between Earth and the dimension. It’s not a real dimension. If you really go to the dimension and aren’t at the Terror grade, it will be difficult for you to even survive. How could it be so easy?” The ice maiden said, “If you aren’t afraid of death, I can show you the way and let you enter the dimension to meet Emperor of Shang. Whether you can survive in the dimension will depend on your luck.”</p>
<p>“Since it’s so dangerous, it’s best I don’t go,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You have been entrusted to do something, so how can you give up halfway?” The ice maiden paused and said, “Take the Heaven Shrouding Bell with you. Perhaps you will have a chance to walk to the place where Emperor of Shang is imprisoned alive.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen never expected the ice maiden to say such words. He couldn’t help but be overjoyed, but in the next second, his heart palpitated as he felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>When the ice maiden threw the Heaven Shrouding Bell at him, she suddenly shot out an ice beam. It was fast and ruthless, not inferior to the ice beam that had frozen the snake monster.</p>
<p>It’s really true that women are most vicious. Zhou Wen quickly teleported and forcefully escaped the ice maiden’s pursuit.</p>
<p>After rushing into the sea, Zhou Wen once again used the Eyes of Legacy to transform into an ocean dimensional creature. This time, although the ice maiden flew across the sky nearby, she didn’t discover him.</p>
<p>“You won’t be able to escape. This place isn’t Earth, nor does it belong to the dimension. There’s no way out. If you come out now, you can die a faster death,” the ice maiden said as she hung in the air, seemingly certain that Zhou Wen was nearby.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally couldn’t answer her. To answer her was equivalent to exposing his location. A heartless creature like the ice maiden definitely wouldn’t let him off.</p>
<p>Without the Heaven Shrouding Bell on him, the ice maiden couldn’t tell the difference between Zhou Wen and ordinary dimensional creatures. Zhou Wen followed the dimensional creatures and gradually left the area.</p>
<p>However, these dimensional creatures seemed to have a territorial sense. They wouldn’t go far, so Zhou Wen had no choice but to transform into another dimensional creature. He traveled further and further, hoping to escape the ice maiden.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned into a fish swimming when he suddenly saw a blue glow appear in front of him. It was like a glowing sapphire. Zhou Wen took a careful look and realized that it was the blue scallop. Without realizing it, he had returned to the vicinity of the spring with the blue liquid.</p>
<h3 id='chapter933'>Chapter 933: Unexpected Advancement</h3>
<p>It was unknown where this scallop came from, but it was able to make a terrifying expert like the snake monster retreat. It seemed to be very powerful.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had seen the blue light it spewed out. It didn’t seem as powerful as he had imagined. The blue light wasn’t fast, nor did he see any astonishing might. He didn’t know why the snake monster would take the initiative to retreat.</p>
<p>Now that Zhou Wen was running for his life, he wasn’t in the mood to study the scallop’s abilities, nor did he wish to cause trouble.</p>
<p>The scallop remained silently on the sand without being alarmed by Zhou Wen’s arrival. Apart from attacking the snake monster, it hadn’t attacked any other dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw a Fiend Claw Fish swim past it, but it didn’t react.</p>
<p>As he was sizing up the scallop, void lightning appeared not far away. The dimensional creatures that were struck by the void lightning vanished just like the dimensional creatures in the volcanic zone.</p>
<p>If the void lightning is really a spatial rift that leads to Earth’s dimensional zone, can I leave through that? Zhou Wen had similar thoughts before, but he couldn’t give it a try. If he made a wrong guess or if a human’s body couldn’t withstand the power of the void lightning, he would be doomed.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, he heard the ice maiden’s voice ring out on the surface of the sea. “If you want to live, we can have a chat. Hand over the Nine-Tailed Fox core and I can spare your life. You have to consider carefully. In three hours, I’ll leave this place. When the time comes, there will be no way out. You won’t be able to return to Earth or enter the dimension. You can only be trapped here til death.”</p>
<p>So she wants the pearl lent to me by the Nine-Tailed Fox, but it might be an excuse to lure me out and kill me. Zhou Wen didn’t move.</p>
<p>“You better believe me. Not many dimensional experts can even enter this place. No one will come here for tens of thousands of years. You only have three hours left. If you still want to live, come to the castle and find me.” With that said, the ice maiden returned to the ice castle.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally suspected that the ice maiden was luring him out, but he later realized that she had really left.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen secretly sneaked to the vicinity of the ice castle and saw that there was no movement inside. As for the ice maiden, she was indeed inside. It looked like she really had no intention of looking for him.</p>
<p>If the ice maiden could really take him back to the volcanic area, Zhou Wen was willing to give her the Nine-Tailed Fox’s pearl. After all, nothing was more important than his life.</p>
<p>The problem was that no one knew if the ice maiden would really keep her promise.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen couldn’t make up his mind. It was mainly because he didn’t have the ability to fight a Terror-grade entity. If he entered the ice castle, he would be at her mercy. It was equivalent to handing his life to someone else.</p>
<p>After circling the nearby sea, this place seemed to be an endless sea. It was as if there was nothing else in the world other than the sea.</p>
<p>I wonder if this place is connected to the volcanic area. Even if it is, I reckon that when I rush back, the time limit of thirty-six hours would have already passed. As Zhou Wen was thinking, he passed by the scallop.</p>
<p>Strange, why is it still here? Zhou Wen looked at the scallop in surprise.</p>
<p>Previously, void lightning had already swept through this area. The other dimensional creatures had vanished in the void lightning, but the scallop remained. It was clearly abnormal.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, this scallop is indeed extraordinary. Zhou Wen had the intention of studying its abilities, but this was reality, so he didn’t act rashly.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen attempted to use the Eyes of Legacy to scan the scallop. He wanted to see if he could transform into it. As long as he could transform into it, he would know what abilities it had.</p>
<p>The Eyes of Legacy looked at the sapphire-like scallop. His mirror-like eyes reflected its appearance.</p>
<p>The scallop remained motionless, allowing Zhou Wen to heave a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Large amounts of Essence Energy surged into his eyes. The amount of Essence Energy needed to simulate the scallop left Zhou Wen somewhat alarmed. This was about the same as when Zhou Wen scanned Torch Dragon Youngling.</p>
<p>After scanning for a while, he still couldn’t transform. There was too much information contained in the scallop.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy was about to be depleted. He failed to transform into the scallop, but the Eyes of Legacy began to evolve after copying so much information.</p>
<p>It can’t be… It evolved so easily… Zhou Wen still found it unbelievable. This advancement to a Perfect Body was too sudden.</p>
<p>At the same time, Zhou Wen was extremely delighted. The advancement of the Eyes of Legacy to a Perfect Body meant that his Constitution’s two Life Souls had reached a Perfect Body. His Constitution was finally reaching 41.</p>
<p>There were several Mythical Essence Energy Skills that he couldn’t cultivate in the past. He could try them now.</p>
<p>With the transformation of the Eyes of Legacy, Zhou Wen felt a mysterious energy spread to other parts of his body. As the blood flowed through his body, it caused a shocking change.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The ice maiden placed the Heaven Shrouding Bell back in the ice castle hall and waited for Zhou Wen’s arrival.</p>
<p>She wasn’t lying to Zhou Wen. According to the plan, she had to leave within three hours. And she had relied on the Heaven Shrouding Bell’s strength to come here.</p>
<p>Once she left, she didn’t know when she would return again. It was normal for no one to step foot in such a place for tens of thousands of years.</p>
<p>The dimensional creatures here might be treasures to humans, but to dimensional creatures, they were too weak. They were products of Earth’s civilizations.</p>
<p>Looking at the time, it was less than fifteen minutes to the deadline to leave, but there was still no sign of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“It looks like he won’t come. What a pity. If I can obtain the Nine-Tailed Fox core, I can spare his life,” the ice maiden muttered.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the ice maiden stood up and looked outside the ice castle. She saw Zhou Wen fly over from the distant sky and arrive in front of the ice castle’s door.</p>
<p>“You’re finally here?” The ice maiden walked out of the hall and stood on the ice steps outside. She looked at Zhou Wen and said, “There are only a few minutes left. You’ve finally made a wise decision. Leave the Fox core to me, and I’ll take you out.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the ice maiden and said, “I don’t plan on giving you anything. Not to mention the fox core, I won’t even give you a Black Chicken White Phoenix Pill.”</p>
<p>“So you want to die of old age here?” The ice maiden said expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“Of course not. I’ll leave with you,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>The ice maiden said disdainfully, “Do you think I’ll take you out if you don’t hand over the fox core?”</p>
<p>“Of course. It’s not up to you to disagree,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<h3 id='chapter934'>Chapter 934: Student Surpasses the Master</h3>
<p>“Oh, then I want to know the reason. Why must I take you away?” The ice maiden wasn’t angry. From her point of view, Zhou Wen’s words were like an ant bragging to an elephant. It was nothing but a joke.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen said, “It’s very simple. This is because you previously said that you have to leave this place within three hours. In that case, as long as I enter the ice castle, you can only take me with you once the three hours are up.”</p>
<p>“Does that mean you plan on walking into my trap?” the ice maiden mocked.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen could teleport, it wasn’t easy for her to capture him outside. However, the ice castle was only that big. Furthermore, the ice castle had a very powerful augmentation effect on her.</p>
<p>The ice maiden’s power could fill the entire ice castle. As long as Zhou Wen was inside, he had nowhere to hide.</p>
<p>Previously, she had wanted to use Zhou Wen to lure the snake monster, giving her a chance to eliminate him. That was why she had allowed Zhou Wen to easily leave the ice castle. Now, she didn’t have any scruples.</p>
<p>The moment Zhou Wen entered the ice castle, he was like a bird in a cage.</p>
<p>“It’s not walking into a trap, but a sparrow occupying a pigeon’s nest,” Zhou Wen said as he stared at the ice castle. If he wanted to leave this place, he had to enter the ice castle. There was no other way.</p>
<p>The ice maiden smiled. She had never smiled much in her life, but this time, she smiled. Furthermore, she smiled very happily as though she had heard an extremely funny joke.</p>
<p>“Then come. Let me see how you, a little sparrow, can occupy my ice castle,” said ice maiden.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen estimated that it was about time and walked towards the ice castle.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen entered the ice castle, the ice maiden didn’t immediately take action. Instead, she looked at him with interest and said, “I’ve seen quite a number of humans, but you are the first to be so ignorant and arrogant. How do you want to occupy my ice castle? You can take action now.”</p>
<p>“If you don’t take action, I can also be a good guest,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Do you know who you are talking to?” The ice maiden’s eyes flickered with a terrifying coldness as she glared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I was just about to ask.” Zhou Wen really didn’t know who the ice maiden was.</p>
<p>“The Nine-Tailed Fox dared to let you steal the Heaven Shrouding Bell, but she didn’t tell you about the four demon monarchs guarding it?” the ice maiden asked.</p>
<p>“What are the four demon monarchs?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“What a foolish and pitiful human. You don’t even know about the four demon monarchs, but you were tricked by that demon consort to steal the Heaven Shrouding Bell. However, it makes sense. The ignorant are fearless. If you knew what kind of existence the four demon monarchs are, you probably wouldn’t have dared to come here to steal the Heaven Shrouding Bell.”</p>
<p>The ice maiden continued, “On Earth, so-called Mythical creatures are nothing but cannon fodder among species in the dimension. The Terror grade is the beginning of the path of the strong. Only a Calamity grade has a seat in the dimension. The four monarchs of the demons are the royal families of the four demons. The descendants of these four royal families will definitely be able to advance to the Calamity grade, and I am from the Ice Monarch race of the four royal families.”</p>
<p>“So you are that powerful. Then are you a Calamity grade now?” Zhou Wen asked the ice maiden.</p>
<p>The ice maiden choked immediately. How could it be so easy to advance to the Calamity grade? Although she was from the Ice Monarch race, she only had the talent and potential to advance to the Calamity grade. To truly advance to the Calamity grade, not only did she need talent and potential, but she also needed a large amount of resources and personal effort.</p>
<p>“Even if I’m not at the Calamity grade, killing you will be as easy as flipping my hand,” the ice maiden said.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen didn’t like chatting, he would rather have a chat with the ice maiden if he could leave the area without any fighting.</p>
<p>“Then do you know who I am?” Zhou Wen suddenly asked solemnly.</p>
<p>“You? You’re just a human. You’re nothing. I don’t need to know who you are,” the ice maiden said with disdain.</p>
<p>“Of course, you can think that I’m mediocre or that you haven’t heard of me. However, I believe you should have heard of my teacher,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Who’s your teacher? Don’t tell me he’s also a human?” the ice maiden said, clearly not caring who Zhou Wen’s teacher was.</p>
<p>“That’s right. He’s a human. My teacher’s name is Wang Mingyuan. Have you heard of this name?” Zhou Wen actually only wanted to see if he could obtain any information about Wang Mingyuan. He didn’t think Wang Mingyuan was very strong.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan was indeed very strong among humans, but he had only recently advanced to the Mythical stage. In the dimension, the Mythical stage was nothing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used this tone to speak to the ice maiden because he wanted to use her arrogance to obtain some information about Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>However, the ice maiden’s reaction seemed to exceed Zhou Wen’s expectations. She looked at him in surprise and said, “You are Wang Mingyuan’s disciple?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be slightly taken aback. From the ice maiden’s expression, she didn’t show any contempt for humans when she mentioned Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>“That’s right. I’m Wang Mingyuan’s most outstanding and most beloved disciple. How do I compare to you, the descendant of the Ice Monarch?” Zhou Wen feigned a proud expression.</p>
<p>The ice maiden snorted coldly and said, “Wang Mingyuan is indeed capable by defeating the Dragon King of the Octokind and becoming the new monarch of the Dragon Gods. Unfortunately, no matter how strong your teacher is, he won’t come here to save you. Your life is still in my hands. Hand over the fox core and I can spare your life. I can also send you to the Dragon Gods.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was taken aback when he heard that. He originally imagined that something had happened to Wang Mingyuan, but to his surprise, Wang Mingyuan seemed to have done something extraordinary.</p>
<p>Even the ice maiden, who looked down on humans, was somewhat afraid when mentioning Wang Mingyuan. She didn’t have any intention of underestimating him. The Dragon Monarch that Wang Mingyuan had defeated was definitely not an ordinary dimensional creature.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no idea that the monarch of the Octokind were all Calamity-grade existences. However, there were differences in strength among Calamity-grades existences. Among the Octokind, the other monarchs were only average. However, there were two monarchs who were extremely terrifying existences. Even in the dimension, they were famous. One of them was the Dragon King.</p>
<p>The former Dragon King was so famous that he was comparable to the four demon monarchs. As for Wang Mingyuan, he had actually defeated the Dragon King and become the new king of the Dragon Gods. This matter shocked many dimensional species.</p>
<p>For such an expert, even if the ice maiden looked down on ordinary humans, she wouldn’t underestimate him.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in essence, Wang Mingyuan was no longer a pure human.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally didn’t know about this. However, from the ice maiden’s tone, he knew that Wang Mingyuan was doing pretty well in the dimension. Nothing bad happened because he took the divine fruit. This made him feel much better.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the ice maiden and said, “You dimensional species just don’t like studying. Haven’t you heard of the saying ‘the color blue is made out of indigo but is more vivid than indigo?’”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” The ice maiden clearly didn’t know this human proverb.</p>
<p>“It means that the teacher can be very impressive, but the students they teach are even more impressive,” Zhou Wen explained seriously.</p>
<h3 id='chapter935'>Chapter 935: Demon God Body</h3>
<p>The ice maiden laughed happily. This was the first time she had met a human like Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan was indeed powerful. No one would deny the strength of a human who could defeat the Dragon King. They would also give him the corresponding respect.</p>
<p>However, that was under the condition that Wang Mingyuan had the ability to earn the prestige. Furthermore, Wang Mingyuan had fused with a Guardian, so he was no longer considered a human.</p>
<p>After fusing with the Guardian, his body no longer had any human shackles. In essence, Wang Mingyuan was already considered a part of the dimension zone and not a human from Earth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was a pure Earth human who wasn’t even at the Mythical stage, yet he dared to say such words. The ice maiden found it very funny.</p>
<p>“Are all the humans on Earth as ignorant and laughable as you?” the ice maiden asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I don’t find it funny,” Zhou Wen said solemnly.</p>
<p>“Then you must be crazy. A human at the Epic stage who doesn’t even have the right to live in the dimension dares to be mentioned in the same breath as the Dragon King. You even claim that you have surpassed him. I’m afraid you don’t know what kind of existence a Calamity-grade existence like the Dragon King is.”</p>
<p>The ice maiden paused for a moment before continuing, “That’s right. It’s impossible for you to have a chance to see a Calamity-grade existence on Earth. On Earth, the Terror grade is already an unparalleled existence. If a Calamity grade comes close to Earth, even if it’s just an unconscious contact without any hostility, it will cause an unimaginable disaster to Earth. The ignorant are fearless. Your arrogance is understandable.”</p>
<p>With that said, the ice maiden ignored Zhou Wen and transformed into her Terror form. She walked to the bell, picked it up, and shook it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt the ice castle shake again before using Truth Listener to look outside. He realized that it wasn’t an ocean outside the ice castle, but he wasn’t back at the volcanic area. Outside, there was an endless grassland. He could see many dimensional creatures with human torsos but the lower body and legs of horses. Some dimensional creatures were even stranger.</p>
<p>After putting down the bell, the ice maiden slowly turned around and looked at Zhou Wen expressionlessly. “Your jokes are very funny, but I’m not interested in them. Hand over the fox core now and I can send you to the Dragon Gods. Otherwise, even if Wang Mingyuan is really your teacher, you will definitely die today.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t died before. I want to give it a try,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Very well.” The ice maiden’s gaze turned cold as her body emitted an ice beam. In an instant, the entire ice castle was enveloped by a terrifying cold aura. The interior space was filled, sealing off all possibilities.</p>
<p>The power of the Terror grade was indeed not something ordinary Mythical creatures could compare with.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time the ice maiden attacked, Zhou Wen’s body underwent a change. The speed at which he changed exceeded one’s imagination. As the ice castle was sealed, Zhou Wen turned into a blue scallop.</p>
<p>This was the ability that the Eyes of Legacy had given Zhou Wen after it advanced to a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>Demon God Body (Perfect Body): A carrier of the demons’ bloodline. A catalog of the myriad races.</p>
<p>In the past, the Eyes of Legacy could only scan and transform. Once it switched to other Essence Energy Arts, the transformation would be gone. If he wanted to continue transforming, he could only scan again.</p>
<p>However, the present Demon God Body didn’t need to go through that trouble. As long as Zhou Wen had scanned and transformed into the dimensional creature previously, he would be able to store the memory into the Demon God Body like a picture. He could directly transform when he wanted to use it without spending a lot of time and Essence Energy scanning.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Essence Energy expenditure needed to transform was further reduced as a Perfect Body Life Soul. With Zhou Wen’s current Essence Energy, he could support transforming into a Mythical creature.</p>
<p>Mutated Demon Mother Clam? The ice maiden’s expression changed when she saw the blue crystalline shell that Zhou Wen had transformed into.</p>
<p>Her ice beam shone on the blue crystalline shell, but it failed to freeze it. There seemed to be a blue vortex inside the blue shell. When the ice beam shone on it, it was immediately sucked in.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was in a very good mood. After his Life Soul advanced to the Demon God Body, he completed the scan of the Mutated Demon Mother Clam and turned into it.</p>
<p>He finally understood why the snake monster had been unwilling to attack the Mutated Demon Mother Clam. It was because it was like a demon’s recycling station.</p>
<p>It could devour all forms of energy released by demons and convert it into its own energy. Even the power of the Terror grade would be absorbed when it struck the Mutated Demon Mother Clam.</p>
<p>Of course, this power was only effective against demons. Devouring the energy of other species would instead cause adverse effects to the Mutated Demon Mother Clam.</p>
<p>It was a Mythical creature with obvious strengths and weaknesses. Almost no demon could harm it. However, against creatures other than demons, its combat strength wasn’t that strong.</p>
<p>This was a typical creature that specialized in disciplining its own kind during any internal strife.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen figured out the Mutated Demon Mother Clam’s abilities, he was immediately overjoyed. Without a doubt, the ice maiden was also a demon. Her Terror-grade strength would only be converted into energy and unable to harm Zhou Wen who had transformed into the Mutated Demon Mother Clam.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy couldn’t sustain the Mythical creature transformation for long. However, due to the Mutated Demon Mother Clam’s ability to absorb energy and convert it for its own usage, he could keep up the transformation for a long period of time after absorbing the ice maiden’s ice beam.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had deliberately infuriated the ice maiden because he wanted her to attack him so that he could absorb her energy and keep the Mutated Demon Mother Clam transformation for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder there’s only one Mutated Demon Mother Clam in the spring. It’s probably a unique Mythical creature, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>The ice maiden clearly knew the Mutated Demon Mother Clam’s ability as she looked at Zhou Wen in surprise.</p>
<p>The ice maiden didn’t think much of Zhou Wen’s ability to transform into low-level demons. There were many demons who were good at transforming.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was at the Epic stage, yet he could transform into a creature like the Mutated Demon Mother Clam. Furthermore, he had the same ability as the Mutated Demon Mother Clam. This was unbelievable.</p>
<p>This was because most of the transformations only changed one’s physique and couldn’t truly transform into that creature.</p>
<p>Even if one could completely transform into another creature, they could only go from a higher level to a lower level.</p>
<p>For example, a Terror-grade demon who was good at transforming could completely transform his body into a Mythical creature, but it was very difficult for him to turn into a Terror, much less a higher-level Calamity.</p>
<p>This was because the level of energy available ensured that it was impossible to go from a lower lifeform to a higher lifeform.</p>
<p>However, this wasn’t absolute. Among the demons, there was indeed an Essence Energy Art that could turn living creatures from a lower lifeform to a higher lifeform. It was the legendary Demon God Catalog. Legend had it that it was the Essence Energy Art progenitor of all demons.</p>
<h3 id='chapter936'>Chapter 936: Ice Maiden’s Suggestion</h3>
<p>The Demon God Catalog is a secret heritage of the Demon Sovereign. Only the royal family has the right to cultivate it. Furthermore, among the royal family, there are very few talented demons who have the chance of mastering the Demon God Catalog. As a human, it’s unlikely that he has seen the Demon God Catalog, much less master it…</p>
<p>The ice maiden was suspicious as she continuously struck the Mutated Demon Mother Clam that Zhou Wen had transformed into. However, the outcome was the same. Her strength was completely absorbed by the Mutated Demon Mother Clam.</p>
<p>It’s impossible for a human to master the Demon God Catalog… But he’s only at the Epic stage. How can he turn into the Mutated Demon Mother Clam and have its complete abilities… The ice maiden looked at Zhou Wen in surprise.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, you can only leave an unwelcome guest like me behind.” Zhou Wen had absorbed a large number of ice beams and accumulated terrifying energy in his body. He could maintain his transformation for a long period of time. As for the ice maiden, she was probably helpless against him.</p>
<p>The ice maiden calmed down and asked Zhou Wen, “Have you practiced the demons legacy catalog?”</p>
<p>“So what if I’ve practiced it?” Zhou Wen didn’t deny it when he saw that the ice maiden could tell the origins of his ability.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen admit it, the ice maiden seemed to find it unbelievable. She asked, “You really mastered the demons’ legacy catalog?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you see it already?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>The ice maiden looked at Zhou Wen with a strange expression, momentarily at a loss.</p>
<p>That was the demon ancestors’ Essence Energy Art. Only royalty had the right to take a look at it. It was a cultivation technique that might be a problem to master. Zhou Wen, a human, had actually mastered the Demon God Catalog. If news of this were to spread, it would probably shock the entire demon race. Perhaps no demon would believe it.</p>
<p>Even the ice maiden couldn’t believe that Zhou Wen had mastered the Demon God Catalog. However, other than that Essence Energy Art, she couldn’t think of any other Essence Energy Art that could allow him to achieve such a transformation.</p>
<p>Previously, when the ice maiden heard Zhou Wen talk about how a student could surpass the teacher, she found it funny. But now, she didn’t feel like laughing at all.</p>
<p>It was unbelievable that a pure human had mastered the Demon God Catalog.</p>
<p>“Where did you obtain the Demon God Catalog?” The ice maiden didn’t continue attacking. She even exited her Terror form and asked Zhou Wen with a strange expression.</p>
<p>“Does this have anything to do with you?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Although the ice maiden didn’t obtain an answer, she had some guesses. He’s only an Epic human. He can’t survive in the dimension, nor does he have the chance to mix with the dimension’s demons. It’s even more impossible for him to see the Demon God Catalog that only the demons’ royalty has the right to view. The only area he can come into contact with is Earth. Could it be that the legend is real?</p>
<p>Earth was in an ancient forbidden area. Even experts as powerful as the Demon Sovereigns couldn’t forcefully descend to Earth.</p>
<p>However, in the dimension, there was a legend that said that the ancient sealed land was the birthplace of the dimension. All dimensional creatures were born in the ancient sealed land.</p>
<p>However, that was only a legend without any evidence. Furthermore, powerful dimensional creatures didn’t believe that mighty existences like them would be born in such a low-level space.</p>
<p>Now, the ice maiden was beginning to suspect if the legend was real. Otherwise, how could Zhou Wen, a human from Earth, learn the Demon God Catalog?</p>
<p>Furthermore, if Earth wasn’t such a special place, why would the various races of the dimension be so concerned about Earth and constantly vie for control?</p>
<p>However, the ice maiden thought about it again. There had been several divine wars on Earth. Perhaps the Demon Sovereign’s bloodline that descended on Earth had brought the Demon God Catalog to Earth.</p>
<p>Regardless of the possibility, it was an unbelievable fact that Zhou Wen could master the Demon God Catalog.</p>
<p>The ice maiden looked at Zhou Wen and suddenly asked, “Are you interested in making a deal with me?”</p>
<p>“Tell me about it.” Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. Although he could now avoid being killed by the ice maiden, he would still be trapped here if he couldn’t return to the volcanic region. He still couldn’t return to Earth.</p>
<p>If the ice maiden still wanted the fox core and could guarantee his return to Earth, Zhou Wen could only give it up. Even if he had to face the wrath of the Nine-Tailed Fox, it was better than being trapped here.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, the ice maiden didn’t mention the core at all. “Give me the Demon God Catalog. I can give you the Heaven Shrouding Bell and take you to see the Emperor of Shang to help you finish what you need to do.”</p>
<p>“You want the Demon God Catalog?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He never expected the ice maiden to make such a request.</p>
<p>“That’s right. As long as you give me the complete Demon God Catalog, I can guarantee that you will complete the mission. Furthermore, I can also send you to the Dragon Gods,” said the ice maiden.</p>
<p>“How do I know if you will keep your promise?” Zhou Wen constantly thought of various possibilities. He felt that he really had a chance of returning alive.</p>
<p>“I can help you finish everything first. When we are near the Dragon Gods, I’ll exchange the Heaven Shrouding Bell for your Demon God Catalog before you leave,” said the ice maiden.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that the ice maiden’s suggestion was pretty good, but the problem was that he didn’t want to go to the Dragon Gods. Furthermore, he couldn’t produce the Demon God Catalog.</p>
<p>This was because the Demon God Catalog couldn’t be imparted with words. It was a picture. One had to look at the picture in order to comprehend the Demon God Catalog. It was an Essence Energy Art that could only be understood and not transmitted.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Wen, who had mastered the Demon God Catalog, couldn’t tell others how to cultivate the Essence Energy Art.</p>
<p>“All you need to do is give me an Essence Energy Art to obtain the Heaven Shrouding Bell and return unscathed. Aren’t you satisfied? Although you can transform into the Mutated Demon Mother Clam, you should know that the Demon Mother Clam’s strength can only guarantee that you won’t be killed by me. However, you have to know that as long as I leave this place and return to the demons, I can find a creature that isn’t a demon to kill you,” the ice maiden added.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sighed and said, “I also want to make a deal with you. Unfortunately, an Essence Energy Art like the Demon God Catalog can’t be taught with words.”</p>
<p>The ice maiden became even more convinced when she heard that. Zhou Wen had indeed mastered the Demon God Catalog. She asked, “How did you master it?”</p>
<p>“I saw a demonic beast catalog somewhere. This Essence Energy Art was comprehended from the demonic beast catalog. It can only be understood and not transmitted. If you really want the Demon God Catalog, you can only take a look at it yourself,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Where is the demonic beast catalog?” the ice maiden asked.</p>
<p>“Earth,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>The ice maiden revealed a difficult expression when she heard that. “Even the power of the Heaven Shrouding Bell can only pass through the buffer zone. It can’t enter Earth…”</p>
<p>“If you want to go, I have an idea,” Zhou Wen hurriedly said.</p>
<h3 id='chapter937'>Chapter 937: The True Dimension</h3>
<p>“What solution do you have?” The ice maiden stared at Zhou Wen in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Since I can come here, I naturally have a way to return. Otherwise, what’s the point of coming here to steal? However, this method is somewhat difficult,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“As long as you can let me see the Demon God Catalog, the Heaven Shrouding Bell will be yours,” said the ice maiden.</p>
<p>“That’s not what I mean. As you know, teleporting here is an extremely difficult task. I can teleport back alone, but if I take you along, the energy needed for the teleportation will probably be insufficient. If there’s a teleportation deviation, we won’t be able to survive,” Zhou Wen said with a solemn expression.</p>
<p>“What are you trying to say?” The ice maiden could naturally tell that Zhou Wen was up to something. If he really couldn’t teleport to Earth, he wouldn’t have said anything.</p>
<p>“If you really want to go, there’s a solution. However, I’ll have to trouble you. I have a spatial artifact. You can enter it first. That way, I can take you to Earth,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“This trick of paying me back in my own coin is pretty good,” the ice maiden said coldly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shrugged and said, “I don’t have such thoughts. As a Terror-grade expert, would you be trapped by a tool?”</p>
<p>The ice maiden looked at Zhou Wen without a word. Clearly, she wouldn’t agree to such a condition. Zhou Wen felt his hair stand on end from her gaze. All he could do was continue, “Alright, I still have a second solution, but it’s more difficult.”</p>
<p>“Tell me about it.” The ice maiden looked nasty.</p>
<p>“Can’t you dimensional creatures sign a contract with humans? Sign a contract with me and you can be my Guardian.” The contract Zhou Wen wanted was naturally not a Guardian contract, but the master-slave contract similar to the one Ya’er had signed with Grim Demon.</p>
<p>The ice maiden curled her lips and said, “Those who can contract are Guardians, not true races from the dimension. Guardians are half pets and half dimensional creatures, different from us.”</p>
<p>“Then I’m out of options,” Zhou Wen said as he shrugged.</p>
<p>“Show me your spatial container.” Zhou Wen took out the calabash containing the Dragon King Gu. The Dragon King Gu had been kept in the calabash, so it hadn’t been doing well recently.</p>
<p>Tai Sui treated it as food. When it was hungry, it would eat some of the Dragon King Gu. Although the Dragon King Gu had the ability to reproduce and heal itself, it needed energy. There was no energy supply in the calabash, so it relied on its own stores. The Dragon King Gu appeared somewhat weak.</p>
<p>“This is it. There’s a dimensional creature inside.” Zhou Wen handed the calabash to the ice maiden.</p>
<p>The ice maiden took the calabash and looked at it before studying it for a while. She nodded and said, “We shall use the first method. I’ll enter this calabash. Take me to Earth to see the Demon God Catalog. When the time comes, the Heaven Shrouding Bell will be your reward.”</p>
<p>“Alright, but before that, we have to return to the volcanic area. The spatial coordinates set by the Nine-Tailed Fox with me are there. Only by using those spatial coordinates as a marker can I contact her to open the spatial teleportation tunnel,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“No problem. I can take you there now,” the ice maiden said.</p>
<p>“You previously said that you can take me to see Emperor of Shang?” Zhou Wen thought of the Nine-Tailed Fox. If possible, he should help her pass the message to prevent himself from returning with nothing to say.</p>
<p>“Sure, but are you sure you want to go?” the ice maiden asked with a faint smile.</p>
<p>“Is there anything wrong?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing wrong with it. However, the place where Emperor of Shang resides is the true dimension world. The environment there isn’t as comfortable as here. Epic creatures would probably find it difficult to survive there,” the ice maiden said.</p>
<p>“I can transform into a Mythical creature. It shouldn’t be a problem, right?” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“Sure.” The ice maiden nodded slightly.</p>
<p>“How long will it take to get to Emperor of Shang?” Zhou Wen was afraid that he would take too long and miss the time needed to return. There wasn’t much time left until the 36-hour deadline.</p>
<p>“It’s not difficult to go where Emperor of Shang is. With the Heaven Shrouding Bell’s help, if your body can withstand the environment of the dimension, you can return in an hour,” the ice maiden said after some thought.</p>
<p>“Then let’s go. If I don’t settle this matter, I won’t be able to explain why to the Nine-Tailed Fox when I return.” Zhou Wen actually wanted to meet the legendary tyrant.</p>
<p>After all, this tyrant’s reputation was too illustrious in the history of the East District. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call him the number one tyrant throughout history.</p>
<p>If such a tyrant really existed, Zhou Wen wanted to see with his own eyes what he looked like.</p>
<p>“Alright, it’s best you prepare ahead of time. When you reach the dimension, the environment will have a very strong effect on your body,” the ice maiden reminded.</p>
<p>“I’ll head over in the form of the Mutated Demon Mother Clam,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Alright.” The ice maiden didn’t say anything else as she turned into her Terror form again. Then, she walked towards the Heaven Shrouding Bell and picked it up before shaking it thrice.</p>
<p>The ice castle trembled violently. It was much more intense than the previous two times. Zhou Wen could clearly sense the energy of spatial teleportation. Unfortunately, the New Era Life Soul had already advanced to a Perfect Body, so it couldn’t continue advancing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen floated in the air as a Mutated Demon Mother Clam, waiting for the moment he would be teleported to the dimension.</p>
<p>When the ice castle stopped shaking, Zhou Wen suddenly felt a terrifying force coming from his body. His body seemed to be attracted by a powerful magnet as he fell from the sky.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen slammed heavily into the icy ground as though there was a mountain pressing down on him. No matter how much strength he exerted, his Mutated Demon Mother Clam body remained motionless.</p>
<p>At the same time, he felt his mind tremble. His soul seemed to be oppressed by some unknown force, making him feel extremely uneasy. It was as though a terrifying existence existed in every corner of this world.</p>
<p>“How did this happen? Why can’t I move?” Zhou Wen asked the ice maiden.</p>
<p>The ice maiden looked at him with a faint smile and said, “I’ve already told you. The Mythical creatures that you humans think of are only the lowest level existences in the dimension. Although the Mutated Demon Mother Clam is special, it’s only a Mythical creature. On Earth, it’s a god-like existence, but in the dimension, it’s a scallop. Have you seen a scallop that can walk?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately rendered speechless. The ice maiden clearly knew of the outcome and had deliberately wanted to see him make a fool of himself.</p>
<p>“It’s about five kilometers from here to where Emperor of Shang lives. Are you sure you still want to go?” The ice maiden mocked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Of course. Why not?” Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and canceled the Demon Mother Clam transformation.</p>
<p>In an instant, Zhou Wen felt as though his body was a watermelon that was about to explode. His organs were about to burst.</p>
<p>Before his body exploded, Zhou Wen used the Mythical Demon Dragon True Body and transformed into a humanoid Demon Dragon. At the same time, he got Doctor Darkness to possess him and augment him with strength. Finally, he managed to withstand the terrifying pressure.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wiped the cold sweat off his forehead. For that instant, he really believed that his body was about to explode.</p>
<h3 id='chapter938'>Chapter 938: Emperor of Shang’s Place</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen felt extremely uncomfortable. Not only was he under immense pressure, but he also felt dizzy as his heart raced.</p>
<p>Under the protection of the Dragon Scale Armor, his Demon Dragon True Body still felt his skin flush with blood. It was almost about to split the scales open.</p>
<p>What made Zhou Wen even more uncomfortable was that everything he saw was a mysterious, dazzling light. It was as though he was looking through a kaleidoscope. He couldn’t even see the ice castle and the ice maiden in front of him, nor could he hear their voices. His senses couldn’t be used normally. Only two of his senses remained effective.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen opened his mouth and realized that he couldn’t even speak or make a sound.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt as though he had fallen into a space of despair. The feeling nearly made him break down.</p>
<p>Could it be that the ice maiden wants to harm me? Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>He hurriedly summoned Truth Listener. The ability Truth Listener gave him immediately restored his hearing, and the appearance of the ice castle and the ice maiden appeared in his mind again.</p>
<p>The ice castle and ice maiden remained the same. In Truth Listener’s hearing, everything was normal. However, when he used his senses to listen, he couldn’t see or hear anything. He didn’t even have a sense of touch.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen helplessly closed his eyes. As he couldn’t make a sound, he could only use his fingers to write in midair. “Why is this happening?”</p>
<p>“It’s impressive that you are able to maintain a portion of your bodily functions. This is the dimension, a space of a far higher level than Earth’s. Here, if your order in life isn’t up to standard, you won’t be able to see the existence of this world.” The ice maiden was somewhat surprised that Zhou Wen could still write with his body.</p>
<p>“I’ve been to the dimension before, but I didn’t feel this way,” Zhou Wen wrote again. He felt suspicious. He hadn’t felt this the last time he went to get the divine fruit.</p>
<p>“Then you definitely didn’t go to the real dimension,” the ice maiden said with certainty.</p>
<p>“It was definitely the dimension. I went to the divine tree which Teacher was guarding to pluck the divine fruit. Wasn’t that the dimension?” Zhou Wen wrote.</p>
<p>The ice maiden looked at Zhou Wen in surprise and said, “So the human who took the divine fruit is you. It’s no wonder an Epic like you could pick up the Heaven Shrouding Bell without being killed. From the looks of it, you are telling the truth. You are indeed Wang Mingyuan’s beloved disciple. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have suffered the pain of lightning smiting just to let you go. Although it was the dimension, the environment wasn’t that bad with the divine tree around. You have never experienced the real world of the dimension.”</p>
<p>“What lightning smiting?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he hurriedly wrote.</p>
<p>“Don’t you know?” The ice maiden thought for a moment and continued, “That’s right. You left after taking the divine fruit, so you naturally don’t know what happened after that. The divine fruit can be taken away, but the human who obtains it has to sign a contract to become the spokesperson of the dimension in the human world. Wang Mingyuan didn’t let you sign the contract before letting you return to Earth. Naturally, you have to be punished. The pain of the lightning smiting isn’t something anyone can endure. Even the closest relatives of the dimension’s species might not be willing to suffer in place of others. Yet, he endured so long for you. It’s not overboard to say that you are his most beloved disciple.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what to feel as he immediately wrote again. “Teacher actually suffered so much for me. Can you take me to him?”</p>
<p>“It’s useless even if you go now. He’s already the supreme Dragon King. Even the Dragon King who punished him has been defeated. Who else dares to punish him? Don’t worry. He’s very well now. You have no idea how respected is,” the ice maiden said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a little more at ease, but he didn’t know how to repay Wang Mingyuan’s kindness.</p>
<p>“Are you going to see Emperor of Shang or Wang Mingyuan?” the ice maiden asked.</p>
<p>“Emperor of Shang,” Zhou Wen said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>Even if he went to see Wang Mingyuan now, he didn’t have the ability to return the favor. Instead, he might cause trouble. Therefore, Zhou Wen decided not to meet Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>“If you can withstand the burden, follow me.” The ice maiden smiled as she walked out of the ice castle.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen felt as though every step he took was a fight against the world. It was extremely strenuous. Before he walked out of the ice castle, he felt his eyes blur and ears ring. His legs were so weak that he could barely stand.</p>
<p>“If you walk like this, it will probably take you days to reach the destination,” the ice maiden said to Zhou Wen as she stood at the entrance of the ice castle.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that the ice maiden was waiting for him to beg her. When the time came, she would definitely raise more conditions.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and wanted to summon Tyrant Behemoth, but after taking a look, he realized that Tyrant Behemoth had been injured by the snake monster. Its injuries hadn’t healed yet, so it probably couldn’t withstand the dimensional forces.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen summoned Torch Dragon Youngling. He wanted to see if Torch Dragon Youngling could withstand the dimensional forces and use it as a mount to take him to Emperor of Shang.</p>
<p>After Torch Dragon Youngling appeared, although its situation was slightly better than Zhou Wen’s, its actions were greatly restricted. It looked like its actions were very slow, completely lacking its usual speed.</p>
<p>“Torch Dragon?” The ice maiden looked at Torch Dragon Youngling in surprise. Clearly, she recognized Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Torch Dragon was different from ordinary dimensional creatures. It was an existence with the potential to advance to the Calamity grade. Such dimensional creatures were very rare in the dimension. She never expected Zhou Wen to have a Torch Dragon Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Could it be that Earth is really the birthplace of the dimension? Otherwise, how could there be a dimensional creature like Torch Dragon? The ice maiden was alarmed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen got Torch Dragon to use World King Transformation. Under the state of World King Transformation, Torch Dragon immediately could move easily. Under the state of World King Transformation, as long as it didn’t use the Bright Torch Vision World, it could still maintain its state for a period of time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen rode on Torch Dragon’s back and said to the ice maiden, “Let’s go. I don’t have much time.”</p>
<p>The ice maiden nodded and led the way. Her footsteps were brisk. As for Torch Dragon, it could only barely follow behind after using all its strength.</p>
<p>After leaving the ice castle, Zhou Wen saw a stone staircase, but he couldn’t hear what was outside. It was as though he was enveloped by boundless fog.</p>
<p>As he followed the ice maiden through the fog, Zhou Wen could occasionally hear terrifying sounds coming from the fog. They were very strange and he couldn’t tell what they were from.</p>
<p>Here, Zhou Wen couldn’t sense the passage of time. He couldn’t estimate how long he had walked. When the ice maiden stopped, a strange building appeared at the end of the stone steps.</p>
<p>“Emperor of Shang is inside. Go in yourself. He probably doesn’t wish to see demons, so I won’t be entering,” the ice maiden said as she pointed at the strange building in front of them.</p>
<h3 id='chapter939'>Chapter 939: Good Things Are Inbound For You</h3>
<p>The building was indeed odd. It looked like a stone temple. The door to the stone temple was open, so it wasn’t appropriate for Zhou Wen to ride Torch Dragon in. When he arrived at the door, he summoned Torch Dragon again and walked into the stone temple step by step.</p>
<p>What kind of person is Emperor of Shang? Zhou Wen was extremely curious. Due to his excessive curiosity, his fatigue decreased significantly.</p>
<p>Due to Truth Listener’s ability, the range it could hear was very limited. Only when Zhou Wen walked into the stone temple did he roughly understand the situation inside.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Zhou Wen looked at the scene inside the ancient temple in disbelief.</p>
<p>There were many strange things placed in the stone temple. Zhou Wen didn’t know what most of them were for, but he recognized the red words of ‘joy’ often found at weddings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on the pillars on both sides of the stone temple, there were words written about a ‘match made in heaven’ and ‘a happy ending.’ The layout of the entire ancient temple was completely different from what Zhou Wen had imagined.</p>
<p>If he didn’t know that Emperor of Shang was inside, Zhou Wen would have imagined that this was the ancient version of an Elder Moon Temple.</p>
<p>“May I know if the Imperial Lord is here? I was entrusted by an old friend in Deer Terrace Pavilion to bring a message.” After Zhou Wen entered the stone temple, he realized that his senses had recovered significantly. He could see and make sounds.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare mention the Nine-Tailed Fox’s name, so he could only say that it was an old friend.</p>
<p>“Come in.” A voice sounded from the hall.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that the voice was very deep and masculine, so he walked into the hall.</p>
<p>He didn’t know what was so special about the stone temple. Even walking felt much easier. After walking into the hall, he saw a man sitting on a stone platform.</p>
<p>Typically, that was a spot meant to consecrate deities, but there were no statues there. There was only one person, and he was a real human.</p>
<p>Is this the famous tyrant? Has he really lived to this day? Zhou Wen looked at the man on the stone platform in disbelief.</p>
<p>The man was completely different from the King Zhou of Shang that Zhou Wen had imagined. He didn’t have a tall, stocky figure, nor did he have a domineering aura. He looked like a very quiet man. He was handsome and didn’t have a thin figure. He was slender and muscular, giving him a refined aura.</p>
<p>If he met this person outside, Zhou Wen believed that he was a young and promising professor. He definitely wouldn’t believe that he was a tyrant.</p>
<p>Emperor of Shang sat on the stone platform in a very comfortable posture. One of his hands rested on his knee while the other held a flask of alcohol. He drank without looking at Zhou Wen and said casually, “What message did she get you to bring?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I need to confirm that you are Emperor of Shang,” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Emperor of Shang looked up at him. “Since you are able to come here, don’t you know that I’m the only prisoner here?”</p>
<p>“She told me to pass you the message: think not.” Zhou Wen hurriedly conveyed the Nine-Tailed Fox’s words to the Emperor of Shang.</p>
<p>“Think not… Think not… ‘Think not’ indeed…” Emperor of Shang suddenly laughed loudly, looking extremely carefree.</p>
<p>After Emperor of Shang finished laughing, Zhou Wen said, “The message has been delivered. It’s time for me to bid you farewell to report to her.”</p>
<p>“Wait.” Emperor of Shang stopped Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stopped in puzzlement and looked at him. Emperor of Shang extended his hand and threw something at Zhou Wen. “This is my reward for you. Help me pass a message to her as well.”</p>
<p>“Imperial Lord, please speak.” Zhou Wen saw that the item that the Emperor of Shang had thrown at him was a palm-sized stone tablet. The stone tablet had the red word “joy” engraved on it. Apart from that, there was nothing else. He didn’t know what it was for.</p>
<p>“Wait,” the Emperor of Shang said.</p>
<p>“What?” Zhou Wen was momentarily taken aback.</p>
<p>“Wait,” the Emperor of Shang repeated.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen react. He looked at Emperor of Shang and asked, “You want me to pass her the word: wait? Actually, you can say more.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need. Go back. Your human body shouldn’t stay in the dimension for too long,” Emperor of Shang said indifferently.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to leave, feeling extremely puzzled.</p>
<p>Emperor of Shang was completely different from what he had imagined. Furthermore, the place he resided was somewhat different from what Zhou Wen had imagined.</p>
<p>If Emperor of Shang was a prisoner, the place that imprisoned him was like child’s play. There wasn’t even a guard. It looked like he was alone, and he didn’t see anything that restrained him.</p>
<p>Furthermore, an ordinary human like him could enter and leave as he pleased. It didn’t seem like a prison.</p>
<p>“Is everything done?” the ice maiden asked when she saw Zhou Wen come out.</p>
<p>“It’s done.” Zhou Wen wanted to say something, but after leaving the stone temple, he returned to his previous state. He couldn’t make a sound and could only write.</p>
<p>“What did he say?” the ice maiden asked again.</p>
<p>“He didn’t say anything. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have come out so quickly.” Zhou Wen didn’t wish to tell the ice maiden about the message Emperor of Shang wanted him to pass.</p>
<p>The ice maiden curled her lips and said, “You don’t have to be nervous. I’m not trying to pry into his secrets. In fact, he doesn’t have any secrets.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s go. We have to hurry back. We don’t have much time left.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he summoned Torch Dragon again. Just as he was about to put away the stone tablet and leave, the ice maiden grabbed his hand.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” The ice maiden pulled up Zhou Wen’s hand that was holding the stone tablet and stared intently at it.</p>
<p>“A stone tablet. What else can it be?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised, unsure why the ice maiden had such a huge reaction.</p>
<p>“Did Emperor of Shang give it to you?” The ice maiden’s gaze remained fixed on the stone tablet.</p>
<p>“Yes, do you know what this is?” Zhou Wen thought to himself. From the looks of it, the stone tablet that Emperor of Shang gave me seems to be something good. Don’t tell me that the ice maiden wants to snatch it from me?</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen thought about it, the ice maiden released her hand and looked at him with an odd expression. “Of course I know. I’m afraid everyone in the dimension knows.”</p>
<p>“Oh, so this stone tablet has a great background. What’s its use?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>The ice maiden suddenly smiled and said, “Why should I tell you? It’s fine if you want to know, but that depends on whether you pay the price.”</p>
<p>“Forget it.” Zhou Wen put away the stone tablet and rode Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>Since many people in the dimension knew about it, there was no need for him to ask the ice maiden. He could just ask The Thearch when he returned.</p>
<p>Thinking nothing of it, the ice maiden said without head or tail, “Good things are inbound for you.” She led the way and took Zhou Wen back to the ice castle.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept thinking about what the ice maiden meant by “good things are inbound for you,” but he couldn’t figure it out.</p>
<h3 id='chapter940'>Chapter 940: Imprisoning the Ice Maiden</h3>
<p>After returning to the ice castle, the ice maiden once again used the Heaven Shrouding Bell. However, after using it, she appeared extremely weak. It looked like she had expended a lot of energy.</p>
<p>Even a Terror-grade expert pays such a heavy cost to use the Heaven Shrouding Bell. I wonder if the Heaven Shrouding Bell is the bell The Thearch wants. Zhou Wen was now certain that he hadn’t successfully teleported to the place The Thearch wanted him to go, but the Heaven Shrouding Bell was almost identical to the bell The Thearch had described. It could be the same bell.</p>
<p>The ice castle came to the volcanic area again. The ice maiden shrank the ice castle to the size of a ring and put it away.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen led the ice maiden to a volcano and said, “This is it. Enter the calabash.”</p>
<p>The ice maiden frowned and said, “It won’t be too late for me to enter after you open the spatial passageway.”</p>
<p>“Although I’m not very smart, I’m not stupid. You could enter the spatial passageway directly once I open it. You would then be leaving me alone behind to await death, so no can do,” Zhou Wen said with a firm shake of his head.</p>
<p>The ice maiden thought for a moment and said, “Alright, give me the calabash.”</p>
<p>The ice maiden was confident that she wouldn’t be trapped by the calabash, so she didn’t insist.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen handed the calabash to the ice maiden, who entered it.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’m about to open a spatial passageway. Wait a moment, and we will be teleporting to Earth,” Zhou Wen said as he picked up the calabash and stuffed it into the Chaos Bead.</p>
<p>The calabash might be broken, but the Chaos Bead was a legendary treasure of a mighty god. The ice maiden probably couldn’t break out of the Chaos Bead so easily.</p>
<p>The ice maiden clearly hadn’t discovered that she had been sent into a special space. Zhou Wen didn’t explain it either. It wouldn’t be too late to release her when she couldn’t wait any longer.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen’s release meant releasing her from the calabash. Her person would still be in the chaos space to prevent her from destroying the calabash.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if it was 36 hours yet, so he didn’t dare delay any further. He headed straight for the volcanic pool.</p>
<p>How could he open a spatial passageway? The bronze tripod’s spatial passageway had always been open. It was open for only 36 hours.</p>
<p>Thankfully, when Zhou Wen returned to the blue liquid volcano, the spatial passageway in the pool was still open. Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate to enter. He was still somewhat uneasy. If another teleportation malfunction happened, he didn’t know if he could safely return to Deer Terrace Pavilion.</p>
<p>After a long teleportation, Zhou Wen saw that he had returned to the bronze tripod cauldron. The Nine-Tailed Fox was staring at him and he was delighted.</p>
<p>“Did you pass the message I entrusted you?” the Nine-Tailed Fox asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Although there were some twists and turns, I finally met the Emperor of Shang. I passed him your message,” Zhou Wen said as he returned the pearl to the Nine-Tailed Fox.</p>
<p>“Did he say anything?” the Nine-Tailed Fox asked hesitantly.</p>
<p>“He also got me to pass a message to you, but there’s only one word: wait.” Zhou Wen conveyed the Emperor of Shang’s words to the Nine-Tailed Fox.</p>
<p>The Nine-Tailed Fox was slightly taken aback when it heard that. A complicated human expression appeared on its face. After a long while, it opened its mouth and sucked the pearl in Zhou Wen’s hand back.</p>
<p>“Leave.” The Nine-Tailed Fox had no intention of killing Zhou Wen. It didn’t even suspect the authenticity of Zhou Wen’s message.</p>
<p>Perhaps she had some doubts previously, but after hearing this word, she no longer doubted it. This was because there were some things that only the person in question could say. Others couldn’t imitate it.</p>
<p>The simple word ‘wait’ made the Nine-Tailed Fox understand many things.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare stay any longer. There were too many horrors in Chess Mountain. Apart from the Nine-Tailed Fox, there were definitely other Terror-grade existences. Zhou Wen suspected that the four demon general statues he had seen were Terror-grade experts that had been sealed.</p>
<p>After leaving, Zhou Wen hurriedly walked out of Deer Terrace Pavilion.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? Have we not reached Earth?” The ice maiden in the calabash couldn’t sense the situation outside, but too much time had passed. She was already suspicious even before Zhou Wen left Deer Terrace Pavilion.</p>
<p>“We’re here. You can come out.” Zhou Wen opened the calabash’s mouth.</p>
<p>However, the ice maiden remained somewhat suspicious. This was because she was a Terror-grade dimensional creature. She would be restricted if she descended to Earth. It was impossible for her to maintain her original Terror grade.</p>
<p>However, she didn’t feel any restrictions on her body, so she didn’t believe that she had already arrived on Earth.</p>
<p>Since Zhou Wen hadn’t imprisoned her, she naturally didn’t need to destroy the calabash to drill out of it.</p>
<p>Just as the ice maiden came out of the calabash, she realized that the calabash beside her had vanished. As for her, she was in a void of chaos. There was an endless chaos space around her. There was no sign of Zhou Wen, nor could she see Earth. This immediately made the ice maiden realize that something was amiss.</p>
<p>“What did you do?” The ice maiden had already transformed into her Terror form. She shot out a terrifying ice beam, hoping to see where this space was.</p>
<p>Her terrifying ice beam shot out without any obstruction, but it failed to reach the end. It was as though the void’s chaos space was infinite, making the ice maiden’s expression turn nasty.</p>
<p>“This is Earth. We’ve already arrived on Earth. However, to prevent you from being injured by Earth’s powers, I’ve temporarily found a place for you to stay. Feel at ease and rest here for the time being,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Do you know what you are doing? Do you know what will happen to you if I get out?” the ice maiden said with a cold expression.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t angry as he continued, “I’ve been so good to you and even arranged such a nice place for you to stay. Shouldn’t you pay some rent? I think you should just hand the Heaven Shrouding Bell to me as rent.”</p>
<p>“You’re dead.” The ice maiden’s expression was cold as she summoned the ice castle.</p>
<p>The ice castle constantly expanded in the chaos space, returning to its original size. The ice maiden then walked into the ice castle and picked up the Heaven Shrouding Bell.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t too nervous. Even if she could really come out of the chaos space, she and the Heaven Shrouding Bell had already arrived at Chess Mountain. Zhou Wen could explain to The Thearch, so she could deal with her herself.</p>
<p>The ice maiden shook the Heaven Shrouding Bell, hoping to teleport out of the mysterious chaos space. However, after shaking it a few times, she realized that the ice castle remained in the chaos space and couldn’t be teleported out. This immediately left the ice maiden alarmed and furious.</p>
<p>She didn’t know what Zhou Wen’s space was. Even the Heaven Shrouding Bell couldn’t break out. Now, she was really trapped inside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted when he saw that she couldn’t come out. He continued, “Think about it. Give me the Heaven Shrouding Bell first. If I’m in a good mood, I can consider letting you out.”</p>
<p>“In your dreams.” The ice maiden was filled with hatred. She never expected to ultimately fall into Zhou Wen’s hands.</p>
<h3 id='chapter941'>Chapter 941: Fruit Ripens</h3>
<p>“Where’s the bell?” Zhou Wen wanted to say something to the ice maiden when he suddenly heard The Thearch’s voice in his mind.</p>
<p>“The Thearch, something wrong happened during the teleportation. I didn’t find the tower you mentioned,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“Impossible. The bronze tripod can only teleport to one place. You must have been able to see that tower.” Although The Thearch said so, she seemed to be holding back.</p>
<p>She didn’t see Doctor Darkness holding the bell, and the bell could only be held by experts at or above the Terror grade. Ordinary storage spaces couldn’t store the bell.</p>
<p>“I’m telling the truth.” Zhou Wen immediately recounted his experience.</p>
<p>When The Thearch heard his description of the volcanic region, she believed him a little. This was because it was very difficult to enter that area from Earth or the dimension. If Zhou Wen had only heard of the existence of such a place, it was impossible for him to describe it in such detail.</p>
<p>Strange, how did he teleport there? In the cave, The Thearch muttered to herself. She already believed that Zhou Wen hadn’t obtained the bell.</p>
<p>The place she wanted Zhou Wen to go was in a dimensional space. And with Zhou Wen in that volcanic area, it was impossible for him to enter another dimension, so it was naturally impossible for him to find the tower to obtain the bell.</p>
<p>“That’s not right. If you hadn’t entered the dimension, how could you have helped the Nine-Tailed Fox pass her message to the Emperor of Shang?” The Thearch suddenly realized something.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen heard The Thearch’s words, he knew that nothing in Chess Mountain could hide from her. Thankfully, he only needed to use his mind to converse with the ice maiden in the chaos space. He likely hadn’t been discovered by The Thearch. All he could do was continue, “I’m not done. After I arrived at the volcanic area, I saw a huge mountain peak. It was like a heavenly pillar that pierced into the sky. I thought the tower you mentioned was atop that, so I ascended it. To my surprise, I didn’t see the tower, but I saw an ice castle…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen fabricated some changes filled with half-truths. He didn’t mention the Heaven Shrouding Bell or the ice maiden that he had abducted and brought to Earth.</p>
<p>What you want is the bell in the tower. The one I have isn’t the bell in the tower. It’s naturally not what you want, Zhou Wen thought. He planned on getting the Heaven Shrouding Bell from the ice maiden and monopolizing it for himself.</p>
<p>Seeing how detailed Zhou Wen was, The Thearch knew that something had gone wrong with Zhou Wen’s teleportation. It was already lucky for him to return alive.</p>
<p>“I never expected such a teleportation mistake to happen to the bronze tripod. How strange. Did you do anything during the teleportation?” The Thearch asked in thought.</p>
<p>“What could I do? I was just waiting for the teleportation,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>The Thearch thought for a moment and felt that Zhou Wen’s strength wasn’t capable of affecting the spatial teleportation. Furthermore, he wasn’t a fool. Why would he deliberately make a mess of the teleportation coordinates?</p>
<p>Unable to figure it out, The Thearch didn’t say anything else. She waited until Zhou Wen walked to the flower outside Chess Mountain before saying, “Swear to the flower that you didn’t obtain the bell.”</p>
<p>Although The Thearch didn’t think there was anything wrong with what Zhou Wen had said, she didn’t trust him.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen raised his hand and swore at the flower on the mountain wall. “I swear that I didn’t see the tower or obtain a bell from the tower. If there’s any falsehood, I’ll be condemned by my conscience for life.”</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A clap of thunder sounded out of thin air. It looked like the power of the oath had taken effect, but Zhou Wen was safe and sound. Only then did The Thearch believe him.</p>
<p>“The Thearch, if there’s nothing else, I’ll head back now.” Zhou Wen bade farewell and left Chess Mountain to return to school.</p>
<p>Although The Thearch felt that something was amiss, she couldn’t figure out what it was.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen left Chess Mountain, he finally heaved a sigh of relief. Although this trip to the dimension was extremely dangerous, it wasn’t without harvests. At the very least, now that the ice maiden was in his hands, he would be able to obtain the Heaven Shrouding Bell sooner or later.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s surprise, the ice maiden seemed to be completely unaffected by Earth in the chaos space. The taboo power restriction she mentioned didn’t appear.</p>
<p>The ice maiden remained cooped up in the ice castle. It looked like she was thinking of a solution, but with the Heaven Shrouding Bell useless, the chances of her escaping were almost zero, so Zhou Wen wasn’t too worried.</p>
<p>Before he arrived on campus, Zhou Wen received a lot of messages from his phone. Some were from Li Xuan, Wang Lu, and even Zhang Yuzhi.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen replied to some messages and also learned of recent events.</p>
<p>The most important thing was that another Guardian had appeared on the rankings. Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised by a Guardian’s appearance. What surprised him was that the Guardian on the rankings was named Burial Immortal.</p>
<p>Is Senior Jiang Yan finally taking action? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>However, Burial Immortal was only ranked third. He didn’t challenge the two Guardians ahead of him. Up to now, there hadn’t been any battles between Guardians.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen knew very well that a war between Guardians was inevitable. They would fight sooner or later.</p>
<p>Recently, Zhou Wen had also figured out some things. The Guardians were sent by the dimensional races to vie for control of Earth, so they likely wouldn’t want to destroy Earth wantonly. There was a high chance that their battle would be carried out inside the cube.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen even felt that this cube ranking battle was actually prepared for Guardians, not just meant to rank pets.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I haven’t advanced to the Mythical stage, so I can’t participate in the battle. If I want to kill those Guardians, I have to find them in reality, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>“You’re back?” A message came over. It was from Ya’er. Ya’er had probably seen his account come online and knew that Zhou Wen had returned.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly replied: “I just came back. I haven’t reached the city yet. I’ll pick you up now.”</p>
<p>“Waiting for you.” Ya’er replied.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to first head to the An family to fetch Ya’er.</p>
<p>As he walked, the mysterious phone suddenly vibrated. Zhou Wen was alarmed as he imagined that a new dimensional zone had appeared in the city. When he took it out, he realized that the fruit on the Dead Man Tree had ripened.</p>
<p>Xia Jiuhuang’s fruit has finally ripened. Zhou Wen was still looking forward to Xia Jiuhuang’s fruit.</p>
<p>After all, Xia Jiuhuang had already advanced to the Mythical stage back then. Furthermore, he had fused nine Life Providences and nine Life Souls. This was something ordinary humans didn’t possess.</p>
<p>Xia Jiuhuang still had all sorts of strange Essence Energy Skills. If all of this could be inherited by the Companion Beast, the Companion Beast’s abilities would definitely be extremely powerful.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the Companion Beasts born on the Dead Man Tree were unique. Zhou Wen felt that it wouldn’t disappoint him, so he looked at the fruit on the Dead Man Tree.</p>
<h3 id='chapter942'>Chapter 942: Evil Spirit King</h3>
<p>The fruit was unique, like a graphite fruit.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen plucked the fruit and immediately checked its stats.</p>
<p>Evil Spirit King: Mortal (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Strength: 11</p>
<p>Speed: 11</p>
<p>Constitution: 11</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 11</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Spirit Devouring</p>
<p>Companion Form: Soul</p>
<p>It’s the same soul state as Doctor Darkness. In other words, it can attach itself to me, strengthen my stats, and let me use its abilities. Unfortunately, it’s at the Mortal stage. Although it can evolve, it still needs some time to advance to the Mythical stage. Zhou Wen studied his only skill, Spirit Devouring, and realized that it wasn’t very practical, but it was a skill that was almost like a bug in computer games.</p>
<p>Spirit Devouring could only be used on creatures of the same level. Furthermore, the success rate wasn’t high. It might not succeed once in ten attempts. Even if one didn’t skip levels, there was a chance of a backlash from creatures of the same level.</p>
<p>When used on creatures higher than one’s level, it was basically a 100% failure rate.</p>
<p>However, the functionality of Spirit Devouring was extremely terrifying. It was like a bug.</p>
<p>When used on any creature, there was a certain chance of obtaining one of their skills. In other words, having the Spirit Devouring Skill was equivalent to having infinite skills. If one wanted a particular skill, they just needed to devour a particular dimensional creature.</p>
<p>If it advanced to the Mythical stage and combined with all sorts of impressive skills, it would be amazingly powerful.</p>
<p>I wonder what its Life Providence, Life Soul, and Wheel of Destiny are. Can they also be increased through devouring? Zhou Wen felt that it was unlikely. If that was the case, it would be fantastic.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen eagerly hatched the Evil Spirit King and saw a black puppet wearing a white mask appear in front of him.</p>
<p>His black clothes were like a devil’s gown. The mask on his face was smooth white, as though it was carved from bones. It looked very strange.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen attempted to feed it with Companion Eggs. The Evil Spirit King directly used the Devouring Skill. The palm wrapped in the black glove grabbed the Legendary Companion Egg and sucked it dry.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The Evil Spirit King’s body exploded. Its body was too weak, so it couldn’t receive the energy in an Legendary Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it’s in-game. If it was outside the game, this fellow would already be dead. From the looks of it, I can only use Mortal Companion Eggs to feed the Evil Spirit King. When he advances to the Legendary stage, I can use Legendary Companion Eggs to raise him. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but feel a headache when he thought of this.</p>
<p>It wasn’t difficult to obtain Legendary and Epic Companion Eggs, but Mortal Companion Eggs were really difficult to find. The chances of a Mortal Companion Egg dropping were too low. If one were to buy them in real life, they needed to pay a high price and it wasn’t easy to obtain them.</p>
<p>I hope he doesn’t need too many Companion Eggs to advance to the Legendary stage. Zhou Wen didn’t continue feeding the Evil Spirit King because he didn’t have any Mortal Companion Eggs. He could only farm for them in the future or spend money to buy them.</p>
<p>After arriving at the An family residence, An Tianzuo and An Sheng weren’t around. When Zhou Wen saw Ouyang Lan and Ya’er, he almost didn’t recognize Ya’er.</p>
<p>She was wearing a pink princess dress with a huge pink butterfly hair clip. She was hugging a Barbie doll in her arms as she sat on the sofa expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“How is it? She’s very cute, right? I spent a lot of effort to dress her up so beautifully. Don’t say that she’s not pretty,” Ouyang Lan said smugly.</p>
<p>“Can I take her back?” Although Zhou Wen didn’t find it ugly, it was somewhat different from Ya’er’s usual style.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen seemed to know why Ya’er had sent a message when she saw him online.</p>
<p>“What’s the rush? Let Ya’er stay here for a few more days. I still plan on taking her to the amusement park,” Ouyang Lan said.</p>
<p>Without waiting for Zhou Wen to speak, Ya’er had already stood up from the sofa and walked to Zhou Wen’s side. Clearly, she planned on returning with him.</p>
<p>“Perhaps another time,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>When Ouyang Lan saw that Ya’er wanted to leave, she didn’t force her to stay. However, she got someone to move out all the things she had bought for Ya’er. She instructed the driver to drive Ya’er to Zhou Wen’s dorm.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what the bags were. Since they were for Ya’er, he didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>After returning to her dorm, Ya’er changed into her usual clothes.</p>
<p>“Did you suffer at the An family?” Zhou Wen asked Ya’er.</p>
<p>Ya’er shook her head and said, “No, Sister Lan treated me very well.”</p>
<p>“That’s good.” Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief. However, when he heard Ya’er call Ouyang Lan Sis Lan, he couldn’t help but grumble inwardly. How obsessed are women with their youth and looks? Is it that difficult to admit that they are aging?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen planned on taking Ya’er out for a walk. The Glimmer Life Soul needed Zhou Wen to continue visiting unfamiliar places to advance to a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>As for the advancement method of Sword Pill, Zhou Wen hadn’t figured it out yet. He was still in the process of absorbing Essence Energy.</p>
<p>Before leaving Luoyang, Zhou Wen planned on learning a few skills. This was because after the Demon God Catalog’s Life Soul reached the Perfect Body, Zhou Wen’s Constitution finally reached 41 points. He had a few Mythical skill crystals to absorb.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen roughly sorted out the Mythical skill crystals he already had and could absorb.</p>
<p>Jade Lute Crystal: Constitution 41, Spatial 21.</p>
<p>Great Might Vajra Bull Crystal: Constitution: 41, Essence Energy: 41</p>
<p>National Cornerstone Gold Man Crystal: Essence Energy 41, Constitution 41</p>
<p>Black-Armored Golden Silk Turtle Crystal: Essence Energy 41, Constitution 41</p>
<p>Blue Sky Crystal Beast Crystal: Constitution: 41, Spatial: 21.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen searched and found that there were five Mythical crystals he could absorb in real life. The Mythical skill crystals that dropped in-game had long disappeared from respawning because he couldn’t absorb them back then.</p>
<p>These were obtained in reality, and his attributes had already met the requirements.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and absorbed the Jade Lute Crystal. As his stats had reached a certain level, the absorption process was very smooth. The Jade Lute Crystal quickly transformed into Essence Energy that formed a new Essence Energy circulation in Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>‘Absorbed Jade Lute Crystal. Attained Mythical Essence Energy Skill, String Aural Quake.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also obtained some information. It was as he had expected. It was a spatial skill, not an aural skill.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, String Aural Quake needed a string instrument as a weapon to be used. Without a similar instrument, this skill couldn’t be used.</p>
<p>Ordinary musical instruments naturally weren’t sufficient. They couldn’t withstand the vibrations of the Essence Energy and the strings would snap. Thankfully, Zhou Wen had a Golden Harp, so he could give it a try.</p>
<h3 id='chapter943'>Chapter 943: Ya</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to try. Instead, he continued absorbing and refining the other Mythical skill crystals.</p>
<p>The Mythical Essence Energy Crystals were absorbed by Zhou Wen as though they were free.</p>
<p>‘Absorbed Great Might Vajra Bull Crystal. Attained Mythical Essence Energy Skill: Vajra Drill.’</p>
<p>‘Absorbed National Cornerstone Gold Man Crystal. Attained Mythical Essence Energy Skill, Body of Gold Essence.’</p>
<p>‘Absorbed Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle Crystal. Attained Mythical Essence Energy Skill: Grand Turtle Breath.’</p>
<p>‘Absorbed Blue Sky Crystal Beast Crystal. Attained Mythical Essence Energy Skill: Sky Slash.’</p>
<p>Absorbing different Mythical Crystals required different Essence Energy Arts. Zhou Wen switched Essence Energy Arts several times and finally absorbed all the Mythical Crystals he could.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that the Great Might Vajra Bull’s skill wasn’t anything interesting because its strongest ability was the Soul Suppression Bell. However, the Soul Suppression Bell wasn’t a skill, so it was impossible for him to comprehend it.</p>
<p>He never expected the Great Might Vajra Bull to have the move, Vajra Drill. It was rather impressive, and it intrigued Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>This move was something the Great Might Vajra Bull used when going all out. It broke its horn and shot it out like a drill. Its might was rather domineering.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have a bull horn, but he didn’t need one when using the skill. All he needed to do was find a weapon that could be launched. He could use a spear or sword as long as he could throw them.</p>
<p>After the weapon was thrown, it would quickly spin and form a powerful drilling force. It was even better than Penetrating Pierce.</p>
<p>The key problem was that there was something wrong with this move. After throwing the weapon, it would automatically explode after hitting the target, maximizing its might. After using it once, it would destroy a weapon. An ordinary weapon wouldn’t be able to withstand such a powerful force. It might self-destruct before hitting the target.</p>
<p>Therefore, the weapon used for Vajra Drill couldn’t be too bad. Otherwise, it was very easy to miss.</p>
<p>Body of Gold Essence was a type of Essence Energy that strengthened the body. It was somewhat similar to Golden Bell and Iron Skin. However, it was of a higher level. It strengthened the body even more. It was a divine skill to suffer beatings.</p>
<p>Grand Turtle Breath was a high-level version of Turtle Breath. When he used it, there was no sign of life on his entire body. He was like a dead person.</p>
<p>However, he couldn’t move when using ordinary Turtle Breath, but for Grand Turtle Breath, he could still move freely. It was a necessary skill for feigning death.</p>
<p>Of course, he could also use it to deal with creatures with poor vision who relied on determining the enemy’s life auras to attack. He could also use it for hiding, making it difficult for him to be discovered.</p>
<p>Sky Slash left Zhou Wen somewhat disappointed. This was because Zhou Wen wanted a teleportation skill, but this was a spatial attack.</p>
<p>It was indeed very powerful. An Essence Energy skill that could slice through space was even more destructive than Zhou Wen’s Demonic Astral Wheel. However, Zhou Wen already had the even more destructive Immortal Slaying. He could use Sky Slash normally, but when he needed to go all out, he had to rely on the might of Immortal Slaying.</p>
<p>With so many Mythical skills, Zhou Wen’s combat strength increased significantly, especially with Vajra Drill. It was like an Essence Energy version of a missile. Its destructive power was rather shocking, provided that Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of sacrificing his weapon.</p>
<p>If he used it in-game, he wouldn’t have any qualms about using it. When the Mythical Light Concealment Sword was thrown out with Vajra Drill, its offensive strength was upgraded by a whole level. Furthermore, the final explosion was even more shocking.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen planned on using it in-game to kill bosses. In real life, to use such a move made the person a super tycoon. Zhou Wen wasn’t that rich.</p>
<p>The Body of Gold Essence was also very useful. Furthermore, it didn’t clash with the Demon Dragon True Body. Zhou Wen first used the Demon Dragon True Body before using the Body of Gold Essence. He looked like a humanoid golden dragon with a terrifying body. He could even clash head on with Tyrant Behemoth two or three times without being killed.</p>
<p>Of course, the Essence Energy expenditure was rather huge. Sometimes, he needed to switch back to Slaughterer to replenish it.</p>
<p>Sky Slash wasn’t as useless as Zhou Wen imagined. After Zhou Wen tried it, he realized that the expenditure of Sky Slash wasn’t high. It could be used continuously. It wasn’t like Immortal Slaying in which he would lose his combat strength after one strike. It was a form of compensation for its weaker strength.</p>
<p>Finally, Zhou Wen tried String Aural Quake again. The Golden Harp only struck once before the harp snapped. Thankfully, it was in-game, so there wasn’t any problem.</p>
<p>String Aural Quake was an area-of-effect attack skill. If a group of monsters needed to be cleared, this move was almost invincible.</p>
<p>I hope some useful skills drop in-game. Zhou Wen really wanted to stay at home and grind dungeons, but the Glimmer Life Soul needed him to walk out to advance. It left him helpless.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at maps online and planned on which direction he should take. He wanted to advance Glimmer to a Perfect Body as soon as possible. This was a critical step in advancing to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>“Why are you going out again?” Ouyang Lan asked when Zhou Wen told her that he was leaving Luoyang.</p>
<p>“It’s beneficial to go out and broaden my horizons. Now that the dimensional zones in the Federation are becoming more and more unstable, I wonder if I’ll have the chance to leave again in the future,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That’s true. Send Ya’er over. I’ll help you take care of her,” Ouyang Lan said.</p>
<p>“I plan on taking her out for a walk with me this time,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“She’s still so young. What if you encounter danger?” Ouyang Lan said worriedly. It was obvious that she really liked Ya’er.</p>
<p>“I’ll take routes I’m confident in. Besides, you should be able to tell that Ya’er isn’t an ordinary child,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Alright, be careful. Stay away from taking risks…” Ouyang Lan exhorted again.</p>
<p>After informing the others, Zhou Wen was about to leave Luoyang when he suddenly heard a piece of news. Someone had challenged the first ranked Great Skyfiend.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly switched on his phone and couldn’t help but be taken aback when he saw the challenger.</p>
<p>The challenger also looked like a human, but he was wearing clothes that resembled a cloak. Beneath the cloak was an airtight armor, making it impossible to see what the creature inside looked like.</p>
<p>However, his clothes and armor weren’t Guardian armor. Furthermore, there was a white “Ya” embroidered on the back of the cloak.</p>
<p>And the name on the cube only had one word: Ya.</p>
<p>What surprised the Federation citizens was that Ya held an ancient sword in his hand. Ya wasn’t famous, but the ancient sword was very famous.</p>
<p>In the previous ranking battle, Primordial Sword Immortal, who had been invincible against everyone overseas, was now in Ya’s hands.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also alarmed, but what shocked him wasn’t the Primordial Sword Immortal in Ya’s hand, but that Ya looked like someone to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me it’s Zhong Ziya! Zhou Wen prayed inwardly.</p>
<p>If it was really Zhong Ziya, he might have already taken Wang Mingyuan’s path. This was because Ya’s condition was clearly different from the Guardians.</p>
<h3 id='chapter944'>Chapter 944: Sea Return</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen’s phone suddenly rang. He looked at the number and saw that it was from Hui Haifeng.</p>
<p>After the call connected, Hui Haifeng’s solemn voice sounded. “Zhou Wen, are you looking at the cube’s challenge?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“Don’t you find that Ya a little familiar?” Hui Haifeng asked again.</p>
<p>“You also think he looks like Zhong Ziya?” Zhou Wen said directly.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng fell silent for a moment before saying, “He seems to have Teacher’s shadow on him.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally believed that he was reading too much into it, but now, even Hui Haifeng thought so. It looked like there was a high chance that Zhong Ziya had chosen an extremely difficult path.</p>
<p>“Perhaps we are reading too much into it. Perhaps that isn’t Zhong Ziya at all,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng said with a bitter smile, “The possibility of us making a recognition mistake at the same time is slim. It’s best we make plans early. Running away won’t solve the problem.”</p>
<p>“What do you have in mind?” Zhou Wen asked. He didn’t even know where Zhong Ziya was, nor could he think of any solutions.</p>
<p>“Do you still remember the question Teacher asked us back then?” Hui Haifeng asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, two paths,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“I want to try the first one,” Hui Haifeng said.</p>
<p>“How?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“In the dimensional zones, we discovered quite a number of strange materials. For example, common materials like Essence Gold and Essence Crystals. There are also some that aren’t common. I want to try and see if I can figure out something that can fight dimensional creatures. Humans have used their intelligence to become the masters of Earth for thousands of years. Perhaps this time, we can still rely on our intelligence to win,” Hui Haifeng said.</p>
<p>“This path isn’t easy.” Zhou Wen knew how difficult this path was. The An family had invested so many resources, but the things they had researched weren’t very useful against Mythical creatures.</p>
<p>“Someone has to walk over to the edge to see if that’s the end of the world,” Hui Haifeng said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Then walk the path. Perhaps there’s a new world ahead,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I don’t care if there’s a new world. I just want to keep the past.” Hui Haifeng paused before saying to Zhou Wen, “Wen, don’t take that path.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew which path Hui Haifeng was referring to, but he fell silent. He didn’t know if he would take that path.</p>
<p>If the Lost Immortal Sutra didn’t work, he had to choose between a Guardian and Spirit Casting. Zhou Wen felt that he might choose the Spirit Casting path, so he couldn’t answer Hui Haifeng.</p>
<p>After a long silence, Hui Haifeng finally broke it with a soft sigh. “Alright, if you really take that path one day, I hope that you can still see me when you want to turn back.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen forced a smile and said, “You make it sound like I’m walking on a path of no return. I have my own path. If my luck isn’t too bad, I probably won’t choose that path. Don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“Come to Sea Return to visit me when you have the time. I’ll treat you to some rare seafood.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I plan on traveling soon.”</p>
<p>The two of them tacitly stopped the previous topic and agreed to meet at Sea Return.</p>
<p>Although Sea Return and Sea Gazing City’s names were similar, their positions were very different. Sea Gazing City bordered the East Sea, while Sea Return bordered the South Sea.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen remembered that Feng Qiuyan came from Sea Return. Furthermore, the Feng family was rather famous there.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wondered if he should inform Feng Qiuyan and see if he wanted to return with him. That way, he could have a guide.</p>
<p>Now was clearly not the time to think about this. Zhou Wen watched the livestream again. Great Skyfiend didn’t accept the challenge. The countdown to accepting the challenge was only twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>After waiting for half an hour, he still didn’t see Great Skyfiend accept the challenge. Zhou Wen called Feng Qiuyan and told him that he was heading to Sea Return soon. He asked if he wanted to go with him.</p>
<p>“Coach, it’s not very peaceful over at Sea Return. There are often break-out creatures coming ashore. Many people have moved inland. Why are you going to Sea Return?” Feng Qiuyan asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“I have a senior over there. I want to visit him,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Those who remain in Sea Return now are basically those who have family businesses there. That senior shouldn’t be an ordinary person, right?” Feng Qiuyan asked.</p>
<p>“Hui Haifeng,” Zhou Wen said his name.</p>
<p>“As expected. The Hui family has quite a number of mineral mines in Sea Return. They are also most determined to defend Sea Return.” Feng Qiuyan explained the situation to Zhou Wen in detail.</p>
<p>The situation was worse than Zhou Wen had imagined. Apart from the cities guarded by humans, most of the areas had break-out creatures. It was almost impossible to distinguish between dimensional zones and non-dimensional zones.</p>
<p>There were many break-out creatures that came out of the sea. Furthermore, they were very difficult to deal with. Sea Return had three relatively large families taking the lead. Together with more than ten small families, they formed the forces of Sea Return City that had been fighting the break-out creatures all this time.</p>
<p>The Hui family and the Feng family were two of the bigger families. Feng Qiuyan came from the Sea Return Feng family.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan got Zhou Wen to wait. He wanted to apply for leave from school before accompanying Zhou Wen back to the sea.</p>
<p>As the two of them were talking, there was a sudden commotion on the cube. Great Skyfiend accepted the challenge and descended into the cube arena in the void.</p>
<p>Everyone’s gaze was immediately attracted by Great Skyfiend. The scene of Great Skyfiend destroying Heavy-Armored Titan with one strike surfaced in many people’s minds.</p>
<p>Ya stood in the arena and calmly looked at Great Skyfiend as though he didn’t know how terrifying it was.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao had been in a bad mood recently. Her progress in Luoyang hadn’t been smooth. She had already tried many solutions, but she was unable to obtain any information regarding the Essence Energy weapons from the An family.</p>
<p>Although she had seen An Tianzuo a few times, he never talked shop at home.</p>
<p>Back in the An family residence, An Tianzuo wasn’t as domineering as the rumors said. He was no different from an ordinary young man.</p>
<p>Not only was there no progress in the mission, but she was also continuously challenged. This made her somewhat vexed.</p>
<p>Although Uesugi Nao chose to accept the challenge, she didn’t dare let her guard down.</p>
<p>She had already seen Primordial Sword Immortal’s might the previous time. It was an existence even more terrifying than Orochi. Now that someone had entered the rankings with Primordial Sword Immortal, this person was likely similar to her—someone who had contracted a Guardian.</p>
<p>However, Uesugi Nao couldn’t tell if Ya was someone who had used a Guardian. Typically, when people with Guardians fought, Guardians would fuse with humans. They would be donning Guardian armor, but Ya was wearing a Companion Beast armor.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao accepted the challenge because she wanted to know the origins of Ya.</p>
<h3 id='chapter945'>Chapter 945: Purgatory Fiend Flames</h3>
<p>Apart from knowing that her opponent was the owner of Primordial Immortal Sword, Uesugi Nao knew nothing about Ya, so she didn’t dare to be careless. She summoned the Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi formed by Orochi.</p>
<p>With the augmentation of Great Skyfiend’s power, a terrifying demonic aura appeared over Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi.</p>
<p>Ya didn’t say a word. He held Primordial Immortal Sword and didn’t pull it out. Instead, he slashed at Uesugi Nao with the sword sheathed, making it appear like a heavy sword.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao was not to be outdone. She brandished her Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi to meet Ya’s Primordial Immortal Sword.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The two swords clashed and the two terrifying forces collided, producing a terrifying explosion and shockwave. However, neither of them retreated as they quickly brandished their swords again.</p>
<p>Fast. It was just too fast. The two of them had reached the peak of the Mythical stage. They were so fast that ordinary humans couldn’t see their battle.</p>
<p>All people could see were streams of light crisscrossing like sudden bolts of lightning. They flashed and vanished. Their figures couldn’t be seen, much less the sword moves.</p>
<p>Only a very small number of Epic experts with special sight-type skills or people with high-level sight-type Companion Beasts could see their battle clearly.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw Ya’s sword technique, he was even more certain that he was Zhong Ziya. His sword technique was unrestrained and unbridled. Only someone with Zhong Ziya’s personality could master such a sword technique to its limits.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao’s sword technique was actually more like a saber technique. It was also a model of swiftness, ruthlessness, and accuracy. Although Zhou Wen had previously fought her, it wasn’t a real battle. Now, he finally understood her strength. She undoubtedly had the standards of a top Mythical.</p>
<p>Of course, this was under the premise of fusing with Great Skyfiend. Without Great Skyfiend, Uesugi Nao was only at the Epic stage just like him.</p>
<p>However, a Guardian was a part of one’s strength. Just like how humans used pistols in the past. If one had good marksmanship, they could also be considered one of the strong.</p>
<p>Companion Beasts and Guardians shared the same principle. One’s own strength and external strength weren’t differentiated. Be it one’s own strength or external strength, as long as one could use it well, they were experts.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao’s ability to perfectly control Great Skyfiend’s power meant that she was indeed very strong.</p>
<p>The Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi and Primordial Immortal Sword constantly clashed. No one had the upper hand. Their techniques were mainly focused on attacking. There was basically no defense. Every strike looked abnormally perilous. It was pure offense that only allowed for one outcome—one of them had to die while the other lived.</p>
<p>After a while, Uesugi Nao realized that she was at a disadvantage. It wasn’t because her strength and technique were inferior to Ya’s, but because Ya’s speed was getting faster and faster. His strength was also getting stronger. The continuous battle didn’t seem to consume his strength and stamina. Instead, it made him even more ferocious and domineering.</p>
<p>The other party is good at prolonged battles. Uesugi Nao immediately realized that she couldn’t delay any further. People who were good at prolonged battles would definitely become stronger the longer they fought. If this dragged on, it would be very disadvantageous for her.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Uesugi Nao gathered her strength and slashed out Great Skyfiend’s Infinite Fiend Abyss. Black demonic aura transformed into darkness as it tore out and slashed at Ya.</p>
<p>Wherever the black demonic aura went, everything turned into darkness. In the blink of an eye, the cube’s screen turned black and nothing could be seen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly got up and ran towards the cube in the city. This was because the broadcast didn’t allow him to see through the darkness. He had to reach the cube to see what was happening inside the darkness.</p>
<p>The cube arena in the void was completely enveloped by darkness. As for Ya, his vision, hearing, and sense of smell in the darkness had been stripped away. Even when the blade slashed at him, he couldn’t feel anything, much less feel pain.</p>
<p>Looking at Ya, who was standing in the arena with a sword in hand, Uesugi Nao mercilessly slashed with her blade.</p>
<p>She knew that in the Infinite Fiend Abyss, her opponent’s senses would be stripped away. However, she wasn’t sure if her opponent had the ability to nullify Infinite Fiend Abyss. Therefore, she had to kill her opponent as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>However, Ya moved in the darkness. Primordial Immortal Sword accurately blocked Uesugi Nao’s Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi.</p>
<p>The blades constantly clashed. The Infinite Fiend Abyss wasn’t cracked, but Ya didn’t seem to be affected at all. He didn’t make any mistakes.</p>
<p>He has an ability that transcends the normal senses. Uesugi Nao immediately guessed the reason. In the Infinite Fiend Abyss, only people who had extra-sensory perception could be unaffected.</p>
<p>Unless Uesugi Nao could make Great Skyfiend break through to the Terror grade, Infinite Fiend Abyss was almost useless against people with extra-sensory perception.</p>
<p>After figuring this out, Uesugi Nao no longer wasted her Essence Energy and directly deactivated Infinite Fiend Abyss.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen arrived above the cube, Uesugi Nao had already dispelled Infinite Fiend Abyss, revealing their figures again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wore the Invisibility Cloak and floated in the air as he watched the battle on the cube’s arena. Such a battle was already the pinnacle of humanity. The only pity was that they weren’t fighting purely with human strength.</p>
<p>Ya’s offensive was like a tidal wave. He didn’t have many tricks, nor did he have any complicated skills. He was just one man and one sword. He was presumptuous and arrogant. He relentlessly attacked, as if the word “defense” didn’t exist in his dictionary.</p>
<p>Seeing that Infinite Fiend Abyss didn’t have any effect, Uesugi Nao didn’t hesitate to use another of Great Skyfiend’s Mythical technique, Purgatory Fiend Flames.</p>
<p>The moment the sword slashed out, the demonic aura on the sword burned and turned into terrifying fiend flames. Uesugi Nao had used this move to instantly kill Heavy-Armored Titan.</p>
<p>It’s finally here! Zhou Wen stared at Uesugi Nao’s strike. He naturally knew that it was this move that had killed Heavy-Armored Titan.</p>
<p>However, no one knew what the exact function of this move was, nor did they know how to crack it.</p>
<p>If it were Zhou Wen, his movement technique was excellent. He wouldn’t need to take the risk and could directly dodge before counterattacking. That would prevent Uesugi Nao from hitting him.</p>
<p>However, Ya clearly did not share Zhou Wen’s habits. His sword didn’t seem to have the option of retreating or dodging. Primordial Immortal Sword continued advancing crazily.</p>
<p>The six families and many wealthy families stared intently at the two combatants. Even the great devils overseas were somewhat nervous.</p>
<p>Everyone wanted to know if Great Skyfiend’s one-hit kill of Heavy-Armored Titan could kill Ya.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi and Primordial Immortal Sword collided fiercely. The Purgatory Fiend Flames on the Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi immediately spread to Primordial Immortal Sword. Besides that, even Ya’s clothes, armor, and body began to burn with fiend flames.</p>
<h3 id='chapter946'>Chapter 946: Top Rank Changes</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Oh no, he didn’t block it. Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>Will the same thing happen again? Zhang Chunqiu looked at Ya, who was burning with fiend flames, and muttered to himself with a frown.</p>
<p>Many people in the six families were very disappointed. Although they didn’t know who Ya was, there was no doubt that Uesugi Nao was from overseas. Most people still supported Ya.</p>
<p>However, Ya’s body didn’t explode like the Heavy-Armored Titan. Although his body was burning with fiend flames, he was still brandishing his sword to attack. The terrifying fiend flames seemed like an illusion that didn’t exist. They failed to damage his body.</p>
<p>After blocking a few more strikes, Uesugi Nao realized that Ya hadn’t exploded. Even his clothes and armor weren’t burned. She was filled with puzzlement.</p>
<p>How can there be no reaction? Could there really be a sinless person in this world? No way. He must have the ability to restrain the Purgatory Fiend Flames that prevented him from being killed. Uesugi Nao felt depressed.</p>
<p>The Purgatory Fiend Flames were extremely powerful, but there was a condition. That person had to commit a sin before the Purgatory Fiend Flames could be effective.</p>
<p>Pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed, gluttony, lust, and so on were all Original Sins. No one in the world had no Original Sin at all. Therefore, the Purgatory Fiend Flames were practically invincible against humans. The heavier the Original Sins, the stronger the damage target received.</p>
<p>Back then, Heavy-Armored Titan had been killed by the Purgatory Fiend Flames because its owner had committed too many massacres. Furthermore, it had also committed the sins of wrath and gluttony. This led to its explosion.</p>
<p>However, Ya was completely unaffected. Uesugi Nao found it impossible.</p>
<p>Soon, the people from the Federation and overseas realized that Great Skyfiend’s attack didn’t seem to have any effect on Ya. The people from the Federation were naturally overjoyed, but the great devils overseas had solemn expressions.</p>
<p>The battle continued. The situation was already somewhat disadvantageous for Uesugi Nao. She knew that she had to defeat Ya as soon as possible. Time wasn’t on her side.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I can only use Great Skyfiend’s Wheel of Destiny. Uesugi Nao made up her mind as she stared at Ya through her visor. The demonic aura on her body quickly converged.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Uesugi Nao’s figure vanished. When she appeared again, she was already behind Ya.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Ya’s body had been sliced apart at the waist at some point in time.</p>
<p>Everyone was horrified. Even Zhou Wen couldn’t tell how Uesugi Nao had killed Ya. It wasn’t a matter of speed. No matter how fast a Mythical creature was, it was impossible for Zhou Wen, who had powerful eyesight, to not see its trajectory.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen really didn’t see anything. Uesugi Nao’s body seemed to vanish when she completed the strike.</p>
<p>It wasn’t teleportation either. This was because attacks could only be delivered after completing the teleportation. As for Uesugi Nao’s strike, it was completed when she disappeared. This was different from teleportation.</p>
<p>Many experts from the Federation felt their hearts turn cold as they felt a chill run down their spines. If Uesugi Nao used this strike against them, few had the confidence of dodging it.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao’s expression didn’t look good when she saw Ya’s body split into two. This was because she felt that something was amiss when she killed Ya. She quickly retreated.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the two halves of the corpse turned into a broken puppet. The other Ya appeared where he had been standing when he first entered the arena.</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned. They couldn’t believe that Ya, who had fought with Uesugi Nao for so long, was actually a puppet.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao’s expression turned nasty. She had already used her strongest strike, so it was impossible for her to deliver a second strike in a short period of time. Now, she understood why the Purgatory Fiend Flames were useless against Ya. It was because it wasn’t Ya, but a puppet.</p>
<p>Primordial Immortal Sword automatically returned to the true Ya’s hand. He held the Primordial Immortal Sword and stared at Uesugi Nao like a devil.</p>
<p>At that moment, everyone felt that Ya was as powerful as a devil. This wasn’t a feeling brought about by strength, but a psychological pressure.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether Ya’s true strength could defeat Uesugi Nao, his ability to toy with his opponent was even more terrifying than his true destructive power.</p>
<p>The unknown was most terrifying. Once a certain power was known by others and had psychological expectations, the horror instilled would decrease. The present Ya felt unfathomable and terrifying.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao didn’t hesitate and chose to forfeit. She knew very well that she had lost this time because of the unequal intelligence between them. If she continued fighting, there was only death.</p>
<p>If she wanted to defeat her opponent, she had to first figure out her opponent’s abilities. She no longer had that chance.</p>
<p>With Uesugi Nao’s withdrawal, the first name on the ranking became Ya. As for Great Skyfiend, it retreated to second place. All the Guardians and Companion Beasts on the ranking automatically dropped by one.</p>
<p>Ya’s entire body was covered, and no one could tell what expression he had. After obtaining victory, he left the void arena.</p>
<p>“He’s really too strong. As expected of the owner of Primordial Sword Immortal. Just a puppet made Great Skyfiend retreat.”</p>
<p>“He’s practically invincible. Primordial Sword Immortal is powerful, but its owner is even more terrifying. I don’t think there will be any more surprises in this ranking battle, right?”</p>
<p>The citizens of the Federation were amazed at Ya’s strength. This name quickly spread throughout the Federation. Some people viewed him as a hero.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t think so. Ya was indeed very strong, but the combat strength displayed by Uesugi Nao was also very terrifying. It could only be said that Ya won because of his successful strategy.</p>
<p>However, the same strategy might not succeed a second time. Therefore, it was difficult to say if he could maintain first place.</p>
<p>After returning to campus, Zhou Wen saw many reports regarding Ya. As Ya was likely from the Federation, the various media outlets of the Federation touted Ya as a hero. They held him in high esteem, raising the enthusiasm of the Federation citizens. They kept guessing who Ya was.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen read the report, he smiled bitterly to himself. If Ya is really Zhong Ziya, it’s hard to tell if he’s a hero or a devil to the Federation.</p>
<p>The battle between the two pumped zeal and ardor through Zhou Wen’s vessels. He had the urge to fight personally.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen quickly regained his rationality. He felt that grinding dungeons was more practical. Unfortunately, he couldn’t find opponents like Ya and Great Skyfiend in-game.</p>
<p>If only I could scan them into the game, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>After Feng Qiuyan applied for leave, the three of them were prepared to set off. To their surprise, after hearing of the matter, Li Xuan joined them. They set off as a group of four.</p>
<p>“After watching Ya and Great Skyfiend’s battle, I feel like getting a Guardian to play with.” On the way, Li Xuan mentioned the battle.</p>
<p>“Guardians are external forces after all. It’s not good.” Feng Qiuyan clearly rejected Guardians. He wished to become stronger by himself.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, what do you think? How does it feel to have a Guardian?” Li Xuan asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I’ve only killed a few Guardians and never had one,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>2</p>
<h3 id='chapter947'>Chapter 947: Unable to Walk Straight</h3>
<p>“Coach is indeed Coach. You’ve already killed so many Guardians? Can you teach me how to kill Guardians?” Feng Qiuyan said in admiration.</p>
<p>“Is this even a normal chat?” Li Xuan was somewhat speechless.</p>
<p>The four of them set off together. Zhou Wen had already walked the first part of the journey, but now, it felt different from before.</p>
<p>Not only were many roads destroyed, but after leaving the city, the chances of encountering break-out creatures increased significantly. Many break-out creatures were only at the Legendary stage. The reason they could break out was clearly because the dimensional zones’ seals had weakened, not because they were strong enough.</p>
<p>The further away they were from the city, the denser the plants grew. The environment that had been destroyed by humans in the past had not only recovered, but it had also become terrifying. The plants had mutated. Although they hadn’t reached the standards of dimensional creatures, they had become extremely huge.</p>
<p>Large trees that were dozens of meters tall and flowers that were more than a meter in diameter were rather common now. Most of the paths were awash with plants.</p>
<p>Furthermore, new dimensional zones were constantly appearing. It was very possible that a spot he passed this time was fine, yet it could become a dimensional zone the next time he came here.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan, what are you up to?” Zhou Wen saw that Li Xuan had suddenly turned odd.</p>
<p>“I didn’t do anything?” Li Xuan looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement, unsure what he meant.</p>
<p>“If you aren’t doing anything, why are you walking so weirdly?” Zhou Wen stared at Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“I’m not walking weirdly. I’m walking very normally,” Li Xuan said as he took another step.</p>
<p>However, this step immediately made Li Xuan’s expression change. This was because he clearly wanted to walk straight forward, but to his surprise, he took a diagonal step and blocked Zhou Wen’s path.</p>
<p>“That’s impossible. I’m not senile. It’s impossible that I can’t even walk straight…” Li Xuan refused to believe it as he took a few more steps. However, every step he took was diagonal. None of them were straight.</p>
<p>“What the hell… There’s something strange here… Try walking… There’s no way to walk in a straight line here…” Li Xuan’s expression turned nasty. He checked himself but didn’t discover any problems.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan and Zhou Wen took two steps. They walked very straight without any signs of walking diagonally.</p>
<p>“It’s completely fine,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe it.” Seeing that Zhou Wen and Feng Qiuyan were fine, Li Xuan took two more steps.</p>
<p>Li Xuan tried his best to control his footsteps. He had already used his Essence Energy, but after he stepped out, he went diagonal again. He couldn’t walk straight.</p>
<p>“President, stop teasing us. We still have a long journey ahead of us,” Feng Qiuyan said.</p>
<p>Li Xuan felt like crying. “What’s wrong with me? I really can’t walk straight.”</p>
<p>“But we have no problems,” Feng Qiuyan said as he took a few steps back. He walked very straight.</p>
<p>Li Xuan suddenly stared at Feng Qiuyan as though he had discovered something. He said loudly, “Wait, Little Yanyan. Don’t walk in a straight line. Walk diagonally.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with walking diagonally? It’s very easy,” Feng Qiuyan said as he took a step forward diagonally.</p>
<p>However, when he took this step, his feet walked straight ahead. This step was so straight that even a ceremonial guard’s standard marching wasn’t as straight as his.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Feng Qiuyan was somewhat dumbfounded. He gathered his Essence Energy and attempted to take a few more steps, but the outcome was the same. No matter how hard he tried to walk diagonally, he ended up walking in a straight line.</p>
<p>“I knew it. There’s definitely something odd here,” Li Xuan shouted.</p>
<p>The two of them looked at Zhou Wen at the same time. One of them could only walk diagonally while the other could only walk in a straight line. Now, they wanted to know how it was with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried walking, but he could only walk in a straight line. If he wanted to walk diagonally, he couldn’t walk out no matter what. He walked forward the moment he moved his feet.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried walking backward again, but he soon realized that he couldn’t.</p>
<p>“Take a look at the map. Where is this place?” Zhou Wen had already realized that something was amiss, but he was even more certain now.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was already looking at it on his phone. This was an old map he had downloaded. It wasn’t for navigation, but to see if there were any legendary scenic spots on the map.</p>
<p>“There doesn’t seem to be anything special nearby. It’s just an ordinary mountainous area. Could it be that an unknown dimensional zone has appeared here? Or has some dimensional creature affected this place?” Li Xuan looked at the map for a while but didn’t discover any problems.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried switching to the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder before taking two more steps. He realized that he could now retreat and walk diagonally.</p>
<p>“How are you able to walk diagonally again?” Li Xuan asked in surprise when he saw Zhou Wen take two steps diagonally.</p>
<p>“I have an ability that can restrain the taboos of dimensional zones. From the looks of it, this place has transformed into a dimensional zone. However, I wonder where we entered.” Zhou Wen sized up his surroundings and saw mountains and rivers. The scenery wasn’t bad, but he didn’t discover any dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>“Since it’s a dimensional zone, let’s walk forward. It just prevents me from walking straight, so it’s not a big deal,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>His strength didn’t rely on movement techniques to begin with, so the restriction of movement was nothing to him.</p>
<p>“What about you?” Zhou Wen asked Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t have much of an impact,” Feng Qiuyan said.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s continue walking forward,” Zhou Wen said as he summoned a Poison Bat, hoping to get it to scout ahead.</p>
<p>However, after the Poison Bat was summoned, it fell to the ground, unable to fly no matter how hard it struggled.</p>
<p>“There’s a taboo here that prevents flight,” Li Xuan said in surprise.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to unsummon the Poison Bat before summoning a Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior to scout ahead.</p>
<p>The Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior didn’t have any problems, but he could only walk in a straight line. He couldn’t walk diagonally.</p>
<p>The Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior walked far ahead while Zhou Wen and company followed behind. Zhou Wen and Feng Qiuyan were fine, but Li Xuan could only walk diagonally. It was extremely awkward.</p>
<p>They walked for quite some time without discovering any dimensional creatures. The Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior had already walked to the river in front of them and was about to cross it.</p>
<p>As they couldn’t fly, they had no choice but to cross the river. Zhou Wen was afraid that there would be something odd in the river, so he got the Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior to head into the river as they watched by the edge.</p>
<p>The river wasn’t deep. The deepest part only reached the waist of the Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior. There wasn’t any problem when the Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior crossed the river.</p>
<p>However, just as he reached the opposite bank, a bang was heard.</p>
<h3 id='chapter948'>Chapter 948: Chinese Chess Dimensional Zone</h3>
<p>The Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior’s body shattered into pieces. At the same time, a dimensional creature that looked like a squirrel landed and stood in the wreckage blasted open by the Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, that little squirrel is so strong!” Li Xuan’s eyes nearly popped out.</p>
<p>He had seen Runic Heavy-Armored Warriors before. Although they were only at the Epic stage, their defense was extremely powerful. It wasn’t easy for Mythical creatures with weaker offensive strength to break through their Runic Heavy-Armored Armor, much less shatter them directly. Only a powerful Mythical creature like Tyrant Behemoth could do so.</p>
<p>However, this tiny squirrel looked inconspicuous. He never expected it to have such terrifying strength.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found it unbelievable as well. He immediately used Truth Listener to observe the tiny squirrel. No matter how he looked at it, it didn’t look like a dimensional creature that could kill a Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior with one strike.</p>
<p>“Something’s amiss. Perhaps it’s not that the squirrel is strong, but the taboo of this dimensional zone,” Zhou Wen said as he stared at the squirrel on the opposite bank.</p>
<p>Li Xuan suddenly thought of something and suddenly said to Zhou Wen, “Old Zhou, your reconnaissance abilities are strong. Look behind that squirrel. Are there any other dimensional creatures in a straight line?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded and extended Truth Listener’s ability. Indeed, he discovered a gray rabbit squatting further away. It was in a very straight line from the squirrel.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen told Li Xuan this outcome and Li Xuan immediately exclaimed, “I understand. This dimensional zone’s taboo might be related to Chinese chess.”</p>
<p>“Chinese chess?” Zhou Wen didn’t know how to play Chinese chess, so he asked Li Xuan what he meant.</p>
<p>Li Xuan explained, “You don’t know how to play Chinese chess. Otherwise, it would be easy for you to figure out that in the rules of Chinese chess, different pieces have different ways of motion. Horse moves in an L shape while Elephant moves in a shape similar to an L, but with both sides equal in length, like two sides of a square. They are the most representative. For example, I can only walk diagonally. I’m guessing that it might be one of the two or another type of Advisor. Little Yanyan can only walk in a straight line, so he might be a Chariot or Cannon. You can only walk in a straight line and can’t retreat. You should be a Soldier in Chinese chess. You can only advance but not retreat.”</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan thought for a moment and said, “President, what you said makes sense. If this is really a dimensional zone following Chinese chess rules, it can explain why a tiny squirrel can instantly kill a Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior. This is because in Chinese chess, all the pieces have single lives. Regardless of whether one is strong or weak, one will die if they are hit.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know the rules of Chinese chess. Do you have a solution?” Zhou Wen asked the two of them.</p>
<p>“I only know a few rules. I’m not good at it. How about you, Little Yanyan?” Li Xuan asked Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan thought for a moment and answered, “My grandfather likes to play Chinese chess very much, so I learned it from a young age. However, I’m only average. Furthermore, there is no chess board here, only rules. It’s still a little different from real Chinese chess. I wonder if it will work.”</p>
<p>“Let’s try using Companion Beasts first. Tell me what to do.” Zhou Wen summoned another Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior.</p>
<p>When Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan saw the spot where Zhou Wen summoned the Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior, they shouted at the same time, “Quick, dodge.”</p>
<p>The Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior that Zhou Wen summoned was in front of him, forming a straight line with the squirrel.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The squirrel tore through the air and struck the spot where Zhou Wen had been standing. Thankfully, with Feng Qiuyan and Li Xuan’s warning, Zhou Wen had dodged in advance. Otherwise, the outcome would have been unimaginable.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“This little squirrel should be a Cannon in Chinese chess. It needs a chess piece to be in the way to launch an attack,” Feng Qiuyan explained.</p>
<p>With that said, Feng Qiuyan moved to a spot that was a straight line away from the little squirrel and attacked. Just as his saber touched the little squirrel, its body exploded.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, I represent Chariot.” Feng Qiuyan thought for a moment and said to Zhou Wen, “Coach, we need some chess pieces now. Summon more Companion Beasts. They don’t need to be too strong. Legendary ones will do. Let’s first determine what they represent in Chinese chess before figuring out what chess pieces are on the other side of the river.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had many Companion Beasts, but he really had very few Legendary Companion Beasts. As they weren’t of much value, he seldom hatched them. Typically, he directly fed them to pets.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned some Epic Companion Beasts and Li Xuan said, “Old Zhou, there’s no need to be so extravagant. Just a few worthless Legendary Companion Beasts will do.”</p>
<p>“These are already my most worthless Companion Beasts. Feel free to use them. It’s useless to keep them anyway. I still have plenty,” Zhou Wen said as he summoned some Companion Beasts. They were also at the Epic stage.</p>
<p>However, after summoning twelve, Zhou Wen realized that he couldn’t summon any more Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>“I suddenly realized that we aren’t on the same frequency,” Li Xuan said with an aggrieved look.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan counted the number of Companion Beasts and said, “From the looks of it, there’s nothing wrong about this dimensional zone following Chinese chess rules. There are sixteen pieces for each side. Twelve Companion Beasts plus the four of us makes sixteen. Now, we have to figure out what pieces these Companion Beasts represent. Coach, try getting them to walk.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen made the Companion Beasts move. According to their movement, Feng Qiuyan quickly determined what pieces they represented.</p>
<p>“If my judgment is right, Ya’er might very well represent the General. Coach, you have to protect her no matter what. If the General dies, it means game over. No one knows what the outcome will be,” Feng Qiuyan said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen nodded. Although he had roughly understood the rules, chess was a skill. Knowing the rules wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>“Now, we need to know what’s on the other side. Coach, look at what dimensional creatures there are,” Feng Qiuyan said as he looked across the river.</p>
<p>Truth Listener played its role. Zhou Wen told Feng Qiuyan about the various dimensional creatures that had appeared across the river. However, they were all small animals like rats, sheep, cats, and dogs. They didn’t look very strong.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan thought for a moment and said, “Now, we don’t know what chess pieces those dimensional creatures represent. We can only test them in actual combat. When the time comes, it’s inevitable that some chess pieces will be sacrificed.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. They are all unimportant Companion Beasts,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan nodded. Just as he was about to get a Companion Beast to cross the river, he suddenly heard a voice from the other side of the river. “Interesting. I never expected there to be someone proficient in the Way of Chinese chess among the youths these days. How rare.”</p>
<p>The three of them were slightly taken aback as they looked towards the opposite bank. They saw an old man sitting on a boulder that was more than ten meters tall. He was staring at them with his eyes glowing.</p>
<p>“Human?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.</p>
<h3 id='chapter949'>Chapter 949: Cheating</h3>
<p>It wasn’t strange for a human to appear in such a place. The strange thing was that the dimensional creatures on the opposite bank didn’t show him any animosity. Furthermore, Zhou Wen had a vague feeling that the dimensional creatures were mainly led by the elder.</p>
<p>“Grandpa, why are you here alone?” Li Xuan shouted.</p>
<p>The elder ignored Li Xuan and looked at Feng Qiuyan. “Since you know Chinese chess, play a round with me. You can leave alive if you win.”</p>
<p>“Grandpa, you are also a human. Why are you making things difficult for your own kind?” Li Xuan shouted again.</p>
<p>The elder sneered and said, “Whether you are human or not has nothing to do with me. Since you are here, you only have two choices. Win or die.”</p>
<p>“Why is this old fellow so inhumane?” Li Xuan muttered.</p>
<p>The elder continued, “The rat is Elephant, the fox is Advisor…”</p>
<p>He told Feng Qiuyan which chess pieces were represented by which various dimensional creatures before saying, “I’m the General The rules are somewhat different from the old Chinese chess. There’s no limit to the number of steps. As long as you have the ability, you can simultaneously move as many pieces as you can.”</p>
<p>With that said, the dimensional creatures moved according to the elder’s orders.</p>
<p>Unlike real Chinese chess, they didn’t take a step turn after turn. When the elder gave the order, many dimensional creatures moved at the same time.</p>
<p>As the Companion Beasts weren’t Feng Qiuyan’s, Feng Qiuyan could only inform Zhou Wen to get him to control the movement of the Companion Beasts. This naturally slowed things down.</p>
<p>But even so, Feng Qiuyan wasn’t at a disadvantage. Their chess pieces kept decreasing, and it looked like they were evenly matched.</p>
<p>However, Feng Qiuyan’s side suffered a hidden danger. Apart from himself, all the old man’s chess pieces could be sacrificed. However, Feng Qiuyan had four chess pieces that could not be sacrificed. In late game, it would spell a greater disadvantage.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan wasn’t anxious at all. Seeing the number of chess pieces decreasing, he remained as calm as still water. He constantly communicated with Zhou Wen and directed the remaining Companion Beasts to fight.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen took in the orders to move the Companion Beasts, he had gained a deeper understanding of the rules of Chinese chess and knew Feng Qiuyan’s disadvantage.</p>
<p>Soon, most of the Companion Beasts on both sides were sacrificed. Apart from the four of them, there was only one Chi that represented Horse.</p>
<p>As for the old man, other than his General piece, he also had a Horse, a Cannon, and two Chariots.</p>
<p>In terms of lineup, Feng Qiuyan was clearly at a disadvantage. Furthermore, other than the Chi, they couldn’t make any sacrifices.</p>
<p>The elder said sinisterly, “It looks like you need to decide which one to sacrifice next.”</p>
<p>Apart from the elder, the Horse, Cannon, and two Chariots attacked Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>The two Chariots were the most powerful. As long as one stood in a straight line with them, they would be instantly killed. The Horse and Cannon were equally shocking.</p>
<p>If one stood in a straight line with the Horse in front of the Cannon, they would be hit by the Cannon. If one took a diagonal path, they might be killed by the Horse.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Wen, he was in a somewhat miserable state. Although Li Xuan represented Advisor—meaning he could walk diagonally—he could only walk one unit of distance each time. No matter how fast Li Xuan was, he couldn’t speed up due to the restrictions of the dimensional zone. His damage range was much shorter than Horse.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was a Soldier—a pawn—who could only take one step at a time. Furthermore, he could only advance and not retreat. At most, he could move horizontally. He was almost no threat to the elder.</p>
<p>Only Feng Qiuyan’s Chariot posed a greater threat to his opponent. However, because he couldn’t take the initiative to stand in a straight line with his opponent, he hadn’t found an opportunity.</p>
<p>Soon, the Chi that represented the Horse was killed. The four of them could no longer continue making any sacrifices.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, your skill in chess is only so-so. How disappointing.” The elder held the absolute advantage and wasn’t in a rush to continue attacking.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan’s expression remained unchanged as he looked at the elder and said, “My chess skill is inferior to yours. If this was a real game, I would definitely lose. However, this isn’t a real chess game, so I will definitely win.”</p>
<p>“Everything in the world can be distilled as chess. This is a true chess game,” the elder said.</p>
<p>“Everything is chess, but chess pieces are different,” Feng Qiuyan said.</p>
<p>“It’s no different. No matter how powerful a creature is, it’s just a chess piece in this game. It can be killed easily,” said the elder.</p>
<p>“That might not be the case. Sometimes, a chess piece can influence the chessboard.” Feng Qiuyan turned around and said to Zhou Wen and Li Xuan, “Coach, President, this is all I can do. I can only weaken my opponent to such an extent. All of you are already very clear about the rules. What’s next is the battle, not the game. You are all experts in combat, so there’s no need for me to command you.”</p>
<p>With that said, Feng Qiuyan drew his saber and charged forward. Zhou Wen and Li Xuan didn’t say a word as they followed Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>Previously, Zhou Wen hadn’t known the rules, but now, he knew them like the back of his hand. Furthermore, Feng Qiuyan had eliminated most of the chess pieces, simplifying the complicated chess game and minimizing the possibility of being accidentally killed.</p>
<p>Just as Feng Qiuyan had said, they only needed to fight under the restrictions of the rules. They didn’t need to think about how to play chess.</p>
<p>Apart from their movements being restricted and having to be careful not to be instantly killed, it was no different from normal battles.</p>
<p>The three of them moved together. Feng Qiuyan was very fast, but Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were very slow. They could only take one step at a time.</p>
<p>One Horse, one Cannon, and two Chariots attacked the two of them, but the two of them made use of their positioning and judgment to avoid being killed.</p>
<p>Instead, Feng Qiuyan used the opportunity to quickly kill a Horse.</p>
<p>The remaining two Chariots and one Cannon could only move in straight lines. The threat was immediately reduced.</p>
<p>Hence, the three of them ignored the chess pieces and charged towards the elder.</p>
<p>Just as Feng Qiuyan had said, if it was a real game, he would have lost. However, this wasn’t a real game.</p>
<p>In a real game, it was impossible for Ya’er and Li Xuan’s chess pieces to cross the river. Even their movement range was limited, but it was different in reality.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen and company coordinate with each other and how the remaining three chess pieces failed to kill any one of them, the elder’s expression turned nasty.</p>
<p>“Unforgivable… Unforgivable… That’s not how chess is played…” Anger appeared on the elder’s face.</p>
<p>“You no longer have a chance of winning. It’s best you admit defeat and let us pass,” Feng Qiuyan said. The other party was a human, so he wasn’t willing to really kill the elder.</p>
<p>“Lose? It’s impossible for me to lose. No one can defeat me on the chessboard. No one…” As the elder spoke, he stood up and let out a long roar.</p>
<p>Many dimensional creatures rushed out and replenished the dead pieces. As for Zhou Wen and company, they immediately fell into a hopeless situation as they fell into the attack range of many pieces.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, you are cheating!” Li Xuan shouted.</p>
<p>“So what? As long as I win, all of you can die. I’m number one in chess. No one can defeat me in chess,” the elder shouted with a ferocious expression.</p>
<h3 id='chapter950'>Chapter 950: Chess Soul</h3>
<p>The four of them were deep into the enemy’s formation, and there was no room for them to dodge. All the straight routes were locked. Even if they could kill a few chess pieces, the other chess pieces would kill them instantly.</p>
<p>“You cheated when you lost. You call this being number one in chess?” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“The world is like chess. The victor is king. As long as you can win, you are number one in the world.” The elder was already confident of victory, so he didn’t immediately take action.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the elder and asked, “How can a human like you control dimensional creatures in a dimensional zone?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t worried about his safety. He was only curious how the elder had done it.</p>
<p>“I’m the Chess King. This is a chess dimensional zone. The heavens have chosen me to be the king here, allowing me to revitalize the way of chess,” the elder said fervently.</p>
<p>“What a joke. Is this how you revitalize chess? You rely on cheating to defeat others, yet you still call yourself the Chess King. What a joke,” Li Xuan mocked.</p>
<p>“Ignorant people like you know nothing about chess. A win is a win. Die.” As the elder spoke, he ordered his chess pieces to attack.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen activated the Heaven-Opening Scripture and broke through the dimensional zone’s taboo. Instantly, he summoned tens of thousands of Musical Note Sprites.</p>
<p>Bam! Bam!</p>
<p>The elder’s fifteen pieces killed a few Musical Note Sprites, but the endless number of Musical Note Sprites had already occupied the entire space. They blotted out the sky and enveloped the entire chessboard.</p>
<p>“No… Impossible… How can you summon so many chess pieces… There are only sixteen chess pieces on one side of the chessboard…” The elder was horrified. Every Musical Note Sprite that filled the sky was a chess piece. Even someone who didn’t know how to play chess could instantly kill him.</p>
<p>“The rules here are useless to me,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You are cheating…” the elder shouted with a ferocious expression.</p>
<p>Li Xuan burst out laughing. “Weren’t you the one saying that cheating doesn’t matter. Who was the one who said that the victor is king?”</p>
<p>“Tell me, why can you control the dimensional creatures here?” Zhou Wen stared at the elder and asked.</p>
<p>The elder didn’t answer. He suddenly roared and ordered his chess pieces to attack again, but it was useless against Zhou Wen’s sea of Musical Note Sprites.</p>
<p>With a thought, all the elder’s chess pieces were instantly killed. As for the elder, he charged at a Musical Note Sprite, but Zhou Wen didn’t give him a chance to die. He controlled the Musical Note Sprite to spare his life.</p>
<p>“There’s something wrong with this elder.” Li Xuan also realized the problem.</p>
<p>“He should be controlled by a dimensional creature.” Zhou Wen couldn’t tell anything with his naked eye as he retracted his Companion Beasts. Then, he switched to the Hell King Life Soul and sized up the elder again.</p>
<p>This time, he finally saw the problem. There was a soul-shaped dimensional creature on the elder’s body. It looked like an ancient chess player.</p>
<p>“I’m number one in chess… I’m the Chess King…” The elder shouted crazily as he charged at Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>“What should we do?” Feng Qiuyan looked at Zhou Wen in a dilemma. He had no problem killing the enemy, but there was clearly something wrong with the elder. He wasn’t willing to kill him.</p>
<p>“Let me do it.” Zhou Wen walked towards the elder. When the elder rushed in front of him, he waved his hand and slashed out Supreme Hell King’s sinflames, burning the soul attached to the elder to ashes.</p>
<p>With the soul gone, the elder immediately collapsed to the ground like a deflated balloon. The madness in his eyes quickly faded.</p>
<p>With the soul-shaped dimensional creature dead, Zhou Wen and company felt their surroundings return to normal. There were no taboo powers to restrict their movements. They could walk horizontally and diagonally as they wished.</p>
<p>“I’m… I’m sorry… I… I didn’t do it on purpose… I…” The elder regained his consciousness and said helplessly. He looked like an honest old man. He was no longer as crazy as before.</p>
<p>“We know it’s not your fault. You were controlled by a dimensional creature. Tell us, what happened here?” Zhou Wen pulled the elder up and asked.</p>
<p>The elder heaved a sigh of relief when he heard Zhou Wen. Then, he recounted the situation.</p>
<p>This place wasn’t very famous. In the past, there was a small village on the mountain. The elder was a villager. The village lacked water and electricity, so there wasn’t much entertainment. Therefore, chess became the hobby and entertainment of many villagers.</p>
<p>Later, after the dimensional storms, many villagers were afraid that dimensional zones would appear here. Therefore, they moved to large cities.</p>
<p>The elder’s grandfather was a nostalgic person who didn’t wish to leave his hometown. Furthermore, there weren’t any dimensional zones nearby back then. Therefore, their family lived a peaceful life in the remote mountain village.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a big deal in the beginning. As there weren’t any dimensional creatures appearing, they lived rather comfortably. However, after more than ten years, after the elder’s grandfather died, the surroundings gradually began to change. The elder’s father was prepared to take him to a large city, but he realized that they couldn’t leave. This was because a dimensional creature called Chess Soul had appeared nearby.</p>
<p>If he wanted to leave this place, he had to play chess with Chess Soul. If he won, he could pass. If he lost, he would be possessed by the Chess Soul and become an elder.</p>
<p>After the elder’s father lost to the Chess Soul, he was controlled by it. His mother didn’t dare take him out again. Therefore, the mother and son lived in the small mountain village. Apart from being unable to leave, there were no other problems.</p>
<p>Later on, the elder’s mother passed away. The elder slowly aged. He had been practicing chess all these years, hoping that he could one day rush out.</p>
<p>As he had never had the courage, he only plucked up the courage to play chess with the Chess Soul when he was about to die of old age. The outcome was the same. He had lost to the Chess Soul and ended up in this state.</p>
<p>“In that case, there’s more than one Chess Soul?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“In the beginning, there were only a few Chess Souls that sealed the nearby paths. Later, more and more Chess Souls appeared, and the range of control increased,” said the elder.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, there are still many Chess Souls ahead. Should we continue forward?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the map and said, “Let’s continue. I’ll lead the way. It shouldn’t be a problem.”</p>
<p>Although he could choose other routes, Zhou Wen had already taken them. That didn’t bring any benefits to the Glimmer Life Soul, so he decided to continue taking this path.</p>
<p>When the elder heard that they wanted to continue walking forward, he pleaded to take him along. If he could meet his father, he begged them to save him.</p>
<p>Since it was just a matter of convenience, Zhou Wen agreed to take him along.</p>
<p>As they walked forward, they realized that there were indeed many criss-crossing rivers. They were like lines on a chessboard. When they walked to a river in front of them, they realized that a creature had appeared opposite them. However, this time, it wasn’t a human, but an ancient chess player in a Spirit Body state.</p>
<h3 id='chapter951'>Chapter 951: Chess Sage Li</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>This Chess Soul looked much more elegant than the one attached to the elder. Furthermore, the Essence Energy fluctuations on its body were stronger.</p>
<p>He sat by the river bank with a stone chessboard and Chinese chess in front of him. When he saw Zhou Wen and company walk over, the Chess Soul said faintly, “If you want to go up Mt. Chinese Chess, you have to pass me first.”</p>
<p>“We aren’t going up Mt. Chinese Chess. We are just passing by,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“If you wish to go up Mt. Chinese Chess, you have to pass through me first.” The Chess Soul repeated this sentence mechanically as though it was the only thing he could say. It was like an extremely unintelligent robot.</p>
<p>“Grandpa Chen, what’s Mt. Chinese Chess?” Zhou Wen asked the elder beside him.</p>
<p>“I’ve never been to Mt. Chinese Chess. I only heard from the elder when I was young that there was a Mt. Chinese Chess in the nearby mountains. Legend has it that there was an ancient general who once fought an immortal by the river. In the end, the immortal was defeated by the general and flew away in embarrassment. The immortal even abandoned his chessboard and chess pieces. Therefore, the chessboard and chess pieces turned into Mt. Chinese Chess,” the elder said after some thought.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, it’s because Mt. Chinese Chess has become a dimensional zone that the surrounding area has changed. These Chess Souls are only protecting Mt. Chinese Chess,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>Li Xuan narrowed his eyes and said, “They are guarding this place and not letting people go to Mt. Chinese Chess. Doesn’t that mean that there are treasures there?”</p>
<p>“Even if there are treasures, it has nothing to do with us. With our chess skills, I’m afraid we won’t be able to go up the mountain.” Zhou Wen didn’t know how to play chess, so he wasn’t interested in anything on Mt. Chinese Chess.</p>
<p>“All treasures in the world belong to those who are fated. Since we’ve encountered it today, if we don’t take it, we might be struck by lightning.” Li Xuan was very interested.</p>
<p>“Even so, you have to have the ability to win the game. Don’t tell me you plan on letting me fight my way up? If there’s a Mythical Chess Soul, my ability might not be effective.” Zhou Wen was telling the truth. Supreme Hell King had Epic strength after all. Who knew if it would be effective against a Mythical Chess Soul.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mt. Chinese Chess was odd. Perhaps there would be some special taboos. When the time came, Zhou Wen wouldn’t be able to use two things at the same time. He couldn’t use sinflames when dismissing the taboo, nor could he dismiss the taboo when using sinflames. That would be troublesome.</p>
<p>“There’s no need for you to fight. Watch me. Let these Chess Souls know how powerful I am.” The workings of Li Xuan’s mind was a mystery as he confidently walked towards the opposite bank.</p>
<p>After Li Xuan crossed the river, he saw the space on the other side immediately turn odd. It was as though an ancient power had descended and enveloped the space on the other side.</p>
<p>Li Xuan calmly sat opposite the Chess Soul and really began playing with it.</p>
<p>“Is President very good at chess?” Feng Qiuyan asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen him play before,” Zhou Wen said as he spread out his hands.</p>
<p>Li Xuan sat opposite the Chess Soul casually as though he thought nothing of it. As he played chess with the Chess Soul, he played with his phone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at his phone screen and immediately knew why Li Xuan was so confident. This fellow had actually used his phone to play a game of man versus machine at the Grandmaster level.</p>
<p>He played the Chess Soul’s move against the Grandmaster-level AI on the phone. Then, he used the Grandmaster-level AI’s moves against the Chess Soul.</p>
<p>The facts proved that even a dimensional creature like a Chess Soul wasn’t as smart as a computer. Li Xuan actually defeated the Chess Soul.</p>
<p>After a while, the Chess Soul was out of moves and fell into a deadlock.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The Chess Soul’s body exploded and a dimensional crystal dropped. Unfortunately, it was only a stat crystal.</p>
<p>“President, your chess skills are amazing. If I had known, I would have gotten President to do it. Coach didn’t need to sacrifice so many of his Companion Beasts.” Feng Qiuyan couldn’t see what was on Li Xuan’s phone screen from such a distance, so he thought that Li Xuan’s chess skills were extremely impressive.</p>
<p>Li Xuan held the stat crystal and walked back. He said smugly, “How about it? Do you now know that the title Chess Sage Li isn’t called for nothing?”</p>
<p>“President, you are really talented,” Feng Qiuyan praised.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, are you convinced?” Li Xuan asked Zhou Wen again.</p>
<p>“I think it’s more appropriate to call him Grandmaster Li,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Li Xuan laughed. “Indeed, I can’t hide it from you. However, can’t you pretend not to know and let me be smug for a while?”</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Feng Qiuyan asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Li Xuan showed the phone to Feng Qiuyan, who immediately understood. However, he still praised, “President, you are really smart. You actually thought of this move.”</p>
<p>“Of course. Back when I was born, a fortune-teller said that I had a halo above my head…” Li Xuan was even more smug.</p>
<p>The few of them continued on their way. Every time they encountered a Chess Soul, Li Xuan would use his phone to fight it. Every time, he would defeat the Chess Souls and even have several dimensional crystals drop.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used his phone to look at the stats of the dimensional crystals and roughly knew that they were at the Legendary or Epic stage. They weren’t that strong.</p>
<p>However, as long as they entered the Chess Soul’s range, the Chinese Chess dimensional zone would activate. Unless one defeated them in chess, there was no way to kill them.</p>
<p>Only someone like Zhou Wen who had special attribute abilities could kill the Chess Soul in an aberrant situation.</p>
<p>Li Xuan won consecutively as the few of them slowly passed through the mountainous area. However, along the way, they didn’t see the elder’s father. The Chess Souls they encountered didn’t possess anyone.</p>
<p>Even when they arrived at the mountain village the elder mentioned, they didn’t encounter his father.</p>
<p>“Grandpa Chen, from the looks of it, your father is probably no longer around. What are your plans? We can take you to a nearby city,” Li Xuan asked the elder as they rested in the village.</p>
<p>“I’m already at this age. There’s no point in going out. It’s best I stay in this mountain village,” the elder said after some thought.</p>
<p>“By the way, Grandpa Chen, where’s the Mt. Chinese Chess you mentioned?” Li Xuan asked again.</p>
<p>“It’s over there. Follow this mountain path and you’ll see it. Mt. Chinese Chess is very special. You’ll recognize it at a glance.” The elder pointed the way.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen and company bade the elder farewell, they continued on their way. Along the way, they encountered a few Chess Souls, but none of them were a match for the computer. They were defeated by Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Is that Mt. Chinese Chess?” Li Xuan pointed ahead.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Feng Qiuyan looked over and saw a strange mountain in front of them. Just as the elder had said, it was squarish and resembled a chessboard.</p>
<p>What was even stranger was that there were sounds of a battle coming from the mountain. It was as though an army was fighting an intense battle on Mt. Chinese Chess.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to observe the top of Mt. Chinese Chess, but he didn’t discover any troops. There was only a black-robed Chess Soul sitting in front of the chessboard.</p>
<p>And above the chessboard was a strange cocoon.</p>
<h3 id='chapter952'>Chapter 952: Black-Robed Chess Soul</h3>
<p>There’s actually a Guardian cocoon here? Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>Although there were many Guardian cocoons scattered across the world, the chances of encountering one weren’t high. It was considered lucky that they could encounter one in such an unknown dimensional zone.</p>
<p>“There’s a Chess Soul and a Guardian cocoon on the mountain.” Zhou Wen told Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan the situation.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s interest was piqued when he heard that. “I really get what I want. I was just thinking of getting a Guardian to play with, but he came knocking on my door. If you aren’t interested, I’ll contract him for fun.”</p>
<p>“You have to think it through. Ignoring the possibility of being contracted, even if it can be contracted, such a contract doesn’t provide any guarantees. The Guardian might betray you at any time.” Zhou Wen explained matters pertaining to Guardians to Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Li Xuan thought nothing of it. “That’s good. No one has any restrictions. It’s just like finding a girlfriend. If we are suitable, we can be together. If we aren’t suitable, we can break up. You can’t just let the other person be with you forever regardless of whether you like them or not. That’s immoral.”</p>
<p>“Alright, as long as you are fine with it.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said, “However, you have to be careful. The one on the mountain is probably a Mythical Chess Soul. It’s still a question if your strategy will work.”</p>
<p>Li Xuan thought for a moment and said, “In fact, Chinese chess is a relatively simple game. It’s not as complicated as Go. Even a Grandmaster-level human at Chinese chess won’t find it easy to beat a computer at Chinese chess. If that Chess Soul follows the rules, there’s a high chance of me winning. I’m just afraid that he has some special means that can change the game.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said, “How about this? Don’t go up. I’ll help you play chess. You will contract the Guardian yourself. If anything happens, I can handle it myself.”</p>
<p>“Haha, I won’t stand on ceremony then.” Li Xuan handed his phone to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>As there was no Internet here, he could only get Zhou Wen to use his phone which had the Chinese chess game installed and tell him how to operate it.</p>
<p>“Ya’er, it’s too dangerous up there. Wait for me here.” Zhou Wen put Ya’er down and got her to stay at the foot of the mountain while he took Li Xuan’s phone and went up Mt. Chinese Chess.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already made up his mind. If Li Xuan couldn’t contract it, he would attempt to kill the Guardian inside the cocoon. It could be considered as eliminating a future enemy.</p>
<p>The moment he took his first step on Mt. Chinese Chess, Zhou Wen felt the taboo power descend on him. Thankfully, the Heaven-Opening Scripture was effective. The restrictions were useless against him.</p>
<p>Knowing that the Heaven-Opening Scripture was useful, Zhou Wen felt relieved.</p>
<p>The black-robed Chess Soul sat in front of the chessboard. His appearance was no different from a real person. It was almost impossible to tell that he was a Spirit Body.</p>
<p>The chessboard here was much more exquisite. Not only was it engraved on the stone platform, but there were also stone blocks on both sides. After Zhou Wen sat down on the stone block opposite him, the black-robed Chess Soul finally opened his eyes. He looked at him with eyes that resembled dark abysses and said, “Are you prepared to bet on your fate as a chess player?”</p>
<p>“I’m ready.” Zhou Wen picked up Li Xuan’s phone and launched the Chinese chess app. He chose the highest difficulty level—Special Grandmaster.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was the first to move, he relaunched the game a few times. After he managed to get a round in which the computer made the first move, he followed the computer’s choice and chose to carry out a common opening—moving the Cannon.</p>
<p>The black-robed Chess Soul moved the Horse out without any change in expression.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen played chess with the black-robed Chess Soul according to the computer’s moves. The intensity exceeded his imagination as no winner could be determined.</p>
<p>Li Xuan also turned nervous when he saw this. Mythical Chess Souls are indeed extraordinary to be able to fight a Grandmaster without being at a disadvantage for so long. Will Zhou Wen be alright?</p>
<p>“Coach can resist dimensional zone rules. Even if he loses, he will be fine,” Feng Qiuyan said.</p>
<p>“That’s true, but what if…” Li Xuan felt uneasy.</p>
<p>In the end, neither side had the ability to kill the General. Unless one side made a fatal mistake, there was no chance of winning.</p>
<p>“Do you agree to a draw for this match?” the black-robed Chess Soul asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen could tell that the computer was repeating the previous steps. There was no way to win.</p>
<p>“Restart,” the black-robed Chess Soul said before the chess pieces on the chessboard automatically returned to their starting positions.</p>
<p>“Since it’s a draw, I don’t plan on continuing.” Zhou Wen got up to leave, but he realized that he couldn’t leave the stone block.</p>
<p>“Since the game has already begun, we have to determine the victor,” said the black-robed Chess Soul.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as he continued playing chess with the black-robed Chess Soul. However, the few subsequent rounds had neither side defeating the other’s General. All he could do was play again and again.</p>
<p>“The situation isn’t looking good. That black-robed Chess Soul is a little powerful. It can actually play so many rounds with a Grandmaster-level computer. Do you think the computer will screw up?” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“The computer isn’t a human brain. It won’t make mistakes.” Feng Qiuyan also became nervous.</p>
<p>Although the computer’s standard was relatively stable and probably wouldn’t make any mistakes, the black-robed Chess Soul was actually able to keep drawing with the computer. It would be difficult to tell if something unexpected would happen.</p>
<p>“The treasure in your hand is rather interesting. It can actually calculate the various possibilities of each move and choose the optimal solution,” the black-robed Chess Soul suddenly said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed. The black soul Chess Soul’s intelligence was clearly much higher than the average Chess Soul. It could actually see through the problem with the mobile game.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat worried if the black-robed Chess Soul would use any means to prevent his phone from functioning normally.</p>
<p>However, the black-robed Chess Soul didn’t have such plans. He looked at Zhou Wen and said indifferently, “It’s indeed very easy to win that way, but it’s not a sure win. I’ll win this round.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat. In fact, it wasn’t that the computer wouldn’t lose. Furthermore, this was only a mobile game. The algorithm and calculation abilities weren’t especially strong.</p>
<p>The black-robed Chess Soul began another round, but this time, Zhou Wen could clearly sense that the aura on the black-robed Chess Soul was different. The intense confidence and determination to win were just too shocking.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued playing according to the computer’s moves, but even a chess rookie like Zhou Wen could sense that the situation was developing in a disadvantageous direction.</p>
<p>“Not good. This round isn’t good.” Feng Qiuyan, who had the best chess skills among the three of them, had already noticed that something was amiss.</p>
<p>“Prepare to help Old Zhou.” Li Xuan summoned his carapace and was prepared to fight.</p>
<p>Indeed, the subsequent situation became more and more disadvantageous for Zhou Wen. Finally, Zhou Wen’s General had nowhere to go. The word “victory” appeared in the mobile game. He had followed the black-robed Chess Soul’s moves and had actually won against the computer’s Special Grandmaster.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen switched to the Heaven-Opening Scripture and prepared to fight the black-robed Chess Soul.</p>
<p>The black-robed Chess Soul looked up and stared at Zhou Wen with a strange smile. “You want to contract the Guardian, right?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter953'>Chapter 953: Don’t Belong Here</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the black-robed Chess Soul in puzzlement. He had won the game, but he didn’t immediately use the rules to control his body. He even asked such a question, so Zhou Wen was unsure what he was up to.</p>
<p>“I have a companion who wants to contract the Guardian.” Zhou Wen didn’t say that he was the one wanting to contract the Guardian.</p>
<p>If the black-robed Chess Soul allowed him to contract the Guardian for some quirky reason, wouldn’t it be awkward? Was he to attack or not?</p>
<p>One wouldn’t rush over and kill the person who had just given you a treasure with a smile, right?</p>
<p>“It’s that one, right?” The black-robed Chess Soul glanced at Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>The black-robed Chess Soul said, “I can give him a chance to attempt the contract, but there’s a condition.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the black-robed Chess Soul in shock. This was the first time he knew that the Guardian Beast could negotiate with others.</p>
<p>This intelligence should be considered above par among the dimensional creatures on Earth, right? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and asked, “What’s the condition?”</p>
<p>The black-robed Chess Soul pondered for a moment before saying, “If you can’t contract it, you have to help me destroy the Guardian in the cocoon.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was even more alarmed when he heard that. He never expected the black-robed Chess Soul to make such a request ahead of time.</p>
<p>“Pardon me for asking, but aren’t you protecting it?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>The black-robed Chess Soul didn’t answer. It only asked Zhou Wen, “You can consider it. If you agree, you can get your companion to try the contract. If you don’t agree, you can leave now.”</p>
<p>“Why did you choose us?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“Because you can help, especially you,” the black-robed Chess Soul answered directly without hiding anything.</p>
<p>“I need to discuss it with my companions,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“Sure.” The black-robed Chess Soul nodded slightly. Zhou Wen felt the taboo power on him vanish. He could stand up from the stone block.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen return, Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan wore looks of curiosity. Li Xuan asked, “Old Zhou, what’s going on?”</p>
<p>“The black-robed Chess Soul said that he can let us attempt to contract the Guardian, but there’s a condition,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“We can even negotiate?” Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan widened their eyes in disbelief.</p>
<p>“I originally thought that it wasn’t possible, but from the looks of it, I seemed to have had some misunderstandings in the past.” Zhou Wen now felt that the relationship between the Guardian Beast and the Guardian wasn’t as simple as he had imagined.</p>
<p>“Coach, what are the black-robed Chess Soul’s conditions?” Feng Qiuyan asked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen repeated the words of the black-robed Chess Soul.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan looked at each other after hearing that. Like Zhou Wen, they found it unbelievable that such a thing would happen. It had completely exceeded their imagination.</p>
<p>“If the contracting fails, do we have the ability to kill the Guardian?” Li Xuan asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“We can give it a try. Since the black-robed Chess Soul dares to take action, I believe he has some confidence. If you want to give it a try, go ahead.” Zhou Wen also wanted to eliminate the Guardian to prevent another enemy in the future.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll give it a try.” Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, Li Xuan no longer hesitated.</p>
<p>After the three of them reached a consensus, they went up Mt. Chinese Chess and arrived in front of the black-robed Chess Soul.</p>
<p>“So as long as we agree to help you, we can attempt contracting the Guardian?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“That’s right.” The black-robed Chess Soul nodded slightly.</p>
<p>“Alright, we agree. Can I attempt to contract the Guardian now?” Li Xuan looked at the black-robed Chess Soul.</p>
<p>“Anytime.” The black-robed Chess Soul looked very easygoing. It didn’t request Zhou Wen and company to make an oath.</p>
<p>In fact, not all dimensional creatures had the ability to bind people with oaths. It was a very high-level ability that only a few powerful dimensional creatures had.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll be going.” As Li Xuan walked towards the Guardian cocoon, he looked at the black-robed Chess Soul.</p>
<p>The black-robed Chess Soul sat there leisurely without any intention of stopping him.</p>
<p>Li Xuan had long understood the method of contracting a Guardian from Zhou Wen. Without any hesitation, he cut his finger and dripped a drop of blood on the Guardian cocoon.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this Guardian wasn’t interested in Li Xuan. Li Xuan’s blood flowed down without seeping into it.</p>
<p>“You don’t know what’s good for you.” Li Xuan retreated gloomily.</p>
<p>“Both of you can give it a try as well,” the black-robed Chess Soul said to Zhou Wen and Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>“There’s no need for me,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I don’t need to either,” Feng Qiuyan said firmly.</p>
<p>The black-robed Chess Soul was somewhat surprised. It glanced at them and said, “Since you can’t contract it, you should fulfill your promise now.”</p>
<p>“What do you plan on doing? What can we help with?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>The black-robed Chess Soul got up and looked at the Guardian cocoon. He said with a heavy expression, “This Guardian cocoon shouldn’t be here.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was enlightened. “In that case, you don’t need to protect it?”</p>
<p>To his surprise, the black-robed Chess Soul shook its head and said, “My duty is indeed to protect it. Therefore, before it’s contracted, I can’t injure it unless something special happens.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen guessed the special situation the black-robed Chess Soul mentioned. He looked at the Guardian cocoon and said, “Let it break out of the cocoon without a contract?”</p>
<p>The black-robed Chess Soul nodded and said, “Guardians without a contract are not allowed to break out of the cocoon. As long as you can help me break its cocoon and force it out, I can deal with it.”</p>
<p>“In other words, we only need to break the cocoon of the Guardian and don’t need to participate in the battle, right?” Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>“Of course, if you wish to participate, you can,” said the black-robed Chess Soul.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company looked at each other. They never expected the black-robed Chess Soul’s request to be so simple.</p>
<p>“What did you mean by it shouldn’t be here?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>The black-robed Chess Soul said with a strange expression, “This explanation is very complicated. To put it simply, this Guardian and I don’t belong to this dimensional zone. We appeared here due to some accident.”</p>
<p>“In that case, you aren’t a Chess Soul?” Zhou Wen and company looked at the black-robed Chess Soul in a daze.</p>
<p>“No,” the black-robed Chess Soul answered firmly.</p>
<p>This answer made Zhou Wen and company’s expressions turn even odder. Li Xuan asked, “You aren’t a Chinese chess soul? How do you have such good skills at Chinese chess?”</p>
<p>“All chess souls have similarities. Although I’m not a Chinese chess soul, I’m a type of chess soul. Therefore, learning Chinese chess isn’t difficult,” said the black-robed Chess Soul.</p>
<h3 id='chapter954'>Chapter 954: Strange Chess Game</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Li Xuan asked curiously, “What kind of chess do you play?”</p>
<p>The black-robed Chess Soul smiled without answering. “You humans are just too curious. Now isn’t the time to explain this. You should fulfill your promise.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said, “Take Ya’er down the mountain first. If it’s just destroying the Guardian cocoon. I alone am enough.”</p>
<p>Before Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan could say a word, the black-robed Chess Soul said, “It’s useless. Once the Guardian breaks out of the cocoon, the surrounding area will be under its control. Let alone the foot of the mountain, even if you walk another fifty kilometers, he will still be able to cover the area with his ability.”</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t care. He got Li Xuan and company to descend the mountain while he stood in front of the cocoon alone.</p>
<p>As he didn’t know what abilities the Guardian inside had, Zhou Wen didn’t forcefully tear open the cocoon. He summoned Explosive Fiend Man and made it use Time Bomb on the cocoon.</p>
<p>“When I’m far away, I’ll blast open the Guardian cocoon. It’s best you stay away,” Zhou Wen said as he descended the mountain and retreated a distance with Ya’er and company.</p>
<p>At the limit of Explosive Fiend Man’s range, Zhou Wen ordered Explosive Fiend Man to detonate the Time Bombs that covered the Guardian cocoon.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>With an earth-shattering boom, the Guardian cocoon exploded into pieces as the Guardian inside appeared.</p>
<p>Guardians were basically in human form. Although they were somewhat different from real humans, they weren’t too different. At most, they had wings or heads that resembled animals.</p>
<p>However, the Guardian that appeared looked completely different. At first glance, nothing about it resembled a human.</p>
<p>This Guardian looked like a canine or feline, but its body wasn’t made of flesh and blood. Its outer shell appeared metallic, like a kind of mechanical creature.</p>
<p>The moment this strange Guardian appeared, it immediately confronted the black-robed Chess Soul. A powerful aura erupted between the two.</p>
<p>“Is the battle about to begin?” Li Xuan said excitedly as he looked at the mountaintop.</p>
<p>“It has already begun.” Zhou Wen looked around. Ever since the Guardian appeared, a certain nomological force had covered a large area. They were already far enough from Chess Mountain, but they were still within the range of influence.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Furthermore, this nomological force was clearly different from Mt. Chinese Chess’s nomological forces.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also focused on the mountaintop. This battle might be different from ordinary battles. After all, the power possessed by the Chess Soul and Guardian was different from ordinary battle-type Guardians and dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was looking forward to the battle between them, he saw them sit down in front of a chessboard.</p>
<p>“What the hell! So it’s still a game of chess!” Li Xuan said in disappointment.</p>
<p>However, what they saw next was somewhat different from what they had imagined.</p>
<p>The chess pieces on the chessboard automatically exploded. Even the chessboard was somewhat different.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>When a chess piece landed on the board, the three of them took a look. It was still the familiar Chinese chess piece with the word ‘Horse’ written on it.</p>
<p>“Quick, dodge!” The moment the chess piece landed, Zhou Wen felt his heart palpitate. He suddenly pushed Feng Qiuyan and Li Xuan as he quickly retreated with Ya’er in his arms.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A huge hoof print appeared where they had been standing, as though some invisible terrifying creature had landed there.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen had reacted quickly enough. Otherwise, they would have been flattened.</p>
<p>“What the hell was that?” Li Xuan got up and threw out a Gu. The Gu charged at the hoof mark, but it rushed straight through it as though there was nothing there.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Another loud bang sounded. Not far from them, a hill collapsed as though something heavy had fallen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at the chessboard and saw that there was an additional chess piece on it. It was a piece played by the black-robed Chess Soul.</p>
<p>The chess piece was different from the Guardian’s chess piece. Although it was also a horse, there were no words written on it. Instead, it was a statue-like chess piece in the shape of a horse’s head.</p>
<p>“That piece should be chess from the West District, right?” Zhou Wen said with an odd expression.</p>
<p>“Probably. Although I’ve never played it before, I’ve seen others play it before. It should be from the West District. It’s completely different from the Chinese chess in the East District.” Li Xuan used insect eyes to see the chessboard on the mountain.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>As the Guardian and the black-robed Chess Soul kept placing pieces down, the surrounding space seemed to have invisible giants land, causing the ground, mountains, and rivers to constantly crack.</p>
<p>As for the Guardian, it seemed to deliberately target them. Every time it placed a piece, it would cause a disaster where they were. It made Zhou Wen and company constantly move to avoid the disasters that appeared out of nowhere.</p>
<p>“We can’t stay here. We have to get out.” Li Xuan led the way out.</p>
<p>However, disasters continued to descend. They were nearly hit several times.</p>
<p>Due to the nomological force, they would probably be instantly killed if they were struck. No matter how strong their bodies were, it was useless in front of laws.</p>
<p>“Get on.” Zhou Wen summoned the Earth Elemental Beast and got Li Xuan and company to sit on it before letting it leave by burrowing through the earth.</p>
<p>However, when the Earth Elemental Beast reached about fifty kilometers, it couldn’t escape. No matter how it tried to escape, it kept circling around the edge.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used the Heaven-Opening Scripture and attempted to take a step out. He did exit himself, but Ya’er was isolated inside. He couldn’t take her out.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, everything within a fifty-kilometer radius has become a chessboard that corresponds to the game. Wherever the chess piece lands, it will form a connection with the corresponding location, causing terrifying destructive power,” Feng Qiuyan said.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Another chess piece landed where they were standing. Thankfully, Zhou Wen had already seen the spot where the chess piece landed. He determined the corresponding spot in reality and dodged it with them.</p>
<p>I have to deal with that Guardian. Zhou Wen handed Ya’er to Li Xuan and rode the Earth Elemental Beast to the side, heading straight for Mt. Chinese Chess.</p>
<p>He didn’t care about the rules. He wanted to kill the Guardian.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Guardian’s target was Zhou Wen. The moment Zhou Wen appeared, its chess piece landed again. This time, it was a piece with the word “Cannon.” When it landed, it left a huge blast crater in the ground.</p>
<p>With the protection of the Heaven-Opening Scripture, Zhou Wen ignored the laws and pulled out Light Concealment Sword. With a Sky Slash, he slashed at the canine robot-like Guardian, hoping to kill it and end the terrifying game.</p>
<h3 id='chapter955'>Chapter 955: Torch Dragon’s Ferocious Might</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Sky Slash could tear through space and had astonishing destructive power.</p>
<p>Just as the Sky Slash was about to hit the Guardian, the Guardian’s body automatically split open like the disassembly of mechanical components.</p>
<p>Sky Slash slashed past its body, but it failed to injure it.</p>
<p>The Light Concealment Sword in Zhou Wen’s hand crisscrossed like lightning, but the Guardian’s body kept disassembling into components. Wherever the Sky Slash slashed, it would disassemble into smaller pieces to dodge the Sky Slash’s power.</p>
<p>Furthermore, every part of its body seemed to possess intelligence. When it fought Zhou Wen, its fingers were still tapping down on the chessboard.</p>
<p>Every time it tapped his finger, a new piece would appear on the chessboard.</p>
<p>However, the position where the chess piece landed wasn’t where Zhou Wen was, but where Li Xuan and company were.</p>
<p>Without Zhou Wen’s ability to spy on the chessboard, they had no idea when a chess piece would land on them. They had relied on their intuition and experience to dodge a few times, but they were already in peril.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth, Explosive Fiend Man, Torch Dragon, and other Companion Beasts to attack the Guardian.</p>
<p>This move worked as expected. Under the siege of Zhou Wen’s Mythical Companion Beast line up, the Guardian, who seemed to be able to infinitely disassemble, couldn’t withstand the pressure. A portion of the disassembled parts were shattered by Tyrant Behemoth’s punch.</p>
<p>However, the shattered components actually reassembled like nanomachines. This terrifying Guardian actually managed to withstand the attack of the Mythical line up.</p>
<p>With the chess piece, Cannon, landing, Feng Qiuyan and Li Xuan had no time to dodge. Li Xuan pounced forward and held Ya’er and Feng Qiuyan in front of him. He supported himself with both hands as an evil aura on his body flickered. The power of the carapace Life Soul was pushed to its limits.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Under the terrifying strike, the carapace on Li Xuan’s back shattered. The fragments stabbed into his body, piercing through his flesh and bones. Instantly, Li Xuan was covered in blood.</p>
<p>Blood dripped down as Li Xuan continued supporting himself with both hands. A deep crater appeared in the surrounding rocks. Ya’er and Feng Qiuyan were protected by him. Ya’er wasn’t injured, while Feng Qiuyan was only slightly injured.</p>
<p>“President!” Feng Qiuyan couldn’t help but be alarmed when he saw Li Xuan’s spine exposed from the strike. Furthermore, many parts of his body had torn open.</p>
<p>“Don’t move,” Li Xuan shouted coldly, stopping Feng Qiuyan from crawling out.</p>
<p>The injuries on his body healed at an extremely fast speed and the carapace automatically healed.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>At that moment, there was another loud stomp. A terrifying force that resembled the hoof of a pegasus stepped on Li Xuan’s back. Immediately, blood spewed out of his mouth. Li Xuan, who had yet to fully recover, suffered serious injuries once again. His armor shattered and his bones were almost crushed.</p>
<p>But even so, Li Xuan didn’t die. His injuries and shattered carapace rapidly healed once more.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that Li Xuan couldn’t last long, but he had yet to find a way to kill the Guardian. All he could do was get Tyrant Behemoth to rush over to provide support.</p>
<p>The Guardian struck Li Xuan again and again, but Li Xuan managed to survive. Even so, the situation was only worsening.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Tyrant Behemoth finally rushed over and protected the three of them under its body, blocking the terrifying bombardment.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth, who had activated Absolute Strength, spat out a mouthful of blood after suffering the strike. It was immediately severely injured, and its bones fractured.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that it wasn’t because the Guardian was powerful, but because it had borrowed the power of Mt. Chinese Chess’s dimensional zone. Tyrant Behemoth wasn’t only resisting the Guardian’s power, but also the rules of Mt. Chinese Chess. This was a truly terrifying power. No matter how strong a Companion Beast was, it was difficult for it to withstand the power of an entire dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Previously, Li Xuan had been able to resist the rules thanks to his Life Providence. The rules of Mt. Chinese Chess implied destruction when struck by a chess piece, but his Life Providence was indestructible. Furthermore, Li Xuan’s Life Soul was extremely strange, allowing him to withstand the strikes of the chess pieces.</p>
<p>If it were anyone else, they might not have been able to withstand it even with a Mythical body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also attacking the Guardian with all his might, but the Guardian was as tenacious as Li Xuan. No matter how many times its body components were destroyed, they could still be combined to form new parts even if they were shattered.</p>
<p>Its entire body seemed to be made of nanomachines. Unless one could directly vaporize it or make it disappear into nothingness, it was very difficult to kill it.</p>
<p>“Die!” Zhou Wen knew that they couldn’t hold on any longer. He ordered Torch Dragon Youngling to use Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>The power of the Bright Torch Vision World immediately sucked in the Guardian’s body, but the body sucked in seemed to be only a part of its body.</p>
<p>Soon, another nanomachine appeared out of nowhere and began reconstructing the Guardian’s body.</p>
<p>“Chess Soul, think of a way to escape.” Zhou Wen roared at the black-robed Chess Soul before putting away all the Companion Beasts other than Torch Dragon. He also wore the Jade Crystal Essence Armor.</p>
<p>In the next second, Torch Dragon’s body emitted a bright glow as rows of Torch Dragon Eyes opened. Like an ancient ferocious god, it simultaneously activated Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>The black-robed Chess Soul turned pale with fright when it saw this. Its figure flashed and vanished.</p>
<p>The Guardian’s disintegrated body was rapidly sucked away by the Bright Torch Vision World. Even the Mt. Chinese Chess below suffered a terrifying energy strike as it vanished piece by piece.</p>
<p>The Guardian seemed to realize that it was about to die. Unable to withstand Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World in its World King Transformation state, the Guardian suddenly made a strange move. Its remaining components rushed towards the spot where the Guardian cocoon was.</p>
<p>However, very quickly, under the omnipresent Bright Torch Vision World, the Guardian’s body was sucked in. Even half of Mt. Chinese Chess vanished.</p>
<p>The power of the chess game finally vanished. Apart from the dimensional zone’s nomological powers, the other powers vanished.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon Youngling landed weakly and was almost unable to raise its head. Using the World King Transformation and Bright Torch Vision World at full strength expended too much of its strength. Thankfully, it had only lasted for a blink of an eye. If it had lasted any longer, Torch Dragon Youngling would have died first.</p>
<p>The black-robed Chess Soul crawled out from beneath Mt. Chinese Chess and looked at the mountaintop that had vanished.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan, are you alright?” Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to bother with the black-robed Chess Soul as he quickly arrived in front of Li Xuan and company.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth was covered in injuries and looked severely injured. It had only suffered two strikes, but Li Xuan had suffered at least five strikes.</p>
<p>“I’m fine.” Li Xuan crawled out from below as his body and carapace healed at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>
<h3 id='chapter956'>Chapter 956: Defective Guardian</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Just as Li Xuan’s carapace was being repaired, a strange scene suddenly ensued. Tiny specks of dust appeared where his carapace shattered. The specks of dust mixed into the carapace and fused with it, allowing the carapace to recover faster.</p>
<p>However, the repaired carapace was somewhat different from the other intact parts of the carapace. It suffused a strange metallic luster as though it was mixed with metallic granules.</p>
<p>“This is… That Guardian… What does it want? Don’t tell me it wants to occupy my body?” Li Xuan was given a fright.</p>
<p>“It chose to use the drop of blood from before to contract with you, allowing it to escape death,” the black-robed Chess Soul floated over and said to Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it said that a contract needs both parties to agree? Why don’t I feel anything?” Li Xuan asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“The Guardian contract naturally requires both parties to agree. However, under such circumstances, it no longer has the time to wait for your agreement. Therefore, it chose a method that doesn’t require your agreement,” said the black-robed Chess Soul.</p>
<p>“Isn’t this forcing himself on me?” Li Xuan looked at the extremely patchy carapace on his body.</p>
<p>The metallic parts looked like patches. It looked ugly.</p>
<p>The black-robed Chess Soul said with a strange expression, “Usually, both parties have the right to terminate a Guardian contract at any time. However, under the present circumstances, the Guardian has made a huge sacrifice. Unless you are willing, it’s impossible for it to terminate the contract with you. If you die, it dies. It can be said that you have absolute dominance.”</p>
<p>“It sounds pretty good, but isn’t this a little too ugly?” Li Xuan still didn’t like the appearance of the carapace.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. It will continue fusing with your carapace. In the future, when your carapace is shattered and reconstructed, everything will become uniform. Perhaps you can wait a little while longer. It’s still injured and has little remaining strength. It won’t be able to fuse completely. After it recovers, even if your carapace isn’t shattered, it will completely fuse with it. When that happens, it will contact you,” the black-robed Chess Soul continued.</p>
<p>“Since it has come to this, it looks like I can’t reject it. I’ll reluctantly accept it. By the way, what’s the name of this Guardian?” Li Xuan asked the black-robed Chess Soul.</p>
<p>“Alpha.” The black-robed Chess Soul said its name.</p>
<p>However, even if he didn’t say it, Alpha would directly communicate with Li Xuan after it recovered some energy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen listened from the side, unsure if he should congratulate Li Xuan for his good luck or feel sorry for him.</p>
<p>His Life Soul was problematic to begin with. Now, he had contracted a heavily injured Guardian. Furthermore, it was some unknown contract that allowed the Guardian to fuse with his problematic Life Soul. He didn’t know what would happen in the future.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your help. Alpha’s mutation has exceeded my expectations. If it weren’t for you, I’m afraid I would have been defeated,” the black-robed Chess Soul said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Why did you want to destroy it?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>The black-robed Chess Soul hesitated for a moment before saying, “As you know, the place Alpha and I should preside over should be a dimensional zone in the West District. Although the two dimensional zones are both Chinese chess dimensional zones, the rules are completely different. It was because of an accident that Alpha and I came here. This accident was caused by Alpha itself. It had a problem and lost control. It’s a defective product that can’t represent our race. In addition, after it came to Mt. Chinese Chess and absorbed the powers here, its problems worsened. It’s impossible for it to represent our race, so I can only choose to destroy it.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression turned even odder when he heard that. Not only did Li Xuan have a problematic Life Soul, but he also had a highly problematic Guardian. Who knew if anything would happen to him in the future?</p>
<p>“Please accept this. I’ll be heading to the West District. If you come to the West District in the future, you can take this to the Black and White Chess Country’s dimensional zone. I’m willing to guide you and contract my race’s new Guardian.” The black-robed Chess Soul handed something to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>It was a white chess piece that looked like a King in international chess.</p>
<p>“I’ll visit when I have the chance, but I can’t guarantee you that I’ll be contracting the Guardian.” Zhou Wen accepted the chess piece.</p>
<p>“My race’s Guardian is very compatible with your attributes. If you can fuse together, you will definitely be invincible in the present era. I hope you can consider it carefully. I’ll wait for your answer in the Black and White Chess Country.” As the black-robed Chess Soul spoke, it bowed slightly and left Mt. Chinese Chess.</p>
<p>The group continued on their way and soon left Mt Chinese Chess’s dimensional zone. Zhou Wen searched the entire way, but he unfortunately failed to find the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t take the black-robed Chess Soul’s words to heart. The black-robed Chess Soul only said what he had said because he saw how powerful his Companion Beasts were. Zhou Wen was certain that he didn’t even know what attributes he had or what Essence Energy Art he cultivated.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that Zhou Wen didn’t plan on contracting a Guardian, even if he really wanted to, he wouldn’t choose a Guardian of the Black and White Chess Country.</p>
<p>However, if there was a chance, he could head to the Black and White Chess Country to take a look. Perhaps there would be a tiny palm symbol. It would be nice to download an instance dungeon.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, they didn’t have any accidents. Occasionally, dimensional creatures would appear, but their levels weren’t high. They could be easily dealt with.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, Feng Qiuyan spoke even less along the way.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought that it was because of his nostalgia for his hometown, but Li Xuan could read a little of Feng Qiuyan’s mind. However, it wasn’t convenient for him to say anything.</p>
<p>While having a break one day, Feng Qiuyan suddenly came to Zhou Wen’s side and asked with a solemn expression, “Coach, can I ask you a question?”</p>
<p>“Just ask it directly. Why are you standing on ceremony with me?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan looked at Zhou Wen and asked, “Coach, you don’t plan on contracting a Guardian, right?”</p>
<p>“Not at the moment,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“But if you don’t contract a Guardian, a Perfect Body Life Soul is already the final destination for humanity. How do we proceed from there?” Feng Qiuyan asked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be taken aback. He didn’t immediately answer. He planned on using the Lost Immortal Sutra to advance to the Mythical stage, but Feng Qiuyan had never cultivated the Lost Immortal Sutra. It seemed impossible for him to rely on his own strength to advance to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>“Currently, humans have confirmed that there are two ways to advance to the Mythical stage. One is to fuse with a Guardian and transform oneself like my teacher, Wang Mingyuan. This way, a human’s body can break through its limits without the restrictions of being unable to advance to the Mythical stage. The other way is to contract with a Guardian and use the Guardian’s power to advance to the Mythical stage. However, this advancement is only the advancement of a Guardian. One’s body won’t become stronger.” Zhou Wen wasn’t a true coach, so he couldn’t decide which path Feng Qiuyan should take.</p>
<p>“Coach, which path are you taking? The first one?” Feng Qiuyan asked.</p>
<p>“Neither. I want to rely on my own strength to advance to the Mythical stage. However, this path is basically a dead end,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<h3 id='chapter957'>Chapter 957: Feng and Qin</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen activated his Glimmer Life Soul the entire journey. When he arrived near Sea Return, the Glimmer Life Soul had improved significantly, but it was still lacking a little when it came to advancing to the Perfect Body.</p>
<p>Every time he rested, Zhou Wen would switch to cultivating the Qi Refinement Art. He would absorb Essence Crystals in-game to raise Sword Pill’s Essence Energy.</p>
<p>As many of the Essence Energy Crystals Zhou Wen absorbed in-game were at the Mythical stage, Sword Pill’s Essence Energy increased rapidly. He could sense that Sword Pill’s Essence Energy had reached a certain limit and was about to advance again.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen still didn’t understand how Sword Pill could advance to a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>The last time he advanced to an Evolved Body, Zhou Wen had cultivated 3,000 sword intents, but it didn’t seem to be effective this time. From the looks of it, the key to advancing to a Perfect Body wasn’t the sword intents.</p>
<p>Since it’s called Sword Pill, it probably has something to do with swords. Could it be that I should transform Sword Pill into a sword? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already considered this problem previously. He didn’t have a sword he especially liked. If he needed to turn Sword Pill into a sword, Zhou Wen planned on using Light Concealment Sword as its prototype.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>However, Sword Pill failed to be molded, nor did it advance to a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>If it can’t be transformed into a sword, how can I advance Sword Pill? Zhou Wen considered all sorts of possibilities and tried many methods, but he still failed.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>When they finally arrived at Sea Return, Feng Qiuyan invited Zhou Wen and Li Xuan to stay at his place.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan didn’t stand on ceremony as they followed Feng Qiuyan to the Feng family residence. In fact, there weren’t many places in Sea Return City that they could stay. If they didn’t go there, their only choice was Sea Return City’s only hotel.</p>
<p>There were two famous Feng family branches. One was in the Imperial Capital, and the other was the Feng family of Sea Return.</p>
<p>As Sea Return was close to the sea, the break-out creatures in the nearby sea often appeared ashore, making the vicinity of Sea Return City very desolate. There were very few pedestrians on the streets.</p>
<p>When the Feng family saw Feng Qiuyan return, they were overjoyed. It looked like Feng Qiuyan was very favored by the Feng family.</p>
<p>Upon hearing that Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were Feng Qiuyan’s schoolmates, the Feng family was especially warm to them.</p>
<p>“Little Yanyan, you have quite a high status in your family. You actually have special guest rooms,” Li Xuan said as he sized up the room.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan said, “As the eldest son and grandson of the family, I have some privileges, but I’ll be responsible for the Feng family in the future.”</p>
<p>“Qiuyan, you’re back.” Just as the three of them were chatting, a beautiful and dignified woman walked over.</p>
<p>“Sis Ling, I’ve just returned. I originally planned on visiting you after settling my classmates down.” Feng Qiuyan chatted with the woman.</p>
<p>“Little Yanyan, why didn’t you introduce such a beauty to us? Is this your sister? She’s really beautiful,” Li Xuan praised the woman.</p>
<p>Li Xuan didn’t mean to curry favor, but this woman was indeed very beautiful. Even Zhou Wen took a second look.</p>
<p>“This is Qin Ling, Sis Ling. These are my schoolmates, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan. They helped me a lot in school,” Feng Qiuyan introduced the three of them.</p>
<p>Qin Ling was a very polite woman, but at the same time, she kept an arms-length distance from people despite looking very gentle. People couldn’t build a closer relationship with her.</p>
<p>After Qin Ling left, Li Xuan asked Feng Qiuyan, “Little Yanyan, she isn’t a blood sister, right?”</p>
<p>“How did you know?” Feng Qiuyan was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>“Apart from practicing martial arts, you are really an idiot in other aspects. Her surname is Qin and yours is Feng. How can she be your blood sister?” Li Xuan said with a twitch of his lips.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan explained, “Then you’re wrong. Our Feng family has a tradition. The boys have the surname Feng, but girls have the surname Qin.”</p>
<p>“Why the strange rules? Could it be that your mother’s surname is Qin? That’s not right either. It’s impossible for all the women who marry into your Feng family to have the Qin surname,” Li Xuan said in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan said, “Actually, I’m not too sure about the reason. I heard from my elders that it seems that a person with the Qin surname had done our Feng family a great favor, so to thank him, all the girls in the Feng family have the Qin surname. This tradition existed many years before the dimensional storms and it has been continued to this day.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Feng Qiuyan said in embarrassment, “However, Qin Ling isn’t my sister. She doesn’t have any blood ties with our Feng family.”</p>
<p>“Then what’s her relationship with you? There’s something amiss between the two of you,” Li Xuan asked nosily.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan blushed. “Actually, Sis Ling is my fiancée.”</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, you’re only seventeen, right? How do you have a fiancée? And she’s so beautiful! She looks much older than you. She should be in her twenties, right?” Li Xuan widened his eyes.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan explained, “Sea Return is actually more traditional. My father and Sis Ling’s parents are good friends. This marriage was arranged by our family.”</p>
<p>“What era is this? To think there are still arranged marriages… Why didn’t I encounter such a great deal? Why don’t I have such a beautiful fiancée? Heaven is unfair!” Li Xuan sighed at his fate.</p>
<p>However, Feng Qiuyan’s expression darkened. “It’s not what you think. The reason we are engaged is related to our Life Providences. It’s not an arranged marriage.”</p>
<p>“Life Providence? I remember that your Life Providence is Swift Saber Heavenly King. Could it be that her Life Providence is Swift Saber Heavenly Queen, making her a match for you? Then you are so lucky,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Stop talking. Let Qiuyan finish.” Zhou Wen could tell that there was something amiss with Feng Qiuyan’s emotions.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan said, “Her Life Providence is Scabbard, and her Life Soul is the Saber Sacrificer. However, any saber that lands in her hand will become stronger. The reason my father made her my fiancée was because he fancied her Life Providence and Life Soul, believing they would be of help to me.”</p>
<p>“Although that’s the case, Qin Ling is so beautiful. Even if she’s a little older, you can still count yourself lucky,” Li Xuan consoled.</p>
<p>“Sis Ling is indeed very nice,” Feng Qiuyan said with a sigh.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was good with reading people as he added, “But you don’t like her, right?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that I don’t like her. I should say that I’ve never thought about these things. All I want now is to become stronger,” Feng Qiuyan said.</p>
<p>“That’s an excuse. If you really liked her, you wouldn’t have such thoughts. She just hasn’t caught your eye,” Li Xuan said with a twitch of his lips.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan looked out the door and seeing that no one was there, he lowered his voice and said to Zhou Wen and Li Xuan, “I’ll tell you something, but you mustn’t tell anyone else.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. Don’t you trust our character? We definitely won’t tell anyone. Quick, tell me what’s going on. Could it be that Qin Ling has a boyfriend outside? It’s no wonder considering how she made you a cuckold. She’s already in her twenties, so it’s not too much to have already had a boyfriend,” Li Xuan said excitedly.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? Sis Ling isn’t that kind of person.” Feng Qiuyan hesitated for a moment before saying, “I think Sis Ling isn’t human.”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were taken aback as they looked at Feng Qiuyan in a daze, unsure what he meant.</p>
<h3 id='chapter958'>Chapter 958: Electric Power</h3>
<p>“No, I don’t understand. What do you mean?” Li Xuan looked at Feng Qiuyan in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan explained, “Because the two families have a good relationship. When I was young, I often tagged along behind Sis Ling. Once, I followed Sis Ling to the nearby coast to have some fun. Back then, break-out creatures seldom appeared, so the two of us played by the seaside.”</p>
<p>After some hesitation, Feng Qiuyan continued, “I vaguely remember a break-out creature rushing out of the sea and pouncing at us on the beach. It even had a particularly fishy smell. I turned groggy when I smelled it, as though I was about to faint. At that moment, I saw Sis Ling turn extremely terrifying in my spinning mind as she charged at the break-out creature. Then, I fainted.”</p>
<p>“When I woke up, I saw Sis Ling beside me, but I didn’t see any break-out creature. When I mentioned the break-out creature, Sister Ling wore a puzzled expression. She asked me if I was too tired from playing and had a nightmare after falling asleep,” Feng Qiuyan said with a strange expression. “But I don’t think it was a dream. It was just that I didn’t find any traces of the dimensional creature nearby, so I kept this matter to myself and didn’t tell anyone.”</p>
<p>“How old were you then?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“Three years old,” Feng Qiuyan said.</p>
<p>“How old was Qin Ling?” Li Xuan asked again.</p>
<p>“Thirteen,” Feng Qiuyan answered after some thought.</p>
<p>“It’s very normal for a three-year-old child to have wild thoughts. Perhaps you had really dreamed it. If Qin Ling was only thirteen years old, she wouldn’t have reached the Legendary stage, right? It’s virtually impossible for her to use a Companion Beast…” Li Xuan analyzed.</p>
<p>“That I know,” Feng Qiuyan said with a strange expression.</p>
<p>“If you are really sure that you didn’t see wrongly, then there’s something wrong with Qin Ling,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan said, “I can’t be sure if I was dreaming back then, so I hope you can help me confirm what happened.”</p>
<p>“How can we help you? We can’t drag Qin Ling over to beat her up and ask if she can transform into a monster, right? Even if we dared ask, she won’t admit it, right?” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“I also know that it won’t be easy, but I can only ask for your help,” Feng Qiuyan said.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s try our best. We can’t guarantee that we can get to the bottom of the matter,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>Despite being delighted, Feng Qiuyan said to Zhou Wen, “Coach, I hope this matter can be carried out secretly. No matter the outcome, don’t let a fourth person other than us know.”</p>
<p>“I understand.” Zhou Wen agreed.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, how do you plan on investigating this matter?” Li Xuan asked Zhou Wen after Feng Qiuyan settled the two of them in and took them to meet his elders.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Let’s wait and see. Didn’t Qiuyan say that he will arrange for us to interact with Qin Ling? We’ll think of something when the time comes,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I got a Gu from the South District. If it can be attached to a person, it can affect their will. Do you want to give it a try?” Li Xuan said with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s best we don’t. After all, we are guests. It won’t be nice if the Feng family discovers our actions,” Zhou Wen said with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>“I’m meeting Hui Haifeng. Do you want to come with me?” Zhou Wen asked Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“I don’t know him well, so there’s no point. Go yourself. I’ll take a look around,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>After the two of them separated, Zhou Wen took Ya’er to see the Hui family. The Hui family was a major family in Sea Return, so he didn’t need to ask around to quickly find their residence.</p>
<p>Before arriving, Zhou Wen gave Hui Haifeng a call. Hui Haifeng quickly came to the door to welcome him.</p>
<p>“I never expected you to come so quickly.” Hui Haifeng smiled and gave Zhou Wen a hug.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t used to such enthusiasm. “The journey was rather smooth, but the situation in Sea Return seems to have deteriorated far earlier than others.”</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng nodded. “It’s indeed terrible. This month isn’t over yet, but we’ve had two small-scale marine dimensional creatures hordes come ashore. Although there weren’t any casualties, it will be exhausting for us if this happens every month. It’s very easy for problems to arise. Furthermore, the strongest marine dimensional creatures that have come ashore are at the Epic stage, but who knows when a Mythical dimensional creature will come ashore. In short, Sea Return City is in a very thorny situation.”</p>
<p>“Have you thought of migrating inland?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“How can it be that easy to migrate? Ignoring the fact that we have family and business here in Sea Return, even if we can abandon these businesses, how can we find a city willing to share resources with us elsewhere?” Hui Haifeng led Zhou Wen into a yard. “Let’s not talk about this. I’ll show you something good.”</p>
<p>The Hui family residence was huge. In fact, it could no longer be considered a normal home. It was more like a base.</p>
<p>They arrived at a place resembling a warehouse. Hui Haifeng opened the door and pointed inside. “What do you think of this thing?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw huge machinery inside the warehouse. There were all sorts of gears and electronic devices. On the left side of the warehouse were many devices that resembled treadmills. Many Companion Beasts were running on them.</p>
<p>“Companion Beasts can be trained like this?” Zhou Wen looked at the Companion Beasts in surprise.</p>
<p>“What training? We are using Companion Beasts to generate electricity. Using the power of the Companion Beasts to drive the generator, we can store the electricity produced. Anyway, the Companion Beasts have nothing to do when not fighting. This way, we can use their strength and also give them some training,” Hui Haifeng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already heard that many places were powered by Companion Beasts, but this was the first time he had seen an example of one.</p>
<p>“Is this considered environmentally friendly?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if it’s environmentally friendly, but Companion Beasts can automatically recover their stamina without needing external replenishment of their energy. It’s indeed very convenient,” Hui Haifeng said as he continued walking into the warehouse.</p>
<p>When he reached the deepest part of the warehouse, there was a room that was separated by glass. Zhou Wen could see many high precision instruments inside. Many staff members were busy inside.</p>
<p>After Hui Haifeng and Zhou Wen changed into special work clothes, they entered the glass room. Then, Hui Haifeng pointed at something in the culture tank and said, “Look at this. This is our main area of research now.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the culture tank and saw a white blob inside. It looked like a white piece of fat, but it also looked a little like a fungus.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<h3 id='chapter959'>Chapter 959: Marine Dimensional Creatures Coming Ashore</h3>
<p>“This is an artificial dimensional creature we are researching,” Hui Haifeng answered.</p>
<p>“Artificial dimensional creatures? How do you create them?” Zhou Wen knew nothing about this.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng explained, “Dimensional creatures are somewhat different from Earth’s creatures. Earth’s creatures are basically carbon-based, but dimensional creatures are different. Although some dimensional creatures have flesh and blood, carbon isn’t the building blocks of their bodies. Research has shown that creatures on Earth are affected by the dimensional storms. Their bodies undergo some changes, causing some abnormal elements to appear in originally carbon-based matter.”</p>
<p>“Therefore, we extracted this element and attempted to culture and use it. Based on our present research, this element can rapidly mutate terran creatures. It’s even possible for them to mutate into lifeforms similar to dimensional creatures in a short period of time.” With that said, Hui Haifeng pointed at the creature in the culture tank excitedly. “This is the latest result. We used this element to successfully turn ordinary terran bacteria into a dimensional creature. Although it’s only at the most ordinary Mortal stage, this is already huge progress. In the future, we will conduct experiments on plants and animals. If everything goes well, perhaps one day, humans can become as powerful as dimensional creatures through the injection of this element.”</p>
<p>“Are there any side effects from injecting this element?” Zhou Wen asked worriedly.</p>
<p>“We haven’t discovered any side effects. Don’t worry, we will do rigorous experiments. We won’t let humans take risks easily.” Hui Haifeng continued, “Our goal is to let the human race evolve as a whole. The bodies of humans now are too weak. In the future, if humans can have powerful bodies like dimensional creatures and have a Life Providence and Life Soul at birth, we won’t have to be afraid of any invasion from dimensional creatures.”</p>
<p>“It sounds pretty good.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>“However, we are still in the early stages. There’s still a long way to go before the real human trials. I hope that day won’t come too late,” Hui Haifeng said.</p>
<p>After leaving the laboratory, the two of them chatted about their past days in college and their current situation.</p>
<p>“You are native to Sea Return. Are there any special dimensional zones you can show me?” Zhou Wen still wanted to download more dungeons.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng smiled and said, “If you want to see special dimensional zones, you’ve really come to the right place. Although there aren’t many people in Sea Return, there are quite a number of dimensional zones. They are on land and in the sea, but especially in the sea. You definitely won’t be able to see such places further inland.”</p>
<p>“What’s so special about them?” Zhou Wen was intrigued.</p>
<p>“There’s too much to tell. Sea God Reef, Undersea Blue Hole, Infinite Island, and so on are all extremely mysterious dimensional zones. Very few humans can enter them. Even the great devils overseas can only take a detour when they encounter these dimensional zones.” Hui Haifeng recounted the famous dimensional zones near Sea Return to Zhou Wen as if he knew everything.</p>
<p>“Since it’s still early, I’ll head to the nearby Sea God Reef to take a look,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I still have work to do, so I can’t accompany you. Give me a moment. I’ll find a reliable person to guide you,” Hui Haifeng said.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to go through so much trouble. Feng Qiuyan from the Feng family is a member of our Xuanwen Club. He has also returned. He can be my guide,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Look at me, almost forgetting this matter. It’s best if Feng Qiuyan goes with you.” Hui Haifeng pondered for a moment before reminding Zhou Wen, “Recently, Sea Return hasn’t been peaceful. There are many more break-out creatures coming ashore than before. I’m afraid something major will happen soon. Don’t go too deep. Just take a look at the coastal areas.”</p>
<p>After bidding Hui Haifeng farewell, Zhou Wen was just about to contact Li Xuan when he heard warning sirens in Sea Return City.</p>
<p>The ear-piercing sound echoed in the city. There weren’t many people on the streets originally, but suddenly, many people appeared, fleeing towards the underground bomb shelters.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Zhou Wen got a hold of someone and asked.</p>
<p>“Marine creatures have come ashore again. Aren’t you going to take refuge in the bomb shelter?” the man asked as he hurriedly left.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen ran towards the coast. A high wall made of steel and concrete had been built around the city’s periphery. The members of Sea Return’s major families gathered here.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen went up the high wall, he looked in the direction of the sea and was somewhat alarmed.</p>
<p>The waves in the distant sea weren’t huge, but huge crabs that resembled tanks crawled out of the sea. There were quite a number of them. Large swarms of crabs were heading for Sea Return City. The large crabs at the front of the swarm were less than five kilometers away from the high wall.</p>
<p>Looking at the black swarm of crabs that resembled a legion of tanks, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but lick his lips. He felt his saliva secreting significantly.</p>
<p>Previously, Ouyang Lan had treated him to eat a meal of crabs. He had heard that they were very expensive, but they tasted great.</p>
<p>Back then, the crabs were about the size of a plate. The crabs here were so huge that if cooked, they would probably be more delicious than what Zhou Wen had eaten before.</p>
<p>“Which family are you from? Why aren’t you taking refuge in the bomb shelter? Why are you here?” a middle-aged man asked when he saw Zhou Wen sprawled on the tall wall and staring blankly at the huge crabs on the beach.</p>
<p>“I’m here to help defend the city,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Why are you bringing a child here to mess around? Quickly go back and hide,” the middle-aged man said as he left to help in the supply transportation.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen heard a loud bang. A cannon set up on the high wall fired. A cannonball mixed with Essence Gold exploded among the crabs. Amidst the intense blast, the cannonball fragments scattered in all directions.</p>
<p>Some of the fragments struck the crabs’ shells, but they were of limited effect. They only left some superficial wounds on the shells without leaving any fatal injuries.</p>
<p>However, a few crabs had their legs injured, causing their movements to slow down.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The salvo constantly rang out as shells exploded among the crabs. Zhou Wen could tell that the bombs weren’t used to kill the giant crabs, but to blast their legs apart. This way, the crabs could no longer charge into Sea Return City after losing their mobility.</p>
<p>However, there were too many huge crabs rushing out of the sea. The crabs in front had their legs blasted apart, but the crabs behind them crawled over them and continued charging towards Sea Return City.</p>
<p>The bombardment continued, but it didn’t put any end to the crab horde. When the crabs approached the city, the members of the few families began shooting with their guns.</p>
<p>However, their target was the crabs’ legs. They tried their best to hit the crabs’ joints and make them lose their mobility.</p>
<p>Capable Legendary and Epic experts summoned their Companion Beasts and stood guard outside the high wall. They were in charge of repelling the large crabs that came close.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked for a while and suddenly realized that there was a huge creature in the sea near the coast.</p>
<h3 id='chapter960'>Chapter 960: Deep Blue Crab Sovereign</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to observe carefully and heard a massive object moving in the sea.</p>
<p>Before he could determine what the behemoth in the sea was, he suddenly saw the seawater suddenly rise, forming a huge wave. And within that wave, a huge, castle-sized, dark-blue crab crawled out from the sea.</p>
<p>The huge crabs that looked like tanks on the beach were already huge, but in front of the dark-blue crab, they looked like baby crabs.</p>
<p>Even the twenty-meter-tall wall appeared much shorter in front of the huge crab. Its pincers were terrifyingly large.</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned seeing the giant crab come out of the sea. Even the Epic experts who were fighting the crabs had a drastic change in expression.</p>
<p>Before the giant crab’s legs could walk out of the sea, it suddenly opened its mouth and spewed out countless bubbles. The bubbles flew towards Sea Return City and filled the sky.</p>
<p>Someone shot at the bubbles that flew over. When the bullet hit a bubble, the bubble that looked light and thin didn’t burst. Instead, after the bullet entered the bubble, it immediately floated in the bubble as though it had escaped gravity.</p>
<p>Some people used sabers or ordered their Companion Beasts to charge forward and destroy the bubble, but no matter what it was, it would be sucked into the bubble the moment it touched it.</p>
<p>Then, the bubbles that had sucked in something seemed to be pulled into the sky by some force. In the blink of an eye, they flew hundreds of meters high and continued rising rapidly, as though they were about to break through the atmosphere and enter outer space.</p>
<p>When people saw this scene, they began to dodge the bubbles in horror. After all, there were very few humans who knew how to fly. Some Epic humans couldn’t fly in the air because they didn’t have flying pets.</p>
<p>If they fell from such a height, they would probably die a terrible death.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the bubbles rose rapidly. If they really entered outer space, they would definitely die.</p>
<p>Instantly, the entire defense line of Sea Return City fell into chaos. Ignoring ordinary people, even Epic experts began retreating. As for the crab legion, the effective resistance against them collapsed, allowing them to rush to the high walls of Sea Return City. They used their steel-like crab pincers to strike the high walls, splattering concrete and cracking steel alike. Before long, the high walls would be breached.</p>
<p>The air bubbles that filled the sky had already floated into the city. Seeing that Sea Return City definitely couldn’t withstand such an attack, Zhou Wen put on the Jade Crystal Spirit armor and suddenly flew into the sky, quickly arriving above the sea.</p>
<p>He held a Golden Harp in his hand as he strummed it.</p>
<p>Hum!</p>
<p>A strange sound spread out all the bubbles in the radius of the Golden Harp burst. The crabs that had either reached the shore or were still in the water were struck by the terrifying sound wave. They spewed out water and fell to the ground. About 80% of them died. Those that survived were severely injured as they struggled to get up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen deliberately used String Aural Quake above the sea at a spot relatively far from Sea Return City. Although String Aural Quake’s power still affected the city, it was already relatively weak. It didn’t possess much lethality against humans.</p>
<p>Humans who could fight on the front lines had some level of cultivation. After being shaken by the aftershocks, they would at most spit out blood.</p>
<p>After being shaken, the people from Sea Return City turned to look out. When they saw that the water bubbles that filled the sky had almost all burst and that countless crabs had died, they couldn’t help but be pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>They looked up and immediately saw Zhou Wen in the distant sky.</p>
<p>Sea Return City was several kilometers from the coastline. It wasn’t that they had good eyesight, allowing them to see Zhou Wen from such a distance.</p>
<p>It was because Zhou Wen was wearing the mirror-like Jade Crystal Spirit armor. When the sun shone on him, he was like a humanoid light source. It was difficult not to see him.</p>
<p>The might of String Aural Quake isn’t bad. Unfortunately, it’s too useless. I can only use it once. Zhou Wen glanced at the Golden Harp in his hand. A few of the strings had snapped, so he couldn’t use it again. All he could do was unsummon it and let it slowly recover.</p>
<p>The giant crab was very close to Zhou Wen. It staggered and nearly collapsed into the seawater. It couldn’t help but fly into a rage as it brandished its huge crab pincers and smashed them at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Although it was huge, it wasn’t clumsy at all. The crab pincer swung in front of Zhou Wen like a gust of wind.</p>
<p>At that moment, many people in the city were looking at the airborne Zhou Wen. They were given a fright when they saw the giant crab move like a ghost.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t flinch as he unsheathed his Bamboo Blade. At the same time, his body rapidly flashed in Transcendent Flying Immortal form as he struck out with Sky Slash.</p>
<p>The people in the city only saw the humanoid figure rapidly flicker around the giant crab like streams of light crisscrossing. When Zhou Wen stopped again, the giant crab stopped with its pincers raised in the air.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>The giant crab’s shell suddenly cracked open. The crab pincers it held up broke into several pieces and fell into the water, stirring up waves.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>In the end, even the giant crab’s body crumbled into a few pieces and fell into the sea. It couldn’t be more dead.</p>
<p>When the humans in the city saw this scene, they were momentarily taken aback. They stared blankly at the gigantic crab’s sorry state and at Zhou Wen, who was like a human-shaped sun in the sky.</p>
<p>Moments later, everyone finally reacted and cheered. The joy of escaping death was incomparable.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen rushed into the sea and vanished from everyone’s sight.</p>
<p>By the time he returned to Sea Return City, the Jade Crystal Spirit armor on his body had vanished. He looked like a young father carrying Ya’er. He wasn’t conspicuous at all.</p>
<p>However, there was an additional crab tattoo on Zhou Wen’s body. It was obtained from hatching the giant crab Companion Egg he had fished out from the sea.</p>
<p>Deep Blue Crab Sovereign: Mythical</p>
<p>Life Providence: Ocean Overlord</p>
<p>Life Soul: Heart of the Ocean</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Loss of Gravity</p>
<p>Strength: 80</p>
<p>Speed: 71</p>
<p>Constitution: 80</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 79</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Gravity Bubble, Overlord Pincer, Deep Sea Emperor</p>
<p>Companion Form: Mount</p>
<p>Is it an ocean mount? Not bad. Zhou Wen didn’t have an underwater mount yet. The Great Might Vajra Bull was afraid of water. It was fine for it to walk in a stream, but it was impossible for it to enter the sea.</p>
<p>The Earth Elemental Beast was of little use in water. He happened to lack an underwater mount.</p>
<p>However, the Deep Blue Crab Sovereign was too big. He probably couldn’t use it for tiny streams and rivers, so he could only use it in the ocean.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, my luck has been pretty good recently. I obtained such a good Mythical Companion Beast shortly after coming to Sea Return. Perhaps this is a lucky place for me, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<h3 id='chapter961'>Chapter 961: Sea God Reef</h3>
<p>“Why are you still loitering around? What if the child gets injured? Don’t you know the severity of the matter? Thankfully, a powerful human expert killed those giant crabs. Otherwise, if they were to rush into the city and something happened to the child, I’d like to see how you explain it to your wife when you return.” The middle-aged man bumped Zhou Wen again and reprimanded him.</p>
<p>“I’ll leave now,” Zhou Wen hurriedly said, knowing that he meant well.</p>
<p>“Stay at home and take care of the child. Children are our future,” the middle-aged man lectured Zhou Wen again. Before leaving, he didn’t forget to remind Zhou Wen to return.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carried the child and headed for a city gate in an opposite direction. He still needed to visit Sea God Reef. His luck today seemed pretty good. He had a feeling that he might find the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>The Sea God Reef was also known as the Dragon King Reef by the locals. Every time the tide receded, one could see a dragon-shaped reef surface above the sea like a divine dragon undulating over the sea.</p>
<p>Legend had it that the reef was originally formed by a divine dragon. As there were restrictions in the world, sea dragons couldn’t go ashore. However, the divine dragon’s newborn child was caught by a fisherman during one of its playful escapades.</p>
<p>In order to save its child, the divine dragon ignored the restrictions and rushed onto land to snatch back its child. However, because it had violated the restriction, it turned into a rock before returning to the sea. It had been left here ever since.</p>
<p>This was originally just a legend. Later, after the dimensional storms, an area near Sea God Reef became a dimensional zone. Many terrifying dimensional creatures appeared inside.</p>
<p>No one had really landed on Sea God Reef to this day. It was unknown if the Sea God Reef had transformed back into a divine dragon.</p>
<p>Now, Sea God Reef couldn’t be seen from the beach. In the shallow sea, there were many shrimp soldiers and crab generals. They were all powerful Epic existences. Legend had it that deeper in the Sea God Reef was the Turtle Minister, a powerful dimensional creature at the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Of course, no one dared to enter the deep sea, so they didn’t know if these legends were true.</p>
<p>There weren’t many people from Sea Return City who dared enter Sea God Reed. Zhou Wen didn’t encounter anyone when he arrived.</p>
<p>Before coming, Zhou Wen had contacted Li Xuan, but his call didn’t connect. The latter was probably in a dimensional zone.</p>
<p>“Young man, why aren’t you listening to my advice at all? Why are you running around with a child?” Zhou Wen had just arrived at the periphery of the Sea God Reef dimensional zone when he heard a familiar voice.</p>
<p>He turned his head and saw that it was indeed the middle-aged man from before.</p>
<p>“Brother, what a coincidence. Why are you here?” Zhou Wen asked the middle-aged man with a smile.</p>
<p>“The crabs that came ashore this time might be related to Sea God Reef, so I came to investigate. I say, what’s wrong with you? You’re already an adult and even have a child. Why can’t you weigh up the consequences?” the middle-aged man asked.</p>
<p>“This is my sister,” Zhou Wen explained.</p>
<p>“Then even more reason why you shouldn’t bring her to such a dangerous place. Your mother is already so old. How much effort and risk did she endure to give birth to a daughter? If anything happens, how are you going to answer your parents?” The middle-aged man tried his best to educate Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to explain, he suddenly heard a dragon’s roar coming from the sea. The two of them subconsciously turned their heads and saw that the dragon’s roar was coming from the direction of Sea God Reef.</p>
<p>However, as they were still in the area outside the dimensional zone, the sea was covered in fog. They couldn’t see anything clearly. They could only find out by walking in.</p>
<p>“Quickly send your sister back. If you want to take risks, do it yourself. Don’t joke around with the child’s safety,” the middle-aged man exhorted Zhou Wen before running towards Sea God Reef.</p>
<p>“Brother, we don’t know what’s going on inside. It’s best you don’t enter,” Zhou Wen reminded him out of goodwill.</p>
<p>“My job is to investigate the nearby dimensional zones. If there’s any danger, I have to sound the warning ahead of time. Go back quickly. I have to figure out what happened here,” the middle-aged man said as he rushed into the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally didn’t plan on entering and only wanted to search for the tiny palm symbol outside. However, seeing that the middle-aged man wasn’t a bad person, he thought for a moment and decided to enter. If anything really happened, he could help him.</p>
<p>In this day and age, there weren’t many people who were willing to care about others. Zhou Wen really didn’t want anything to happen to him.</p>
<p>He walked into the fog with Ya’er in his arms. The fog looked so thick that it couldn’t be dispelled, but when Zhou Wen walked in, he saw a beautiful golden beach.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man was standing on the beach, staring blankly at the sea.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen traced his gaze and his eyes lit up. He saw a golden divine dragon frolicking in the seawater. Its scales seemed to be gilded as they shimmered with a mysterious glow under the sunlight.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had his fair share of grand experiences. He had seen many dragons and had killed some before. He quickly reacted and hurriedly used Grand Turtle Aura to converge his aura to the limits to prevent himself from attracting the golden dragon’s attention.</p>
<p>The aura on the golden dragon was comparable to the white dragon Zhou Wen had seen at the bottom of Dragon’s Well. They were extremely terrifying existences, so Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to fight it without understanding its abilities.</p>
<p>The golden dragon didn’t seem to care about the insect-like humans as it swam in the sea. It seemed to be in a good mood.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man snapped out of his shock. Clearly, he knew very well that he was nothing compared to the golden dragon. He slowly retreated, hoping to leave the Sea God Reef dimensional zone.</p>
<p>After taking a few steps back, he saw Zhou Wen hugging Ya’er. His expression changed immediately.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly gestured for him to remain silent to prevent him from alarming the golden dragon.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the middle-aged man wasn’t stupid. He knew that he couldn’t alarm the golden dragon, so he didn’t plan on speaking. He held back his tirade on Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The two of them slowly retreated. They didn’t dare to retreat too quickly as they moved step by step.</p>
<p>However, not long after, the golden dragon seemed to sense something and turned to look at Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>The dragon’s golden, crystalline eyes lit up when it saw them. Then, half its body extended out of the sea and stared at them.</p>
<p>We’re doomed! The man’s heart trembled. Being targeted by such a terrifying creature, his chances of survival were slim.</p>
<p>The golden dragon stared at them for a while before suddenly raising its head and letting out a shocking dragon roar.</p>
<p>Accompanying the dragon roar, the originally calm surface of the sea instantly broke into turmoil. Then, Zhou Wen and the middle-aged man saw rows of strange-looking shrimp soldiers and crab generals rush up the coast.</p>
<p>“Leave quickly…” The middle-aged man pulled Zhou Wen and turned to rush out of the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>However, when he turned his head, he saw rows of shrimp soldiers and crab generals standing behind them at some point in time. They had long sealed off their retreat.</p>
<h3 id='chapter962'>Chapter 962: Dragon Palace</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The shrimp soldiers and crab generals looked terrifying. They stood up upright and were about two to three meters tall. Their faces were strange, and the shells on their bodies were in battle armor form. Their limbs were still as sharp as blades, giving them a ferocious and terrifying feeling. They didn’t have the cuteness and charm they had on the dining table.</p>
<p>However, the shrimp soldiers and crab generals only blocked their path and didn’t immediately attack.</p>
<p>More shrimp soldiers and crab generals had already arrived on the beach. There were thousands of them. It was unknown how many there were, but they had already surrounded the trio.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man’s expression was nasty as he sighed and said to Zhou Wen, “I told you not to take risks with the child around, but you refused to listen. There’s no chance of leaving now.”</p>
<p>“They don’t seem to have any animosity towards us.” Zhou Wen found it odd. Typically, dimensional creatures would attack humans immediately, but these shrimp soldiers and crabs were in an orderly formation without showing any signs of aggression.</p>
<p>“Is there a need for animosity. Just a mouthful of saliva from each of them can kill us.” The middle-aged man summoned his Companion Beast and planned on risking his life. Then, he said to Zhou Wen, “Although it’s probably impossible for a chance to appear, escape anytime there’s an opening once the fight breaks out.”</p>
<p>With that said, the middle-aged man prepared to charge forward and fight the shrimp soldiers and crab generals who blocked the way.</p>
<p>However, at that moment, the shrimp soldiers and crab generals suddenly parted to the side and opened up a path. A huge, black-armored turtle that was twenty to thirty meters tall walked over like a human. It carried a tusk spear.</p>
<p>Looking at the strange humanoid turtle with bulging muscles and ferocious armor, the middle-aged man was alarmed. Can it be the legendary Mythical creature, Turtle Minister?</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The Turtle Minister walked in front of them step by step. With every step, it was as though a mountain was moving horizontally, causing the ground to tremble. It stabbed the tusk spear on its shoulder into the ground, and the weight of the spear immediately stabbed a huge hole in the beach. A shock wave surged out from the yellow sand beside it, giving it an extremely powerful aura.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man gritted his teeth. Although he knew that he was no match for the creature, he couldn’t just sit idle as death approached. He would kill whatever he could before dying.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to engage in battle, he suddenly saw the Turtle Minister kneel down on one knee respectfully. He bowed at Zhou Wen and lowered his head as he said in a thunderous voice, “My lord, my master invites you to enter the sea for a gathering. I hope you can agree. I’ll be very grateful.”</p>
<p>The middle-aged man was somewhat dumbfounded. He stared blankly at the Turtle Minister who was kneeling on one knee, almost believing that he was dreaming.</p>
<p>The legendary Mythical creature, Turtle Minister, actually bowed to the young man and respectfully addressed him as lord. It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man looked at Zhou Wen with an odd expression. He was beginning to suspect that Zhou Wen was a terrifying dimensional creature disguised as a human.</p>
<p>“Who’s your master?” Zhou Wen looked in the direction of the sea, but the golden dragon had vanished.</p>
<p>“Sir, you have already met my master. Now, my master is waiting for you in the Dragon Palace,” said the Turtle Minister.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll meet your master. This person has no ill intentions towards you. Let him leave,” Zhou Wen said as he pointed at the middle-aged man.</p>
<p>“We will obey your orders, my lord.” The Turtle Minister stood up and waved his hand. The shrimp soldiers blocking the way immediately made way.</p>
<p>“Dimensional creatures are ferocious and ruthless. It’s best you don’t take risks,” the middle-aged man said hesitantly.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. It’s just a Dragon Palace. It can’t trap me. Go back now,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man wore a strange expression, but he couldn’t say anything else. He turned around and headed for the exit of the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>The shrimp soldiers didn’t stop him as expected. They lined up and welcomed Zhou Wen into the sea like a procession.</p>
<p>The shrimp soldiers and crab generals lined up on both sides, parting the seawater. It was as though a curtain had been lifted, revealing a path that led deep into the sea.</p>
<p>When the middle-aged man saw Zhou Wen carry the child into the sea, he gritted his teeth and left the dimensional zone. When he arrived outside the dimensional zone, he looked back at the misty beach and sea. He felt as though he had been dreaming.</p>
<p>A dimensional creature from myths would actually kneel to a human youth. I’m afraid no one will believe me even if I tell them, right? The middle-aged man even wondered if he had been hallucinating.</p>
<p>The Turtle Minister led the way as Zhou Wen walked deep into the sea. The underwater scenery was gorgeous and mysterious. In the seawater that resembled a curtain, there were all sorts of sea creatures wandering everywhere.</p>
<p>He even saw a few beautiful women lying in clams. They were probably the legendary Clam Fairies.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had always believed that the sea dragons lived in the underwater palace. Just like the famous Crystal Palace was the residence of the East Sea Dragon King.</p>
<p>However, this dragon king didn’t seem too particular. When Zhou Wen arrived at the so-called Dragon Palace, he realized that it was a huge shipwreck. Zhou Wen didn’t know much about ships, nor did he know what type of shipwreck it was. However, from the scale of the ship, Zhou Wen guessed that it was likely an aircraft carrier—humanity’s top marine combat unit before the dimensional storms.</p>
<p>However, after the dimensional storms, the aircraft carriers, various fleets, and cruise ships had mostly been sunk by dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Even if this ship wasn’t an aircraft carrier, it didn’t look anything like a Dragon Palace.</p>
<p>The sunken ship seemed to be protected by some force, preventing the seawater from approaching it. Zhou Wen followed the Turtle Minister to the deck. The Turtle Minister knelt on one knee again and lowered his head towards the cabin. “Master, the lord is here to meet you.”</p>
<p>“My lord, please follow me.” A graceful clam woman walked over and bowed at Zhou Wen before extending an inviting gesture.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed her into the cabin and quickly arrived at a relatively large cabin space.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was wondering how the gigantic golden dragon entered the cabin, he saw a voluptuous woman wearing golden armor. She had dragon horns on her head and golden hair. She sat on the wide chair opposite him like a queen.</p>
<p>However, the chair didn’t look like the legendary Dragon King Coral Throne. Instead, it looked like a chair in front of a human warship’s console.</p>
<p>So that golden dragon is actually female. It can even take human form! Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised as he couldn’t help but size up the dragon queen.</p>
<p>The dragon queen had fair skin, but her irises were golden. She looked at Zhou Wen and asked, “Are you the spokesperson of the Ancient Dragons?”</p>
<p>“What Ancient Dragons? I’ve never heard of them,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“If you’re not the representative of the Ancient Dragons, why do you have the keepsake of the Ancient Dragons?” the dragon queen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“A keepsake of the Ancient Dragons?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback before he thought of something. He took out the dragon tooth pendant on his neck and said, “Are you talking about this? This was carved by my teacher using a dragon tooth. It’s just an ordinary gift, not a keepsake.”</p>
<p>The dragon queen sized up Zhou Wen for a while. “Since you have the Ancient Dragons’ keepsake, no matter where you got it from, you are the representative of the Ancient Dragons. From today onwards, you are the son-in-law of my Dragon Palace.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter963'>Chapter 963: Heavenly Happiness Token</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the dragon queen in surprise. He never expected her to say such a thing even in his wildest imagination.</p>
<p>He was a pure human, while the dragon queen was a dimensional creature. They weren’t of the same species. How could he become the son-in-law of the Dragon Palace?</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen had never thought of marriage. All he could do was say, “Thank you for your kindness, but I have no intention of getting married.”</p>
<p>When the dragon queen heard Zhou Wen’s answer, her expression immediately turned cold. “You can only choose one of two choices—die or become the Dragon Palace’s son-in-law.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the dragon queen with an odd expression and asked, “There are plenty of humans. If you want to get married, many human men should be willing. Why must you choose me?”</p>
<p>The dragon queen said with a cold expression, “A mere human doesn’t even have the right to look at me.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t I human?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>The dragon queen didn’t answer. She only stared at him coldly and said, “Answer me immediately. Are you willing to become the Dragon Palace’s son-in-law or do you want to die here?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I don’t plan on getting married.” Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t choose to be the Dragon Palace’s son-in-law. They weren’t of the same species.</p>
<p>The dragon queen immediately turned hostile. “Take him down.”</p>
<p>With the order issued by the dragon queen, a shrimp soldier immediately rushed forward and thrust its shrimp-headed spear at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used his movement technique and rushed towards the cabin’s exit.</p>
<p>The row of shrimp soldiers guarding the exit also thrust their spears at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen unsheathed Bamboo Blade and sliced off the shrimp-headed spear in front of him. Zhou Wen carried Ya’er to the deck.</p>
<p>The Turtle Minister was standing on the deck. His previous humble attitude was completely gone. He carried the huge spear and smashed it at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The spear was fast and ferocious. Furthermore, it was extremely heavy. Zhou Wen guessed that his Strength probably couldn’t withstand such a powerful attack, so he could only use his movement technique to dodge.</p>
<p>The Turtle Minister brandished the spear like a raging wind sweeping away fallen leaves. His massive body didn’t show any signs of clumsiness. Zhou Wen dodged left and right. Although he dodged the attacks, he was momentarily unable to shake off the Turtle Minister.</p>
<p>The Turtle Minister is already so ferocious. That dragon queen must be even more terrifying. Zhou Wen didn’t panic. He had the ability to teleport and conceal himself. Even if he couldn’t defeat her, he could escape.</p>
<p>This fellow is completely different from the Turtle Prime Minister in myths and legends. He’s practically a super Berserker! Zhou Wen realized that the Turtle Minister was becoming more and more ferocious as the battle progressed. Furthermore, it was invulnerable. Zhou Wen’s attacks didn’t pose much of a threat to it, so he didn’t wish to be entangled with it. He directly switched to the New Era Life Soul and used his teleportation ability to rush out of the Dragon Palace and into the sea.</p>
<p>No matter how ferocious the Turtle Minister was, he couldn’t catch up to Zhou Wen who had teleported. After a few teleportations, Zhou Wen had already left the Turtle Minister in the dust.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to swim out of the sea, he suddenly saw a golden figure flash. It was the dragon queen in golden dragon scales. She had a hot figure, but her fists were even more explosive than her figure. With a single punch, the seawater formed a terrifying vortex under her fist, causing Zhou Wen’s body to involuntarily be sucked towards her fist.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly used teleportation to rush out of the terrifying fist’s range, but just as he teleported out, the dragon queen appeared in front of him. The terrifying fist was about to land on Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to teleport again, but he failed to escape the dragon queen despite teleporting several times. Every time he teleported, the dragon queen would appear in front of him.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that Zhou Wen should have escaped the sea after teleporting so many times. Yet, instead of arriving at the beach, all he could see was endless seawater as though he was still deep in the sea.</p>
<p>“Where we are is known as Deep Blue. No matter how powerful you are, you won’t be able to escape the sea. Agree to becoming the Dragon Palace’s son-in-law and I can still spare you,” the dragon queen said as she pursued Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What do you see in me? I’ll change, alright?” Zhou Wen said speechlessly.</p>
<p>“Unless you die, you have to become the Dragon Palace’s son-in-law.” The dragon queen wasn’t human. She couldn’t hear the sarcasm in Zhou Wen’s words.</p>
<p>“You are a dragon and I’m a human. We aren’t of the same species. It’s impossible for us to copulate,” Zhou Wen said as he dodged. At the same time, he was thinking of a way to escape.</p>
<p>“Who said I’m copulating with you? I want you to become the Dragon Palace’s son-in-law by marrying my sister. She has half a human’s bloodline,” said the dragon queen.</p>
<p>“Wait, you mean you want me to marry your sister? But I’ve never seen your sister. Who’s your sister?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>The dragon queen stood opposite Zhou Wen and didn’t continue attacking. She took out a clam and opened it. Immediately, light shot out from the shell like a holographic projection. The light condensed into a woman’s figure.</p>
<p>“Qin Ling!” Zhou Wen cried out when he saw the woman’s figure.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, that figure was none other than Qin Ling. It was impossible to mistake it.</p>
<p>“You’ve met her? That’s great. In that case, stay in the Dragon Palace and wait to marry my sister,” said the dragon queen.</p>
<p>“Wait!” Zhou Wen extended his hand to stop the dragon queen who was about to capture him. He looked at the dragon queen and said, “If your sister is really Qin Ling, she already has a fiancé and they have a good relationship. I think even if I were willing to marry her, she wouldn’t be willing to marry me. I think you are mistaken. It’s best you ask your sister first.”</p>
<p>The dragon queen said coldly, “Ordinary humans aren’t qualified to marry my sister.”</p>
<p>“Your sister’s fiancé isn’t an ordinary human. He’s very talented and will definitely become a top expert in the future. He’s far better than me…” Zhou Wen praised Feng Qiuyun to no end.</p>
<p>However, his words were sincere. Feng Qiuyan’s talent was indeed unparalleled. Furthermore, he was very diligent, no less than Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“It’s useless no matter how outstanding he is. Without the recognition of the dimension’s rules, it’s impossible for them to marry,” said the dragon queen.</p>
<p>“What dimension’s rules? I’m also a human. If he isn’t acknowledged, I won’t be acknowledged either, right?” Zhou Wen was even more puzzled.</p>
<p>“You are different. You have already been acknowledged,” said the dragon queen.</p>
<p>“I’ve been acknowledged? When?” Zhou Wen was even more puzzled. He didn’t have a seal of approval on his head, so why did the dragon queen say that he had been acknowledged?</p>
<p>The dragon queen snorted and said, “You’re still acting dumb. Do you think I don’t recognize the Heavenly Happiness Token?”</p>
<p>“Heavenly Happiness Token?” Zhou Wen immediately realized something as he hurriedly took out the stone token that Emperor of Shang had given him. “You mean this?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter964'>Chapter 964: Seven Seas Dragon King</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“That’s right,” said the dragon queen as she nodded at the stone token.</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, it’s very simple. I can give it to your sister’s fiancé. That way, they can be legitimate,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“The Heavenly Happiness Token has already bound you. What’s the point of giving it to him?” The dragon queen snorted coldly.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, why did Emperor of Shang give me such a token? I really don’t want to get married. Zhou Wen was filled with regret. If he had known this would happen, he wouldn’t have wanted the token.</p>
<p>However, on second thought, Feng Qiuyan’s fiancée was indeed not human. At the very least, she wasn’t a pure human. What Feng Qiuyan saw when he was young probably wasn’t wrong.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, actually, it doesn’t matter if there’s a token. I think your sister and my schoolmate, Feng Qiuyan, are truly in love. Why do you have to separate them?” Zhou Wen wanted to use words to move the dragon queen.</p>
<p>On careful thought, this dragon queen was considered Feng Qiuyan’s sister-in-law. They would all be family in the future, so fighting her wasn’t a good idea.</p>
<p>“Without the Heavenly Happiness Token, whatever you say is useless. If we can’t use the Heavenly Happiness Token to reverse her fate and break the taboo, she can only become the concubine of the Seven Seas Dragon King,” said the dragon queen.</p>
<p>“What Seven Seas Dragon King?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled when he heard that. He had only heard of the Four Seas Dragon King. What the hell was the Seven Seas Dragon King? Why would Qin Ling become his concubine?</p>
<p>Since the dragon queen needed Zhou Wen’s help, she had no choice but to patiently explain, “This sea is called the Seven Dragons Sea. In fact, it’s a huge dimensional zone. The Sea God Reef is only a tiny dimensional zone in it. In every dimensional zone like the Sea God Reef, there’s a dragon monarch. However, the supreme ruler of the Seven Dragons Sea is the Seven Seas Dragon King. He’s the supreme existence that rules over everything in the Seven Dragons Sea.”</p>
<p>After explaining everything, Zhou Wen finally had a clearer understanding of the entire matter.</p>
<p>Dragons were extremely lascivious by nature. In fact, the seven dragon monarch domains in the Seven Dragons Sea were the harem bases of the Seven Seas Dragon King. Once a new female dragon was born, they would be added to the Seven Seas Dragon King’s harem.</p>
<p>The dragon queen’s father was the Dragon King of the Sea God Reef, and her mother was also a dragon. As the Seven Seas Dragon King wanted her mother for his own, the old Dragon King of the Sea God Reef fought the Seven Seas Dragon King and was ultimately killed by him.</p>
<p>Her mother was also severely injured in that battle and was saved by a human. Later on, for some reason, her mother and that human had Qin Ling before she passed away.</p>
<p>The Seven Seas Dragon King didn’t kill them all and made the dragon queen the dragon monarch of the Sea God Reef. However, the Seven Seas Dragon King didn’t do it out of goodwill. He was waiting for the dragon queen and Qin Ling to grow up. Once they grew up, they had to become Seven Seas Dragon King concubines.</p>
<p>“Have you never thought of killing the Seven Seas Dragon King?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“The Seven Seas Dragon King is a Terror-grade existence. Even if the seven dragon monarchs join forces, they are no match for him,” the dragon queen said indifferently.</p>
<p>Terror-grade? Zhou Wen felt his head ache when he heard that. Banana Fairy’s evolution hadn’t been completed, so he didn’t have a good solution to deal with Terror-grade existences.</p>
<p>“Can’t you escape inland with your sister? The world is so huge. It’s impossible for the Seven Seas Dragon King to find you, right?” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>The dragon queen nodded and said, “I think so too. However, we are limited by the dimensional zones. It’s impossible for us to leave the sea. I can’t even leave the dimensional zone. My sister’s partial human bloodline allows her to leave the dimensional zone, but she can’t be too far from the sea. Unless…”</p>
<p>With that said, the dragon queen didn’t continue as she looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood what she meant and said, “The Heavenly Happiness Token on me can remove the dimensional zones’ restrictions on her, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. That’s why the person she marries can only be you. She can use the Heavenly Happiness Token’s power to escape the dimensional zone’s restrictions on her,” the dragon queen said.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen shook his head and said, “I only have one Heavenly Happiness Token. Even if I can save Qin Ling, I can’t save you, right?”</p>
<p>“I’ll handle my own matters. You just need to marry Qin Ling and take her inland,” the dragon queen said.</p>
<p>“Impossible.” Zhou Wen shook his head.</p>
<p>“If you don’t do it, you’ll die,” the dragon queen said with a cold expression.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the dragon queen and continued, “It would be okay if I didn’t know about this, but now that I do, I’ll feel terrible if I watch the tragedy happen to you and your sister without doing anything. If you are willing, please let me help you kill the Seven Seas Dragon King and save your sister and the entire Seven Dragons Sea.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself that this might be a good opportunity. He might be able to obtain immense benefits while the Seven Dragons Sea was in chaos.</p>
<p>The dragon queen looked at Zhou Wen as though she was looking at a fool. “Do you know what a Terror-grade existence is? It’s an existence that can kill you thousands of times with one finger.”</p>
<p>“Actually, I’ve seen a few of them. They aren’t as terrifying as you make them out to be. If you believe me, give me some more time and I’ll definitely be able to save you.” Zhou Wen thought about how he could convince the dragon queen to become his spy in the Seven Dragons Sea.</p>
<p>“Forget about giving you more time; it’s impossible for a human like you to defeat the Seven Seas Dragon King. Besides, there’s no time. According to the dragons’ standards, Qin Ling will be an adult in six months,” said the dragon queen.</p>
<p>“What about you?” Zhou Wen asked the dragon queen.</p>
<p>“Less than a month.” The dragon queen hesitated for a moment before answering Zhou Wen’s question.</p>
<p>“Less than a month?” Zhou Wen pondered.</p>
<p>It was clearly very difficult to advance to the Terror stage. Zhou Wen didn’t know if Banana Fairy could complete her advancement in a month.</p>
<p>“Stop dreaming. There’s only one path for you now. Marry Qin Ling and take her inland so that the Seven Seas Dragon King can never find her,” the dragon queen said.</p>
<p>“If I want to take anyone away, you should be the one taken away.” Zhou Wen meant that Qin Ling still had six months, while the dragon queen only had a month left. He naturally had to rescue her first. They could still stall for time for Qin Ling to think of a solution.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>However, these words sounded different to the dragon queen. She looked at Zhou Wen in a daze.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t think there was anything wrong with his words, nor did he notice the dragon queen’s abnormality. He was now thinking that this might be a huge opportunity.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>It was very difficult to kill a Terror-grade dimensional creature, but with the help of a traitor, there might still be a chance.</p>
<p>According to the dragon queen, the seven dragon monarchs of the Seven Dragons Sea probably didn’t have a good impression of the Seven Seas Dragon King. They might even hate him to the core. If he could incite internal strife, he might have a chance to kill the Seven Seas Dragon King.</p>
<p>It was unrealistic to kill the Seven Seas Dragon King in its Terror form, but a Terror-grade existence wasn’t always in a Terror form. If he could take advantage of it, he might not need to wait for Banana Fairy to complete her evolution.</p>
<p>“You should have a name, right? How should I address you?” Zhou Wen asked the dragon queen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter965'>Chapter 965: Miya</h3>
<p>“Miya,” the dragon queen answered.</p>
<p>“Miya, taking Qin Ling away actually isn’t a good idea. The dimensional zones will definitely be lifted in the future. When the time comes, will the Seven Seas Dragon King let her off? I’m afraid the hatred will only deepen when the time comes. If she’s caught, it will be even worse. The only solution is to kill the Seven Seas Dragon King. Only then can you and your sister obtain true liberation,” Zhou Wen said with a sincere expression. “We can first deal with the Seven Seas Dragon King. Can you tell me what kind of dimensional creature the Seven Seas Dragon King is?”</p>
<p>“Unless I can advance to the Terror grade, there’s no hope.” Although Miya said that, she still informed Zhou Wen about the situation with the Seven Seas Dragon King.</p>
<p>As Miya’s father had once risked his life against the Seven Seas Dragon King, Miya had personally witnessed the battle. She knew the abilities of the Seven Seas Dragon King quite well.</p>
<p>However, even Miya didn’t understand some of the abilities used by the Seven Seas Dragon King. Therefore, when she explained them, some of them were just in narrative form.</p>
<p>According to Miya, the Seven Seas Dragon King didn’t seem to be a divine dragon in the traditional sense. It had seven dragon heads and its body was huge. Every dragon head had unparalleled strength.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as long as one was grabbed by the Seven Seas Dragon King, it would be difficult for them to escape.</p>
<p>Back then, Miya’s father’s combat strength was extremely high. With the accolade as Golden Dragon King, he was a top-notch existence in the Seven Dragon Seas thanks to having the strongest combat strength. The Golden Dragon Body was almost immortal.</p>
<p>However, after being grabbed by the Seven Seas Dragon King, the Golden Dragon Body was unable to withstand the terrifying power. In the end, Miya watched as her father’s Golden Dragon Body was devoured by the Seven Seas Dragon King.</p>
<p>“Does every dragon head of the Seven Sea Dragon King have different attributes? For example, wind, fire, thunder, lightning, etc?” Zhou Wen thought of Orochi he had seen before.</p>
<p>“No. The powers of the seven dragon heads are the same. They can spew out a terrifying liquid. Once one is touched by the liquid, their bodies will become immobile. Their only fate is to wait to be slaughtered,” said Miya.</p>
<p>“What’s its Terror form?” Zhou Wen asked in detail.</p>
<p>“I didn’t see it. When it used the Terror form, the sea produced huge waves. All I could see were terrifying dragons tumbling in the waves. I couldn’t see its full appearance,” Miya answered.</p>
<p>“From what you said, if you are willing to join forces with me, we might have a chance of killing the Seven Seas Dragon King. If you can contact the other six dragon monarchs and get their help, the chances are even higher,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You can’t even defeat me. What makes you think you can kill the Seven Seas Dragon King?” Although Miya still retorted, she didn’t say that Zhou Wen was delusional for some reason.</p>
<p>“Who said I’m not your match? I’m just unwilling to use my true strength to harm you,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Miya looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Then show me your true strength. Unless you really have the strength to convince me, I definitely won’t let Qin Ling take such a risk.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that Miya’s combat strength was powerful. Her Strength and Constitution seemed to be in no way inferior to Tyrant Behemoth. It wouldn’t be easy to defeat her.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen was known as the man with the most Companion Beasts and they were also of the highest quality on Earth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth who landed in front of Miya. He looked at Miya and asked, “Do you know what this is?”</p>
<p>“Tyrant Behemoth. I’ve seen it on the rankings. So its owner is you.” Miya was slightly surprised. She never expected Zhou Wen to have a powerful Companion Beast like Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>However, although Tyrant Behemoth was powerful, Miya didn’t believe that she was inferior to Tyrant Behemoth. Even if Zhou Wen was Tyrant Behemoth’s master, he definitely didn’t have the ability to challenge the Seven Seas Dragon King. Even she and Turtle Minister couldn’t.</p>
<p>“Do you believe me now?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Although Tyrant Behemoth is strong, it might not be able to defeat me,” said Miya.</p>
<p>“Then, what if we add on these?” Zhou Wen began summoning his Companion Beasts. He summoned the three Demon Blood True Dragons, Light Concealment Sword, and Deep Blue Crab Sovereign.</p>
<p>When Miya saw that Zhou Wen had so many Mythical Companion Beasts, she couldn’t help but be alarmed. She began to believe Zhou Wen’s words.</p>
<p>“No matter how many ordinary Mythical Companion Beasts there are, it’s impossible for them to kill the Seven Seas Dragon King. The Terror grade is an existence on a different level. It’s not something that can be defeated with numbers alone,” said Miya.</p>
<p>“It’s not just quantity. There’s also quality.” Zhou Wen summoned Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>“Torch Dragon!” Miya recognized Torch Dragon at a glance.</p>
<p>Dragons were probably dimensional creatures with the most branches. There were almost countless dragon-type creatures. Some dragons weren’t very strong, and they couldn’t even reach the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>However, some dragons were terrifyingly strong and could even fight Calamity-grade existences.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon was undoubtedly one of the most terrifying existences among dragon-type creatures. As a dragon, Miya naturally recognized it.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, it’s still a youngling. If it can reach adulthood and transform into its Terror form, it might really be able to kill the Seven Seas Dragon King,” said Miya in disappointment after carefully observing Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>“Even if it’s still young, it’s still Torch Dragon. Its Bright Torch Vision World should still be of some use against the Seven Seas Dragon King. Furthermore, we don’t need to fight it head-on. As long as you tell me the details of the Seven Seas Dragon King, I can think of a way to assassinate it without it transforming into its Terror form…” Zhou Wen continued persuading Miya.</p>
<p>“It’s too dangerous. There’s almost no chance of success,” said Miya after some thought.</p>
<p>“As long as you believe me, we can think of a solution. I’ll rescue you and your sister from the sea of bitterness…” Zhou Wen knew that it wouldn’t be easy to make Miya believe him.</p>
<p>After all, they were facing the Terror-grade Seven Seas Dragon King. However, Zhou Wen needed Miya’s help, so he could only patiently win her trust.</p>
<p>“What do you want to do?” Miya asked after some hesitation.</p>
<p>“Do you think we can convince the other six dragon monarchs?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Absolutely impossible,” answered Miya with certainty.</p>
<p>“Why? Aren’t they also oppressed by Seven Seas Dragon Kings? Don’t they want to resist?” Zhou Wen said in disbelief.</p>
<p>“That’s if you have the ability to resist. Other than me, the other dragon monarchs won’t risk their lives to resist,” Miya said with certainty.</p>
<p>“In that case, tell me the situation of the other six dragon monarchs and their dimensional zones. Perhaps I can think of a solution.” Zhou Wen wanted to obtain as much information as possible.</p>
<p>Miya explained the situation in the Seven Dragon Seas in detail to Zhou Wen, making him sigh at how good it felt to have a spy providing information. He didn’t need to go anywhere to understand the situation in the Seven Dragon Seas clearly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter966'>Chapter 966: Dragon Pearl Companion Egg</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>After Zhou Wen figured out the situation in the Seven Dragons Sea, he realized that they weren’t proper dragon monarchs.</p>
<p>Miya was already considered the most normal dragon in the Seven Dragons Sea. According to her, the dragon monarchs in the other six dimensional zones didn’t have true dragon forms.</p>
<p>Some looked like crocodiles, some looked like lobsters, and one looked like a whale. However, because all of them had some dragon blood in them, they called themselves dragon monarchs.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>That Seven Seas Dragon King shouldn’t be a purebred dragon king. In Zhou Wen’s impression, a purebred dragon king had to be like the white dragon in Dragon’s Well.</p>
<p>If it were any other time, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have gone to unknown dimensional zones to kill the dimensional creatures. However, with Miya’s intelligence, things were different.</p>
<p>As long as Miya’s information was correct, it wasn’t difficult for Zhou Wen to rush into the dimensional zones to kill the dragon monarchs. After all, it was impossible for those single Mythical creatures to be a match for his divine pet lineup.</p>
<p>“Do you think that if we were to fight the Seven Seas Dragon King to the death, those dragon monarchs would help him and become our enemy?” Zhou Wen slowly got more information from Miya.</p>
<p>“If the Seven Seas Dragon King summons them, they wouldn’t dare disobey orders,” said Miya.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll get rid of the trouble first. Wait for my good news in the Dragon Palace,” Zhou Wen said as he prepared to leave.</p>
<p>“Stop,” Miya called out.</p>
<p>Does that not work? Zhou Wen believed that Miya had seen through his thoughts.</p>
<p>“You are a human after all. If you walk in the sea, you will definitely be discovered. Here’s a dragon pearl. Take it with you. As long as you aren’t close to a Mythical creature, it will be difficult to discover you. It also provides a certain level of water warding.” Miya handed a pearl to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“How can I accept this?” Zhou Wen looked at the bead and was somewhat embarrassed to take it.</p>
<p>He only wanted to use Miya’s intelligence to achieve his goal of killing monsters. He felt somewhat embarrassed that Miya would give him something.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing; you are risking your life for us sisters after all.” Miya clearly believed that Zhou Wen really wanted to help them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen blushed slightly. Although he did wish to help Miya and Qin Ling, he mostly wanted to use Miya’s intelligence to kill dimensional creatures to obtain more resources.</p>
<p>“Ahem, alright then. I’ll take it. I’ll return it to you in the future.” Zhou Wen took the dragon pearl and realized that it was a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to be surprised. This is something my father left behind after he died. Since you want to help us sisters, let it aid you. If you have the ability, you can hatch it and use it to fight the Seven Seas Dragon King,” said Miya.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was really embarrassed as a result. Miya seemed to completely trust him. It made Zhou Wen feel uneasy that she was willing to give him such a thing.</p>
<p>He had originally planned on helping as much as he could. All he needed to do was do his best. If he really wasn’t a match for him, he could retreat.</p>
<p>However, seeing that Miya seemed to have placed all her hopes on him, he felt a little uncomfortable running away if he really couldn’t kill the Seven Seas Dragon King.</p>
<p>You trust people too easily. If you were to encounter someone evil in the future, you might even end up helping them count the money they received from selling you. Zhou Wen sighed inwardly and put away the dragon pearl Companion Egg before leaving the Sea God Reef dimensional zone.</p>
<p>I should let Feng Qiuyan know about this matter first. Otherwise, I won’t be able to kill the Seven Seas Dragon King. Once the Seven Seas Dragon King takes revenge, I wonder if it will implicate the entire Feng family because of Qin Ling. Zhou Wen decided to return to the Feng family first. After telling Feng Qiuyan about this matter, it wouldn’t be too late to head to the other six dimensional zones in the Seven Dragons Sea.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen left Sea God Reef, he bumped into someone. The person was walking in the direction of Sea God Reef and was taken aback when he saw Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Are you going to the Dragon Palace?” Zhou Wen asked her. This person was naturally Qin Ling. She clearly wanted to go to the Sea God Reef.</p>
<p>“What Dragon Palace? I just want to go to Sea God Reef to hunt dimensional creatures,” Qin Ling said.</p>
<p>“I’ve met Miya,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Qin Ling’s expression immediately changed as she bit her lip and stared at Zhou Wen. “Will you tell Qiuyan about me?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Zhou Wen answered with certainty.</p>
<p>Qin Ling’s pupils immediately constricted as she stared intently at Zhou Wen. A terrifying aura rose from her body as her originally black pupils turned golden. Even her skin began to show faint golden scales. Her strength was clearly nothing like an Epic being.</p>
<p>She had half a Golden Dragon bloodline. Apart from the Epic strength of humans, there was an even more terrifying power hidden in her body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if a mixed-blood like her could inherit all the power of the Golden Dragon. Even if she couldn’t, she was much stronger than an ordinary human’s body.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell Qiuyan about this,” Qin Ling said through gritted teeth as she stared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“He has the right to know.” Zhou Wen looked at Qin Ling without backing down.</p>
<p>The killing intent in Qin Ling’s eyes burned as she slowly raised her palm. Her nails also turned pale gold like sharp daggers.</p>
<p>However, in the end, Qin Ling still lowered her hand and her body gradually returned to her original human appearance.</p>
<p>“Leave. You can tell Qiuyan that I won’t return.” As Qin Ling spoke, she turned around and walked towards the Sea God Reef dimensional zone.</p>
<p>“Would you be willing to give up just like that? Why don’t you give it a try? Perhaps Feng Qiuyan doesn’t mind,” Zhou Wen said as he looked at Qin Ling’s back.</p>
<p>“How can he not mind? I’m not a human, but a monster. No one can accept a monster like me as their wife. He suffered a fright back when he saw my true body during his childhood. Why should I frighten him a second time?” As Qin Ling spoke, she charged into the Sea God Reef.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched as Qin Ling’s figure vanished into the fog, only to hear someone sigh nearby. “I never expected Little Yanyan’s fiancée to really be nonhuman.”</p>
<p>Li Xuan walked over. He had seen the message Zhou Wen had left him. He had originally come to look for Zhou Wen, but he never expected to hear their conversation.</p>
<p>“You are better with words. I’ll leave this matter of telling Feng Qiuyan to you,” Zhou Wen said to Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“I never like to say things that make people sad. It’s best you say it yourself.” Li Xuan shook his head in rejection.</p>
<p>“It might not be a bad thing,” Zhou Wen said as he walked in the direction of the Feng family. Some things had to be faced eventually. Furthermore, Zhou Wen felt that Feng Qiuyan was already mentally prepared.</p>
<p>The two of them returned to the Feng family residence and found Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>“Coach, you were the one who killed the giant crab at sea, right? Now, all of Sea Return is discussing your deeds. They want to know who you are…” Feng Qiuyan said.</p>
<p>“We’ll talk about this in the future. Is there a place where we can talk in private? I have something to tell you,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Come with me.” Feng Qiuyan quickly took the two of them to a small building. Then, he looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Coach, tell me directly.”</p>
<p>“Qin Ling isn’t human. She has half the bloodline of a dimensional creature,” Zhou Wen said directly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter967'>Chapter 967: Seven Seas Dragon King</h3>
<p>“Little Yanyan, you don’t have to be sad. Actually…” Li Xuan wanted to comfort Feng Qiuyan, but Feng Qiuyan didn’t show an expression that needed his comfort.</p>
<p>“What’s the other half of her bloodline?” Feng Qiuyan asked calmly.</p>
<p>“Sea God Reef’s Golden Dragon King bloodline,” Zhou Wen answered Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>“I see. My memories back then were indeed correct. I saw strange horns growing from her head and scales appearing on her body,” Feng Qiuyan muttered to himself.</p>
<p>“When I returned, I met Qin Ling. She told me to tell you that she has gone to Sea God Reef and will never return again.” Zhou Wen conveyed Qin Ling’s words to Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>“That’s good too.” Feng Qiuyan nodded slightly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen then told Feng Qiuyan the full story about the Seven Seas Dragon King.</p>
<p>“What’s that Seven Seas Dragon King? I don’t care if it hoards the monsters in the sea, but it actually wants to target a human beauty. Damn it, I can’t tolerate it. Old Zhou, count me in if you want to take down that Seven Seas Dragon King,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>However, Feng Qiuyan didn’t say a word. He turned around and left the building, but he didn’t leave the Feng family residence.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, Little Yanyan suffered quite a heavy blow,” Li Xuan said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“People have to suffer some blows to grow. It’s not a bad thing,” Zhou Wen said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“I’m just afraid the blow is too great.” Li Xuan shook his head slightly.</p>
<p>“Don’t be sentimental here. Aren’t you going to kill the Seven Seas Dragon King? What are you waiting for? Go and prepare. We are about to set off,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Are we really going?” Li Xuan asked with widened eyes.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that you couldn’t tolerate it?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“I was just responding to the mood back then. That’s an old Terror-grade monster. Didn’t you say that only a Terror-grade can kill a Terror-grade. The two of us aren’t at the Terror-grade. Wouldn’t we be sending ourselves to our deaths if we went?” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Enough, we’re just going to deal with the other ordinary dragon monarchs. We aren’t going to kill the Seven Seas Dragon King.” Zhou Wen rolled his eyes at him.</p>
<p>The two of them left the Feng family residence and headed for the seaside again. When they arrived at the seaside, Li Xuan looked back and couldn’t help but feel slightly disappointed when he didn’t see Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.” In an area without anyone else, Zhou Wen summoned Deep Blue Crab Sovereign and got Li Xuan to sit with him.</p>
<p>A gravity bubble appeared around the Deep Blue Crab Sovereign’s body. A hemispherical bubble was hooked onto its back, protecting Zhou Wen and company, preventing them from being hit by the seawater.</p>
<p>The Deep Blue Crab Sovereign wasn’t slow at all. It moved in water as though it was flying. Furthermore, it didn’t walk horizontally. It walked forward normally like a spider.</p>
<p>The first dimensional zone Zhou Wen planned on heading to was known as Undersea Blue Hole to humans. The sea surface appeared to be an extraordinary blue color. It was very different from the surrounding seawater, as though it was a blue hole.</p>
<p>In fact, the seawater there was the same color as the surrounding seawater. The difference was that there was a bottomless cave at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>As it was underwater and it was very difficult for humans to fight underwater for long periods of time, very few humans entered the Undersea Blue Hole.</p>
<p>According to Miya’s intelligence, there was a huge sea snake in the Undersea Blue Hole dimensional zone. The sea snake was extremely poisonous. As it had a sliver of a dragon’s bloodline, it also claimed to be a Sea Dragon King.</p>
<p>In the Undersea Blue Hole, there were a large number of poisonous sea snakes. The toxicity of these sea snakes was very intense. Once someone’s body was injured, the snake venom would enter their bodies through their wounds. It was doubtful many humans could withstand it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Poison stat was very high. Furthermore, he cultivated a Poison-type Essence Energy Skill, so he wasn’t afraid of poison.</p>
<p>Li Xuan had an indestructible body and with the carapace that had fused with Alpha, he probably could shrug off ordinary sea snakes. He only needed to be careful against the Sea Dragon King.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had already learned of the Sea Dragon King’s weakness from Miya. He had brought Li Xuan here because he wanted to use his strength to safely finish off the Sea Dragon King.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen could handle it himself, it was relatively more troublesome without help. After all, reality wasn’t a game. Zhou Wen didn’t wish for any accidents to happen.</p>
<p>“In a while, after we enter the Undersea Blue Hole, leave the ordinary sea snakes to me. You don’t have to worry. When the Sea Dragon King comes out, I’ll hold it back. Then, you can release the Ice Silkworm and use it to lower its temperature.” Zhou Wen explained his plan to Li Xuan.</p>
<p>The Sea Dragon King didn’t have any natural enemies in the water. The only thing it was afraid of was the cold. If the temperature was too low, its body would turn stiff.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have any Mythical ice-type pets, so he could only rely on Li Xuan’s Ice Silkworm.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the entrance of the Undersea Blue Hole, Zhou Wen looked around and couldn’t help but feel disappointed when he didn’t find the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>Quite a number of sea snakes had already appeared near the blue hole. These sea snakes looked rather odd. Their bodies were flat and looked similar to fish, but they were more than ten meters long.</p>
<p>Furthermore, their bodies were blue in color. It was difficult to discover them when they melded into the environment.</p>
<p>When the sea snakes approached, there was no need for Zhou Wen to do anything. The Crab Sovereign brandished its crab pincers and snipped the sea snakes into two. No sea snakes could approach them.</p>
<p>After entering the blue hole, a large number of sea snakes appeared in Zhou Wen and company’s line of sight. They watched as countless sea snakes twisted and squirmed in the seawater. The scene left them shuddering.</p>
<p>Crab Sovereign spewed out a large number of gravity bubbles. The moment the sea snakes encountered the gravity bubbles, they were sucked into them. Then, as though gravity had lost its effect on them, they floated in the bubbles, unable to rush out.</p>
<p>There were many sea snakes, but there were even more gravity bubbles. A large number of sea snakes were trapped by the gravity bubbles, unable to rush over.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a blue-scaled, nearly hundred-meter-long, strange sea snake with a horn on its head rushed out from the depths of the blue hole. Its eyes were filled with anger as it stared coldly and sinisterly at the Crab Sovereign.</p>
<p>“How ugly. That Seven Seas Dragon King sure is hardcore. To think that he can even lay his hands on a harem of this quality.” Li Xuan couldn’t help but criticize when he saw the Sea Dragon King’s appearance.</p>
<p>“They are dragons. They have different standards of beauty from us.” Zhou Wen watched the Sea Dragon King rush over and wasn’t in a rush to attack. All he did was order the Crab Sovereign to continue spewing out the gravity bubbles.</p>
<p>“Thankfully, Qin Ling isn’t this fellow’s sister,” Li Xuan said with a strange expression.</p>
<p>The Sea Dragon King was unbridled as his body tore through the gravity bubble. He opened his terrifying snake mouth and was about to swallow both the humans and crab.</p>
<p>The Crab Sovereign exerted all its strength as it raised its pincers and clamp down on its jawbone. However, the Sea Dragon King’s strength was just too great. It forcefully pressed down the Crab Sovereign’s pincers. The latter was no match for the Sea Dragon King.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned Sword Pill which transformed into a stream of light that stabbed at the Sea Dragon King’s eyes. At the same time, he signaled Li Xuan with his eyes.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Li Xuan summoned the two Ice Silkworms. While the Sea Dragon King was distracted by the Sword Pill, the male and female Ice Silkworms landed on the Sea Dragon King’s body from both sides and attached to it like leeches.</p>
<h3 id='chapter968'>Chapter 968: Unexpected Gain</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The two Ice Silkworms stuck to the Sea Dragon King’s body. The Sea Dragon King immediately shivered and his actions became unnatural as he struggled to get the Ice Silkworms off him.</p>
<p>However, the Crab Sovereign held onto its head tightly. The Sea Dragon King was momentarily unable to escape, so its body became increasingly stiff.</p>
<p>What powerful Ice Silkworms. Zhou Wen could see with his naked eye that frost was spreading on the Sea Dragon King’s scales. The Sea Dragon King’s body was turning stiffer.</p>
<p>Before long, the gigantic Sea Dragon King lost its combat ability. It was as though it was in hibernation as its body froze.</p>
<p>Indeed, it’s better to have a restraining effect when killing monsters. Zhou Wen didn’t even need to attack. As the Sea Dragon King couldn’t retaliate, the Crab Sovereign finished it off.</p>
<p>The two Ice Silkworms were still stuck to the Sea Snake King’s body. The blood in the Sea Snake King’s body had already frozen. After a while, the Crab Sovereign’s two giant pincers finally split the Sea Snake King’s body into two, but he only found a stat crystal.</p>
<p>“How stingy. He didn’t even drop a Companion Egg,” Li Xuan said gloomily.</p>
<p>“How can Companion Eggs drop so easily?” Zhou Wen was already used to it. After putting away the stat crystal, he glanced at the bottomless blue hole and thought for a moment. “Since we’re here, let’s go down and take a look.”</p>
<p>The Crab Sovereign led the three of them deeper into the blue hole. There were many sea snakes around, but with the Crab Emperor’s gravity bubble opening up a path for them, no sea snake could approach them.</p>
<p>“This blue hole is so deep. I’m afraid it’s about to reach the other side of Earth.” After diving for a while, the Crab Sovereign still failed to reach the bottom of the blue hole.</p>
<p>The blue hole seemed bottomless. They had dived so deep that even the sea snakes didn’t appear again.</p>
<p>Most of the sea snakes lived in snake caves on the rock walls, but at this depth, even the snake caves couldn’t be seen.</p>
<p>“There seems to be something down there?” Li Xuan leaned on the Crab Sovereign and looked down as though he had seen something.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also looked over and indeed, he saw a swath of crystalline jade-blue below, as though the crystal cave was glowing.</p>
<p>However, even crystals needed light to show any reflection. It was naturally impossible for light to exist in such a deep sea. The glowing crystals were definitely extraordinary.</p>
<p>As the Crab Sovereign dived deeper, the blue light gradually became clearer. Only then did the two realize that it was a thick glacier.</p>
<p>“That’s strange. Isn’t the Sea Dragon King afraid of the cold? Why would it live in such a cold place?” Li Xuan asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“There must be a reason. Perhaps the secret is in the glacier. The ice definitely wouldn’t glow by itself. There might be something inside,” Zhou Wen said as he sized up the glacier.</p>
<p>“Could it be a snake egg produced by the Sea Dragon King? If it’s a snake egg, perhaps I can tame it like a Gu.” Li Xuan reached his hand into the water and touched the glacier. He was immediately given a fright. The glacier was extremely cold. Just touching it nearly froze his fingers.</p>
<p>“The Sea Dragon King is so afraid of the cold, so how can it lay its eggs here? At such a low temperature, I don’t think the Sea Dragon King would dare approach because of the cold, right?” Zhou Wen ordered the Crab Sovereign to dig the ice.</p>
<p>The Crab Sovereign was very resistant to cold. Under Zhou Wen’s orders, it brandished its huge crab pincers and quickly cracked open the glacier.</p>
<p>More and more ice blocks were dug out as Zhou Wen and company finally saw what was glowing with blue light.</p>
<p>“Is that a tooth? The Sea Dragon King’s tooth?” The thing that emitted blue light from the glacier was a meter-long blue tooth that looked like it was carved from ice.</p>
<p>“It’s obviously not.” Zhou Wen got the Crab Sovereign to grab the tooth. After grabbing it, he immediately felt a chill from the tooth. Almost instantly, Zhou Wen’s hands froze.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly threw the tooth onto the Crab Sovereign’s back and couldn’t help but be alarmed. With his physical strength and Essence Energy, ice immediately formed on him. The coldness emitted from the tooth was no less than a strike from a Mythical creature.</p>
<p>“Could this thing be…” Zhou Wen thought of a possibility.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“Typical dimensional creatures, even Mythical creatures, will rot and disintegrate after death. Only a very small number of corpses can be stored for a long period of time, but it’s impossible for them to maintain the strength back when they were alive—unless it’s the corpse of a Terror-grade creature. A body in its Terror form can preserve Terror-grade power. It won’t rot and disintegrate so easily,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“In that case, this is a tooth of a Terror form? What kind of creature is it? It can’t be the Seven Seas Dragon King’s, right?” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the tooth and said, “It’s not impossible. The Sea Dragon King is clearly afraid of the cold, but there’s such a tooth here. I think it’s unlikely that the Sea Dragon King placed it here. Perhaps the Seven Seas Dragon King placed it here to suppress it.”</p>
<p>“Who cares who placed it? Since it’s good stuff, let’s take it. What do you think this thing is for? Can it be made into a weapon?” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I don’t know much about the Terror grade. I just heard that it is the true Mythical stage. Perhaps the materials obtained from a Terror-grade creature are useful.” Zhou Wen put on the Dragon Scale Armor and forcefully threw the ice-blue tooth into the Chaos Bead.</p>
<p>Although it only took a short period of time, the dragon scales on his hands had produced a layer of frost.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>He got Crab Sovereign to dig deeper into the glacier, but it didn’t find anything. This wasn’t unexpected because other than the tooth, there was no more glow in the glacier.</p>
<p>Seeing that there was nothing else in the blue hole, Zhou Wen ordered Crab Sovereign to lead them out.</p>
<p>“Where are we going next?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“Let’s go to Evil Dragon Island. I heard from Miya that there’s a dragon monarch that looks like a crocodile there. Its defense and combat strength are extremely shocking. Furthermore, it’s not afraid of the cold. The Ice Silkworm will be useless this time, but I’ve already thought of a way to kill it. It shouldn’t be difficult,” Zhou Wen said as he ordered Crab Sovereign to head towards Evil Dragon Island.</p>
<p>No human dared to approach such an island. Even the great devils overseas wouldn’t casually enter such a place.</p>
<p>Using Miya’s information, Zhou Wen and company easily found Evil Dragon Island and Dragon King.</p>
<p>It indeed looked like a crocodile, but it wasn’t completely like a crocodile. Its body was much longer than a crocodile, and it had horns on its head. It could barely be considered a dragon.</p>
<p>Miya had explained that the dragon was afraid of poison. Zhou Wen secretly used the Invisibility Cloak and stabbed it in the eye. When it opened its mouth in pain, he threw the poisonous hair formed from Fatal Temptation into its mouth.</p>
<p>Soon, the Evil Dragon died. There was nothing there when they tore open its corpse.</p>
<p>“This fellow is even stingier than the previous one,” Li Xuan said as his eyes suddenly lit up. “Old Zhou, do you think there’s a tooth here?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter969'>Chapter 969: The Remnants of Terror Creatures</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“No way?” Zhou Wen found it unlikely.</p>
<p>“Let’s search. Who knows?” Li Xuan began searching the dragon’s lair.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally thought that there was no hope, but to his surprise, Li Xuan found something.</p>
<p>“There really is one. Look here. There’s also the same ice as the bottom of the blue cave.” Li Xuan’s voice sounded from inside the dragon lair.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen went over to take a look and indeed, he realized that there was a thick layer of ice in the stone cave. There was an ice-blue glow inside.</p>
<p>“That does seem to be the case.” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised as he got Crab Sovereign to dig up the ice layer. At the same time, he said, “If there’s also the same tooth here, it means this matter won’t be that simple.”</p>
<p>Li Xuan nodded. “The Sea Dragon King is afraid of the cold, so it’s possible that the tooth was put there to suppress it, but this Evil Dragon isn’t afraid of the cold. There’s no reason to put one here.”</p>
<p>With that said, Li Xuan’s eyes suddenly lit up. “By the way, didn’t you say that the seven dragon monarchs are the concubines of the Seven Seas Dragon King? Do you think this tooth is a token the Seven Seas Dragon King gave to his concubines? Something similar to the tooth having the same authority and presence as the dragon?”</p>
<p>“How would I know? Let’s wait until we dig it out.” Zhou Wen shook his head helplessly.</p>
<p>Soon, the Crab Sovereign dug out something else. It wasn’t the tooth they had imagined. Instead, it was a bone that looked like a rib. However, it had a broken section. It didn’t look complete.</p>
<p>Although it was a bone, it was similar to the tooth. They were both ice-blue and crystalline. It was obvious that they originated from the same creature.</p>
<p>“The Seven Seas Dragon King probably wouldn’t remove his rib to use as a love token, right?” Zhou Wen said as he looked at the rib.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, the tooth and rib are unlikely to belong to the Seven Seas Dragon King. However, apart from the Seven Seas Dragon King, are there any other Terror-grade creatures in the Seven Seas? Why are the things from its body in the two dragon monarchs’ nests?” Li Xuan stroked his chin in thought.</p>
<p>“We can go to the other dragon monarchs to take a look. Perhaps there’s something similar in their lairs. If that’s the case, it will really be interesting,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Why?” Li Xuan asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“I heard that deities were born because of humanity’s fear. Therefore, as long as human fear remains, deities are immortal existences that will never die. That’s also the origins for the Terror grade.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen paused for a moment before continuing, “I don’t know if the legend is real or fake, but from the looks of it, there’s still a terrifying Terror form power on the tooth and bone. If we can really find all its bones, do you think it will suddenly revive?”</p>
<p>“Don’t scare me. If we ended up killed after going through great trouble to find the bones and teeth, wouldn’t that make us look stupid?” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“If there really are more parts in the other dragon monarchs’ lairs, do you think we should dig them up or not?” Zhou Wen asked Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“We dig. Of course we have to dig. These Terror form teeth and bones must be extremely high in value. If every dragon monarch has some Terror form item, we just won’t dig them all out. I often see on television that those devils who want to revive need to find their bodies. As long as their bodies aren’t complete, they can’t be revived,” Li Xuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>“That makes sense.” Zhou Wen didn’t care. At most, he would put them all into the chaos space.</p>
<p>Even if the owner of the teeth and bones really revived, they wouldn’t be able to cause any trouble in the chaos space.</p>
<p>If something major really happened, Zhou Wen could get the owner of the bones to meet the ice maiden who was trapped in the Chaos Bead and let them fight to the death.</p>
<p>Therefore, the two of them went to another few dimensional zones and avoided some terrifying taboos along the way. Soon, the two of them killed two more dragon monarchs. In the end, they really found something similar at the two dragon monarchs’ lairs.</p>
<p>They found a crystal-like strand of hair in one lair and a broken horn in another. They were also cold and crystalline. It likely originated from the same creature as the tooth and bone from before.</p>
<p>“Why do I feel like we are villain minions trying to revive a demon king?” Li Xuan said with an odd expression.</p>
<p>“How can we be villains? When villains revive a demon king, they have righteous protagonists who try their best to stop them. How can there be villains as successful as us?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>“That’s true.” Li Xuan thought for a moment and asked, “Where are we going next?”</p>
<p>“The closest dimensional zone is the Deathwater Zone. It will be troublesome there. The seawater in the Deathwater Zone is affected by the dimensional zone. Any creature that enters will sink. Even if they can fly, it’s useless inside. All they can do is constantly sink. To kill the lobster-like dragon monarch inside, the greatest obstacle is the Deathwater Zone itself,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You are good at this. Ya’er and I will wait for you outside,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>When they arrived near the Deathwater Zone, Zhou Wen got Crab Sovereign to stay outside to protect Li Xuan and Ya’er while he put on his Invisibility Cloak and entered the Deathwater Zone.</p>
<p>With the protection of the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, the Deathwater Zone prevented Zhou Wen from drowning. At the same time, Zhou Wen used Grand Turtle Breath to restrain his vitality.</p>
<p>The lobster-like dragon monarch was blind. It could only rely on vital aura to determine the location of other creatures. Zhou Wen’s Grand Turtle Breath could restrain it.</p>
<p>Not only was the water in the Deathwater Zone not black, but it was crystalline, like pure water without any impurities.</p>
<p>There were no dimensional creatures in the water. Apart from the dragon monarch, ordinary dimensional creatures didn’t have the ability to swim in the Deathwater Zone. They were all at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>Ordinary people would quickly sink into the Deathwater Zone and be eaten by them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally didn’t have any qualms. He quickly swam through the Deathwater Zone and easily passed through it under the cover of the Invisibility Cloak and Grand Turtle Breath to find the dragon monarch.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be surprised when he saw the dragon monarch. The dragon monarch was much more beautiful than he had imagined.</p>
<p>Although it looked like a lobster, its carapace was crystalline, revealing a mysterious sapphire color. There were countless shimmering streams of light inside.</p>
<p>When it stood still, it was like a sapphire art piece that was illuminated by starlight.</p>
<p>“Miya said that its carapace isn’t only beautiful, but it’s also hard. If I want to kill it, I have to attack from the inside.” Zhou Wen turned invisible and approached the huge lobster. At the same time, he summoned the Ancient Splitting Tadpole and stuffed it into its mouth in the form of a grenade.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>As the Ancient Splitting Tadpole kept exploding, the lobster’s body kept tumbling. Pieces of flesh spat out from its mouth, but its carapace remained intact.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>With the lobster’s death, a Companion Egg dropped.</p>
<h3 id='chapter970'>Chapter 970: Galaxy Shell Dragon</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>A Companion Egg has finally dropped! Zhou Wen was delighted as he hurriedly picked it up. Then, he used the mysterious phone to read its information.</p>
<p>Galaxy Shell Dragon: Mythical</p>
<p>Life Providence: Unbreakable</p>
<p>Life Soul: Astral Array</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Absolute Defense</p>
<p>Strength: 80</p>
<p>Speed: 80</p>
<p>Constitution: 81</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 80</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Deathwater Domain, Dragon Head Raising, Ghost Armor</p>
<p>Companion Form: Armor</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>One attribute is actually 81! Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. Unless it was some excellent-grade Mythical Companion Beast, it was impossible for it to have a stat reach 81 points.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Shell Dragon actually had one stat reach 81. This meant that it had broken through its limits in a particular aspect. It was considered an excellent-grade Mythical Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at its stats and abilities and was very curious about the Absolute Defense ability. He had previously seen Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength amongst the Absolute series for Wheels of Destiny.</p>
<p>The Wheel of Destiny of the Galaxy Shell Dragon was very similar to Tyrant Behemoth’s. It was unknown if it had the same level of might.</p>
<p>There was nothing else to say. It looked like a defensive Companion Beast. Now that Zhou Wen had Dragon Scale Armor, he didn’t have much need for defensive Mythical Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen still hatched it and summoned it in its armor form. He wanted to see if this pure defensive Companion Beast armor had higher defense.</p>
<p>When the armor appeared on Zhou Wen, he couldn’t help but be surprised.</p>
<p>A translucent blue armor that shimmered with nebulous starlight appeared on Zhou Wen’s body, tightly enveloping him. It accentuated his slender and muscular figure, making him look like a god surrounded by starlight.</p>
<p>Ignoring its defense, just the appearance of the armor is far better than the Dragon Scale Armor. Zhou Wen still remembered about the Terror creature’s material, so he searched the vicinity while wearing the armor.</p>
<p>The dimensional creatures at the bottom of the sea rushed forward. Zhou Wen wanted to test the strength of the armor, so he didn’t fight back and allowed them to attack.</p>
<p>The ordinary dimensional creatures couldn’t injure the armor at all.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I have to fight a Mythical creature to know how strong this armor’s defense is. Zhou Wen searched the vicinity for a while and indeed found the ice block.</p>
<p>After digging open the ice, he discovered a damaged scale. Like the materials from before, it was extremely cold. Zhou Wen stored it in the chaos space.</p>
<p>After leaving the Deathwater Zone, Li Xuan and Ya’er were still waiting for him outside. The three of them continued on their journey.</p>
<p>“I found another scale. All the dragon monarchs have the same material. I’m wondering if Miya has something like that,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Tooth, bone, hair, horn, and scale. The more I look at it, the more it looks like we are preparing to revive a divine dragon. When we gather the other two materials, can we summon a divine dragon and make a wish?” Li Xuan teased.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>“There’s still the last dragon monarch. After we deal with this dragon monarch, we’ll go to Miya and ask her. She might know what these things are for.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Zhou Wen continued, “However, this dragon monarch is a little troublesome. She seems to be a mixed-blood with clam and dragon heritage. She’s known as a Dragon Granny, but she’s actually a clam lady with some dragon blood. However, her abilities are somewhat special. She can suck people into shells and trap them until they die. Furthermore, I heard that the Seven Seas Dragon King often lives with her. I’m afraid that we’ll encounter the Seven Seas Dragon King when we head there. It will be troublesome when that happens.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Then what should we do?” Li Xuan also knew that this wasn’t a joke. If they really encountered a Terror-grade Seven Seas Dragon King, they would die.</p>
<p>“Infinite Island where Dragon Granny lives is relatively close to the coast. Let’s head back now. Later, I’ll secretly sneak up to Infinite Island and take a look at the situation first.” Zhou Wen didn’t dare be careless.</p>
<p>“That’s the only way.” Li Xuan nodded as the three of them returned to the beach.</p>
<p>“Since we have to return, why don’t we go to Miya’s place and ask her what these materials are for?” Li Xuan was curious and couldn’t help himself.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen didn’t think that it would waste much time, so they took a detour to Sea God Reef.</p>
<p>This was the first time Li Xuan had seen the shrimp soldiers and crab generals. He felt very curious and said in puzzlement, “That’s strange. Why does Miya’s place look like the only place that resembles what a real dragon monarch should have? The other dragon monarchs are just a haphazard mob. They don’t look like something a dragon monarch should have. There aren’t even shrimp soldiers and crab generals.”</p>
<p>“I find it odd too. Perhaps Miya’s bloodline is really different. She’s indeed the creature that looks most like a dragon among the seven dragon monarchs,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>When the two arrived at the beach, the shrimp soldiers and crab generals took them to the Dragon Palace.</p>
<p>In the Dragon Palace, not only did he see Miya, but he also saw Qin Ling standing beside her.</p>
<p>Li Xuan secretly observed and didn’t see Feng Qiuyan, so he didn’t mention the matter again. All he did was greet Qin Ling.</p>
<p>“Why are you back so quickly? Did you encounter trouble?” Miya didn’t mention Qin Ling and only asked Zhou Wen in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“We’ve already eliminated five dragon monarchs. Now, only Dragon Granny remains. We didn’t rashly head over because we were afraid of encountering the Seven Seas Dragon King at Dragon Granny’s place,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You actually killed the Galaxy Shell Dragon and the rest so quickly?” Miya looked at Zhou Wen in disbelief.</p>
<p>“I did. Furthermore, I discovered something strange at the Sea Dragon King’s place, so I wanted to ask you if you know what it is.” Zhou Wen took out the tooth and placed it on the ground.</p>
<p>The ground in the cabin immediately froze. Furthermore, the frost was rapidly spreading throughout the cabin. The coldness in the tooth was too intense.</p>
<p>“This is… Dragon King’s Tooth?” Miya sized it up for a while before her expression gradually changed into surprise.</p>
<p>“Are you saying that this is the tooth of the Seven Seas Dragon King?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Miya shook her head. “It’s not from the Seven Seas Dragon King. I heard that there was a true dragon in the Seven Dragons Sea to begin with. After the Seven Seas Dragon King came, he killed that true dragon and became ruler of the Seven Dragons Sea. However, these are only legends. I didn’t believe it at first, but now that I see this tooth, I believe it a little. This is clearly a dragon’s tooth after its Terror transformation. Otherwise, it would be impossible for it to be preserved. In the entire Seven Dragons Sea, other than the Seven Seas Dragon King, only a legendary true dragon can reach the Terror grade. Furthermore, according to legend, it’s an ice-elemental true dragon.”</p>
<p>“I see.” Zhou Wen looked at Miya and asked, “We discovered some items at the other dragon monarchs’ lairs. Don’t tell me you have something from the true dragon?”</p>
<p>Miya shook her head and said, “Perhaps, but I’ve never seen it before. The Dragon Palace in Sea God Reef wasn’t here originally. During the battle between my father and the Seven Seas Dragon King, the original Dragon Palace was destroyed, so I moved here. If you are interested, I can take you to the original Dragon Palace.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter971'>Chapter 971: Seven Seas Dragon King Appears</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The original Dragon Palace was now in ruins. There were broken coral reefs everywhere.</p>
<p>According to Miya, the original Dragon Palace was a coral palace, but there was no longer anything left. All that was left was ruins.</p>
<p>Miya didn’t wish to live in this sad place, so she stayed in the sunken ship.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen got the Crab Sovereign to dig up the coral reefs to search for the possible ice block. He never expected to find it, but beneath a coral reef rock, a blue ice block appeared.</p>
<p>After digging it open, he found a blue crystal that looked like an eyeball. Miya said that it might be the Dragon King’s dragon eye.</p>
<p>As Miya didn’t know what these things were for, Zhou Wen had no choice but to put them away. He had a nagging feeling that they would be of some use.</p>
<p>After leaving Sea God Reef, Li Xuan felt that something was amiss the more he thought about it. “Old Zhou, I think something’s amiss.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“If that Terror-grade true dragon was really killed by the Seven Seas Dragon King, why would the Terror objects on its body be hidden in the seven dragon monarchs’ lairs? Even if the Seven Seas Dragon King doesn’t need these materials, there’s no need for him to go through so much trouble to hide them in seven different places, right?” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“It’s indeed a little strange. Perhaps the seven dragon monarchs also participated in the battle. These Terror items might be a reward from the Seven Seas Dragon King.” Zhou Wen had also thought of this problem.</p>
<p>“How can these fellows help in a battle at the Terror grade?” Li Xuan pondered for a moment before his eyes suddenly lit up. “Do you think the seven dragon monarchs were subordinates of that ice-elemental dragon to begin with? In the end, they betrayed the ice-elemental dragon and pledged allegiance to the Seven Seas Dragon King. That’s why they obtained these Terror items as rewards?”</p>
<p>“Possibly.” Zhou Wen felt that it was indeed possible.</p>
<p>“I still feel that something is amiss.” Li Xuan continued pondering with a frown.</p>
<p>After returning to Sea Return City, Zhou Wen got Ya’er to temporarily follow Li Xuan. He planned on visiting Infinite Island. If the Seven Seas Dragon King wasn’t there, he could take the opportunity to kill Dragon Granny.</p>
<p>However, before he went, Zhou Wen sent a message to The Thearch to ask if the Terror-grade materials were of any use.</p>
<p>“Where did you get the Terror items?” The Thearch quickly replied.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen roughly explained the matter regarding the Seven Dragons Sea before asking The Thearch: “If we find all the Terror items, will this Terror creature revive?”</p>
<p>“How can it be that easy to revive one. However, those Terror items are considered pretty good materials due to the existence of the power of fear. It’s useless for you to keep them anyway. Why don’t you let me experiment with them?” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>“How is it useless? I still plan on turning these materials into weapons. Weapons made from Terror items should be very powerful, right?” Zhou Wen hurriedly replied.</p>
<p>“Do you think that’s scrap metal? That it can be made into a weapon just by smelting and refining them? Different Terror items have different uses. As you said, those are ice-elemental Terror items. It’s best used to make a refrigerator to store experimental items at low temperatures,” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if The Thearch was telling the truth or not. In any case, he definitely wasn’t willing to use the Terror items to build a refrigerator.</p>
<p>After chatting with The Thearch for a while, he didn’t obtain any useful information. Just as Zhou Wen was about to head to Infinite Island, he suddenly saw a violent gust of wind on the surface of the sea. The waves transformed into a huge tsunami that surged towards the coast. Large numbers of dimensional creatures rushed onto land with the tsunami.</p>
<p>Another dimensional creature tide? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>This dimensional creature tide was much more terrifying than the previous crab tide. Many dimensional creatures in the water found it difficult to unleash their combat strength on land.</p>
<p>However, this time, the seawater expanded and rushed towards the land. Many marine creatures that couldn’t enter the land were also swept forward.</p>
<p>Could it be that the Seven Seas Dragon King wants revenge after discovering that the five dragon monarchs are dead? Zhou Wen was secretly alarmed.</p>
<p>Sea Return City was the first to bear the brunt of the attack. The terrifying tsunami even crossed the high wall and poured into Sea Return City. Shark-like dimensional creatures could be seen charging through the city with the waves.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the people who remained in Sea Return City were all wealthy families. There were no longer any commoners. Most of them had a certain level of combat strength, so they didn’t suffer too much damage.</p>
<p>However, as the tsunami continued to inundate the city, more and more marine dimensional creatures swept forward. The situation was extremely bad.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he hadn’t discovered any Mythical creatures. Zhou Wen estimated that he had killed most of the Mythical creatures in the Seven Dragons Sea. There weren’t many Mythical creatures left.</p>
<p>After putting on the Invisibility Cloak, Zhou Wen flew towards the sea, hoping to see what power had triggered the tsunami. Ordinary Mythical creatures definitely couldn’t produce such a tsunami. Zhou Wen guessed that the Seven Seas Dragon King had personally arrived.</p>
<p>Flying far into the air, Zhou Wen didn’t dare approach the sea. If the Seven Seas Dragon King was really here, he would still have room to escape.</p>
<p>The tsunami came wave after wave. Soon, Zhou Wen saw the source of the tsunami. He saw huge strange dragons stirring up trouble in the sea.</p>
<p>The reason they were called strange dragons was that although they looked like dragons, they weren’t completely dragons.</p>
<p>They did have dragon faces, but there were no scales on their bodies. Instead, they had smooth skin that looked extremely tight.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen didn’t see any dragon claws on them. Instead of calling them dragons, they looked more like snakes, but they didn’t look like snakes either. There was a strange ring on their abdomen.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it’s the Seven Seas Dragon King. Zhou Wen counted and indeed, there were seven of them. However, their tails were beneath the sea, so he couldn’t tell what they looked like.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was sizing up the Seven Seas Dragon King, the Seven Seas Dragon King seemed to notice Zhou Wen in midair. The strange dragons raised their heads and looked at the invisible Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>I’ve been discovered! Zhou Wen was alarmed as he saw the seven strange dragons spew out white liquid at him.</p>
<p>The liquid was clearly not ordinary water. It was probably the mucus that Miya mentioned. Once touched, he would be stuck and rendered immobile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen quickly dodged without touching the white liquid. The Seven Seas Dragon King was enraged when he saw this. His body rose out of the water as though he wanted to rush out of the sea to attack Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>As the Seven Seas Dragon King’s body rose up, the seawater surged to the sides. Zhou Wen finally saw the lower half of the Seven Seas Dragon King and his expression turned odd.</p>
<h3 id='chapter972'>Chapter 972: Mysterious Person</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>How was that a dragon? It was a huge octopus monster. The seven strange dragons were its seven tentacles.</p>
<p>However, it was different from ordinary octopuses. Its tentacles had a dragon head growing at the tip, as well as eyes, ears, tongue, and nose. It looked both like an octopus and a dragon. It looked extremely strange and evil.</p>
<p>The enraged Seven Seas Dragon King revealed most of its body. Its strange dragon-like tentacles spewed out white liquid into the air, hoping to strike Zhou Wen down.</p>
<p>Although it was very fast, Zhou Wen wasn’t slow either. Furthermore, he was very far from the sea, preventing the Seven Seas Dragon King from touching him.</p>
<p>Realizing that he couldn’t hit Zhou Wen, the Seven Seas Dragon King suddenly stopped and retracted his seven tentacles.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw the Seven Seas Dragon King’s pose, he found it baffling. Its current appearance was like a sitting Buddha. Its seven tentacles curved into a motionless pose, like a Buddha’s hand that was forming seals.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could even vaguely hear the chanting of scriptures coming from the Seven Seas Dragon King.</p>
<p>With the strange chanting, the Seven Seas Dragon King’s entire body seemed to fall into a fog, preventing others from seeing clearly.</p>
<p>Not good! Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. He wanted to escape, but it was too late.</p>
<p>Boundless fog rose around him as though the entire world was enveloped by fog. Furthermore, the chanting continued.</p>
<p>An illusion? A mental attack? Or is it some special power? Zhou Wen couldn’t be sure what power the Seven Seas Dragon King was using, but without a doubt, it was a power at the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used teleportation to teleport out of the fog, but just as he teleported out, he realized that not only was he unable to teleport out of the fog, but he ended up being delivered to right in front of the Seven Seas Dragon King. The Seven Seas Dragon King swallowed Zhou Wen who was beside its mouth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a terrifying suction force pull his body towards the Seven Seas Dragon King’s stomach.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to teleport again, but he realized that this place seemed to be a sealed space. He couldn’t teleport out.</p>
<p>Plop!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body fell into the white liquid. In an instant, the Dragon Scale Armor he wore was stuck to the white liquid. No matter how hard he struggled, he couldn’t escape. Soon, his entire body sank into the white liquid.</p>
<p>After the Seven Seas Dragon King devoured Zhou Wen, it sank into the sea in satisfaction and quickly vanished.</p>
<p>As the Seven Seas Dragon King vanished, the tsunami gradually subsided. The dimensional creatures that rushed to the coast gradually decreased.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen fell into the white liquid and used many methods, but he couldn’t escape no matter what. Furthermore, he realized that his Dragon Scale Armor was being assimilated by the white liquid. A portion of it had already turned into white liquid.</p>
<p>Even the Mythical Dragon Scale Armor couldn’t withstand the corrosion of the white liquid. Just the thought of the white liquid stuck to his flesh made him shudder.</p>
<p>What should I do? Should I release the ice maiden? Zhou Wen thought of this idea, but he didn’t immediately take action.</p>
<p>The ice maiden was a double-edged sword. Letting her out had pros and cons. If it wasn’t a last resort, Zhou Wen didn’t want to take that step.</p>
<p>He switched to a few more Essence Energy Arts, but they were useless. The Dragon Scale Armor was about to be penetrated.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the Chaos Egg with the intention of giving it a try.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t have much hope for the Chaos Egg. After all, even the Mythical Dragon Scale Armor couldn’t withstand the white liquid, while the Chaos Egg was only an Epic Life Soul.</p>
<p>However, to Zhou Wen’s surprise, when the Chaos Egg enveloped his body, the white liquid failed to corrode it like the Dragon Scale Armor.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief when he saw that the Chaos Egg could ward off the white liquid.</p>
<p>I never expected the Chaos Egg to be so magical. Although it doesn’t have any offensive power, its defense is rather good. Zhou Wen hid inside the Chaos Egg and used Truth Listener’s ability to pay attention to the commotion outside.</p>
<p>The Seven Seas Dragon King was advancing in the sea. From the direction it was heading in, it wasn’t Infinite Island where Dragon Granny was. He didn’t know where he was going.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg’s defense is impressive, but it can’t move and doesn’t have any offensive strength. How can I escape from here? Zhou Wen thought about it but couldn’t think of a good solution.</p>
<p>Not long after, the Seven Seas Dragon King stopped somewhere. Zhou Wen listened attentively and took in the situation outside. He realized that he was beside a huge rift at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, the Seven Seas Dragon King entered the underwater rift and entered a place that resembled an abyss.</p>
<p>In the abyss, Truth Listener’s ability couldn’t extend far. It could only hear the nearby situation. After a while, the Seven Seas Dragon King arrived in front of a palace.</p>
<p>This octopus sure knows how to enjoy itself. It actually has such a gorgeous palace in such a place, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen soon felt that something was amiss. When the Seven Seas Dragon King arrived in front of the palace, it made a strange gesture as though it was bowing.</p>
<p>“Come in.” A human voice sounded from the palace.</p>
<p>How can there be humans in such a place? It can’t be a human, right? Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>The Seven Seas Dragon King entered the palace. At the same time, Zhou Wen heard the situation inside. There was really a human inside.</p>
<p>The human wore black armor as he sat high on a throne, looking like an emperor.</p>
<p>After the Seven Seas Dragon King entered the palace, he prostrated himself as though he was expressing his humility to the human.</p>
<p>“Has it all been resolved?” the man asked casually.</p>
<p>The Seven Seas Dragon King couldn’t speak. All he could do was nod with all his might. Even the dragon heads at the tip of his tentacles nodded.</p>
<p>“That’s good. After spending so much time planning, I’ve finally created a mixed-blood Dracotaur. How can I let her escape my control?” the man said indifferently.</p>
<p>Who is this person? Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was very certain that the man was definitely a human and had likely contracted a Guardian. However, even so, it was unbelievable that an existence like the Seven Seas Dragon King would humbly serve him.</p>
<p>The Seven Seas Dragon King nodded repeatedly as though he agreed with the man.</p>
<p>The man didn’t seem willing to communicate with the Seven Seas Dragon King who couldn’t speak. He waved his hand and made the Seven Seas Dragon King retreat to the side. As for him, he sat there, fiddling with something in his hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be taken aback when he saw the item. It was a blue dragon pearl that resembled an ice crystal. It emitted a cold aura that was very similar to the Terror items he had previously obtained.</p>
<h3 id='chapter973'>Chapter 973: Dracotaur Bloodline</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>At this moment, a clam maiden walked into the palace and bowed to the man. “Master, everything is normal at Sea God Reef. Qin Ling has been residing in the sunken ship and hasn’t left.”</p>
<p>This is that Dragon Granny, right? Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>The man nodded slightly. “Watch her. I don’t want any more accidents.”</p>
<p>Dragon Granny glanced at the Seven Seas Dragon King and said in a seductive tone, “Master, that Zhou Wen is Wang Mingyuan’s disciple after all. If we kill him like this, I’m afraid it will be disadvantageous to your plan if Wang Mingyuan comes looking for trouble.”</p>
<p>The man said coldly, “So what if it’s Wang Mingyuan? He was nowhere when I dominated the Federation. Even if he was lucky and became the Dragon Gods’ lord, it was just a moment of luck. When my plan succeeds, the Dragon Gods’ lord will be nothing. Both humans and dragons will acknowledge me as their master.”</p>
<p>“How should we deal with Miya? If she hadn’t revealed the details of the other dragon monarchs, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have been able to kill them so easily,” Dragon Granny asked carefully.</p>
<p>“Qin Ling is still with her. Don’t worry about her for now. However, to prevent any problems from developing, we need to let Qin Ling mature as soon as possible and extract her Dracotaur bloodline.”</p>
<p>As the man spoke, he took out an item and threw it to Dragon Granny. He sneered and said, “Take this to the sunken ship and let Qin Ling eat it. In less than six months, her Dracotaur bloodline will be of use. When the time comes, all humans will be transformed into Dracotaurs. It’s useless even if the other Guardians win. Earth will forever be mine.”</p>
<p>“I’ll do it now.” Dragon Granny took the items and bowed before leaving the hall.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed when he heard that. This person is even more ruthless than Teacher and Jing Daoxian. Teacher only brought a portion of people into the dimension, while Jing Daoxian only experiments on talented people. This fellow actually wants to turn all humans into Dracotaurs. He’s too crazy. From his tone, he seems to be a high-ranking member of the Federation a long time ago. Who is he?</p>
<p>Upon realizing that Dragon Granny had already gone to Sea God Reef, Zhou Wen was somewhat anxious. However, he could only help himself now. He couldn’t even rush out of the Seven Seas Dragon King’s stomach, so it was even more impossible to inform Qin Ling.</p>
<p>“Go. Guard the Seven Dragons Sea well and don’t let any outsiders come into contact with Qin Ling.” The man waved his hand and gestured for the Seven Seas Dragon King to leave.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Inside Sea God Reef, Qin Ling was talking to Miya.</p>
<p>“Sister, how can you trust a human so easily?” Qin Ling said.</p>
<p>Miya sighed and said, “It was a moment of bewitchment. I actually believed that he could defeat the Seven Seas Dragon King. Now, not only is the Seven Seas Dragon King alive, but even his life has been lost. If I had known, I would have insisted that he take you away from the Seven Dragons Sea.”</p>
<p>However, Qin Ling shook her head and said, “I won’t leave with any human. I’m not a human to begin with.”</p>
<p>Miya reached out to rub Qin Ling’s head and sighed. “If it wasn’t for the Seven Seas Dragon King, you could have stayed here forever, but not now. I have to think of a way to send you out of the Seven Dragons Sea. You have human bloodline in you, so you still have a chance of breaking the dimensional zones’ restrictions.”</p>
<p>“So what if I leave? Won’t I still be treated like a monster?” Qin Ling was ashen.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan already knew the truth about her, but he hadn’t appeared again. Qin Ling had already given up.</p>
<p>“Little Feng probably hasn’t thought it through yet. Give him some more time,” Miya said helplessly.</p>
<p>In fact, Miya couldn’t understand Qin Ling’s feelings. As she was a pure dragon, she didn’t think that there was anything wrong with being a dragon.</p>
<p>However, Qin Ling had half a human bloodline. Furthermore, she had grown up in human society. The other half of the dragon bloodline gave her immense pressure other than strength.</p>
<p>As the two of them were talking, a shrimp soldier reported, “Master, Dragon Granny is here.”</p>
<p>“Why is she here?” Miya thought for a moment and said to Qin Ling, “Stay here and don’t come out. I’ll go and see what Dragon Granny is doing here.”</p>
<p>With that said, Miya left the cabin. After arriving on the deck, she saw Dragon Granny floating in the seawater outside.</p>
<p>“Dragon Granny, why are you here instead of Infinite Island?” Miya asked coldly.</p>
<p>“Several dragon monarchs in the Seven Dragons Sea have been killed. The Dragon King asked me to come and see if you had encountered any trouble here and to provide you help if necessary.” As Dragon Granny spoke, she had already passed through the water curtain and landed on the deck.</p>
<p>“I appreciate your kindness, but there’s no trouble here. You can return,” Miya said expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“Why are you in such a hurry to chase me away? I heard that your human sister has returned. Why don’t I see her?” Dragon Granny asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“She’s not feeling well and is resting. Please return.” Miya didn’t have a good impression of Dragon Granny.</p>
<p>“I’m good at Essence Energy recovery. I can help her. Take me to her,” said Dragon Granny.</p>
<p>“Don’t let me personally send you off.” Miya stared at Dragon Granny, her voice already turning cold.</p>
<p>“You can give it a try.” Dragon Granny was still smiling and wasn’t angry at all.</p>
<p>Miya didn’t stand on ceremony as she threw a punch at Dragon Granny.</p>
<p>Miya had inherited the Golden Dragon King’s bloodline and strength. The might of this punch was extremely powerful. Even Tyrant Behemoth was nothing against it.</p>
<p>However, Dragon Granny wasn’t flustered. She took out a small rattle drum from the clamshell and shook it gently.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Miya lost all her strength. A golden incantation appeared on her neck like a necklace, strangling her neck as if it was about to snap.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Miya revealed her Golden Dragon King body. The huge Golden Dragon Body rolled on the deck, but the golden incantation on her neck kept glowing. No matter how Miya struggled, she could not escape.</p>
<p>As the rattling of the rattle drum in Dragon Granny’s hand sped up, the incantation on Miya’s neck tightened. Miya was already paralyzed on the deck, her neck about to break.</p>
<p>“Sis, what’s wrong?” Qin Ling ran out and was shocked when she saw Miya. She wanted to help Miya remove the incantation on her neck.</p>
<p>However, just as her hand touched the incantation, it suddenly shrank, causing Miya extreme pain. However, she couldn’t make any sound. She was about to die.</p>
<p>The Turtle Minister rushed over with the shrimp soldiers and crab generals, but Dragon Granny only said indifferently, “If you want her to die, feel free to come.”</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Qin Ling stared at Dragon Granny and asked.</p>
<p>Dragon Granny opened the box in her hand and took out a crystal bottle inside. She handed it to Qin Ling. “Drink this and I’ll let her go.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” Qin Ling asked as she looked at the transparent liquid in the crystal bottle.</p>
<p>“Poison. A life for a life. Do you dare drink it?” Dragon Granny said with narrowed eyes.</p>
<h3 id='chapter974'>Chapter 974: Slaying Dragon Granny</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Will you let my sister off if I drink it?” Qin Ling said as she looked at the bottle in her hand.</p>
<p>“Qin Ling, throw it away,” Miya struggled to say.</p>
<p>Dragon Grandma shook the rattle drum again. Miya was immediately strangled to the point of not being able to make another sound. All she could do was tremble in pain on the ground.</p>
<p>“Of course. I always keep my word. Today, your sister offended me, so one of you has to die. Between you and your sister, choose who is to die.” Dragon Granny smiled at Qin Ling and said, “Of course, you can choose not to drink it. You can let your sister die. Anyway, she doesn’t share the same father as you and can’t be considered a real sister, right?”</p>
<p>“I’ll drink it. Let my sister go,” Qin Ling said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“It’s easy for me to kill you. There’s no need to lie to you. Once you drink it, I’ll immediately release your sister,” said Dragon Granny slowly.</p>
<p>Miya failed to make a sound. She struggled to get up and snatch the bottle from Qin Ling’s hand, but Dragon Granny shook the rattle drum, causing Miya to immediately collapse on the deck and tremble in pain.</p>
<p>Miya knew that someone must have done something to her. Otherwise, with the power of Dragon Granny, it was impossible for her to be her match, much less torture her so badly.</p>
<p>However, Miya couldn’t recall when anyone had done something to her.</p>
<p>“Stop shaking. I’ll drink it,” Qin Ling said as she opened the bottle and was about to drink the liquid inside.</p>
<p>“Don’t drink it!” With a clear voice, a saber beam slashed at Dragon Granny.</p>
<p>“Little Feng!” Qin Ling was pleasantly surprised when she saw the person.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan was expressionless as he slashed at Dragon Granny with his Life Soul Saber.</p>
<p>Dragon Granny’s figure moved as she dodged Feng Qiuyan’s saber force. She originally wanted to counterattack, but she realized that Feng Qiuyan’s saber aura was like a surging river. She couldn’t find any flaws.</p>
<p>“Your saber art isn’t bad, but unfortunately, you are too weak.” As Dragon Granny spoke, she used the clam shell to block Feng Qiuyan’s saber before striking his chest, sending him flying.</p>
<p>“Little Feng!” Qin Ling flew over to catch Feng Qiuyan who had flown back, only to see Feng Qiuyan’s chest collapse and blood seep from the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>“Sis Ling, I’m sorry I came late,” Feng Qiuyan said in his usual tone.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t have come.” Qin Ling checked Feng Qiuyan’s injuries with a complicated expression. “How are you?”</p>
<p>“He won’t die yet. I’m in a good mood today. I just want to kill someone. Qin Ling, who do you think I should kill?” Dragon Granny stared at Feng Qiuyan and said.</p>
<p>Qin Ling looked at Miya and Feng Qiuyan. She held the bottle and was about to raise it when Feng Qiuyan grabbed the bottle and threw it to the ground.</p>
<p>However, the bottle was crack resistant. It didn’t shatter, and the liquid inside didn’t spill at all.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan’s actions immediately infuriated Dragon Granny. She originally wanted to trick Qin Ling into drinking it, but now, she could only use force.</p>
<p>A strange aura rose from the Dragon Granny’s body as her eyes suffused a red glow. She stared at Feng Qiuyan and wanted to kill him first before forcefully injecting the liquid into Qin Ling’s body.</p>
<p>Qin Ling wanted to help Feng Qiuyan block, but she was held back by him.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan slowly stood up and stared at Dragon Granny. He said, “Sorry for making you wait so long, but there were some things I needed to settle before I could come. Otherwise, it would be useless even if I came.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, a Companion Beast appeared on Feng Qiuyan’s body. It was a male Companion Beast with a human torso and a snake as its lower body. It was wearing a robe that resembled a shaman.</p>
<p>“Mythical Companion Beast… You went to the Wind God Cave?” Qin Ling asked in surprise when she saw Feng Qiuyan’s Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“Yes, there are some things that require sufficient strength to do. Therefore, I went to the Wind God Cave and contracted the Companion Beast inside before coming to pick you up,” Feng Qiuyan said.</p>
<p>Qin Ling was delighted. She naturally knew what the Wind God Cave was.</p>
<p>It was a dimensional zone that only people with the Feng family bloodline could enter. There was a special Companion Beast there. Although it wasn’t a Companion Egg, as long as a person had the Feng family’s bloodline flowing in them, it could be taken in as a Companion Beast like incubating a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>However, the Companion Beast needed too much Essence Energy. Many generations of the Feng family, including many powerful Epic experts, wanted to subdue it, but they ultimately failed. Although they didn’t die, their cultivation levels were crippled.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan had actually gone to the Wind God Cave for her, making Qin Ling’s previously disheartened heart feel like a withering tree ushering in spring.</p>
<p>The strange Companion Beast transformed into a gust of wind that attached itself to Feng Qiuyan’s body as though it had vanished.</p>
<p>However, Feng Qiuyan’s aura was rapidly rising.</p>
<p>Dragon Granny looked at Feng Qiuyan in surprise. Although she couldn’t recognize the origins of the Companion Beast, she could tell from Feng Qiuyan’s aura that it was no trifling matter.</p>
<p>“If you don’t want her to die, it’s best you stand there and do nothing,” said Dragon Granny as she raised the rattle drum in her hand.</p>
<p>Clearly, she wanted to use Miya to threaten Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>“If I were you, I wouldn’t move because as long as you shake that rattle drum, I will behead you,” Feng Qiuyan said calmly.</p>
<p>“Interesting. A mere human actually dares to threaten me because of a Companion Beast. I want to see how you will behead me…” As Dragon Granny spoke, she was about to shake the rattle drum in her hand.</p>
<p>However, just as her hand moved, Feng Qiuyan’s figure vanished like the wind. When he appeared again, he was already behind Dragon Granny.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The rattle drum in the Dragon Granny’s hand snapped and half of it fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Dragon Granny was alarmed. She didn’t see how Feng Qiuyan moved. She wanted to turn her head to look, but despite her head moving, her body didn’t move.</p>
<p>The head landed on the ground before her body collapsed. One of the seven dragon monarchs, Dragon Granny, had died just like that.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan also spat out a mouthful of blood. The mysterious Companion Beast automatically separated from his body and transformed back into a tattoo.</p>
<p>The incantation patterns on Miya’s neck vanished as her body gradually recovered its strength. She looked at the corpse of Dragon Granny on the ground in disbelief.</p>
<p>“What Companion Beast is that? It doesn’t look like a dragon?” Miya asked Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan shook his head and said, “I don’t know his name. I only know that his surname is Feng and that he only follows people from the Feng family. However, my strength is too weak. I can’t even withstand the shock produced when I use his strength.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the waves churned and the water stirred. The Seven Seas Dragon King charged into the Sea God Reef dimensional zone in a frenzy as he had sensed Dragon Granny’s death.</p>
<h3 id='chapter975'>Chapter 975: Grown Up</h3>
<p>“No good. It’s the Seven Seas Dragon King. I’ll hold it back. You guys return to the land first.” Miya had only been restricted previously; she wasn’t injured.</p>
<p>Although Feng Qiuyan had obtained the mysterious Mythical Companion Beast, its strength was too powerful. His body couldn’t withstand it if it attached itself to him in a soul form.</p>
<p>Previously, his body had already suffered damage from only using it briefly. It was obvious how powerful the Companion Beast was.</p>
<p>Miya rushed out of the cabin and immediately saw the Seven Seas Dragon King’s true body. Due to Dragon Granny’s death, he was already enraged and didn’t bother hiding. When he saw Miya come out, the seven dragon-like tentacles swept over.</p>
<p>Miya transformed into the Golden Dragon King and charged forward to fight the Seven Seas Dragon King.</p>
<p>Her body was no weaker than the Seven Seas Dragon King’s. It was even stronger than the Seven Seas Dragon King’s body. Golden beams of light shone resplendently, causing the seawater to surge and huge waves to appear on the surface of the sea.</p>
<p>The Turtle Minister also rushed forward with his spear and helped Miya attack the Seven Seas Dragon King.</p>
<p>However, the Turtle Minister wasn’t as fast as Miya. He was accidentally hit by the white liquid spewed out from the strange dragon’s mouth and was immediately stuck. It was as if he had been drenched by super glue. At first, he could still move, but soon, he couldn’t even move. He was sent flying by the strange dragon’s tentacles and smashed into the sand at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>Qin Ling helped the injured Feng Qiuyan swim towards the sea. A golden glow suffused her body as fine scales appeared on her skin. Her hair and pupils also turned pale golden.</p>
<p>Although she was still in human form, she didn’t look like a human. However, she wasn’t ugly. She just looked a little strange.</p>
<p>After transforming, Qin Ling’s speed in the water became extremely fast as she rapidly swam towards the coast with Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>Miya constantly fought the Seven Seas Dragon King. The terrifying Golden Dragon King body didn’t seem to be at a disadvantage. She was truly powerful.</p>
<p>However, she had yet to advance to the Terror grade. The Seven Seas Dragon King once again used the posture that resembled a Buddha chanting scriptures and entered the Terror transformation state.</p>
<p>Miya immediately felt that she had fallen into a heavy fog. She heard the chanting coming from all directions, but she couldn’t tell where the Seven Seas Dragon King was.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a strange dragon-like tentacle emerged from the fog and spat out white liquid at Miya.</p>
<p>Miya reacted extremely quickly as she twisted her dragon body to dodge, but other tentacles kept tearing out of the fog. Before Miya could react, she was immediately sprayed with white liquid.</p>
<p>Soon, Miya felt her body stiffen where the white liquid had hit. Her dragon claws were stuck to her body, making it abnormally difficult to brandish them.</p>
<p>More and more white liquid sprayed onto the Golden Dragon King Body. Miya was like a ferocious beast that had been bound. No matter how strong she was, it was useless. She was bitten by the Seven Seas Dragon King’s tentacles.</p>
<p>The seven strange dragons bit Miya’s body, but she couldn’t resist. Soon, she was covered in wounds.</p>
<p>The Seven Seas Dragon King clearly hated Miya to the core and didn’t devour her.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Leave now… I want to go back and save my sister…” Qin Ling gritted her teeth and rushed back when she saw Miya’s Golden Dragon King form being ravaged by the Seven Seas Dragon King.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan grabbed her and forcefully pulled her to the shore. “It’s useless if you go back. Go ashore first.”</p>
<p>“I know it’s useless, but if I don’t return, I won’t be able to feel at ease for the rest of my life.” Qin Ling wanted to shake Feng Qiuyan off.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Sis Ling.” Feng Qiuyan lifted Qin Ling up and ignored her protests as he rushed to the coast.</p>
<p>At that moment, the coast was filled with surging seawater. The beach could no longer be seen. Even the trees outside were covered in seawater.</p>
<p>“Wait at a spot where there’s no water. You are not to get down.” Feng Qiuyan placed Qin Ling down before turning around and diving into the sea.</p>
<p>Qin Ling stared blankly at Feng Qiuyan’s figure as he rushed into the sea. She suddenly realized that this wasn’t the Feng Qiuyan she had known in the past.</p>
<p>The little boy that followed behind her all day like a tail, the affectionate boy who called her Sis Ling, these originally clear impressions suddenly became blurry. Replacing them was the feeling of a man, not a boy.</p>
<p>He… has really grown up… Qin Ling’s expression was complicated. After some thought, she leaped onto a beacon beside her and waited for Feng Qiuyan in the sea.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After Feng Qiuyan descended into the sea, he quickly rushed back to where the Seven Seas Dragon King and Miya were fighting. The Golden Dragon King form that Miya had transformed into was severely injured.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan knew that he only had one chance. His body was already injured, so it was impossible for him to withstand the mysterious Companion Beast’s possession for long. He had to resolve the problem in one strike.</p>
<p>The Seven Seas Dragon King seemed to want to tear Miya apart. It thought that Miya had killed Dragon Granny, so he had a raging resentment.</p>
<p>This is a good opportunity. Feng Qiuyan summoned the mysterious Companion Beast and attached it to him in a soul form. After succeeding, Feng Qiuyan didn’t hesitate to draw his saber and slash.</p>
<p>It was the power of the wind. In an instant, it sliced through the seawater and slashed at the Seven Seas Dragon King’s body. However, when the blade struck the Seven Seas Dragon King, it was like a blunt blade slicing through a cow’s tendon. The strike with the strength of a Mythical Companion Beast only managed to slice through less than ten centimeters.</p>
<p>A ten-centimeter deep wound was fatal to humans.</p>
<p>However, to the massive Seven Seas Dragon King, it was nothing.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>With a flick of the strange dragon tentacle, Feng Qiuyan’s body was sent flying. He shot out of the sea like a cannonball with a huge splash.</p>
<p>As though he had had enough of the cat-and-mouse game, the Seven Seas Dragon King opened his main body’s mouth. It wanted to devour Miya alive so as to appease the hatred in its heart.</p>
<p>Miya was stuck to the white liquid and had no ability to resist. Knowing that it was impossible for her to live, she decided to transform into a human form and be swallowed by the Seven Seas Dragon King to prevent herself from being bitten and suffering so much pain.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Feng…” Qin Ling’s expression changed drastically when she saw Feng Qiuyan being thrown out of the water. She hurriedly rushed over and hugged him.</p>
<p>Seeing that Feng Qiuyan wasn’t dead despite his serious injuries, Qin Ling felt a little more at ease. She glanced at the sea and gritted her teeth before rushing out of Sea God Reef with Feng Qiuyan in her arms.</p>
<p>Although she really wanted to rush back and fight with Miya, she couldn’t allow Feng Qiuyan to die in front of her.</p>
<p>Just as they rushed back to the coast, they saw a man in black armor standing on the coast like a nobleman, blocking their path.</p>
<p>“Qin Ling, you don’t belong to the world over there yet. Return with me. In the future, you will become the new human progenitor,” the black-armored man said slowly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter976'>Chapter 976: Meeting Again</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen kept trying to figure out a way to leave the Seven Seas Dragon King’s stomach, but the place was filled with white liquid. He couldn’t even teleport in the white liquid, so it wasn’t easy to leave.</p>
<p>With the Chaos Egg’s protection, Zhou Wen’s life wasn’t in danger. He could slowly try all sorts of methods, hoping to restrain the Seven Seas Dragon King.</p>
<p>Firstly, it was the power of fire. This power was clearly useless against the white liquid, or perhaps Zhou Wen’s fire power level wasn’t high, so it was useless.</p>
<p>Companion Beasts with powerful bodies were useless. They would be stuck to the white liquid, unable to unleash their combat strength.</p>
<p>Weapon-type Companion Beasts were the same. No matter how sharp a Companion Beast was, it would be stuck to the white liquid. They were useless.</p>
<p>He basically tried all the Companion Beasts and abilities he had of every element, but they were useless.</p>
<p>Could it be that this white liquid is really that invincible? Is there no power that can restrain it? Zhou Wen didn’t believe it.</p>
<p>What other powers are there that I haven’t used? After some thought, Zhou Wen suddenly had an idea.</p>
<p>It was the Terror items he had put away previously. Those Terror items were extremely cold. If he could freeze the liquid into a solid, it might lose its stickiness.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen attempted to take out the bone and placed it in the white liquid. It was unknown if it was because only a Terror-grade power could restrain a Terror-grade power, or if it was because the freezing power was the nemesis of the white liquid, but the nearby white liquid quickly froze once the extremely cold bone was inserted into it.</p>
<p>Does it really work? Zhou Wen extended his hand to touch it and realized that the frozen white liquid was indeed no longer sticky. Furthermore, it no longer had any corrosive effects.</p>
<p>So the Seven Seas Dragon King is also restrained by this ice dragon’s power. In that case, the person who killed the ice dragon back then might not be the Seven Seas Dragon King. It’s very likely the human who has a Guardian, Zhou Wen guessed.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it would be very difficult to explain why the Seven Seas Dragon King could still kill the ice dragon when his power was restrained by the ice dragon’s bone.</p>
<p>Was Miya’s father also killed by that man? Zhou Wen thought of Miya’s father again. The possibility of his father leaving a Companion Egg behind and being killed by a human was very high.</p>
<p>With a method to restrain the white liquid, Zhou Wen froze the surrounding white liquid, but he soon discovered another problem.</p>
<p>The solidified white liquid was extremely tenacious and almost indestructible. He spent a lot of effort to shatter a small piece of the white solid.</p>
<p>This is a little troublesome. If I don’t freeze it, it will be too sticky. If I freeze it, it will be too hard. Zhou Wen attempted to use the ice dragon bone to strike it. It was a little easier than using a Mythical weapon, but his speed wasn’t fast.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was out of options. All he could do was freeze the white liquid as he shattered it. Thankfully, he had Tyrant Behemoth’s help. Otherwise, Zhou Wen’s progress would have been even worse.</p>
<p>The main reason was that Zhou Wen’s body didn’t have enough resistance to the cold, preventing him from touching the ice dragon bone for long periods of time. Even Tyrant Behemoth needed to use Absolute Strength to hold the ice dragon tooth for long periods of time without being injured.</p>
<p>As he was digging, he suddenly sensed the Seven Seas Dragon King’s rage. Then, he saw him fighting Miya and Feng Qiuyan. Although Zhou Wen wanted to help, he wasn’t able to leave for the time being.</p>
<p>Miya, who was covered in wounds, was swallowed and fell into the white liquid. She thought that she was doomed. Not only did the white liquid have a powerful stickiness, but it also had a terrifying corrosive ability. Even her Golden Dragon Body would find it difficult to withstand it for a long period of time. Furthermore, she was severely injured.</p>
<p>Just as Miya gave up hope of survival, she suddenly felt something grab her hand and pull her over forcefully. At the same time, she felt a terrifying coldness.</p>
<p>The white liquid that stuck to her body slowly became less sticky due to the cold. Soon, Miya was released by the hand.</p>
<p>When Miya came out of the white liquid, she almost couldn’t believe her eyes.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you’re still alive?” Miya looked at Zhou Wen in surprise and delight, almost believing that she was dreaming.</p>
<p>After being devoured by the Seven Seas Dragon King for so long, Zhou Wen was still alive. Furthermore, he didn’t seem to be injured.</p>
<p>“Is it strange that I’m alive?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“No, I just didn’t expect you to survive in the Seven Seas Dragon King’s stomach.” Miya looked around and realized that the white liquid had turned solid. It was no longer harmful.</p>
<p>“It’s all thanks to these things that I can survive in its stomach,” Zhou Wen said as he pointed at the ice dragon tooth in Tyrant Behemoth’s hand.</p>
<p>This thing can actually restrain the Seven Seas Dragon King’s mucus? Then how did the Seven Seas Dragon King kill the Ice Dragon King? Miya found it unbelievable when she saw it.</p>
<p>“I suspect that the Ice Dragon King wasn’t killed by the Seven Seas Dragon King at all, but by a human,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“A human? That’s even more impossible. How can a human kill the Ice Dragon King? It’s a Terror-grade existence.” Miya refused to believe this.</p>
<p>“Ordinary humans might not be able to do it, but it’s not impossible for humans with Guardians. Did the Seven Dragons Sea have a Guardian cocoon in the past?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. I’ve never heard of a Guardian cocoon here. Typical Guardian cocoons are in pure dimensional zones of a certain race. The dimensional creatures in the Seven Dragons Sea are too mixed. It’s not suitable to release Guardians here,” Miya said after some thought.</p>
<p>“Makes sense.” Zhou Wen told Miya the conversation he had heard.</p>
<p>Miya’s face was filled with disbelief when she heard that. “You mean that the Seven Seas Dragon King is only a puppet and the person who really controls the Seven Dragons Sea is a human?”</p>
<p>“That appears to be the case.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>“He wants to extract Qin Ling’s bloodline. Wouldn’t that mean Qin Ling is in grave danger? I have to think of a way to save her.” Miya looked at the white liquid around her, but she didn’t have a solution.</p>
<p>“Calm down. The other party needs to wait for the human-dragon bloodline in Qin Ling’s body to completely take form before getting his way with her. It will take at least a couple of weeks. We still have time.” As Zhou Wen spoke to Miya, he listened to the commotion outside. After the Seven Seas Dragon King had swallowed Miya, he left Sea God Reef and swam towards the abyss.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he made Tyrant Behemoth stop. Since he was safe now, he might as well follow the Seven Seas Dragon King into the abyssal palace. Perhaps he could learn more secrets.</p>
<h3 id='chapter977'>Chapter 977: Absolute Defense</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Miya asked Zhou Wen in puzzlement when she saw Tyrant Behemoth put down the ice dragon tooth and stop digging.</p>
<p>“The Seven Seas Dragon King has gone to see that person. Even if we can leave, only death awaits us. Let’s wait for now.” Zhou Wen didn’t have a good solution. Even if he didn’t wish to eavesdrop, now wasn’t the time to escape.</p>
<p>Sitting on the crystal, Zhou Wen took out his phone to continue gaming and grinding dungeons. He didn’t know how much time he needed to stay here, so since he had nothing to do, he gamed.</p>
<p>Miya knew that Zhou Wen was right. They couldn’t even defeat the Seven Seas Dragon King, much less the more terrifying human, so it was pointless for them to leave.</p>
<p>“Qin Ling was captured by them, right?” Although Miya had already guessed the answer, she still hoped that Zhou Wen could give her a different answer.</p>
<p>“She’s probably captured.” Although Zhou Wen didn’t see the man capture Feng Qiuyan and Qin Ling, he could guess that the man wouldn’t let Qin Ling leave.</p>
<p>Miya was vexed, but there was nothing she could do. She couldn’t even leave to risk her life now.</p>
<p>“When can we leave?” Miya asked, but she was suddenly stunned. She realized that she seemed to be overly reliant on the human in front of her.</p>
<p>In the past, she wouldn’t even spare humans a glance, much less ask such a foolish question.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked up at Miya and said, “Don’t worry. I’ll save them.”</p>
<p>Although it was a simple sentence, Miya felt much better after hearing it. It was as though Zhou Wen could really do it.</p>
<p>The Seven Seas Dragon King returned to the underwater abyss, but to Zhou Wen’s dismay, he didn’t head for the underwater palace where the human was. Instead, he entered a cave to rest.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only wait patiently. With a minion like the Seven Seas Dragon King available, it was impossible for the human to let the Seven Seas Dragon King sleep in the cave.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that it was useless to burn with anxiety. He grinded dungeons as usual and also farmed some Mortal Companion Eggs for the Evil Spirit King, hoping that he could evolve as soon as possible.</p>
<p>He went to the Ancient Sword Tomb dungeon again, a place where Zhou Wen had often grinded in recent times. He hoped to obtain some inspiration and perhaps have a chance of evolving Sword Pill.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen had personally pulled out the swords and killed them when he visited Ancient Sword Tomb dungeons in recent times. He hadn’t gotten Tyrant Behemoth to take action, or it would have been difficult for him to gain any insight.</p>
<p>The ancient swords were pulled out by the blood-colored avatar and killed. Quite a number of crystals dropped, but nothing new triggered.</p>
<p>Could it be that the advancement of Sword Pill has nothing to do with swords? Zhou Wen thought to himself, but there was nothing he could do. This was the only solution he could think of at the moment.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen came in front of a sword tomb again and pulled out a short sword.</p>
<p>The short sword was red in color and looked like it was made of red bronze. It was exquisite and elegant. The hilt was in the shape of a phoenix’s head, and the guard was a pair of wings. Furthermore, this short sword had a scabbard.</p>
<p>At the instant the short sword was pulled out, terrifying flames erupted from the scabbard. It scalded Zhou Wen so much that he immediately released his grip and hurriedly summoned and wore Galaxy Shell Dragon’s armor.</p>
<p>The short sword filled the sky with flames as it attacked Zhou Wen again. It was clearly a Mythical fire-elemental ancient sword. The power of the flames was rather powerful.</p>
<p>The defense of the Galaxy Shell Dragon armor surprised Zhou Wen. It was able to block the ancient sword’s attack without activating Absolute Defense.</p>
<p>However, the flaming sword aura on the ancient sword heated the armor so much that it was scalding.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen activated Absolute Defense, he realized that he couldn’t even feel the burning heat of the flaming sword beam. Zhou Wen stood there and allowed the ancient sword to constantly slash at him. At most, it would only send him retreating a few steps with Absolute Defense preventing him from being injured at all.</p>
<p>What powerful defense! Zhou Wen was overjoyed. Such armor’s defense was definitely a life-saving weapon. It was much stronger than Dragon Scale Armor.</p>
<p>The strength of Absolute Defense was probably comparable to Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength. However, one was for offense while the other was for defense.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I ambushed and killed the Galaxy Shell Dragon. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been easy to kill it in a head-on battle. Zhou Wen was secretly delighted.</p>
<p>The duration of Absolute Defense was shorter than Absolute Strength, but it was already very strong. Even top Mythical powers couldn’t injure Zhou Wen when Absolute Defense was activated.</p>
<p>Absolute Strength… Absolute Defense… Could there be something like Absolute Speed… If I can gather an Absolute set, it will be really impressive, Zhou Wen thought greedily.</p>
<p>After testing the strength of the Galaxy Shell Dragon, Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to waste time with the ancient sword. He summoned Light Concealment Sword to fight it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s sword techniques were pretty good now, but he couldn’t gain an advantage against the short sword.</p>
<p>As he fought, Zhou Wen suddenly realized that there was no need for him to work so hard. He didn’t need to do it himself. He was a man with Sword Pill.</p>
<p>Sword Pill was similar to flying swords. It could be used hands-free, so there was no need for him to use a sword to slash others.</p>
<p>I wonder if Sword Pill’s strength can withstand a Mythical weapon. Zhou Wen summoned Sword Pill and planned on giving it a try.</p>
<p>With a thought, the resplendent diamond-like Sword Pill appeared in front of Zhou Wen. Then, with Zhou Wen’s will, it stabbed at the short sword.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>Sword Pill and the short sword constantly clashed in midair, turning Zhou Wen into a spectator.</p>
<p>It feels so good not having to use a sword to slash at others. It’s no wonder so many people like flying swords. It’s indeed a skill best suited for lazy people. Zhou Wen was somewhat delighted.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because he had found another way to be lazy, but because the strength of Sword Pill could actually clash head-on with a Mythical sword without being damaged.</p>
<p>It’s really good stuff. Zhou Wen used the 3,000 sword intents. Sword Pill already had the concepts of the 3,000 sword intents. Now, with Zhou Wen using the thirteen stances, the might and concepts were much stronger than when Zhou Wen slashed with his sword.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Sword Pill didn’t have any restrictions. It could use the moves far more frequently than when Zhou Wen used them himself. It also had a lot more freedom.</p>
<p>If I can really raise Sword Pill to the Mythical stage one day, will I be like the legendary sword immortals in ancient times, able to behead enemies from thousands of kilometers away? The more Zhou Wen used Sword Pill, the more he found it convenient. He decided to use the short sword as a sparring partner and used all 3,000 sword intents.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t notice that during the battle between Sword Pill and the short sword, some ancient swords in the Ancient Sword Tomb would tremble gently as though they were responding to the sword intents in Sword Pill.</p>
<h3 id='chapter978'>Chapter 978: Bronze Sparrow Sword</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The characteristics of Sword Pill were very strange. Typical weapons or mobile Life Souls needed contact during usage for the injection of Essence Energy into the weapon.</p>
<p>Even if one could transmit Essence Energy across space, there would be a transmission path that resembled a ribbon.</p>
<p>However, Sword Pill was completely different. It seemed to have some spatial teleportation ability between it and Zhou Wen. Even if they were very far apart, Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy could instantly transfer into Sword Pill without loss. He couldn’t find any traces of transmission.</p>
<p>Be it control or Essence Energy delivery, there was no delay. This was very rare.</p>
<p>At the very least, Zhou Wen had never seen such an ability on other weapons.</p>
<p>Exploiting the characteristics of Sword Pill, Zhou Wen could attack from afar without any worries. It was almost the same as him attacking with a sword in hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen controlled the Sword Pill and constantly fought the ancient sword. His control over Sword Pill became stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Sword Pill was only an Epic Life Soul after all. It was still somewhat difficult to defeat a Mythical ancient sword.</p>
<p>During the battle, Zhou Wen discovered some strange phenomena. When he made Sword Pill use a particular sword intent, some swords in the Ancient Sword Tomb would react to the sword intent.</p>
<p>Different ancient swords would react to different sword intents.</p>
<p>The reaction to sword intent means that the ancient sword has a similar concept, which is why it resonates. Doesn’t that mean that I can use the sword intent on Sword Pill to determine which type of ancient sword it is? However, just judging the type doesn’t seem to be of much use. If only I could directly determine which sword is at the Mythical stage. As Zhou Wen fought, he observed the ancient swords that reacted.</p>
<p>After a while, Zhou Wen suddenly realized that perhaps he could really determine the level of the ancient sword through the sword intent resonance.</p>
<p>This was because low-level ancient swords had very weak sword intent resonance. They didn’t even have sword intents, so it was relatively difficult to trigger a resonance with them.</p>
<p>As for the stronger ancient swords, they were easier to trigger a resonance due to their stronger sword intents. These ancient swords were mainly at the Epic stage.</p>
<p>At a higher level, like the Mythical ancient swords, Zhou Wen’s sword intent had to be sufficiently high in order to trigger their resonance because their sword intents were extremely powerful. Therefore, it was relatively difficult.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen came to a conclusion. Ancient swords that could easily resonate were typically at the Epic stage, with a small number at the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>As for the ancient swords that didn’t resonate easily, they were either the strongest Mythical ones, the weakest Legendary ones, or even Mortal ones. In any case, they were either the best or the worst.</p>
<p>Although he couldn’t distinguish it accurately, eliminating a large number of options was huge progress for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>In the constant battle with the ancient sword, Zhou Wen had a strange thought. Since Sword Pill has already fused with 3,000 sword intents and can cause various types of ancient swords to resonate, it means that it has all sorts of different characteristics. Therefore, it’s clearly wrong for me to want to turn it into a particular sword. However, there’s no sword in the world that can be compatible with all characteristics. Then, can I make Sword Pill become a sword that’s suited for a particular sword intent when the respective sword intent is used?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if Sword Pill had such a transformation ability, but he decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what kind of sword should be matched with what kind of sword intent, but with the Ancient Sword Tomb, it wasn’t a problem. All he needed to do was use one type of sword intent and pull out the ancient sword that resonated with it. Then, he could understand all the characteristics of the ancient sword through battle.</p>
<p>However, before that, Zhou Wen had to defeat the ancient sword with fire-elemental powers.</p>
<p>The ancient sword was extremely difficult to deal with. It was clearly difficult to defeat it with Zhou Wen’s sword techniques and strength alone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wish to waste any more time, so he summoned Tyrant Behemoth. With Tyrant Behemoth’s help, he quickly snapped the short sword.</p>
<p>‘Killed Mythical creature, Bronze Sparrow Sword. Discovered Companion Egg.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be delighted. He didn’t have many fire-elemental Companion Eggs, and weapons were even rarer. This Mythical ancient sword was rather good and could be used.</p>
<p>After incubating the Bronze Sparrow Sword, Zhou Wen willed the red bronze short sword with a scabbard into his hand.</p>
<p>The Bronze Sparrow Sword had similar attributes with the Light Concealment Sword, but its Life Providence and Life Soul both had fire attributes. When it attacked, it came with fire attributes. This was something Light Concealment Sword didn’t possess.</p>
<p>The Bronze Sparrow Sword’s Wheel of Destiny was surprising. It wasn’t a Wheel of Destiny with offensive abilities, but the ability to be reborn from flames.</p>
<p>Even if the Bronze Sparrow Sword was destroyed, as long as its scabbard remained, it could use the flames in the scabbard to self-repair.</p>
<p>So the Bronze Sparrow Sword has such an ability. Thankfully, Tyrant Behemoth destroyed the sword and scabbard together. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been easy to kill it. Zhou Wen was quite appreciative of the Bronze Sparrow Sword.</p>
<p>However, after using it for a while, he realized that the sword was useless to him. Such a powerful fire attribute wasn’t suitable for sneak attacks. Also, Zhou Wen wasn’t good at fire-elemental sword techniques. It was not as relaxing using Sword Pill.</p>
<p>Yet, the advantages of the Bronze Sparrow Sword were very obvious. It was very effective against ice-elemental elements. Furthermore, it could be reborn from fire. It would be very useful at times.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to put away the Bronze Sparrow Sword. He would use it when he needed it in the future, or if there was a suitable opportunity. It wouldn’t be a bad idea to use it for fusion.</p>
<p>After he was done with the Bronze Sparrow Sword, Zhou Wen began his plan of matching his sword intent with the swords. He first used Sword Pill to trigger the ancient swords’ resonance before pulling out a resonating ancient sword. Through combat, he fully understood the sword’s characteristics.</p>
<p>Although Sword Pill didn’t change in the beginning, Zhou Wen realized that the matched sword intent became stronger during the battle.</p>
<p>Bored, Zhou Wen had nothing else to do other than grind dungeons in the Seven Seas Dragon King’s stomach.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there was plenty of food in the chaos space, so there was no need to be afraid of starving. Zhou Wen took out plenty of food and drinks and shared a portion with Miya.</p>
<p>In order to rest better, Zhou Wen even stored mattresses and other items. He even took out a player that had many movies and music stored in it for Miya to kill time.</p>
<p>When Miya saw that Zhou Wen was like a magical pocket that constantly produced all sorts of novel and strange things, she increasingly felt that he was different from the rest of humanity.</p>
<p>For the next few days, the Seven Seas Dragon King slept in the cave and didn’t see the male human again.</p>
<p>It was useless for Zhou Wen to worry. All he could do was get Tyrant Behemoth to open up a passageway while he constantly grinded dungeons to practice his sword techniques. He hoped to raise Sword Pill to a Perfect Body.</p>
<h3 id='chapter979'>Chapter 979: Successful Parasitizing</h3>
<p>Constant daily practice brought about excellent results. Although Sword Pill hadn’t advanced, Zhou Wen’s sword technique had improved tremendously.</p>
<p>Although it wasn’t as good as his movement technique, he had already gained some level of mastery in the way of the sword. It wasn’t like before when he only used a sword as a blade to slash at people.</p>
<p>With practice came interest. Although they were all swords, the usage and concepts of different swords were different. Some very subtle things could not be understood by just looking at them. He had to experience them personally.</p>
<p>As he had truly put in hard work, be it his sword intents or the thirteen sword arts, they had advanced by leaps and bounds. Zhou Wen felt that the thirteen sword arts were likely to be the second Mythical technique he would master.</p>
<p>Seven days had passed, but the Seven Seas Dragon King remained motionless. It slept in the cave, somewhat different from what Zhou Wen had imagined.</p>
<p>Although Tyrant Behemoth had already penetrated the white liquid and discovered that they were inside something that resembled a stomach, it was useless even if they could escape if they couldn’t save Qin Ling and company.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen kept placating Miya, getting her to wait patiently.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t think it was feasible to just wait. Since the white liquid had been penetrated, Zhou Wen decided to try releasing Primordial Spore to see if he could parasitize the Seven Seas Dragon King from the inside.</p>
<p>In theory, it was impossible for a Mythical Primordial Spore to parasitize a Terror-grade Seven Seas Dragon King.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen felt that it wasn’t impossible for Primordial Spore to do so. After all, it was currently in the Seven Seas Dragon King’s body. This was a huge advantage. Furthermore, the Seven Seas Dragon King was sleeping, so its bodily functions were at their lowest in all aspects. Perhaps Primordial Spore had a chance.</p>
<p>The tiny Primordial Spore flew out of the Seven Seas Dragon King’s stomach and quickly landed on the inner wall of an organ like a speck of dust.</p>
<p>The organs of the Seven Seas Dragon King were still undulating evenly without any abnormalities. Only then did Zhou Wen heave a sigh of relief. Although he didn’t know if he could successfully parasitize it, from the looks of it, Primordial Spore hadn’t been discovered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued waiting. If Primordial Spore could successfully parasitize the Seven Seas Dragon King, it would undoubtedly be great news for him.</p>
<p>Following that was another long wait. Zhou Wen spent every day grinding dungeons to train. His sword intents constantly became stronger, and his sword techniques seemed to gain divine augmentation.</p>
<p>In Zhou Wen’s mind, he also memorized the characteristics and usage of various swords. Furthermore, Zhou Wen vaguely felt that Sword Pill seemed to show signs of advancing.</p>
<p>Three thousand sword intents needed to be matched with three thousand swords. Most sword intents could find their corresponding sword in the Ancient Sword Tomb.</p>
<p>However, there were still many sword intents that failed to find a sword to resonate with in the Ancient Sword Tomb.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if it was because his sword intent wasn’t strong enough to trigger the high-level swords or if it was because there was no ancient sword with the corresponding sword intent in the Ancient Sword Tomb.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that the former was more likely, so he planned on raising his sword intent level.</p>
<p>Although sword intent stemmed from a sword art, it was something that required comprehension instead of practice. If one could comprehend it, they might only need an instant to raise their strength.</p>
<p>However, if one couldn’t comprehend it, they might not be able to improve even if they trained for ten years.</p>
<p>Training hard definitely doesn’t work, but if I don’t train, I won’t be able to understand the true intent of the sword, so I naturally won’t be able to comprehend sword intent. What should I do? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and he came up with a solution that wasn’t a solution.</p>
<p>He first used the three thousand sword intents to trigger the ancient swords’ resonance before plucking the ancient swords that had never resonated. Although he might encounter low-level swords, he might also encounter Mythical swords. In that scenario, he would narrow down the range of finding Mythical swords.</p>
<p>During the battle with high-level swords, he could comprehend his own sword intent.</p>
<p>Pulling out a sword, fighting, pulling out a sword, and fighting again—Zhou Wen kept repeating this process.</p>
<p>“What’s the thing you play all day?” Miya had observed Zhou Wen for many days. Although she wasn’t interested in human games, it was boring here, so she couldn’t help but ask after seeing him game on his phone.</p>
<p>“This? A mobile game. I can obtain experience and equipment by killing monsters,” Zhou Wen explained.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, Miya’s expression turned odd. She didn’t think of herself as a monster in the past, nor could she understand why Qin Ling was so vexed because of her Golden Dragon bloodline.</p>
<p>However, after hearing Zhou Wen’s unintentional words today, Miya suddenly understood why Qin Ling minded her dragon bloodline. This was because she also felt uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Do you want to play?” Zhou Wen looked up and asked Miya.</p>
<p>“No.” Miya shook her head and sat back on her mat to watch some dramas. However, she couldn’t get into it no matter what. She was somewhat in a daze.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what Miya was thinking as he continued practicing his swordplay in-game.</p>
<p>This was already the eleventh day since Zhou Wen and Miya had entered the Seven Seas Dragon King’s body. The Seven Seas Dragon King was still sleeping, but Zhou Wen received a signal that delighted him.</p>
<p>Primordial Spore had successfully parasitized the Seven Seas Dragon King. Although it was only a preliminary parasitization and it would take some time to truly control the Seven Seas Dragon King, this was already very good news for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>I hope there’s still time. Zhou Wen had eavesdropped on the conversation between Dragon Granny and the man. He knew that if Qin Ling drank that thing, she would reach adulthood in a couple of weeks. When that happened, the man would extract Qin Ling’s bloodline and create something that could turn humans into human-dragons.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had to save Qin Ling before that. He didn’t know if becoming a human-dragon was good or bad, but humans needed the right to choose. Zhou Wen felt that such a forceful mutation was a little too much. At the very least, he didn’t wish to become a Dracotaur.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be better to become a cat-man? Zhou Wen thought to himself. If he had to choose to transform, he would rather become a cat. At the very least, it wouldn’t be that ugly.</p>
<p>“Do you know sword arts?” Zhou Wen suddenly asked Miya one day.</p>
<p>“No.” Miya shook her head and asked curiously, “Why are you suddenly asking this?”</p>
<p>“If you know sword arts, I want to see your sword intent.” After cultivating for so many days, Zhou Wen felt that his sword art had reached a bottleneck. If he could improve further, his sword art would probably break through to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>However, this bottleneck was clearly not that easy to break through. Furthermore, time was indeed too short. It had only been a few days since he began practicing seriously.</p>
<p>“The concepts in the world are all interconnected. Although I don’t know sword arts, I can let you see my concept if you want to see it,” said Miya.</p>
<h3 id='chapter980'>Chapter 980: Myriad Sword Resonance</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“If it’s possible, please let me take a look.” Zhou Wen felt that he really needed to change his train of thought. Otherwise, he would only walk into a dead end if he just continued doing the same.</p>
<p>Miya thought for a moment and said, “I’m a Golden Dragon. All my powers are obtained through inheritance. I only know one concept, and that is Golden Dragon King Battle Intent.”</p>
<p>“Battle Intent? How is it different from ordinary concepts?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure either. Have a feel of it yourself,” Miya said as she pressed a hand to Zhou Wen’s forehead.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dodge and allowed Miya’s palm to press on his forehead. As he didn’t dare cause too much of a stir in the Seven Seas Dragon King’s body, Miya directly imprinted her Golden Dragon King Battle Intent into Zhou Wen’s mind, allowing him to sense her battle intent.</p>
<p>At that instant, Zhou Wen seemed to see an extremely terrifying Golden Dragon King appear in the world. It was ferocious and domineering, as though it was the overlord of the entire world. The terrifying battle intent made all life tremble.</p>
<p>It was a primordial era. Lightning, fires, floods, and all sorts of calamities frequently descended. All sorts of creatures died in the calamity. Only creatures with extremely powerful vitality could survive in such primordial times.</p>
<p>The Golden Dragon King grew in such an environment. At the same time, due to the extinction of all things, food became extremely scarce. All sorts of terrifying creatures could only fight each other and eat each other’s flesh and blood.</p>
<p>Combat! Crazy combat! One could only survive through combat.</p>
<p>The Golden Dragon King might not be the most powerful beast, nor was it the beast with the strongest defense, much less the fastest beast.</p>
<p>However, through constant combat, the Golden Dragon King rapidly grew. It constantly transformed and evolved in battle, eventually allowing it to stand at the top of the food chain.</p>
<p>The unyielding, fearless, brave, crazy, and intelligent will left even Zhou Wen, who was a spectator, deeply shocked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that this was the inherited memories of the Golden Dragons. The Golden Dragon King in the Battle Intent was actually the first generation Golden Dragon King. It probably didn’t exist in the world anymore.</p>
<p>However, its fearless battle intent was eternal.</p>
<p>There’s no such thing as having good fortune after surviving a great calamity in this world. It’s just that I obtained enough insight and growth in a great calamity to improve myself. Zhou Wen came to a realization as though he understood why his sword art had yet to make a breakthrough.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because he didn’t practice well enough, nor was it because his comprehension was lacking, nor was it because he wasn’t diligent enough.</p>
<p>It was because no matter how much Zhou Wen cultivated, he was ultimately learning something from others. He was learning the three thousand sword intents without comprehending something that belonged to him in battle.</p>
<p>This also had something to do with Zhou Wen’s views. He hadn’t planned on practicing sword arts to begin with. He had only learned sword arts to advance Sword Pill, so naturally, he just needed to master it. He hadn’t planned on improving it further.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen now realized that he had underestimated sword arts. Everything in the world had its own principles. If he didn’t put his heart into it, no matter how smart he was, it would be difficult for him to reach the extreme.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen realize that he hadn’t lost to the sword art, but to himself.</p>
<p>Indeed, one needs to put their heart in everything they do. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but think hard.</p>
<p>“I hope my Battle Intent can help you,” Miya said as she retracted her hand when she saw that Zhou Wen had escaped the influence of her Battle Intent.</p>
<p>“Thank you so much. It was very useful. You’ve helped me greatly.” Zhou Wen thanked her sincerely.</p>
<p>If Miya hadn’t shown him the Golden Dragon King Battle Intent, he wouldn’t have realized his problems. It was easy for animals like humans to discover the problems of others, but it was the hardest to discover their own problems.</p>
<p>After figuring all of this out, Zhou Wen felt a sense of clarity. When he thought about the 3,000 sword intents again, he immediately felt different. It was as though he was observing the 3,000 sword intents from a different angle and discovered many things that he hadn’t noticed before.</p>
<p>Miya looked at Zhou Wen and suddenly realized that his aura had changed. It was ethereal and illusory in a rather surreal fashion.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was standing in front of her, she felt that he resembled a virtual projection. He didn’t give of the feeling that he was an existence made of flesh and blood.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen’s presence continued to decrease. If she closed her eyes, she wouldn’t even be able to sense him standing in front of her.</p>
<p>“What… did you do…” Miya looked at Zhou Wen in a daze, not daring to take her eyes off him. It was as though Zhou Wen would vanish if she didn’t keep her eyes on him.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. I just gained some insight after seeing your Golden Dragon King Battle Intent,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Miya’s expression turned even odder. She really didn’t understand what Zhou Wen’s performance had to do with the Golden Dragon King Battle Intent.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen’s battle intent surged like the reincarnation of a Tyrannosaurus, Miya would believe that it was something he had comprehended from the Golden Dragon King Battle Intent.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s presence was getting weaker and weaker. This was completely at odds with the Golden Dragon King Battle Intent. Miya couldn’t understand how Zhou Wen connected the two and comprehended such things.</p>
<p>Are humans… all so strange? Miya was secretly puzzled.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t explain further because some things couldn’t be explained with words. After sitting down, he took out his phone and entered the game again.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the Ancient Sword Tomb again, Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to use his sword. He walked to a sword tomb and reached to pull out the sword.</p>
<p>After the ancient sword was pulled out, it immediately struggled amidst Zhou Wen’s palm and flew into the air, prepared to attack.</p>
<p>However, the ancient sword spun a few times in midair as though it couldn’t see Zhou Wen. It didn’t attack him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored it and walked to another sword tomb, pulling out the ancient sword from it.</p>
<p>The outcome was the same. The ancient sword streaked across the sky as though it couldn’t see Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pulled out swords as he walked. He pulled out hundreds of ancient swords of different levels and attributes, but none of them attacked him as though he wasn’t the one pulling them out.</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhou Wen finally moved. With a tap of his finger, the resplendent Sword Pill tore through the air and streaked across the sky. More than a hundred ancient swords were instantly sliced apart by Sword Pill. Not a single sword could withstand a single strike from Sword Pill. The remnant sword fragments fell to the ground, leaving only Sword Pill floating in front of Zhou Wen. Above Zhou Wen and Sword Pill was an extremely terrifying sword intent.</p>
<p>Hum!</p>
<p>Inside the Sword Tomb, the myriad swords resonated.</p>
<h3 id='chapter981'>Chapter 981: Perfect Sword Pill</h3>
<p>“A swordsman, a ferocious weapon. If the sword doesn’t move, it’s like a Buddha or an immortal. If the sword moves, it will slaughter Buddha and destroy immortals. If you lack the intent, why move the sword? If I were to strike, I would make the entire world my enemy,” Zhou Wen muttered to himself as he stared at Sword Pill in front of him.</p>
<p>Sword Pill emitted a blinding sword beam, and the ancient swords in the Ancient Sword Tomb hummed even louder.</p>
<p>Ancient swords tore out of the ground and flew out without anyone needing to pull them out. Countless ancient swords tore out of the tombs and charged at Zhou Wen and Sword Pill like a rain of swords. The turn of events was truly terrifying. Even the world changed color.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid. The baneful aura on Sword Pill surged as it circled around him. Any ancient sword that approached Zhou Wen was instantly sliced apart by Sword Pill.</p>
<p>Ancient swords rained down. Three feet around Zhou Wen’s body were filled with shards and broken handles, but there wasn’t a single sword within three feet. Only Sword Pill, which seemed as powerful as a god, culled all the swords in a shocking manner.</p>
<p>A dragon-like sword hum tore through the air. It was a white ancient sword with the aura of a wyrm on it. It was blinding as it transformed into a wyrm-like sword beam that streaked across the sky towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The sword was clearly a Mythical weapon, a sovereign of swords.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t seem to take it to heart. He extended his hand and beckoned at the sword pill before coolly saying, “Sword, come.”</p>
<p>With that said, Sword Pill transformed into a stream of light that charged at Zhou Wen’s palm. When it landed in his palm, Sword Pill had already transformed into a real sword.</p>
<p>The sword was four feet long. The sword’s spine was straight and firm, like a gentleman’s back that never bowed. Blood patterns could be vaguely seen on the sword.</p>
<p>The Wyrm Sword slashed down in midair, but Zhou Wen didn’t retreat as he slashed out in defiance of the heavens.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The wyrm-like sword beam was forcefully cleaved apart by the sword in Zhou Wen’s hand. The wyrm sword collided with the blade and was sent flying.</p>
<p>Hum!</p>
<p>Another ancient sword tore out of the ground with a terrifying sword aura. The sword was wide and huge, and it was extremely heavy. When it slashed down, it was like a mountain pressing down on him. Its might seemed unstoppable.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid as he brandished his sword to meet it. However, the sword in his hand changed its appearance, turning into a soft azure sword.</p>
<p>The sword was as thin as cicada wings and as light as muslin.</p>
<p>When the two swords clashed, the sword in Zhou Wen’s hand wrapped around the heavy sword like silk. He used the momentum to fling the heavy sword away, causing it to slam into a large sword tomb.</p>
<p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>
<p>Terrifying ancient swords tore out of the grave one after another, bringing with them boundless sword beams as though they were determined to destroy Zhou Wen and the sword in his hand.</p>
<p>Yet, Zhou Wen showed no fear as he brandished his sword to meet the terrifying Mythical swords.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen struck, the sword in his hand transformed into thousands of shapes. When facing any sword, his sword, sword moves, and sword intent would transform into a form that restrained the other party.</p>
<p>Although the other party was at the Mythical stage and was one level higher than him, Zhou Wen wasn’t at a disadvantage in battle.</p>
<p>From beginning to end, seven Mythical swords joined the battle. Zhou Wen single-handedly used his sword art to fight the seven swords without being at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was engrossed in the battle, Sword Pill in his hand transformed into the shape of Bamboo Blade. He fused with the saber and used Immortal Slaying to slice through one of the Mythical swords.</p>
<p>However, due to his excessive strength and expenditure, he was killed by six Mythical swords before he could catch his breath.</p>
<p>Seeing the game screen turn black, Zhou Wen wasn’t vexed at all. Instead, he was delighted.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, his sword art had advanced to the Mythical stage, and his Sword Pill had also advanced to a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>Dripping a drop of blood to revive, he launched the game again and read the blood-colored avatar’s stats.</p>
<p>Indeed, Sword Pill had already advanced to a Perfect Body. Strangely, the name of Sword Pill didn’t change this time. It was still the words “Sword Pill.”</p>
<p>Among the Life Souls that changed their names during the first evolution, only Sword Pill didn’t change its name after the second evolution. It could be considered the only one.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at his skill column and indeed, there was an additional Mythical sword art.</p>
<p>Heart Defying Sword: Mythical</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was very satisfied with the sword art. Although he knew quite a number of Mythical techniques, the only ones he had truly mastered independently were Transcendent Flying Immortal and the Heart Defying Sword.</p>
<p>Of course, the level given by the game wasn’t important to Zhou Wen. What was important was that he finally knew how to use a sword. Furthermore, it was a very special sword art.</p>
<p>As Sword Pill had advanced to a Perfect Body, his Strength attribute also reached 41 points. The only remaining attribute was Speed.</p>
<p>I never expected that despite being best at movement techniques, my Speed stat is the last to reach 41. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but sigh. Some things were simply out of his control.</p>
<p>If he were to choose, he would definitely raise his Speed attribute, but he failed to do so.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he only needed to raise Glimmer to a Perfect Body to raise his Speed stat to 41 points. If everything went well, he could use the Lost Immortal Sutra to advance to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen entered the Ancient Sword Tomb again. This time, he no longer had the mind of sword practice. However, with the Heart Defying Sword’s sword intent and Sword Pill, he had a good way of farming in Ancient Sword Tomb.</p>
<p>As long as he stimulated the Heart Defying Sword’s sword intent with all his might, he could trigger the myriad swords and get the Mythical swords to attack him.</p>
<p>Indeed, after Zhou Wen used the Heart Defying sword intent, the entire Ancient Sword Tomb boiled once again. The myriad swords resonated as many ancient swords automatically tore out of their tombs to kill Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they couldn’t pass Sword Pill at all. They were all sliced apart. Finally, the Mythical swords were activated. Unlike before, only six Mythical swords appeared.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Mythical swords this time were somewhat different from the previous six.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen estimated that every time the Ancient Sword Tomb respawned, seven Mythical swords would appear, but the type of Mythical swords that appeared wasn’t fixed.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen didn’t have any intention of practicing his sword intent. After luring out the Mythical swords, he activated his Mythical Companion Beast lineup. The six Mythical swords weren’t their match at all and were quickly killed.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>One of the Mythical swords dropped a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I’m really lucky. I just had a Bronze Sparrow drop not long ago. Now, there’s another one. Zhou Wen picked up the Companion Egg and was overjoyed when he saw it. It was Night Immaculate Sword.</p>
<p>Among the three famous swords in China, there was the high-grade Light Concealment, medium-grade Shadow Concealment, and low-grade Night Immaculate.</p>
<p>Now that Zhou Wen had the high and low-grade swords, he just lacked the middle-grade Shadow Concealment Sword.</p>
<p>If I can gather all three swords, I wonder if I can combine them into one? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t easy to have Shadow Concealment drop. It was unknown when it would drop. After all, the famous swords in the Ancient Sword Tomb were randomly respawned. He might not have Shadow Concealment Sword appear every time.</p>
<h3 id='chapter982'>Chapter 982: Seven Dragons Sea’s Great Mutation</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Night Immaculate: Mythical</p>
<p>Life Providence: Corporeal Sword</p>
<p>Life Soul: Corporeal Sword Aura</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Night Immaculate</p>
<p>Strength: 80</p>
<p>Speed: 80</p>
<p>Constitution: 80</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 81</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Sword Aura Slash, Sword Aura Wheel, Sword Aura Rain, Dao Integration Strike.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Sword</p>
<p>The attributes of Night Immaculate were very similar to Light Concealment, but they were slightly different. It was also considered a top-notch Companion Beast, but Night Immaculate couldn’t turn invisible.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned Night Immaculate and saw that it was condensed from a blob of sword aura. Although he could see it, that was all he could see—a blob of white sword aura. It was like a sword condensed from dense white fog.</p>
<p>After giving it a try, he realized that the various skills of Night Immaculate were about the same as Light Concealment. However, one was Sword Light, while the other was Sword Aura.</p>
<p>After matching Light Concealment and Night Immaculate, the compatibility between the two reached 91. If he wanted to fuse them, the success rate was very high.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t choose to fuse them. He still wanted to see how different the three swords would be when placed together.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen grinded for two more days without seeing the Shadow Concealment Sword, but something finally happened with the Seven Seas Dragon King.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Seven Seas Dragon King arrived at the man’s palace. The man wasn’t inside. The Seven Seas Dragon King passed through the palace and stopped behind it. Zhou Wen immediately saw the man, Feng Qiuyan, and Qin Ling.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan was locked in a crystal coffin and looked like he was asleep. As for Qin Ling, she was in a huge device. Part of the device was a crystal container with pure water inside. This was very similar to the water in the Deathwater Zone. Qin Ling was inside the pure water.</p>
<p>The pale golden scales had already covered her body. Dragon horns grew out of her head, making her look like a golden human human-dragon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if Qin Ling’s state was considered adulthood, but from the looks of it, the man’s experiment was already underway.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sized up the device, but he couldn’t tell what it was used for.</p>
<p>“Seven Seas, the time is ripe. Gather all the dimensional creatures in the Seven Seas,” the man said to the Seven Seas Dragon King.</p>
<p>After the Seven Seas Dragon King heard the order, it raised its seven strange dragon-like tentacles. The strange dragons opened their mouths and let out a silent roar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could hear a high-frequency sound wave with Truth Listener. This sound wave couldn’t be heard by ordinary ears, but all the dimensional creatures in the Seven Dragons Sea approached after hearing this sound wave.</p>
<p>The sea snakes in the Undersea Blue Hole, the lobsters in the Deathwater Zone, the clams on Infinite Island, and various dimensional creatures were gathering towards the abyss. The number was unimaginable.</p>
<p>What’s that man trying to do? Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>“Qin Ling, we may begin now.” A large number of dimensional creatures arrived outside the palace, but they could only swim in the sea and not enter the palace protected by a mysterious force.</p>
<p>“If I do as you say, will you let Feng Qiuyan off?” Qin Ling asked through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“I’m also a human. I don’t like killing my own kind. You can rest assured about that,” the man said.</p>
<p>Qin Ling glanced at Feng Qiuyan in the crystal coffin and gritted her teeth. She bit her tongue and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>
<p>This mouthful of blood was somewhat different from ordinary blood. It was actually golden. After the golden blood flowed out, it immediately mixed with the pure water.</p>
<p>After being diluted by the large amount of pure water, the mouthful of blood quickly disappeared.</p>
<p>The man reached out and pressed the device’s switch. The liquid in the huge jar spewed out and fused into the seawater above.</p>
<p>After the countless dimensional creatures outside were stained by the liquid in the jar, some low-level dimensional creatures quickly changed.</p>
<p>The sea snake actually grew claws, and scales grew on the clam maiden’s fair skin. All sorts of different dimensional creatures seemed to undergo changes. Even the fish-type dimensional creatures grew claws.</p>
<p>Could it be… Zhou Wen suddenly understood that after these dimensional creatures evolved, they had the characteristics of being close to dragons. Although they were still far from being comparable to real dragons, their bodies looked like they could already move on land.</p>
<p>These dimensional creatures that were originally in the sea might very well break out of the Seven Dragons Sea and enter land.</p>
<p>Just the thought of it left him horrified. It was impossible for Sea Return City’s people to withstand so many dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Should I go out and stop him now? Zhou Wen felt that even if he went out, he probably wouldn’t be able to stop the man from doing all of this.</p>
<p>He could still think of a way to deal with one Terror-grade, but it would probably be difficult for Zhou Wen to deal with two.</p>
<p>Primordial Spore, hurry up. Zhou Wen could only wait for Primordial Spore to finish the parasitization. If he could control the Seven Seas Dragon King to fight the man, he still had a chance of redeeming the situation.</p>
<p>More and more marine creatures came here to be baptized by the liquid that contained Qin Ling’s blood. Their bodies were also gradually transforming.</p>
<p>After Qin Ling spat out the golden blood, the man didn’t force her to do anything more. However, Qin Ling looked very dispirited. That mouthful of golden blood was unlikely to be as simple as ordinary blood.</p>
<p>The dimensional creatures in the entire Seven Dragons Sea were mutating. With time, the changes in their bodies became more apparent. Even the dimensional creatures that had completed their evolution didn’t leave. They kept circling the abyss.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could sense that the Seven Seas Dragon King’s consciousness was gradually blurring as Primordial Spore silently parasitized its soul.</p>
<p>To be able to parasitize a creature in a Terror form in such a short period of time was already considered amazing. However, the situation was too urgent. Zhou Wen still found it too slow.</p>
<p>In just a few days, a large number of dimensional creatures in the Seven Dragons Sea mutated. They possessed some of the characteristics of dragons and had grown to a certain level.</p>
<p>“Seven Seas, that’s enough. Let them step onto land and turn all the humans in the world into Dracotaurs.” The man ordered Seven Seas.</p>
<p>Shall I risk it? Zhou Wen wondered if he should go out and stop them, but on second thought, he gave up on the idea.</p>
<p>If he were to go out and risk his life now, the chances of reversing the situation were very low. The man had been ordering the Seven Seas Dragon King to control the marine dimensional creatures. It looked like he didn’t have such an ability.</p>
<p>Since the Seven Seas Dragon King is the key to controlling these dimensional creatures, as long as Primordial Spore can successfully parasitize it, I can completely reverse the situation. Since Feng Qiuyan and Qin Ling weren’t in danger for the time being, Zhou Wen decided to wait and see.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen told Miya about the situation outside and his judgment.</p>
<p>After Miya heard that, she heaved a sigh of relief. Since that man hadn’t killed Qin Ling, nothing else was that important to her.</p>
<p>“Although I don’t know what method that man used, I’m certain that those mutated creatures aren’t going ashore to eat humans. They probably are trying to infect humans with their mutated blood,” Miya said after some thought.</p>
<h3 id='chapter983'>Chapter 983: Alarmist</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The people from Sea Return City realized that something was amiss over the past few days. The dimensional zones on land were fine, but they couldn’t find any dimensional creatures in the dimensional zones in the sea.</p>
<p>All the dimensional creatures in the sea seemed to have vanished.</p>
<p>Sea God Reef, Undersea Blue Hole, Infinite Island, and other places were empty. There was almost no sign of dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>The Hui family had contacted all the families in Sea Return City to discuss a countermeasure. As for the Feng family, they were also troubled by Feng Qiuyan and Qin Ling’s disappearance. They had already sent people to search everywhere, but they were unable to find them.</p>
<p>“The situation in the Seven Dragons Sea is very strange. All the dimensional creatures have vanished. Everyone, let’s discuss. What does this mean?” Old Master Hui swept his gaze across the core members of the various families.</p>
<p>“The disappearance of dimensional creatures is a good thing for us. We don’t rely on dimensional zones in the sea to begin with. All we need to do is guard the dimensional zones and mineral deposits on the shore,” said Liu, a family head.</p>
<p>“That’s true, but I’m afraid that the dimensional creatures in the sea will cause trouble again,” an elder from the Feng family said.</p>
<p>“What can happen? After all, they are dimensional creatures in the sea. Only a small number of them have the ability to leave the sea to fight. Most of them will have their combat strength greatly reduced after they hit land. They won’t be a danger to us.” Family Head Liu paused before saying, “Besides, haven’t we already made preparations? Even if Sea Return City really can’t be defended, we can still retreat into the dimensional zones on land. Everyone has been in business here for so long. There shouldn’t be any problems, right?”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Brother Liu is right. Those things are from the sea after all. They can only circle the area before leaving. Do you think they can grow legs to snatch our territory?” another family head said.</p>
<p>Everyone immediately began discussing. Most people felt that they should stay behind and continue watching. Even if something really happened, it wouldn’t be too late to retreat when the time came.</p>
<p>“I think we should evacuate immediately.” A different voice sounded. Everyone looked at the person who spoke and saw a young man in his twenties. Most people knew that he was Hui Haifeng from the Hui family.</p>
<p>“Young Master Feng, what do you mean?” Family Head Liu asked Hui Haifeng.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng took out a small bottle and held it in his hand, allowing everyone to see what was inside.</p>
<p>The bottle wasn’t big, about the same size as a mineral water bottle. There was water inside, but there was something in the water that looked like a mushroom. It was similar to the test subjects he had shown Zhou Wen previously.</p>
<p>However, the thing that should have been white now suffused a faint golden color. It looked very strange.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” Old Master Hui asked Hui Haifeng.</p>
<p>He knew that Hui Haifeng was doing research, and he had supported him. However, he never expected Hui Haifeng to really figure out anything.</p>
<p>“Grandpa, this is a sample of the fungi I extracted from the marine plants to nurture. Originally, the evolution of these fungi took at least a year from a spore to its present state. However, this experimental product was something I just started cultivating this morning, but it has already evolved to such a level. Something must have happened in the Seven Dragons Sea. It’s very likely that the dimensional creatures in the sea will undergo a large-scale evolution, so we have to evacuate immediately,” Hui Haifeng said seriously.</p>
<p>“Young Master Feng, aren’t you being a little too assertive? Perhaps something went wrong with your experiment, or perhaps it’s just an anomaly. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything. Perhaps you need more experiments,” said Family Head Liu disapprovingly. He wasn’t interested in so-called scientific research.</p>
<p>He even felt that scientific research was useless in this era. It was the era of gods, and science was no longer feasible.</p>
<p>There were quite a number of people who thought that way. Furthermore, most people weren’t willing to give up on Sea Return City and the mineral deposits that they had been running for so many years.</p>
<p>After all, Hui Haifeng was only making an inference. No one knew if his inference would come true.</p>
<p>Even if it were true, it wouldn’t be too late to leave when they really couldn’t stop dimensional creatures. They still had dimensional zones operating on land as an escape route.</p>
<p>“Everyone, perhaps you don’t know what this evolutionary speed means. Let me make an analogy. According to the current evolutionary speed, if an ordinary rat is injected with this element, it will only need three days. In three days, it will evolve to have an elephant-like body and strength. If the creatures in the sea have such an evolutionary speed, are you still confident that you can safely retreat under their attacks? Do you still have the confidence to defend the dimensional zones?” Hui Haifeng said.</p>
<p>“Young Master Feng, this is only your speculation after all. You can’t just rely on your speculation to make us leave our homeland, right?” Family Head Liu pondered for a moment before saying, “Why don’t we do this? We’ll send some capable people into the water to investigate what has happened in the sea. If it’s really as you say, it won’t be too late for everyone to leave when the time comes.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. What Family Head Liu said makes sense. Let’s investigate first.” Many people supported Family Head Liu’s suggestion.</p>
<p>In the end, Hui Haifeng couldn’t convince them. After all, Sea Return City wasn’t under the jurisdiction of Hui Haifeng’s family. Furthermore, many people in the Hui family felt that Hui Haifeng was being overly alarmist.</p>
<p>In fact, many members of the Hui family disapproved of Hui Haifeng’s research.</p>
<p>If Hui Haifeng hadn’t paid for the research funding himself, they definitely wouldn’t have let him do so much.</p>
<p>“How was it?” Li Xuan asked Hui Haifeng after the meeting ended.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng shook his head and said, “It’s useless. They are blinded by interest and comfort. They won’t believe it unless they see the apocalypse with their own eyes.”</p>
<p>Li Xuan said gloomily, “Then what should we do? Old Zhou and Little Yanyan are missing. Something big must be happening.”</p>
<p>“Let’s return to the laboratory first. I need to make some preparations. We have to move the important things out first. We can’t stay here.” Hui Haifeng quickly rushed to the laboratory. He knew that he didn’t have much time left.</p>
<p>Li Xuan took Ya’er and returned with Hui Haifeng to make preparations.</p>
<p>At the same time, Sea Return City sent some humans with underwater abilities into the Seven Dragons Sea to investigate the disappearance of the dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>“What’s there to investigate? Isn’t this unnecessary? It’s better if the dimensional creatures in the sea leave. It saves us the trouble of them coming ashore to harass us every once in a while,” a middle-aged man said.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it all because of that scion from the Hui family? He said that there will be a huge mutation in the sea and that there will be many mutated dimensional creatures. It’s not like we haven’t seen them before. What’s there to be alarmed about? He even said that he wants us to move out of Sea Return. I think he’s studied too much and has lost his mind. What famous university? He’s ridiculous…”</p>
<p>The others laughed. They felt that a scion like Hui Haifeng only knew how to spout nonsense and give instructions blindly.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Suddenly, someone realized that there seemed to be something in the seawater ahead.</p>
<p>“Sea snakes? That’s not right. Why do they look like they have claws? The color isn’t right either. Sea snakes should be blue. This one looks blue with some gold in it…”</p>
<p>“It’s just a sea snake. Just kill it and bring it back for research.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Just as they were about to move, they suddenly saw the strange sea snake rush over. It was much faster than ordinary sea snakes. Before anyone could react, the sea snake had bitten him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter984'>Chapter 984: The Mutation Begins</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The people beside him rushed forward and immediately diced the strange sea snake into several pieces.</p>
<p>“Old Li, don’t be afraid. My Companion Beast can restrain the sea snake’s poison. I’ll treat your injuries now,” the person said as he summoned a Companion Beast to treat the bitten person.</p>
<p>He had treated poison wounds inflicted by sea snakes many times, so it wasn’t a problem.</p>
<p>Indeed, the wound was quickly healed without any signs of poisoning.</p>
<p>“Let’s go quickly. Let’s take a look ahead. If we can’t find anything, we should quickly return. Don’t waste time here. The dimensional creatures in the sea have little to do with us,” the few of them said as they continued diving deeper into the sea.</p>
<p>However, they didn’t realize that Old Li, who was behind them, gradually turned problematic. His eyes gradually turned golden, and tiny golden spots appeared on his face.</p>
<p>After a while, Old Li suddenly pounced on the person in front of him as though he had gone mad. He opened his mouth and bit down on the neck of the person in front of him.</p>
<p>“Ah!” The person was caught off guard and was bitten. He screamed and turned to look at Old Li, only to see that his pupils had turned completely golden.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>There were many guards at the Sea Return sentry post. They were still concerned about the mysterious disappearance of the dimensional creatures in the sea, but they were unwilling to leave Sea Return just like that.</p>
<p>In fact, most people could guess that something major had happened in the sea, but they were still hoping to get lucky.</p>
<p>“They’re back!” The guards on the sentry post discovered the people who had gone into the sea to investigate.</p>
<p>“One, two, three… Seven… No one is missing. I knew it. It’s all fine. Didn’t they return safely? If there’s really a huge mutation in the sea, how can they return safely?” the guard said in delight. He had been on tenterhooks the past two days, afraid that the mutation Hui Haifeng mentioned was real.</p>
<p>“Old Li, how’s the situation in the sea? Did you find any mutated creatures?” A few guards who were familiar with them greeted the people who had entered the sea.</p>
<p>However, Old Li and company didn’t speak. They walked over with their heads lowered.</p>
<p>“I’m asking you a question. Why aren’t you speaking?” a guard leader said unhappily.</p>
<p>When Old Li and company approached, they finally looked up. The guards shivered when they saw this and immediately shouted that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Old Li and company’s eyes were golden. Scales had grown on their faces, making them look terrifying and strange.</p>
<p>Just as they shouted, Old Li and the others bared their fangs and pounced forward. Instantly, the sentry post was in chaos as someone sent out a warning signal.</p>
<p>When the few families saw the warning signal, they were alarmed. They immediately organized their men to observe, but they didn’t discover any dimensional creatures on the coast. Their own people were attacking their own people at the sentry post.</p>
<p>The few families hurriedly led their men over to figure out what had happened. When they arrived, the last conscious guard was bitten on the neck by Old Li.</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned. They were also frightened by Old Li and the others. What was even more terrifying was that the guards who had fallen to the ground quickly got up again.</p>
<p>The eyes of the guards also began to turn golden. Golden spots appeared on their faces, but they hadn’t grown into scales.</p>
<p>An infection! This word popped up in everyone’s minds.</p>
<p>“Attack. Kill them all. We can’t let them live. It’s contagious,” Old Master Hui immediately ordered.</p>
<p>Only then did the frightened people react. No one dared to rush forward to fight them. Thankfully, there were enough people. They summoned their Companion Beasts and let them fight.</p>
<p>They were surprised to discover that Old Li and company’s bodies had become as hard as steel. Furthermore, they were terrifyingly fast. They felt nothing from ordinary injuries. Only by stabbing their hearts could they be killed. They no longer looked like humans, but more like dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Thankfully, their bodies became stronger, but their intelligence seemed to weaken. Finally, with everyone’s cooperation, they finally killed all the infected people.</p>
<p>“We can’t leave these corpses behind. Burn them all.” Just as Old Master Hui finished speaking, everyone looked at the sea. No one burned the corpses.</p>
<p>A storm suddenly stirred in the sea. And amidst the waves, something seemed to be surging.</p>
<p>Soon, they saw what it was. Countless dimensional creatures—shrimp, crabs, octopuses, sea snakes, and many strange creatures that they couldn’t name—rushed over alongside the waves. It was unknown how many there were.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that the dimensional creatures they were previously familiar with were now unrecognizable. The sea snakes and the sharks had grown claws. They rushed to the coast and bared their fangs as they charged at everyone.</p>
<p>“Retreat! Return to the city immediately! Everyone in the city retreat into the dimensional zone!” Old Master Hui’s expression changed drastically as he shouted.</p>
<p>Everyone’s faces were pale. The dimensional creatures that came surging over had exceeded their imagination. Apart from escaping, they no longer had any second thoughts.</p>
<p>Something even more terrifying happened. A large number of winged fish flew towards Sea Return City from the sky. The high wall was useless.</p>
<p>Sea Return City was in chaos. Some people’s bodies became strange after being injured by the dimensional creatures. Those with stronger bodies could still last for a period of time, while those with weaker bodies quickly turned golden. Golden spots began to appear on their skin.</p>
<p>“It’s over!” When Old Master Hui returned to the city, he saw that someone had already been infected.</p>
<p>Now, everyone was filled with regret. If they had known, they would have listened to Hui Haifeng and moved out of Sea Return City.</p>
<p>No matter how valuable the mineral deposits here were, people who died here wouldn’t have the life to enjoy them.</p>
<p>“Take refuge in the dimensional zones. Retreat immediately. Everyone retreat into the dimensional zones…” Old Master Hui shouted as he killed.</p>
<p>Now, it was only a flying fish invasion. There were many, but they were nothing compared to the dimensional creatures that rushed out from the coast.</p>
<p>Without Old Master Hui needing to shout, everyone was running for their lives. Instantly, Sea Return City seemed to turn into hell. There were screams and killing everywhere.</p>
<p>However, no one died. All the injured people would stand up after a while, but when they stood up, they would become members of the dimensional creature horde and not humans.</p>
<p>The few families fought as they retreated, gathering towards a dimensional zone. It was the dimensional zone they had been in for the longest time. They wanted to use the taboos in the dimensional zone to block these creatures.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Following a huge tsunami, a terrifying monster appeared. It looked like a huge octopus, but its tentacles were like wyrms. Each one was a hundred meters long.</p>
<p>All sorts of terrifying creatures charged forward with the terrifying monster blotting out the sky. The high walls were destroyed without putting up much of a defense.</p>

<p>The humans who wanted to leave Sea Return City suddenly realized that the way out of the city was blocked by dimensional creatures. The devil-like Seven Seas Dragon King blocked their path with large numbers of dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Dimensional creatures surged everywhere, surrounding Sea Return City tightly. It was almost impossible to escape.</p>
<p>“I should have…” Old Master Hui was extremely regretful. He knew that there might be danger, but he never expected that the entire city would fall. If he had listened to his grandson, Hui Haifeng, and ruthlessly abandoned his family business and left Sea Return City, he wouldn’t have ended up in such a state.</p>
<p>The only consolation was that the Hui family had already sent some of their descendants elsewhere to study. Although it was said that they were studying, it was actually to protect them. It could be considered a backup plan. If something really happened to Sea Return City, the Hui family wouldn’t be wiped out.</p>
<p>Sadly, because of Wang Mingyuan’s matter, Hui Haifeng had taken a leave of absence from school and returned home. The young man from the Hui family, who had the greatest hope of achieving something, was also going to die with the family.</p>
<p>At the thought of Hui Haifeng, Old Master Hui looked around, but he didn’t find him. He couldn’t help but feel a sliver of hope. Hui Haifeng had long expected a major mutation. Perhaps he had already left Sea Return.</p>
<p>Just as Old Master Hui was rejoicing, he realized that Hui Haifeng and a young man had charged over from the other side. The young man was carrying a girl who looked about two years old.</p>
<p>“Ah Feng, you already expected this to happen. Why haven’t you left!” Old Master Hui was furious and anxious when he saw Hui Haifeng charging over.</p>
<p>“The Hui family is all here. How can I leave alone? I have some things here that will be of some use to those dimensional creatures. Just apply some on your body. There’s too little time. This is all I’ve figured out,” Hui Haifeng said as he poured some powder from a bottle and handed it to Old Master Hui and company.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan, distribute it to the others.” Hui Haifeng handed a bottle to Li Xuan. Li Xuan responded and took the two Ice Silkworms over. Wherever the Ice Silkworms passed, they froze the dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Li Xuan wasn’t as gentle as Hui Haifeng. He directly scattered the powder on the people from Sea Return City. When the powder that resembled gold powder touched humans, the dimensional creatures seemed to treat them as their own kind and stopped attacking them.</p>
<p>Everyone was pleasantly surprised. There were dimensional creatures everywhere; it resembled a tidal wave. They originally thought that there was no hope, but to their surprise, divine help had descended from the heavens, allowing them to turn the situation around from certain death.</p>
<p>Soon, the people from Sea Return City were covered in the golden powder. A large number of dimensional creatures passed by them. At most, they only sniffed them and didn’t attack them.</p>
<p>It was the same for those who had mutated after being injured. They ignored the people who had been covered in gold powder.</p>
<p>Instantly, the huge Sea Return City was surrounded by countless dimensional creatures, but no battle happened.</p>
<p>“Everyone, walk slowly. Don’t worry.” Hui Haifeng heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that the gold powder was effective.</p>
<p>He had too little time. He didn’t have the time to do more research. He had only discovered by accident that once one was tainted with such special elements, the dimensional creatures would treat humans stained with the gold powder as their kind and stop attacking them.</p>
<p>Everyone followed Hui Haifeng as they silently traversed the sea of monsters. If it was just these monsters, Hui Haifeng might very well bring everyone out of danger.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this great chaos wasn’t just limited to dimensional creatures. There was also a human. Furthermore, he was the mastermind behind all of this.</p>
<p>Everyone was traversing the sea of monsters in fear when they suddenly saw a figure slowly land in the sky. It stood above the Seven Seas Dragon King and looked down at everyone in Sea Return City like a god.</p>
<p>A human? Hui Haifeng’s heart skipped a beat. At this moment, he wasn’t afraid of dimensional creatures, but humans.</p>
<p>Old Master Hui and the few elders of the Feng family were people who had seen many storms. When they saw the figure, their expressions changed drastically. Clearly, they had also realized the problem. They stopped and looked at the black-armored man on the Seven Seas Dragon King’s head.</p>
<p>“I never expected there to be such a keen-eyed person in Sea Return City. Not bad.” The person’s gaze looked at Hui Haifeng below as though he was praising him.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Hui Haifeng asked with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>“My name has long been abandoned. If you must have a title, call me Night Thearch,” the man said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Is the dimensional creature mutation in these seas related to you?” Hui Haifeng asked again.</p>
<p>“Consider it a gift from me. Do you like it?” Night Thearch said with a smile.</p>
<p>“You are also a human. Why are you doing this to us?” Family Head Liu said with a trembling voice.</p>
<p>Night Thearch didn’t answer. He didn’t even look at Family Head Liu. He continued looking at Hui Haifeng and said, “You should have already guessed my intentions, right? Why don’t you tell them?”</p>
<p>“You are evolving us, but it’s obvious that you failed. Those who are infected with this special element don’t even have self-awareness. Even if their bodies become stronger, it won’t be considered a successful evolution,” Hui Haifeng said.</p>
<p>Night Thearch smiled and said, “As expected, you know what’s happening. However, that view is still too narrow. Evolution is about survival of the fittest. Creatures that can’t adapt to evolution will ultimately be buried in the dust of history. My experiments didn’t fail, but most humans are too weak. Only true experts can be reborn in the tides of evolution and become even greater new humans.”</p>
<p>“You mean that this evolution has a certain success rate? Then what’s the success rate?” Hui Haifeng asked again.</p>
<p>“One in a thousand, or even lower, but it’s enough. It’s enough for the humans on Earth to have enough elites left. There’s no need to waste resources on defective products. They will be eliminated sooner or later anyway. I just sped up their elimination,” Night Thearch said casually.</p>
<p>However, when Hui Haifeng and company heard those words, they found him extremely cruel. Less than one in a thousand humans would survive; yet, such a massacre seemed trivial to Night Thearch.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from his words, not only did he set his sights on Sea Return City, but he also wanted to extend it for all of human society.</p>
<p>“Don’t you think this is too cruel to those who originally had a chance of survival?” Hui Haifeng asked.</p>
<p>“How can failure be cruel? It’s true cruelty to let useless people live numbly and waste resources that are useful in the hands of experts.” Night Thearch looked down at Hui Haifeng and said, “You’re not bad. If you are willing, you can become my right-hand man and create a new human order with me.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter986'>Chapter 986: True Mythical Strength</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Hui Haifeng took a deep breath. “Although we share similar beliefs, I’m sorry. We aren’t the same kind of people. I also want humans to evolve, but I won’t choose such a method.”</p>
<p>“You’re just fooling yourself. I know you want to say that you will figure out an evolution method with a high success rate, but what’s the point of having a high success rate? Even if everyone can become stronger because of a 100% success rate, there will still be strong and weak outcomes due to different talent. The strong will become stronger, and the weak will become weaker. When that happens, the strong will occupy most of the resources, but the weak will obtain fewer and fewer resources.”</p>
<p>Night Thearch sneered and said, “Just like how no matter how long workers work, capitalists will never find it enough. No matter how low the workers’ salary is, they will think that it’s too much. In order to squeeze out the last bit of remaining value, the weak will eventually die or even be killed by their powerful companions.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Instead of letting such a cruel thing happen and waste so much time, why don’t you let me complete this step directly? It will save time and also allow a genius like you to not have to think about how to snatch the last grain of rice from the weak in the future. Isn’t this a happy ending for everyone? If I’m guilty, let me bear these sins.”</p>
<p>Night Thearch’s eyes were firm and confident. Hui Haifeng knew that what he said wasn’t an excuse he had found for himself. He probably really believed what he said.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if the situation you mentioned will happen, but I still want to give it a try,” Hui Haifeng said.</p>
<p>“That’s a pity. I really hoped that you would stay and help me. It’s a pity. However, it’s fine. If you can survive this ordeal, even without my help, you can prove your excellence. When that happens, you will understand everything I’m saying.” As Night Thearch spoke, he waved his hand, gesturing for Seven Seas Dragon King to begin.</p>
<p>Seven Seas Dragon King raised its strange dragon-like tentacles and let out a silent roar. The dimensional creatures that had stopped attacking humans began surrounding the people of Sea Return City.</p>
<p>Everyone immediately fell into despair. Faced with the flood of dimensional creatures, their fighting spirit was long gone. They originally believed that they could rely on Hui Haifeng’s gold powder to escape, but death was still the outcome.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the dimensional creatures that were charging at the humans slowly stopped. Seven Seas Dragon King’s body trembled as though it was engaging in an intense battle of thoughts.</p>
<p>“Seven Seas, what happened?” Night Thearch frowned as he looked at Seven Seas Dragon King. Seven Seas Dragon King had actually disobeyed his orders.</p>
<p>Seven Seas Dragon King didn’t respond, but his trembling intensified. No matter how Night Thearch ordered it, it didn’t respond.</p>
<p>The dimensional creatures stopped, unsure of what to do.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ordered Primordial Spore to forcefully fight for control of Seven Seas Dragon King’s body from within.</p>
<p>Now, Primordial Spore hadn’t completely occupied the Seven Seas Dragon King’s soul, but there was no time. Zhou Wen could only make this choice.</p>
<p>Although Primordial Spore hadn’t completely occupied the soul, it had played a certain role. Seven Seas Dragon King was restrained, making it difficult for him to be of any use in a short period of time.</p>
<p>“There’s a problem!” Li Xuan looked at Seven Seas Dragon King who looked mentally ill and realized that something might have happened.</p>
<p>The people from Sea Return also looked at Seven Seas Dragon King eagerly. Now, their fates no longer belonged to them. Their life and death were in the hands of others. Although they knew that the chances were very low, they yearned for a miracle to happen.</p>
<p>“Come out.” Night Thearch seemed to realize something as a cold glint flashed in his eyes. He pressed a hand on the head of Seven Seas Dragon King and a strange electric force penetrated Seven Seas Dragon King’s body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt the horror of the force. He originally wanted to continue hiding, but now, he had no choice but to leave.</p>
<p>He pulled Miya out of Seven Seas Dragon King’s stomach and teleported out of his body. He arrived above Seven Seas Dragon King and looked at Night Thearch from afar.</p>
<p>The people from Sea Return City were alarmed. Another human had appeared above Seven Seas Dragon King. It looked like a young couple.</p>
<p>“I knew it. Old Zhou wouldn’t die so easily.” Li Xuan didn’t find it strange when he saw Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“You aren’t dead?” Night Thearch was slightly surprised. He originally imagined that Zhou Wen had been devoured by Seven Seas Dragon King, but he never expected him to survive.</p>
<p>“Night Thearch, it’s best you stop. The Seven Seas Dragon King no longer obeys your orders. It’s impossible for your plan to continue,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Night Thearch said indifferently, “Your strength isn’t enough to affect Seven Seas Dragon King. I believe you relied on a Companion Beast to influence it. As long as I kill you, your Companion Beast will die with you. Seven Seas Dragon King will naturally recover.”</p>
<p>“Many people have wanted to kill me, but they failed in the end. I don’t think it’s easy,” Zhou Wen said as he shot a look at Miya.</p>
<p>Miya nodded and immediately turned around to fly towards the sea.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already discussed it with her. She was in charge of rescuing Qin Ling and Feng Qiuyan while Zhou Wen was in charge of holding back Night Thearch.</p>
<p>Night Thearch saw through their plan at a glance, but he didn’t stop Miya. This was because there was no need. As long as Zhou Wen was killed, everything would return to normal.</p>
<p>“Wang Mingyuan is quite a figure. I never expected the disciples he taught to be such figures as well. Unfortunately, firstly, you didn’t fuse with a Guardian like Wang Mingyuan, and secondly, you didn’t contract a Guardian. You have no right to be my opponent,” Night Thearch said as he slowly raised his hand.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing impressive having Guardians. I’ve killed a few too,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid the Guardians you killed can’t even transform into a Terror form, right?” Night Thearch raised his right hand high and slashed down like a blade. At the same time, he said, “Today, I’ll let you see what true Mythical power is.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen quickly retreated, hoping to dodge Night Thearch’s attack, but Night Thearch’s strike didn’t produce any ordinary Essence Energy or light.</p>
<p>The sky suddenly darkened, plunging the entire world into darkness. One couldn’t see their fingers, nor could they see anything else. Night Thearch’s figure had also vanished.</p>
<p>“What is terror? The unknown and the invisible are the true terrors. You can’t see or touch a true Terror-grade powerhouse. As long as I’m willing, I can take your life at any time. This is a true god. It’s irresistible and impossible to compete…” Night Thearch’s voice echoed in the boundless darkness. He seemed to be everywhere, but he didn’t seem to be anywhere at the same time.</p>
<p>v</p>
<h3 id='chapter987'>Chapter 987: Two Choices</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The entire Sea Return City fell into darkness. Everyone seemed to become blind as the terror in their hearts was magnified countless times.</p>
<p>Even Epic experts with eyesight abilities couldn’t see anything in the darkness. There was only darkness, like an eternal night.</p>
<p>The average people of the city were used to using their eyes. They were already very flustered losing their vision. They thought of the countless monsters around them, but were unable to see them and did not know what they were doing. Were they preparing to pounce over and devour them? Had the dimensional creatures’ bloody mouths reached their necks?</p>
<p>The terror humans felt mostly came from their own imagination. And this dark environment was the easiest environment to seed terror in their imaginations.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t like to imagine things, so when he used Truth Listener, he also activated the Supreme Hell King Life Soul, allowing his senses to become extremely sharp.</p>
<p>However… it was useless… Be it Truth Listener’s ability or Supreme Hell King’s enhanced senses, he failed to discover any traces of Night Thearch. It was as though Night Thearch had already melted into the night.</p>
<p>“Have you… experienced true terror?” Night Thearch’s voice sounded in Zhou Wen’s ear.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t see Night Thearch. As for the darkness, it seemed to transform into a saber that brushed past Zhou Wen’s neck.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The Astral Shell Dragon Armor appeared on Zhou Wen’s body as he activated Absolute Defense. Even so, a thin mark appeared on his armored neck.</p>
<p>“Absolute Defense. This should be a manifestation of the Astral Shell Dragon Companion Egg, right? You are really lucky. Although the Astral Shell Dragon’s abilities aren’t much, Absolute Defense is an extremely powerful skill. Even at the Terror grade, it won’t be easy to break through Absolute Defense.”</p>
<p>Night Thearch’s voice drifted over from somewhere. It was as though his lips were right beside Zhou Wen’s left ear as he spoke, but when Zhou Wen turned his head, he saw nothing.</p>
<p>The voice sounded in Zhou Wen’s right ear again. “Absolute Defense is among the top Mythical powers. Previously, I wanted to personally kill the Astral Shell Dragon to see if a Companion Egg would drop. However, the chances were too low, so I had no choice but to give up. I never expected you to obtain the Astral Shell Dragon Companion Egg. Unfortunately, the Astral Shell Dragon is only a Mythical creature with no potential. It can’t enter the Terror state and can’t have Absolute Defense constantly activated. It can only last for half an hour at most.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned his head to the right, but he still didn’t see anything.</p>
<p>“Half an hour. This is the amount of time you have to live in this world. Enjoy it. No, it’s already been a minute. You still have 29 minutes…” Night Thearch’s evil voice entered Zhou Wen’s ears like a devil.</p>
<p>Faced with the pressure of death, especially knowing the time when he might die, the pressure and terror was enough to make one break down.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t a sentimental person. He knew that Absolute Defense couldn’t protect him forever. Instead of being afraid, he should think about what to do next.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen’s first thought was to run.</p>
<p>Half an hour was enough for him to teleport far away, but in the darkness, Zhou Wen teleported several times. He had already left Sea Return City, but all he saw was darkness.</p>
<p>All the mountains and rivers were in the darkness. They could be heard but couldn’t be seen.</p>
<p>“Do you want to leave? I can let you leave.” Night Thearch’s voice sounded in Zhou Wen’s ear again. It was so close that it made his hair stand on end.</p>
<p>After Night Thearch said that, light returned to where Zhou Wen was.</p>
<p>However, it was still dark inside Sea Return City.</p>
<p>This scene was unbelievable. It was daytime on Zhou Wen’s side, but the city several meters away was pitch-black.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you want to escape? You can leave now, but the people here will become my test subjects and experience that one in a thousand possibility. I wonder if there’s anyone you care about among them? However, no matter how much you care about them, it’s not as important as your life, right?” Night Thearch’s voice sounded from the darkness.</p>
<p>In the darkness, Night Thearch appeared beside Hui Haifeng like a nightmare. Hui Haifeng felt his eyes light up. He could actually see clearly in the darkness. He threw a punch, but Night Thearch’s body was like a dark shadow. Hui Haifeng’s fist passed through, failing to harm him at all.</p>
<p>Night Thearch smiled and said, “What do you think Zhou Wen will choose? He and you are fellow disciples, right? Can your friendship exceed the terror of death?”</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng said calmly, “I wish for him to leave. With his abilities, he will definitely be able to defeat you in the future. He just needs to avenge us.”</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng didn’t shout for Zhou Wen to leave because he knew that those words would only excite stir feelings. He didn’t need Zhou Wen to become sentimental.</p>
<p>“How touching.” Night Thearch came to Li Xuan and Ya’er’s side again. They immediately had the ability to see in the darkness.</p>
<p>“Do you think Zhou Wen will leave this place or come back to save you?” Night Thearch asked with interest.</p>
<p>Without a word, Li Xuan released the Ice Silkworms. However, the Ice Silkworms passed through the shadow-like Night Thearch and failed to cause any damage to him.</p>
<p>“How interesting. Don’t you wish for him to come back and save you? Don’t tell me that you really don’t care about him abandoning you and escaping? You once treated him as your best friend and best companion, but he escaped alone when there’s danger. How sad is that?” Night Thearch’s voice sounded in the trio’s ears.</p>
<p>“If it were me, I would definitely come back to save you, even if it means sharing life and death. What would Zhou Wen choose?” Night Thearch continued.</p>
<p>Outside Sea Return City, Zhou Wen stared at the dark Sea Return City with a frown.</p>
<p>“Are you escaping or not? I’ll give you three more seconds. If you don’t want to escape, return to the darkness.” Night Thearch’s voice came from the darkness again. “One… Two… Three…”</p>
<p>When Night Thearch counted to three, Zhou Wen turned around and quickly vanished.</p>
<p>In the dark Sea Return City, Night Thearch gloated as he said to Hui Haifeng and company, “What a pity. It looks like your companion is half unreliable. Between living and your friendship, he chose to live.”</p>
<p>Li Xuan looked at the depressed Ya’er in his arms and suddenly said, “So what?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you feel abandoned at all?” Night Thearch said with interest.</p>
<p>“Of course. Old Zhou is a bastard. I wish I could tear him to pieces, but unfortunately, I might not have such a chance.” Li Xuan stroked Ya’er’s head and said, “Zhou Wen is a bastard like me. If it were just the few of us here, he definitely wouldn’t have returned. However, there’s still the little princess he cares about the most here, so he will definitely return. Don’t you agree, Ya’er?”</p>
<p>Ya’er was stunned. The disappointment on her face gradually disappeared. Her eyes became resolute as she nodded heavily.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan.” Hui Haifeng frowned slightly.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan waved his hand. “I know what you mean, but a bastard knows a bastard the best. Compared to letting others know that he will return, he cares more about Ya’er’s feelings. There are some things we understand, but Ya’er is still young. We can’t leave her with a psychological trauma. Even if she dies, she should die happily.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter988'>Chapter 988: Battling Night Thearch</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“You actually think that he will return?” Night Thearch was intrigued.</p>
<p>Human nature couldn’t withstand tests. Night Thearch believed that it was impossible for Zhou Wen to return when facing death.</p>
<p>Night Theach wanted to see Li Xuan, Hui Haifeng, and company’s disappointed expressions, so he wasn’t in a rush to get the dimensional creatures to attack. He wanted Li Xuan and company to slowly experience the process of going from hope to disappointment before going from disappointment to despair.</p>
<p>However, not long after, Night Thearch suddenly realized that a figure was rapidly approaching Sea Return City from afar. The figure was none other than Zhou Wen, who had returned.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hadn’t really fled previously. He only wanted to test if Night Thearch would really let him go or if there was some other scheme.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen confirmed that he had really escaped and that Night Thearch hadn’t chased after him, he returned.</p>
<p>Li Xuan, Hui Haifeng, and Ya’er were trapped inside. Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to give up when he still had the ability to do something.</p>
<p>Ya’er was delighted when she saw Zhou Wen fly back.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng and Li Xuan wore heavy expressions. Zhou Wen’s return meant that they were going to risk their lives. No matter what they did, no matter how trivial it was, as long as they could play some unimportant role in the battle, they would work hard.</p>
<p>“Why are you back?” Night Thearch asked Zhou Wen with interest.</p>
<p>“I left something here. I came back to take it away,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“What did you leave here?” Night Thearch asked.</p>
<p>“People in Sea Return City,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Are you referring to your family and friends?” Night Thearch asked.</p>
<p>“No, everyone in Sea Return City,” Zhou Wen said seriously.</p>
<p>“Are you testing my patience?” Night Thearch’s voice turned cold. With his voice turning cold, darkness once again devoured the area outside Sea Return City.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt his body sink into the darkness again and Night Thearch seemed to be everywhere, existing in every corner of the darkness, but Zhou Wen didn’t panic at all.</p>
<p>Since he had dared to return, he had naturally come back with a plan. Regardless of whether it was effective or not, he wanted to give it a try.</p>
<p>“Absolute Defense can only last for half an hour at most, but that’s only in theory. Under a powerful attack, due to excessive expenditure, Absolute Defense can only last for an even shorter period of time. If I attack with all my might, you might die in less than ten minutes. To be honest, I don’t wish for that to happen,” said Night Thearch.</p>
<p>“You can give it a try and see if you can kill me in ten minutes.” Zhou Wen seemed to be confident, showing no fear of Night Thearch’s threat.</p>
<p>“I originally didn’t want to kill you, but since you have a death wish, it’s difficult for me to retain someone who’s bound to die.” As Night Thearch spoke, the phantom-like figure seemed to vanish. Zhou Wen’s Truth Listener could no longer hear any information related to Night Thearch.</p>
<p>Now, I have to think of a way to break through the darkness and find Night Thearch’s true body before Astral Dragon Armor Dragon’s Absolute Defense expires. Otherwise, I won’t even be able to touch Night Thearch’s true body. There’s no way to kill or severely injure him.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>Night Thearch couldn’t be seen, but the blades that resembled the night sky strangely appeared everywhere. They were like invisible blades of darkness that sliced at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body retreated repeatedly from the slash, but he couldn’t see where Night Thearch was. He was like a ghost in the darkness, omnipresent, yet without a corporeal body. He couldn’t be found no matter how Zhou Wen searched.</p>
<p>Even if it’s a Terror-grade creature, it’s impossible for it to be without a body. Be it the ice maiden or the Yin Talisman King, they both have their true bodies. Night Thearch definitely has a true body. I just haven’t found it. Where is he? Zhou Wen used Truth Listener and listened to the surroundings again, but he still failed to discover anything. Even when Night Thearch attacked him, Zhou Wen couldn’t sense his existence.</p>
<p>How does he do it? Zhou Wen couldn’t figure it out, so he could only make attempts.</p>
<p>The invisible saber in the darkness slashed at Zhou Wen’s back again. Without looking back, Zhou Wen summoned a sword and slashed behind him.</p>
<p>The sword that carried flames was the Bronze Sparrow Sword that he had recently obtained.</p>
<p>The flames produced by the Bronze Sparrow Sword illuminated Zhou Wen’s surroundings, but it was limited in range. It was still pitch-black further away.</p>
<p>The light from the flames didn’t completely banish the darkness, nor did it help Zhou Wen find Night Thearch. A strange black palm shadow rushed out of Zhou Wen’s shadow and slashed at his thigh.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Astral Shell Dragon’s armor blocked the strike. Otherwise, Zhou Wen’s leg would have been severed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body streaked through the darkness. Although he was protected by Absolute Defense and he couldn’t really be injured, the pain in his leg made him clearly aware that the effects of Absolute Defense were weakening.</p>
<p>It was undoubtedly dangerous to fight an invisible, untouchable enemy who could hurt him. Furthermore, the enemy could kill one of his own at any time.</p>
<p>Although this strike wasn’t effective, it didn’t mean that it was really useless. At the very least, Zhou Wen had discovered that the light emitted by the flames was somewhat effective against the darkness.</p>
<p>However, the range that Mythical flames could illuminate was only three feet away from the Bronze Sparrow Sword. It was a very limited range of illumination.</p>
<p>Also, Night Thearch seemed only capable of traveling in the darkness. That strike just now was an attack launched from the shadows produced by the light.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen attempted to use the Bronze Sparrow Sword to attack from a different direction, but he naturally failed to injure Night Thearch. However, he was certain that Night Thearch had to be in the darkness to deliver his omnipresent attacks. He couldn’t appear in the light.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was roughly certain that even if Night Thearch could attack in the light, he would definitely be unable to hide his body.</p>
<p>If he wanted to defeat Night Thearch, he had to place him in the light.</p>
<p>However, the Bronze Sparrow Sword’s flames weren’t enough to illuminate all parts of Zhou Wen’s body. Even if it was bright enough, there would be shadows. With shadows, there would be darkness. Night Thearch could still attack Zhou Wen through the shadows.</p>
<p>External light is useless my body can glow. This doesn’t seem difficult for me. Zhou Wen thought of his Life Soul, Primordial Human Sovereign.</p>
<p>As long as he fused with the Primordial Human Sovereign, he could transform into a humanoid sun. He didn’t know how far the Primordial Human Sovereign’s light could illuminate.</p>
<p>However, even if it was only a foot away, it would be enough. In a situation where there were no blind spots in the darkness, Zhou Wen should be able to see Night Thearch’s true body once he entered a one-foot radius to attack.</p>

<p>“Absolute Defense is indeed a very powerful ability. Unfortunately, if the Companion Beast that possesses it is at the Terror grade, it can be considered Absolute Defense in the absolute sense of the word. This ability is a waste on the Astral Shell Dragon. Now, that armor can’t even last a minute. Once Absolute Defense completely fails, it will be the end of your life.” Night Thearch’s demonic voice sounded in the darkness again, but his attacks never stopped.</p>
<p>“Perhaps that might spell the end of your life,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>“I’m very curious. What gives you the confidence? Apart from the Astral Shell Dragon, what other trump cards do you have? Why don’t you take them all out and let me see what power you can rely on?” Night Thearch was really curious.</p>
<p>From the moment Zhou Wen returned, Night Thearch was already rather interested in him. He didn’t underestimate Zhou Wen. On the contrary, after Zhou Wen really returned, he placed an elevated importance on him.</p>
<p>However, Night Thearch was still curious to know what Zhou Wen’s return was banking on.</p>
<p>Even so, Night Thearch didn’t relinquish the chance of killing Zhou Wen just because of his curiosity. He would still kill Zhou Wen the moment the Shell Dragon armor failed. Therefore, he hoped to see Zhou Wen’s trump card before that.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The Shell Dragon armor suffered another attack. This time, the Shell Dragon armor was sliced open by the blade condensed from darkness. It was so deep that even Zhou Wen’s bones could be seen. Blood flowed out of the wound.</p>
<p>“This is your last chance…” As Night Thearch launched another attack, his voice entered Zhou Wen’s ears.</p>
<p>Once the Shell Dragon armor was destroyed, Absolute Defense would be useless. Night Thearch could enter Zhou Wen’s body through the ruptured wound and kill him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew very well that this was indeed his last chance. If he couldn’t withstand this strike, he would probably die here.</p>
<p>In Sea Return City, only Li Xuan, Hui Haifeng, and Ya’er received special treatment from Night Thearch. They could see everything.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Zhou Wen bleed, the three of them became nervous. They wanted to rush over to help, but it was as though they were separated by a strange distance. No matter how they charged towards the battle, they were unable to reach it. It was as though they were stuck in place.</p>
<p>Almost at the instant Night Thearch attacked, Zhou Wen changed his Life Soul and fused the Primordial Human Sovereign Life Soul with himself.</p>
<p>Instantly, Zhou Wen’s body turned into a humanoid sun. The area he illuminated was greater than he imagined. It was even bigger than the Mythical Flaming Sword.</p>
<p>And just inches away from Zhou Wen was where Night Thearch stood. With his fingers on one hand stretched out, he stabbed at Zhou Wen’s wound like a sword. There were cracks in his armor that provided zero defense.</p>
<p>They saw it. They finally saw it. It wasn’t just Zhou Wen. Li Xuan, Hui Haifeng, and company also saw Night Thearch’s true body appear in the light.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen threw the Bronze Sparrow Sword out.</p>
<p>That’s right. It wasn’t a stab, but a throw. This was a Mythical skill, Vajra Drill. It was a skill that sacrificed weapons to unleash the strongest attack.</p>
<p>With the augmentation of Vajra Drill, the power that erupted from this strike was equivalent to the combined strength of Zhou Wen and the Bronze Sparrow Sword. Its speed was unimaginably fast as the Bronze Sparrow Sword stabbed into Night Thearch’s body before immediately exploding.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Flames erupted like a sun flare. A Mythical weapon instantly erupted all its energy. The destructive power it produced was unimaginable.</p>
<p>The darkness that enveloped Sea Return City finally vanished as everyone regained their vision. Apart from Li Xuan and a few others, no one knew what had happened.</p>
<p>When their vision recovered, they saw Zhou Wen floating in the air like a sun god and the intense explosion of light.</p>
<p>Has the terrifying Night Thearch been killed? He should be dead. Even Mythical creatures can’t survive such a terrifying explosion. Everyone prayed for this outcome.</p>
<p>However, when the light from the explosion gradually dissipated, they realized that Night Thearch was standing there unharmed. His long black hair was still flowing as before, as though he wasn’t injured at all.</p>
<p>“You’re really impressive. You have more than one Life Soul, and it’s so powerful. You were actually able to reveal my true body in the Night of Terror. Unfortunately, although your strike is extremely powerful, one that would have probably halved the lives of any Mythical creature even if they didn’t die, to a Terror-grade creature, it’s useless no matter how strong it is. Only a Terror-grade power can defeat a Terror-grade. You are still too weak,” Night Thearch said as he walked towards Zhou Wen. He no longer had any curiosity after seeing Zhou Wen’s trump card. He had no regrets killing Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen touched the scabbard in his left hand and condensed the Bronze Sparrow Sword again.</p>
<p>Weapons that were destroyed by Vajra Drill typically vanished. However, because the Bronze Sparrow Sword had the ability to be reborn in the scabbard, it didn’t really vanish. It was also the best weapon to use with Vajra Drill in reality.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen once again threw out the Bronze Sparrow Sword with Vajra Drill. Night Thearch didn’t dodge as he reached out to grab the flying Bronze Sparrow Sword, causing it to explode in his hand.</p>
<p>It was useless. That body was like a divine body that wouldn’t be injured by mortal powers. No matter how terrifying the power unleashed by the Bronze Sparrow Sword was, it couldn’t injure Night Thearch at all.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen threw out the Bronze Sparrow Sword again and again, but it was like setting off fireworks.</p>
<p>Is he a god? The people from Sea Return City were dumbfounded as irresistible terror arose in their hearts. Under such a terrifying explosion, he wasn’t injured at all. He was no different from a god.</p>
<p>Night Thearch was slightly disappointed because the Night of Terror was useless against Zhou Wen. He didn’t activate it again as he destroyed everything with a wave of his hand. He arrived in front of Zhou Wen and didn’t even give him a chance to draw his sword. He struck Zhou Wen’s head with one hand, hoping to completely end his life.</p>
<p>With Absolute Defense completely nullified, it was impossible for Zhou Wen to withstand this strike.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s right hand still moved. However, this time, he didn’t pull out the Bronze Sparrow Sword with his right hand, nor did he use Vajra Drill again.</p>
<p>An ice-blue dragon tooth that resembled a sapphire appeared in Zhou Wen’s right hand before disappearing with the use of Darkness Right Hand.</p>
<p>It was so fast that no one saw his actions. When everyone saw what happened, they saw that the ice-blue dragon tooth in Zhou Wen’s hand had already penetrated Night Thearch’s chest.</p>
<h3 id='chapter990'>Chapter 990: Terror versus Terror</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Night Thearch looked down at his chest and saw blood slowly flowing along the ice-blue dragon teeth.</p>
<p>“Ice Dragon King’s Tooth…” Night Thearch’s face instantly turned extremely pale.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen released the dragon tooth. His palm that held the dragon tooth had already frozen. If he continued holding it, his palm and armor would probably be frozen to pieces.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that only a Terror-grade can injure a Terror-grade? As you wish.” Zhou Wen pulled out an ice dragon rib with his left hand and slashed at Night Thearch again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also wanted to use Doctor Darkness’s Darkness Right Hand with his right hand again, but his right hand was already numb from the cold. He couldn’t raise it at all.</p>
<p>The power of a Terror-grade was too terrifying. Just holding the dragon tooth for an attack was already unbearable for his palm, so he could only switch to his left hand.</p>
<p>Although his left hand wasn’t as good as Darkness Right Hand, it was augmented by Doctor Darkness’s Golden Left Hand. His Speed and Strength were much stronger.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen’s strike was using the Immortal Slaying thanks to Slaughterer. It was unbelievably fast. With a flash, he crossed paths with Night Thearch.</p>
<p>As he switched his Life Soul, the sun-like light vanished, revealing Zhou Wen’s true appearance. As for Night Thearch’s arm, it had been sliced off by Zhou Wen. However, Night Thearch vanished like a phantom without a trace, leaving only an arm and the dragon tooth that had stabbed into his chest.</p>
<p>He actually managed to escape? Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed, but he didn’t chase after him. His left hand was already suffering from frostbite, so it was impossible for him to use the ice dragon’s parts with his hands.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after dealing Immortal Slaying, he had expended all his strength. He might not be able to gain an advantage even if he succeeded in chasing after him.</p>
<p>The people from Sea Return City didn’t know Zhou Wen’s present situation. Seeing him easily injure the god-like Night Thearch and even sever one of his arms, they looked at him with reverent eyes.</p>
<p>“Let them retreat to the sea,” Zhou Wen said to the Seven Seas Dragon King.</p>
<p>Although the Seven Seas Dragon King’s consciousness hadn’t been completely parasitized, its resistance suddenly weakened after Night Thearch escaped. Primordial Spore had the upper hand.</p>
<p>It was still difficult to destroy the Seven Seas Dragon King’s consciousness, but some simple control was enough.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s order, the seven strange dragon-like tentacles of the Seven Seas Dragon King roared at the sky. The mutated marine dimensional creatures retreated into the Seven Dragons Sea like the tide.</p>
<p>Seeing a powerful dimensional creature like the Seven Seas Dragon King listen to Zhou Wen’s orders, everyone’s expressions turned even odder. They found it unbelievable that he was only a human youth.</p>
<p>In particular, many people from the Hui and Feng families recognized Zhou Wen. They knew that he was Hui Haifeng and Feng Qiuyan’s classmate, so their expressions were even stranger.</p>
<p>Back when Feng Qiuyan mentioned Zhou Wen to his family elders, he even said that Zhou Wen had taught him many things. Back then, the Feng family thought nothing of it.</p>
<p>Now, from their point of view, Feng Qiuyan was extremely lucky to be able to learn from Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was afraid that Night Thearch would return to the underwater palace to cause trouble for Miya and company, so he landed on the Seven Seas Dragon King’s head and spoke to Li Xuan and Hui Haifeng. “I’m heading to the underwater abyss to take a look. Do you want to come with me?”</p>
<p>“We’ll go with you.” Li Xuan chased after him with Ya’er in his arms. Hui Haifeng also boarded the Seven Seas Dragon King.</p>
<p>The Seven Seas Dragon King reluctantly headed for the sea and quickly vanished in the raging waves.</p>
<p>“Old Master Hui, are we still leaving Sea Return City?” Family Head Liu walked to Old Master Hui and asked.</p>
<p>The others also looked at Old Master Hui eagerly. Although they usually let Old Master Hui take the lead, they were clearly more respectful now.</p>
<p>Old Master Hui knew very well that the reason they were so reverent wasn’t because he was the head of the Hui family, but because of Hui Haifeng and Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t know if Zhou Wen had called Hui Haifeng along on purpose or not, it had undoubtedly helped the Hui family greatly. In the future, it would be much more convenient for the Hui family to handle matters in Sea Return City, especially matters related to Hui Haifeng.</p>
<p>As for Hui Haifeng’s previous research results, everyone saw its potential and possibilities. They no longer dared to underestimate him. If not for Hui Haifeng’s gold powder, they would have long been infected. They wouldn’t have had the chance to wait for Zhou Wen’s appearance.</p>
<p>The Feng family was also secretly doing the math. Zhou Wen’s relationship with Feng Qiuyan wasn’t any weaker than his relationship with Hui Haifeng. They felt like they could do something.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to leave for the time being, but the situation is unpredictable. Everyone should return and pack up. Leave and think of backup plans for the family,” Old Master Hui said ambiguously.</p>
<p>Many people strongly agreed with his words. They were in a rush to escape. Previously, they hadn’t been able to take their possessions with them. Now, they could return to take them. They had to slowly transfer the family assets away. Even if they could stay in Sea Return, they couldn’t treat this place as their foundation.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen and company arrived at the underwater abyss, they saw Miya return with Qin Ling and Feng Qiuyan. They were fine, having only been imprisoned in the palace by Night Thearch.</p>
<p>Miya had finally broken through the power that sealed them and saved them.</p>
<p>“Night Thearch is a strange person. He can be considered vicious for trivializing the murder of billions of people, but he didn’t kill us despite having so many chances,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“It’s true that we can’t treat him as simply a bad person, but sometimes, such people are even more terrifying than bad people.” Zhou Wen paused before saying, “We still have to think of a way to resolve Qin Ling’s problem. Otherwise, Night Thearch will eventually make a comeback.”</p>
<p>“If I’m not wrong, the source of those marine mutated creatures should be her, right?” Hui Haifeng said as he sized up Qin Ling.</p>
<p>Qin Ling nodded slightly. “I’m sorry for implicating everyone.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to say that. You’re not at fault. The one at fault is this era.” Hui Haifeng thought for a moment and said, “If you believe me, you must give me some time. With my research, I might be able to resolve the problem with you and stop Night Thearch from seeking you out again.”</p>
<p>Qin Ling looked at Hui Haifeng in puzzlement before looking at Feng Qiuyan and Miya.</p>
<p>“Senior Hui has done a lot of research on biological mutations. Let him give it a try. Perhaps he really can succeed. Even if he can’t, things can’t get any worse,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Li Xuan still trusted in Hui Haifeng’s character.</p>
<p>“If you trust us, you can let Senior give it a try,” Zhou Wen added.</p>
<p>When Qin Ling saw Feng Qiuyan and Miya nod slightly, she bowed at Hui Haifeng. “I really don’t know how to repay you.”</p>
<p>“If it really succeeds, taking good care of our Junior Feng will be considered the best payment,” Hui Haifeng said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that Hui Haifeng had the confidence for him to say that, but he didn’t know what he was going to do.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know much about this, so he couldn’t help much. All he wanted to do was head to Night Thearch’s abyssal palace to see if there was anything there.</p>
<p>After finding so many ice dragon objects, there might be something similar in the deep-sea palace.</p>
<h3 id='chapter991'>Chapter 991: King of Earth</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The palace in the deep sea was now empty. Ordinary dimensional creatures didn’t dare approach it. Of Night Thearch and the Seven Seas Dragon King, who lived here, one had fled while the Primordial Spore controlled most of the other’s autonomy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen searched the entire palace, but he failed to find anything.</p>
<p>There were only some daily necessities and equipment here. It looked like this palace was more like a place that Night Thearch used for research.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in the research data and equipment here, but Hui Haifeng treated them like treasures.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to help him transport the equipment and data back. Although Hui Haifeng’s research direction was similar to Night Thearch’s, Hui Haifeng wasn’t as radical. The results he could produce wouldn’t be as unreliable as Night Thearch’s.</p>
<p>Without any results to speak of, Zhou Wen went to the Seven Seas Dragon King’s nest to take a look. This time, he discovered the blue glacier.</p>
<p>When he dug it out, he saw something that looked like a fingernail. It was very likely the tip of a dragon claw.</p>
<p>This discovery delighted Zhou Wen. He wasn’t a match for a Terror-grade creature yet, but with these Terror-grade items, he had a chance of injuring or even killing them. Therefore, Zhou Wen treated them like treasures.</p>
<p>Thinking that he hadn’t been to Infinite Island where Dragon Granny resided, Zhou Wen went there and found another terrifying item that looked like a dragon’s whisker.</p>
<p>The seven dragon monarchs and Dragon Sea Dragon King’s nests have the Ice Dragon King’s Terror items. If Night Thearch killed the Ice Dragon King, why did he place these things in the seven dragon monarchs’ nests? Why didn’t he collect them himself or destroy them directly? Zhou Wen was extremely puzzled.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t found the Ice Dragon King’s Terror items, it would have been difficult for him to injure Night Thearch, and he might not have been able to stop him.</p>
<p>Inside the empty underwater palace, Zhou Wen took out all the Ice Dragon King items—tooth, bone, scale, horn, whisker, claw, eye, and hair.</p>
<p>These were all parts of the Ice Dragon King, but they were not complete. They were only a very small portion.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could clearly sense that there was a vague connection among the Ice Dragon King’s Terror items, but this connection was extremely weak and didn’t have much effect.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, there’s something missing? Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that the eight items weren’t complete.</p>
<p>The completeness Zhou Wen mentioned wasn’t referring to the Ice Dragon King’s body, but the eight items when placed together felt like something was missing.</p>
<p>The Thearch said that even a Terror-grade creature will find it difficult to revive after death, but just because it’s difficult doesn’t mean it’s impossible. I think there’s something wrong with these items. Otherwise, it would be impossible for Night Thearch to place them in different places. He could have kept them for himself. Zhou Wen wondered if there was another item that belonged to the Ice Dragon King in Night Thearch’s hands. Perhaps it was the most important one.</p>
<p>Ordinary creatures didn’t dare touch Terror items, much less carry them on their bodies. However, Night Thearch was naturally different. He was already at the Terror grade, so there shouldn’t be any problems.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t know where Night Thearch had gone. Zhou Wen didn’t wish to see him again, much less snatch the item in his possession.</p>
<p>In the next few days, Hui Haifeng did some research work. At the same time, he obtained information about Night Thearch. This information and equipment made Hui Haifeng more confident in solving Qin Ling’s problem.</p>
<p>He had already begun making preparations. He believed that they would be completed soon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t understand any of that. When he was bored, he looked at the cube’s ranking and realized that the top ten had already been occupied by Guardians.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there were already fourteen Guardians on the rankings. During this period of time, there were more and more Guardians on the rankings. It looked like they all wanted to use this ranking battle to defeat their opponents.</p>
<p>Ranked first was still Ya. The second was still Great Skyfiend whom Ya had defeated. The third was Fairy Burial.</p>
<p>Following that were some Guardians that Zhou Wen had never seen before. Their names looked very powerful. There was also a fellow named Metal Reaper. Zhou Wen looked at his projection and realized that the Guardian was like a metal robot. It looked like it had explosive combat strength.</p>
<p>For some reason, Starry Night, who was previously ranked very high, had fallen to tenth place and barely maintained its top-ten standing.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen searched for Starry Night online and realized that a Guardian had challenged Starry Night previously, but Starry Night didn’t accept the challenge. Its ranking automatically dropped.</p>
<p>After a few consecutive challenges, Starry Night didn’t accept any of them and quickly fell to tenth place.</p>
<p>The reason Zhou Wen paid more attention to Starry Night was because he felt that Starry Night might be Liu Yun, but it was only a guess.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>On the rankings, the Guardians that Zhou Wen could already confirm were Jiang Yan’s Fairy Burial and Uesugi Nao’s Great Skyfiend. In addition, Zhou Wen guessed that Ya was Zhong Ziya and Starry Night was Liu Yun. If he thought about it this way, among Wang Mingyuan’s students, only he and Hui Haifeng weren’t on the rankings.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng wanted to do research, so he definitely wouldn’t participate in the battle. Zhou Wen didn’t have a strong desire to participate either.</p>
<p>Previously, he had wanted to participate in the battle because he wanted to go to the dimension to take a look at Wang Mingyuan’s situation. However, now that he knew that Wang Mingyuan was doing pretty well there, Zhou Wen lacked the motivation to participate.</p>
<p>It didn’t seem worth risking his life for a divine fruit. Furthermore, Zhou Wen hadn’t advanced to the Mythical stage, so it was impossible for him to participate in the battle.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was studying the ranking, he saw the cube suddenly light up. It was the countdown on it. There was only a month left.</p>
<p>On the cube’s screen, a shadow appeared. The shadow was distorted and blurry, making it impossible to see what it looked like, but it made one feel that it was a biological creature.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had once entered the dimension and knew that the other party was indeed a biological creature, but because the level of the dimensional world far exceeded Earth’s, the vision of Earth’s creatures couldn’t accurately capture the other party’s physical characteristics. Therefore, it looked like a distorted shadow.</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn’t that the other party was distorted, but that the level of vision of humans on Earth was insufficient.</p>
<p>Soon, the figure emitted a voice. “In 720 hours, the first on the ranking will become the owner of Earth who will control the fate of Earth. Humans with Guardians, show your strength to your heart’s content. The victor is king, and the loser is vilified. This is an eternal truth. I look forward to the birth of the King of Earth.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter992'>Chapter 992: Dimensional Wheel</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Many people disapproved of the shadow’s words. So what if someone became first on the rankings? No matter how strong they were, it was impossible for them to control all of humanity. The various bigwigs wouldn’t admit that such a person had become the lord of Earth.</p>
<p>“You might think that this is ridiculous. Why is the person first on the rankings the lord of Earth? It’s very simple. This is because the first on the rankings will obtain the Dimensional Wheel that represents dimensional power. Whoever controls it will obtain invincible power. The possession of the Dimensional Wheel will last until next year’s ranking battle. Then, the next King of Earth and the owner of the Dimensional Wheel will be decided.” As the figure spoke, a light wheel appeared on the screen. As the light was too intense, it was like a sun. Ordinary people couldn’t see what it was.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a careful look and could only tell that it resembled a sphere. He didn’t know what it was for.</p>
<p>Have the rules been changed? Zhou Wen was puzzled before sending The Thearch a message. “The Thearch, I remember you once said that the various races agreed to hold a Guardian battle once every hundred years to determine the ownership of Earth. Why has it become a year?”</p>
<p>The Thearch quickly replied: “I’m in Chess Mountain. How would I know what happened in the dimension? However, I can guess that it might be related to your teacher, Wang Mingyuan.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen didn’t understand how The Thearch had come to such a conclusion.</p>
<p>“Because the fellows in the dimension also have fear,” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>“Fear? Are you saying that they are afraid of Teacher?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>Although Wang Mingyuan had become the king of the Dragon Gods, according to what Zhou Wen knew, there were eight such monarchs among the Octokind. Furthermore, above the Octokind were terrifying Apocalypse-grade powerhouses. It didn’t seem right to say that they were afraid of Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>“Wang Mingyuan only absorbed and fused with a Guardian. In such a short period of time, he actually broke through to the Calamity grade. Such an evolutionary speed is extremely terrifying in the dimension. You have to understand that the time in the dimension isn’t calculated in the same way as here. Any lifeform’s lifespan far exceeds humans by a hundred or a thousand times, but their evolution speed will also be much slower. Wang Mingyuan’s evolution speed has frightened some dimensional species, so they want to speed up their exploration of Earth,” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>“If they are really that afraid, why don’t they just kill Teacher?” Zhou Wen felt that The Thearch’s analysis wasn’t convincing.</p>
<p>“It’s not like there’s only one race in the dimension. Their relationship is very complicated. Although I haven’t seen him with my own eyes, I can imagine that your teacher is a very intelligent person. He understands the balance of survival in the dimension. Although it might be very dangerous, he hasn’t died yet,” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>“That’s just your guess,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s right or wrong. What’s interesting is that some people have changed the rules, proving their impatience.” The Thearch didn’t argue with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What exactly is that Dimensional Wheel ? Can one really be invincible with it?” Zhou Wen now valued this problem.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I’ve been trapped in Chess Mountain for too long. In our era, there wasn’t such a thing. However, since it’s something that those fellows created, it likely has powerful strength. I don’t know if one will become invincible with it, but the power of that thing is definitely not weaker than the Terror grade,” The Thearch pondered.</p>
<p>All the cubes in the world dimmed. The creature and Dimensional Wheel that had spoken previously vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression was somewhat solemn. The appearance of the Dimensional Wheel had caused the situation on Earth to slide in an unpredictable direction.</p>
<p>If it was really as they said, possessing the Dimensional Wheel meant invincibility, what would happen if the person who obtained the Dimensional Wheel was someone like Jing Daoxian and Night Thearch?</p>
<p>Just imagine what would happen to Earth if an invincible power appeared on Earth and was controlled by a crazy person?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t imagine it, nor did he dare think about it.</p>
<p>At the same time, what made Zhou Wen feel depressed was the lofty attitude of the dimensional creatures. They seemed to treat Earth as a game arena. Whoever won the game would be rewarded by them.</p>
<p>What was the difference between this and dogs in a dog-fighting ring who were rewarded by their owners with dog food?</p>
<p>How can I break the influence of the dimension on humans? Zhou Wen constantly pondered over this question.</p>
<p>Snatching the so-called Dimensional Wheel that could bestow invincible power wasn’t the real solution.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in being the king of the doggy arena. What he wanted was to destroy the supercilious dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>It doesn’t seem possible to defeat them at present. The physiques of humans are too weak. Without the help of Guardians, it’s difficult for us to advance to the Mythical stage. And a Mythical stage is no different from cannon fodder in dimensional zones. Zhou Wen knew very well the difference.</p>
<p>However, no matter how great the difference was, he still wanted to continue because there was no way out unless he wanted to muddle his way through life.</p>
<p>Can I think of a way to sever the connection between the dimension and Earth? This thought surfaced in Zhou Wen’s mind, but he quickly rejected it.</p>
<p>Perhaps there really was such a method that could sever the connection between the two, but after severing it, humanity had no chance of advancing further. They would only be trapped in this world, making no progress.</p>
<p>Once the passageway between the two was opened again, humanity would face an even more difficult situation.</p>
<p>Instead of waiting to be ravaged, he might as well resolve the problem now and make humanity stronger. He wanted humanity to be strong enough to fight dimensional creatures. Only then could they truly escape the fate of being enslaved.</p>
<p>The ice maiden once said that Earth might be the birthplace of the dimension. Many things here can be said to be extremely precious in the dimension. Perhaps this is the true opportunity for humanity, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>“Are you interested in becoming the King of Earth? I can help you contract the strongest Guardian.” The Thearch wanted to tempt Zhou Wen again.</p>
<p>“How powerful is it? Is it at the Terror grade?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Of course.” The Thearch gave an affirmative answer.</p>
<p>“A Guardian that survived from ancient times?” Zhou Wen immediately guessed something. This was because he had never seen a newly born Guardian with the Terror transformation ability.</p>
<p>“Yes, an invincible Guardian of that era.” The Thearch sent a message.</p>
<h3 id='chapter993'>Chapter 993: Frost City</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Which Guardian is it?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“If you are willing, you will naturally know when the time comes,” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>“Forget it. I’m just an ordinary student. I’ll let someone else be the King of Earth.” Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t agree.</p>
<p>Now, he was just short of a Glimmer advancing to a Perfect Body. Perhaps the Mythical stage was already close at hand. How could he contract a Guardian at such a time?</p>
<p>Ignoring becoming the number one person in the world back then, Zhou Wen wouldn’t even consider becoming the number one person in the universe now.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen couldn’t tell how true The Thearch’s words were.</p>
<p>The Thearch’s era’s invincible Guardian shouldn’t be from the Chess Mountain’s faction right? Zhou Wen knew some history.</p>
<p>Chess Mountain likely represented the Shang Dynasty, but the Shang Dynasty was ultimately replaced by Zhou. If that was also a battle between Guardians, the strongest Guardian should be in Zhou.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen felt that The Thearch was probably bragging and trying to trick him.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng’s research finally produced results. After injecting Qin Ling with a new element, the Dracotaur bloodline in Qin Ling’s body became stable.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know how he differentiated stability and instability, but Hui Haifeng told them with certainty that Qin Ling’s Dracotaur bloodline couldn’t be used to mutate other creatures in the future.</p>
<p>In that case, Qin Ling would be useless to Night Thearch. Night Thearch probably wouldn’t find trouble with her again.</p>
<p>However, the dimensional creatures in the Seven Dragons Sea were a huge problem. If humans were injured by them, they would still be infected and mutate.</p>
<p>This was something that couldn’t be resolved. This was because all the creatures in the Seven Dragons Sea had been infected and mutated. There were so many dimensional creatures that they couldn’t kill them all. The numbers were unimaginably huge.</p>
<p>Therefore, they could only hope that humans didn’t court death. As long as they didn’t enter the Seven Dragons Sea, nothing would happen. Without the Seven Seas Dragon King’s command, those dimensional creatures wouldn’t rush out of the Seven Dragons Sea.</p>
<p>Of course, it didn’t eliminate the possibility that someone wanted to take that one-thousandth chance. If the mutation succeeded, they could obtain quite a bit of strength.</p>
<p>As for the Seven Seas Dragon King, Zhou Wen got Primordial Spore to control it and enter the calabash. He made it its residence.</p>
<p>Primordial Spore was still unable to completely occupy its soul. The Seven Seas Dragon King would occasionally resist, but most of the time, it was under Primordial Spore’s control.</p>
<p>Sea Return City’s matters were mostly settled, and Night Thearch didn’t return. Zhou Wen planned on leaving Sea Return City and heading north. After returning to Luoyang, he would head to the North District to take a look.</p>
<p>Firstly, it was because the Ultimate Family Clan in the North District had expressed their goodwill to Zhou Wen. Secondly, Lance had always wanted to invite him over.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Sadie, Gulli, and company were considered members of the Xuanwen Club and had a good relationship with Zhou Wen and company. They also wanted to invite Zhou Wen to be a guest at the Ultimate Family Clan.</p>
<p>Sadie and Gulli had originally come for Zhou Wen. They didn’t plan on really finishing their four years of studies at Sunset College, so it was only a matter of time before they returned. When they heard that Zhou Wen was willing to go to the Ultimate Family Clan, they planned on returning together.</p>
<p>Now, the roads between the districts were getting harder and harder to traverse. They were afraid that it wouldn’t be that easy if they returned any later.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally wanted to go to the North District because he wanted to cultivate the Glimmer Life Soul. He had to go to places he had never been before, or he would have only gamed at home.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng wanted to stay in Sea Return City to do research. Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan joined Zhou Wen’s trip to the North District.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan didn’t stay in Sea Return City to accompany Qin Ling. This left Zhou Wen somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>“Little Yanyan, Beauty Qin is alone in Sea Return City. Aren’t you afraid that she will be snatched away by others?” Li Xuan was more nosy than Zhou Wen and asked directly.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan sighed and said, “Actually, I don’t know what to do.”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you despise her for having a dragon bloodline?” Li Xuan said with widened eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s not what you think. It’s just that I’ve always treated her as my biological sister in the past. I’ve never thought about romance. For the moment, I don’t know what to do,” Feng Qiuyan said in frustration.</p>
<p>“You really are blind to the comforts you are enjoying. If I had such a beautiful fiancée, I would have long given up my virgin boy skill,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Cut it out.” Zhou Wen said to Feng Qiuyan, “Then you have to think carefully. Don’t regret it when the time comes.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“I know. I’ll consider it carefully,” Feng Qiuyan said seriously.</p>
<p>After meeting up with Sadie and Gulli, everyone set off for the North District. There were indeed many changes on the way, but the Ultimate Family Clan had long sent people to pick up Sadie and Gulli. Zhou Wen followed them without any accidents.</p>
<p>The North District was even colder now. There was ice and snow everywhere. The creatures that could survive here had very strong physiques.</p>
<p>Sadie and Gulli described many dimensional zones in the North District to Zhou Wen, making him look forward to them.</p>
<p>The group arrived at Frost City, where the Ultimate Family Clan was located. The city was actually built with ice. It looked like a fairytale world.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that Lance would welcome them, but he didn’t see him. Furthermore, when Zhou Wen asked about Lance, the person who came to welcome them spoke hesitantly as though he was hiding something.</p>
<p>Gulli was a straightforward person. He grabbed the person and asked, “What’s wrong with Lance?”</p>
<p>Helpless, the person could only tell Gulli and company.</p>
<p>Only then did everyone realize that Lance had been injured.</p>
<p>The person who had injured him was a young man from the Ultimate Family Clan, but he could only be considered a collateral relative. Lance had been injured in a fair duel.</p>
<p>“Impossible. How can that fellow, Joseph, be my brother’s match? My brother can give him a four-limb handicap, and Joseph still wouldn’t be his match.” Gulli shouted when he heard the name of the person who injured Lance.</p>
<p>“Gulli, you have been away from Frost City for too long. There are some things you aren’t aware of. Joseph has contracted a Guardian and is extremely powerful now. He challenged Lance and defeated him. Among the younger generation, he’s the strongest.” As the person spoke, he said to Sadie, “Sadie, you have to be careful. He challenged Lance and severely injured him. I’m afraid he will challenge you next.”</p>
<p>“How dare he!” Gulli said angrily.</p>
<p>Sadie gestured for Gulli not to be angry. After some thought, she said, “Joseph is also a member of the Ultimate Family Clan. I don’t think he will go against me. Let’s head back now.”</p>
<p>After the few of them entered the city and Zhou Wen and Li Xuan settled down, they planned on touring Frost City.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company followed the local customs and bought a fur coat and fur hat. Ya’er put on a white fox fur coat and looked charmingly naive.</p>
<p>“There are actually people selling Tyrant Behemoth dolls here?” Li Xuan said in surprise when he saw a large Tyrant Behemoth doll while they were shopping.</p>
<p>“That’s a figurine, not a doll,” a seven-year-old boy corrected him seriously.</p>
<h3 id='chapter994'>Chapter 994: True Tyrant Behemoth</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Isn’t it the same?” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Of course it’s different. Figurines aren’t toys for children, but works of art,” the boy explained seriously.</p>
<p>“I don’t see any difference. It’s just a doll.” Li Xuan looked around and couldn’t tell what was different about this Tyrant Behemoth doll. It just looked more exquisite.</p>
<p>The boy said angrily, “Not at all. If you don’t understand, don’t spout nonsense. This is a great work.”</p>
<p>Li Xuan looked inside the shop and curled his lips. “If it’s really a great work, why isn’t there a single customer in the shop other than you?”</p>
<p>“Let me see… Wow… Such a tiny doll is actually sold for more than a hundred thousand. It’s no wonder no one wants to buy it. After all, a doll is only a doll. It’s so expensive. Which kid would spend so much money to buy a doll? With so much money, it’s enough to buy a very good Legendary Companion Egg.” Li Xuan was bored and wanted to tease the boy.</p>
<p>The boy immediately said, “That’s not the case. Tyrant Behemoth and Tai Sui used to sell very well, but… but…”</p>
<p>“But what?” Li Xuan pressed.</p>
<p>“However, those people are too superficial. They feel that Guardians are stronger than Tyrant Behemoth, so they went to buy Guardian figurines,” the boy said sadly.</p>
<p>“Is this shop yours?” Zhou Wen looked at the Companion Beast models placed in the shop. It sold several Companion Beast models which topped the rankings last time, but most of them were Tyrant Behemoth and Tai Sui.</p>
<p>Other Companion Beast models typically only had two or three types, but there were many different versions of Tyrant Behemoth and Tai Sui. There was a huge difference in sizes and models.</p>
<p>There were replicas, cartoon versions, cute versions, and ferocious versions. There was a huge difference in size. The biggest Tyrant Behemoth was on the shop’s display booth. It was more than four meters tall and looked very similar to Tyrant Behemoth when it wasn’t huge. It was a one-to-one replica.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen really didn’t know that Tyrant Behemoth and Tai Sui were so popular.</p>
<p>“Yes.” The boy nodded.</p>
<p>“Since Guardians are popular, why don’t you sell Guardians? Is there a problem with the supply?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>The boy shook his head and said, “The figurines are made by our own factory. It’s very easy to create a Guardian figurine, but I don’t like it. I don’t want to sell the figurines of those Guardians.”</p>
<p>“Why? Did a Guardian bully you?” Li Xuan asked with interest.</p>
<p>“I sold these Companion Beasts because they are partners who fight for humans, but those Guardians aren’t. I heard from Mommy that those Guardians fight to enslave Earth and us humans. No matter how powerful they are, I won’t sell their figurines, much less make them,” the boy said with a serious expression.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen and Li Xuan heard that, they knew that the boy’s background wasn’t simple. For him to know this information, it meant that his father wasn’t an ordinary person.</p>
<p>“Others are selling them, but if you don’t sell, there won’t be any business. Then, can this shop continue operating?” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Anyway, the shop belongs to my family. At most, it won’t be sold. It’s not a big deal. Besides, I believe that Tyrant Behemoth, Tai Sui, and company will definitely showcase their powerful strength on the rankings. When that happens, those superficial fellows will know that Companion Beasts aren’t inferior to Guardians at all. They can even be stronger,” the boy said.</p>
<p>This time, Li Xuan didn’t strike a blow at him. He knew that the chances of a Companion Beast appearing alone were very low. It could only appear in a Guardian battle coupled with another Guardian.</p>
<p>However, seeing how stubborn and serious the boy was, even Li Xuan couldn’t bear to tell him the truth.</p>
<p>“Little Yi, we should return,” a middle-aged man walked in and said to the boy.</p>
<p>However, when he saw Zhou Wen’s appearance, he said in surprise, “You are Zhou Wen?”</p>
<p>When the boy heard Zhou Wen, he was first taken aback before his eyes widened. He looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement and asked, “Your name is Zhou Wen too?”</p>
<p>“Yes, my name is Zhou Wen.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man said, “What do you mean by Zhou Wen too? He’s Tyrant Behemoth’s owner, Zhou Wen.”</p>
<p>After the boy heard that, he asked in disbelief, “You… Are you really Tyrant Behemoth’s master?”</p>
<p>“If there’s no second Tyrant Behemoth, I think I should be the one you are referring to,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You… You… Are you really… Is Tyrant Behemoth alright? No, that’s not what I meant. It’s great to be able to see you… My name is Li Benyi. I really like you and your Tyrant Behemoth…” The boy immediately became nervous as he spoke incoherently.</p>
<p>“Do you want to see the real Tyrant Behemoth?” Zhou Wen asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“Can… I?” Li Benyi’s voice trembled with excitement.</p>
<p>“Of course.” Zhou Wen looked at the space here. The exhibition hall was very high and was more than enough to accommodate Tyrant Behemoth. He summoned Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>“Wow… It’s really Tyrant Behemoth. It’s so cool. It’s even cooler than what I saw in the video. Our figurines aren’t good enough…” Li Benyi looked at Zhou Wen with a look of longing.” Can I touch it? ”</p>
<p>“Of course. If you are willing, I can let it take you around,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Yes… Yes… Of course I’m willing… Thank you so much.” Li Benyi immediately jumped up excitedly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen got Tyrant Behemoth to extend its hand and lift Li Benyi up. It placed him on its shoulder and carried him around the shop.</p>
<p>“How cool. When I grow up, I’ll also want to have such a Companion Beast.” Li Benyi stroked Tyrant Behemoth’s hair and wore a blissful expression.</p>
<p>“Sorry to trouble you,” the middle-aged man said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. It’s rare for someone to like my Companion Beast so much.” Zhou Wen looked at the symbol on the middle-aged man’s clothes and asked, “Are you from the Ultimate Family Clan?”</p>
<p>The middle-aged man nodded. “Yes. I was in charge of picking you up, but something happened on my end and someone else took my place. I didn’t expect us to be so fated to meet here. My name is Li Benyu.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen chatted with Li Benyu for a while before realizing that he was considered a collateral relative of the Ultimate Family Clan. He didn’t have the bloodline of the Ultimate Family Clan, but he was invited to join because he was valued by the Ultimate Family Clan in certain aspects.</p>
<p>Li Benyu was from the East District, but his wife had the pure bloodline of the Ultimate Family Clan. Li Benyi was a mixed-blood.</p>
<p>“Thank you. I’ve completed one of my two dreams. Now, I’m only left with seeing Tai Sui with my own eyes.” When Tyrant Behemoth brought Li Benyi back, he still looked unsatisfied. He didn’t want to let go of Tyrant Behemoth’s fingers as he thanked Zhou Wen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter995'>Chapter 995: Joseph</h3>
<p>1</p>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Li Xuan couldn’t help but be amused when he heard that. He glanced at Zhou Wen and said, “Benyi, your other dream is to meet Tai Sui?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Tyrant Behemoth is our Federation’s hero, and so is Tai Sui. Furthermore, it’s the previous generation’s No. 1. I also want to see it with my own eyes, but I don’t know who its owner is. I got Dad to help me investigate for a long time, but I couldn’t find out who Tai Sui’s owner is,” Li Benyi said helplessly. “Indeed. A mysterious Companion Beast like Tai Sui must have a very powerful human master, an existence akin to the six heroes. It would be difficult to meet the owner even if I knew who he is, right?”</p>
<p>“It’s not difficult for you to meet Tai Sui. Just beg him,” Li Xuan said as he pointed at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Why?” Li Benyi still didn’t understand.</p>
<p>“Because Tai Sui is also his Companion Beast. If he’s happy, you can even hug Tai Sui to sleep, much less look at it,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Li Benyi gaped in disbelief as he looked at Zhou Wen, speechless. It was as though happiness had come too suddenly.</p>
<p>Tai Sui being his Companion Beast was no longer a secret. Many people around him knew about it, so there was no need for him to hide it. Zhou Wen decided to summon Tai Sui.</p>
<p>“It’s really Tai Sui… You actually have Tyrant Behemoth and Tai Sui at the same time… You’re really lucky…” Li Benyi’s eyes turned red from excitement.</p>
<p>“It’s alright. They aren’t easy to raise,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Can I hug it?” Li Benyi automatically ignored Zhou Wen’s words as he looked at Tai Sui—which resembled a white, bouncing ball—with glowing eyes.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>Li Benyi picked up Tai Sui with trembling hands. He felt like he was the happiest person in the world. In just one day, all his dreams were fulfilled.</p>
<p>Li Benyi suddenly thought of something and asked Zhou Wen excitedly, “Zhou Wen… No, no, no… Idol… You will get Tyrant Behemoth and Tai Sui to participate in the battle, right? You will defeat those Guardians, right?”</p>
<p>“I have things to do at the moment. I’m not sure if I can finish them in time. If I finish it before the one-month countdown, I might participate in the battle,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I see. I hope you can quickly finish your matters. I really want to see Tyrant Behemoth and Tai Sui defeat those Guardians.” Although Li Benyi was somewhat disappointed, he still supported Zhou Wen. He only hoped that Zhou Wen could settle his matters before the ranking battle ended.</p>
<p>If an adult heard Zhou Wen’s explanation, they would think that it was just an excuse, but Li Benyi believed it.</p>
<p>“Alright,” Zhou Wen answered with a slight nod.</p>
<p>If he could advance to the Mythical stage before the Battle of Guardians ended, he indeed had plans to participate in the battle. Even if he couldn’t obtain first place, he could eliminate some Guardians.</p>
<p>Guardians would only become stronger. Just like Night Thearch’s Guardian, it was already at the Terror grade. Most of the newly contracted Guardians probably hadn’t reached the Terror grade. It was relatively easy to eliminate them now. In the future, the situation would only become more complicated.</p>
<p>However, it would probably be difficult to kill a Guardian like Night Thearch. Although Zhou Wen had the Ice Dragon King’s Terror item, it wasn’t easy to injure Night Thearch when he was on guard.</p>
<p>“Little Yi, you actually believe such a lame excuse? How naive.” A voice sounded from the door. Everyone turned their heads and saw a young man who was about the same age as Zhou Wen and company—or just slightly older—walk into the shop.</p>
<p>“Joseph, what are you doing here?” Li Benyi said unhappily when he saw the young man.</p>
<p>“To visit my brother and uncle, of course,” said Joseph indifferently.</p>
<p>“Who’s your brother? We don’t have that kind of relationship,” Li Benyi said.</p>
<p>“You’re still young and naive. I don’t blame you.” Joseph frowned slightly before turning to Li Benyu. “Uncle, have you considered the matter we discussed previously?”</p>
<p>Li Benyu pondered and said, “Joseph, you should know that the Companion Beast was specially prepared for Little Yi by the family head…”</p>
<p>“Uncle, Little Yi is still young. If he wants to contract a Mythical Companion Egg, he will have to wait at least a decade. You also know how fast the world changes. After more than a decade, Mythical Companion Eggs will no longer be worth anything. Lend me the Companion Egg now. You also know that I’ve already contracted a Guardian. With the help of a Mythical Companion Beast, it will be like adding wings to a tiger. Killing Mythical creatures will be as easy as flipping a hand. How many Mythical Companion Eggs do you want in the future? When Little Yi grows up, I’ll give him ten Mythical Companion Eggs…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan listened for a while and roughly understood what was going on. However, these family matters after all. The two of them didn’t know the details, so they didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>“Joseph, I’m really sorry. This Companion Egg is said to be for Joseph, but it’s actually the dowry that the family head gave to your aunt. The meaning is different. I can’t lend it to you,” Li Benyu said.</p>
<p>“Uncle, why haven’t you gotten your head out of the mud? You and Aunt have raised me since I was young, just like my biological parents. Now that I’ve contracted a Guardian, I have authority in the family. In the future, my authority will only grow. My parents are long dead, and you are my only family. In the future, not only will I take care of you and Aunt, but Little Yi will also have me to take care of in the future. Won’t he have all the best resources when that happens? Now that I have the ability, I’ll repay you in the future. You also know that I’ve just contracted a Guardian and haven’t had the time to obtain a Mythical Companion Beast. If you help me now, it will be helping your own family…” Joseph continued persuading.</p>
<p>“I really can’t help you with this matter. Furthermore, we adopted you back then only because your mother is my wife’s sister. We didn’t expect you to repay us. We just want you to live well,” Li Benyu said.</p>
<p>Joseph’s expression became a little nasty. “Uncle, let’s talk about this later. You have to discuss it with my aunt after all. She should understand that this is a good thing for our family.”</p>
<p>“Then wait for her to come back. I still have guests to entertain, so I won’t keep you,” Li Benyu said.</p>
<p>Joseph glanced at Zhou Wen and curled his lips in disdain. “Zhou Wen, right? I heard that your Companion Beasts are very strong? Unfortunately, the era of Companion Beasts is over. In the future, it will be the Guardian’s world. It’s useless having so many Companion Beasts.”</p>
<p>Li Xuan couldn’t stand it any longer as he quipped, “It may be useless, but it isn’t stopping you from shamelessly requesting one.”</p>
<p>Joseph’s expression turned ugly. Before he could flare up, Li Benyu said, “Gentlemen, the family head is still waiting to meet you. I’ll take you there.”</p>
<p>With that said, Li Benyu pulled Li Benyi along with him and left the shop with Zhou Wen and Li Xuan.</p>
<h3 id='chapter996'>Chapter 996: Choices ABC</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>After leaving the shop, Li Xuan asked Li Benyu, “Brother Li, if it’s convenient, can you tell me what’s going on with this Joseph?”</p>
<p>“This…” Li Benyu was a little hesitant.</p>
<p>Li Benyi said angrily, “What’s there not to say? That Joseph is an ingrate.”</p>
<p>After Li Benyi’s explanation, Zhou Wen and company finally learned the details.</p>
<p>Just as they had guessed, Joseph’s mother and Li Benyu’s wife were biological sisters. When Joseph was around twelve, his parents entered a dimensional zone and never returned—Joseph became an orphan.</p>
<p>Therefore, Li Benyu and his wife adopted Joseph. Although they couldn’t say that they treated him the same as Li Benyi, they tried their best to take care of him, allowing him to live a carefree life. They even gave him various resources and opportunities.</p>
<p>On the surface, Joseph was respectful and kind to them. When he grew up, he even helped run the factory. Who knew that he would secretly siphon off funds in the factory and nearly caused the factory to close down?</p>
<p>Only then did Li Benyu suspect that there was something wrong with Joseph. If not for his deceased mother, it would have been enough to send him to jail.</p>
<p>As for the details, Li Benyi didn’t say much. However, one could tell that it wasn’t Joseph’s sole instance. Now, he was even thinking of targeting their Mythical Companion Egg. He was extremely shameless.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and Zhou Wen were taken aback when they heard that. They never expected such a person to exist in the world.</p>
<p>This wasn’t hearsay. They had seen Joseph’s face with their own eyes today. It was no wonder Li Benyi hated him so much.</p>
<p>“To think that such a person would be fancied by a Guardian. From the looks of it, the Guardian’s standards aren’t that great,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Li Benyi pursed his lips and said, “Do you know what Joseph’s Guardian’s name is? His name is Lie.”</p>
<p>“The Guardian ranked 14th?” Li Xuan and Zhou Wen immediately thought of the Guardian on the rankings.</p>
<p>“Yes. Although Joseph has never said what his Guardian’s name is, it can’t be hidden once he’s on the rankings. I’m guessing that he must have obtained this Guardian in the Maze of Lies. It’s obvious that Joseph and his Guardian aren’t good people,” Li Benyi said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously heard from Sadie and company that the Maze of Lies was a famous dimensional zone near Frost City.</p>
<p>In the Maze of Lies, one absolutely couldn’t speak the truth. Once one spoke the truth, they would be killed by the taboo power inside. Therefore, humans who entered the maze typically sealed their mouths to prevent themselves from speaking, lest they trigger the taboo power.</p>
<p>After all, it was impossible for an ordinary human to not tell a single truth.</p>
<p>“Dad, why did you stop Zhou Wen just now? Let Zhou Wen use Tyrant Behemoth and Tai Sui to defeat him. Let’s see how arrogant he can be,” Li Benyi said.</p>
<p>“He has a Guardian. Don’t take it to heart.” Li Benyu was actually afraid that Zhou Wen would be injured.</p>
<p>Although Tyrant Behemoth and Tai Sui might be very strong, just as Joseph had said, people now felt that Guardians were invincible. Companion Beasts were no match for them. Otherwise, how could Guardians be ranked at the top of the rankings? No Companion Beast’s ranking could surpass those Guardians.</p>
<p>Therefore, Li Benyu stopped them in time to prevent Zhou Wen and company from being injured by the Guardian.</p>
<p>“So what if he has a Guardian? One Tyrant Behemoth can defeat him, much less Tai Sui,” Li Benyi said.</p>
<p>“So in your hearts, my Guardian is so weak. It’s no wonder Uncle refuses to lend me the Companion Egg. It’s because you look down on my Guardian.” At some point in time, Joseph had followed them and heard Li Benyi’s words.</p>
<p>“Little Yi was just joking. Don’t take the child’s words seriously,” Li Benyu had no choice but to say.</p>
<p>“No, Little Yi has a huge misunderstanding about me and my Guardian. From the looks of it, I have to resolve this misunderstanding.” Joseph looked at Li Benyi and said, “Little Yi, since you think his Companion Beast is stronger than my Guardian, why don’t we make a bet? Let him fight me. If he wins, it will prove that your words are correct. I won’t mention borrowing Companion Eggs again in the future. If he loses, why don’t you lend me your Companion Egg?”</p>
<p>With that said, Joseph added with a smile, “Since you are so confident in his Companion Beast, you wouldn’t be afraid to accept my challenge, right?”</p>
<p>Before Li Benyu could say a word, Li Benyi said, “Of course I dare. However, Zhou Wen and company are guests. I can’t trouble them.”</p>
<p>Joseph looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Little Yi is so confident in you. Don’t you want to help him?”</p>
<p>Li Benyu hurriedly interjected, “Joseph, they are the family head’s guests. Don’t mess around.”</p>
<p>However, Joseph curled his lips and said, “What guest of the family head? Aren’t they just Lance and Sadie’s friends? Lance has already been defeated by me. When I’m free in the future, I’ll defeat Sadie and let the family know who the real genius is.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure you want to challenge me?” Zhou Wen suddenly asked.</p>
<p>“Of course, if Little Yi is willing to let you represent him, I don’t mind letting him know that in this world, only the Guardians are truly powerful existences,” said Joseph.</p>
<p>“Alright, wait a moment.” Zhou Wen took out his phone and sent a message to Lance and Sadie.</p>
<p>After all, he was a guest invited by Lance and Sadie. It didn’t seem too good to kill the Guardian of the Ultimate Family Clan here, so he informed the two of them first.</p>
<p>Joseph was quite a distance away from Zhou Wen, but his eyes were good. He realized that the friend icon he was talking to belonged to Lance.</p>
<p>“You only want to investigate me now? Isn’t it too late?” Joseph said contemptuously.</p>
<p>He didn’t spend much effort defeating Lance because the latter was only at the Epic stage. He didn’t even have a Mythical Companion Beast, so he easily won with a Guardian.</p>
<p>Therefore, he was very certain that Lance didn’t have any information to divulge to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, when Joseph saw Zhou Wen’s message, he nearly blew his top.</p>
<p>“There’s a person in your family named Joseph who wants to challenge me. As he’s from your family, I want to ask for your opinion. As for the three options below regarding the Guardian, which one is more suitable? Please reply with the letter as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>A: Beat him to death.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>B: Cripple him.</p>
<p>C: Knock him out.</p>
<p>Then, Joseph realized that Zhou Wen had copied the message and sent it to Sadie as well.</p>
<p>Beep! Beep!</p>
<p>Soon, Lance and Sadie replied. Their answers were unanimous: “A.”</p>
<p>2</p>
<h3 id='chapter997'>Chapter 997: The Maze of Lies</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Lance and Sadie gave the answer A, clearly telling Zhou Wen that there was no need to have any qualms.</p>
<p>Since they didn’t mind, Zhou Wen didn’t need to have any qualms. This Joseph was irritating. Furthermore, he could also eliminate a Guardian in passing. There was no reason for him to let him off.</p>
<p>After receiving the answer, Zhou Wen looked at Li Benyi and asked, “Are you willing to let me fight him on your behalf?”</p>
<p>“Of course I’m willing. Please let him know that a Guardian is nothing impressive,” Li Benyi said excitedly.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you want to challenge me? You can do it now,” Zhou Wen said to Joseph.</p>
<p>“You sure are confident to think nothing of Guardians.” Joseph curled his lips in disdain before asking Li Benyu, “Uncle, can he represent you? If he loses, will you really lend me the Mythical Companion Egg?”</p>
<p>Li Benyu was somewhat hesitant, but Li Benyi said to him, “Dad, please agree. Zhou Wen has the strongest Tai Sui and Tyrant Behemoth. He won’t lose. Please, Dad.”</p>
<p>Li Benyu patted Li Benyi’s head. “Alright, I agree.”</p>
<p>Li Benyu didn’t have as much confidence in Zhou Wen as Li Benyi did. However, no matter how precious a Mythical Companion Egg was, it ultimately belonged to Li Benyi in the future. There were some things that he should experience.</p>
<p>It was naturally best if Zhou Wen could win, but even if he lost, he could teach Li Benyi a deep lesson that he would never forget.</p>
<p>Although he might lose a Mythical Companion Egg, Li Benyu believed that it wasn’t an unacceptable price.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen knew that Li Benyu was thinking this way, he would probably sigh. The son of a rich family was really blessed.</p>
<p>“Uncle, it’s not that I don’t believe you, but there are some things that need to be made black and white or it might hurt our family’s feelings when the time comes,” said Joseph.</p>
<p>Li Benyu frowned, but before he could say anything, Zhou Wen continued, “Yes, we should make a contract. Both parties are responsible for any losses incurred during the duel. It will save us trouble.”</p>
<p>“Yes, in case Joseph cries from the beating and goes to the family head to complain again,” Li Benyi said.</p>
<p>“Also, if I lose, you can take the Companion Egg. What if you lose?” Zhou Wen asked Li Benyi.</p>
<p>“I won’t mention borrowing the Companion Egg again in the future,” said Joseph without blushing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was about to say something when Li Benyu shook his head and said, “Forget it. It’s fine as long as there’s no trouble in the future.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that Li Benyu had his own considerations. If he were to take something from Joseph now, it would only spell trouble if he continued to pester them in the future.</p>
<p>Since Li Benyu had already said so, Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else. Joseph quickly came up with two contracts. After Zhou Wen and company saw that there was no problem, they signed and thumb-printed the contract.</p>
<p>“Since it’s a fair duel, let’s fight in the family’s arena tomorrow. It will also let everyone know that the era of Guardians has arrived,” Joseph said arrogantly after putting away the contract.</p>
<p>Before the Guardians appeared, Zhou Wen could be said to be the top representative of the younger generation. He had powerful Companion Beasts and excellent talent.</p>
<p>Everyone in the Federation’s six families knew Zhou Wen’s name. Even the older generation feared him.</p>
<p>He wanted to fight Zhou Wen not only because of the Mythical Companion Egg, but also because he wanted to tell everyone that he, Joseph, was a true genius, a person recognized by God. The so-called geniuses in the past were just humans blowing their own trumpets. They had never obtained the recognition of God.</p>
<p>Therefore, he chose to fight in the family’s arena. Furthermore, he wanted to wait until tomorrow to let everyone in the Ultimate Family Clan know of this matter. At the same time, he could personally defeat Zhou Wen in front of his family’s elders and peers.</p>
<p>He had absolute confidence in Guardians, believing that only a Guardian could defeat another Guardian.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that it didn’t matter and agreed. Joseph then left in excitement. It was easy to imagine that he would quickly inform everyone he knew to watch the battle tomorrow.</p>
<p>In fact, even if Joseph didn’t publicize it, Frost City was only small. There were no secrets that could be hidden. Soon, everyone would know.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, do you need our help to prepare anything?” Li Benyi felt that Zhou Wen was helping him in battle and that he should do something.</p>
<p>“If possible, take us to the nearby dimensional zones to take a look. We just came to Frost City and are very interested in the dimensional zones here,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Don’t you need to prepare for tomorrow’s battle?” Li Benyi asked.</p>
<p>“I’m already prepared. There’s no need to make any last-minute preparations,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That’s right. With Tai Sui and Tyrant Behemoth around, you can definitely defeat Joseph’s Guardian. I’m really looking forward to tomorrow’s battle.” Li Benyi wore a look of anticipation.</p>
<p>Under the lead of the Li father-and-son duo, Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, Feng Qiuyan, and Ya’er went to a few more famous dimensional zones.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen didn’t discover the tiny palm symbol in the first few dimensional zones. When he arrived at the Maze of Lies, he chanced upon a tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>“Is this the dimensional zone where Joseph obtained the Guardian?” Li Xuan asked curiously.</p>
<p>“That’s right. The Maze of Lies is very special. You mustn’t tell the truth after entering. For example, if you say your name, it will be the truth. You will be killed by the taboo inside…” Li Benyi explained the situation inside the Maze of Lies.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took out his phone and casually took a picture of the tiny palm symbol. Soon, the Maze of Lies dungeon was downloaded.</p>
<p>According to the Li father-and-son duo, the Maze of Lies was rather dangerous. Apart from the taboo of not being able to speak the truth, the dimensional creatures inside had very strange powers.</p>
<p>For example, there was a Mischief Clown that would hide in the maze and call your name out of the blue. If you answered, it was equivalent to telling the truth. You would be killed by the taboo in the Maze of Lies.</p>
<p>Apart from using the taboo power, the Mischief Clown also had some strange skills. For example, he had an elastic ball that would cause the body to bounce uncontrollably if it was hit by it, making it difficult to dodge its attack.</p>
<p>There were many strange dimensional creatures inside. According to the legends here, the dimensional zone, Maze of Lies, was likely owned by a very famous deity. It was the legendary God of Mischief and Lies, Loki.</p>
<p>Legend has it that in the deepest part of the Maze of Lies, there was a magical mask of mischief. One would gain Loki’s divine powers from wearing the mask.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Of course, that was only a legend. No one had really seen the mask.</p>

<p>After circling Frost City, Zhou Wen felt that his Glimmer Life Soul was already showing signs of a breakthrough, just falling short of it. For some reason, he couldn’t really break through to the Perfect Body.</p>
<p>Could it be that I can’t advance the Glimmer Life Soul by just going to new places? Zhou Wen thought of all sorts of possibilities, but he couldn’t figure out the problem.</p>
<p>In Frost City, he had only downloaded a copy of Maze of Lies. There were many famous dimensional zones in the North District, but it required them to leave Frost City. Zhou Wen and company didn’t plan on going for the time being.</p>
<p>After returning to his residence, Zhou Wen realized that Lance, Sadie, and Gulli were waiting for them.</p>
<p>Lance didn’t look injured, but he was in a wheelchair. His leg must have been injured badly. A beautiful girl was standing behind the wheelchair. It looked like she had pushed Lance over.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“I’ve been waiting for you. Unfortunately, I’m temporarily unable to fight you,” Lance said helplessly.</p>
<p>“Is your leg alright? Do you need help?” Zhou Wen’s Primordial Human Sovereign was very effective in treating external injuries.</p>
<p>Lance shook his head and said, “I’ll be fine after a few days of rest. There’s no problem. As for you, you have to be careful when fighting Joseph. His abilities… No… I should say that his Guardian abilities are somewhat strange…”</p>
<p>“Strange in what way?” Zhou Wen wasn’t a fanatic who pursued combat excitement, so every bit he learned about Joseph’s Guardian was for the better.</p>
<p>“I attacked his body with all my might, but in the end, all his injuries were transferred to me.” Lance explained the situation.</p>
<p>“Damage reflection?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“No, if it was damage reflection, I would have known back then. His ability made the injuries on him appear on me after I was done with the assault. It was as though those injuries were alive and could run on their own,” said Lance.</p>
<p>“That’s quite a special ability.” Zhou Wen pondered as he thought about how to deal with such an ability.</p>
<p>“But if it’s you, it shouldn’t be a problem. I’m looking forward to your performance tomorrow.” Lance smiled.</p>
<p>“If I destroy his Guardian, will your family really be fine?” Zhou Wen found it odd and couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>“No problem,” Lance answered with certainty.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, Joseph is really hated by everyone. At the very least, he has a Guardian. How can the family not value him?” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“The family also wants to value him, but unfortunately, he doesn’t share the same views as the family. He has secretly done many things that have harmed the family’s interests. He believes he did them flawlessly, but in fact, the elders in the family are already well aware of them. They are just discussing how to deal with him,” Sadie said.</p>
<p>“I see.” Only then did Zhou Wen understand why Sadie and Lance had answered so readily.</p>
<p>It turned out that their family had originally planned on dealing with Joseph, but they were somewhat afraid of his Guardian. Furthermore, Joseph was ultimately a member of the Ultimate Family Clan, so it wasn’t appropriate for them to make things too nasty, making the other families in the North District laugh at them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly wanted to fight Joseph. If he could really kill Joseph’s Guardian, it would help the Ultimate Family Clan resolve a problem. They were naturally more than happy to see it happen.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, one doesn’t necessarily enjoy special treatment just because they have powerful strength. It’s no wonder Joseph didn’t plan on letting Li Benyi’s Mythical Companion Egg off,” Zhou Wen said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“Uncle Li and Aunt raised Joseph for nearly ten years and treated him like their own son. They invested all sorts of resources into him, but what he did bitterly disappointed us, let alone Uncle Li and Aunt,” Sadie said.</p>
<p>Everyone chatted for a while before Lance and company returned. They agreed to celebrate after Zhou Wen’s victory tomorrow.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen lay in bed and took out his phone to open the Maze of Lies dungeon he had downloaded today.</p>
<p>After entering the game, the blood-colored avatar appeared in front of an ancient castle. The castle looked very strange, like an ancient amusement park. The various buildings were very strange.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the castle door looked like a clown’s face. The door was the clown’s laughing mouth. Entering the castle was like being devoured by a clown.</p>
<p>“Are you a man or a woman?” A line of words suddenly appeared on the door. A pop-up appeared in-game. There were two options—male and female.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally chose male, but following that, the blood-colored avatar exploded on the spot as the screen went black.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, so this is also the taboo power of the Maze of Lies? Zhou Wen immediately understood that he couldn’t make such choices in the Maze of Lies.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to know the various strange things in the maze, so he didn’t use the Heaven-Opening Scripture. He dripped his blood and revived before arriving at the door of the Maze of Lies.</p>
<p>“Are you a good person or a bad person?” However, this time, the question on the door changed. It was different from what he had seen previously.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately felt stumped. He felt that he wasn’t considered a good person, but he didn’t seem to have done anything too bad. He probably wasn’t considered a bad person.</p>
<p>However, there were only two options on the phone—good and bad. Zhou Wen had to choose one of them.</p>
<p>I should be barely considered a good guy, right? Then, according to the Maze of Lies, I should choose ‘bad person,’ right? Zhou Wen chose ‘bad person’ as his answer.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar exploded on the spot again. The armor and Essence Energy on his body were useless.</p>
<p>How is that possible? Am I a bad person? Zhou Wen found it unbelievable that the taboo power of the Maze of Lies had determined that he was a bad person.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen dripped his blood gloomily to revive again, allowing the blood-colored avatar to come to the entrance of the Maze of Lies.</p>
<p>What was even more depressing was that the question on the Maze of Lies’s door changed again.</p>
<p>“Is your girlfriend your left hand or right hand?”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>F*ck you. I’m not playing anymore. Zhou Wen activated the Heaven-Opening Scripture and pushed open the door to enter the Maze of Lies.</p>
<p>With the protection of the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, the taboo power didn’t work on the blood-colored avatar as it successfully entered the maze.</p>
<p>The first thing he saw when he entered the castle-like maze was a huge merry-go-round.</p>
<p>The diameter of the merry-go-round was at least 30 meters. At this moment, the carousel was spinning, and the horses were moving up and down.</p>
<p>On one of the wooden horses, Zhou Wen saw a puppet clown in a clown costume. He was sitting on the wooden horse with three different-colored balls in his hand. He tossed them around as though he was performing on stage.</p>
<p>Is this the Mischief Clown? Zhou Wen had already heard from Li Benyi that Mischief Clown was an Epic dimensional creature with very unique abilities.</p>
<p>It wasn’t difficult for Zhou Wen to kill Mischief Clown, but he wanted to see what kind of abilities the Mischief Clown had. If the skill was really good, he could consider using it for fusion in the future.</p>
<p>When the clown who was tossing the ball saw the blood-colored avatar, he threw the red, yellow, and blue balls at it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter999'>Chapter 999: Arena</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull and got it to block in front of him.</p>
<p>With a boom, the red ball immediately turned into a ball of flames after hitting the Great Might Vajra Bull, enveloping its entire body.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Great Might Vajra Bull’s body was sufficiently powerful. The Epic flames had no effect on it.</p>
<p>Seeing that the red ball was useless, the clown threw the blue ball out. After the blue ball exploded from the collision, it formed a huge ice fog that could freeze people into ice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was only at the Epic stage. The Great Might Vajra Bull trembled and the frost on its body immediately fell to the ground. It couldn’t be injured at all.</p>
<p>Finally, the clown threw out the yellow ball. This time, after the yellow ball shattered, there was no fire or ice. There was only a plume of smoke, and then there was nothing.</p>
<p>This yellow ball should be the so-called elastic ball, right? From the looks of it, it’s useless. It has no effect on Mythical creatures. Just as Zhou Wen was thinking about it, Great Might Vajra took a step forward.</p>
<p>With this step, the Great Might Vajra Bull’s body seemed to have a spring installed in it. Its body leaped up high. When it landed, it landed heavily on the ground before being bounced even higher.</p>
<p>The Great Might Vajra Bull waved its hooves in the air, but it couldn’t control its body. Its body seemed to have turned into a bouncing ball as it bounced around the ancient castle.</p>
<p>Although the puppet clown’s strength couldn’t injure the Great Might Vajra Bull, it left it in a sorry state.</p>
<p>This skill is interesting! Zhou Wen suddenly realized that this skill was quite good. It could actually affect Mythical creatures.</p>
<p>However, this skill was clearly useless against the Mischief Clown. The Great Might Vajra Bull quickly adapted to the elasticity before transforming into its thousand-handed, bull-headed form. With a golden beam in its hand, it blasted the clown apart.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen circled the maze and encountered quite a number of Mischief Clowns. Therefore, he killed every one of them, hoping to obtain a few Mischief Clown Companion Eggs to use for synthesis in the future.</p>
<p>This skill was useless for the Mischief Clown, but it might be useful when paired with powerful pets.</p>
<p>As he farmed the clowns, he searched the maze. However, in the maze that resembled an amusement park, there were Mischief Clowns everywhere, but he didn’t see any other dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Strange, Li Benyi clearly said that there were many strange dimensional creatures here. Why do I only see clowns? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled, but he couldn’t find any other dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was grinding dungeons, the news of his battle with Joseph had already spread throughout Frost City. It wasn’t just the members of the Ultimate Family Clan. Even the other families and ordinary people in Frost City learned of this news.</p>
<p>Ordinary people weren’t too familiar with the name Zhou Wen, but some of the more powerful families knew what the name represented.</p>
<p>Before the Guardians appeared, Zhou Wen was synonymous with invincibility among the younger generation. However, with the Guardians around, no one could guarantee that Zhou Wen would be as invincible as before.</p>
<p>The top fourteen on the rankings were all Guardians. Such a battle result was too dazzling, making it impossible for people not to treat the strength of Guardians seriously.</p>
<p>Although Joseph’s Lie Guardian was only ranked 14th, it still suppressed all Companion Beasts that fought alone. Furthermore, the Lie had never fought other Guardians. Perhaps its combat strength was higher than its actual ranking.</p>
<p>Therefore, early at dawn the next day, many people from Frost City went to the arena. However, most of them were here to see the Guardian. Only a small number of people had expectations for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen arrived at the arena, he saw that it was already packed with people. Even the top of the walls had people standing on them, and the entrance was packed to the brim.</p>
<p>“Brother, can you make way and let us pass?” Li Xuan led the way, but after squeezing for a long time, he failed to squeeze in. There were too many people inside.</p>
<p>“Let you pass? As if I don’t wish to enter? Do you think it will work? If it works, I’ll be watching the duel inside. If you want to watch the duel, slowly squeeze in. Don’t keep thinking about stupid tricks,” the man in front said.</p>
<p>Li Xuan thought to himself, If Zhou Wen doesn’t enter, what match is there to watch?</p>
<p>He naturally couldn’t say that, so he could only continue squeezing in.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Li Xuan had a solution. He released some Stinky Gu and immediately, the people nearby couldn’t help but squeeze to the side. Finally, they had more space to move around.</p>
<p>However, this move hurt indiscriminately. It wasn’t easy for them either.</p>
<p>After squeezing in with great difficulty, there was still a sea of people inside. It was unknown why the people of Frost City were so free to come here early in the morning to watch their duel.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, that punk, Joseph, has spent quite a bit of effort. He got so many people here just to finish you in front of everyone.” Li Xuan saw through Joseph’s thoughts.</p>
<p>“Actually, I don’t like so many spectators,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>The few of them continued to squeeze in. Thankfully, Gulli discovered them through the surveillance cameras and sent someone to pick them up.</p>
<p>“Why did you enter through the main entrance? Why didn’t you use the special underground passageway!?” Gulli asked Zhou Wen and company in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“There’s a special passageway?” The three of them were taken aback.</p>
<p>“You said there was no need to pick you up, so I thought you knew. Let’s not talk about this. Let’s head to the lounge to prepare. That punk, Joseph, is dying of eagerness,” Gulli said.</p>
<p>Joseph was indeed impatient. The two of them should have gone on stage at the same time, but Joseph had already long appeared in the arena. Furthermore, this fellow was delivering a speech.</p>
<p>“Although I grew up in Frost City, I believe there are many people who don’t know my name. My name is Joseph, and I’m a member of the Ultimate Family Clan. As a person chosen by God, I’ve signed a contract with a Guardian, I will represent the deities to protect Frost City of Frost. No matter what difficulties I encounter, even if I have to sacrifice my life, I will fight foreign enemies to the death…”</p>
<p>“It’s a pity this fellow isn’t a politician…” Li Xuan said with a twitch of his lips when he heard Joseph’s speech.</p>
<p>However, the ordinary citizens who didn’t know Joseph well cheered after hearing his words. Some even shouted his name. It looked like he had successfully fooled many people.</p>
<p>“What a worrisome fellow,” Gulli said gloomily. Zhou Wen saw Sadie, Lance, and company when he arrived in the lounge.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you definitely can defeat him and let those people know how powerful Tyrant Behemoth and Tai Sui are, right?” Li Benyi asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Of course. I still have some experience in killing Guardians. Don’t worry.” Zhou Wen ruffled Li Benyi’s hair before walking towards the entrance.</p>
<p>The moment Zhou Wen walked out of the tunnel, he immediately heard a tsunami-like booing.</p>
<p>Regardless of who was in the right or wrong, from the perspective of the people in Frost City, Zhou Wen was an outsider. They were naturally more willing to support the local Joseph and had treated Zhou Wen as an enemy.</p>
