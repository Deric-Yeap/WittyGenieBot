<p>Seeing Zhou Wen enter the arena, Joseph’s eyes narrowed slightly as he waved his hand and said, “Isn’t your Tyrant Behemoth very strong? Then I’ll wait for you to summon it. If I were to attack first, you wouldn’t even have the chance to summon a Companion Beast.”</p>
<p>As soon as these words were spoken, the spectator stands were filled with cheers. Regardless of whether Joseph had the ability or not, such a domineering declaration made the locals who supported him feel their blood boil. Furthermore, the people here were valiant. It was a place that held martial arts in high esteem.</p>
<p>“This person… really doesn’t know the meaning of death…” Li Xuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan pondered for a moment before saying, “With Joseph’s personality, he should have some ulterior motives for doing so. Previously, Lance said that Joseph has the ability to harm others by transferring injuries. I think he plans on using that move.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I said that he hasn’t died before. He actually dares to use a technique that he has already used before in front of Zhou Wen. I’m afraid he doesn’t even know how he died,” Li Xuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>“That’s true. Since Coach already knows that he has such an ability, it would be too naive for him to use this move against Coach,” Feng Qiuyan said with a nod.</p>
<p>Seeing Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan looking as though Zhou Wen was bound to win, Li Benyu couldn’t help but frown and say, “A Guardian’s strength is the strongest at present. Furthermore, Zhou Wen hasn’t seen Lance and Joseph’s battle with his own eyes. It’s best to be careful. It’s best to summon more Companion Beasts to probe his strength.”</p>
<p>Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan didn’t say a word as Lance said with a smile, “Uncle Li, don’t worry. If the move he already knows about can injure him, he won’t be Zhou Wen.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing Lance’s words, Li Benyu couldn’t help but be surprised.</p>
<p>Lance was a very hardworking person, and his talent was unparalleled.</p>
<p>Although he had lost to Joseph, most people in the Ultimate Family Clan didn’t believe that it was a true defeat.</p>
<p>This was because Lance didn’t contract a Guardian or use a Mythical Companion Beast. It was an unfair battle against Joseph, so the Ultimate Family Clan’s importance of Lance didn’t decrease at all.</p>
<p>Li Benyu had never seen Lance praise others in such a tone. Even an elite like Sadie had never been praised by Lance like this.</p>
<p>Li Benyi also said confidently, “Dad, don’t worry. With Tyrant Behemoth and Tai Sui around, Zhou Wen will definitely win.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?” Li Benyu looked at Zhou Wen in disbelief. He didn’t know what kind of magic Zhou Wen had that made these people so confident in him. It could be said that it was blind faith.</p>
<p>In the arena, Zhou Wen wasn’t angered by Joseph’s provocation. He said without a change in expression, “There’s no need for Tyrant Behemoth to deal with you. Just summoning a Companion Beast is sufficient.”</p>
<p>The moment Zhou Wen said that, the crowd booed. To the locals of Frost City, Zhou Wen’s words were too arrogant.</p>
<p>Although Joseph didn’t dare say that he was invincible, he had a Guardian after all. On the rankings, only a Guardian could surpass a Guardian on the rankings. Even if Lie was defeated, it wasn’t something any Companion Beast could defeat.</p>
<p>“Is that so? Then just randomly summon a Companion Beast. I’ll stand here motionless and see how you defeat me,” said Joseph coldly as a cold glint flashed in his eyes.</p>
<p>The people of Frost City cheered for Joseph. Zhou Wen only smiled. “Stand still? I hope you will do as you say.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have the right to make me move,” Joseph continued provocatively.</p>
<p>He wasn’t doing it purely for his reputation, but to infuriate Zhou Wen and get him to use all his strength. The more serious his injuries were, the stronger the Guardian would be.</p>
<p>Lie had a skill called Hypocritical Transaction. When using this skill, the damage he suffered would be transferred to the opponent who injured him.</p>
<p>However, Hypocritical Transaction had a time limit. He only had a few seconds for the transaction, so he wanted to infuriate Zhou Wen and get his Companion Beast to attack with all its might. After transferring the power that was released, in the span of a few seconds, there was a possibility of directly killing the other party’s Companion Beast.</p>
<p>He wanted Zhou Wen to lose a Mythical Companion Beast first. This was the price Zhou Wen had to pay for underestimating him.</p>
<p>The reason why Joseph dared to challenge Zhou Wen was because of the existence of this move. This was a skill that was the nemesis of Tyrant Behemoth. The stronger Tyrant Behemoth was, the higher the possibility of death.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else as he summoned a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at the short sword beside Zhou Wen in surprise. It was a red sheathed short sword that was about a foot long. The hilt resembled the head of a phoenix, making it look extremely exquisite.</p>
<p>They had never seen such a Companion Beast before and didn’t know its origins. However, they were somewhat disappointed that Tyrant Behemoth wasn’t summoned.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth’s domineering stance of invincibility was something they had admired. They never expected Zhou Wen to summon a short sword that didn’t look domineering at all.</p>
<p>Li Benyi, Lance, and company were also intrigued. They didn’t know what was so special about the short sword Zhou Wen had summoned. They wondered if it could really be effective on Joseph.</p>
<p>“What Companion Beast is that sword? Is it very powerful? Why didn’t he use Tyrant Behemoth and Tai Sui?” Li Benyi looked at Lance in puzzlement, hoping that he could answer his doubts.</p>
<p>Lance looked at the Bronze Sparrow Sword in front of Zhou Wen and said, “From the aura of that sword, it should be a fire-elemental Mythical Companion Beast. It being a sword and fire-elemental in nature, there’s no doubt that it’s a Companion Beast with extremely high offensive strength. However, Joseph has the ability to transfer damage. It’s very risky to use such a Companion Beast to attack Joseph. However, Zhou Wen definitely has his own plans. We’ll just watch.”</p>
<p>Li Benyi also became nervous when Lance said that.</p>
<p>Li Benyu’s judgment was the same as Lance’s. He also felt that it was clearly irrational for Zhou Wen to use such a Companion Beast to fight Joseph.</p>
<p>The best way to deal with an ability that could exchange damage was to use Companion Beasts with the ability to confine the opponent’s body. This was a more normal solution.</p>
<p>Clearly, Zhou Wen didn’t have such plans.</p>
<p>“Are you ready?” Zhou Wen held the Bronze Sparrow Sword and asked Joseph.</p>
<p>“Anytime. However, such a crappy sword probably can’t injure me. It’s best you summon Tyrant Behemoth,” Joseph mocked.</p>
<p>“Since you’re ready, make sure you don’t move,” Zhou Wen said as he unsheathed his sword. The fiery-red Bronze Sparrow Sword tore out of its scabbard and stabbed at Joseph with a tornado-like inferno.</p>
<p>With the augmentation of Vajra Drill, the Bronze Sparrow Sword instantly appeared in front of Joseph and stabbed into his chest.</p>
<p>Well done! Joseph wasn’t alarmed but delighted. Such a violent attack meant that the sword-shaped Companion Beast was indeed very strong. It was enough to teach Zhou Wen a lesson by killing it first.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1001'>Chapter 1001: Not Moving</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>A faint fog seemed to appear on Joseph’s mysterious gray armor. The Bronze Sparrow Sword pierced through the armor and his chest. The tip of the sword was revealed behind him as flames burned crazily.</p>
<p>“Die!” Joseph felt that such an attack was already powerful enough. He steeled his heart and wanted to transfer his injuries to the Bronze Sparrow Sword.</p>
<p>As the Bronze Sparrow Sword had injured him, he could only transfer it to the Bronze Sparrow Sword and not Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, before he could use Hypocritical Transaction to transfer his injuries, the Bronze Sparrow Sword had already exploded. A terrifying explosive force exploded in Joseph’s body like a nuclear bomb.</p>
<p>Not good! Joseph’s expression changed drastically. The explosion of the Bronze Sparrow Sword instantly made him lose his target of damage transfer. Ignoring the fact that his injuries couldn’t be transferred, even Lie probably couldn’t withstand such a terrifying explosion.</p>
<p>Almost instantly, Joseph activated Lie’s Wheel of Destiny: False God Statue.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Joseph’s body was blasted apart by the flames, shocking everyone watching. No one expected such a situation to happen.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Joseph’s figure suddenly appeared in a corner of the arena as he half-knelt on the ground. He wasn’t blasted to death. What was blasted to death was a fake statue that was akin to an avatar.</p>
<p>However, the injuries he had suffered previously couldn’t be transferred out. His chest was dripping with blood as his face turned pale. He looked like he was in a terrible condition.</p>
<p>In the silent arena, Zhou Wen held the Bronze Sparrow Sword’s scabbard which spewed out flames. It condensed a new Bronze Sparrow Sword that looked flawless.</p>
<p>“Wow! Too powerful… What kind of Companion Beast is that? It’s so cool. I’ve decided! I’ll create such Companion Beast figurines in the future…” Li Benyi exclaimed excitedly.</p>
<p>Li Benyu wore an odd expression. Zhou Wen’s strike had indeed exceeded his imagination.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say you were not going to move?” Zhou Wen asked Joseph.</p>
<p>“You… pulled a trick…” Joseph’s expression turned nasty as he gritted his teeth and stood up. He stared at Zhou Wen and continued, “Don’t be too smug. Schemes can only last for a while. In front of true strength, scheming is useless. I’ll let you know what true strength is.”</p>
<p>With that said, the Guardian armor on Joseph’s body emitted a mysterious fog. His injured chest and armor rapidly recovered in the mysterious fog. In the blink of an eye, he returned to normal as though he had never been injured.</p>
<p>What powerful recovery ability. It’s actually stronger than my self-healing ability? Li Xuan widened his eyes in disbelief.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, that shouldn’t be ordinary self-healing, right?” Feng Qiuyan said after some thought.</p>
<p>Sadie used the Eye of Odin to see more clearly. She said, “It really doesn’t look like self-healing. It’s more like some kind of time-reversal ability that reverts his state to before he was injured.”</p>
<p>“That works too? Isn’t this too much of a bug? Such a scumbag actually has such a powerful Guardian. How depressing,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Lance pondered and said, “I don’t think it’s that easy to use such a powerful force like reversing the flow of time. Perhaps, Joseph needs to pay a certain price.”</p>
<p>“What kind of price could it be?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Lance shook his head.</p>
<p>In the spectator stands, many people from Frost City began shouting Joseph’s name in unison.</p>
<p>To be able to escape from such a huge explosion and instantly recover from his injuries, he looked as powerful as a god.</p>
<p>However, they didn’t dare underestimate Zhou Wen now. The strike from the Bronze Sparrow Sword had left them somewhat horrified. Even now, they still felt their scalps tingle when they thought of that strike.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, are you prepared to suffer the wrath of God’s chosen one?” Joseph said coldly as he stared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned some armor and put it on. He said with a smile, “Since you can’t abide by the agreement, it’s my turn to stand here motionless and let you attack. Feel free to attack. I’m always a man of my word. I won’t run.”</p>
<p>These words made Joseph’s expression turn nasty. He originally imagined that he could use Hypocritical Transaction to teach Zhou Wen a lesson, but he never expected Zhou Wen to counter him.</p>
<p>Now, Joseph knew that he had to suppress Zhou Wen to protect the image he had painstakingly built up in Frost City.</p>
<p>“You are tempting fate.” Joseph’s figure appeared in front of Zhou Wen like a phantom as he punched him in the chest.</p>
<p>Unlike ordinary people’s boxing techniques, there was a ring on the middle finger of Joseph’s fist. There was a spike on the ring. It was a poison spike that came with Lie’s armor. Coupled with the use of Essence Energy’s Sweet-Talking Punch, the poison produced when the poisonous sting stabbed into one’s body could make one hallucinate.</p>
<p>Even if Joseph didn’t kill Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen would still fall into an illusion. If his will wasn’t firm, he would commit suicide even without needing Joseph to do a thing.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>However, when Joseph’s fist struck Zhou Wen’s body, the poisonous sting failed to penetrate the armor at all. Under the powerful impact, the poisonous sting nearly snapped, but the armor remained unharmed.</p>
<p>“Impossible? How can it have such powerful defense?” Joseph refused to believe that his Guardian powers couldn’t break through Zhou Wen’s armor.</p>
<p>With that, Joseph quickly moved as he brandished his fists and struck Zhou Wen with all his might.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wore the Shell Dragon Armor and had activated Absolute Defense. No matter how Joseph attacked, he couldn’t break through the armor.</p>
<p>No matter how strong Lie was, it hadn’t activated its Terror form. It was just too difficult to break through the Absolute Defense. Back then, Night Thearch hadn’t been able to directly penetrate the Absolute Defense, much less Joseph.</p>
<p>The people in the spectator stands were dumbfounded. Zhou Wen really stood there motionless, allowing Joseph to attack.</p>
<p>In their eyes, the god-like Joseph was now a weak child. No matter how he attacked, he couldn’t injure Zhou Wen at all.</p>
<p>That fellow… What’s going on… A strange thought arose in many people’s hearts as they looked at Zhou Wen who was dressed in blue crystal armor as though he was protected by the stars.</p>
<p>Could it be that the strength of a Companion Beast is really stronger than a Guardian? Although they were unwilling to believe it deep down, the image of a Guardian suddenly didn’t seem so lofty in their hearts when they saw Joseph fighting an adult like a child.</p>
<p>“What Companion Beast is this? It’s so powerful. Joseph can’t even leave a mark on the armor. It’s just too powerful…” Li Benyi’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Ya’er glanced at Li Benyi and felt that this fellow was so noisy as if he had never seen anything.</p>

<h3 id='chapter1002'>Chapter 1002: Subversion</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The spectator stands were dead silent as everyone stared blankly at the battle in the arena.</p>
<p>Perhaps it couldn’t be called a battle. It was like a naughty child challenging a giant. Even if the giant stood there without moving, the naughty child couldn’t injure the giant at all.</p>
<p>Just as Joseph had said, it seemed to be the difference in absolute strength.</p>
<p>“Why… Why is this happening… Why can’t I break it…” Joseph changed his skills in an attempt to break through Zhou Wen’s armor.</p>
<p>However, it was completely useless. No matter what skill he used, it was blocked by the crystal-like armor. It couldn’t injure Zhou Wen at all.</p>
<p>Joseph’s heart sank to the bottom. He never imagined that he would lose to Zhou Wen, nor did he believe that he, who had a Guardian, couldn’t defeat a human without a contracted Guardian.</p>
<p>However, the truth was right before him. His heart was already palpitating, and his hands were trembling even more because he couldn’t see any hope of victory.</p>
<p>Now, Joseph was already regretting his decision to challenge Zhou Wen. Why did this darn Zhou Wen have so many terrifying Companion Beasts?</p>
<p>“Even if I kill you, you won’t be able to kill me. From the looks of it, there’s no need to continue fighting. This battle is a draw,” said Joseph as he suddenly retreated. He still wanted to preserve his final dignity.</p>
<p>However, his words made even the locals who had supported him find it unacceptable. All of them felt their faces burn.</p>
<p>“A loss is a loss. What do you mean by a draw? Can’t you act like a man?” a hot-tempered man in the stands shouted.</p>
<p>This was also what many people thought. They felt that Joseph should fight to the end. Even if he lost, it wouldn’t be as embarrassing as now.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Joseph without any expression. All he did was slowly dispel the Shell Dragon Armor and Bronze Sparrow Sword. He held the Bamboo Blade and said, “I won’t use any Companion Beasts. I’ll only use this Essence Gold Bamboo Blade to fight you. Do you dare fight?”</p>
<p>Instantly, the entire arena fell silent. Everyone suspected that there was something wrong with their ears or that Zhou Wen had gone mad.</p>
<p>The highest level humans could reach was the Epic stage. If they didn’t use Mythical Companion Beasts, they had no right to fight Guardians.</p>
<p>They admitted that Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts were very strong. They were practically invincible. Without using Tyrant Behemoth, he had completely suppressed Joseph, who had a Guardian.</p>
<p>However, this didn’t mean that they believed that Zhou Wen was qualified to fight Joseph without a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“Are you sure there’s nothing wrong with his brain?” Li Benyu was also stunned. He was originally rejoicing over Zhou Wen’s victory, but, to his surprise, Zhou Wen had said such crazy words.</p>
<p>Lance also stared at Zhou Wen with a burning gaze. He knew what Zhou Wen wanted to do because he had done the same thing, but he had failed.</p>
<p>“Of course he’s not crazy. He just wants to prove that a Guardian is nothing impressive. We humans can defeat a Guardian with our own strength,” Sadie said with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>Although this sounded terrifying, Sadie didn’t find it strange that Zhou Wen was capable of completing such a feat.</p>
<p>“But… Can humans really defeat Guardians?” Li Benyu couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>Li Benyi also couldn’t believe it. He muttered to himself, “Using a human’s body to defeat a Guardian? Is that possible?”</p>
<p>Apart from Li Xuan, Feng Qiuyan, and Ya’er, no one in Frost City believed that Zhou Wen could do it.</p>
<p>Humans maxed out at the Epic stage. There was a huge gap between them and the Mythical stage. As for Guardians, they were the best amongst those at the Mythical stage. The difference between them was just too great. The gap was so wide that no one could see hope.</p>
<p>“Is he crazy? Without using a Companion Beast, he’s only at the Epic stage. What right does he have to fight the Guardian?”</p>
<p>“Victory blinds one.”</p>
<p>“I think victory makes people crazy.”</p>
<p>When the people in the stands snapped to their senses, they began discussing spiritedly. Clearly, they also felt that Zhou Wen had been blinded by victory.</p>
<p>“Are you really not going to use a Companion Beast to fight me?” Joseph looked at Zhou Wen in disbelief. He couldn’t believe that a person like Zhou Wen would make such a foolish decision.</p>
<p>“If I use a Companion Beast, even if it’s only at the Legendary stage, it will be considered my loss.” Zhou Wen immediately added, “However, I have a condition.”</p>
<p>“What condition?” Joseph found it normal. There was no reason for Zhou Wen to be such an idiot.</p>
<p>“Even if I lose using a Companion Beast, this battle can’t end before I admit defeat. Do you dare accept the challenge?” Zhou Wen had been observing the powers of Lie.</p>
<p>It was indeed a very strong Guardian. Although it wasn’t the kind with absolute strength, his abilities were unique.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was confident that he could defeat Joseph, who had Lie, but he wasn’t completely confident that he could completely destroy Lie before Joseph admitted defeat.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen had to force Joseph not to admit defeat. He had to fight him to the end.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Zhou Wen in shock, believing that he had definitely gone mad. How was this a condition? It was as though he had personally delivered himself to the gallows.</p>
<p>Joseph stared at Zhou Wen with bloodshot eyes. He felt like he had been greatly insulted.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to beat around the bush. Aren’t you just trying to say that we won’t rest until one of us dies? I’ll fulfill your wish. We won’t rest until one of us dies. However, if you use a Companion Beast, it will be your loss. I want you to commit suicide.” Joseph’s eyes were red as his face couldn’t help but grimace. His voice was filled with ruthlessness.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.</p>
<p>“Everyone, you heard that, right? As a member of the Ultimate Family Clan, you can guarantee me fair treatment, right?” Joseph looked at the VIP stands in the arena and said.</p>
<p>There, the upper echelons of the Ultimate Family Clan were watching the battle.</p>
<p>“No one can violate the agreement here,” an elder said calmly as he walked to the stands.</p>
<p>Joseph was delighted when he saw the elder. He bowed respectfully before turning to Zhou Wen with a ferocious expression. “Zhou Wen, I’ll gladly accept your life.”</p>
<p>With that said, the Lie Guardian armor on Joseph’s body emitted a mysterious fog that charged at Zhou Wen with terrifying power.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already analyzed the various abilities of Lie back when Joseph attacked. He already had an idea of its strength.</p>
<p>He held the Bamboo Blade, but he didn’t pull it out of its scabbard. As though riding the wind and smoke like an immortal, he dodged Joseph’s strange attacks.</p>
<p>Everyone saw that Zhou Wen really didn’t use a Companion Beast and relied solely on his strength to fight Joseph. Furthermore, Joseph didn’t have the absolute advantage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s elegant movement technique that resembled a transcendent flying immortal was deeply imprinted in many people’s minds.</p>
<p>“Can humans… really compete with Guardians?” The people who rejected the notion previously had their beliefs shaken.</p>
<p>That elegant figure was subverting their long-established beliefs.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1003'>Chapter 1003: Slaying the Guardian</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen’s movement techniques and saber techniques were pleasing to the eye and looked extremely elegant.</p>
<p>Even with the help of the Guardian’s powers, Joseph’s Speed and Strength were stronger than Zhou Wen’s in all aspects; yet, he was ultimately unable to injure him.</p>
<p>Even ordinary people who didn’t know how strong or weak their combat strength was could tell that although Joseph’s Strength and Speed were great, his technique and realm were far inferior to Zhou Wen’s.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen relied solely on his technique and combat experience to forcefully make up for the difference in physique between the two.</p>
<p>The Mythical Transcendent Flying Immortal combined with the Mythical Heart Defying Sword made Zhou Wen appear no weaker in his battle with Joseph.</p>
<p>Joseph was alarmed. He believed that after having a Guardian, he was already one of the strongest humans. Ignoring normal humans, even people with Mythical Companion Beasts were probably no match for him.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t even use a Companion Beast. Just his strength, skills, and Essence Gold saber were enough to render him helpless. It was rather terrifying.</p>
<p>Joseph made up his mind. Previously, he had that strange sword that prevented the Guardian’s Hypocritical Transaction from finding a target to transfer. Now that he can’t use Companion Beasts, I don’t believe that he can withstand the damage transfer. He can’t self-destruct, right?</p>
<p>However, with his previous experience, Joseph didn’t dare be careless against Zhou Wen. Although he felt that this move was feasible, he couldn’t activate the Wheel of Destiny again anytime soon. If his life ended up in danger, he couldn’t use the False God Statue to escape.</p>
<p>To prevent any accidents, Joseph made a decision.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used the Bamboo Blade as a sword and used the Heart Defying Sword to perfection. The might of his sword moves also became stronger.</p>
<p>As for Joseph, he seemed to be completely suppressed by Zhou Wen. He seemed to be retreating in defeat.</p>
<p>The spectators were already dumbfounded when they saw this. They couldn’t believe that an Epic human could suppress Joseph, who had a Guardian.</p>
<p>“Joseph seems to be deliberately luring Zhou Wen into delivering greater might with his sword,” Sadie said.</p>
<p>“That’s indeed the case. From the looks of it, he still plans on using that damage transfer ability,” said Lance.</p>
<p>“He still hasn’t learned his lesson after suffering a loss. He just has to do it again,” Li Xuan said with a curl of his lips.</p>
<p>“The situation now is probably a little different. Zhou Wen is using an ordinary Essence Gold weapon and not a saber transformed from a Companion Beast. It’s impossible for him to let the Bamboo Blade leave his hand to attack Joseph. If the damage is transferred, it can be transferred to Zhou Wen. Even if Zhou Wen were to throw the saber out, Zhou Wen’s situation will be very bad if the saber is destroyed,” Gulli said.</p>
<p>Lance thought for a moment, but he couldn’t think of a way for Zhou Wen to nullify the damage transfer. He pondered and said, “Since Zhou Wen has agreed not to use Companion Beasts, there should be a solution. Let’s continue watching.”</p>
<p>With Joseph luring Zhou Wen to use greater strength, Zhou Wen’s might grew stronger and stronger. This was also what Joseph wanted. He wanted to use damage transfer to kill Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Seeing that the time was ripe, Zhou Wen’s sword stance was like a storm. It was impossible for him to retract his force.</p>
<p>Joseph suddenly retreated, but the armor on his body condensed into a Guardian that looked like a devil. It faced the Bamboo Blade in Zhou Wen’s hand.</p>
<p>Bamboo Blade crisscrossed over Lie’s body like bolts of lightning, leaving deep marks on its body.</p>
<p>Without the augmentation of Mythical Strength, Zhou Wen’s Strength was still a little weak. The injuries he left on Lie weren’t deep.</p>
<p>Joseph was delighted when he saw this. Zhou Wen’s strength wasn’t as terrifying as he imagined. It was completely within the limits of Lie.</p>
<p>However, such a violent sword attack left many wounds in a short period of time. Even if these injuries couldn’t kill Zhou Wen, they could reduce him to a heavily injured state.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you’re dead.” Joseph roared as he excitedly launched Hypocritical Transaction to transfer the Guardian’s injuries to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, the excitement on Joseph’s face froze. He realized that the Guardian’s injuries couldn’t be transferred to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Impossible… How can this be… You cheated… You used the power of a Companion Beast to withstand the Guardian’s damage transfer?” Joseph roared at Zhou Wen with bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p>The people in the spectator stands also felt that what Joseph said wasn’t impossible. Otherwise, how could Zhou Wen, an Epic-stage human, suppress the Guardian so badly?</p>
<p>“Do I need to cheat?” Zhou Wen said calmly as the Bamboo Blade’s aura suddenly increased.</p>
<p>Instantly, Zhou Wen’s aura reached a terrifying level. At the instant he brandished the Bamboo Blade in his hand, he seemed to vanish.</p>
<p>When he appeared again, he was already at the other end of the arena. He slowly returned Bamboo Blade to its scabbard.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>And in the sky, Lie’s body split into two and was killed on the spot.</p>
<p>Not far behind the Guardian, Joseph spat out a mouthful of blood and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The arena was silent. Those who had doubted Zhou Wen moments ago now felt the coldness deep in their bones.</p>
<p>Is there a need to cheat? It really doesn’t seem like there’s a need. This thought appeared in everyone’s minds.</p>
<p>The strength of humans can really kill Guardians! Apart from that, an unbelievable thought sprouted in everyone’s hearts.</p>
<p>“You cheated… You cheated… It’s impossible for human strength to defeat a Guardian… It’s impossible for you to defeat me, a chosen one of God… You must be cheating…” The wounds on Joseph’s body were still bleeding, but he seemed to have gone mad. He ignored his injuries and struggled to get up and shout.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t kill him. After all, he was from the Ultimate Family Clan. It was better to leave him to the Ultimate Family Clan to deal with.</p>
<p>He originally imagined that the matter would end here, but gray smoke suddenly rose from Joseph’s body as though his body was turning into dust.</p>
<p>As for the smoke, it condensed into the appearance of Lie above Joseph.</p>
<p>This strange scene left everyone horrified. As Joseph constantly screamed, his body quickly dissipated, and the smoke transformed into the complete Lie.</p>
<p>However, the current Lie looked much more agile and strange than the previous Lie.</p>
<p>“What happened? Aren’t Guardians supposed to protect contractors? Why did it devour Joseph?” Everyone felt their blood run cold.</p>
<p>Lie floated in the air as it looked at Zhou Wen with its demonic eyes and said, “You defeated Joseph. Now, you have the right to succeed Joseph as God’s chosen one. I will bestow you supreme power.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1004'>Chapter 1004: Frod</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen only looked at Lie without saying a word.</p>
<p>He had plotted to kill the Guardian, but the other party hadn’t died. Instead, he had devoured the puppet-like Joseph. This Guardian seemed to be stronger than Zhou Wen imagined.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen remain silent, Lie continued, “Don’t think that defeating Joseph means defeating me. In fact, my true strength far exceeds what you see. It’s just that Joseph can’t use my true strength. However, you are different. With your ability, you can perfectly unleash my strength. When the time comes, we can defeat many Guardians and become the King of Earth.”</p>
<p>With that said, the gray smoke on the Guardian rose and instantly enveloped the entire arena. As for the people in the arena, they realized that they couldn’t control their bodies.</p>
<p>All of them began clapping like puppets as they shouted in unison, “Become the Kings of Earth together…”</p>
<p>Everyone was horrified. Their minds were very lucid, but for some reason, their bodies didn’t listen to them at all. It was as though they were controlled by a devil.</p>
<p>“Is this the true power of a Guardian?” Everyone was alarmed, angry, and afraid.</p>
<p>“How about it? As long as you contract with me, you will have the supreme divine power to control everything. You will become the true King of Earth.” Lie floated in the air and looked down at the entire arena like a god. It was as though the humans in the arena were ants that he could toy with.</p>
<p>“I’m not interested in losers,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“If you have any doubts about my strength, you can use all your strength. Try again and see if you can injure me,” Lie continued arrogantly. “Of course, I’m different from trash like Joseph. You can use any Companion Beast or external force as you wish without any qualms.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Then I really want to give it a try,” Zhou Wen said calmly.</p>
<p>“Then what are you waiting for? Do it now. Reveal your strongest strength and your strongest Companion Beast. I’ll let you know what a true Guardian is. I’m completely different from that trash, Joseph. This is the true Guardian’s strength,” Lie said.</p>
<p>“Since you think Joseph is trash, why did you contract him?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Humans are mostly trash. There was no better choice. We can only make do by choosing trash with a suitable physique. However, since there’s a human like you, I naturally don’t need that useless trash,” Lie said.</p>
<p>“Is that so? Then let me see how strong you are.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he summoned the Tyrant Behemoth boxing glove and threw a punch at the levitating Lie.</p>
<p>“A boxing glove with Absolute Strength? Such strength might be useful against other Guardians, but to me… It’s useless… Bam…” Before Lie could finish his sentence, Zhou Wen struck him in the chest.</p>
<p>However, Lie didn’t realize that just as Zhou Wen’s boxing glove was about to hit him, a crystalline blue thread appeared in the boxing glove. It stabbed into Lie’s body with a terrifying icy aura.</p>
<p>In an instant, Lie’s body froze. Following that, the Absolute Strength-powered punch blasted the frozen body into ice fragments.</p>
<p>Just like that, Lie was killed with a single punch. He couldn’t even use Hypocritical Transaction. The controlled people immediately regained their freedom. The fog in the arena dissipated as warm sunlight scattered down, bathing Zhou Wen in sunlight.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, you are also trash,” Zhou Wen said coldly as he looked at the ice shards that filled the sky.</p>
<p>For some reason, the people who were very concerned about Zhou Wen defeating Joseph felt an inexplicable sense of joy when they heard Zhou Wen’s words.</p>
<p>“He’s so powerful… Zhou Wen is really so powerful…” Li Benyi was so excited that he was incoherent.</p>
<p>Li Benyu was already dumbfounded. This was the first time he had seen such a person. He didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>“F*ck it. Guardians aren’t that impressive. They’re just trash. They can’t even withstand a single punch from Zhou Wen.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. What trash Guardians? We humans are the strongest.”</p>
<p>“How can I become as strong as Zhou Wen? I also want to kill those detestable Guardians.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The beliefs in Frost City seemed to change in an extremely short period of time. The belief that Guardians were invincible was slowly fading.</p>
<p>Although it was impossible for them to completely change because of this matter, at least there was already a seed of restlessness sprouting in their hearts.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I originally wanted to hand Joseph over to you, but I never expected…” Zhou Wen returned to the lounge and said apologetically to Lance, Sadie, and Gulli.</p>
<p>“This has nothing to do with you, but there’s something I hope you can help me with,” Lance said.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“My great-grandfather wants to meet you,” Lance said seriously.</p>
<p>“I should greet the elders,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Follow me. This might be a little different from the elder you imagine.” Lance only invited Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Li Xuan, Feng Qiuyan, and Ya’er had to wait outside. They weren’t on the invitation list.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally believed that no matter how bad Lance’s great-grandfather’s personality was, he wouldn’t bicker with him on account of Lance and Sadie.</p>
<p>However, when he really saw Lance’s great-grandfather, he realized that it wasn’t what he had imagined.</p>
<p>Lance took Zhou Wen to the depths of Frost City. It was a place that resembled an ice cave that had existed for billions of years. And on the ice wall of the ice cave, there was a humanoid sculpture.</p>
<p>One could see that the sculpture was a very majestic elder, but there were no signs of it being a man-made carving. It was as though the elder’s ice sculpture had grown out of the ice wall.</p>
<p>“Great-grandfather… I brought Zhou Wen here…” When Lance bowed at the ice sculpture, his words left Zhou Wen dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“Hello, Zhou Wen. I’m Frod.” The ice sculpture actually spoke. Furthermore, the name he said left Zhou Wen even more alarmed.</p>
<p>“Frod? Could it be that you are one of the six heroes, Frod?” Zhou Wen had learned this name countless times in his textbooks, so he naturally wouldn’t forget it.</p>
<p>However, according to what Zhou Wen knew, other than the old hero from the Dugu family, the other five heroes should have passed away.</p>
<p>Even if Frod was still alive, he couldn’t be an ice sculpture, right?</p>
<h3 id='chapter1005'>Chapter 1005: Flaws of the Six Heroes</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“You don’t have to be so surprised. He’s indeed our family’s hero and pride, my great-grandfather, Frod,” Lance said.</p>
<p>“But…” Zhou Wen looked at Frod in the ice wall. No matter how he looked at him, it was just an ice sculpture. Apart from having a humanoid shape, it didn’t have any human characteristics.</p>
<p>The ice sculpture-like Frod revealed a smile. “The reason I became like this is because I violated the agreement with the holy temple. If you are interested, I can tell you the story.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally wanted to know. He knew too little about the older generation.</p>
<p>“Back then, Zhang Daotian, Xia Jiuhuang, and I were still very young. We were about the same age as you…” Frod slowly said as he sank into his memories.</p>
<p>When the dimensional storms descended, many unknown mysterious areas appeared in the human world. Many people died because they found themselves in the mysterious areas. Many deranged people obtained powers that were akin to superpowers. Human society nearly collapsed.</p>
<p>At that moment, six youths stood forward and used their strength to defeat all the great devils. They expelled them overseas and established a new order—the current Federation.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>The six youths were naturally the six heroes of the past.</p>
<p>However, Frod’s story was somewhat different from the legend of the six heroes. According to him, there was no such thing as six heroes because there were many young people who had entered the Holy Land with them.</p>
<p>Among the people who came out of the Holy Land, eventually, six of them were the most famous. Furthermore, they established the Federation government, so they became the legend of the six heroes.</p>
<p>“In fact, many of the people who entered the Holy Land with us back then had talent that wasn’t inferior to the six of us. They were even stronger than us. For example, Jing Daoxian’s talent far exceeded the six of us. Unfortunately, he didn’t obtain the recognition of the six Holy Temples, nor did he obtain a special physique.” When Frod said that, his expression turned odd. “However, Jing Daoxian’s failure might not be a bad thing. This is because although we were glorious when we obtained the special physiques and Companion Beasts, something unimaginable happened later.”</p>
<p>“What happened?” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>“The physiques given to us by the six Holy Temples all have different flaws, but we didn’t know about them beforehand,” Frod answered.</p>
<p>“What flaws?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>“For example, Xia Jiuhuang’s Connate Sacred Body is an almost undying physique. However, a Connate Sacred Body has to maintain its virginity. Once one loses their virginity, the Connate Sacred Body will be gone. The other five physiques also have various strange flaws, but they aren’t as obvious as the Connate Sacred Body.”</p>
<p>Frod paused for a moment before continuing, “Due to the existence of these flaws, we had no choice but to think of a way to resolve them. However, no matter what method we used, we were unable to make up for them. Therefore, in order to prevent our flaws from being exploited by others, we had no choice but to think of various methods. The easiest way to resolve them was to seek help from the Holy Temple.”</p>
<p>“In that case, the Holy Temple is using these special physiques to threaten you?” Zhou Wen understood what Frod meant.</p>
<p>“That’s right. On the surface, the six of us are the six heroes of the Federation, but in fact, we are just puppets of the Holy Temple. During that period of time, many of the things we did came from the Holy Temple’s orders, including the establishment of the Federation government.” Frod revealed a secret that left Zhou Wen shocked beyond belief.</p>
<p>“Could it be that… the Federation government is actually just a puppet government?” Zhou Wen widened his eyes.</p>
<p>Frod shook his head. “Not entirely. In fact, the six families are secretly searching for a way to resolve their problems in order to escape the Holy Temple’s control.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, it’s a huge mistake if the Holy Temple thinks that they can completely control us like this.” Frod said indifferently, “It’s precisely because I disobeyed the Holy Temple’s orders that they made use of the weakness in my physique to turn me into this. The other fellows also did the same thing openly or secretly. Therefore, although the Holy Temple has a huge influence on the Federation, they don’t have absolute influence because they can’t descend personally.</p>
<p>“In addition, Wang Mingyuan had previously used the power of the Holy Temple to weaken the connection between the Holy Land and Earth. This decreased the influence again, but it still can’t be underestimated. If the Holy Temple insists on doing something, they will have many ways to achieve their goals. The six hero families aren’t completely united,” said Frod.</p>
<p>“You didn’t invite me here just to tell me this, right?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Frod looked at Zhou Wen with an odd expression. After a long while, he said, “I got Lance to invite you here because I wish you to help me and my family do something. If this can be done, perhaps our family can completely escape the control of the Holy Temple.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you thinking too highly of me?” Zhou Wen had entered the Holy Land before and had visited a few Holy Temples. He knew that there were extremely terrifying existences there.</p>
<p>In the past, he had only felt that they were strong. Now that he thought about it, the existences in the temple were likely all at the Terror grade or even stronger.</p>
<p>Frod smiled and said, “If you can do it, it will be very beneficial to you.”</p>
<p>“Can you tell me what it is?” Zhou Wen was still very curious.</p>
<p>“In the Maze of Lies, there’s the mask of the God of Mischief. Only by obtaining that mask can we use the power of the mask to escape the influence of the special physique. I hope you can help us obtain that mask.” Frod paused before saying, “In return, I’ll tell you a secret regarding the Holy Land. You will definitely be interested in it.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Frod with an odd expression. Although he was Lance’s elder, he didn’t have any intention of helping him considering how he was being so vague.</p>
<p>From Zhou Wen’s expression, Frod knew what he was thinking. Therefore, he said, “This secret is related to the disappearance of Professor Ouyang Ting and company. You are very concerned about this matter, right?”</p>
<p>“Professor Ouyang Ting went missing in Zhuolu. It has nothing to do with the Holy Land.” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>Frod smiled and said, “Child, the six Holy Temples represent the six strongest races of the dimension. Zhuolu is the battlefield of the divine war between two of the races. And you think it’s unrelated?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Frod with some hesitation because he wasn’t sure if he could believe him.</p>
<p>To others, the six heroes might be extremely lofty existences, but Zhou Wen had seen Xia Jiuhuang’s horror and knew that they were actually different from the heroes spoken about in legend.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1006'>Chapter 1006: Don’t Board the Ship</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen hesitate, Frod continued, “Although dimensional creatures appear on Earth in the form of higher-level lifeforms and are very similar to the legendary gods, through the years of contact with them and the things they have done, it’s very likely that Earth isn’t as low-level as they say. Or rather, there’s something they need on Earth. That’s why they didn’t hesitate to descend to Earth and incite humans to wage war. In the end, it even evolved into a war between gods.”</p>
<p>“I once heard that there’s a saying in the dimension that Earth is the birthplace of all dimensional creatures,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“This theory is novel, but it’s not impossible.” Frod continued, “I’ve secretly studied it before. I discovered that there have been traces of special forces behind every large-scale war in history. The older the era, the more obvious the forces behind it are. It’s just like the Zhuolu battle in your East District. After my research, I discovered the traces of many terrifying creatures from the dimension. Furthermore, this has a lot to do with the race that the two temples belong to. I even discovered traces of the two races appearing in the war. The other families clearly discovered something amiss. Someone seemed to have discovered something and wanted to delve deeper. Therefore, Ouyang Ting’s team entered Zhuolu for research.</p>
<p>“After this group entered Zhuolu, many strange things happened. As I was also paying attention to this matter, I once sent people to infiltrate the research team. However, I later realized that the person I sent to the research team had been switched without us realizing it. If it wasn’t for the need for the person to contact us through a special channel every once in a while, we wouldn’t have known that this person had been replaced.”</p>
<p>Frod took a deep breath and continued, “Later on, I sent some people there to test the personnel. Finally, I confirmed that the person was no longer the original him, but even those who were more familiar with him couldn’t find any flaws. Therefore, I checked the rest of the team and discovered many problems. Apart from Ouyang Ting, who was the head of the research team and someone I confirmed to be the actual person, I found many suspicious points on the others.”</p>
<p>“Did you find out who did all this?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“No. Up to now, I still don’t know who did all of this. Even the six families will find it difficult to pull it off. It’s not difficult to replace one or two people, but to replace most of the experts in the research team, not only do the people have to look the same, but they also need to have similar expertise. Otherwise, it will be very difficult to continue the research. At the very least, I can’t think of anyone who can do it,” said Frod.</p>
<p>“Which aspect is the secret you mentioned?” Zhou Wen finally believed that Frod might know something.</p>
<p>He already knew what Frod had said, but there was no progress.</p>
<p>“If my judgment is correct, don’t you find it strange that everyone else has been replaced except Professor Ouyang Ting?” Frod asked.</p>
<p>“Is it because Professor Ouyang Ting’s professional abilities can’t be replaced by others?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“That might be a partial reason. They only changed the people, but they didn’t stop the research from continuing. I’m certain that the mastermind behind this is also very interested in Zhuolu’s research, so Ouyang Ting’s existence is rather important. However, after my investigations and research, I discovered something even more shocking. This has something to do with Professor Ouyang Ting. Perhaps you will be interested.” Frod didn’t continue.</p>
<p>“What’s the mask in the Maze of Lies? A dimensional creature?” Zhou Wen was already tempted. He really wanted to know the truth of the past. He vaguely felt that the truth of the matter wasn’t as simple as the former principal’s life and death.</p>
<p>“It’s not a dimensional creature. It’s an extremely special item. You can treat it as the core of a dimensional zone, or you can treat it as something that suppresses the dimensional zone. If that item is taken away, the restrictions on the dimensional zones will be completely lifted. The dimensional creatures inside will be able to enter and exit freely. Therefore, if you want to take the mask away, the problems with the dimensional creatures inside have to be resolved. We can’t leave any trouble behind, so we need your help,” said Frod.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, In that case, that mask is probably something like the stone saber in Ancient Sovereign City or the jade box in Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen said, “I can promise to do my best, but I can’t guarantee success. I’ll consider my safety first.”</p>
<p>“That’s enough. I believe that with your strength and the strength our family has accumulated over the years, it won’t be difficult for you to control the situation,” said Frod.</p>
<p>“Also, I need full authority. I’ll decide when to enter, when to retreat, and when to take action,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Frod hesitated for a moment before looking at Lance.</p>
<p>Lance nodded slightly. “I believe in Zhou Wen.”</p>
<p>Only then did Frod look at Zhou Wen and say, “In that case, I’ll entrust my family’s lives to you.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Frod continued, “Back then, I had been investigating matters related to the six temples. Zhuolu was one of them. Therefore, before the scientific research team went to Zhuolu, my family had already studied Zhuolu and met Professor Ouyang Ting there. That was more than ten years before the Zhuolu project began.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised. He had always suspected that the former principal had been to Zhuolu before.</p>
<p>Frod sighed softly. “When I met him we chatted a lot. After Professor Ouyang Ting heard about my investigation, he also told me some of his special discoveries in Zhuolu. However, because he needed further research to confirm some of his discoveries, he didn’t say much. Not long after that, I became what I am now. Many things can only be done by others, so I couldn’t communicate with Professor Ouyang Ting further. Later, I don’t know what happened, but Professor Ouyang Ting didn’t continue studying Zhuolu. Instead, he returned to his education work until the Zhuolu project started…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen listened quietly. He knew that Frod was about to get to the point.</p>
<p>As expected, Frod continued, “In fact, after discovering the problem with the people we sent out, I also tried to secretly contact Professor Ouyang Ting. However, at that time, he seemed to realize that his environment wasn’t safe, or that he was secretly being controlled by someone. Therefore, he secretly sent me a message.”</p>
<p>“What message?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“Only four words. Don’t board the ship,” Frod said with a strange expression.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1007'>Chapter 1007: If the Catastrophe Really Existed</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Don’t board the ship? What ship?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement, but he had some thoughts.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“I don’t know what ship he’s talking about either. That’s all he sent. However, other than that, he also sent me a piece of paper that came from a diary and a hand-drawn sketch. There should be a connection between the two.” Frod gestured for Lance to take out a piece of paper from a box beside him for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took the piece of paper and looked at it. He realized that it was indeed a very ordinary piece of diary paper. It wasn’t very big. On one side of the paper was a sketch. It was an anchor with a woman’s side profile.</p>
<p>This picture… When Zhou Wen saw the picture, he immediately felt as though he had grasped something, but he couldn’t make the connections. It was an extremely uncomfortable feeling.</p>
<p>When Frod mentioned the ship, Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that it might be related to the anchor woman he had seen before. Now, he was finally certain that this was the anchor woman.</p>
<p>Perhaps the disappearance of the former principal was related to this symbol.</p>
<p>Don’t board the ship… Could it be… There’s really such a ship… Then, could the missing former principal have boarded this ship? Countless thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind.</p>
<p>Frod continued, “Later on, when I wanted to contact Professor Ouyang Ting, there was a problem with the information network. Before I could deploy more people, something happened to the research team.”</p>
<p>“It would have been fine if something had happened during the research, but after my investigations, that wasn’t the case. The day before Professor Ouyang Ting and company went missing, a batch of things was transported out, but those things mysteriously disappeared. No matter how I investigated, I couldn’t find their whereabouts. If it wasn’t for the information left by the people I had previously planted, I wouldn’t have known that there was such a batch of things,” Frod said.</p>
<p>“What were the items?” Lance was also attracted by the story and couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. The people I planted were only in charge of supplies. They couldn’t enter the core research team. Furthermore, during that period of time, my information network was severely damaged. Only one survived. I only made contact with him a few days after the incident.”</p>
<p>Frod said coldly, “After that, I carefully studied the pattern and the Zhuolu research team. Clearly, someone had deliberately erased all the clues and made it impossible to find anything. However, the pattern has been discovered in some places and investigations bore fruit.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Lance looked at Frod. They wanted to know what the anchor symbol represented.</p>
<p>After studying it for so long, Zhou Wen still couldn’t figure out what it represented.</p>
<p>Frod said, “You should have heard of myths regarding floods, right? No matter which district’s myths or a religion’s legend, there are similar legends of a flood.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded. “There’s indeed a similar flood legend in the East District. Legend has it that the Water God fought the Fire God and slammed into Mt. Buzhou, causing the heavenly pillar to shatter. A huge flood descended from the sky and drowned the entire world.”</p>
<p>Frod nodded and said, “Apart from the myths in your East District, there are many similar myths in the other districts. The ones that are more famous are the religious myths—Noah’s Ark. There are similar legends all over the world. Don’t you think it’s very coincidental? What if this really happened and isn’t a legend?”</p>
<p>“You mean that the anchor symbol originated from Noah’s Ark? Then what does Professor Ouyang Ting mean by not to board the ship? Isn’t Noah’s Ark a ship that saves humans and various creatures in myths?” Zhou Wen felt that this was somewhat contradictory.</p>
<p>However, Frod shook his head and said, “What I mean is the speculation of the flood, not the existence of Noah’s Ark.”</p>
<p>“Is there a difference?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Of course. Before the dimensional storms, research found that the continents that are scattered across the oceans might have been a whole. If there was some force that split the supercontinent, it could explain the flood that happened all over the world. It was because the supercontinent was forcefully separated by some force, resulting in a tidal wave that overwhelmed the entire world. What kind of force could split a supercontinent? In the past, someone raised a theory of continental drift, believing that the supercontinent had split because of the centrifugal force generated by a celestial body’s gravity and Earth’s rotation. However, ever since the appearance of the dimension, I’m more inclined to another explanation.” Frod’s eyes turned sharp.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“What explanation?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Perhaps a dimensional creature cracked the supercontinent,” said Frod.</p>
<p>“But why would they do that? What do they gain from doing so?” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I say that dimensional creatures wanted to find something on Earth? Perhaps that’s why they cracked the supercontinent. Of course, this is only my guess.” Frod continued, “I’ve also discovered that symbol in some places, but they are all places related to dimensional zones. Furthermore, they have been discovered all over the world. I don’t think it’s a coincidence. Perhaps a ship really appeared during the flood, but it wasn’t Noah’s Ark that saved the world. Instead, it was a terrifying creature from a dimensional zone that descended to Earth. They tore through the waves and ripped through the entire supercontinent with a wave of their hands. They directly entered the continent by ship and might have saved some creatures that looked more pleasing to the eye. This then gave rise to the legend of Noah’s Ark…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Lance were dumbfounded when they heard that. To shatter the land with a wave of a hand was a terrifying force.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen felt that it wasn’t impossible. In the division of the Mythical stage, there was still the Calamity grade above the Terror grade. Perhaps a Calamity-grade powerhouse was capable of that.</p>
<p>If there’s really such a ship, is the ship the former principal said not to board the same one? That ship still exists on Earth? Then what about the dimensional creatures on the ship? Countless questions flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure, but there’s one thing I’m certain of. I’ve seen creatures in the Holy Temples. I saw the anchor symbol on their clothes.” Frod’s last sentence reminded Zhou Wen of someone.</p>
<p>Previously, when Zhou Wen entered the Holy Temple, he had encountered an amnesiac named Ah Lai. He said that he had gone out to sea with his father before encountering a storm. However, when he woke up, he found himself inside the Holy Temple.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen suddenly wanted to ask Ah Lai what the captain of the ship looked like.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen felt that the Ah Lai family’s ship was likely different from the ship in the catastrophe, he had a nagging feeling that there might be a connection between Ah Lai’s appearance in the Holy Temple after encountering the storm.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1008'>Chapter 1008: Multiple Dungeons</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>After leaving the underground ice cavern, Zhou Wen was still thinking about what Frod had said.</p>
<p>If the Holy Land was really related to that ship, and they had been in operation for so many years, secretly supporting humans to form the Federation, then their goal was clearly not simple.</p>
<p>What’s on Earth that even Calamity-grade dimensional creatures drool over? Zhou Wen still couldn’t figure it out.</p>
<p>However, he had already realized that Earth was definitely not as inferior as it looked. Many dimensional creatures on Earth had immense potential. Although their levels were relatively low, if they could develop, they might become existences that could make even the dimension tremble.</p>
<p>Ignoring everything else, Zhou Wen was certain that Torch Dragon would be extremely terrifying if it could advance to the Terror or even the Calamity grade in the future.</p>
<p>Agreeing to help Frod didn’t seem like a bad thing for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>He had obtained some information regarding the Maze of Lies from the Ultimate Family Clan. Now, Zhou Wen finally knew why he could only see the Mischief Clown in the Maze of Lies.</p>
<p>This was because the Maze of Lies was actually a very special dimensional zone. This dimensional zone was split into seven different states. From Monday to Sunday, the Maze of Lies would undergo some changes every day.</p>
<p>It happened to be Monday when Zhou Wen cleared the Maze of Lies. This was the weakest day of the Maze of Lies, and there was only Mischief Clown on that day.</p>
<p>After Tuesday, there would be more and more terrifying dimensional creatures in the maze. Before Friday, all kinds of dimensional creatures below the Mythical stage would appear.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Mythical creatures were a certainty. As for the final Sunday, it was the most terrifying day in the Maze of Lies. All kinds of dimensional creatures would undergo huge changes on that day. Even the weakest Mischief Clown would have Mythical powers.</p>
<p>The Maze of Lies that day was no different from an abyssal hell. Furthermore, that was the only day that the mask would only appear.</p>
<p>Even with the Ultimate Family Clan’s present strength, it was impossible for them to conquer the maze on that day, much less kill all the dimensional creatures inside.</p>
<p>This was because after the mask was taken out, the seal on the Maze of Lies would vanish. Therefore, not only did Frod want to obtain the mask, but he also wanted to destroy all the dimensional creatures inside and completely have the Maze of Lies under control. Even if dimensional creatures entered through spatial rifts, it would only be a small number. Furthermore, with preparations in advance, the Ultimate Family Clan could deal with them easily.</p>
<p>The only thing Zhou Wen was worried about was that the last time he pulled out the stone saber, it triggered an anomaly in Guide City, causing more high-level dimensional creatures to appear.</p>
<p>If such a situation happened in the Maze of Lies, it would be troublesome. He wondered if the Ultimate Family Clan could handle it.</p>
<p>These weren’t problems that Zhou Wen needed to consider. The Ultimate Family Clan didn’t plan on immediately attempting the Maze of Lies, so they first got Lance to take Zhou Wen to the Maze of Lies to familiarize him with it. They themselves needed some time to make preparations.</p>
<p>Of course, Lance didn’t take Zhou Wen to the Maze of Lies on Sunday. However, it was too long to wait for Monday, so there was no need for that. Therefore, he chose to start on Thursday.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen returned, he planned on understanding the Maze of Lies in-game before realizing that after he entered the game, it was still the Maze of Lies on Monday. There was only the Mischief Clown inside.</p>
<p>What’s going on? It’s clearly Wednesday today, right? Zhou Wen suddenly thought of a possibility.</p>
<p>He arrived in front of Maze of Lies and took another picture of the tiny palm symbol. In the end, the loading screen appeared again. Soon after the download was completed, two options—Monday and Wednesday—appeared when launching the Maze of Lies in-game.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, this actually has multiple dungeons! Zhou Wen entered Wednesday’s Maze of Lies dungeon and indeed, he realized that Mischief Clowns weren’t the only ones. There were also Witches and Sorcerers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the buildings in the Maze of Lies looked even more sinister and terrifying. The merry-go-round at the entrance had turned into one with skeleton horses with blood flowing from their eyes.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen waited until Thursday before heading to Maze of Lies with Lance and company to download Thursday’s dungeon.</p>
<p>Standing in front of the maze, Lance said to Zhou Wen and company, “After entering the maze, make sure you do not speak. If you accidentally speak the truth, you will definitely die. Therefore, the best way is to not to say anything. Our family has a special silencer that can temporarily seal our ability to talk. This is the safest way. Also, to enter the Maze of Lies, there’s a very terrifying obstacle. You have to answer the question on the door before you can enter. Furthermore, the answer has to be a lie or you will be killed. This is because the questions are random and there are trap questions. Furthermore, the answers aren’t fixed for everyone. Many people died here. If you want to enter, you have to take a huge risk. If there’s no need, it’s best not to enter.”</p>
<p>Lance’s words were mainly directed at Feng Qiuyan and Li Xuan. Even if they were powerful, they might die at the door if they answered wrongly.</p>
<p>“It’s best I don’t enter such a strange place. I’ll stay here to take care of Ya’er.” Unexpectedly, Li Xuan chose not to enter.</p>
<p>In fact, Li Xuan wasn’t as carefree as he usually appeared. He didn’t mind because it was built on the premise that he wasn’t in any danger. Li Xuan wasn’t willing to take the risk for no reason in a place that might prevent him from recovering.</p>
<p>However, Feng Qiuyan said, “Since I’m here, I want to enter to take a look.”</p>
<p>Sadie and Gulli didn’t plan on entering either. In the end, other than Zhou Wen, Feng Qiuyan, and Lance, there was only a silencer from the Ultimate Family Clan.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, go in first. With us around, we can give you some suggestions to prevent any problems. If you really aren’t confident, you can choose not to answer and quit. That’s the safest way,” Lance said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen was somewhat uneasy. He had already secretly downloaded Thursday’s dungeon, so it wasn’t difficult to enter.</p>
<p>However, there would always be some baffling problems from the Maze of Lies. If he wasn’t confident, he could only use Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder to gain entry.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood in front of the door. A line of text immediately appeared on the ancient door that resembled a clown’s front teeth.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at the line of text, wanting to know what the problem was. However, the moment they saw the question, their expressions turned odd.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1009'>Chapter 1009: Sunday Dungeon</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Choose between one: a friend or a top Mythical Companion Egg. The other will be destroyed. What will your choice be?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback when he saw this question.</p>
<p>The definition of friends had a very wide range. Even very good friends would sometimes choose to sacrifice their friends when faced with enough benefits. Human nature often failed to withstand tests.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, step back. It’s very difficult to have the correct answer to this question,” Lance immediately said.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen was a little tempted by a top Mythical Companion Egg, his choice of friend would result in his death. Also, choosing a top Mythical Companion Egg would make others think that Zhou Wen didn’t value friends.</p>
<p>Of course, the choice was the other way around, but this didn’t hinder one’s comprehension.</p>
<p>“That’s right. There are many types of friends. How can we generalize them? This question is a huge trap. Don’t answer it. Let’s try again tomorrow,” Gulli said.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. There’s no need to wait for tomorrow. It’s a waste of time.” Zhou Wen secretly activated the Heaven-Opening Scripture and chose top Mythical Companion Egg. Under normal logic, it meant Zhou Wen had chosen ‘friend.’</p>
<p>Lance and company didn’t know that Zhou Wen had the ability to restrain all sorts of taboo powers. When they saw that Zhou Wen had chosen ‘friend,’ they broke out into a cold sweat for him. He might die if there was any screw up.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen walked into the Maze of Lies unscathed and didn’t die.</p>
<p>The silencer on the side said in surprise, “He’s actually willing to give up a top Mythical Companion Egg without any hesitation. Such a person is already rare.”</p>
<p>“With Coach’s strength, a top Mythical Companion Egg is nothing to him. It’s normal for him to choose a friend,” Gulli said.</p>
<p>However, Feng Qiuyan said, “Even if Coach didn’t have a Mythical Companion Egg to choose from, I believe he would choose a friend.”</p>
<p>“Regardless, I believe Zhou Wen is a rare friend,” Lance said.</p>
<p>Li Xuan knew Zhou Wen well, but he didn’t say a word.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen actually wasn’t sure how he would choose. After all, it depended on the situation. He didn’t dare confirm that he would choose a friend, so for safety’s sake, he used the Heaven-Opening Scripture.</p>
<p>Next, it was Feng Qiuyan’s turn. Feng Qiuyan’s question wasn’t difficult, so he easily gained entry.</p>
<p>The silencer and Lance joined in. Their questions didn’t have huge traps. All they needed to do was answer accordingly by lying.</p>
<p>After entering the maze, the silencer cast a silencing spell on Zhou Wen and company, preventing them from speaking as a way to stop them from saying anything wrong.</p>
<p>As it was only Thursday, although there were many types of dimensional creatures inside, they didn’t discover any Mythical creatures. The few of them didn’t take long to clean up the maze.</p>
<p>With Lance and the silencer who were familiar with the area, it wasn’t a problem.</p>
<p>After leaving the maze, Lance said to Zhou Wen, “We can continue coming here to familiarize ourselves with the situation on Friday and Saturday. However, don’t enter on Sunday for the time being. All of us will enter when we’re ready.”</p>
<p>“I’ll just take a look myself. There’s no need for you to specially accompany me. You can busy yourself with your matters.” Zhou Wen actually didn’t wish to enter in reality. He only wanted to quickly download the Sunday dungeon and enter the Sunday dungeon in-game to figure out the situation inside.</p>
<p>Lance naturally trusted Zhou Wen’s strength, so he didn’t insist on accompanying him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen went there on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday alone, but he only looked at the question on the door before returning without answering.</p>
<p>When others asked, he only said that he wasn’t confident about the question on the door, so he didn’t enter.</p>
<p>He finally downloaded the Sunday dungeon. After returning, Zhou Wen couldn’t wait to launch it. He wanted to see what was different about the Sunday dungeon.</p>
<p>After launching the game dungeon, the blood-colored avatar stood in front of the door and he found it a little different from before. The door to the maze that looked like a clown’s face had already turned into skull-like material. The skeleton clown’s face was still emitting black smoke as blood flowed from its eyes. It looked extremely ferocious and terrifying.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen directly used the Heaven-Opening Scripture to avoid the question on the door, saving him the trouble of wasting time.</p>
<p>When the door opened, the scene Zhou Wen saw was indeed different from the Maze of Lies he had previously seen.</p>
<p>Although the layout didn’t seem to have changed much, strange blood flames burned in the maze. The merry-go-round had turned into bones with blood flames burning on them.</p>
<p>Everywhere he looked was filled with bones and blood flames. It was like hell.</p>
<p>A Mischief Clown appeared on one of the horses. Its face looked even more sinister. Furthermore, its originally colorful body had turned black and white. Such purity made it look even stranger.</p>
<p>The three-colored balls also turned black and white. Each ball was half black and half white, completely different from what Zhou Wen had seen before.</p>
<p>When Mischief Clown saw the blood-colored avatar, it immediately flashed and vanished from the horse.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth to block him. As he didn’t know anything about this completely different looking Mischief Clown, Zhou Wen could only choose to first understand its abilities.</p>
<p>The vanished Mischief Clown appeared in front of Tyrant Behemoth like a ghost. It threw the magic ball in its hand at Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth’s reaction was extremely fast as it struck the black-and-white magic ball.</p>
<p>However, the black-and-white magic ball vanished in front of Tyrant Behemoth’s fist. Zhou Wen immediately felt that something was amiss as he hurriedly controlled the blood-colored avatar to teleport away.</p>
<p>Indeed, the black-and-white magic ball seemed to pass through Tyrant Behemoth and appeared behind it before flying into the distance.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen hadn’t dodged, the black-and-white magic ball would have hit him.</p>
<p>What ability is that? It’s completely different from ordinary Mischief Clowns. Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>However, the Mischief Clown didn’t give him any time to be surprised. He threw out one black-and-white magic ball after another.</p>
<p>Unlike ordinary Mischief Clowns, it didn’t only have three black-and-white magic balls, but a total of six. Every black-and-white magic ball looked identical.</p>
<p>Even if the magic ball that it threw didn’t hit its target, it would bounce back after hitting something. The black-and-white magic ball that bounced back would become even faster.</p>
<p>The six magic balls quickly shot out from nearby. Every time Tyrant Behemoth wanted to strike the magic balls, the magic balls would vanish and appear in another spot.</p>
<p>The magic balls only targeted the blood-colored avatar. From the looks of it, not only did Sunday’s Mischief Clown’s abilities become terrifying, but even his intelligence seemed to have increased greatly. He actually knew the principle of capturing the leader.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1010'>Chapter 1010: Divination House of Fate</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that if he continued dodging, the magic ball would bounce faster and faster. Sooner or later, it would hit him, so he stopped dodging. He pulled out the Bronze Sparrow Sword and slashed at one of the magic balls that was bouncing towards the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already prepared for the magic ball to suddenly vanish, but it didn’t vanish. It was struck by the Bronze Sparrow Sword.</p>
<p>It was different from what he had imagined. The magic ball didn’t seem to be very hard, nor did it have any explosive effects. It didn’t have ice or fire, nor did it have the effects of the yellow ball.</p>
<p>Just like that, the black-and-white magic ball was cleaved into two by Zhou Wen before shattering into powder.</p>
<p>In the next second, the devil-like clown appeared to his left. His sharp black fingernails stabbed at the blood-colored avatar’s neck.</p>
<p>The clown’s speed was very fast; it was definitely at the Mythical stage. However, Zhou Wen’s reaction and speed weren’t slow either. He extended his hand to block the clown’s strike.</p>
<p>He originally wanted to use his left hand to block, but he immediately realized that something was amiss. This was because he was thinking of his left hand, but his right hand ended up moving. Furthermore, when he wanted to block with his left hand, his right hand raised to the right. It was completely opposite from what he had imagined.</p>
<p>In an instant, Zhou Wen reacted and understood what had happened.</p>
<p>Seeing that the clown’s dagger-like fingernails had already touched the skin on the blood-colored avatar’s neck and were about to stab into it, Zhou Wen’s body spun like a top as he barely dodged the strike.</p>
<p>That magic ball actually has the ability to distort thoughts and physical actions. When I think left, I move right. When I think up, it moves down. If it were anyone else, they wouldn’t have reacted in time. The more they try to dodge, the more they would slam into danger. Zhou Wen was extremely calm. After figuring out the reason, he controlled his body to circle around the clown.</p>
<p>It was very difficult for ordinary people to not make mistakes after their thoughts and actions were reversed, but Zhou Wen’s mind was extremely clear. He didn’t make any mistakes as he dodged the clown’s repeated attacks.</p>
<p>After the blood-colored avatar was hit by the magic ball, the other magic balls didn’t attack him. One of them hit Tyrant Behemoth, and then Tyrant Behemoth revealed a situation where its thoughts and actions were completely opposite.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth clearly didn’t have Zhou Wen’s powerful thought processes. It immediately became at a loss for what to do. It wanted to rush left, but it ended up charging right. Instead of retreating, it advanced. It nearly tripped on its left leg and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Sunday’s Mischief Clown is so powerful… Just its ability is so strange. I wonder how many Mischief Clowns there are here. If there are as many as usual, it would be very terrifying without even including the other dimensional creatures, Zhou Wen thought as he fought.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen discovered the secret of the Mischief Clown’s magic ball. It turned out that the magic ball couldn’t penetrate walls. Instead, during its flight, it caused a spinning vortex to appear around the ball due to its high-speed rotation. Once the vortex stopped, the magic ball would automatically deviate from its trajectory and dodge the fist. It would slide down or sideways, making it look like it had vanished.</p>
<p>In fact, Mischief Clown didn’t have spatial abilities. It was just that the technique of throwing the magic ball was very powerful.</p>
<p>The dimensional creatures here are really interesting. I wonder if a Companion Egg will drop? Zhou Wen was extremely interested in the Sunday clown’s ability. Be it the method of throwing the magic ball or the ability to subvert one’s thoughts with the magic ball, they were very useful. Furthermore, the clown had the ability to move stealthily.</p>
<p>If it were anyone else, they would be doomed if they couldn’t control their bodies when their Companion Beasts couldn’t be used normally. However, these abilities weren’t of much use against Zhou Wen. Soon, he saw an opportunity. When the clown appeared again, he used Light Concealment Sword to kill it.</p>
<p>‘Killed Mythical creature, Devil Clown.’</p>
<p>Nothing dropped. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be somewhat disappointed. So this isn’t Mischief Clown anymore. It’s a true Mythical creature. From the looks of it, I’ll have to farm this place a few more times in the future. Even if I can’t obtain a Companion Egg, I can still obtain skill crystals.</p>
<p>After finishing off the Devil Clown, Zhou Wen continued walking forward. However, before long, the blood-colored avatar suddenly died and the game screen went black.</p>
<p>How did I die? Zhou Wen carefully recalled, but he still didn’t know how he died.</p>
<p>He had no choice but to drip his blood to revive again and enter Maze of Lies. This time, Zhou Wen didn’t see the Demon Clown on the merry-go-round, so he walked straight ahead.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that there would be quite a number of Devil Clowns here, but he only saw one. He didn’t find a second one.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen walked into an ancient castle, he discovered another dimensional creature. This time, it was a Divination Witch.</p>
<p>The Divination Witch started appearing in the dungeon on Wednesday. She was also an Epic dimensional creature. She was a terrifying-looking old woman in blue clothes and a blue hat. She even held a crystal ball in her hand.</p>
<p>Her abilities didn’t seem to be anything impressive. She could only use the crystal ball to activate some light-attribute waves.</p>
<p>However, the Divination Witch in front of him was completely different. No, it wasn’t one, but two.</p>
<p>Two witches sat side by side behind the long table in the ancient castle. One was dressed in white and had a white hat, while the other was dressed in black and had a black hat. Both of them were maidens. They were completely different from the old and ugly witches in the previous few days. They were rather fair and beautiful.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they didn’t have a crystal ball in their hands. The white-robed witch held a black poker card in her hand, while the black-robed witch held a white poker card in her hand.</p>
<p>The two witches sat there and silently watched Zhou Wen walk into the hall. They had no intention of attacking.</p>
<p>“Welcome to the Divination House of Fate. You can draw a card from our hands to decide your fate.” The white-robed witch and the black-robed witch spoke at the same time. Their voices were completely identical. If one closed their eyes, they would think that only one person was speaking.</p>
<p>“Why should I draw your cards?” Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in playing divination games with them. He drew his sword and slashed at the white-robed witch.</p>
<p>The white-robed witch was surprisingly weak. He was already prepared for a fierce battle, but the white-robed witch had fallen to the sword and had her head beheaded by the Bronze Sparrow Sword.</p>
<p>However, at the instant the white-robed witch’s head was chopped off, Zhou Wen realized that the blood-colored avatar’s head had also fallen. The way it fell was identical to the white-robed witch’s head. It was as though it had been chopped off by someone.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>The game screen went black as Zhou Wen faced death again.</p>
<p>This dungeon is really sick. What the hell is it? Zhou Wen hadn’t died like this in a long time. The Maze of Lies was somewhat different in every aspect.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this was in-game. It wasn’t a big deal to die once. If it was in reality, Zhou Wen definitely wouldn’t take the risk in such a dangerous place.</p>
<p>I wonder how much Frod and company know about the Maze of Lies on Sunday? Zhou Wen felt that helping Frod this time wouldn’t go so smoothly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1011'>Chapter 1011: Destiny’s Draw</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>On the cube’s rankings, Guardians had already begun challenging each other to obtain a higher ranking.</p>
<p>People believed that Guardians should aim for first place. Rankings other than first didn’t seem to be of much use. They should challenge Ya, who was first.</p>
<p>However, in fact, no one challenged Ya. The challenged Guardians were basically ranked above fifth place.</p>
<p>This also allowed people to finally see how powerful Guardians were. Humans with Guardians were equivalent to Mythical creatures. They could have all sorts of Companion Beasts and Mythical skills. They were far stronger than a single Mythical Companion Beast.</p>
<p>The battle between Guardians was far more complicated and interesting than the battle between Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Once a Companion Beast was defeated, there was no hope of a comeback. However, the battle between Guardians was ever-changing. Any factor could change the outcome of the battle.</p>
<p>Apart from Lie, who had mysteriously vanished from the rankings, there were more and more challenges for the Guardians ranked beyond fifth place. Many new Guardians also joined the rankings.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>However, it was obvious that they didn’t know each other well. They were also testing the other party’s abilities. They didn’t really fight to the death, and it was very likely that they were hiding many abilities.</p>
<p>Even so, it was still extremely satisfying to watch. Now, just the battle of Companion Beasts was no longer able to attract attention.</p>
<p>All over the world, people were discussing the problem of Guardians. There were also people secretly searching for Guardian cocoons, hoping to contract one and gain success in one step.</p>
<p>Guardians were just too attractive to ordinary people. As long as one was lucky and obtained the Guardian’s recognition, they could ascend to the Mythical stage in a single step. This was more attractive than any treasure.</p>
<p>It was obvious that many new Guardians were on the rankings.</p>
<p>However, the trouble that followed seemed to have just begun. In several places in the Federation, there were incidents of Guardians committing crimes.</p>
<p>Guardians owned by unknown humans had a terrifying propensity to commit crime.</p>
<p>Although the Federation had already tried its best to maintain the situation, its control over the various lands was weakening day by day. Unless the Guardians were suicidal and went to the territories controlled by the six families, the chances of capturing them were slim.</p>
<p>“The appearance of Guardians is really not a good thing for the Federation,” Sadie, who was watching the news, said with a frown.</p>
<p>“The Guardians these days aren’t actually that terrifying. After all, those who have obtained Guardians didn’t have a good foundation in the past. It’s not difficult to deal with them even after they obtain a Guardian. However, with the passage of time, these fellows will truly create chaos when they have all sorts of Mythical Companion Eggs,” said Lance.</p>
<p>“Isn’t the ultimate battle happening in a month?” Sadie said.</p>
<p>“In a month, it will only determine the ownership of the Dimensional Wheel, but the battle between Guardians has only just begun. To truly resolve the problem of Guardians, relying on the King of Earth is useless. They are jackals of the same tribe,” said Lance.</p>
<p>“Is there still a way out?” Sadie said after some thought.</p>
<p>“Yes. Just kill all the Guardians like Zhou Wen,” said Lance.</p>
<p>“How many freaks like Zhou Wen can you find in the Federation?” Sadie smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>“Fight fire with fire,” Lance said slowly.</p>
<p>Sadie immediately understood what Lance meant. Since Guardians were difficult to eliminate, they could only contract Guardians themselves and use Guardians to kill Guardians.</p>
<p>“I’m just afraid that it will leave latent problems for the future,” Sadie said.</p>
<p>“It’s better than nothing.” Lance paused before saying, “After I get the mask from the Maze of Lies, I’ll think of a way to contract a Guardian.”</p>
<p>Sadie wanted to say something, but she opened her mouth and ultimately didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>In this era, the path ahead was filled with fog. No one knew which path was correct. Only by taking one would one know.</p>
<p>However, no one knew if the person who walked out would return alive.</p>
<p>“How’s Zhou Wen?” Lance asked again.</p>
<p>“He went a few times, but he rarely entered the Maze of Lies. He hasn’t entered the dimensional zone since Friday,” Sadie answered.</p>
<p>“That’s normal. When the people invited by the family arrive, we can enter the maze together,” Lance said with a slight nod.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen once again entered Sunday’s Maze of Lies. The Devil Clown didn’t seem to have respawned. Zhou Wen once again arrived at the Divination House and saw the twin-like witches.</p>
<p>Just like the last time, they extended the cards in their hands and got Zhou Wen to draw them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and decided to try it out. He wanted to see what tricks they had up their sleeves. It wouldn’t be too late to deal with them after he figured it out.</p>
<p>“How many do I have to draw?” Zhou Wen asked the twin witches.</p>
<p>“One,” the two witches answered in unison.</p>
<p>“One card per deck?” Zhou Wen looked at the two different black and white poker cards and asked.</p>
<p>“Just one,” the witches answered again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and got the blood-colored avatar to draw one from the black-robed witch’s white poker cards.</p>
<p>This should be something like a tarot card, right? Zhou Wen thought as he flipped the card over. However, the card he saw had nothing to do with tarot cards.</p>
<p>On the white card was a black symbol. It was a black silhouette. Although it was only a silhouette and its appearance couldn’t be seen, one could naturally associate it with a western mythical figure that had a large and long sickle.</p>
<p>“Is this Death?” Zhou Wen asked the witch in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Yes,” the black-robed witch answered with a nod.</p>
<p>“What does drawing this card mean?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“It means that Death will take your life,” the black-robed witch answered.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, he suddenly realized that a black shadow, Death, similar to the card had appeared behind the blood-colored avatar. Without waiting for the blood-colored avatar to react, Death slashed down and killed it.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar’s armor didn’t work. It was as though Death had reaped its soul and not its body.</p>
<p>Looking at the black screen, Zhou Wen had no choice but to drip his blood to revive. This time, Zhou Wen drew one from the white-robed witch’s black poker cards.</p>
<p>A black Death can be drawn on a white poker card. I don’t think I can draw that on a black poker card, right? Zhou Wen thought as he drew a black card.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was overjoyed when he flipped the card over. There was a white shadow on the black card. Even if he couldn’t see its appearance, the wings and the halo above his head undoubtedly meant that it was an angel card.</p>
<p>“This should be an angel, right? What does he represent? Did I win?” Zhou Wen asked the white-robed witch.</p>
<p>“No, this means that he will take you to Heaven,” the white-robed witch said calmly.</p>
<p>In the next second, Zhou Wen saw the angel’s shadow appear behind the blood-colored avatar. Then, a white light flew out from the blood-colored avatar’s head and it collapsed to the ground. The game screen went black again.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1012'>Chapter 1012: One in 54</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Choosing black is death, but so is choosing white. I can’t kill the witches either. How can I survive? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Of course, he could just make no choice. With Truth Listener’s Evil Nullification and Heaven-Opening Scripture, he might be able to forcefully break through and kill the black-and-white Destiny Witches.</p>
<p>However, if Zhou Wen were to enter the Maze of Lies with Lance and company in the future, it was best to understand the various abilities of the black-and-white Destiny Witches. If anything happened, he could figure out how to deal with it.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen’s main goal for grinding wasn’t to clear the dungeon, but to figure out all the information regarding Sunday’s dungeon to prevent any accidents from happening in real life.</p>
<p>After entering the game again, Zhou Wen went in front of the witches. This time, Zhou Wen wanted to see if he could draw a few more cards, but it was useless. After he drew the first white poker card, the other cards would vanish into thin air when he attempted touching them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen flipped the cards over and saw that there was still a black silhouette on the white poker card. However, this time, it wasn’t Death, but a black heart. Furthermore, the middle of the heart had cracked.</p>
<p>After seeing it, Zhou Wen felt the heart in his chest rupture before the game screen went black.</p>
<p>“Do you have any cards that allow for survival?” Zhou Wen asked the two witches when he came in front of them again.</p>
<p>“Yes,” the two witches answered in unison.</p>
<p>“How many cards are there in total? How many allow for survival?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“There are 54 cards in each deck. There are 108 cards in total,” the black-robed witch said.</p>
<p>“Every deck has a card that allows survival. Your chances are still very high,” the white-robed witch said immediately.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s face immediately darkened. In other words, I only have a one in fifty-four chance of drawing a card for survival?</p>
<p>“In theory, but you can try a few more times. The success rate will naturally be higher,” the two witches said together.</p>
<p>“Try my ass. If it was in real life, I would have died a long time ago. How would I have the chance to try again?” Zhou Wen felt that there was definitely some trick to drawing the cards. Otherwise, it would be too difficult to get what he needed with luck.</p>
<p>Luck… Wait… Could it be that to kill the Destiny Witches, one needs someone with a Luck-type skill, like Wang Lu? Zhou Wen thought of Wang Lu, whose luck was virtually invincible. If she were to draw, she would definitely be able to draw the card that meant survival.</p>
<p>If I need luck, I definitely won’t be able to draw it. Zhou Wen tried using Truth Listener’s ability to listen to the cards and used Doctor Darkness’s Light of Penetration, but it was useless.</p>
<p>The cards he saw and heard were blank. He had no idea what the cards were showing.</p>
<p>He thought of all sorts of ways to cheat, but all of them were useless. If he wanted to clear this obstacle, he had to invite Wang Lu over. Otherwise, he could only use force.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen summoned Truth Listener and activated the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder before drawing his card.</p>
<p>However, the first card was an angel. Zhou Wen immediately felt the Truth Listener earring heat up before large amounts of Essence Energy surged into his body.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Although the angel shadow appeared, it failed to take the blood-colored avatar’s soul into Heaven.</p>
<p>Seeing that Truth Listener’s Evil Nullification was effective, Zhou Wen continued drawing cards. He drew them one by one. The Truth Listener earring kept heating up as Essence Energy surged into him like waves.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that if it wasn’t for Truth Listener’s ability, he would have died countless times.</p>
<p>When he drew the 37th card, Zhou Wen pulled out a black mask from the white card. This time, the Truth Listener earring didn’t heat up, nor did it produce Essence Energy.</p>
<p>At the same time, the wall behind the black-and-white Destiny Witches parted. It was the door that led to the back of the Maze of Lies.</p>
<p>In the previous Monday to Saturday instance dungeons, Witch Castle was the end. There was no such door, so Zhou Wen didn’t know what was behind the door.</p>
<p>The black-and-white witches looked at Zhou Wen from the side without any intention of attacking. From the looks of it, they were rather special dimensional creatures and had no intention of fighting him to the death.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to walk out the door and leave Destiny Witch Castle.</p>
<p>After walking past the door, Zhou Wen immediately saw a garden. In the middle of the garden was a strange tree.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that the tree looked somewhat similar to the Dead Man Tree and the Longevity Tree, but there were some differences.</p>
<p>At the very least, there were no fruits on the tree. Beneath it, an elder sat with his back against the tree. His clothes were tattered, and from the holes, one could see his skin and bones. However, his chest was still heaving slightly. He didn’t look dead.</p>
<p>As though he heard the blood-colored avatar’s footsteps, the elder opened his eyes. His eyes were deep and looked extremely turbid.</p>
<p>“Young man, it’s great to finally meet you. I don’t have to die with that huge secret…” the elder said weakly.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen drew his sword and slashed.</p>
<p>Who was he kidding? This was a game, not reality. It was impossible for a human to exist in-game. No matter how much the elder looked like a human, Zhou Wen was certain that he wasn’t human.</p>
<p>Just as the Bronze Sparrow Sword was about to strike, the zombie-like elder suddenly released a terrifying force. He leaped up and charged into the sky at an unbelievable speed, dodging Zhou Wen’s strike.</p>
<p>As for the elder, his body had already changed in midair. He transformed into Zhou Wen and charged at him. His movement technique was extremely strange.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered to fight him. He summoned his Mythical lineup and surrounded it.</p>
<p>In the next second, the monster that had transformed into Zhou Wen emitted a white fog before transforming into the Great Might Vajra Bull. When the two bulls stood together, it was impossible to tell which was real and which was fake.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Great Might Vajra Bull was Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast. It was telepathically connected to Zhou Wen, so he could naturally tell which was real or fake.</p>
<p>No matter how the dimensional creature changed, it was still quickly beaten to death.</p>
<p>‘Killed Mythical creature, Shapeshifting Beast. Discovered Dimensional Crystal.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at the crystal and was immediately disappointed when he realized that it was only an ordinary stat crystal.</p>
<p>Although there are many Mythical creatures in the Maze of Lies on Sunday, the drop rate isn’t very high. Zhou Wen thought carefully and realized that he had only killed two Mythical creatures. One was a Devil Clown and the other was a Shapeshifting Beast. It couldn’t be considered a lot.</p>
<p>There was only one Shapeshifting Beast in the entire garden. There were no other dimensional creatures, nor was there any other way out. Zhou Wen glanced at the tree and had no choice but to return via the same path. He then returned, through Witch Castle, to the maze that resembled an amusement park and continued exploring.</p>

<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>In order to clear the Maze of Lies and obtain the mask inside, other than the experts from the Ultimate Family Clan, they also invited experts with Mythical Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>However, very few of these people were members of the six families. They were basically the leaders of the various wealthy families in the North District. In the East District, they were equivalent to An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>It could be seen that the Ultimate Family Clan was very prestigious in the North District. Furthermore, the wealthy families in the North District were united. They weren’t like the East and West District, where there was a lot of internal strife.</p>
<p>Although Frod was one of the six heroes, he was trapped in the ice cave and couldn’t move freely. Now, the true leader of the Ultimate Family Clan was Gaiman.</p>
<p>After all the invited experts arrived, Gaiman planned on holding a meeting to explain the general situation and introduce Zhou Wen to them.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen had already said that he had to have the final say, Gaiman was the leader in this operation, but he still needed to listen to Zhou Wen on how to proceed.</p>
<p>“Inform Zhou Wen about the meeting tomorrow,” Gaiman said to his secretary.</p>
<p>The secretary responded but didn’t leave immediately.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Gaiman looked at Gemar and asked.</p>
<p>“According to our observations over the past few days, Zhou Wen has only entered Friday’s Maze of Lies at most. He hasn’t entered the Maze of Lies on Sunday at all. Is it really good to give him veto powers? This concerns the fate of our Ultimate Family Clan,” Gemar said.</p>
<p>“Old Master naturally has his reasons for making such a decision. Furthermore, Zhou Wen is indeed a person with true talent. You saw the battle between him and Lie. To be able to defeat the Guardian without any external help, how many people in the Federation can do so?” Gaiman said.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen is very strong, and it’s indisputable, but strength is different from being a commander. I’m afraid that problems will arise because of his decisions,” Gemar said.</p>
<p>“There’s no rush. We still have time to get used to each other and build teamwork. Deliver the news of the meeting.” After Gaiman said that, he lowered his head and continued working on his documents.</p>
<p>Gemar had no choice but to leave the office and arrange for someone to inform Zhou Wen of the meeting tomorrow.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen received the notice of the meeting, he agreed readily. He already had a more detailed understanding of the Sunday dungeon, but he hadn’t found the mask that Frod had mentioned.</p>
<p>The Ultimate Family Clan still had some secret information regarding the Maze of Lies that hadn’t been released. The information would likely be announced at the meeting. Zhou Wen wanted to know how much they knew about the Sunday dungeon.</p>
<p>The next morning, Zhou Wen left with Ya’er. Just as he was about to attend the meeting, he saw a girl getting out of a car.</p>
<p>“Wang Lu? Why are you here?” Zhou Wen asked Wang Lu in pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>“Old Mister Gaiman invited me to help, so I came.” Wang Lu wore a white fox fur coat, making her baby-like skin appear even whiter.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Upon hearing Wang Lu’s words, Zhou Wen knew that the Ultimate Family Clan was very knowledgeable about the Maze of Lies on Sunday. Inviting Wang Lu was most likely to deal with the Destiny Witches.</p>
<p>“This operation is very dangerous. Why did you agree to come?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>Wang Lu smiled and said, “Our family has quite a number of business dealings with the North District. Furthermore, Old Mister Gaiman has repeatedly guaranteed my safety. Furthermore, I heard that you are here and will be participating in this operation. What else do I have to worry about?”</p>
<p>“You can’t say that. It’s best to be careful. This dimensional zone is indeed very strange. You mustn’t be careless,” Zhou Wen exhorted.</p>
<p>“Sir, Madam, the family head is already waiting for you inside.” A staff member came over to welcome them.</p>
<p>The two of them chatted as they walked. Wang Lu was fine and things were very stable at her side. Although Wang Chan still had occasional incidents, with Wang Lu’s Life Providence suppressing her, nothing serious happened.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>When the two of them entered the meeting hall, many people looked over.</p>
<p>In the entire meeting hall, only the two of them weren’t from the North District. Furthermore, Zhou Wen had recently killed Joseph, who had a Guardian. This had caused quite a stir in the North District.</p>
<p>Gaiman introduced the two of them to everyone at the right time. At the same time, he said, “When attacking the Maze of Lies, there are some key areas that require the help of the two of them. They are an indispensable part of this operation. This is because after entering the Maze of Lies, there’s no way to communicate with words. Therefore, before we go, there are some things that need to be explained clearly. We also need to practice and train for a period of time to prevent any problems from happening after entering the dimensional zone.”</p>
<p>After arranging for Zhou Wen and Wang Lu to sit down, Gaiman explained the detailed plan.</p>
<p>The Ultimate Family Clan knew a lot about the situation regarding Sunday’s dungeon. They also knew the abilities of the Devil Clown and the Destiny Witches and explained in detail.</p>
<p>From Gaiman’s description, Zhou Wen knew that they had paid the price of many lives to obtain this information.</p>
<p>However, their intelligence wasn’t much more than Zhou Wen’s, nor was it that detailed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen realized that they hadn’t been able to pass the Destiny Witches’ trial to reach the garden at the back.</p>
<p>The reason they had invited Wang Lu all the way here was to deal with the Destiny Witches. Only then could they pass the witches to reach the final garden.</p>
<p>However, there was something that left Zhou Wen puzzled. Gaiman and company had clearly failed to pass the test of the Destiny Witches and reach the final garden.</p>
<p>Yet, they seemed to be very certain that the mask was behind Witch Castle. As long as they defeated the Destiny Witches, they would have a chance of obtaining the mask.</p>
<p>Strange, why didn’t I see that mask in the garden? Zhou Wen had already carefully searched the entire garden, but he didn’t discover the mask that Frod had mentioned.</p>
<p>As for the plan that Gaiman and the others had set up, it was all for the sake of passing Witch Castle. It would be fun if they couldn’t find the mask after entering the garden.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there was a Shapeshifting Beast in the garden. It was fine if Zhou Wen went in alone, and the rest of his team were Companion Beasts. Regardless of who the Shapeshifting Beast turned into, Zhou Wen could tell.</p>
<p>However, with so many people entering, it would be difficult to identify the Shapeshifting Beast if it transformed into anything outside Zhou Wen’s sphere of influence.</p>
<p>After explaining the plan, Gaiman asked Zhou Wen, “Zhou Wen, what do you think?”</p>
<p>The others also looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I have a question. Since no one has defeated the witches, it means that no one has reached the place outside the ancient castle. How do you know that there must be a mask there?” Zhou Wen asked Gaiman.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1014'>Chapter 1014: The Difference Between Reality and In-game</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“My father reached the back of Witch Castle a long time ago and saw the mask there, so the mask is behind Witch Castle. There’s no mistake about that,” Gaiman said.</p>
<p>“So Old Hero Frod has been there before. Then there’s no mistake about it,” a big shot from the North District said.</p>
<p>Everyone nodded. It looked like Frod’s reputation in the North District was unparalleled. Just the mention of his name made everyone reveal looks of awe.</p>
<p>“So the old hero has been there before. I wonder in which spot the old hero saw the mask?” Zhou Wen continued asking.</p>
<p>This was because he knew that there was only a garden behind the castle without any mask to be seen, so he had to ask clearly. Otherwise, it would be a waste of time for so many people to risk entering.</p>
<p>Gaiman smiled and said, “Behind Witch Castle is a garden. My father saw the mask there. Unfortunately, my father was alone. He was afraid that taking the mask would trigger a dimensional zone anomaly, so he didn’t take it back.”</p>
<p>“Which part in the garden?” Zhou Wen was somewhat convinced when Gaiman mentioned a garden. After all, it was impossible to know that there was a garden if one hadn’t been there before.</p>
<p>“According to my father, the mask is embedded on a grave’s tombstone in the middle of the garden,” Gaiman answered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown when he heard that as he thought to himself, That’s strange. Why do I only see a tree in the middle of the garden and not a tombstone?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out what had gone wrong. What he had seen in-game couldn’t be wrong, but if Frod hadn’t been there, he wouldn’t have known that there was a garden.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that something was amiss. After some thought, he asked, “I wonder if you can tell me the details of the situation?”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you being a little too rude? Mr. Gaiman has already made it very clear. It’s also something that Old Hero Frod saw with his own eyes. What else do you have to doubt? Do you want the old hero to crawl out of his grave and personally explain it to you before you believe him?” Someone felt that Zhou Wen was being too rude by repeatedly pressing for answers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they had said that because they didn’t know that Frod wasn’t dead.</p>
<p>Gaiman waved his hand and said, “The stakes are high, so it’s good that Zhou Wen is cautious. Zhou Wen, did you notice a problem?”</p>
<p>“No.” Zhou Wen could only shake his head. He couldn’t say that he had already been there in-game, and there were no tombstones or masks there.</p>
<p>Gaiman continued explaining the plan and even played some 3D animation. There were introductions to the skills of the Devil Clown, the Divination Witch, and other dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>However, this introduction was clearly not comprehensive enough. It only introduced some skills.</p>
<p>After the meeting ended, Gaiman stopped Zhou Wen. “Zhou Wen, if it’s convenient, follow me.”</p>
<p>“I’ll wait for you outside,” Wang Lu said when she saw Zhou Wen look over.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen followed Gaiman to his office. Gaiman looked at Zhou Wen and asked, “If you have anything to say, feel free to say it now. It’s inconvenient to communicate inside the maze. If anything happens, it will be very troublesome.”</p>
<p>“Can you let me meet the old hero again? I want to know the details of when he saw the mask,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You might not know this, but my father is trapped in the ice wall. He can’t communicate with others at any time. Most of the time, he’s just an ice sculpture. Occasionally, he will regain partial consciousness. When you saw him previously, it was already the last time he was relatively conscious. Not long after that, he turned into an ice sculpture. I don’t know how long it will take for him to regain consciousness again.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Gaiman said, “However, my father recorded down the situation in detail. If you need it, I can make a copy for you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Since he couldn’t see Frod, he had no choice but to accept.</p>
<p>Gaiman quickly handed a copy to Zhou Wen. “If you discover anything, remember to inform us immediately.”</p>
<p>“I will. I’ll head back now.” Zhou Wen flipped through the documents and realized that there were more than ten pages of content that recorded many things. He probably wouldn’t be able to finish them in a short period of time, so he planned on taking them back to slowly read them.</p>
<p>Gaiman got his secretary to see Zhou Wen out. When the secretary returned, he asked, “Do you really believe that Zhou Wen has discovered something?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if I believe it or not. One can never be too careful. This matter can’t go wrong. It’s best if he doesn’t discover anything. If he does, it will be beneficial to us,” Gaiman said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen arrived at the entrance and saw Wang Lu, Lance, and company waiting for him.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, did you discover something?” Lance was also present, but because everyone present was his elder, he had no right to speak.</p>
<p>“I keep feeling that there’s something amiss about this matter, but I can’t put my finger on it. It would be great if I could meet your great-grandfather again,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Great-grandfather’s situation is highly variable. Even if we meet him now, there’s no way to communicate,” Lance said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll think about it again. After all, there will still be a period of time for us to build our teamwork. We won’t immediately head to the Maze of Lies. We still have time.” Zhou Wen flipped through the document.</p>
<p>According to the records, it had happened not long after the Maze of Lies had been discovered. Back then, Frod didn’t know that the state of the maze differed daily. The first time he had entered was on Monday, but he didn’t go in again during the next few days. It was Sunday when he wanted to go to the maze again, so the outcome was obvious.</p>
<p>Thankfully, when Frod saw that the situation wasn’t right, he released his Companion Beast to resist the Devil Clown. He wanted to escape the maze at full speed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was no such chance. Frod was struck by the black-and-white magic ball and he lost control of his body. The Devil Clown that phased into existence used its dagger-like nails to slice open the aorta on his neck. Soon, he fainted.</p>
<p>Frod originally thought that he was doomed, but to his surprise, he woke up not long after. He was in a narrow and confined space.</p>
<p>Frod pushed the lid for a long time before he crawled out and realized that he was lying in a grave.</p>
<p>On the tombstone in front of the grave, he discovered the mask.</p>
<p>And the spot where the grave was was the garden Zhou Wen had seen in-game.</p>
<p>When Frod escaped from the garden, he saw the twin Destiny Witches and the ancient castle. Only then did he know that the garden was behind the witch’s castle.</p>
<p>Strange, how did he enter the garden? Who took him in? Is there really a grave and tombstone in the garden in reality? Zhou Wen was still puzzled when he read the information.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1015'>Chapter 1015: Mysterious Method of Death</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>After returning to his residence, Zhou Wen switched on his phone and entered the Maze of Lies on Sunday. He also passed the test of the Destiny Witches and arrived at the garden again.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen searched very carefully. There was definitely no grave in the garden, much less the tombstone and mask that Frod had described.</p>
<p>There was only one tree in the middle of the garden. It stood in the middle of the garden like a huge umbrella.</p>
<p>There really aren’t any graves or masks in-game. I can only go to reality to see if there are any. Zhou Wen glanced at the tree and was somewhat unwilling to return. He summoned the Bronze Sparrow Sword and slashed at the tree.</p>
<p>He wanted to dig up the tree and take a look. Perhaps there was a grave under the tree.</p>
<p>The Bronze Sparrow Sword slashed at the tree’s roots with terrifying flames. It only managed to slice less than three centimeters into the tree before it stopped. The flames failed to burn the tree.</p>
<p>To be more precise, the tree trunk and leaves became even more vibrant and lively in the flames.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the Bronze Sparrow Sword back and saw magma-like liquid flowing out of the tree’s wound. Furthermore, after the liquid flowed out, it quickly cooled down and turned to dust. The damage to the tree quickly healed.</p>
<p>This is a plant-type Mythical creature? As Zhou Wen was thinking, he suddenly saw the blood-colored avatar collapse to the ground. The game screen went black.</p>
<p>How did I die? Zhou Wen felt that he needed to figure out the true situation in the garden. He had a nagging feeling that the operation wouldn’t go so smoothly.</p>
<p>After entering the garden again, Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth, hoping to see if he could uproot the tree.</p>
<p>In the Absolute Strength state, Tyrant Behemoth could be considered a peak force at the Mythical stage. After it gigantified, it crouched down and held the tree trunk with both hands before pulling it upwards.</p>
<p>Tree roots tore out of the ground as the entire garden trembled. However, the tree wasn’t pulled out.</p>
<p>Seeing that Tyrant Behemoth couldn’t do it alone, he summoned Torch Dragon, Black Dragon, Vajra Bull, and other Companion Beasts to pull out the tree.</p>
<p>Under the pull of the Mythical Companion Beasts, the tree’s roots snapped one by one as magma-like liquid flowed out. Then, it turned into ashes and vanished, but it still failed to be pulled out.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the blood-colored avatar collapsed to the ground again as the game screen went black.</p>
<p>Could it be that the liquid flowing out of the tree has some special power that kills me? In order to prove this hypothesis, Zhou Wen didn’t do anything after entering the garden again. He got the blood-colored avatar to stand in the garden and wait.</p>
<p>This was also to verify another guess because Zhou Wen realized that the time of the blood-colored avatar’s inexplicable deaths seemed to be very similar.</p>
<p>Time ticked by. When the blood-colored avatar had been in the garden for an hour, it died without any warning. The game screen went black again.</p>
<p>This time was rather similar to the time of death last time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carried out many experiments again. He wanted to figure out what was going on.</p>
<p>The situation was more complicated than Zhou Wen imagined. The few experiments produced different results.</p>
<p>Gaiman sent someone to invite Zhou Wen to participate in the training, but he declined the invitation.</p>
<p>Earlier on, Zhou Wen still had the intention to cooperate, but now, he knew very well that he had to figure out why the blood-colored avatar had died as soon as possible. Otherwise, it was very likely that no one would survive this operation.</p>
<p>Gaiman didn’t say anything when Zhou Wen didn’t participate on the first day. However, Zhou Wen didn’t attend on the second and third day. Ignoring Gaiman, even the rich and powerful personnel that came had negative views of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What’s this? Does he think he’s impressive just because he has some strength? Does he think it’s beneath him to be associated with us?” The people from the North District had a bad temper to begin with. Zhou Wen’s actions naturally displeased them.</p>
<p>“He’s Wang Mingyuan’s disciple. He has a backer. Even if dimensional creatures occupy Earth, he can still live very well. Can you do it? If not, shut up,” another local tycoon quipped.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t come for training, but he has the final say. What if he gives random orders? Do you want us to listen to him and send you to your death? Mr. Gaiman, do you think that’s appropriate?” someone questioned Gaiman.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen might have some matters to resolve. After the matter is resolved, he will probably come. Everyone, calm down.” As Gaiman comforted everyone, he secretly got Lance, Sadie, and company to figure out what Zhou Wen was doing.</p>
<p>Although Lance and Sadie felt that Zhou Wen wasn’t an arrogant person, they were very puzzled over his non-participation in the training. Therefore, they went to Zhou Wen’s residence.</p>
<p>Before they arrived at his place, they met Wang Lu, who was hugging Ya’er and carrying bags of snacks.</p>
<p>Wang Lu didn’t participate in the training either. However, she was only responsible for drawing cards from the Destiny Witches alone, so she didn’t need to have good teamwork with the others. Furthermore, she didn’t have the authority to make decisions, so no one had asked her to participate in the training.</p>
<p>“Wang Lu, why did you buy so many snacks? Didn’t I get someone to arrange a chef for you? Is the food not to your liking?” Sadie asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“No, the food is very good, but Zhou Wen is in his room… cultivating… He doesn’t want to go out, so he got me to buy some food and drinks for him,” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>“I see. What cultivation is Coach doing?” Sadie asked.</p>
<p>“This… I’m not too sure either…” Wang Lu’s expression changed slightly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was basically gaming in his room. He didn’t cultivate at all. She only felt that it wasn’t appropriate to say that Zhou Wen was gaming, so she swapped it to cultivation.</p>
<p>“We naturally trust Zhou Wen’s character, but the others have many doubts. Furthermore, it’s better for him to familiarize himself with the other’s abilities. It’s beneficial for combat. I still hope he can participate in training,” said Lance.</p>
<p>As they spoke, they went to Zhou Wen’s room.</p>
<p>When she arrived at the door, Wang Lu knocked and said, “Zhou Wen, open the door. I’m back from buying your stuff. Lance and the rest are here to see you.”</p>
<p>Wang Lu naturally hoped that Zhou Wen would restrain himself a little and not let Lance and company see him gaming.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen opened the door, he was still playing with his phone.</p>
<p>Due to the unexpected complexity of the Maze of Lies, he had yet to completely resolve the problem.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen had to resolve the problem before the team entered the Maze of Lies. Otherwise, apart from him, everyone who entered would die.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1016'>Chapter 1016: Burden</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>This wasn’t alarmist talk because Zhou Wen had discovered that the Maze of Lies on Sunday had a terrifying taboo power.</p>
<p>Unless one had the ability to restrain taboo powers like the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, the moment one stepped into the Maze of Lies on Sunday, it was equivalent to activating a death countdown.</p>
<p>According to Zhou Wen’s constant tests during this period of time, he realized that if he didn’t enter Witch Castle within three hours after entering the maze, he would be killed by the taboo power.</p>
<p>This was the power of the rules. No matter where one was, it was inevitable as long as one didn’t leave the Maze of Lies.</p>
<p>Entering Witch Castle within three hours allowed one to obtain a two-hour death countdown inside. If one failed to enter the garden within two hours, they would also be killed by the taboo power.</p>
<p>After entering the garden, the death countdown became an hour. One could only stay in the garden for an hour, or they would also die.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that the death timer in every area wouldn’t be reset just because one entered the next area. It wouldn’t stop either.</p>
<p>In other words, if he used two and a half hours in the maze before entering Witch Castle after half an hour, the countdown in the maze would have reached zero. He would also die if he returned to the maze.</p>
<p>Therefore, although it looked like the first two regions had a longer time limit, it was actually impossible for him to spend that much time there. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to come out even if he obtained the mask.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, so he wasn’t afraid. However, if Wang Lu, Lance, and company exceeded the time limit inside, they would die.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen had already figured out these rules, but these weren’t all of Sunday’s rules. The other problems were still being tested.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, are you alright?” Lance and Sadie didn’t have any special reaction because of Zhou Wen gaming. This was because they were already used to Zhou Wen gaming and didn’t find it strange.</p>
<p>“Me? I’m fine.” The blood-colored avatar died again in-game. Zhou Wen put away his phone and looked at Lance and company in puzzlement, unsure why they were asking.</p>
<p>“Coach, don’t tell me you have been gaming in your room all day?” Sadie’s expression turned even odder as she asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Is there a problem?” Zhou Wen looked at Sadie in puzzlement.</p>
<p>As expected… Wang Lu held her forehead helplessly. She knew that Zhou Wen wouldn’t lie.</p>
<p>Lance smiled and said, “You’re very calm. It looks like you already have a card up your sleeve. However, the others are a little worried that you might give the wrong orders because you don’t understand their abilities. If you have the time, it’s best you take a look at their training. At the very least, you’d have some understanding of their abilities. That would be a good thing.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sighed and said, “That’s why I feel that it’s best I go alone to avoid leading them into trouble.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s words came from the bottom of his heart. If he were to go alone, he could activate Evil Nullification and the Heaven-Opening Scripture the entire way. He wouldn’t need to worry about the group’s survival, nor would he need to study the dungeon so clearly. There was no power inside that could kill him.</p>
<p>It didn’t seem difficult for a person to rush into the garden in reality to see if there was a mask.</p>
<p>However, the Ultimate Family Clan was definitely worried about letting him enter alone, afraid that he would take the mask for himself. Also, there was no time or opportunity for him to enter alone.</p>
<p>Gaiman had already decided to lead people into the Maze of Lies this coming Sunday.</p>
<p>Lance and Sadie exchanged looks and smiled bitterly. Zhou Wen’s thoughts were even more straightforward than they had expected. He had actually treated all the strongmen in the North District as a burden.</p>
<p>They naturally knew that it was impossible for Zhou Wen to enter the maze alone. All Lance could do was say, “It’s good to have more people. After all, the maze is strange. If anything happens, even if they can’t help, they can spread out the firepower. Why don’t…”</p>
<p>Just as Lance was about to ask him to take a look, Sadie beat him to it. “Coach, I suddenly remembered that we have something to do.”</p>
<p>With that said, Sadie pulled Lance away quickly.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” When they came to a place without anyone, Lance looked at Sadie in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Sadie said, “You wanted Coach to visit the training grounds?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. At least appease the experts from those places,” said Lance.</p>
<p>However, Sadie said, “That will probably make things worse.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Lance was momentarily taken aback.</p>
<p>“With my understanding of Coach, even if he goes to the training grounds, he will definitely find a place to lie down and game. Do you still think it’s a good idea for him to go or not?” Sadie said.</p>
<p>Lance was immediately enlightened as he nodded. “That makes sense.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The two of them had no choice but to tell Gaiman what Zhou Wen had said. Gaiman couldn’t help but frown slightly when he heard that. “Zhou Wen is indeed very capable, but he’s so arrogant. He doesn’t take this operation seriously at all. Does he treat this as child’s play?”</p>
<p>“Family Head, I think Coach naturally has his reasons for saying that.” Sadie was very confident in Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What’s the reason? He hasn’t even entered the Maze of Lies on Sunday. With his arrogance, he will probably suffer greatly.” Gaiman was already secretly considering if he should hand the final veto to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Although Frod had agreed to give him the veto rights, he couldn’t just watch as Zhou Wen made some unreasonable decisions.</p>
<p>Gaiman had already decided that if Zhou Wen’s decision was the same as his, he would listen to him for the time being. If it wasn’t, he would prioritize his own opinion.</p>
<p>He believed that the members of the Ultimate Family Clan and the experts of those places would listen to his orders.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t think too much about it. There were less than two days left until Sunday. He had to figure out the details as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The repeated deaths in-game deepened Zhou Wen’s understanding of the Maze of Lies. In the end, he was basically studying the tree and the method to kill it.</p>
<p>Although this tree might not necessarily exist in reality, there was nothing wrong with being careful. It was always better to be prepared.</p>
<p>This tree was extraordinary. It could also kill people, but its method of killing wasn’t that obvious. It was even more bizarre.</p>
<p>Time passed quickly. Seeing that there were only a few hours left until Sunday, Zhou Wen suddenly felt a strange energy fluctuation emit from his body.</p>
<p>Neonate’s evolution is complete… Zhou Wen figured out the source of the fluctuations and was immediately overjoyed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1017'>Chapter 1017: Great Demon King</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen had long been looking forward to Demonic Neonate’s evolution. Now, she was finally out.</p>
<p>He hurriedly summoned Demonic Neonate, but she didn’t seem to have changed much. She wore blackish-purple armor and hugged a Demonic Sword. She didn’t even seem to have grown taller.</p>
<p>The superficial details aren’t important. Stats are what matters. Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at Demonic Neonate’s stats. All he wanted to know was what had happened to her Wheel of Destiny when she returned to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate: Mythical (Evolvable)</p>

<p>Talent Skill: Demonic Sword</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>Terror form… Zhou Wen was dumbfounded. Demonic Neonate had just advanced to the Mythical stage. Although the Wheel of Destiny he was looking forward to hadn’t changed, she actually had the ability to transform into the Terror form. He was overwhelmed with joy.</p>
<p>Isn’t this a little too powerful? She just advanced to the Mythical stage and already has a Terror form? Zhou Wen was very curious about Demonic Neonate’s Terror form.</p>
<p>He summoned Demonic Neonate in-game and made her enter her Terror form.</p>
<p>Demonic aura spewed out from Demonic Neonate’s body, but in the next second, she vanished in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that since he hadn’t made Demonic Neonate move, she shouldn’t have moved randomly. Since she wasn’t moving, it should be an invisibility ability.</p>
<p>Is it invisibility? Zhou Wen could vaguely sense that Demonic Neonate was in front of him, but he couldn’t see her with the naked eye.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen attempted to use the Demon God Body, but he still couldn’t see Demonic Neonate. When he switched to Supreme Hell King, he still couldn’t see her. However, he could vaguely see some strange minute fluctuations in space. They were extremely tiny, and even in the Supreme Hell King state, it was very difficult to detect them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. He wanted to see what Demonic Neonate’s Terror form looked like, but no matter how he tried, he couldn’t see her. It was as though Demonic Neonate had really vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his palm, but he couldn’t touch Demonic Neonate. However, he could sense that she stood there without moving.</p>
<p>Alright, it doesn’t matter if I can’t see you. Let’s give it a try and see what your abilities are like. Zhou Wen thought for a moment. Today was the day the nine black dragons in the underground sea respawned. It was the perfect time to grind there again.</p>
<p>After entering the underground sea, Zhou Wen only summoned Demonic Neonate. He didn’t summon any other Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>When the nine black dragons saw Zhou Wen, they didn’t break their chains immediately. They just sized up Demonic Neonate in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Whenever the nine black dragons saw a Mythical Companion Beast at the same time, they would definitely break free from their shackles. Now, they didn’t do so immediately. There was only one reason—they couldn’t see Demonic Neonate. At most, they were about the same as Zhou Wen. They only felt that the space there was a little strange, so they didn’t immediately break free from the shackles.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate, let me see how strong you are. Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he ordered Demonic Neonate to kill the nine black dragons.</p>
<p>In the next second, Zhou Wen suddenly saw dragon blood spew out as a black dragon was beheaded. It died without even knowing how it died.</p>
<p>Then, Zhou Wen saw a very strange scene. The black dragons spun around like headless flies. They couldn’t discover what was attacking them. When they sensed something, their heads had already been chopped off.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Ding! Ding!</p>
<p>Moments later, the nine black dragons were killed in the sea, dyeing the nearby seawater red. Two dimensional crystals and a Companion Egg dropped.</p>
<p>Too… Too powerful… Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>The Mythical Demon Blood True Dragon was slaughtered like poultry in front of the terrifying Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen quite a number of Terror-form powerhouses, but they didn’t seem to be as strong as Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>The dimensional crystal was useless, but the Companion Egg had a Li attribute that Zhou Wen didn’t have. Now Zhou Wen had four of the nine Demon Blood True Dragons.</p>
<p>I think I can give it a try. What will happen if I kill the Guardian inside? Zhou Wen stared at the war wagon at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>In the past, he couldn’t defeat the Guardian, but now, ignoring Zhou Wen’s strength, Demonic Neonate’s Terror transformation state was already invincible.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, he opened the war wagon’s door and ordered Demonic Neonate to kill the Guardian inside.</p>
<p>Crack! The Guardian cocoon was split into two. The emperor-like Guardian with six fingers appeared in Zhou Wen’s vision.</p>
<p>Although he couldn’t see her, Zhou Wen could roughly guess that Demonic Neonate hadn’t taken action herself. She had only used the Demonic Sword to slice open the cocoon of the Guardian. Unfortunately, Zhou Wen couldn’t see the Demonic Sword that had Terror-transformed.</p>
<p>The Guardian seemed to be able to see Demonic Neonate. He stared intently at her as his face turned pale.</p>
<p>The invisible Demonic Sword slashed down again. The six-fingered Guardian seemed to be able to see where the Demonic Sword was. The ring on his finger glowed brightly at the same time as it rapidly spun. His figure also teleported and vanished.</p>
<p>However, when he appeared again, his body was split into two by a sword.</p>
<p>In the next second, a scene that left Zhou Wen dumbfounded appeared. The Demonic Sword suddenly revealed its size as demonic aura surged from it, condensing into Grim Demon’s figure. He actually grabbed the Guardian’s body and devoured it. In a few mouthfuls, he completely devoured the Guardian’s corpse before automatically returning to the Demonic Sword and quickly disappearing.</p>
<p>Grim Demon is still around? Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He imagined that Grim Demon would be absorbed by Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>‘Killed Guardian Demon Master.’ A notification popped up in-game.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>So this Guardian is called Demon Master. Unfortunately, such a powerful Guardian was killed by Demonic Neonate just like that. It didn’t get the chance to reveal its abilities. With a thought, Zhou Wen recalled the Guardian of Ant City.</p>
<p>However, on second thought, killing the Guardian didn’t seem to be of much use now. It wouldn’t be too late to kill it in the future.</p>
<p>The most important thing now was to deal with the tree in the Maze of Lies.</p>
<p>Previously, so many Companion Beasts had failed to kill the tree. The Terror-form Ice Dragon King’s items couldn’t be taken into the game, so Zhou Wen had been vexed about it.</p>
<p>Now, with Demonic Neonate in her Terror form, it shouldn’t be a problem to slice through the tree.</p>
<p>After taking Demonic Neonate to the Maze of Lies and arriving at the garden, Demonic Neonate walked towards the tree before Zhou Wen could give her an order.</p>
<p>As Demonic Neonate approached, the tree, that had formerly remained motionless like a mountain, suddenly moved. Its leaves shook and the tree trembled. Its roots rose up, revealing a tree hole.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate walked towards the tree hole. Zhou Wen hurriedly controlled the blood-colored avatar to follow and see what was inside.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1018'>Chapter 1018: Wooden Hut</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>There was a strange spatial distortion at the entrance of the tree hole. He felt a slight spatial fluctuation when he passed through it.</p>
<p>After entering the tree hole, the scene he saw left him slightly taken aback. Inside was a wooden hut, not the grave or tombstone that Zhou Wen had imagined.</p>
<p>All the tools in the wooden house seemed to be carved from the tree itself.</p>
<p>There was a wooden bed, a wooden table, a wooden stool, and a wooden rack. All sorts of equipment looked ancient and artistic. On the wooden rack were many books.</p>
<p>On the table was an open book, as though someone had been reading it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t see any other creatures despite looking through the entire hut.</p>
<p>This is a game. Logically speaking, only dimensional items can appear in-game. Could these books be dimensional items? Zhou Wen saw that Demonic Neonate had already walked to the wooden table and was looking at the opened book on it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also went over to take a look and realized that he didn’t recognize a single word on it. It was a mess of words of an unknown language—he couldn’t understand a single word.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate extended her tiny hand and the book flew up by itself. It arrived in front of her and floated above her palm.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate actually likes to read after her evolution. This is a good phenomenon. Zhou Wen was rather gratified.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate was good in every way, but she was just too ferocious. She usually didn’t say a word and she attacked only when death was certain from a single strike. She didn’t give anyone a chance to counterattack. She was like a cold-blooded killer.</p>
<p>Although Demonic Neonate was flawless as a Companion Beast, Zhou Wen felt that she was, after all, an intelligent creature with feelings. It was better to have some humanity.</p>
<p>Reading could enrich people with feelings. This seemed to be a good sign.</p>
<p>“Neonate, what’s written on it…” Before Zhou Wen could finish his sentence, he saw Demonic Neonate grab the two sides of the book, open her mouth wide, and eat the book like she was eating a cake.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“…” Zhou Wen looked at Demonic Neonate in a daze, unable to say a word. He realized that he had misunderstood something.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate didn’t stop at all. Her mouth opened and closed as she swallowed the entire book with a few bites.</p>
<p>After she was done eating, she still hadn’t had enough. She walked to the bookshelf and devoured the other books one by one. When she had finished, she even licked her lips, looking like she hadn’t had enough.</p>
<p>“Why are you eating those books?” Zhou Wen finally reacted and asked Demonic Neonate in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Food,” Demonic Neonate said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was helpless. It was unlikely that Demonic Neonate would explain it clearly. He still didn’t know what the books were.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the screen went black as the blood-colored avatar died again.</p>
<p>How can this be? The one-hour time limit in the garden shouldn’t be up yet? Could it be that there’s a different time limit in the treehouse? Zhou Wen guessed as he started the dungeon again.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was certain that there was no mask in-game. There was only a treehouse in the tree.</p>
<p>Is Frod lying, or is it really different in reality? Zhou Wen was almost confident of bringing Wang Lu, Lance, and company out alive, but there were still some things he wanted to figure out.</p>
<p>After entering the garden again, the tree automatically opened the entrance to the wooden hut when it saw Demonic Neonate. This time, Zhou Wen paid special attention to the time inside the tree hole before discovering an extremely strange phenomenon.</p>
<p>The flow of time in the tree hole’s wooden hut was much faster than outside. An hour outside was only a minute here.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had only discovered the changes in his body after using the Eight Perfections Wisdom and Hell King Supremacy, allowing him to determine that the flow of time here was different.</p>
<p>Even if he used the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, it was useless against the abnormal flow of time here. This was because such a flow of time was normal in the tree hole’s wooden hut. It wasn’t a taboo power.</p>
<p>Seeing that the books in the wooden hut didn’t respawn again, Zhou Wen hurriedly left the tree hole.</p>
<p>He was afraid that staying inside where time flowed too quickly would affect his true body. That wouldn’t be good.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it was only a game and it didn’t affect his true body. However, the secret of the garden seemed to end there. There were no graves or masks.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen knew the dungeon like the back of his hand. All he needed to do was wait for tomorrow to head to the Maze of Lies in reality to see if it was different.</p>
<p>While it was still early, Zhou Wen went to the underground sea again. The cocoon in the war wagon hadn’t respawned; he didn’t know if it would respawn in the future either.</p>
<p>With the underground sea’s Guardian gone, Zhou Wen made another trip to Ant City.</p>
<p>After being wrecked by Ant City’s Guardian for so long, I can finally do something about it. Zhou Wen was somewhat excited.</p>
<p>Ant City was a dungeon that had come with the phone. Ant City’s Guardian was also the first Guardian Zhou Wen had seen. Zhou Wen was still looking forward to killing Ant City’s Guardian and clearing the dungeon.</p>
<p>He stormed all the way through Ant City and destroyed the Golden Flying Ant’s nest, exposing the Guardian Egg.</p>
<p>“Neonate, kill it.” Zhou Wen floated in the air, waiting to see the Ant City Guardian get killed.</p>
<p>After Demonic Neonate transformed into her Terror form, her figure vanished from Zhou Wen’s sight. At the same time, he couldn’t see the demonic sword as she instantly cleaved open the Guardian cocoon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw the Ant City Guardian again. At that moment, the Ant City Guardian seemed to have grown a lot.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen remembered that the last time he saw her, she still looked like a girl, but now, she looked completely mature. She exuded the charm of a mature woman.</p>
<p>Her lascivious body curves, orange-red pupils, and long hair made Zhou Wen almost not dare look at her.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen discovered that the feelers on the Guardian’s head and the transparent wings on her back had vanished. She looked no different from a human.</p>
<p>This is the first time I’ve seen a Guardian who can constantly grow. What’s this fellow’s background? I wonder which dimensional race she represents? Just as Zhou Wen was thinking, the Terror-form demonic sword slashed at the Guardian again.</p>
<p>Typical Guardians couldn’t even see the attack, much less resist it. Just as Zhou Wen thought that the Guardian was about to be killed, he saw the Guardian’s beautiful hands clasp together and clamp down on the Demonic Sword that came slashing down.</p>
<p>At the same time, a strange power fluctuation spread out from the pair of beautiful hands. With a terrifying power fluctuation, the Guardian’s figure vanished in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Not good! Zhou Wen immediately realized something as he quickly retreated.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1019'>Chapter 1019: Final Veto Rights</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sensed that Demonic Neonate was moving at high speeds. In the next second, the terrifying collision produced an unimaginable explosion and shockwave that instantly reduced Ant City to ruins.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar used the Shell Dragon armor’s Absolute Defense to block the terrifying strike, but in the next second, Zhou Wen felt his heart palpitate. An invisible force struck the blood-colored avatar’s body and penetrated the armor, causing its body to explode. The game screen went black.</p>
<p>Terror form… That fellow hasn’t come out of the Guardian cocoon… But she already has the ability to transform into the Terror form… Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew very well that it was the power of the Terror form. Furthermore, it was one of the stronger ones. At the same time, Zhou Wen’s previous guess had been confirmed.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate’s Great Demon King state wasn’t an invisibility state. It could even be said that it wasn’t invisibility.</p>
<p>It was only because a Terror form’s lifeform was too high-level that it couldn’t be seen.</p>
<p>However, not every Terror-grade creature could reach such a high-grade Terror form. Up to now, the Terror-grade creatures that Zhou Wen couldn’t see were Demonic Neonate and Ant City’s Guardian.</p>
<p>It was hard to say who was stronger between Demonic Neonate and Ant City’s Guardian, but Zhou Wen’s strength was much weaker. Demonic Neonate wasn’t a protective Companion Beast, so if the Ant City’s Guardian chose to attack Zhou Wen, it was impossible for Demonic Neonate to constantly protect him. As long as Zhou Wen was killed, the game would end. The Ant City’s Guardian didn’t need to fight Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>Her growth is really fast. I wonder when she obtained the ability to transform. Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>He had downloaded quite a number of dungeons, but this dungeon that had existed from the beginning had yet to be cleared. It looked like he still needed some time.</p>
<p>He didn’t attempt it again. He couldn’t even see her. He had no right to fight the Ant City Guardian.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Actually, if I use Truth Listener to its limits, I can still sense a tiny spatial fluctuation. However, that level isn’t enough to help in a battle. Zhou Wen felt that he needed to advance to the Mythical stage to see Demonic Neonate’s Terror form.</p>
<p>Mythical stage. I’m only one step away from advancing to the Mythical stage. How can I raise the Glimmer to a Perfect Body? Could it be that I really have to teleport to other planets? However, I don’t have the ability to survive in space as someone who’s not at the Mythical stage. I have no way of returning. By the time I could teleport back in a month, I would have long died. After some thought, Zhou Wen had only one solution.</p>
<p>He could use the positioning teleportation ability of the New Era Life Soul to position himself on Earth before using Glimmer to teleport out. Then, he could use the positioning teleportation ability of the New Era Life Soul to return.</p>
<p>The only thing he wasn’t sure of was if the positioning teleportation ability of the New Era could teleport between space. If it couldn’t, he was dead meat in space.</p>
<p>After some hesitation, Zhou Wen didn’t dare continue trying.</p>
<p>He planned to return and think of a way to obtain some space capsules and space suits. After teleporting to other planets, even if he couldn’t teleport back, he could still last for a month on them and wait for the teleportation function of the Glimmer Life Soul to finish the cooldown.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Finally, on Saturday night, Gaiman got Lance to find Zhou Wen. Everyone who was prepared to enter the Maze of Lies had already gathered at the door.</p>
<p>Gaiman would personally lead the team this time. Among the younger generation, only Lance would accompany them. The rest were middle-aged or elderly.</p>
<p>Basically, anyone who could enter the maze had at least one Mythical Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Wang Lu was considered a unique existence among them. No one knew how strong she was, nor did anyone care. It was enough as long as she could defeat the twin Destiny Witches during the draw.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to accompany you in?” Li Xuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. Take care of Ya’er.” Zhou Wen put Ya’er down and stroked her head. “I’ll be back soon. Wait here.”</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, are you ready?” Gemar asked.</p>
<p>Although he was somewhat displeased that Zhou Wen hadn’t participated in the training, he knew that as a secretary, he couldn’t show his emotions, so his attitude remained very good.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded slightly and came in front of Gaiman. “Mr. Gaiman, there’s something I need to confirm. Do I have complete say on this operation?”</p>
<p>Gaiman frowned slightly. Gemar hurriedly added, “The situation in a dimensional zone is ever-changing. There are many unexpected situations that require immediate reaction. If there’s time to discuss, it will naturally be up to you.”</p>
<p>Gemar’s words were rather respectful, but the meaning behind them was that everyone would act according to the situation.</p>
<p>“Mr. Gaiman, do you share the same view?” Zhou Wen asked Gaiman directly.</p>
<p>Gaiman pondered for a moment and said, “You haven’t entered the Maze of Lies on Sunday. You might not know many things.”</p>
<p>“The information you gave me is sufficiently detailed. I don’t need to go personally to know what’s going on inside the maze.” Zhou Wen saw that Gaiman wasn’t being certain, so he said, “I have an agreement with your family. I will definitely enter the maze, but if I don’t have a hundred percent say, I wish to enter the maze alone. If you are worried, you can get Lance to enter with me. Otherwise, I refuse to participate in this operation.”</p>
<p>With that said, it wasn’t just the local elites. Even the experts from the Ultimate Family Clan couldn’t hold back. Zhou Wen made it sound as though they were a burden.</p>
<p>“Isn’t your request a little too demanding?” Gaiman said as he stared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“We agreed on me having the final veto previously. If you can’t abide by the agreement, I won’t take the risk of entering the dimensional zone,” Zhou Wen said seriously.</p>
<p>“Mr. Gaiman, since he’s afraid to go, why are you forcing him?”</p>
<p>“He’s just a young man who doesn’t know better. Ignore him.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Gaiman, let’s go in. It’s fine if he doesn’t go. Would we not succeed without him?”</p>
<p>The local powerhouses were already displeased with Zhou Wen, but they were even more displeased now.</p>
<p>However, Gaiman was in a dilemma. This was because Frod had exhorted him repeatedly that Zhou Wen had to be present for this operation to succeed. He had to take Zhou Wen in.</p>
<p>Gaiman pondered for a long time before giving in. “Alright. Since it’s an agreement, we’ll do as you wish. You have the final say.”</p>
<p>Everyone was somewhat displeased with Gaiman’s compromise, but since it was Gaiman’s decision, they had no choice.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1020'>Chapter 1020: Different</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Although Gaiman had agreed, Zhou Wen didn’t relax.</p>
<p>The human heart was unpredictable. No one knew what would happen after entering.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen needed to do what needed to be done in exchange for the intelligence Frod had provided him. If they had a death wish, Zhou Wen wouldn’t be able to stop them.</p>
<p>“After entering the maze, follow me. Listen to me. Don’t believe what others say,” Zhou Wen whispered to Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Wang Lu nodded slightly.</p>
<p>Everyone arrived in front of the maze and answered the questions in the order they had arranged.</p>
<p>As some questions were questions that couldn’t be answered, some could only give up. They couldn’t return for another question in a day.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Ultimate Family Clan had prepared many people just in case. Even if a portion of them couldn’t enter, it wouldn’t hinder their plans.</p>
<p>There were three indispensable people in the team—Zhou Wen, Wang Lu, and Gaiman.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at the crowd. There were nearly thirty people. Most of the powerhouses in the North District who had Mythical Companion Beasts were here.</p>
<p>However, if they continued answering the questions one by one, it would probably take thirty minutes for everyone to gather inside. It would be such a waste of time.</p>
<p>“Mr. Gaiman, must so many people enter?” Zhou Wen asked Gaiman.</p>
<p>“The maze is too dangerous. It’s easier to deal with any accidents with more people,” Gaiman said.</p>
<p>“Alright then. What’s Wang Lu’s place in line?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“As no one will be able to pass the test of the Destiny Witches if Wang Lu doesn’t enter, she has to be one of the first to enter. We will get the experienced members of the two families to enter before her in case anything happens when inside,” Gaiman said.</p>
<p>“Change it. Let Wang Lu be the last to enter,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That’s not good, right? If she can’t enter as the last one, wouldn’t our previous efforts be in vain?” Gemar said.</p>
<p>“Remember that I call the shots here. If I say she’s the last, she’s the last. Is there a problem?” Zhou Wen said to Gemar.</p>
<p>Gemar’s expression changed slightly, but he couldn’t say a word. All he could do was look at Gaiman.</p>
<p>“With Wang Lu’s ability, it’s unlikely that she won’t be able to enter. Then let her be the last,” Gaiman said, unwilling to clash with Zhou Wen over such a trivial matter.</p>
<p>With Gaiman’s words, Gemar changed the order of entry.</p>
<p>Others believed that Zhou Wen had taken a fancy to the young and beautiful Wang Lu and wanted to show off in front of her, but they didn’t say a word. All they did was look down on him. At this moment, Zhou Wen was still only thinking about women. He was ultimately a young man.</p>
<p>How could they know that if by entering half an hour later, the safe period would be decreased by half an hour? If something happened inside and they failed to come out in time as planned, this might save her life.</p>
<p>One by one, everyone answered the questions and entered the maze. Many people had to give up answering because they had encountered questions that meant certain death. Only about half of them could really enter.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was originally second last, but after some thought, he got Wang Lu to answer the question first.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Zhou Wen wanted to ensure his safety, but he wanted to know what question a person like Wang Lu would encounter.</p>
<p>When Wang Lu walked to the door, a problem immediately appeared on it: Is one plus one equal to two?</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately rendered speechless. There was actually such a question.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, Wang Lu successfully entered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen went up to answer the question again and saw the question on the door: Are humans born evil or good by nature?</p>
<p>“My life doesn’t need simple beauty.” Zhou Wen decisively activated the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and randomly chose one before successfully entering Sunday’s Maze of Lies.</p>
<p>Including Zhou Wen and Wang Lu, a total of seventeen people entered. Gaiman and Gemar were among them, and Lance had successfully entered too.</p>
<p>Gaiman had already arranged for people to take action after Zhou Wen entered.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t know that there was a time limit, he knew that he couldn’t waste time here.</p>
<p>Soon, the group arrived in front of the carousel. There was really a Devil Clown there. When he saw everyone, the six magic balls in his hand shot out.</p>
<p>Gaiman directly summoned an Ice Nightmare. The ice gas that the Ice Nightmare spewed out actually froze the six magic balls, preventing them from bouncing again.</p>
<p>The Devil Clown phased away as one of them summoned a bat-like Mythical Companion Beast. The bat emitted a sound wave that made the stealthy clown appear. He couldn’t maintain his stealth any longer.</p>
<p>Everyone joined forces to defeat the enemy and successfully killed the troublesome Devil Clown. No one was injured at all.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t find it strange. This was because they had already sacrificed quite a number of people to figure out the information on Devil Clown. If they couldn’t kill it, they would really be letting down the people who had died in the Maze of Lies.</p>
<p>“Keep in line with our previous training. Keep moving forward in this state.” Gaiman led the team in the direction of Witch Castle.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had actually encountered a few dimensional creatures in-game, but their range of activity wasn’t in this area. Logically speaking, after killing the Devil Clown, they should be able to reach Witch’s Castle without any obstructions.</p>
<p>However, not long after they proceeded, they suddenly saw a white wolf with three heads and two wings on its back tear through the air. One wolf head spewed out flames while the other spewed out ice mist. The wolf head in the middle emitted an aural attack.</p>
<p>“It’s a three-headed wolf. Don’t panic. Follow the plan according to our training.” Gaiman continued commanding.</p>
<p>Although the three-headed wolf was powerful, it was difficult for it to defeat more than ten Mythical Companion Beasts. It was quickly killed.</p>
<p>“Although the Mythical creatures here are powerful, it’s easy to enter Witch Castle with our Mythical Companion Beasts.” As a local bigshot expressed this statement, he deliberately shot a glance at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>He seemed to mean that even without Zhou Wen, they could still complete the mission. Zhou Wen was redundant.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sincerely hoped that he was redundant. Being safe was better than anything else. He wanted to complete the mission quickly and return.</p>
<p>However, just as the person signaled that, he suddenly saw the three-headed wolf’s corpse explode. Blood and flesh splattered everywhere.</p>
<p>Many people were stained with blood. At that moment, they suddenly heard strange cries coming from all directions. They sounded like crying banshees.</p>
<p>They could vaguely see some creature in the distance approaching them.</p>
<p>This seems a little different from in-game… Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown, but he had already guessed what creature it was.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1021'>Chapter 1021: Evil Puppeteer</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>It was very difficult to communicate in the Maze of Lies. This was because the silencer had used Silence on them. Usually, they could communicate through handwritten words, but in an emergency, it depended on everyone’s reaction.</p>
<p>“Retreat now.” Gaiman didn’t have the time to write too many words. He only wrote two words for everyone to see before retreating towards the door.</p>
<p>Clearly, Gaiman and company didn’t know what was about to appear. They had only explored the parts related to Witch Castle in the past and hadn’t explored all of the Maze of Lies, nor had they seen all the dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had explored the entire maze. He had seen almost all the dimensional creatures inside.</p>
<p>Although he had never seen the three-headed wolf’s corpse self-destruct, he could roughly guess the dimensional creature that was about to arrive from its sound.</p>
<p>If that thing really comes, those people who are stained with the three-headed wolf’s blood won’t have it easy. Zhou Wen swept his gaze and quickly confirmed who the people stained with the blood were.</p>
<p>Wang Lu, who was by Zhou Wen’s side, wasn’t stained by the wolf blood. Zhou Wen was relieved when he saw that Lance wasn’t stained with the wolf blood either.</p>
<p>However, nine out of the seventeen people were stained with wolf blood. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown slightly. The self-destruction of the three-headed wolf was really timely. It happened to self-destruct in the middle of everyone. Could it be that it was a suicide bomber?</p>
<p>Upon thinking of this possibility, Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed. If the three-headed wolf was really sending itself to its death, the Maze of Lies in reality was much more terrifying than in-game.</p>
<p>The dimensional creatures in the game kept to their own territories. They would only appear when they were triggered.</p>
<p>The three-headed wolf in real life had run over and infected so many people with its wolf blood. This was to pave the way for another dimensional creature to appear.</p>
<p>When everyone retreated to the door, they stood in formation with their backs against the exit. The Companion Beasts were also prepared to fight as they looked in the direction of the strange sound.</p>
<p>Soon, everyone saw blood-colored puppets appear everywhere. They looked like humans and were very well-made. They were even wearing clothes.</p>
<p>However, at their joints, thin threads extended into the distance.</p>
<p>It’s indeed the Devil Puppeteer. Zhou Wen knew that his guess was right when he saw the puppets.</p>
<p>However, in-game, the Devil Puppeteer was in the Puppet Hall and wouldn’t run out by himself.</p>
<p>Yet, here he was. Furthermore, those people had already been stained with the blood of the three-headed wolf. It happened to match the skill of the Devil Puppeteer. In a while, those who were stained with the wolf blood would probably become puppets.</p>
<p>Of course, this was only Zhou Wen’s guess.</p>
<p>If the Devil Puppeteer had tampered with the three-headed wolf in advance, the blood could be used by him. If he hadn’t tampered with it in advance, the people who were stained with the three-headed wolf’s blood wouldn’t be affected.</p>
<p>Gaiman and company ordered their Companion Beasts to attack the puppets, but in the next second, some were horrified at what happened.</p>
<p>Strange threads appeared on the bodies of the people stained with wolf blood. The threads were like puppets that extended deep into the maze.</p>
<p>The people and Companion Beasts with fine threads on their bodies found that they were no longer in control of their bodies. They seemed to be controlled by the threads as they lunged at their companions.</p>
<p>Such an unforeseen event exceeded everyone’s expectations. It was a mess.</p>
<p>Before they could meet the Destiny Witches, they were already having in-fighting.</p>
<p>The puppets also rushed forward to join the battle. The scene became extremely chaotic.</p>
<p>Gaiman wanted to sever the threads on those people and see if he could save them. Unfortunately, when their weapons slashed down at the threads, they found the threads akin to flowing water. The threads didn’t break under the weapons’ slices.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had long expected this outcome. He pulled Wang Lu back and waited for the Devil Puppeteer to appear.</p>
<p>Killing these puppets was useless. The puppeteer had countless puppets, so it was useless to decrease their numbers. He had to wait for the puppeteer to appear before killing him.</p>
<p>Gaiman and company clearly realized the problem. They also wanted to find the dimensional creature controlling the puppets. One even charged in the direction of the threads.</p>
<p>From Zhou Wen’s point of view, these actions were futile. Like Demonic Neonate, the puppeteer was very good at hiding himself. He was a fellow who liked to kill others while in hiding. It was impossible to find him by following the threads. It would only place one in danger.</p>
<p>Indeed, after the person rushed over with his Companion Beast, there was quickly nothing from him. He was nowhere to be seen, not even his corpse.</p>
<p>“Let’s follow the threads and rush over together.” Gaiman wrote a few words wanting to follow the threads on the puppets.</p>
<p>The puppets revived after being killed. It was useless killing them anymore. They had to kill the person controlling the puppet.</p>
<p>“Do not go over.” Zhou Wen wrote on the cardboard.</p>
<p>When he first encountered the puppeteer, he had suffered the same way. He thought that he could find the puppeteer by following the threads, but what awaited him was a death trap.</p>
<p>“If we don’t go over, death awaits us. We can only go.” Gaiman quickly wrote.</p>
<p>“According to the agreement, I call the shots. Stay here. No one is allowed to go over.” Zhou Wen quickly wrote a line.</p>
<p>“Give me a reason,” Gaiman wrote as he stared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I think only by staying here will there be a chance of survival. Going over will only lead to death.” Zhou Wen wrote.</p>
<p>“Staying here is the only way to die. Mr. Gaiman, don’t worry about him. Let’s rush over and capture the fellow who controls Old Liu and the others.” One person wrote a line before rushing towards the other end of the threads.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no reason to stop others if they were suicidal. After all, their lives had nothing to do with him.</p>
<p>The others were also eager to give it a try. Clearly, they felt that if this continued, unless they killed all their controlled people and puppets, there was no chance of survival.</p>
<p>“Give Zhou Wen a chance.” As Lance controlled his Companion Beasts to circle around the puppets, he rushed over and raised the board in his hand.</p>
<p>As communication was inconvenient, many people wanted to say something, but they had no time to write in battle.</p>
<p>Gaiman looked at the spot where the person had gone and saw that he had vanished silently like the previous person. Finally, he gritted his teeth and ordered everyone to continue resisting the puppet’s attack. He gave up the thought of following the threads.</p>
<p>However, their situation became worse and worse. This was because nine people had been controlled. When they fought the nine people, it wasn’t appropriate for them to kill them. This resulted in them being at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with a large number of puppets charging at them, it became increasingly difficult for them to deal with them.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1022'>Chapter 1022: Carrying Her Out</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Gradually, even Gaiman felt a little regretful. They could neither retreat nor advance. They were trapped by the puppets and didn’t even have the chance to follow the threads.</p>
<p>Someone was already injured. Although it didn’t look serious, it was a very bad sign.</p>
<p>Some people had no choice but to be ruthless to their companions who were controlled like puppets. If they didn’t do so, they would be killed.</p>
<p>However, killing a companion to survive wasn’t a pleasurable thing for anyone.</p>
<p>Therefore, they couldn’t help but blame it on Zhou Wen. They would occasionally glare at him angrily.</p>
<p>If they could speak, Zhou Wen would probably be drowned by their saliva.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t care about their expressions. He had been using Truth Listener to monitor the commotion nearby, hoping to discover the puppeteer as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This only made it appear as though he was ignoring their angry gazes. What was even more infuriating was that Zhou Wen wasn’t participating in the battle. All he did was watch from the back with Wang Lu, like a scion who had brought a beautiful lady out on a vacation.</p>
<p>We didn’t invite you here to hit on chicks… If he could speak, Gemar would have reprimanded Zhou Wen loudly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he could only keep it to himself. The situation was getting worse. A large number of puppets had surrounded them, preventing him from having the time to write.</p>
<p>More and more people were getting injured. Gaiman was already considering a retreat. Otherwise, not only would he not be able to save the nine people controlled by the puppet, but everyone else would also die here.</p>
<p>However, to sacrifice nine people just like that without having done anything after entering was unacceptable.</p>
<p>In fact, many people already had the intention to retreat. The present situation didn’t seem to allow them to continue.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen, who hadn’t participated in the battle, moved. Everyone saw him pull out the Bamboo Blade at his waist and vanish.</p>
<p>Where’s Zhou Wen? Everyone looked around but didn’t find Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>A black-robed dimensional creature fell from the bell tower beside them. When it fell to the ground, its body had already been split into two.</p>
<p>The puppets also stopped when the dimensional creature fell to the ground. The threads on the nine people who had been controlled fell off, restoring their control over their bodies.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>The string puppets shattered one after another. Everyone couldn’t help but look up and see Zhou Wen standing on the bell tower, sheathing his Bamboo Blade.</p>
<p>“To Witch Castle.” After Zhou Wen came down, he wrote three words on a board.</p>
<p>“Everyone is injured. Shall we rest for a while?” Gaiman also wrote on the cardboard.</p>
<p>The previous battle had injured most people, especially the nine controlled people. Their injuries were rather serious.</p>
<p>This was because they weren’t afraid of death when they were controlled. They had been risking their lives without any regard for themselves. Therefore, they were severely injured.</p>
<p>“Send back all those who are injured. The rest will follow me.” Zhou Wen wrote.</p>
<p>“Our injuries aren’t serious. We can continue fighting after some rest.” The big shots who had come from those places changed their impression of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen said that, it was as though he treated them as a burden. It displeased them greatly.</p>
<p>“Time is life in such a place. We have to make the best use of every second. I don’t have the time to wait.” After Zhou Wen wrote the words, he pulled Wang Lu towards Witch Castle.</p>
<p>“Old Zhao, go back now. We’ll be out soon.” Gaiman thought for a moment and decided to let them return first.</p>
<p>“Go ahead. We’ll recuperate here before chasing after you. Or we can meet you guys back here.” Old Zhao wrote.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Gaiman thought for a moment and wrote again, “However, you have to be careful. If any dimensional creatures appear again, leave immediately.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Old Zhao agreed.</p>
<p>Gaiman chased after Zhou Wen with the uninjured Lance, Gemar, and two other members of the Ultimate Family Clan who were slightly injured.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there were no more accidents along the way. The group successfully entered Witch Castle.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had only seen cartoon versions of the witches in-game. Upon comparison, he realized that these witches were indeed rather beautiful and weren’t as cute as in-game.</p>
<p>“Welcome to the House of Destiny…” The black-and-white witch began explaining the rules of the game just like in the game.</p>
<p>“Wang Lu, thank you.” Gaiman looked at Wang Lu and showed her the words on the board.</p>
<p>Wang Lu nodded and was about to draw a card when she was stopped by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you’re fine? If you aren’t 100% confident, you don’t have to draw. I have a solution,” Zhou Wen asked as he wrote a few words on her palm.</p>
<p>“No problem. Don’t worry.” Wang Lu also wrote on Zhou Wen’s palm.</p>
<p>“That’s good.” Only then did Zhou Wen feel relieved.</p>
<p>Since Wang Lu was so confident, there shouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p>Wang Lu walked in front of the white-robed witch and reached out to draw a card. When she flipped it open, it was the mask card.</p>
<p>Her luck sure is good. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but feel mixed emotions when he saw the door behind the twin witches open.</p>
<p>We’ve finally come this far. Gaiman looked at the space behind the door. He was somewhat nervous as he led his men towards the door.</p>
<p>“Go back now,” Zhou Wen wrote on Wang Lu’s palm.</p>
<p>“We’re already here. Can’t I go in and take a look?” Wang Lu wrote.</p>
<p>“No, you have to leave immediately. It will be troublesome if there’s no time.” Zhou Wen urged her to leave the maze.</p>
<p>“What do you mean there’s no time?” Wang Lu asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“I’ll explain it to you later. Now, you have to leave the maze immediately. You definitely can’t wait for me inside,” Zhou Wen exhorted again.</p>
<p>However, seeing Wang Lu’s curious expression, he knew that she definitely wouldn’t leave so easily.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pondered for a moment before lifting Wang Lu up. Ignoring her objections, he carried her and sped off.</p>
<p>After running all the way to the entrance of the maze, Zhou Wen threw her out before turning to head for Witch Castle.</p>
<p>“Damn it!” Wang Lu looked hatefully at the maze door in front of her, but she wasn’t really angry. She couldn’t help but laugh when she thought of how Zhou Wen had carried her out.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Seeing that Old Zhao and company were still inside, Zhou Wen wrote. “All of you can leave. There’s no need to stay here. Otherwise, there will be danger.”</p>
<p>“We are willing to stay. There’s no need for you to worry.” Old Zhao was very stubborn and refused to leave.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered to say anything else as he headed for the garden.</p>
<p>I hope Gaiman and company are fine. When Zhou Wen rushed to the garden, Gaiman and company had already entered without waiting for Zhou Wen to return.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1023'>Chapter 1023: Something Happens Again</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen passed through Witch Castle and arrived at the garden. He saw Gaiman and company standing motionless in the garden as though they were possessed.</p>
<p>What happened? Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>Although there was a Shapeshifting Beast in the garden, with Gaiman and company’s abilities, it wouldn’t be easy for the Shapeshifting Beast to kill them. He had only taken about ten minutes to take Wang Lu out and return.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t believe that Gaiman, Lance, and company had been tricked by the Shapeshifting Beast in such a short period.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Gaiman and company were only standing in the garden. There were no wounds on their bodies, and there were no signs of battle around them. It didn’t look like a battle had just happened.</p>
<p>However, Gaiman and company stood there motionless like statues.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked towards the center of the garden, where Gaiman and company were facing.</p>
<p>There’s no tree… Zhou Wen was immediately alarmed.</p>
<p>The other parts of the garden looked identical to the ones in-game, but there was no tree in the middle.</p>
<p>There was a grave at the spot where the tree was supposed to be. In front of the grave was a tombstone, and on the tombstone was a strange mask.</p>
<p>The mask was like a ghoul, but it looked a little like a clown. It was strange and comical, different from any mask Zhou Wen had seen before.</p>
<p>Gaiman, Lance, and company stared intently at the mask on the tombstone. They didn’t even blink. Their breathing seemed to have stopped.</p>
<p>There’s really a grave and mask. Frod wasn’t lying. Zhou Wen sized up the mask. He activated Truth Listener and the Heaven-Opening Scripture to their limits.</p>
<p>However, as he watched, he realized that he couldn’t move his gaze away from the mask.</p>
<p>The eye sockets of the mask seemed to be two black holes that wanted to suck away Zhou Wen’s soul.</p>
<p>Not good! Zhou Wen was alarmed. His first reaction was to summon Demonic Neonate, but he realized that he couldn’t even summon his Companion Beast.</p>
<p>It was as if there was some mysterious force blocking his thoughts, preventing him from contacting his Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Damn it, what’s going on? Zhou Wen didn’t have time to be shocked and angry. He first attempted to switch Essence Energy Arts. They could be used, but his body still couldn’t move.</p>
<p>Regardless of which Life Soul or Life Providence he used, his gaze was firmly fixated on the mask, and his body couldn’t move.</p>
<p>It’s over! Zhou Wen became disheartened.</p>
<p>Now, there was really nothing he could do.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was only glad that he had forcefully sent Wang Lu out. Otherwise, she would have died here as well.</p>
<p>He switched his Life Soul to the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. The garden had an hour limit. By only being able to stand there immobile, he would definitely die once the hour was up without the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder.</p>
<p>Even with the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, Zhou Wen didn’t know how long he could live.</p>
<p>He didn’t believe that the mask only mesmerized people into standing there. It definitely had other abilities. It might even eat people.</p>
<p>I can still last for a period of time with the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, but Lance and company don’t have it. If they can’t leave this place within an hour, I’m afraid they’ll die immediately. Zhou Wen estimated that there was only about forty minutes left until the hour limit in the garden.</p>
<p>What can I do? Countless thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind, but he couldn’t think of a solution.</p>
<p>He couldn’t move his body or contact his Companion Beast. Although he could use his Essence Energy Arts, they weren’t enough to free him from the strange power of the mask.</p>
<p>As time ticked by, cold sweat broke out on Zhou Wen’s forehead. As the hour was getting closer, he still couldn’t think of a way to save Lance and company.</p>
<p>Knock! Knock!</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen heard a strange sound coming from the grave. It was a very dull knocking sound.</p>
<p>He kept hearing the sound because the Truth Listener earring had been on his ear the entire time. Its ability was still working, allowing Zhou Wen to hear that the sound came from the grave.</p>
<p>The soil above the grave trembled and with a dull sound, the pile of soil rose as though something was about to drill out.</p>
<p>I knew it. Something happens every time I enter a dimensional zone in real life. Will I be eaten by the dead this time? Zhou Wen was extremely depressed.</p>
<p>He wasn’t afraid because there were no such things as supernatural beings in this era. All of them were dimensional creatures. Since ghosts and gods were dimensional creatures, what was there to be afraid of?</p>
<p>Knock! Knock!</p>
<p>The sound from the grave continued to sound, becoming clearer and clearer. It was no longer as dull as before.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen realized that in the grave, a strange box appeared as though some force was pushing it from beneath.</p>
<p>That’s a coffin? The coffins Zhou Wen had seen in the past were squarish, but the style of this coffin was somewhat strange. It was a hexagon.</p>
<p>Knock! Knock!</p>
<p>The sound came again, and the coffin trembled with the sound. Now, it was certain that the sound came from inside the coffin. It looked like something was about to rush out.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was thinking about it, he suddenly heard a loud bang. The coffin lid flew up and Zhou Wen saw a hand reach out from the coffin and grab the edge of the coffin.</p>
<p>It was a pale hand with slender fingers, but it was very thin as though it was malnourished.</p>
<p>The fingernails weren’t long, but they showed a strange jade color. They didn’t look like normal cuticles.</p>
<p>Soon, another hand extended out. A pair of hands pressed down on the sides of the coffin. It looked like it was using a lot of strength. Even the tendons on the back of the hands protruded.</p>
<p>Then, Zhou Wen saw a head slowly rise up.</p>
<p>Long hair covered his face, making it impossible to see what he looked like. From his figure, he should be a man.</p>
<p>The man stood up from the coffin. His figure was about the same as Zhou Wen’s. He might be slightly taller, but not much taller.</p>
<p>From its appearance, it was actually a human.</p>
<p>It’s impossible for it to be a human. Why would a human sleep in such a place? As Zhou Wen was pondering, the person pulled back his hair with both hands, revealing his face.</p>
<p>The moment he saw the face, Zhou Wen was so surprised that he nearly escaped the mask’s control. This was because the face looked identical to Lance’s.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to observe his figure again and realized that his figure was identical to Lance’s. It was as though he was carved from the same mold.</p>
<p>However, he was thinner than Lance and looked a little malnourished.</p>
<p>He can’t be Lance, so who is he? Zhou Wen was very sure that he wasn’t Lance because Lance was just like him, standing there in a daze.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1024'>Chapter 1024: Masked Man</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>After the person came out of the grave, he looked no different from a living person. With Truth Listener’s ability, it was impossible to tell if he was human.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The tombstone shattered. The mask embedded in the tombstone floated up and floated in front of the man.</p>
<p>The man glanced at the mask and muttered to himself, “Is it finally starting again?”</p>
<p>With that said, he picked up the mask and slowly placed it on his face. The strange mask stuck to his face as though it had fused with it.</p>
<p>It didn’t look like he was wearing a mask. Instead, it looked like the mask had grown on his face. It was an extremely strange feeling.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>After the man put on the mask, Zhou Wen immediately felt his body regain its freedom. It was the same for Lance and the others.</p>
<p>“I’ll ask, and you answer. Now, you can speak. The rules here won’t kill you because you speak,” the masked man said calmly.</p>
<p>“Who… Who are you?” Lance stared at the masked man and asked.</p>
<p>Although he couldn’t move previously, he clearly had the ability to observe the masked man’s face. He was more puzzled than anyone else why the masked man’s appearance was identical to his.</p>
<p>The masked man didn’t answer his question and instead asked, “Are you a descendant of Frod?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. We are all Frod’s descendants. Who are you, Sir?” Gaiman asked the masked man.</p>
<p>“None of you are. Only he is.” The masked man slowly raised his hand and pointed at Lance with his index finger.</p>
<p>“Sir, what do you mean?” Lance stared intently at the masked man and asked.</p>
<p>“Frod has an agreement with me. He will give me his descendant, and you are his descendant,” the masked man said.</p>
<p>Although his words were odd, Zhou Wen believed them a little. This was because Lance shouldn’t have been part of this operation.</p>
<p>Lance had never contracted a Mythical Companion Beast before, and he had just been injured. Furthermore, with his special identity, he shouldn’t have come here to take the risk.</p>
<p>However, Frod had made Lance participate in this operation. For this, he had specially contracted a Mythical Companion Beast for him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that it was because Frod wanted to train Lance and give him more experience that he was allowed to carry out this mission.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it wasn’t that simple. Perhaps the masked man’s words were true.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? There’s no such thing. We are all Frod’s blood relatives. Even if he really has a deal with you, it shouldn’t be Lance.” Gaiman shielded Lance behind him, but his expression was somewhat odd.</p>
<p>Although Gaiman’s words were firm, he was just as suspicious as Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“No, you aren’t. The bloodline in you is only Frod’s bloodline as a human. That means nothing to me. Only he has the bloodline of the non-human Frod—the body I need,” the masked man said.</p>
<p>“Nonsense. He’s my grandson, and I’m Frod’s son. In terms of bloodline, I’m naturally closer to Frod. Who are you? Why are you making up these lies?” Gaiman summoned his Companion Beasts and gestured for Lance and company to retreat out of the garden.</p>
<p>“The bloodline I’m talking about might be a little different from what you understand, but it doesn’t matter. From the looks of it, Frod doesn’t plan on offering him to me,” the masked man said as his gaze shifted to Zhou Wen. “From the looks of it, he prepared a better body for me in order to redeem the one of his bloodline.”</p>
<p>When the masked man first spoke, Zhou Wen realized that he might have been scammed by Frod. Now that he heard the masked man say that, he no longer had any doubts. He had indeed been scammed.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Lance stared at the masked man and asked again.</p>
<p>The masked man answered unhurriedly, “I’m not a human. I’m a Guardian, the Guardian of the Maze of Lies.”</p>
<p>“How is that possible? You are a human. Besides, the Guardian of the Maze of Lies has already been killed.” Lance naturally didn’t believe it.</p>
<p>The mask on the masked man’s face was like a human’s face. He revealed a somewhat evil expression. “I only said that I’m the Guardian of the Maze of Lies, but I didn’t say that I’m the current Guardian.”</p>
<p>“You aren’t wrong to say that I’m human. This is because only by fusing with a human’s body can I obtain the possibility of growth in this world. However, contracting a human is too troublesome. I still need to take care of the weak human. I hate trouble, so I chose to fuse with a human’s body and wield everything at my control,” said the masked man.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood that the masked man was the opposite of Wang Mingyuan. Wang Mingyuan had fused a Guardian with his human body.</p>
<p>As for the masked man, he had absorbed a human with a Guardian’s body. The foundation was the same, but things were reversed.</p>
<p>“Are you a Guardian from the last Guardian battle?” Zhou Wen interjected.</p>
<p>“Sort of.” The masked man continued, “Although fusing with a human’s body allowed me to escape the restrictions of this world’s powers on aliens, I had no choice but to face another problem. A human’s body is different from a Guardian’s. A Guardian’s body won’t age, but a human’s body will age and die. I didn’t want to die, so I had to change my body before I aged. Therefore, I made an agreement with Frod. I helped him obtain what he wanted. And in return, he will offer a child of his bloodline to me for my new body. According to the agreement, you have finally arrived in front of me.”</p>
<p>With that said, the masked man’s gaze looked at Lance before landing on Zhou Wen, not moving it away again. “Frod has put in a lot of effort. His bloodline was originally the most suitable for me, but I never expected such a body to exist among humans. I’ll accept his painstaking effort. Go back and tell Frod that I’ll take this body. The agreement between us is over.”</p>
<p>Lance, who was retreating, stopped when he heard that. He stared at the masked man and said, “Ignoring the fact I don’t believe such a thing exists, even if it does, this matter has nothing to do with others. This is an agreement between you and our family. Don’t implicate others.”</p>
<p>The masked man laughed when he heard that. “Are you going to destroy Frod’s hard work? In order to save you, he invited so many people in, hoping that I would choose another body. This is your only chance of survival. If I don’t choose him, you will definitely die.”</p>
<p>“Lance, let’s go.” Gaiman pulled Lance back.</p>
<p>However, Lance suddenly summoned his Companion Beast. Wearing his Companion Beast armor, he threw a punch at the masked man. “Then give it a try and see if you can snatch my body.”</p>
<p>Gaiman was alarmed. It was too late to stop him, so he could only cooperate with Lance in an attack.</p>
<p>Gemar and the other two members of the Ultimate Family Clan also attacked. Their Mythical Companion Beasts mostly had freezing abilities. All sorts of freezing beams blasted at the masked man.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1025'>Chapter 1025: Clue</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>However, the freezing beams passed through the man’s body as though his body was an illusion. They didn’t do a thing.</p>
<p>“It’s useless. Your strength is too weak. You don’t have the right to touch me.” The masked man watched as Lance’s fist and person passed through his body. He stood there and continued, “If it wasn’t because this body is too old, you wouldn’t even have the right to see me.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, the masked man’s eyes focused. Just like before, Lance, Gaiman, and company immediately recovered their dazed states and were completely unable to move.</p>
<p>“Seeing that Frod did a good job, I’ll forgive your rudeness this time, but don’t do it again.” After the masked man said that, Lance and company immediately regained their freedom.</p>
<p>“This is your deal with our family. If you want a body, take mine. Don’t implicate others,” said Lance.</p>
<p>“Lance…” Gaiman wanted to drag Lance away, but Lance dodged him.</p>
<p>“Are you really willing to let me take away your body? Do you know that although your body can continue living, your consciousness will be completely wiped away? I don’t need your consciousness,” the masked man asked Lance with interest.</p>
<p>“I’ll settle my own matters. There’s no need for others to replace me. It won’t be that easy for you to occupy my body,” Lance said calmly.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, humans nowadays seem to have more backbone than before. Unfortunately, I’ve already changed my mind. I want his body, and your body is already useless to me. I won’t change my mind. It’s up to you whether you leave or stay, but I want his body,” the masked man said as he looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I didn’t know this would happen,” Lance said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. It’s not your fault.” Zhou Wen shook his head slightly.</p>
<p>He was already used to being in the middle of a conspiracy. If a person didn’t have any wealth, even if he appeared in front of an evil person, the evil person wouldn’t scheme against him. That was because there was no profit to be had.</p>
<p>However, if a person had a huge treasure, no matter how far they hid, there would still be people targeting them. This was probably the reason why it was said that a man’s wealth was his own ruin.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen’s abilities became stronger, no matter how much he restrained himself, people would still target him. It was inevitable.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen could accept it, but it didn’t mean that he would forgive Frod.</p>
<p>“Since my life should have ended here, I’ll still stay behind. Even if we really go to hell, we probably won’t be lonely,” said Lance.</p>
<p>“I don’t care if you want to go to hell, but I haven’t lived enough. I still want to live a few more years.” As Zhou Wen spoke, his figure suddenly vanished. He used teleportation and headed for the exit of the garden.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen soon realized that the garden’s door had vanished. There was nothing beyond the garden. There was no way out.</p>
<p>“Only people with my permission can walk out of here,” the masked man said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Then, can I leave after killing you?” Zhou Wen asked bluntly.</p>
<p>The masked man laughed. “Of course, you can kill me and leave this place. Unfortunately, even the strongest human is as insignificant as an ant in front of me.”</p>
<p>“How would I know if I don’t try?” Zhou Wen continued pulling out the Bamboo Blade.</p>
<p>“I’ll fight with you,” Lance said as he leaned over.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll attack the top while you attack the bottom,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Lance rushed over.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was behind him, but he struck the back of Lance’s head, knocking him unconscious.</p>
<p>“Take him back. Don’t get in the way here.” Zhou Wen carried Lance and threw him at Gaiman.</p>
<p>Gaiman hurriedly caught Lance and looked at Zhou Wen with a complicated expression. “Our family has let you down. I never expected you… Tell me whatever wish you have. As long as I can do it, I’ll definitely help you.”</p>
<p>Gaiman didn’t know, but no matter who it was, it would be impossible for them to be as carefree as Zhou Wen. He had even taken Lance into consideration and wanted to send him out.</p>
<p>“Don’t thank me. I’m a person who distinguishes kindness and hatred clearly. This matter has nothing to do with Lance. He doesn’t need to die with me, but go back and tell Frod that I’ll definitely take back what he owes me,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Gaiman didn’t say anything else as he bowed deeply at Zhou Wen before leaving the garden with Lance.</p>
<p>From his point of view, it was impossible for Zhou Wen to leave alive. In front of the masked man who was as invincible as a god, they didn’t even have the ability to resist. All that awaited them was death.</p>
<p>I wonder if Demonic Neonate is a match for the masked man? However, at this point in time, I can only give it a try. However, I don’t think there’s a big problem. I can’t even see Demonic Neonate’s Terror form, but I can at least see this masked man. Zhou Wen closed his eyes, preventing his gaze from coming into contact with the mask, hoping to prevent his body from being unable to move.</p>
<p>“It’s useless to close your eyes. The influence of this mask doesn’t target your eyes, but your soul,” the masked man said with interest.</p>
<p>He looked at Zhou Wen as though he was looking at a new car or house. He was filled with curiosity, but he didn’t treat Zhou Wen as a person.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen still didn’t open his eyes and after some thought he said, “Can I ask you a few questions?”</p>
<p>“On account that you are about to donate your body to me, I can try my best to answer you.” The masked man wasn’t in a rush to take action, as though he was waiting for something.</p>
<p>“You participated in the last Guardian battle. Then, can you tell me what the Guardians are looking for?” Zhou Wen wanted to take the opportunity to pry into some secrets.</p>
<p>Many powerful creatures in the dimension wanted something from Earth, but up to now, Zhou Wen still didn’t know what they wanted.</p>
<p>“If you ask the other Guardians this question, even if you ask 99 of them, I’m afraid none of them will know. However, you are asking the right Guardian by asking me. I’m the only Guardian among a hundred who knows.” The masked man’s answer delighted Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Zhou Wen pressed.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what it is,” the masked man answered.</p>
<p>The corners of Zhou Wen’s eyes twitched as he had the urge to slap him.</p>
<p>The masked man seemed to appreciate Zhou Wen’s expression as he said with a faint smile, “Of course I wouldn’t know. This is because even the big shots of the dimensional races don’t know what they are looking for. However, there’s a clue. There aren’t many Guardians who know this clue, and I’m one of them.”</p>
<p>“What clue?” Zhou Wen pressed.</p>
<p>“Companion Beast, the strongest Companion Beast,” said the masked man.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1026'>Chapter 1026: Time’s Up</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Companion Beasts? Aren’t dimensional creatures unable to use Companion Beasts? Why do they need them?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>“Who told you that dimensional creatures can’t use Companion Beasts?” The masked man curled his lips and said, “They just can’t use Earth’s Companion Beasts. In dimensional zones, there are many powerful Companion Beasts, but they are just a little different from Earth’s Companion Beasts. Furthermore, they are far stronger than Earth’s Companion Beasts.”</p>
<p>“Since dimensional Companion Beasts are stronger than Earth’s Companion Beasts, why are they searching for a Companion Beast on Earth?” Zhou Wen was even more puzzled.</p>
<p>“This world is unique so no dimensional creature can understand it.” The masked man pondered for a moment before continuing, “In any dimension, creating something out of nothing is impossible. Even in theory, it’s impossible to do such a thing. However, humans have done it on Earth.”</p>
<p>“Humans can create something out of nothing? Why don’t I know?” Zhou Wen thought for a moment. There didn’t seem to be such powerful technology on Earth.</p>
<p>“Yes, every human can do it.” The masked man smiled at Zhou Wen. “You can do it too.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Zhou Wen still couldn’t figure out how he could make something out of nothing.</p>
<p>The masked man raised a hand and pressed it against his head with his finger. “It’s the imagination of the brain. In the dimension, there’s no such thing as ghosts and gods. Only Earth has those imaginary entities. Isn’t that creating something out of nothing? What’s even stranger is that the ghosts and gods in human imagination can actually result in the appearance of the corresponding creatures in the dimension. It is a mystery that has yet to be explained.”</p>
<p>“The saying of ghosts and gods originated from humans’ fear of nature. It’s just that humans have a richer imagination. Perhaps it doesn’t mean anything. Or perhaps, it’s the dimensional creatures that descended to Earth in the past. Humans saw them and treated them as ghosts and gods, so they had their legends. It’s not strange to find the corresponding creatures in a dimension,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“No, that’s not the case. In fact, you don’t know that outside this world, there’s another area between this world and the dimension. That area gives birth to many dimensional creatures. The dimensional creatures in Earth’s dimensional zones come from there, not from the dimension.”</p>
<p>The masked man continued, “What’s even stranger is that some powerful dimensional creatures once spent a lot of energy and effort to study the region where dimensional creatures were born. They discovered something very strange.”</p>
<p>“What was that?” Zhou Wen naturally knew of such a place. Not only did he know about it, but he had also been there.</p>
<p>“The dimensional creatures born there are highly compatible with the creatures you humans imagine. Furthermore, the dimensional creatures that originally didn’t exist there were actually born there after you humans used your imagination to create them.”</p>
<p>“How are you sure that dimensional creatures were born after humans used their imagination to create them? Perhaps humans have long imagined them, but you didn’t discover them in the past.” Zhou Wen attempted an analysis.</p>
<p>“This isn’t difficult to prove. This is because a thousand years ago, humans didn’t have firearms, and the dimensional creatures born in that area didn’t have firearms. When something like a pistol appeared among you humans, dimensional creatures were actually produced that wielded pistol-like weapons. Although there were very few of them and they were very rare, this is a concrete fact.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if there are many instances of this in the modern world, but before I fell asleep, such a situation had already happened.” The masked man continued, “There are still many strange things about Earth. For example, even powerful existences at the Apocalypse grade will have their strength weakened to the level of ordinary Mythical creatures when they descend upon this world. Another example is that only human bodies can break through to a level above the Terror grade in this world. These are all very unscientific. In theory, this world is a low-level world relative to the dimension. Low-level creatures have no way of limiting high-level creatures. Even if they can’t withstand the descent of high-level creatures, they can only be destroyed by high-level forces, not restrict high-level creatures. However, until I fell asleep, no expert has been able to break the rules of this world. What does that say?”</p>
<p>“It means that Earth isn’t a low-level world? It could be higher than the dimension?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“That’s right. The dimensional experts also had such considerations, but if this world is a high-level world, there will definitely be high-level lifeforms. However, there aren’t such lifeforms on Earth. And other than Earth, there aren’t any lifeforms on other planets. Therefore, those big shots want to find the answer.” The masked man revealed a strange smile.</p>
<p>The smile sent a chill down Zhou Wen’s spine as he had an ominous feeling.</p>
<p>“Have they found the answer?” Zhou Wen asked nervously.</p>
<p>“Almost. According to their speculations, this world might give birth to a very powerful Companion Beast. As for you humans and the other dimensional creatures, you are just companion creatures of that Companion Beast,” the masked man said with a smile.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen heard that, he frowned and asked, “Why would it be giving birth to a Companion Beast instead of a dimensional creatures”</p>
<p>“I don’t know about that. You have to ask the big shots of the dimension. These ideas were speculated by them. Furthermore, they guessed that once the Companion Beast appeared, this world would be destroyed,” the masked man continued.</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen was even more puzzled.</p>
<p>“I don’t know either, because I only heard the news, but didn’t know their inference process. However, this matter has already reached the consensus of the various races in the dimension. They are vying for control of this place because they want to find that Companion Beast and take it for themselves. Once that Companion Beast is found, this world will be doomed.” The masked man looked up into the sky and said, “Times up. You should be on your way. I hope you had a good time before you died. After all, I don’t wish for this body I’m using to have any unpleasant memories.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean time’s up?” Zhou Wen asked the masked man.</p>
<p>“Time of death.” The masked man didn’t look at Zhou Wen. He continued looking up at the sky at a 45-degree angle, waiting for the moment Zhou Wen died.</p>
<p>However, as time ticked by, Zhou Wen remained standing there without any changes. He didn’t show any signs of dying. As for the masked man, his neck seemed to ache as his expression stiffened.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1027'>Chapter 1027: Battle of Terror Creatures</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen knew what the masked man meant when he said the time was up. He had already been in the garden for an hour. Under normal circumstances, he would have been killed by the garden’s one-hour time limit.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen didn’t know how he would die in reality, the masked man only wanted his body. A complete corpse was most suitable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen had the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, so the time limit here couldn’t kill him.</p>
<p>The masked man looked cool by looking up at the sky at a 45-degree angle, but after a while, he couldn’t maintain it.</p>
<p>“You actually have the ability to restrain taboo powers. How surprising. This is a very rare attribute. I’m increasingly satisfied with your body,” the masked man said.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your affirmation of my body, but I’m sorry. I also find this body pretty good. I have no intention of giving it away.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he suddenly summoned the Invisibility Cloak and put it on. At the same time, he released the ice maiden in the Chaos Bead.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate was also summoned by Zhou Wen. He hugged her and quickly retreated.</p>
<p>As he had to maintain the Heaven-Opening Scripture state to prevent himself from being killed by the taboo powers here, Zhou Wen couldn’t teleport.</p>
<p>The ice maiden had been trapped in the Chaos Bead for days. She was already gnashing her teeth in hatred. Now that she was suddenly released, she immediately felt a strange force descend on her, oppressing her body and strength.</p>
<p>Sweeping her gaze, the ice maiden immediately understood something. She summoned the ice castle and used its power to provide herself protection, preventing her Terror-grade powers from being directly weakened by Earth.</p>
<p>The ice castle fell and immediately smashed the garden.</p>
<p>When the masked man saw Zhou Wen suddenly vanish only to have the ice maiden and the ice castle instantly appear and flatten the garden, he imagined that the ice maiden was Zhou Wen’s helper.</p>
<p>The masked man’s eyes turned cold. The eye sockets of the mask seemed to have a strange magical power that attracted the ice maiden’s soul.</p>
<p>The ice maiden’s gaze involuntarily looked into the masked man’s eyes. However, she knew that this wasn’t her wish.</p>
<p>The ice maiden was alarmed as well. She imagined that the masked man had been sent by Zhou Wen to kill her, so she immediately entered her Terror form. Her entire body turned into an ice crystal as a terrifying cold wave emitted from her. Instantly, the entire garden turned into a world of ice and snow, freezing the masked man in ice.</p>
<p>“How dare you show off your ice-elemental Terror powers in front of me?” The masked man’s cold voice sounded from the ice. Cracks appeared on the ice as it quickly shattered.</p>
<p>In the next moment, the masked man’s figure vanished.</p>
<p>The ice maiden immediately erected an ice barrier to protect her body. As for the terrifying invisible blades, they crisscrossed and slashed at the ice barrier, quickly shattering it.</p>
<p>The masked man’s mask kept appearing in her mind, making her have the desire to look at it.</p>
<p>The ice maiden was alarmed. The masked man’s strength was terrifying, exceeding her expectations. She never expected Zhou Wen to find such a terrifying figure to deal with her.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, the ice maiden took out the Heaven Shrouding Bell from the ice castle and shook it in her hand.</p>
<p>The hidden masked man revealed himself due to the Heaven Shrouding Bell’s sound. He staggered a few steps and revealed a solemn expression.</p>
<p>A strange gray light suffused the mask, making his face look even more ferocious.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t rush out of the garden and could only hide far away. However, the Invisibility Cloak only had three minutes. After three minutes, the masked man and the ice maiden would be able to find him.</p>
<p>“Little Neonate, find an opportunity to kill that fellow with the mask now.” Zhou Wen used his mind to communicate with Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate remained motionless in his arms. She also felt that the masked man wasn’t easy to deal with, so she had to wait for an opportunity.</p>
<p>During the ice maiden and the masked man’s fight, the Heaven Shrouding Bell and the mask emitted strange powers. Zhou Wen only saw flashes of light, preventing him from seeing their battle clearly.</p>
<p>This situation was similar to the situation after Zhou Wen entered the dimension. He could only use Truth Listener and could vaguely hear the battle situation.</p>
<p>The Heaven Shrouding Bell was very powerful, but the ice maiden’s strength seemed to be lacking. After shaking the Heaven Shrouding Bell twice and failing to kill the masked man, her strength began to weaken.</p>
<p>As for the masked man’s strength, it showed no signs of weakening.</p>
<p>Is the masked man that strong? Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>He originally imagined that the ice maiden was a dimensional creature and should be sufficiently powerful. He never expected her to fail to suppress the masked man with the Heaven Shrouding Bell.</p>
<p>“Although the Heaven Shrouding Bell is very strong, you are too weak. You are unable to truly use its might. It’s best you give it to me and I’ll spare your life.” The masked man actually had the intention of snatching the Heaven Shrouding Bell.</p>
<p>The gray light on the mask intensified as though there was an endless abyss in its eye sockets.</p>
<p>The ice maiden’s mind was gradually attracted by it. She could barely restrain her desire to look at the mask.</p>
<p>The ice maiden clearly saw that the masked man had the bloodline of a human and a Guardian as she said coldly, “How dare a hybrid scum have designs on the Heaven Shrouding Bell?”</p>
<p>“As an ice demon, you might not have any noble bloodline. At the very least, my strength is above yours. If I want you to live, you will live. If I want you to die, you will die.” The masked man swam through the world of ice like a phantom. When the ice maiden’s frost power struck him, it only hit an illusion.</p>
<p>The ice maiden’s eyes became less and less resolute.</p>
<p>“If you hand over the Heaven Shrouding Bell now, you still have a chance of survival.” The masked man’s figure appeared on the ice surface as though he had appeared in a mirror.</p>
<p>The ice maiden’s gaze began to uncontrollably look at the masked man’s figure on the ice surface. Her frost powers also began to weaken.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden is not going to make it… Zhou Wen couldn’t help but worry when he saw that Demonic Neonate hadn’t taken action. This was because his three minutes of invisibility was almost up.</p>
<p>At that moment, an ice beam erupted from the ice maiden’s body. An ice crystal crown formed above her head. Her figure became increasingly transparent, almost invisible.</p>
<p>At the same time, the ice maiden shook the Heaven Shrouding Bell in her hand.</p>
<p>“Ice Demon Monarch’s bloodline?” The masked man wore a look of surprise. Just as he finished speaking, everything in the garden was shattered by the Heaven Shrouding Bell’s power.</p>
<p>The masked man, who was the first to bear the brunt of the impact, slid backward in the garden before slamming into the garden’s wall. The wall collapsed and he was buried inside.</p>
<p>After this strike, the ice maiden’s body immediately entered a weakened state. She was unable to maintain her Terror form and she returned to her normal appearance.</p>
<p>However, there was no joy on the ice maiden’s face. The masked man slowly stood up amidst the rubble of the collapsed wall.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1028'>Chapter 1028: Ice Maiden’s Disbelief</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The masked man’s face looked intact, but his clothes were tattered like a beggar’s.</p>
<p>However, from the torn parts of his clothes, one could see that his skin was crystalline like jade. There were some strange red spots that quickly vanished.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, my body has really aged. If I were at my peak, such strength wouldn’t even be able to damage my clothes. I actually suffered injuries. A human’s body is indeed too weak…” The masked man walked out step by step. The mask on his face seemed to be enveloped by a mysterious fog as it emitted a terrifying aura.</p>
<p>He was like a devil that had walked out of hell. Even the ice maiden’s expression changed.</p>
<p>The ice maiden stared at the masked man and asked through gritted teeth, “You have an S-grade Terror form?”</p>
<p>“As expected of the Ice Demon Monarch’s descendant. You do have some keen eyesight. If it wasn’t for my body being too old, your strength wouldn’t have been able to injure me,” the masked man said indifferently, but he still walked towards the ice maiden step by step. The closer he was to the ice maiden, the more her eyes couldn’t leave the mask.</p>
<p>“Ice Maiden, give me the Heaven Shrouding Bell.” Zhou Wen suddenly appeared not far from the ice maiden. Three minutes of invisibility had passed, and he couldn’t hide his body any longer.</p>
<p>When the ice maiden heard Zhou Wen’s voice, the hate for him exceeded the influence the mask had on her. She subconsciously turned to look at Zhou Wen and raised the Heaven Shrouding Bell in her hand.</p>
<p>She meant to use the Heaven Shrouding Bell against Zhou Wen, but in the masked man’s eyes, it was as though she was obediently giving the Heaven Shrouding Bell to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The masked man instantly arrived in front of the ice maiden and reached out to grab the Heaven Shrouding Bell. Before the ice maiden could react, he had already grabbed the Heaven Shrouding Bell.</p>
<p>The ice maiden wanted to resist, but her strength was ultimately inferior to the masked man. The masked man forcefully snatched away the Heaven Shrouding Bell.</p>
<p>At the instant the masked man succeeded, his expression changed drastically. In her Terror form, Demonic Neonate had appeared above him with the demonic sword in hand. It slashed at the mask.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The mask was split apart by the demonic sword, leaving a crack in the middle.</p>
<p>Pfft!</p>
<p>Blood spewed out of the masked man’s mouth as he was sent flying. The Heaven Shrouding Bell he had just snatched was snatched back by Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate held the Heaven Shrouding Bell in one hand and the demonic sword in the other as she charged at the masked man.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t see her figure at all, but he could see the mask on the masked man’s face being slashed open. It was about to shatter.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The mask finally couldn’t withstand the terrifying destructive force and shattered into pieces. The masked man’s face, that was extremely similar to Lance, was revealed again.</p>
<p>However, his face was devoid of color. Instead, blood spewed out of his mouth as his body rapidly aged. In the blink of an eye, he went from a young man to a middle-aged man. Then, the wrinkles on his body increased. Soon, he became an old man.</p>
<p>“Companion Beast… A Terror-grade Companion Beast… How is this possible…” The masked man’s body slammed into the wall, creating a dent. His body sank in, but his eyes were filled with disbelief as he looked at Demonic Neonate, who had stabbed her sword into his glabella. It was as though he had seen a ghost.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, you have no use for my body. Do you have anything to say before you die? If you have any unfulfilled wishes and it’s not too troublesome, I don’t mind helping you,” Zhou Wen said to the masked man from afar.</p>
<p>Although the mask had been shattered and the demonic sword had stabbed into his skull, the masked man didn’t die immediately. Zhou Wen didn’t dare approach him to prevent himself from suffering a counterattack.</p>
<p>The masked man didn’t move, but the ice maiden suddenly moved. With a terrifying ice beam, she struck Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, just as she moved, a huge creature rushed out from the calabash in Zhou Wen’s hand. Seven strange dragon-like tentacles spewed out white liquid that blocked the ice maiden’s ice beam. At the same time, it wrapped around her body.</p>
<p>Another Terror-grade! The ice maiden was already speechless from shock.</p>
<p>She already understood that she had been tricked by Zhou Wen and had helped him fight. However, while Demonic Neonate was dealing with the masked man, she believed that it wouldn’t be difficult to kill Zhou Wen with all her remaining strength.</p>
<p>However, she never expected Zhou Wen to have another Terror-grade creature on him.</p>
<p>Originally, the Seven Seas Dragon King wasn’t the ice maiden’s match. Furthermore, the ice element was more effective against the Seven Seas Dragon King. However, the ice maiden had expended too much of her strength, leaving her with less than thirty percent of her combat strength. She was no match for the Seven Seas Dragon King.</p>
<p>Is this really Earth? The ice maiden found it unbelievable. A human actually had a Terror-grade Companion Beast and had a Terror-grade creature loyal to him. It was unimaginable.</p>
<p>Seeing that the ice maiden was restrained, her body was entangled by the Seven Seas Dragon King’s tentacles and that she was covered in the white liquid, Zhou Wen finally heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>However, the masked man suddenly laughed strangely. As he laughed, he said crazily, “Interesting. It’s really interesting. A mere human actually has a Terror-grade Companion Beast. Furthermore, he can order a Terror creature to do things. This is really interesting. Only such a body is worthy of me, the Bizarre God. I want your body.”</p>
<p>“Are you dreaming?” As Zhou Wen spoke, he ordered Demonic Neonate to quickly kill the masked man.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate pulled out the demonic sword mercilessly as blood and brain matter spewed out from the masked man’s head.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Demonic Neonate brandished her sword again and cleaved open Bizarre God’s head. As for the Grim Demon in the demon sword, he rushed out and opened his mouth in excitement, swallowing Bizarre God’s corpse. With a few chomps, it swallowed everything.</p>
<p>After swallowing Bizarre God’s corpse, the demonic aura on Grim Demon’s body surged. It looked like he was about to evolve.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate waved her hand and Grim Demon returned to the demonic sword. The demonic sword automatically returned to its scabbard and returned to her hand.</p>
<p>That’s a… Guardian… A Companion Beast’s Guardian… The ice maiden was already dumbfounded. She couldn’t believe what she had seen today and felt like she was dreaming.</p>
<p>An Epic human had a Terror-grade Companion Beasts; yet, this Companion Beast actually had a Guardian. What was this? It was like a fantasy story.</p>
<p>Even in her dreams, the ice maiden had never imagined that something like this would happen.</p>
<p>Is this fellow really human? The ice maiden had already given up struggling and looked at Zhou Wen in a daze. However, no matter how she looked at it, Zhou Wen was only an Epic human.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1029'>Chapter 1029: Day of the Reborn</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Deep underground in Frost City, a white-haired man with a white beard walked out of the ice cavern.</p>
<p>“I’ve finally had the agreement annulled!” Frod was so excited that he almost roared at the sky.</p>
<p>Although he had obtained what he wanted from the deal with the Bizarre God, he still fell for a trap in the end. His body fused with the ice, turning him into an undead iceman.</p>
<p>Now that Bizarre God had obtained the body he wanted, the agreement was finally completed. Frod had finally regained his freedom.</p>
<p>Suppressing his excitement, Frod walked out of the ice cave immediately. The moment he saw the sky and the sun, he narrowed his eyes. The long-awaited sun made him so excited that he almost cried.</p>
<p>“How many years has it been… How many years has it been… I’m finally back… I, Frod… can finally stand at the peak of the earth again…” Frod suppressed the excitement in his heart and muttered to himself with a trembling voice.</p>
<p>“Father… You… You…” Gaiman couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw Frod.</p>
<p>Gaiman had rushed back to Frost City with his men because he wanted to ask Frod about the things he had heard as soon as possible. However, now that he saw Frod had returned to his human form and walked out of the ice cavern, there was no need for further questions. It was obvious that the masked man was right.</p>
<p>“Gaiman, where’s Lance? Has he returned?” Frod immediately grabbed Gaiman’s arm and asked.</p>
<p>“He’s back… That masked man chose Zhou Wen…” Gaiman said with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>He was naturally happy that Lance hadn’t died, but Zhou Wen had sacrificed himself as the price. Gaiman wanted to be happy, but he couldn’t. Frod’s actions were at odds with his beliefs.</p>
<p>“I knew it. I knew that the fellow would choose Zhou Wen. That’s good. That’s good. Lance is safe, and I’ve regained my freedom. This is a joyous occasion for our family. Prepare the alcohol. I want to drink…” Frod was even more excited.</p>
<p>Gaiman thought for a moment and sighed. “Father, Zhou Wen said that he’s a person who distinguishes kindness and hatred clearly. He will come for you.”</p>
<p>Frod laughed. “Come for me? I’m afraid it’s going to be in his next life. He has no idea how terrifying that Bizarre God is. Even the most top-notch humans are like ants in front of Bizarre God. Bizarre God only needs a mere thought to kill as many people as he wants. Although Zhou Wen is indeed very strong, he’s still far from that level. Or rather, it’s a power that humans can’t reach.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s not talk about this anymore. Go prepare the alcohol. It’s been so many years since I’ve tasted alcohol. Now that I’ve finally recovered my human form and saved Lance, I have to celebrate today.” When Frod thought of the fragrance of the alcohol, he felt a little light-headed as his saliva kept secreting.</p>
<p>After he became an iceman, he no longer had any sense of taste, nor could he eat. Furthermore, he was trapped in the ice cavern. His range of movement was limited to the ice cavern.</p>
<p>Although his family would occasionally visit him, the feeling was still unbearable. It almost drove him crazy.</p>
<p>Frod was an alcoholic. After enduring so many years without alcohol, he only wanted to drink to his heart’s content.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Wen, he wasn’t part of his considerations. After all, Zhou Wen wasn’t his descendant. It didn’t matter if he died.</p>
<p>Gaiman sighed inwardly and didn’t say anything else. He went to prepare food and drinks for Frod. After all, it was indeed a good thing for the Ultimate Family Clan that Frod had been revived.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen… What a pity… Gaiman shook his head inwardly.</p>
<p>Under those circumstances, Gaiman felt it was a blessing for Lance to have a friend in Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen had saved Lance.</p>
<p>Gaiman ordered people to prepare the best dishes and alcohol for Frod. At the same time, he arranged for the core members of his family to meet him.</p>
<p>As the news of Frod’s revival still needed to be kept secret, he couldn’t tell all the members of the Ultimate Family Clan. He only wanted a few core members to know about it.</p>
<p>Frod sat in front of the table and watched as all sorts of roasted meat and fish were served. His gastric juices were secreted crazily, almost melting his entire stomach.</p>
<p>“Where’s the alcohol? I want alcohol. Quickly bring it over,” shouted Frod.</p>
<p>“Coming.” Gaiman took out the hard liquor he had kept.</p>
<p>“That’s the smell. That’s the smell. How many years has it been? I can finally drink again.” Frod took the alcohol and immediately opened it to smell it. Even without drinking it, the smell of the alcohol made him so happy that he almost felt inebriated.</p>
<p>“Where’s Lance? Why don’t I see him?” Just as Frod was about to drink, he suddenly thought of Lance. Lance was the descendant he valued the most. It was only right for him to be present at such a joyous occasion.</p>
<p>“Lance was slightly injured and is resting.” Gaiman didn’t mention that Lance wasn’t willing to leave and wanted to pay back Zhou Wen with his life.</p>
<p>It was rare for Frod to be so happy. Furthermore, Zhou Wen was already dead. It was only a matter of time before Lance got over it. There was no need to make Frod unhappy.</p>
<p>“Are his injuries serious?” Frod asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. He’ll be fine after resting for half a day,” Gaiman said.</p>
<p>“That’s good.” Frod was already starving when he smelled the fragrance of the roasted meat and alcohol. He couldn’t wait any longer. Without any hesitation, he held the bottle and couldn’t wait to pour it out. He immediately wanted to drink it.</p>
<p>“Today will be the day I, Frod, am reborn…” Frod was overjoyed, but he suddenly felt the bottle in his hand being pulled away by a huge force. It left his palm open, and he didn’t even taste a drop of alcohol.</p>
<p>“Who is it?” Frod was extremely furious. He slammed his palm on the table and glared over.</p>
<p>However, when he looked over, his eyes widened and his pupils constricted. His body suddenly trembled.</p>
<p>Gaiman and company also turned their heads. With a glance, Gaiman exclaimed, “Zhou Wen… You… You aren’t dead…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the bottle in Frod’s hand as he stood in front of the door with a calm expression.</p>
<p>“Bizarre God… You are Bizarre God, right? From the looks of it, you have been reborn. Congratulations…” Frod stood up and changed to a smile as he bowed at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>He naturally believed that Zhou Wen’s body had been occupied by Bizarre God.</p>
<p>Only then did Gaiman come to a realization. He carefully sized up Zhou Wen and thought to himself that it was a pity.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t look at the respectful Frod. He looked at Gaiman and said, “Did you deliver the message I asked you to deliver to Frod?”</p>
<p>“I’ve already conveyed your words to Father. The agreement between you and him has been completed…” Gaiman said.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t what I said,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That was what you wanted me to…” Gaiman was about to say something when a thought suddenly flashed through his mind. Although he couldn’t believe that such a thing would happen and believed that it was a delusion, he couldn’t help but have one thought when he looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1030'>Chapter 1030: Frozen Period</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Bizarre God, if you have anything to say, you can tell me directly now. There’s no need to go through another person.” Although Frod felt that Bizarre God was somewhat odd and had some doubts, he never expected that Bizarre God hadn’t obtained Zhou Wen’s body. The person who had returned was the real Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Frod wasn’t sinister and cunning, but that he understood the power of Bizarre God too well. He had long formed the belief that Bizarre God was invincible, making it difficult for him to immediately accept anything else.</p>
<p>“Mr. Gaiman, did you pass on my message to him?” Zhou Wen ignored him and continued speaking to Gaiman.</p>
<p>When Gaiman heard Zhou Wen’s tone, he was even more certain of his guess. His voice trembled as he looked at Zhou Wen and said, “You… You are Zhou Wen…”</p>
<p>Frod jolted when he heard Gaiman’s words. Before this, he had never thought of such a possibility, but Zhou Wen’s tone and demeanor seemed to be different from the Bizarre God he knew.</p>
<p>Impossible. How can a human defeat Bizarre God? It’s useless no matter how many Mythical Companion Beasts one has. It’s impossible for humans to win… Frod couldn’t accept such a possibility deep down.</p>
<p>“If I’m not Zhou Wen, who else can I be?” Zhou Wen said calmly.</p>
<p>Everyone was alarmed when they heard that. Frod’s body trembled as he looked at Zhou Wen with a strange look.</p>
<p>“How did you escape?” Frod asked Zhou Wen in surprise. He naturally refused to believe that Zhou Wen could defeat Bizarre God. He only believed that Zhou Wen had used some strange ability to luckily escape the maze.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen continued ignoring Frod. He looked at Gaiman and continued asking, “Did you give him the message I asked you to pass on?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Gaiman answered with a strange expression.</p>
<p>“That’s good.” Zhou Wen nodded and looked straight at Frod. “Frod, since you’ve received the message, I don’t need to say anything else. Do you want to end it yourself, or do you want me to do it?”</p>
<p>Frod’s expression darkened as he stared at Zhou Wen and said, “I did let you down regarding this matter, but since you escaped, I can give you some compensation to end this.”</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, you want me to do it?” Zhou Wen said to Frod.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, this is the Ultimate Family Clan. There’s no benefit in fighting me here. You didn’t suffer any losses anyway. I can give you a Mythical Companion Egg as compensation. Let’s end this matter. This will be beneficial to both you and me,” Frod said indifferently.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pondered and didn’t say a word. Frod thought that he was already tempted and continued, “You don’t need to pay any price to obtain a Mythical Companion Beast and my friendship. This will be of great help to you in the future…”</p>
<p>“Frod, you sold me out, and even your blood descendant, to Bizarre God to escape the ice cavern, right?” Zhou Wen suddenly interrupted Frod.</p>
<p>Frod’s expression turned somewhat nasty, but he still said, “Even if I didn’t send someone in, Bizarre God would still rush out of the maze when the time came. When that happened, it would only bring about an even greater disaster.”</p>
<p>“In other words, you used me to exchange for a chance to escape from the ice cavern and regain your freedom?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“What are you trying to get at?” Frod was getting impatient.</p>
<p>“I’m a very fair person. Since you used me to exchange for your freedom, I’ll take back what belongs to me and send you back into the ice cavern,” Zhou Wen said calmly.</p>
<p>“Who do you think you are? You are only a human, not Bizarre God. Apart from gods, no one can defeat me. Not even the Hero King from the past.” Frod found it difficult to control his emotions when he heard the words ‘ice cavern.’</p>
<p>He had endured the ice cavern for so many years before finally escaping and being restored to a normal person. He hadn’t even taken a sip of alcohol. He definitely wouldn’t return to such a place.</p>
<p>Frod knew that Zhou Wen was very strong. From his point of view, the fact that Zhou Wen could escape from Bizarre God was a terrifying testament to his abilities.</p>
<p>However, no matter how strong Zhou Wen was, he was only a human. He still had a limit. With his strength and the Ultimate Family Clan’s present heritage, there was no need for him to be afraid of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>He had even secretly decided that even if he had to pay a price, he would kill Zhou Wen here and eliminate this future threat.</p>
<p>“Ice Maiden.” Zhou Wen had no intention of wasting his breath on Frod. All he did was call out the ice maiden’s name.</p>
<p>At that moment, everyone realized that there was a beautiful young woman standing outside the door. Her face was as cold as ice, as though someone owed her a lot of money.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.” Ice Maiden walked in and bowed at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>In the Maze of Lies, Ice Maiden had been forced to sign an unfair contract with Zhou Wen. All she could do was obey his orders.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>“Throw him into ice, but don’t let him die. Don’t let him escape either. Furthermore, he has to have his consciousness maintained. Can you do it?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Ice Maiden answered with certainty.</p>
<p>“Then do it. He owes me. Don’t you agree, Mr. Gaiman?” Zhou Wen asked Gaiman.</p>
<p>Frod was already enraged. Zhou Wen had a powerful Companion Beast, so he didn’t dare underestimate him. It would have been fine if Zhou Wen were to do it himself, but now, Zhou Wen had actually made a servant do it. Furthermore, she was such a young woman. This wasn’t contempt, but an insult to him.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, I have been out of the limelight for too many years. The world has already forgotten how powerful the former hero of ice is,” Frod said before Gaiman could answer. At the same time, a terrifying ice aura erupted from his body. He summoned a frost dragon that prostrated under his feet. Its body suffused with an extremely terrifying ice aura.</p>
<p>The Frost Dragon was a top ice-type Mythical Companion Beast. It was perfectly compatible with Frod’s ice-elemental Essence Energy. With the mutual augmentation, their strength increased greatly.</p>
<p>“Back then, Bizarre God only turned me into an iceman by using a trick to trigger my own power of ice. It wasn’t his power of ice that surpassed mine. I want to see how you will seal me back into ice,” Frod said coldly.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden wasn’t in the mood to speak to Frod. She glanced at him and shot out an ice beam that instantly landed on Frod and the Frost Dragon.</p>
<p>In an instant, Frod and the Frost Dragon beneath him were frozen into ice sculptures.</p>
<p>The entire process was too fast. It was so fast that Gaiman and company had no time to react. They watched as Frod and the Frost Dragon turned into ice sculptures.</p>
<p>Even Frod himself remained standing there proudly, but his eyes were filled with boundless horror.</p>
<p>How is that possible? A top ice-elemental Mythical creature, Frost Dragon, was frozen into an ice sculpture? Gaiman and the other members of the Ultimate Family Clan knew how powerful the Frost Dragon was.</p>
<p>It wasn’t surprising if a Mythical creature defeated Frost Dragon, but to use the power of ice to freeze Frost Dragon was too terrifying.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1031'>Chapter 1031: Time to Collect the Debt</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Who is that woman? She actually has such terrifying ice powers. Could she be the legendary Goddess of Ice? Otherwise, how could she freeze a top ice-type Mythical Companion Beast like the Frost Dragon into an ice sculpture with a single glance… Such a woman is actually Zhou Wen’s subordinate… Father… What kind of person did you plot against… Gaiman’s heart was filled with bitterness. He wanted to save his father, but he was afraid of bringing disaster to the Ultimate Family Clan.</p>
<p>Even the Frost Dragon had been frozen into ice by the woman’s casual glance. If he angered Zhou Wen, Gaiman really didn’t know what the outcome would be. However, he knew very well that the outcome wasn’t something he could bear. Neither could the entire Ultimate Family Clan bear it.</p>
<p>The few core members of the Ultimate Family Clan present were dumbfounded. They were momentarily at a loss.</p>
<p>If they had reason on their side, they might have had the courage to fight to the death, but now, they couldn’t convince themselves.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the frozen Frod and asked Ice Maiden, “Is it possible for the ice to melt or shatter?”</p>
<p>“His body has already been frozen by me. If someone’s strength is stronger than mine, it’s possible to melt or shatter the ice. However, in that case, the person inside will also melt or shatter. As long as the ice isn’t destroyed, he won’t die,” Ice Maiden answered.</p>
<p>“Very good.” Zhou Wen was very satisfied with this answer. On Earth, it was very difficult to find a creature stronger than Ice Maiden.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if the person was stronger than Ice Maiden and could shatter the ice, that wasn’t sufficient to let Frod live.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, on account of Lance and Sadie…” Gaiman knew that it was impossible to use force, so he could only persuade Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“If it wasn’t for them, do you think he would be the only one in the ice?” Zhou Wen looked at Gaiman and cut him off.</p>
<p>Gaiman felt his heart turn cold. He couldn’t bring himself to say what he was about to say.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen poured the alcohol from the bottle in his hand in front of Frod’s ice sculpture and said indifferently, “Continue living the rest of your life in the ice. I hope you can live a little longer.”</p>
<p>With that said, Zhou Wen turned around and left. Ice Maiden followed behind him like a maid.</p>
<p>The top experts of the Ultimate Family Clan were here, but no one dared to stop Zhou Wen. All they could do was watch as they left.</p>
<p>No… Don’t leave! Let me out! I beg you, let me out… Bastard… Kill me if you have the guts… Don’t leave… I beg you… Let me out… I haven’t even taken a sip of the alcohol… Let me out… Frod roared and pleaded inwardly.</p>
<p>In the past, when he had been transformed into an ice statue, he could still move around in the ice cavern, but now, he couldn’t even blink. He was like a statue with a will. It was more torturous than killing him. He would rather die than live like this.</p>
<p>Kill me… Kill me… Frod was on the verge of madness, but no one could hear his thoughts.</p>
<p>Gaiman and the others had gathered all the experts in the Ultimate Family Clan who were proficient in ice-elemental powers. They wanted to dispel the ice, but no one was able to melt it.</p>
<p>How could they know that this was Terror-grade frost powers? Unless one reached the Terror-grade, even if they threw the ice into the flames, they wouldn’t be able to produce even a drop of water.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t meet Lance, Sadie, and company. He directly contacted Wang Lu, Feng Qiuyan, and Li Xuan and left Frost City with them.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had avenged himself, the other party was, after all, a relative of Lance and Sadie. If he were to meet them under such circumstances, it would only make both parties awkward. It was better not to meet them.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t know that a strange change was happening to the unconscious Lance.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>A strange force surged out of his brain, causing his body to undergo a strange change.</p>
<p>Bizarre God had previously said that only Lance had Frod’s bloodline. This was contradictory and complicated to begin with.</p>
<p>There were many people in the Ultimate Family Clan, and in fact, many of them were directly related to Frod. Lance wasn’t very special among them, and he was already three generations from Frod.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, in terms of purity, a first-generation descendant like Gaiman should be closest to Frod’s bloodline.</p>
<p>However, Bizarre God’s so-called Frod bloodline wasn’t determined by such ways. In fact, the human body that Bizarre God had fused with had belonged to Frod.</p>
<p>It just wasn’t the present Frod. Instead, it was a genetic replica created by Bizarre God using Frod’s genes and humanity’s gene technology.</p>
<p>Although he was a genetic clone, through some means of Bizarre God, the genetic clone’s body was even more perfect and outstanding than Frod’s.</p>
<p>However, such a genetic clone still couldn’t meet the requirements of Bizarre God. Therefore, he had done something to Frod and left something in him, waiting for the perfect human body that was truly suitable for him to be born into.</p>
<p>Lance was the perfect human body that Bizarre God had been waiting for. This was why he looked so similar to Bizarre God. Unfortunately, he had chosen Zhou Wen and abandoned his initial plan.</p>
<p>However, Bizarre God had left something behind in Lance’s body.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company headed for the East District. Now, Zhou Wen was roughly certain that he wouldn’t be able to evolve the Glimmer Life Soul simply by going to new places.</p>
<p>He planned on returning to buy some necessities for survival in space before teleporting to another planet. This might be the final condition for Glimmer to break through to the Perfect state.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen felt that it was likely the case. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be realistic for him to advance to a Perfect Body without using Glimmer’s interstellar teleportation ability.</p>
<p>After the dimensional storms, space technology had stopped advancing. Although many satellites were launched later, they were basically used for information transmission.</p>
<p>Humans had stopped exploring the universe. It had been a long time since humans had been able to land on the moon, much less Mars.</p>
<p>It wasn’t an easy task to obtain space equipment, but with Zhou Wen’s present strength, it wasn’t too difficult to obtain it.</p>
<p>After Wang Lu’s analysis, Zhou Wen decided to make a trip to the Special Investigation Bureau. It was time to collect some payment for the debt. He could also get some spaceflight equipment as interest on the debt.</p>
<p>According to Wang Lu, the Special Investigation Bureau had participated in quite a number of rocket launches. This was because satellites were basically unaffected by the anomalies on Earth. They were very useful for observing various parts of the Earth. Much of the intelligence was obtained through satellite imagery.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1032'>Chapter 1032: Shen Yuchi in a Great Mood</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Shen Yuchi had been in a good mood recently. Although he had suffered heavy losses previously, the bureau was still the eyes and ears of the Federation.</p>
<p>As the anomalies in the Federation intensified, Shen Yuchi made up for a lot of losses using various channels of intelligence.</p>
<p>However, the main reason why Shen Yuchi was in a good mood wasn’t because of this, but because of their recent discovery on the Moon.</p>
<p>Although the Earth’s anomalies were getting more and more serious and it was detrimental to the development of technology, it wasn’t completely without benefits.</p>
<p>The physique of humans had greatly improved. With a powerful Companion Beast, their survivability in space had greatly increased.</p>
<p>Humans with Mythical Companion Beasts equipped with equipment like space suits could do much more in space than before.</p>
<p>However, there were very few people who were willing to develop the space business. Shen Yuchi was one of the more determined ones.</p>
<p>He had always believed that even in this era, technology would one day occupy an important position. In particular, Shen Yuchi had invested a lot in aerospace technology.</p>
<p>Two months ago, humans had landed on the Moon again and made a major discovery.</p>
<p>A dimensional zone was discovered there. Furthermore, a large number of Essence Crystals were discovered in the dimensional zone. Apart from that, they also discovered something very strange. Shen Yuchi felt that this discovery might change the Federation’s present situation.</p>
<p>This was because the moon landing operation was mainly pushed by the bureau. Most of the astronauts on the moon were from the bureau, so Shen Yuchi quickly enforced a news blockade.</p>
<p>This will be the underlying reason for the bureau’s comeback. We mustn’t make any more mistakes. Shen Yuchi thought through the key details again. After confirming that there were no mistakes, he felt relieved and poured himself a cup of tea.</p>
<p>Just as he picked up the teacup, but before it touched his lips, someone reported, “Director-General… We found… found it…”</p>
<p>These words were unclear, but Shen Yuchi was overjoyed when he heard them. He immediately got up and walked out of the office to the main control room of the moon landing project.</p>
<p>“Director-General Shen, we just received a message from the Moon. We’ve finally found it,” an old professor said excitedly.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi held back his excitement and said, “Establish comms. I want to see that thing.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” The staff member quickly connected to the communication device on the Moon. Soon, an image of a certain part of the Moon appeared on the big screen.</p>
<p>A few people in space suits were inside a pit on the Moon. In the pit, there were many Essence Crystal ores.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi’s gaze wasn’t on the Essence Crystal ores at all. Although the reserves of the Essence Crystal ores here weren’t lower than the ones in the bureau, mining and transporting them was a problem. There was no easy solution for the time being.</p>
<p>Even if all of them were dug out, they weren’t something that could be transported back in a short period of time.</p>
<p>In comparison, something in the Essence Crystal ore was the focus of Shen Yuchi’s gaze.</p>
<p>It was a tree root with a tip as thick as a finger. It twisted and extended all the way into the Essence Crystal ore. The roots were as black as ink, but there were no signs of foulness.</p>
<p>It was clearly black like charcoal, but it gave off a holy feeling.</p>
<p>“That’s right. This is it. Dig it out.” Shen Yuchi suppressed the excitement in his heart and gave the order.</p>
<p>“Roger that.” After the astronaut received the order, he summoned a Companion Beast that looked like a rat but was as large as a bull. It continued digging towards the root.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast was at the Mythical stage. Among all the astronauts, it was only one. It was also because of its existence that these discoveries had been made.</p>
<p>Only Mythical Companion Beasts could survive in ordinary space environments and work normally.</p>
<p>Although some Epic creatures could just about survive, it was very difficult for them to work normally.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Shen Yuchi only wanted to know if there had been any changes to the Moon.</p>
<p>If the Moon hadn’t undergone any anomalies, perhaps he could build a base on it to prepare for a large-scale break-out of Earth’s dimensional zones in the future.</p>
<p>If the Federation really couldn’t hold on, there was still a way out.</p>
<p>With humanity’s present physique, as long as they could build a sealed base, it wasn’t impossible to live on the moon.</p>
<p>Of course, many resources still needed to be obtained from Earth. That was only a final form of insurance.</p>
<p>In the beginning, they didn’t discover any anomalies or dimensional zones on the Moon. Later, when they were exploring and taking samples, they discovered an Essence Crystal mine. That wasn’t much to speak off.</p>
<p>While excavating for samples from the Essence Crystal mine, the Mythical Companion Beast dug up something different.</p>
<p>It was a petal. It was white like snow, without any impurities. It was holy like snowflakes.</p>
<p>The petal was like a fossil that was enveloped by the Essence Crystal mine, but it didn’t petrify or wither. It remained bustling with vitality.</p>
<p>Discovering Essence Crystal ores on the Moon and some plants was nothing.</p>
<p>However, when the petal wrapped in the Essence Crystal mine was extracted, something shocking happened.</p>
<p>As they didn’t know what the petal was, they handled it through a Companion Beast in a sealed environment.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast was a Legendary Nature Elf. Although the level of a Nature Elf wasn’t high, its appearance was similar to a human’s. It could do precision work, so there were many similar Companion Beasts in a typical laboratory.</p>
<p>The moment the Nature Elf touched the petal, the petal melted and was absorbed by the Nature Elf. In a few hours, the Nature Elf advanced to the Epic stage.</p>
<p>This discovery shocked everyone.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi immediately ordered a news blockade and continued digging the Essence Crystal mine.</p>
<p>Indeed, they dug up a few more petals and carried out some experiments. The results of the experiments confirmed that these petals could indeed advance a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>With just one piece, a Companion Beast could easily advance to the Epic stage.</p>
<p>However, as there were too few petals, there was no way to test if the petals could advance an Epic Companion Beast to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>They did some simple research on this petal and realized that it resembled the petals of an osmanthus, an evergreen tree. However, it was unknown why such petals existed on the Moon.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi and many people from the East District immediately thought of a legend of the East District. In that legend, there was indeed an osmanthus tree on the moon.</p>
<p>In order to determine if there was really such an osmanthus tree, the Mythical Companion Beast had been diligently digging over the past few days. It had finally found something.</p>
<p>Just a petal is already so magical. Then what about a tree? Just the thought left Shen Yuchi’s heart beating especially fast.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1033'>Chapter 1033: Osmanthus Tree</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>More and more black roots were dug out. They were already more than two meters long, but there was still no end to them.</p>
<p>This made Shen Yuchi excited and nervous. He originally thought that he had dug up a broken root, but now, it looked like they had really dug up the osmanthus tree.</p>
<p>However, there was something that caught Shen Yuchi’s attention. When the Mythical Companion Beast was digging, it would occasionally come into contact with the roots. However, the roots weren’t absorbed like the flower petals, nor did anything strange happen.</p>
<p>Could it be that only the flower petals have a magical effect? Shen Yuchi was somewhat worried. If only the flower petals had an effect, how many flower petals were on the buried osmanthus tree?</p>
<p>However, everything was still unknown. He had no way of confirming that the osmanthus tree was useless. He didn’t know how many petals there were, so he could only continue waiting for the outcome.</p>
<p>A professor wanted an astronaut to cut off a portion of the roots and conduct a simple test in the space station, but even the Mythical Companion Beast couldn’t damage the roots at all.</p>
<p>The result was the same when using high-tech cutting equipment. The hardness of the roots far exceeded any known matter.</p>
<p>This outcome alarmed everyone, including Shen Yuchi. After all, a Mythical Companion Beast couldn’t even damage it at all. What kind of existence was that tree? It was truly shocking.</p>
<p>Now that there was no other way; they could only continue digging. More and more roots were dug out, and the crisscrossing was very complicated. It looked like they had really dug up the osmanthus tree.</p>
<p>During the excavation, they dug up quite a number of petals. Apart from a small number used for experiments and research, most of them were stored away.</p>
<p>As he saw more and more petals gathered, Shen Yuchi hated the fact that he couldn’t be on the Moon himself. He wanted to be a miner and dig up all the petals.</p>
<p>Such petals could bring immeasurable wealth to the bureau. Even if they couldn’t be used to advance an Epic creature to the Mythical stage, the ability to advance a Legendary to the Epic stage was enough to create unimaginable wealth.</p>
<p>After some research, they realized that repeated usage of the petals on the same Companion Beast had reduced effects. Different Companion Beasts underwent different levels of evolution using the same petal.</p>
<p>Epic Companion Beasts would have their stats enhanced to a certain extent—something which could be seen from the experiments.</p>
<p>The Mythical Companion Beast kept digging. After a period of time, it finally dug to the trunk of the osmanthus tree. The trunk was also pitch-black like ink. Based on what had already been dug out, it was probably more than ten meters in diameter.</p>
<p>A giant tree with a diameter of more than ten meters. When it’s in full bloom, how many osmanthus flowers will it produce? Everyone was pleasantly surprised when they saw the tree’s size.</p>
<p>Even if only one-thousandth of the flowers produced by the osmanthus tree was preserved, it was still an unimaginable number.</p>
<p>They impatiently ordered the Mythical Companion Beast to continue digging, but not long after, they realized that the tree trunk had reached its end.</p>
<p>“That’s all… How can there be nothing…” Shen Yuchi’s expression was somewhat ugly.</p>
<p>From the communication video, one could see that the huge osmanthus tree was in fact only a stump. The parts above seemed to have vanished.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast continued digging in the vicinity, but it only discovered sporadic petals. It didn’t find the snapped trunk.</p>
<p>On the tree stump, there were also obvious signs of cleaving. It proved that this mysterious and huge osmanthus tree hadn’t been cut off by a natural disaster. Instead, some creature had chopped it down.</p>
<p>Even the strength of a Mythical Companion Beast can’t injure the tiny roots at all. What kind of creature can chop through such a thick tree trunk? Shen Yuchi was alarmed just thinking about it.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there were no traces of dimensional creatures nearby. Furthermore, even if the main trunk was gone, there were still some scattered petals nearby. To the bureau, being able to gather these scattered petals already meant a huge fortune.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the tree stump might be of great value. Otherwise, there was no need for the mysterious creature to have taken it away. All he needed to do was remove the petals. There was no need for him to have gone through the trouble of chopping the tree.</p>
<p>The excavation continued. Every day, they would dig out at least ten petals. Sometimes, they would dig out dozens.</p>
<p>This excited the bureau and the researchers. After all, these petals didn’t just represent Epic Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Some Legendary Companion Beasts with very useful skills or Life Providences couldn’t be used due to their low levels and poor stats.</p>
<p>With these osmanthus flowers, they could raise these select Legendary Companion Beasts to the Epic stage and make up for their stats. They could even give birth to powerful Life Souls.</p>
<p>Having the osmanthus flowers was equivalent to having infinite possibilities.</p>
<p>Everyone felt that they would gain a huge harvest from this lunar expedition, but on this day, as the Mythical Companion Beast continued digging the tree stump in the bid to dig out all the parts of the tree stump and think of a way to transport it back to Earth—</p>
<p>The communications between Earth’s command center and the lunar space station came to an abrupt halt. No one knew what had happened. The researchers tried everything they could to contact the Moon, but there was no news from them. They had no way of knowing what had happened.</p>
<p>“Professor, can you think of a way to use the existing satellites to record the situation of the space station and the tree stump?” Shen Yuchi asked the old professor beside him.</p>
<p>The old professor said with a heavy expression, “It’s easy to use satellites to scan the space station, but the tree stump is in a position that can’t be captured.”</p>
<p>“Use the satellite to scan the space station first,” Shen Yuchi said.</p>
<p>“We’re already trying, but we need to wait for our satellites to reach a predetermined orbit. Otherwise, we can only rely on other satellites… I’m afraid it will leave traces…” the old professor said.</p>
<p>“How long will it take for our satellites to capture the space station?” Shen Yuchi asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“It should be around three hours and forty minutes,” the old professor answered.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi pondered for a moment before saying a word. He didn’t wish to attract anyone’s attention. “Wait.”</p>
<p>Time ticked by. Everyone waited nervously. When the satellite reached the required orbit, they immediately got busy.</p>
<p>Soon, the picture near the space station was sent back.</p>
<p>When they saw the picture, everyone was horrified. The entire space station base had sunk into a deep pit, and the deep pit looked like the footprint of some animal.</p>
<p>The space station seemed to have been flattened by a creature.</p>
<p>There’s a terrifying dimensional creature on the Moon… Everyone had ominous thoughts.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1034'>Chapter 1034: Space Suit</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen, Wang Lu, and company headed for the Imperial Capital. Along the way, they encountered quite a number of break-out creatures. Unfortunately, their levels weren’t too high. Without needing him to do anything, they were easily dispatched by Feng Qiuyan and Li Xuan.</p>
<p>The last time Zhou Wen had gone to the Imperial Capital, he was nearly killed by Xia Jiuhuang and the Guardian in the log. He had even fled from Forbidden City in a sorry state. He hadn’t even dared stay in the Imperial Capital for long as he fled back.</p>
<p>Now, it was different. Ignoring Demonic Neonate and the Seven Seas Dragon King, with the Terror-grade Ice Maiden around, it wouldn’t be easy for the Guardian in the log to touch him.</p>
<p>After Ice Maiden was restrained by the Seven Seas Dragon King, Zhou Wen used Explosive Fiend Man’s Death List to get Ice Maiden to sign her name.</p>
<p>Although it wasn’t easy to use Death List on the Terror-grade Ice Maiden, Zhou Wen wasn’t worried that she would go back on her word and attack him.</p>
<p>The sole reason was because the Heaven Shrouding Bell had been taken away by Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had tried to get the Heaven Shrouding Bell back, but to his surprise, he realized that the Heaven Shrouding Bell had been devoured by Demonic Neonate just like the Demonic Sword. It became Demonic Neonate’s skill, which also meant that it was a part of her. He couldn’t retrieve it at all.</p>
<p>As long as Demonic Neonate shook the Heaven Shrouding Bell, no matter how ferocious Ice Maiden was, she would obediently surrender without any chance of resisting.</p>
<p>As for Grim Demon inside the Demonic Sword, he had actually begun evolving independently after devouring Bizarre God. Zhou Wen didn’t know what changes he would undergo after his evolution.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, when Demonic Neonate evolved, as a part of the Demonic Sword, Grim Demon should already have gained the ability to transform into a Terror form. Now that it had evolved alone, it was unknown what its outcome would be.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden didn’t wish to be trapped in the Chaos Bead, so Zhou Wen didn’t force her to enter. Since she couldn’t escape, he decided to let her move freely.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>When he arrived at the Imperial Capital again, Zhou Wen swaggered into the city with Wang Lu without deliberately hiding his whereabouts.</p>
<p>“Director-General… Zhou Wen… Zhou Wen has come to the Imperial Capital…” Before Zhou Wen entered the Imperial Capital, the bureau had already been made aware.</p>
<p>“What’s he doing in the Imperial Capital?” Shen Yuchi felt a headache when he heard that.</p>
<p>In the past, he had yearned for Zhou Wen to come to the Imperial Capital so he could capture him.</p>
<p>But now, there was no point in capturing Zhou Wen. Even if there was meaning, how many people in the world could capture him?</p>
<p>Based on the information the bureau had, even a ranked Guardian might not be able to capture Zhou Wen if they wanted to. Furthermore, the bureau didn’t have such a figure.</p>
<p>“Pay attention to his whereabouts, but don’t follow him directly. You just need to use the surveillance equipment network on Imperial Capital Street. If he wants to leave your line of sight, there’s no need to determine his whereabouts,” Shen Yuchi said after some thought.</p>
<p>Not long after, the inspector ran back and said with a strange expression, “Director-General… He seems to be heading for our bureau’s headquarters…”</p>
<p>“Are you sure he’s coming to the bureau?” Shen Yuchi frowned.</p>
<p>“He’s already passed Sky Street and is heading east. If he’s heading this way, the chances of him coming to our bureau are the highest,” the inspector said.</p>
<p>“East of Sky Street… It looks like he really wants to come to the bureau. Is he alone? Is there anyone else with him?” Shen Yuchi asked again.</p>
<p>“He’s also carrying a girl who looks about two years old. Wang Lu, Feng Qiuyan, and Li Xuan, who entered the Imperial Capital with him, went to the Wang family residence. They didn’t join him,” the inspector hurriedly said.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen headed for Sky Pass. Sky Pass was a dimensional zone in the Imperial Capital, as well as the location of the bureau’s headquarters.</p>
<p>As Sky Pass was protected by powerful dimensional zone taboos, outsiders had no way of entering it alive. Even if the inspectors wanted to enter the Sky Pass, they needed permission from the higher-ups. They couldn’t enter freely, or they would be killed by the taboo power of the Sky Pass.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen arrived at a fork in the road and saw a middle-aged man passing by. He went over and asked, “Uncle, is Sky Pass ahead?”</p>
<p>“You want to go to Sky Pass? Do you know what kind of place it is?” The middle-aged man sized up Zhou Wen in surprise.</p>
<p>“I heard that it’s the bureau’s headquarters. I want to buy something there,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“Buy something from the bureau’s headquarters?” The middle-aged man was even more surprised. He looked at Zhou Wen and asked, “Do you know what the bureau does?”</p>
<p>“I’m not too sure. I heard that there are quite a number of good things there that I’d like to buy.” Zhou Wen asked again, “Do you know which way the bureau is?”</p>
<p>“I’m about to head to the bureau. If you want to go, come along,” the middle-aged man said with interest.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Zhou Wen said gratefully.</p>
<p>“You’re welcome. It’s on the way. What do you want to buy from the bureau?” The middle-aged man was very curious.</p>
<p>The bureau’s headquarters wasn’t a good host. It was difficult to enter, but it was even harder to leave. No one would go to such a place for no reason. If it wasn’t necessary, the middle-aged man wouldn’t have gone to the bureau.</p>
<p>“I want to buy some space equipment,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man was even more interested when he heard that. He said to Zhou Wen, “Are you interested in space exploration?”</p>
<p>“I’m not too interested. I just want to go into space on a tour,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“Tour?” The middle-aged man shook his head and said with grimace, “Current space technology hasn’t developed to the point where we can travel freely in space. However, as the human physique improves, what was only possible for highly-trained astronauts is now possible as long as they are at the Legendary stage even without any training. However, it would be a waste of manpower and resources just for traveling.”</p>
<p>“Are you an expert in this area?” Zhou Wen sized up the middle-aged man and asked.</p>
<p>“I can’t be considered an expert. You can call me a businessman. My company specializes in producing space suits for astronauts,” the middle-aged man said.</p>
<p>“Space suits? Then does your company sell equipment like space cabins that can allow ordinary people to survive in space for a period of time?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“No, that kind of thing involves too much technology. It can’t be done. Our company’s space suits are alright. If you are interested, you can visit our company later. It’s best not to go to a place like the bureau,” the middle-aged man said.</p>
<p>“Uncle, how may I address you? Why are you going to the bureau?” Zhou Wen sized up the middle-aged man and asked.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man roughly explained his situation as they walked. His name was Tang Zhizhong. Previously, the bureau had been in a partnership with their company. The space suits used were all products customized by their company.</p>
<p>Over the years, their space suits had never had any problems. Their research team had also been researching and developing better and more practical space suits. They could be said to be the top space suits manufacturers in the Federation.</p>
<p>However, some time ago, the bureau’s partnership with them ended and they switched to using another company’s products. Even the batch of space suits they had previously ordered were rejected for various reasons.</p>
<p>Tang Zhizhong originally thought that there was a problem with his product, but after asking around, he realized that it wasn’t the case.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1035'>Chapter 1035: Surrender</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Another company seemed to have used their connections to obtain the order from the bureau.</p>
<p>Tang Zhizhong also acquired the other company’s space suits to do a comparison test. He found that their space suits were not as good as his company’s, which made Tang Zhizhong very angry.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the space suits that the bureau had ordered previously would have a huge impact on Tang Zhizhong’s company if they didn’t take receipt of the goods. It might even collapse.</p>
<p>There weren’t many technology companies nowadays, and it was very difficult for them to survive. Tang Zhizhong came this time because he hoped that the bureau could take receipt of the batch of space suits according to the contract. It didn’t matter if they stopped the partnership in the future.</p>
<p>“It’s getting tougher and tougher for technology companies these days. If I can ride through this ordeal, I’m prepared to close down the business. There’s no future if I continue. Even if I don’t go bankrupt this time, it will eventually happen in the future. Young people nowadays only want to enter a dimensional zone to obtain Companion Beasts. No one’s dream is to explore the universe,” Tang Zhizhong said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“How long can your company’s space suits last in space?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“That depends on the environment. There are so many terrifying phenomena in space that it wouldn’t be of much use even if you wore a space suit. The primary use nowadays is in places like the Moon and space stations. If it’s in a relatively safe area on the Moon, as long as there’s enough oxygen, food, and water, the space suit I manufacture won’t have any problems generally speaking, for a year or two. As long as the life support system isn’t destroyed, there’s no need to worry about survival.” When Tang Zhizhong mentioned the space suit, he immediately became extremely confident.</p>
<p>“Can I eat and drink while wearing a space suit?” Zhou Wen asked Tang Zhizhong. At the same time, he thought to himself, Going to the moon seems like a good idea. It won’t be difficult to use the Chaos Bead to carry enough oxygen, food, and water for a month.</p>
<p>“Of course. Our company has been constantly researching and improving space suits. We can do all the daily necessities like eating, drinking, and defecating in space suits. However, the premise is that we have enough supplies. The life support system of space suits can’t carry that many reserves…” As the two of them spoke, they had already arrived outside Sky Pass.</p>
<p>“How many space suits did the bureau order from you?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“110 sets,” Tang Zhizhong answered.</p>
<p>“Where are those space suits now?” Zhou Wen asked as he sent a message to Wang Lu, asking her to help investigate Tang Zhizhong’s company.</p>
<p>“They are still in the warehouse. The bureau has been looking for all sorts of reasons to not take receipt of them. I only hope that they will take the space suits even if I’m required to kneel and kowtow. There are so many employees in the company who are counting on the space suit payment for their wages,” Tang Zhizhong said with a long face.</p>
<p>After receiving Wang Lu’s message, Zhou Wen said to Tang Zhizhong, “Uncle Tang, bring the space suits over. I guarantee that the bureau will accept them.”</p>
<p>“Are… Are you serious?” Tang Zhizhong looked at Zhou Wen in disbelief. Zhou Wen was so young, and he was clearly not a local. It was difficult for him to believe that Zhou Wen had such great power.</p>
<p>“You should know very well that it’s impossible for the bureau to take receipt of your space suit. If you believe me, there will still be a chance. If you don’t believe me, there won’t be a chance at all.” Zhou Wen looked at the time on his phone. “I’ll give you an hour. If you can send the space suits over, I guarantee that the bureau will take receipt of them and pay you accordingly. The premise is that I have to see those space suits with my own eyes.”</p>
<p>“May I know who you are?” Tang Zhizhong looked at Zhou Wen in surprise.</p>
<p>“Does it matter who I am? Time waits for no one. You only have 59 minutes left.” Zhou Wen looked at the time again.</p>
<p>“Please wait. It won’t take an hour. I’ll get someone to deliver them in half an hour.” Tang Zhizhong also knew that there was almost no chance of success going to the bureau to ask for money. He was just giving it a shot.</p>
<p>Tang Zhizhong made a call and contacted his staff to get them to deliver the space suits over as soon as possible.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Sky Pass was also known as the number one pass in the world. It was a very famous and unknown dimensional zone in the Imperial Capital.</p>
<p>The reason why this place was famous was that in the decades since Sky Pass became a dimensional zone, no one had been able to enter Sky Pass through the main entrance. Later on, someone discovered a special method to bypass the main entrance and enter.</p>
<p>And the person who discovered this method was the bureau’s director-general, Shen Yuchi. Therefore, this place later became the bureau’s headquarters.</p>
<p>It wasn’t famous because other than the members of the bureau, very few people could enter Sky Pass. Very few people knew what was inside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood in front of Sky Pass and saw a majestic city gate tower. However, the city wall was forty meters tall. On the tall signboard, there were four majestic words: “World’s Number One Pass.”</p>
<p>Typical city gates opened on both sides outwards, but the city gates here didn’t have two panes. They looked like they were one entity without any gaps.</p>
<p>Legend had it that this was an unbreachable door. Back then, Sky Pass was very famous. Many experts hoped to be the first to enter.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even if they attacked Sky Pass with Mythical Companion Beasts, no one could break through the city gates.</p>
<p>Up to now, the city gates of Sky Pass had never opened.</p>
<p>“Bro… No, no… Young… Sir… Who are you related to in the bureau? Can you really help us get the bureau to take receipt of the space suits?” Tang Zhizhong asked nervously after ending the call.</p>
<p>“Many people in the bureau know me, including Director-General Shen Yuchi,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Tang Zhizhong was overjoyed when he heard that. “That’s great. Our company is saved. Sir, what’s your name? What’s your relationship with Director-General Shen? Are you his relative?”</p>
<p>Tang Zhizhong wondered if Zhou Wen was Shen Yuchi’s son. Otherwise, how could he get the bureau to so easily take receipt of his space suits?</p>
<p>To his surprise, Zhou Wen said, “Director-General Shen and the bureau have been trying to arrest me for a long time. My arrest warrant should still be hanging on Director-General Shen’s wall, I guess?”</p>
<p>“You… You… Are you joking?” Tang Zhizhong was somewhat dumbfounded as he looked at Zhou Wen in a daze.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t answer. He stood in front of Sky Pass and looked at the guards on the city gate tower.</p>
<p>Tang Zhizhong traced his gaze and saw rows of inspectors standing on the city gate tower that only had a few guards. All of them were pointing their guns at them.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, why are you here at the bureau?” the leader of the people on the city gate tower said to Zhou Wen from above.</p>
<p>Tang Zhizhong recognized that person. He was one of the four Censors under Shen Yuchi—Yu Guang. Although he was in the Imperial Capital, he was still a famous person.</p>
<p>“Haven’t you always wanted to arrest me? I’m here to surrender myself.” Zhou Wen extended his hands as though he was waiting to be handcuffed.</p>
<p>Tang Zhizhong was already dumbfounded. Even a fool could tell that Zhou Wen was really a wanted criminal of the bureau, but how could a wanted criminal be so foolish as to surrender himself?</p>
<h3 id='chapter1036'>Chapter 1036: Cold-Faced Hades</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Surrender?” Countless question marks appeared over Yu Guang’s head.</p>
<p>As for Shen Yuchi and the bureau’s top brass who were watching everything through the surveillance cameras, their expressions turned very strange.</p>
<p>At this moment, only an idiot would believe Zhou Wen when he said that he wanted to surrender. If he really wanted to surrender, he should have come a long time ago. Why would he wait until now?</p>
<p>“Director-General, what should we do?” Yu Guang whispered to Shen Yuchi through the communicator.</p>
<p>“Director-General, you mustn’t let Zhou Wen in. This must be his scheme to overthrow our bureau,” a director immediately warned.</p>
<p>“That’s right. That Zhou Wen can’t enter Sky Pass, so he’s trying to use such a method to sneak in. He definitely wants to kill us. We definitely can’t let him in.”</p>
<p>“Director-General, Zhou Wen is Wang Mingyuan’s disciple. We have to be wary!”</p>
<p>The bureau’s brass were surprisingly unanimous. They definitely couldn’t let Zhou Wen in.</p>
<p>The average person might not know how terrifying Zhou Wen was, but what kind of place was the bureau? This was where the ears and eyes of the Federation were. They knew Zhou Wen better than anyone else.</p>
<p>It could be said that Zhou Wen’s file was ranked one of the highest in the Federation. It was ranked alongside Jing Daoxian, Wang Mingyuan, and a few others. Even the Federation’s Senators’ files weren’t as confidential as Zhou Wen’s.</p>
<p>They knew very well how terrifying Zhou Wen was. The information they had obtained from their investigations was shocking. Anyone who had read the information would no longer treat him as an undergraduate unless they had a screw loose.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi was naturally the one in the bureau with the deepest understanding of Zhou Wen, so he felt a headache coming on.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi naturally didn’t believe a word of Zhou Wen’s claims of surrendering. However, Zhou Wen had already come to the bureau. Would he leave so easily?</p>
<p>“Put him at ease first. Find out what he wants.” Shen Yuchi ordered Yu Guang. He knew that escaping was definitely not a solution. He had to think of a way to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>Tang Zhizhong was at a loss and didn’t know what to do.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was actually a wanted criminal of the bureau. Furthermore, he had a screw loose and wanted to surrender.</p>
<p>Everyone knew that the bureau was unreasonable. As long as one’s brain wasn’t damaged, they wouldn’t turn themselves in. Even if they felt bad and chose to commit suicide to atone for their sins, they wouldn’t turn themselves in.</p>
<p>It’s over, it’s over. I actually believed the words of a lunatic and even got someone to send the space suits over. Isn’t this asking for trouble? Tang Zhizhong was already a little afraid.</p>
<p>The bureau had already made up its mind to break the contract. If they found an excuse to arrest him along with this lunatic, he might lose his life, much less money.</p>
<p>Just as Tang Zhizhong was feeling alarmed, he heard Yu Guang speak from the top of the city gates.</p>
<p>Tang Zhizhong was no stranger to Yu Guang. He was one of the four Censors of the bureau. Apart from Cai Jin who had died previously, he was the most senior.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Yu Guang was the head of the General Affairs Department. All sorts of matters in the bureau needed to go through him.</p>
<p>The matter of the space suits also had to go through Yu Guang, only he was only responsible for the final decision. There were still plenty of officers under him, so Tang Zhizhong had had no chance to personally discuss this matter with Yu Guang.</p>
<p>Previously, he had come here a few times wanting to meet Yu Guang to clarify the matter about the space suit. However, Yu Guang wouldn’t see him at all and only let Tang Zhizhong talk to the officers under him.</p>
<p>Yu Guang also had another nickname, Cold-faced Hades. From this nickname, one could tell what kind of person he usually was.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid there’s been a misunderstanding. Our bureau has never had a warrant for you, and you aren’t a criminal.” He paused for a moment before saying, “I’ve heard some things about you. You are a good student with excellent grades and morals. You are humble and sincere. You have contributed a lot to our Federation, so why is there a need for you to surrender?”</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Tang Zhizhong listened to Yu Guang and then looked at the kind face Yu Guang was wearing. He almost thought that he had recognized the wrong person.</p>
<p>Is this really the Cold-faced Hades, Yu Guang? Tang Zhizhong sized up Yu Guang again and again to confirm that he had not misidentified him. It was Cold-faced Hades, Yu Guang. There was no mistake about that.</p>
<p>“There’s no misunderstanding. I’m guilty. I feel bad and wish to redeem myself,” Zhou Wen said with a serious expression.</p>
<p>“See that? This fellow is just looking for trouble. He wants to enter Sky Pass and kill us. We definitely can’t let him in,” a director shouted from the office.</p>
<p>“Yu Guang, figure out his intentions first.” Shen Yuchi frowned slightly, but he didn’t panic.</p>
<p>The world’s number one pass wasn’t an empty title. No matter how strong Zhou Wen was, it was impossible for him to forcefully enter Sky Pass.</p>
<p>It’s over, it’s over. It wasn’t easy for Cold-faced Hades to show kindness and say something humane. Yet, this punk actually wants to court death! Tang Zhizhong’s expression was ashen. He felt Yu Guang definitely wouldn’t let Zhou Wen off after what he said. He would capture him first before deciding if he was guilty or not.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, Yu Guang turned even friendlier. His smile became even more amiable. “The Special Investigation Bureau isn’t a law-enforcement organization. If you really want to surrender yourself, you should go to the police station. However, I know your character. You are a promising youth and a future pillar of the Federation. You’re not the kind of person to commit crimes. Did you encounter any difficulties? If you have any difficulties, tell us. The Special Investigation Bureau is a ministry under the Federation. We have the obligation to resolve the problems for federal citizens…”</p>
<p>Tang Zhizhong listened in a daze and felt that he was dreaming.</p>
<p>The bureau isn’t a law-enforcement agency? It is obligated to help federal citizens resolve their problems? Is this still the bureau I know? Is this still the Cold-faced Hades I know? Tang Zhizhong suddenly realized that the young man in front of him might not be a lunatic.</p>
<p>Just as Yu Guang was trying his best to persuade Zhou Wen, trucks quickly drove over from afar. It was Tang Zhizhong’s company delivering the space suits over.</p>
<p>The trucks drove very quickly and soon, a row of trucks had stopped not far from Tang Zhizhong.</p>
<p>A middle-aged man jumped out of the truck eagerly. As he ran to Tang Zhizhong, he asked loudly, “Old Tang, what’s the situation? Is the bureau willing to take receipt of this batch of goods? After you gave the instructions, I delivered the goods here as quickly as possible. How do we do the handover?”</p>
<p>“No, the bureau didn’t agree to take receipt of our goods,” Tang Zhizhong said.</p>
<p>“They didn’t agree to take receipt of them? Then why did you get us to deliver the goods here?” Many of the factory employees got out of the trucks and surrounded Tang Zhizhong, looking at him eagerly.</p>
<p>They were all hoping that they would be paid after the goods were accepted. They needed to support their families.</p>
<p>“This Mr. Zhou said that he can get the bureau to take receipt for us,” Tang Zhizhong said with a complicated expression as he pointed at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“He’s from the bureau?” Everyone looked at Zhou Wen. They found it unbelievable when they saw how young he was.</p>
<p>“No… No… He’s a criminal who wants to surrender…” When Tang Zhizhong spoke, his expression became even stranger.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1037'>Chapter 1037: Brazen Extortion</h3>
<p>“Surrender? Criminal?” Everyone looked at Zhou Wen and Tang Zhizhong in surprise.</p>
<p>“Old Tang, is this the time for jokes? Everyone is waiting for this sum of money.” The middle-aged man who came first thought that Tang Zhizhong was joking.</p>
<p>Tang Zhizhong grimaced, unsure how he could explain the situation. At this moment, Zhou Wen said to Yu Guang on the city gate, “I did encounter some difficulties. Is your bureau really willing to help me?”</p>
<p>“It’s our duty as the bureau to resolve the problems for federal citizens. If there are any difficulties, feel free to tell us. As long as it’s within the scope of our authority, we will definitely uphold justice for you…” Yu Guang said righteously like an impartial Justice Bao from ancient China.</p>
<p>“Old Tang, that person seems to be Yu Guang, right?” The middle-aged man looked at Yu Guang with uncertainty. He knew Yu Guang, but wasn’t too sure today.</p>
<p>“It’s Yu Guang alright.” Tang Zhizhong nodded.</p>
<p>“But why would Yu Guang…” The middle-aged man was doubtful as his eyes were filled with puzzlement.</p>
<p>“It’s because of him.” Tang Zhizhong looked in Zhou Wen’s direction and whispered to the middle-aged man, “Perhaps they will take receipt of our space suits this time.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been very interested in space suits recently. I want to buy a few space suits to study. Perhaps I can contribute to the Federation’s aeronautical industry. However, as you know, I’m just a poor student. I don’t have much money to begin with, and I’ve always been wanted by your bureau. I don’t have the money to buy space suits…” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Director-General, what should we do?” Yu Guang realized that Zhou Wen was blatantly extorting them. He had no choice but to seek Shen Yuchi’s advice again.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi looked at Tang Zhizhong and the others through the surveillance monitor and asked with a frown, “That should be Tang Zhizhong from the Tang Aerospace, right? I remember that he has always been a space-suit supplier for our bureau’s space program. What’s going on with them?”</p>
<p>Immediately, a director stood up and said, “Director-General, it’s like this. We recently changed space-suit suppliers, so we have some differences in contract with Tang Aerospace.”</p>
<p>“Tang’s space suits have always been of high quality. Why did we switch suppliers?” Shen Yuchi asked with a frown.</p>
<p>Everyone immediately fell silent. Shen Yuchi pointed at them with his finger, but he didn’t say a word. Finally, he said into the communicator, “You know how to deal with the matter regarding Tang Aerospace, right?”</p>
<p>“I know,” Yu Guang replied. He hurriedly said to Zhou Wen, “It’s our duty to support the development of young talents. The bureau has many advanced space suits. If you are interested in studying them, I can make the decision to give you a few.”</p>
<p>“I heard that Tang Aerospace’s space suits are currently the best and most advanced in the Federation. I’m more interested in theirs,” Zhou Wen added.</p>
<p>“That’s easy. Tang Aerospace is our bureau’s space suit supplier. We just ordered a batch of space suits. If you want them, I can sponsor a few sets for you,” Yu Guang immediately said.</p>
<p>“Are you talking about this batch?” Zhou Wen asked as he pointed at the trucks.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Yu Guang.</p>
<p>“I heard that there’s a problem with this batch of goods. You haven’t taken receipt of them yet. Could there really be a problem?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“That’s just a rumor. Tang Aerospace’s space suits have always been of high quality. There’s definitely no problem. We were just about to acknowledge receipt,” Yu Guang said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“Then quickly take receipt. You have to check the goods carefully. I don’t want any inferior products,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>Yu Guang had no choice but to send someone to check the goods. The entire process went surprisingly smoothly. In less than ten minutes, the inspection was completed on the spot and the goods were collected.</p>
<p>Tang Zhizhong and the other employees of Tang Aerospace felt like they were dreaming.</p>
<p>After taking receipt, the bureau didn’t dare move the space suits inside the trucks into Sky Pass. They were afraid that Zhou Wen would take the opportunity to rush in when Sky Pass opened.</p>
<p>“There are so many space suits. Are you planning on giving them all for my research? The bureau sure is generous.” Zhou Wen gave a thumbs up before saying to Tang Zhizhong, “These space suits were given to me by the bureau. Please help me send them to this location. Is there a problem?”</p>
<p>“No… No problem…” Tang Zhizhong took the slip of paper with the address written on it and hurriedly ordered the employees to reload the trucks with the space suits.</p>
<p>The bigwigs from the bureau were depressed. That was more than a hundred sets of space suits. They needed to pay a large sum of money for them. Although it wasn’t a huge sum to the bureau, they were still displeased that Zhou Wen had taken them all.</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou, thank you. Thank you so much.” Tang Zhizhong brought a few company executives over to thank Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to thank me. They were bought by the bureau. It has nothing to do with me. Just help me deliver them to the place,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou, don’t worry. We promise to deliver them to your requested location. This is my number. If there’s any problem with the space suits in the future, call me at any time. Even if the company closes down, I will provide you with after-sales service.” Tang Zhizhong handed his number to Zhou Wen with both hands.</p>
<p>“Alright, you may leave.” Zhou Wen took the slip of paper with the number written on it and looked at Yu Guang. He had no intention of leaving.</p>
<p>Although the space suits could resolve the problem regarding his survival in space, they could only be used in relatively safe areas. Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if he could teleport to a safe area, so he wanted more.</p>
<p>Helping Tang Zhizhong and the rest was just a matter of convenience. This small price was not enough to settle his grudge with the bureau.</p>
<p>“Actually, I’m also very interested in a space station. I want to study it…” Tang Zhizhong and company’s hands trembled when they heard Zhou Wen’s words.</p>
<p>“Let’s leave quickly and safely deliver the things to Mr. Zhou’s designated location.” Tang Zhizhong jolted the stunned middle-aged man and urged him to drive faster.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man started the truck, but he couldn’t help but glance at Zhou Wen through the rearview mirror. He said with a complicated expression, “Old Tang, that young… Mr. Zhou… Who is he? Even Cold-faced Hades seems to be very afraid of him…”</p>
<p>“It’s not just Cold-faced Hades. I heard that Shen Yuchi is also in Sky Pass and hasn’t stepped out,” Tang Zhizhong said softly.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man’s expression changed again. “Mr. Zhou is so young, but he can already intimidate the bureau. It’s unbelievable…”</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi was at a loss. Zhou Wen was asking for too much. The space station’s equipment required a lot of technology and various materials. In this era, it was very difficult to acquire most of the technology and materials. Constructing a space station could be said to be filled with difficulties.</p>
<p>The bureau didn’t even have many space stations built by themselves, yet Zhou Wen was asking for one.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Shen Yuchi seemed to think of something as his eyes lit up. He said into the communicator, “Bring Zhou Wen in. I want to talk to him.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1038'>Chapter 1038: Shen Yuchi’s Suggestion</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Zhou Wen.”</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to see if he could extort a space station, a small door appeared beside Sky Pass’s main entrance. An extremely majestic man walked out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen recognized him at a glance. He was the bureau’s director-general, Shen Yuchi. Zhou Wen had met Shen Yuchi when he had gone to Sunset College because of Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>However, back then, Shen Yuchi was a mountain that Zhou Wen could only look up to. Shen Yuchi could kill him with a flip of his hand.</p>
<p>Things were now completely different. Zhou Wen was completely confident that he could kill Shen Yuchi.</p>
<p>As the boss of the bureau, Shen Yuchi actually walked out of Sky Pass alone. He didn’t bring any inspectors with him as he walked towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Even though Zhou Wen had always treated the bureau as an enemy, he had no choice but to applaud Shen Yuchi’s bearing. Just by standing there casually, he gave off a dignified aura like an inviolable mountain.</p>
<p>“Director-General Shen, it’s really not easy to meet you,” Zhou Wen said to Shen Yuchi.</p>
<p>“Why do you want to see me?” Shen Yuchi said indifferently.</p>
<p>“I should be the one asking you that, Director-General Shen. Hasn’t the bureau always wanted to invite me over?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi’s aura was as heavy as a mountain. He said with a heavy voice, “The bureau wanted to arrest you because of your relationship with Jing Daoxian, even more so because you are Wang Mingyuan’s disciple. This is a standard procedure. We have a clear conscience.”</p>
<p>“In that case, are you saying I was wrong?” Zhou Wen stared coldly at Shen Yuchi.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi’s gaze didn’t dodge or show compromise. He looked into Zhou Wen’s eyes and continued, “From the bureau’s standpoint, you were indeed wrong. However, it’s meaningless to say who’s right and who’s wrong now. With your strength, there’s no value talking about right or wrong with you.”</p>
<p>“Director-General Shen, are you calling me a lawless thug?” Zhou Wen asked calmly.</p>
<p>“Of course not. I’ve repeatedly studied your information. Perhaps you don’t believe me. My understanding of your personality might be better than yours,” Shen Yuchi said.</p>
<p>“I would like to hear what kind of person I am.” Zhou Wen looked at Shen Yuchi with interest.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi said slowly, “If you hear my evaluation, I’m afraid you will want to kill me, so there’s no point saying it out loud. However, I have a suggestion regarding the grudge between you and the bureau. I believe you will be interested.”</p>
<p>“Tell me about it,” Zhou Wen said as he stared at Shen Yuchi.</p>
<p>“Summon one of your Legendary Companion Beasts,” Shen Yuchi said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat curious why a person like Shen Yuchi dared to meet him alone. What did he rely on? Therefore, he summoned a Legendary Companion Beast according to Shen Yuchi’s request.</p>
<p>It was a Legendary Vajra Malla, a dimensional creature commonly seen in Dragon Gate Grotto.</p>
<p>“Vajra Malla. Not a bad Legendary Companion Beast. It’s rare,” Shen Yuchi said as he took out an Essence Crystal and held it in his palm.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled as to why Shen Yuchi took out an Essence Crystal. However, when he looked carefully, he realized that there was a snow-white petal inside the Essence Crystal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t ask what it was because he knew that since Shen Yuchi had taken it out, he would definitely explain it clearly.</p>
<p>He was just a little curious how magical this petal was to give Shen Yuchi the confidence of moving him with a single petal.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi didn’t say anything else. He crushed the Essence Crystal and let the petal fly out. Then, he used the wind from his palm to send the petal to the Vajra Malla.</p>
<p>The petal landed on the Vajra Malla’s head and, like melting snow, it fused into the Vajra Malla’s body.</p>
<p>Following that, Zhou Wen saw the Vajra Malla’s body emit a strange glow. It had actually begun evolving.</p>
<p>The Vajra Malla was only a low-level Companion Beast and didn’t have any evolutionary attributes. Therefore, under normal circumstances, there was no possibility of it evolving.</p>
<p>However, that tiny petal had actually allowed the Vajra Malla to begin evolving. It was truly shocking.</p>
<p>“There are no permanent enemies in the world, only interests. Let’s not talk about who’s right or wrong in the past. Now, even if you slaughter the entire bureau, you won’t be able to obtain any benefits. However, as long as you are willing, you can obtain such flowers together with the bureau… There are thousands of them…” Shen Yuchi said slowly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat tempted. Ignoring the fact that these petals were useless against high-level Companion Beasts, they were very useful to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>This was because many Mythical Companion Beasts had difficulty advancing in the early stages. He had no choice but to wait for them to slowly grow.</p>
<p>With such flowers, Zhou Wen could use them to rapidly grow Mythical Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>For example, it was extremely difficult to advance the Evil Spirit King. This was because Mortal Companion Eggs were rare. Although Zhou Wen had bought quite a number of them, he still didn’t meet the requirements needed to advance the Evil Spirit King.</p>
<p>If he had such flowers, he could directly advance the Evil Spirit King without having to go through so much trouble.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Shen Yuchi’s claim that there were thousands of them tempted Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Why should I believe you?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we go in and take a look at the information we recorded? You can then make a decision.” Shen Yuchi smiled. He knew that Zhou Wen had been moved.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Shen Yuchi entered Sky Pass and arrived at the bureau’s base. He also saw the information that Shen Yuchi and company had recorded on the moon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw the entire discovery process of the osmanthus petals and osmanthus tree stump through the videos.</p>
<p>He knew that Shen Yuchi wasn’t lying. At their excavation speed, they might discover thousands of osmanthus petals. Furthermore, there was a mysterious osmanthus tree stump there. Perhaps it was more valuable than the petals.</p>
<p>Could it be that that’s the legendary osmanthus tree on the moon? Then, do the legendary woodcutter, Moon Palace Fairy, and Moon Rabbit also exist? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>“We’ll work together to gather the osmanthus flowers. After the matter is done, half the harvest will be yours,” Shen Yuchi said.</p>
<p>“Director-General Shen, you don’t seem like someone who will throw money at a problem,” Zhou Wen said to Shen Yuchi.</p>
<p>“Consider it mutually beneficial. Look further.” Shen Yuchi played the final video.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen saw the huge footprint and the flattened space station.</p>
<p>“There are other dimensional creatures on the moon?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“Our bureau doesn’t plan on giving up on such divine items. Therefore, I plan on taking men to the Moon personally. If you are willing to go with me, my promise will still be valid. No matter how many osmanthus flowers we obtain, you can have half,” Shen Yuchi said.</p>
<p>“Apart from half the osmanthus flowers, I want that tree stump,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Pleasure to work with you.” Shen Yuchi raised his teacup.</p>

<p>When Zhou Wen returned to Wang Lu’s house, the 110 space suits had already been delivered.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you’re here.” Wang Chan was very happy to see Zhou Wen. It was obvious that she had been in a good mood recently.</p>
<p>Although she was still affected by the Misfortune Life Providence, her mood was not as bad as before.</p>
<p>“I heard them say that you bought these space suits. Why did you buy so many? Do you want to go to heaven?” Wang Chan asked curiously.</p>
<p>“That’s right. I want to go up and take a look at the Moon to see if there’s the legendary Moon Rabbit or Chang’e,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Tch, those are all stories used to deceive children. There’s no Moon Rabbit or Chang’e. Even if there are, they are dimensional creatures,” Wang Chan said with a pout.</p>
<p>“It’s even better if they’re dimensional creatures. Maybe I can get a Chang’e Companion Beast to play with,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Are you Pigsy from Journey to the West?” Wang Chan said with widened eyes.</p>
<p>“Why am I Pigsy?” Zhou Wen asked cooperatively.</p>
<p>“If you weren’t Pigsy, why would you think of something like that?” Wang Chan said with a smile.</p>
<p>While Wang Lu and the others were around, Zhou Wen told them about his time at the bureau.</p>
<p>In fact, Li Xuan and the others had already learned a lot from Tang Zhizhong. However, they didn’t know what had happened at the end.</p>
<p>“Shen Yuchi is a very terrifying person. My grandmother once evaluated him and said that he was an old turtle,” said Wang Lu.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was surprised. “Why is he called an old turtle? Could it be that he knows how to shrink?”</p>
<p>Wang Lu said, “Turtles may seem stupid and don’t seem to pose a threat. However, when a turtle really attacks, it is shockingly fast. Furthermore, as long as it bites, it will definitely not let go. Shen Yuchi is the same. He usually doesn’t reveal any flaws, and he’s fine when he doesn’t attack. Once he attacks, he will definitely bring doom to the victim. If such a person was born in the six families, his status would definitely not stop there. Even with his average background, he’s now a hot figure in the Federation. From this, we can tell how terrifying he is.”</p>
<p>“You embarrassed the bureau in front of everyone this time, but he still calmly negotiated a partnership with you. I have a nagging feeling that he won’t let this matter rest.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. There’s nothing good about a department like the Special Investigation Bureau. Shen Yuchi most likely invited you to the Moon to use you to get rid of the dimensional creatures there before thinking of a way to deal with you. Although your Companion Beasts are powerful, it’s too easy for something to happen to you on the Moon. I think it’s better not to go,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Actually, even if Shen Yuchi hadn’t invited me, I’d still want to make a trip to the moon. I have an Essence Energy Skill that’s at a critical juncture. I might have it break through by making a trip to the Moon. I agreed to Shen Yuchi’s request because I wanted to take advantage of the situation. Besides, if there really are those osmanthus flowers, they will be very useful to me. I don’t want to miss this opportunity,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>He had originally planned on using his interstellar teleportation ability to visit the nearest Moon. However, in that case, he needed to be prepared to live on the Moon alone for a month.</p>
<p>Now that Shen Yuchi had invited him, he could visit it via rocket. If Shen Yuchi really wanted to deal with him, he could also use Glimmer’s interstellar teleportation to directly teleport back to Earth.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he had terrifyingly powerful existences on him. If Shen Yuchi really wanted to scheme against him, it was unknown who would suffer in the end.</p>
<p>“That’s true. To think that there are petals that can directly enhance a Companion Beast’s stage. That’s too satisfying,” Li Xuan added.</p>
<p>“In short, you have to be careful of Shen Yuchi. You must not trust him easily,” Wang Lu reminded him again and again.</p>
<p>“Got it. I’ll leave Ya’er for you guys to take care of her while I’m away. She’s relatively introverted and isn’t good at communicating with others. If she has offended anyone, don’t take it to heart on my account.” Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid that the Wang family would bully her, but he was afraid that the Wang family would anger Ya’er and result in her wiping them out.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. We’ll take care of Ya’er like she’s our biological sister.” Wang Chan patted Ya’er’s head like a big sister.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, let me accompany you. You are unfamiliar with the crappy Moon. It’s better to have more people to watch each other’s backs,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“It’s best you don’t go. That place is different from Earth. If something happens here, as long as you don’t die, there’s still hope. If something happens there, where there’s no oxygen, even if you have an immortal body, it will probably be difficult for you to live, right?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I’ve never tried that before…” Li Xuan was about to say something when he suddenly heard someone from the Wang family shouting in the yard.</p>
<p>“Third Aunt, what happened?” Wang Lu went out and stopped a woman.</p>
<p>“Someone challenged Ya, who is first on the rankings. Everyone is rushing to the cube to take a gander,” the middle-aged woman said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had almost forgotten about the ranking battle. He didn’t pay much attention to it.</p>
<p>It was mainly because he hadn’t advanced to the Mythical stage, so he didn’t plan on participating in the battle.</p>
<p>There didn’t seem to be much time left for the month-long countdown.</p>
<p>“You can go first. I have to check the space suits. I’ll rush over later.” Zhou Wen stayed behind alone as the others went to the cube to watch Ya’s battle.</p>
<p>“President Tang, does your company have accessories for oxygen, food, and water?” Zhou Wen asked Tang Zhizhong.</p>
<p>“Of course. We originally planned to make an industrial chain, but unfortunately, there are too few people who need these now. We have accumulated a lot of stock,” Tang Zhizhong said helplessly.</p>
<p>“Alright, send me all the equipment you produced. Don’t worry about the money. I won’t give you a single cent less than the asking price.” Zhou Wen was also preparing for the future.</p>
<p>Since there were dimensional creatures on the moon, Zhou Wen felt that there might be dimensional creatures on other planets. With Glimmer’s interstellar teleportation ability, he planned on visiting other planets in the future.</p>
<p>“The matching accessories can’t be sold. They are all stockpiled and aren’t worth much. If you want them, take them.” Tang Zhizhong wanted to do Zhou Wen a favor.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to give them to me for free. It’s fine as long as the items are good.” Zhou Wen naturally wasn’t someone who was greedy for small gains.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. Our company is professional in this aspect,” Tang Zhizhong said confidently.</p>
<p>After Tang Zhizhong and company left, Zhou Wen sent the space suits into the chaos space. Before long, Tang Zhizhong sent over compressed oxygen and other equipment.</p>
<p>The precision of the accessories left Zhou Wen somewhat surprised. The various equipment dazzled him. There were even some that were specially used to resolve the clearing of bowels.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only learned how to use most of the equipment after consulting Tang Zhizhong.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1040'>Chapter 1040: Tag-Team Battle</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>When Zhou Wen rushed to the cube, he saw Ya fighting a Guardian named Beast Deity.</p>
<p>Beast Deity held a huge stone hammer. Its strength was extremely powerful as it blasted away the Primordial Immortal Sword in Ya’s hand again and again.</p>
<p>Primordial Sword Immortal was the Primordial Immortal Sword in Ya’s hand. Its might was even stronger than Primordial Sword Immortal, but it failed to kill Beast Deity.</p>
<p>“Is Beast Deity that strong?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He had arrived a few hours later, but the battle was still continuing.</p>
<p>“That’s not the case,” Feng Qiuyan said excitedly. “That Ya is just too powerful. He has already defeated three Guardians consecutively. Beast Deity is already the fourth.”</p>
<p>“Fourth?” Zhou Wen frowned when he heard that.</p>
<p>“That’s right. That Ya is really too arrogant. He doesn’t rest at all. He accepts any challenge. Now, two of the four Guardians who challenged him have been severely injured and one has been killed. It looks like Beast Deity won’t be able to last much longer.” Li Xuan was envious and jealous.</p>
<p>“In that case, they clearly know that they aren’t a match for him, but they still challenge Ya?” Zhou Wen’s frown deepened.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that normal? Ya is in first place. Don’t all the Guardians have to vie for first place? What’s wrong with that?” Wang Chan asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head and didn’t say a word. All he did was look at Ya in battle.</p>
<p>Ya’s ability was really very strong. It wasn’t just strength, but his sword techniques were almost flawless. Even Zhou Wen, who had created the Heart Defying Sword himself, had to admit that Ya was definitely not inferior to him in sword techniques.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Ya wasn’t a person who solely relied on sword techniques like Zhou Wen. His various techniques reminded Zhou Wen of the Elegant Emperor Puppet’s Avatar Puppet in Tiger Cage Pass.</p>
<p>Could it be that Elegant Emperor is actually a Guardian? The Guardian that Zhong Ziya fused with is Elegant Emperor? Zhou Wen suspected that there was such a possibility.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had grinded Tiger Cage Pass so many times, but he had only seen Elegant Emperor’s Avatar Puppet. He had never seen Elegant Emperor’s true body. He still didn’t know what kind of existence Elegant Emperor was. Perhaps he was really a Guardian.</p>
<p>Beast Deity shattered Ya’s body with the hammer, but it was only a puppet avatar. The real Ya had already appeared behind Beast Deity and stabbed through his back where his heart was.</p>
<p>Beast Deity made a prompt decision. Despite being injured, he turned around and used an arm to block Primordial Immortal Sword’s attack. Then, he admitted defeat and left the cube’s arena, choosing not to fight to the death.</p>
<p>All across the Federation, the citizens and media were in an uproar. Ya had four consecutive victories. Such a result was definitely unprecedented. After all, no one had seen consecutive battles between Guardians in the past. Ya was considered the first.</p>
<p>There was no time for Ya to rest. Another Guardian challenged Ya, causing everyone to cheer again.</p>
<p>“Ya… Ya… Ya…” Many people waved their fists in excitement as they shouted Ya’s name, hoping for him to continue accepting the challenge.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. Although Guardians fought to clinch first place, there were actually Guardians who didn’t have this ability. There was no need for them to take the risk to participate in the battle. They could wait for the next opportunity.</p>
<p>After all, the ranking battles happened once a year. There was no need to be suicidal. They could wait.</p>
<p>However, the Guardians continued challenging Ya. It didn’t seem like they were trying to snatch first place. It was more like they were wearing Ya down.</p>
<p>Are the other Guardians joining forces to deal with Ya? Zhou Wen’s heart suddenly stirred as he seemed to think of something.</p>
<p>That’s not right. Ya is different from the other Guardians. The other Guardians had only contracted with humans. However, Ya has absorbed his Guardian. If that’s the case, can Ya still represent the Guardian’s race? If he can’t, there’ll be no dimensional race that can take over Earth if Ya wins. </p>
<p>The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that he was right. That’s right. The various races of the dimension absolutely can’t accept such a situation happening. Therefore, any Guardian can be the champion, but not Ya… This is why he has been continuously challenged…</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was somewhat worried. He didn’t know if Ya could hold on.</p>
<p>Even if he could hold on, the Guardians who really had a chance of obtaining first place were still secretly watching, ready to deliver a fatal blow at any time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had met Night Thearch, a fellow who had already advanced to the Terror grade. If he were to participate in the battle, Ya would be in even more danger.</p>
<p>Ya didn’t reject the challenge or even stall for time. He directly accepted another Guardian’s challenge.</p>
<p>He fought! He fought non-stop!</p>
<p>In front of the cubes all over the world were humans and even dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>The devils overseas were also paying attention to Ya’s battle, hoping to find his weakness.</p>
<p>However, despite Ya accepting the challenge of five Guardians in a row, no one could identify his weakness. This was because these five Guardians had been defeated by Ya in the same way.</p>
<p>Ya’s sword art combined with Primordial Immortal Sword possessed immense destructive power. Even Guardians found it difficult to resist it with their bodies.</p>
<p>However, this wasn’t the main reason for their defeat. The main reason was that they couldn’t tell if the person fighting them was Ya himself or his avatar.</p>
<p>Every time they fought with all their might, they would discover that the one fighting them was only a puppet avatar. The real Ya would suddenly appear and take their lives.</p>
<p>Sometimes, they couldn’t even tell if the person who injured them was Ya or an avatar.</p>
<p>It seemed that no one had ever made the right choice between the two, so no one could defeat Ya.</p>
<p>However, the challenge continued. There were still Guardians who wanted to challenge Ya.</p>
<p>They were determined to use a tag-team battle to defeat Ya. Just as Zhou Wen had guessed, anyone could be first, except Ya.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what Ya was thinking. He was still constantly accepting challenges. He didn’t even rest for a moment. After defeating a Guardian, he didn’t give himself any time to rest. As long as someone challenged him, he would always accept the challenge.</p>
<p>Something’s amiss! Zhou Wen looked at the battling Ya and found it odd.</p>
<p>Ya was crazy, but he didn’t give Zhou Wen the feeling that it was Zhong Ziya’s style.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya was arrogant and heretic, but he was definitely not a hot-blooded fool.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Wen could tell that his stamina and Essence Energy had decreased drastically, but he was still constantly accepting challenges. If Ya was really Zhong Ziya, he would definitely choose to have a good rest until the last moment before accepting the challenge. He would choose to fight in an optimal state.</p>
<p>What happened? Zhou Wen really wanted to rush into the arena and ask Ya if he was Zhong Ziya or what had happened.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen wasn’t a Mythical. He didn’t have the right to challenge anyone.</p>
<p>Wait a moment. Although I can’t enter the arena, my Companion Beast can. I just want to ask Ya. There’s no need to vie for first place. There’s no need to keep winning. Zhou Wen’s heart suddenly stirred.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1041'>Chapter 1041: 48 hours</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen decided to send a Companion Beast to challenge him.</p>
<p>This Companion Beast had to be known by Zhong Ziya. If Ya accepted this Companion Beast’s challenge, he might very well be Zhong Ziya.</p>
<p>Of course, as a matter of precaution, Zhou Wen wouldn’t sacrifice his main combat strength.</p>
<p>Which Companion Beast should I send to challenge him? After some thought, Zhou Wen couldn’t think of a suitable Companion Beast.</p>
<p>If he sent a main combat pet like Tyrant Behemoth, not only would Zhong Ziya know, but everyone knew that it was Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if Ya wasn’t Zhong Ziya, who knew what strange skills it would produce. If Tyrant Behemoth was killed, it would be a huge loss.</p>
<p>If he wasn’t afraid of Night Thearch and the other fellows who had already reached the Terror grade, it wouldn’t be a bad idea for Zhou Wen to send Demonic Neonate to vie for first place. However, Zhou Wen didn’t know how many Terror-grade existences were hidden in the shadows. He didn’t dare take such a risk.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen thought of a suitable Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Back when Zhong Ziya had used the Invisibility Cloak Companion Egg in exchange for Medusa’s dimensional crystal, not many people knew that the Invisibility Cloak was with Zhou Wen. Zhong Ziya was definitely one of them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Invisibility Cloak had its benefits. With three minutes of complete invisibility, it wasn’t easy to kill it. There was still time to surrender.</p>
<p>Another benefit was that ordinary people couldn’t see the Invisibility Cloak, nor would they know that his Companion Beast was challenging it. This made it much easier.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen summoned the Invisibility Cloak and made it float towards the cube.</p>
<p>As the Invisibility Cloak was invisible to begin with, no one could see him. Only some top experts could use some special methods to sense the existence of the Invisibility Cloak.</p>
<p>However, everyone’s attention was focused on the battle between Ya and the other Guardians. No one noticed the Invisibility Cloak’s arrival.</p>
<p>Ya was indeed very strong, but the continuous battles had drained him greatly. It was obvious that his strength and speed were decreasing.</p>
<p>Even so, the Guardian was still defeated by Ya. However, anyone could tell that Ya’s dominance was plummeting and wasn’t seemingly invincible as before.</p>
<p>The moment the Guardian admitted defeat, someone else issued a challenge.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, Zhou Wen got the Invisibility Cloak to issue a challenge. The light from the Imperial Capital’s cube shot into the sky, shocking everyone.</p>
<p>“Who is it? Who issued the challenge here? Does our Imperial Capital have Guardians joining the battle?”</p>
<p>“Strange, why can’t I see anyone? Who’s issuing the challenge?”</p>
<p>“I don’t see a thing. Where is it?”</p>
<p>As everyone was bewildered, the words “Invisibility Cloak Challenges Ya” appeared on the cube’s screen. However, they still couldn’t see it. On the cube’s screen, the Invisibility Cloak remained invisible.</p>
<p>“Invisibility Cloak… Someone actually rehatched the Invisibility Cloak. However, this should be a Companion Beast, right?”</p>
<p>“A single Companion Beast actually dares to challenge a Guardian. Isn’t he a little too confident? Even if he has invisibility, it’s impossible for him to beat Ya, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. Although the Invisibility Cloak’s invisibility is powerful, its offensive power isn’t strong. I’m afraid it can’t even break through the Guardian’s armor.”</p>
<p>“It’s useless saying so much. Ya probably won’t accept Invisibility Cloak’s challenge. With so many Guardians challenging him, he should view such a Companion Beast with contempt.”</p>
<p>Everyone felt that it made sense, but then the cubes around the world lit up. Two names appeared at the same time—Ya and Invisibility Cloak.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, Ya actually accepted Invisibility Cloak’s challenge!”</p>
<p>“What’s Ya doing? Fighting a Companion Beast? From the looks of it, he’s really tired. He wants to use this opportunity to rest, right?”</p>
<p>Everyone felt that Ya had accepted the Invisibility Cloak’s challenge because he wanted to rest.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was overjoyed when he saw that the Invisibility Cloak had been chosen.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Ya is most likely Zhong Ziya. As Zhou Wen pondered, the Invisibility Cloak had already entered the void’s cube arena through the tunnel on the cube.</p>
<p>Ya remained standing in the cube’s arena, holding Primordial Immortal Sword in his hand. He didn’t show any emotions as though he didn’t recognize the Invisibility Cloak.</p>
<p>Is this fellow Zhong Ziya? Zhou Wen was somewhat unsure because in Ya’s eyes, there was only an infinite fighting spirit.</p>
<p>In the next second, Ya had already pulled out Primordial Immortal Sword and stabbed at the Invisibility Cloak.</p>
<p>The ordinary invisibility ability of Invisibility Cloak was clearly useless in front of Ya.</p>
<p>Ya’s strike was fast and ruthless. It was even more ferocious than the last battle.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to order Invisibility Cloak to use its complete invisibility ability. The Invisibility Cloak’s form vanished as Ya’s strike passed through it, failing to injure it.</p>
<p>When Primordial Immortal Sword passed through the Invisibility Cloak, Zhou Wen suddenly discovered a strange fluctuation in it. He couldn’t help but be alarmed.</p>
<p>Could it be that Ya has the ability to see through invisibility? As Zhou Wen was thinking, he suddenly saw Ya’s body dissipate like a stream of light after passing through the Invisibility Cloak. He then disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>What skill is this? Is it also invisibility? Zhou Wen was momentarily taken aback.</p>
<p>When he saw the scene on the cube again, he was stunned.</p>
<p>On the cube screens around the world, Ya, who was ranked first, fell from first place for the first time. Replacing him was Zhou Wen’s Invisibility Cloak.</p>
<p>This time, it wasn’t just Zhou Wen. Everyone was stunned, unsure what was happening.</p>
<p>In Invisibility Cloak’s challenge of Ya, Ya had only struck once before admitting defeat.</p>
<p>Since they couldn’t see the Invisibility Cloak, they could only see Ya strike. They didn’t know how Ya lost or why he admitted defeat.</p>
<p>“That’s impossible, right? A Companion Beast can actually defeat a Guardian? And it’s a Guardian like Ya?”</p>
<p>“What the hell. A Companion Beast actually took first place!”</p>
<p>“Something must be going on. An absolute scam. I spent all my money betting on Ya to win and now I’ve lost everything. My savings are all gone. Boohoo.”</p>
<p>“Brother, gambling isn’t good. Don’t worry. Calm down and pay your debts. I’ll do the honors of taking care of your wife.”</p>
<p>The Guardians who were about to challenge Ya were stunned when they saw Ya lose and give up his first spot. They were momentarily stunned and didn’t know if they should continue.</p>
<p>Should they challenge the first place—Invisibility Cloak—or Ya, who had already fallen to second place?</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had already sensed that something was amiss with the Invisibility Cloak. There was a line of words written on the inside of the Invisibility Cloak.</p>
<p>“Help me occupy first place and I’ll rush back in 48 hours. You must not lose first place. Otherwise, I’ll lose my life… Zhong Ziya…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know how the line was written, but there was no doubt that Ya was Zhong Ziya.</p>
<p>48 hours… You think too highly of me… Zhou Wen didn’t know what had happened, but it wasn’t an easy task to occupy first place on the rankings for 48 hours.</p>
<p>Now, the preparation time for all challenges had been shortened to an hour. In 48 hours, Zhou Wen had to accept the challenge forty-eight times. Furthermore, the same challenger couldn’t challenge another a second time within a day.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1042'>Chapter 1042: Rigged Match</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>After a moment of collective silence among the Guardians, a Guardian immediately challenged the Invisibility Cloak.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t accept it. The Invisibility Cloak’s supplementary effects were very strong, but its actual lethality wasn’t much. In a battle with a Guardian, there was basically no chance of victory.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and company knew that Zhou Wen had the Invisibility Cloak and looked at him with odd expressions. However, it was difficult to say it out loud where they were.</p>
<p>“Wang Lu, other than here, is there a cube where there are fewer people?” Zhou Wen asked Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“Yes, but there are many dimensional creatures in the uninhabited area outside the Imperial Capital,” Wang Lu said after some thought.</p>
<p>“Can we get there in an hour?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“You have to be fast enough. At the very least, you have to be at the Mythical stage. Furthermore, you can’t be delayed on the trip there.” Wang Lu didn’t hesitate and immediately answered Zhou Wen’s question.</p>
<p>“Alright, give me the address.” Zhou Wen’s speed was comparable to a Mythical.</p>
<p>“That place isn’t easy to find. I’ll take you there,” Wang Lu said as she summoned a huge white cat.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen carried Ya’er and sat behind Wang Lu. After informing Li Xuan and company, Wang Lu rode the white cat away.</p>
<p>It was definitely not an easy task to maintain first place for two days. Zhou Wen couldn’t let the Invisibility Cloak fight, so he could only challenge himself and drag out the next two days.</p>
<p>As the Companion Beasts that could issue challenges had to be at the Mythical stage or had the qualifications to advance to the Mythical stage, it was impossible to use ordinary Companion Beasts to stall for time. Zhou Wen calculated that if he summoned all his Mythical Companion Beasts, he could last for twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>He needed many Mythical Companion Beasts to survive a day of challenges without repeats.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen had quite a number of Mythical Companion Beasts, so it shouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p>Wang Lu’s white cat was actually a Mythical Companion Beast. It was rather fast as it ran on the main road of the Imperial Capital and quickly left the city.</p>
<p>There were many dimensional zones near the Imperial Capital. The white cat ran quickly and didn’t encounter any dimensional creatures along the way.</p>
<p>After more than forty minutes, the white cat had reached the ancient town that no one lived in. There was a cube in the town.</p>
<p>“We’re here.” Wang Lu controlled the white cat to stop in front of the cube.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that there were many dimensional creatures nearby?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled. He didn’t see any dimensional creatures nearby.</p>
<p>“I naturally won’t see them if I don’t want to encounter them,” Wang Lu said with a wink.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was enlightened. It was because of Wang Lu’s Luck stat.</p>
<p>“Thankfully, I have you. Otherwise, I don’t know if I would’ve made it in time if I were intercepted by a dimensional creature.” Zhou Wen looked at the countdown. There was less than ten minutes left. He hurriedly summoned a Golden Battle God Halberd and got it to challenge the Invisibility Cloak.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the time and wasn’t in a rush to accept the challenge. He wanted to wait until the last second and not waste a single second. After all, it wouldn’t be easy to last the forty-eight hours.</p>
<p>People from all over the world were waiting for the Invisibility Cloak to accept the challenge, but as time passed, the Invisibility Cloak remained motionless. The countdown was about to end.</p>
<p>“The Invisibility Cloak won’t automatically forfeit, right?”</p>
<p>“It’s very possible. Although the Invisibility Cloak is strong, it’s only a support-type Companion Beast. Its combat strength isn’t strong. Even if it accepts a challenge, it’s impossible for it to be the Guardian’s match.”</p>
<p>“Have you forgotten that the Invisibility Cloak defeated Ya?”</p>
<p>“That’s just a coincidence. I think Ya fought the Guardians with all his might previously and was already at the end of his rope. That’s why the Invisibility Cloak benefited.”</p>
<p>“You can’t say that. We aren’t sure if the Invisibility Cloak has powerful offensive abilities. Perhaps it does.”</p>
<p>As everyone was discussing, there were only ten seconds left on the countdown. As they watched the time pass, their hearts leaped to their throats.</p>
<p>“It looks like the Invisibility Cloak is about to give up on accepting the challenge.” The countdown was already at 1. Another tick and it would be over.</p>
<p>To everyone’s surprise, the screen suddenly lit up.</p>
<p>“The Invisibility Cloak has accepted the challenge… Whose challenge? Holy sh*t… Golden Battle God Halberd… Another Companion Beast…”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>“Why does it feel like I’ve returned to the previous ranking battle? This is too retro.”</p>
<p>“Golden Battle God Halberd. I think it’s a Mythical Companion Beast from the West District. Can it defeat the Invisibility Cloak?”</p>
<p>Seeing the Golden Battle God Halberd appear on the cube and float in midair, everyone looked forward to a huge battle.</p>
<p>Although everyone knew that the Golden Battle God Halberd’s strength was definitely inferior to a Guardian’s, they were still very curious as to what skills the Invisibility Cloak had.</p>
<p>Countless pairs of eyes stared at the cube’s screen. They waited for a while, but there was no reaction. They waited for a little while longer, but there was still no reaction.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? Is the video stuck?” someone asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“This is a cube, not a live stream. How can it be stuck?” someone said.</p>
<p>“If it’s not stuck, why isn’t the screen moving?”</p>
<p>“I think… Perhaps… Perhaps… the Golden Battle God Halberd hasn’t moved?”</p>
<p>“It can’t see the Invisibility Cloak at all. What can it do? It’s staying motionless to deal with any possible change.”</p>
<p>“But it can’t just stay still.”</p>
<p>“It’s impossible for the Invisibility Cloak to remain hidden forever. The Golden Battle God Halberd is waiting for an opportunity.”</p>
<p>As everyone watched the frozen scene, they discussed how the Golden Battle God Halberd could find the Invisibility Cloak.</p>
<p>More than half an hour passed. The Golden Battle God Halberd remained motionless like a mountain, and they couldn’t see where the Invisibility Cloak was.</p>
<p>At that moment, people began to feel that something was amiss. “Holy sh*t, this can’t be a rigged match, right? Don’t tell me the Golden Battle God Halberd and Invisibility Cloak belong to the same person?”</p>
<p>“I think it’s very likely. Otherwise, how could they remain motionless?”</p>
<p>“A blatant rigged match. How shameless.”</p>
<p>After waiting for a while, the Golden Battle God Halberd and Invisibility Cloak still had no intention of moving. Everyone had already realized that this was definitely a rigged match.</p>
<p>“If this continues, won’t they be able to last until the end of the ranking battle? Then, the first place on the rankings will definitely be chosen between the Invisibility Cloak and the Golden Battle God Halberd.”</p>
<p>“This is too shameless. I wonder who could do such a thing. It’s a disgrace to the Federation.”</p>
<p>Be it the Federation or overseas, they hated such actions. Instead, the Guardians didn’t panic and continued waiting patiently.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sat in front of the cube and played with his phone. He wanted to while away the forty-eight hours like this.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the heavens didn’t listen to his wishes. On the cube’s arena, a blinding light suddenly appeared as though there was life inside.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1043'>Chapter 1043: Showing Off Pets</h3>
<p>1</p>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>This blob of dazzling light was none other than the one who had announced the beginning of the Battle of Guardians. His sudden appearance was clearly because of the Invisibility Cloak and the Golden Battle God Halberd’s rigged match.</p>
<p>The creature in the light slowly said, “From now on, battles between all Companion Beasts have to be decided within an hour. If it exceeds the time limit, both sides will be eliminated. In the final ranking battle for first place, there will be unlimited single challenges. There’s no time limit for the battle. As long as a Guardian challenges, the person in first place has to accept the challenge until no Guardian challenges them again.”</p>
<p>With that said, the dazzling creature vanished into the void. In the cube’s arena, a huge number appeared. It was a three-minute countdown.</p>
<p>“Haha, serves you right for rigging the match. Even the dimensional creatures can’t stand it.”</p>
<p>“Dream on if you believe you can use tricks to win. Does he treat dimensional creatures as fools?”</p>
<p>“Are you dumbfounded now? You can only stall for three minutes at most.”</p>
<p>“The Invisibility Cloak and Golden Battle God Halberd sure did well. They actually forced the Battle of Guardians to change the rules.”</p>
<p>Although everyone discussed spiritedly, Zhou Wen wasn’t filled with anxiety. He hadn’t had any hopes that a single Companion Beast could last forty-eight hours.</p>
<p>I can drag it out for an hour before the challenge, but I can also drag it out for an hour during the battle. In that case, I only need twelve Mythical Companion Beasts to drag it out for twenty-four hours. When the time comes, I’ll repeat them again, allowing me to drag it out for forty-eight hours, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t waste any time as he waited for the three-minute countdown to end.</p>
<p>Everyone believed that Zhou Wen was in a difficult position to make a choice. Only at the last second did the Invisibility Cloak automatically admit defeat, allowing the Golden Battle God Halberd to occupy first place.</p>
<p>“The Golden Battle God Halberd actually took first place. What a joke.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. It won’t stay up there for long. The Guardians will quickly chase it down.”</p>
<p>“Do you think that person will still have Mythical Companion Beasts to afford his continual challenging of himself?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. You heard the rules the dimensional creature mentioned. Infinite challenges. This trick is useless. He won’t get first place.”</p>
<p>“Invisibility Cloak and Golden Battle God Halberd are both Companion Beasts from the West District, right? I wonder which family in the West District would do such a shameless thing.”</p>
<p>Seeing that the Golden Battle God Halberd hadn’t accepted the challenge, everyone guessed that it would be dragged to the last second again.</p>
<p>They wanted to see how the Golden Battle God Halberd would be defeated. Although they knew that this was the case, no one left.</p>
<p>After waiting for an hour, there was only one second left to accept the challenge. The arena lit up as the Golden Battle God Halberd accepted the challenge.</p>
<p>“Demon Blood True Dragon, another Companion Beast! Don’t tell me it’s the same person?”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Everyone saw a black dragon appear on the cube’s arena, confronting the Golden Battle God Halberd.</p>
<p>However, after a long confrontation, they still didn’t make a move.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, again? Is this person crazy? What’s the point of doing something so useless?”</p>
<p>“Did the embarrassment get to him? It’s clearly impossible to get first place this way, yet he insists on doing this.”</p>
<p>Everyone was very displeased with this act of time stalling, but there was nothing they could do.</p>
<p>Now, they didn’t need to watch to know the outcome. It would definitely be another case of one side admitting defeat at the last second.</p>
<p>Indeed, things went as they expected. At the last second, the Demon Blood True Dragon admitted defeat, allowing Golden Battle God Halberd to remain in first place.</p>
<p>Then, there was another hour of long waiting. Now, everyone knew that it was impossible for the owner of the Golden Battle God Halberd to accept the challenge without dragging it to the last second.</p>
<p>Finally, after waiting for another hour, the Golden Battle God Halberd accepted a challenge. However, the challenger was another Demon Blood True Dragon.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“What the hell is this? Didn’t the Demon Blood True Dragon already go on stage? Isn’t it said that the same Companion Beast can only challenge once a day? Why is it here again?”</p>
<p>“That’s not right. This isn’t the same one. Look carefully. Behind the Demon Blood True Dragon, there’s a tiny Kun character. This one doesn’t have it.”</p>
<p>“It’s true. So it’s not the same one. This person is too shameless. Anyway, he will still lose in the end. Why waste everyone’s time?”</p>
<p>The spectators were very displeased, but Zhou Wen remained indifferent as he continued stalling for time.</p>
<p>Two hours later, another Demon Blood True Dragon entered the cube arena. Four hours later, another Demon Blood True Dragon entered the cube arena.</p>
<p>In the beginning, there were still people complaining, but now, no one was complaining.</p>
<p>“Four True Blood Demon Dragons. These are all Mythical Companion Beasts. Together with the Golden Battle God Halberd and Concealment, there are already six Mythical Companion Beasts. Do you think these Mythical Companion Beasts belong to one person or a family clan?”</p>
<p>“The possibility of a family clan is higher, right? It’s rare for a person to have so many Mythical Companion Beasts.”</p>
<p>“I think they might be owned by one person.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In Luoyang’s Overseer Manor, An Sheng and An Tianzuo were watching the live broadcast.</p>
<p>“The fourth Demon Blood True Dragon. Don’t tell me Young Master Wen has already gathered the nine Demon Blood True Dragons that pull the carriage?” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“It’s already lucky to have four. It’s unlikely there will be any more,” An Tianzuo said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen’s luck seems pretty good, so it’s hard to say.” An Sheng disagreed with An Tianzuo’s view.</p>
<p>“What’s there to be unsure about? Luck has its limitations,” An Tianzuo said expressionlessly.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It was unknown if there was some unknown force affecting the turn of events, but just as An Tianzuo finished speaking, Zhou Wen, who was farming his dungeons, had another Demon Dragon True Dragon Companion Egg drop.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was originally still fretting over what Companion Beast to use for battle, but now, he didn’t have to worry about it. He hatched the fifth True Blood Demon Dragon and waited for the time to be up.</p>
<p>“It’s the fifth one… There’s really a fifth one… How is this a duel? It’s simply showing off Companion Beasts!”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“If the owners of these Companion Beasts are the same person, it will be terrifying.”</p>
<p>“I wonder if there will be another Dragon Blood True Dragon. From the words at the back, it seems to be arranged according to the Eight Trigrams. There should be a total of eight, right?”</p>
<p>“How can it be so easy to gather them? I want to see how many Mythical Companion Beasts that person has.”</p>
<p>People who were originally very displeased with this kind of rigged match hoped to see how many Mythical Companion Beasts the owner of the Golden Battle God Halberd would have.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Overseer, it’s the fifth one,” An Sheng reported softly.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“I can see that,” An Tianzuo said expressionlessly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1044'>Chapter 1044: Queen Mother Fox Immortal</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Do you think there will be a sixth Demon Blood True Dragon?”</p>
<p>“It can’t be that crazy, right? Even if there are really eight Eight-Trigram True Dragons, who has such good luck to have all eight Demon Blood True Dragons drop?”</p>
<p>“To have five drops is already crazy luck.”</p>
<p>There were still many resourceful people in the Federation’s media. During this period of time, someone had already investigated all the Companion Beasts that had appeared.</p>
<p>The Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau was a rather famous media outlet in the Federation. They had already created a column that specifically introduced these Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Not only did it introduce the origins of the Golden Battle God Halberd, but it also dug up the origins of the Invisibility Cloak and the story of the Invisibility Cloak.</p>
<p>Only then did people realize that the Invisibility Cloak had returned to its Companion Egg form after hatching. Almost no one could hatch it again.</p>
<p>What was even stranger was that after the Invisibility Cloak was won in an auction, it had actually been stolen. Up to now, no one knew who had the Invisibility Cloak.</p>
<p>The origins of the Demon Blood True Dragon had been dug out by them, causing widespread discussion.</p>
<p>Although they couldn’t see a battle, this didn’t reduce their enjoyment at all. Many people read the reports while waiting.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, it’s awesome. There are a total of nine Demon Blood True Dragons, and they are in the terrifying Zhuolu underground sea. What kind of powerful existence can kill the nine Demon Blood True Dragons and have five Companion Beasts drop?”</p>
<p>“I think this was definitely done by a family. It can’t be just one person.”</p>
<p>“According to the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau’s report, the combat strength of these nine Demon Blood True Dragons is extremely terrifying. I haven’t heard of anyone being able to fight them alone.”</p>
<p>“The Golden Battle God Halberd of the West District and the Demon Blood True Dragon of the East District. How powerful are the people who have them?”</p>
<p>“It’s definitely not one person. It must be a family.”</p>
<p>“The six families haven’t indicated that this matter has anything to do with them. I have a feeling that the person who has these Companion Beasts might be a person.”</p>
<p>“Compared to who has these Companion Beasts, I want to know what kind of Companion Beast will appear next. Will it be another Demon Blood True Dragon?”</p>
<p>People were discussing who the person who had these Companion Beasts was. They were divided into two factions that argued incessantly. Most people believed that the entity who had these Companion Beasts was definitely a large family clan.</p>
<p>Even if it wasn’t an existence like the six families, it was definitely a powerhouse.</p>
<p>A portion of them were discussing if the people with these Companion Beasts were from the East or West District. This was because up to now, the Companion Beasts used came from the East and West District.</p>
<p>Amidst the discussions and arguments, two hours passed. Everyone punctually waited in front of the cube or the live broadcast, hoping to see a new Companion Beast appear.</p>
<p>Indeed, at the last second, the Golden Battle God Halberd accepted the challenge again. However, this time, the challenger that appeared on the cube was no longer the Demon Blood True Dragon.</p>
<p>It was an extremely beautiful girl with mesmerizing eyes and long hair. Just a glance at her made one feel like they were in love.</p>
<p>“Medusa… It’s actually Medusa… Furthermore, it’s Medusa in her maiden form…”</p>
<p>“I heard that ever since the Curse Demon Palace was discovered, many experts wanted to have Medusa drop. Some people killed Medusa, but up to now, no one has heard of anyone dropping a Medusa Companion Beast.”</p>
<p>“I knew it. The owner of the Golden Battle God Halberd is definitely from our West District.”</p>
<p>“Maiden Medusa is really beautiful. I really like this Companion Beast.”</p>
<p>“Purchasing her for one hundred million Federation coins!”</p>
<p>“It’s this Medusa that’s cute. She’s too terrifying when she transforms into a demoness.”</p>
<p>“I’m willing to use ten years of my lifespan to exchange for a day with Medusa.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>The videos and pictures of the young Medusa quickly became popular in the entire Federation because she was just so beautiful.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still in town playing cards with Wang Lu and company. Feng Qiuyan and Li Xuan had already rushed over, but their journey wasn’t that smooth. They encountered many powerful dimensional creatures and had to storm their way to the town.</p>
<p>The few of them had nothing to do in the town, so Zhou Wen took out a table and cards. They played cards in front of the cube, but after a few rounds, they found it boring.</p>
<p>There were clearly four people playing cards, but only Wang Lu won. It was really meaningless.</p>
<p>“You guys have fun. I’ll take a walk nearby. I can increase my combat experience,” Feng Qiuyan said as he stood up.</p>
<p>He wasn’t afraid of losing, but playing cards wasn’t fun for him. He might as well practice his saber.</p>
<p>Li Xuan also brushed off the matter with a laugh. “This card game is really boring. You don’t need to look at the cards to know that you will lose. No matter how good the cards are, you won’t win. I’m not playing anymore.”</p>
<p>Wang Lu said helplessly, “I can’t do anything about that. I can’t control my Life Providence.”</p>
<p>“Is there anything interesting around here?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>Wang Lu thought for a moment and said, “There’s a Fox Immortal Temple nearby. It worships Queen Mother Fox Immortal. I heard that as long as you offer her incense, she can fulfill a wish.”</p>
<p>“For real? Then can I make a wish for a Mythical Companion Beast or a Guardian?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“Of course… not…” Wang Lu said with a smile,” In fact, there’s only one wish that Queen Mother Fox Immortal can satisfy. That is to temporarily improve your luck. During this period of time, if you kill dimensional creatures, the chances of a Companion Egg dropping will be higher.”</p>
<p>“There’s actually such a good thing? How long can this effect last?” Li Xuan was interested.</p>
<p>“It’s variable. It depends on the person. Some people only enjoy it for a short period of time. It might be about ten minutes or an hour. There are also those who have a longer period of time. Their luck will be better the entire day. However, typically speaking, it will only be effective on the day. After midnight, the luck augmentation will definitely disappear.”</p>
<p>Wang Lu paused for a moment before saying, “Furthermore, it’s only useful to offer incense on the fifteenth day of the lunar calendar. Our luck is pretty good. Today is the fifteenth. We can go there to take a look.”</p>
<p>“Is it far?” Zhou Wen was very interested when he heard that. If the augmentation of Fox Immortal Temple was really useful, his efficiency at grinding Companion Beasts in-game would increase significantly.</p>
<p>“With our speed, we can reach there in twenty minutes at most,” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>“Then let’s go take a look together.” Zhou Wen looked at the time. There was probably enough time.</p>
<p>Under Wang Lu’s lead, the group quickly arrived at Fox Immortal Temple. It was also a dimensional zone, but it was very small. It was only a tiny temple.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1045'>Chapter 1045: Lingering Fear</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The tiny Fox Immortal Temple didn’t even have a yard wall. Although it was called a temple, it was actually a small house made of stone. The door was only half the height of an ordinary door. If one wanted to enter, they had to bend very low.</p>
<p>The temple was very simple. There were almost no decorations. The rocks used to build the temple were uneven and very crude.</p>
<p>There was an offering table made of stone in the temple. On the offering table was an ancient wooden tablet with the words “Queen Mother Fox Immortal” engraved on it.</p>
<p>“Wait a moment. There’s still a taboo when entering Fox Immortal Temple. You have to kneel and enter. Otherwise, what you obtain won’t be good luck, but bad luck,” Wang Lu hurriedly said when she saw Li Xuan about to enter.</p>
<p>“So be it. It’s not embarrassing to kneel in front of Queen Mother Fox Immortal. It’s fine if she bestows me some luck later.” Li Xuan was open-minded. He walked to the temple and plopped to his knees.</p>
<p>One had to admit that they could only enter the tiny temple while kneeling. Li Xuan had to lower his head to enter even while kneeling. There was no way he could enter while standing.</p>
<p>When inside the temple, Li Xuan lit the three incense sticks Zhou Wen had given him. He bowed at Queen Mother Fox Immortal’s tablet before inserting the three incense sticks into the incense burner.</p>
<p>At that moment, a purple gas immediately rose from the Queen Mother Fox Immortal’s tablet. The purple gas circled above Li Xuan’s head and landed on his forehead, forming a circular blurry pattern. It looked like a fox with its head and tail connected.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Is that all? Has my luck increased?” Li Xuan left Fox Immortal Temple and asked Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“It has already increased. I don’t know how long it’s effective though. When the symbol on your forehead disappears, that’s when time is up,” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>“Then let’s not waste any time. Little Yanyan, quickly go in and pay your respects. Let’s try our luck by going out and killing some dimensional creatures.” Li Xuan urged Feng Qiuyan to enter.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan took three incense sticks and mimicked Li Xuan. He entered while kneeling and bowed.</p>
<p>The outcome was the same. A purple gas rushed out from the tablet, but the amount of purple gas was much greater than Li Xuan’s. The pattern formed was also clearer. One could already see the fox’s facial features. It wasn’t as blurry as Li Xuan’s. Even its face couldn’t be seen clearly.</p>
<p>“Why is mine a little different?” Li Xuan asked as he looked at the symbol on Feng Qiuyan’s forehead.</p>
<p>“The clearer the pattern, the stronger and longer the luck augmentation,” Wang Lu explained.</p>
<p>“This is discrimination. Why are Little Yanyan’s effects better than mine when we both bowed?” Li Xuan said gloomily.</p>
<p>“Because you’re ugly,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Since you are beautiful, why don’t you give it a try? You might even be worse than me,” Li Xuan said with a twitch of his lips.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also wanted to know if Queen Mother Fox Immortal’s luck augmentation was effective in-game. Therefore, he took out three more incense sticks and walked to the front of Fox Immortal Temple. Then, he mimicked Li Xuan and knelt in front of the door.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The tablet in Fox Immortal Temple suddenly seemed to be blasted away as it fell from the offering table. After falling to the ground, it split into two.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the incense sticks in a daze as he looked at the two halves of the tablet on the ground.</p>
<p>“This… Can it still be used?” Zhou Wen wanted to enter again to give it a try, but just as his knees moved and he ended up moving half a step into the temple, the two halves of the Queen Mother Fox Immortal tablet on the ground immediately exploded into fragments.</p>
<p>Seeing this situation, Zhou Wen knew that it was definitely useless. All he could do was stand up with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan and Wang Lu looked at Zhou Wen with odd expressions. Li Xuan didn’t react much, having seen this happen before.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, from the looks of it, you aren’t fated to be augmented by a god in this life. Don’t be so awesome in your next life. It’s not a good thing to be too awesome,” Li Xuan consoled Zhou Wen as he patted him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was exasperated as well. He knew that his Life Providence was up to no good, but there was nothing he could do about it. Most temples needed a bow, but a bow from him resulted in something bad, so he couldn’t gain anything from it.</p>
<p>“Forget it. I’m going back.” Zhou Wen hadn’t received the augmentation, nor had he found the tiny palm symbol. He planned on rushing back to the town’s cube with Wang Lu.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan and Li Xuan went to kill dimensional creatures together. They weren’t interested in watching Zhou Wen flaunt his Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hadn’t walked far before he suddenly thought of something. He got Wang Lu to return to Fox Immortal Temple before switching to the Supreme Hell King Life Soul to take a look from afar.</p>
<p>With a glance, he realized that there was a purple Spirit Qi rising in the tiny temple. It was like a transparent purple fox had entrenched itself in the temple as it stared at Zhou Wen in surprise and puzzlement.</p>
<p>This thing… Does it count as a dimensional creature? Zhou Wen looked at the spirit body fox. Under normal circumstances, humans couldn’t see such a pure spirit body creature.</p>
<p>Only the Supreme Hell King Life Soul allowed Zhou Wen to see these things.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned a Golden Battle God Halberd and made it fly towards the fox’s spirit body.</p>
<p>However, the Golden Battle God Halberd directly flew out of the fox’s spirit body and failed to injure it. The fox only stared at Zhou Wen fiercely, but it seemed to be afraid of something. It didn’t dare attack him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the Light Concealment Sword and Night Immaculate Sword. He also tried several Companion Beasts and realized that their attacks were useless against the fox in its spirit body state.</p>
<p>The fox only looked at Zhou Wen without any intention of attacking him.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Wang Lu looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement.</p>
<p>She couldn’t see the fox’s spirit body. All she saw was Zhou Wen using all sorts of Companion Beasts to constantly attack the air above the temple. She imagined that he had offended Queen Mother Fox Immortal and had been cursed.</p>
<p>“Nothing.” Zhou Wen saw that ordinary Companion Beast attacks were useless against the fox, so he called out Ice Maiden in the Chaos Bead.</p>
<p>After coming out, she stared at the temple. Ice Maiden could clearly see the fox’s spirit body.</p>
<p>When the fox saw Ice Maiden, it immediately bared its teeth and stared at her as though it was afraid of her.</p>
<p>Could the fox in this temple really be a Terror-grade creature? Zhou Wen had only guessed it previously, but now that he saw Queen Mother Fox Immortal staring at Ice Maiden, he was even more certain.</p>
<p>If Queen Mother Fox Immortal is a Terror creature, wouldn’t the Earth Lord in the Earth Temple or the mountain gods of the Mountain God Temple be Terror-grade creatures?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression turned odd. Although it was somewhat surprising that there was a Terror-grade creature in the temple, what really surprised him was that his Life Providence could smash a Terror-grade creature’s tablet. Furthermore, the Terror-grade creature didn’t do anything to him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a lingering fear when he thought about it. If the Terror creatures had really attacked him, wouldn’t he have lost his life long ago?</p>

<p>“Ice Maiden, is that a Terror Creature?” Zhou Wen asked Ice Maiden.</p>
<p>“Yes, but it’s a little different from the dimension’s Terror creatures. It should be a Terror-grade creature born on Earth,” Ice Maiden said.</p>
<p>“Are you confident?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I’d be confident if I had the Heaven Shrouding Bell in hand,” Ice Maiden said expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.” Zhou Wen turned around and left, dispelling his desire to fight.</p>
<p>The Heaven Shrouding Bell had already fused with Demonic Neonate. He couldn’t even take it back, much less return it to Ice Maiden.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there wasn’t much time left. He had to get Medusa to admit defeat when he returned. Otherwise, the two Companion Beasts would be eliminated. After this matter was settled, he would study the fox.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden didn’t wish to return to the Chaos Bead again, so she followed Zhou Wen and company back to the town.</p>
<p>Seeing that the countdown was almost up, Zhou Wen was considering which Companion Beast to send to stall for another two hours.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen thought about it, everyone in the world guessed what the next Companion Beast would be.</p>
<p>Even the six families and overseas devils were studying Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts. At the same time, they were guessing who the owner of these Companion Beasts was.</p>
<p>This was because other than the Golden Battle God Halberd, Medusa, and the Invisibility Cloak, few people had seen the other Companion Beasts, much less know of their abilities.</p>
<p>However, having so many Companion Beasts gathered in the hands of one person or faction was a very terrifying matter. It was worth their attention. They also secretly guessed who had these Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, none of the Companion Beasts fought after they entered the arena. They had no chance of studying them.</p>
<p>As everyone waited, Medusa also admitted defeat and left. A new round of challenges began.</p>
<p>When the time allocated to the challenges ended, a Companion Beast named Ancient Splitting Tadpole appeared on the cube’s arena. Everyone looked at each other because no one had seen such a Companion Beast before, much less know what abilities it had.</p>
<p>“Who knows which district the Ancient Splitting Tadpole belongs to?” the chief editor of the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau asked as he scanned the entire studio.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at each other. They couldn’t even tell which district the Companion Beast came from.</p>
<p>“Investigate. Investigate immediately. Think of all ways. No matter what, we have to investigate the origins of the Ancient Splitting Tadpole before our competitors,” the chief editor said fiercely.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the Freedom Investigation Bureau. In fact, the various families were trying to investigate the origins of the Ancient Splitting Tadpole. All sorts of intelligence agencies began working hard.</p>
<p>However, a place like the Valley of No Return was somewhere even the locals of the South District didn’t dare approach. Not many people knew that there were Splitting Tadpoles inside, much less a Mythical Ancient Splitting Tadpole.</p>
<p>Some people who had entered the Valley of No Return and were lucky enough to come out alive had seen the typical Splitting Tadpole, but the typical Splitting Tadpole was very different from Zhou Wen’s.</p>
<p>In the end, it was a news reporter from the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau stationed in the South District. He remembered seeing a photo of a Mythical Ancient Splitting Tadpole in a native’s home.</p>
<p>The reporter hurriedly ran over and realized that the dimensional creature in the photo was indeed identical to the Ancient Splitting Tadpole. After repeated questioning, he learned the origins of the photo.</p>
<p>In less than an hour, the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau once again reported the origins of the Ancient Splitting Tadpole.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, a Mythical Companion Beast from a place like the Valley of No Return…” People who knew about the Valley of No Return gasped when they saw the report.</p>
<p>“This time, it’s another Companion Beast from the South District. Now, I can confirm that the person with these Companion Beasts is definitely from a large faction. It’s impossible for a person to do it alone. How can a person have so much time and energy to go to so many places and hunt so many Mythical Companion Beasts?”</p>
<p>“I think it’s highly likely that one of the six families is behind the scenes. How can a family clan have such immense strength to cross different districts to hunt Mythical creatures?”</p>
<p>Now, everyone was extremely interested in these Companion Beasts. They no longer had their previous contempt.</p>
<p>As for the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau, they also published an article, “If these Companion Beasts belong to the same person”. The article proposed a hypothesis. If these Companion Beasts belonged to the same human, what would happen if this human participated in the ranking battle.</p>
<p>This article didn’t provide a conclusion, but it did a lot of analysis.</p>
<p>The so-called Guardians were actually at the Mythical stage, but they were slightly stronger than the typical Mythical creature. Typical Mythical Companion Beasts weren’t their match.</p>
<p>As for the owners of Guardians, they also had Mythical Companion Beasts. If a single Mythical Companion Beast were to challenge them, there was almost no chance of winning.</p>
<p>But what if it was a human with a large number of Mythical Companion Beasts?</p>
<p>Invisibility Cloak, Golden Battle God Halberd, five Demon Blood True Dragons, Medusa, and Ancient Splitting Tadpole. There were already nine Mythical Companion Beasts in battle, and there might even be more.</p>
<p>If such a human participated in the battle and he didn’t contract a Guardian, could he defeat a human with a Guardian?</p>
<p>This article immediately sparked global attention, turning the originally tense ranking battle into a discussion.</p>
<p>“In theory, with the Invisibility Cloak, one can guarantee their safety. There are also a large number of Mythical Companion Beasts. If one swarms a Guardian with a sea of pets, the Guardian will also be defeated.”</p>
<p>“Such a strategy is useless. Guardians have absolute strength to suppress them. Furthermore, the owner of the Guardian also has Mythical Companion Beasts.”</p>
<p>“I think there’s a chance of defeating a Guardian. The premise is that these Companion Beasts belong to the same person.”</p>
<p>“This problem isn’t valid at all. Without a Guardian, humans won’t be able to reach the Mythical stage. There’s no possibility of them entering the ranking battle.”</p>
<p>At the end of the discussion, everyone realized that it was indeed meaningless. Without a Guardian, it was impossible for humans to participate in the battle. Even if the Companion Beasts belonged to the same person, it was useless.</p>
<p>This made everyone realize that the ranking battle was actually still dominated by the dimension. Humans were just auxiliary to the battle, not the protagonists.</p>
<p>I really want to see real humans participate in the battle and not the companions of those Guardians! Many people had this thought.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, humans were unable to advance to the Mythical stage. This was an indisputable fact. It was impossible to see pure humans participate in the battle.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t think too much about it. With nothing to do, he was grinding dungeons. When he was almost done grinding the other dungeons, Zhou Wen went to the Maze of Lies on Sunday, hoping to see if he could kill the twin witches.</p>
<p>To his surprise, after entering the Maze of Lies, he discovered that the Devil Clown had respawned. After killing the Devil Clown, he heard a ding and a Companion Egg dropped.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He had been grinding for a long time without any Mythical Companion Eggs dropping. Today, a Demon Blood True Dragon and a Devil Clown had dropped one after another.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1047'>Chapter 1047: The Method to Killing the Destiny Twin Witches</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Devil Clown: Mythical</p>
<p>Life Providence: Devil’s Spokesperson</p>
<p>Life Soul: Devil Believer</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Clown</p>
<p>Strength: 67</p>
<p>Speed: 80</p>
<p>Constitution: 62</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 78</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Stealth Travel, Reverse Magic Ball, Poison Blade</p>
<p>Companion Form: Soul</p>
<p>Devil Clown’s stats were somewhat extreme, but he was actually a very rare soul-type Companion Beast. By having the Devil Clown possess him in his soul form, he could use his various abilities. This was rather useful to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>I wonder if I can kill the twin Destiny Witches. It will be interesting if I can have the two witches’ Companion Eggs drop. Zhou Wen had nothing to do, so he wanted to give it a shot.</p>
<p>It was definitely impossible to kill the Destiny Witches with ordinary methods. They seemed to have some special powers. Killing them was equivalent to killing the blood-colored avatar. If any of them died, the blood-colored avatar would die with them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already attempted it before. Truth Listener’s Evil Nullification and the Heaven-Opening Scripture were useless. They were unable to withstand the kind of death power.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen wanted Demonic Neonate to give it a go. Demonic Neonate was a powerful existence at the Terror grade. If she killed the Destiny Witch, would there be any problems?</p>
<p>When he arrived at the Destiny Witch Castle, Zhou Wen summoned Demonic Neonate and ordered her to kill the Destiny Witch.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate used the Demonic Sword to kill the white-robed witch, but at the same time, the blood-colored avatar died with her.</p>
<p>Is this method useless? Zhou Wen frowned slightly.</p>
<p>However, he felt that there had to be a way to kill the Destiny Witches. It was impossible for there to be a dimensional creature that was absolutely invincible.</p>
<p>No matter how strong the Destiny Witches were, they were only at the Mythical stage. They hadn’t reached the Terror grade, so it was unlikely that they were that strong. However, because their abilities were so strange, a special method might be needed to kill them.</p>
<p>What kind of power can kill them? Zhou Wen thought to himself, hoping to find their weakness.</p>
<p>It’s probably unrealistic to kill them directly unless I have the ability to revive. Unfortunately, even Li Xuan doesn’t have the ability to revive, much less me. The Destiny Witches don’t seem to have any offensive strength. As long as one doesn’t draw their cards, they won’t be able to do anything to the opponent. It’s only because they control the door that leads to the garden that I have no choice but to draw their cards… Wait… Draw their cards…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen seemed to think of something as his eyes lit up. He continued thinking to himself, Their cards can kill, and they can open the door to the garden. Then, are there cards in the deck that can kill them?</p>
<p>In the past, Zhou Wen had always stopped after drawing the door-opening card. Now, he wanted to give it a try. If he continued drawing, would he encounter any special cards that might have a backlash effect on the twin Destiny Witches?</p>
<p>He arrived in front of the white-robed witch again. Under the double protection of Truth Listener and the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, Zhou Wen began drawing his cards again.</p>
<p>Every card had a different diagram that represented different ways of death. However, to Zhou Wen, these ways of death were useless. After all, they were ineffective against him.</p>
<p>After drawing the twenty-third card, Zhou Wen finally drew the mask card again. The door to the garden opened.</p>
<p>However, this time, Zhou Wen didn’t choose to walk through the door. Instead, he continued drawing the cards in the white-robed witch’s hand, hoping to see if the remaining cards hid the secret to killing her.</p>
<p>He looked at the cards one by one, but the outcome was the same. Apart from the mask card, the other cards only had the ability to kill the opponent.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t discover any negative effects on the white-robed witch as he drew.</p>
<p>Could it be that I was wrong? These Destiny Cards don’t hide the secret to killing the Destiny Witches? Zhou Wen drew the last card. After flipping it over, he immediately felt the Truth Listener earring transform a large amount of Essence Energy before sending it into the blood-colored avatar’s body. Clearly, the target of this card was him and not the white-robed Destiny Witch.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at the white-robed Destiny Witch. She no longer had any cards in her hand as she stood there motionless. She had no intention of attacking or retreating.</p>
<p>Can a witch without cards be killed? Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he decided to give it another try.</p>
<p>He summoned the Light Concealment Sword and killed the white-robed witch with one strike. The blood-colored avatar died as well.</p>
<p>This still doesn’t work? Zhou Wen thought to himself, but he felt that his train of thought wasn’t wrong.</p>
<p>Since he couldn’t kill the Destiny Witch directly, he had to think of a solution based on her cards.</p>
<p>Could it be that I have to finish drawing all the cards in the twin witches’ hands? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that he had to give it a shot.</p>
<p>He entered the game again, but this time, Zhou Wen didn’t even look at the cards. He drew all the cards in the twin witches’ hands, leaving none behind.</p>
<p>However, the outcome was still the same. Among the 108 cards, there were two mask cards. The other cards were cards that could kill him, and not one of them caused a backlash to the witch.</p>
<p>Looking at the cardless twin witches, Zhou Wen wanted to try killing them again to see if he would suffer a backlash.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to attack, Zhou Wen’s heart suddenly stirred. He didn’t slash down with the sword in his hand as he glanced at the Destiny Cards he had drawn.</p>
<p>He held the two decks of cards in his hand, shuffled them up, and placed them in front of the two witches. “Do you want to draw cards?”</p>
<p>The expression of the twin Destiny Witches, who had been expressionless all this while, finally turned solemn. They stared at the cards in Zhou Wen’s hand and really extended their hands to draw.</p>
<p>The white-robed witch drew a black card, the card of the guillotine. Then, a shadow of the guillotine appeared over the white-robed witch. In the next second, the white-robed witch was beheaded.</p>
<p>‘Killed Mythical creature, Destiny Twin Witch (White).’</p>
<p>They can really be killed like that! From the looks of it, they have to abide by the rules of the Destiny Cards. Zhou Wen looked at the black-robed witch as she drew a white card. On it was the gallows.</p>
<p>Then, the black-robed witch was hanged. The game gave another notification: ‘Killed Destiny Twin Witch (Black).’</p>
<p>Although the two witches didn’t drop anything, it delighted Zhou Wen. He had finally found a way to kill the Destiny Twin Witches. It was only a matter of time before a Companion Egg dropped.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Destiny Twin Witches were Mythical creatures that needed two days to respawn. Otherwise, Zhou Wen would have farmed them dozens of times and have the Destiny Twin Witches drop to see what their stats and skills were.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ancient Splitting Tadpole’s time was up. Zhou Wen needed to choose a new Companion Beast to stall for time.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1048'>Chapter 1048: Time’s Up</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Which Companion Beast should I send out? Zhou Wen mainly didn’t want others to know that these Companion Beasts belonged to him, so he didn’t want to use his signature Companion Beast to fight. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have needed to consider so much.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen decided to get the newly hatched Devil Clown to fight. Then, he did the math. Invisibility Cloak, Golden Battle God Halberd, five Demon Blood True Dragons, Medusa, Ancient Splitting Tadpole, and Devil Clown. I’ll need at most three more Mythical Companion Beasts to drag it out for twenty-four hours. After twenty-four hours, I can get the Companion Beasts I previously fought to challenge again. It shouldn’t be difficult to last for forty-eight hours.</p>
<p>Although he had this plan in mind, Zhou Wen didn’t believe that dimensional creatures would really let him stall for time. Perhaps there would be a new technique that would prevent him from stalling.</p>
<p>I can only take it one step at a time. I wonder what Zhong Ziya is doing. Why must I help him stall for 48 hours? Zhou Wen had considered this problem before, but he couldn’t figure out the reason.</p>
<p>When the Devil Clown appeared in the arena, it caused another heated discussion.</p>
<p>“Another new Mythical Companion Beast I’ve never seen before. Amazing. How many Mythical Companion Beasts does he have?”</p>
<p>“Devil Clown, where does this Companion Beast come from? I’ve never heard of it before.”</p>
<p>“Now, we can confirm that this is a family clan’s operation, right? It’s impossible for one person to have so many Mythical Companion Beasts.”</p>
<p>Soon, the media in the North District revealed the origins of the Devil Clown. They explained in detail how terrifying the Maze of Lies was and how terrifying the dimensional zone on Sunday was.</p>
<p>“It’s actually a Mythical Companion Beast from the North District. Now, all the Mythical Companion Beasts in the North, South, East, and West District are here. How do we guess? Which district’s family are they from?”</p>
<p>Now, most people believed that it couldn’t be a person. It had to be a family.</p>
<p>The six families and some wealthy families were also investigating who these Companion Beasts belonged to. With so many Mythical Companion Beasts, even in this rapidly developing era with more and more Mythical Companion Beasts appearing, the impact was still terrifying.</p>
<p>However, after repeated investigations, no family clan met the requirements.</p>
<p>“What Companion Beast will appear next? I’m really looking forward to it.”</p>
<p>“If so many Mythical Companion Beasts belong to the same person, how strong is this person?”</p>
<p>“Impossible. Even among the six families, no one has so many Mythical Companion Beasts.”</p>
<p>“That’s true. It’s too difficult.”</p>
<p>Everyone was looking forward to the appearance of a new Companion Beast. They wanted to know how many Mythical Companion Beasts this mysterious unknown family clan could produce.</p>
<p>Another two hours passed. When the Night Immaculate Sword appeared, the Xia family quickly recognized it.</p>
<p>This was because someone from the Xia family had once fought the Night Immaculate Sword, but no Companion Beast dropped. Now that they saw Night Immaculate Sword appear in the arena, the Xia family was puzzled. Who was it that managed to get the Night Immaculate Sword drop? It only appeared in the Ancient Sword Tomb that the Xia family controlled. This was too strange.</p>
<p>After the origins of the Night Immaculate Sword were revealed, many people suspected that the family with these Companion Beasts was the Xia family.</p>
<p>If one wasn’t from the Xia family, one was forbidden from entering the Ancient Sword Tomb. Therefore, the owner of Night Immaculate Sword was very likely from the Xia family.</p>
<p>As people were making all sorts of guesses, another two hours later, a Companion Beast named Dragon Tiger Pill Essence appeared in the cube’s arena.</p>
<p>The Zhang family couldn’t sit still upon seeing this. The most precious pill essence in Pill Furnace Mountain wasn’t the Mythical Life Regeneration Pill or the Resurrection Pill, but the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence that Zhou Wen had managed to obtain.</p>
<p>Although all of them were at the Mythical stage, the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence had the characteristics of the Rejuvenation Pill and the Resurrection Pill. It was a divine pill that could virtually revive the dead.</p>
<p>Of course, the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence wasn’t really able to revive the dead. However, to a certain extent, it could heal injuries that resuscitation couldn’t.</p>
<p>However, as the chances of the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence appearing were too low, the Zhang family had only encountered it a few times. None of them had dropped Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>However, Pill Furnace Mountain was a restricted area of the Zhang family. Outsiders were unable to enter. Now, someone had used the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence that the Zhang family didn’t have. How could the Zhang family not be alarmed?</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>The people who originally suspected the Xia family began to suspect the Zhang family. After all, the Zhang family’s pill essence was just too famous.</p>
<p>The Zhang family was also doing its best to investigate. They wanted to know when the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence had dropped, but there was no result.</p>
<p>All sorts of guesses flew around the Federation. Now, everyone wanted to know who the family that had these Companion Beasts was. However, no matter how many guesses they made, they couldn’t confirm it.</p>
<p>The entity had Mythical Companion Beasts from all four districts. It was very difficult to guess.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Young Master Zhou Wen’s luck with Companion Beasts is too good. I really wonder how he managed to have so many Mythical Companion Beasts drop.” An Sheng couldn’t help but marvel when he saw the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence.</p>
<p>“It’s just luck,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>An Sheng said with a bitter expression, “Overseer, why don’t we get Young Master Wen to join us the next time we hunt a Mythical creature?”</p>
<p>“Why will you be inviting him? Can’t we kill it ourselves?” An Tianzuo snorted coldly.</p>
<p>“We can kill them, but in the past two months, we’ve killed more than ten Mythical creatures. Quite a number of dimensional crystals dropped, but none of the Companion Beasts dropped…” An Sheng said helplessly.</p>
<p>The corners of An Tianzuo’s eyes twitched. His luck hadn’t been good recently. He had killed quite a number of Mythical creatures, but he just couldn’t get a Companion Egg to drop.</p>
<p>“It has nothing to do with the person. Just kill more,” An Tianzuo said expressionlessly.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Yes, Overseer. Then let’s kill more,” An Sheng said solemnly.</p>
<p>“How’s Little Jing now?” An Tianzuo asked after some thought.</p>
<p>“Miss Jing has been cultivating at Chess Mountain’s encampment. Now, Miss Jing is much more composed. She has made quite a number of contributions and is very respected,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“That’s good.” An Tianzuo nodded slightly.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Now, the entire Federation and even the overseas factions were discussing what new Mythical Companion Beasts would be joining the battle.</p>
<p>When the Evil Spirit King appeared, no one knew what Companion Beast it was. They had never even heard of it before, so they couldn’t obtain any information through investigations.</p>
<p>Another two hours passed. Under the attention of everyone, a new Companion Beast appeared, but on careful look, there was nothing. On careful look, they realized that the Companion Beast that issued the challenge was the Invisibility Cloak.</p>
<p>Only then did people realize that twenty-four hours had passed. The Invisibility Cloak that had previously issued a challenge could now be used again.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1049'>Chapter 1049: Altering the Rules Again</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Twenty-four hours have passed, and the Invisibility Cloak has appeared again. Doesn’t that mean that by using these Companion Beasts, one can indefinitely repeat the trick day by day until the last day of the rankings ends and enters the unlimited single challenge mode? Only then can one chase the Golden Battle God Halberd down from first place?”</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, that works? Then we won’t be able to see anything new. There are still a few days until the end of the rankings.”</p>
<p>“Let me do the math. A total of thirteen Mythical Companion Beasts appeared. This is terrifying enough. Typical Guardians probably won’t have a chance of winning if they encounter him, right?”</p>
<p>“That might not be the case. Some powerful Guardians have AOE attacks that can insta kill them. It’s useless no matter how many low-level Mythical Companion Beasts there are.”</p>
<p>“Haha, I originally imagined that it would be a battle between Guardians. I never expected to not see Guardians in the next few days.”</p>
<p>“What a pity. Pure humans can’t participate. Otherwise, I would really want to see what kind of scene when these Companion Beasts appear alongside one person.”</p>
<p>As everyone was discussing, they suddenly realized that the dazzling light had appeared above the cube arena again.</p>
<p>This time, the beam-like creature was even more straightforward. After it appeared, it said, “The time to accept a challenge for Companion Beasts shall be shortened to three minutes. If the challenge is not accepted in three minutes, it will be considered a forfeit.”</p>
<p>With that said, the dazzling creature tore through the air and vanished.</p>
<p>“Why are they only targeting Companion Beasts? Why aren’t Guardians suffering any restrictions?”</p>
<p>“This is clearly discrimination against humans. It’s fine if you don’t let pure humans participate in the competition, but even Companion Beasts are being targeted by changing the rules again and again. Then why don’t you just not let Companion Beasts participate in the competition? Why are you acting so hypocritical? Disgusting.”</p>
<p>“What can we do? The rules are set by dimensional creatures. This is their game to begin with. They can change it however they want. Humans are nothing.”</p>
<p>“How infuriating. They play however they like because they have the means to do so. When they are at a disadvantage, they change the rules. How f*cking shameless.”</p>
<p>“Don’t play if you can’t afford it. Just say that only Guardians can participate.”</p>
<p>People were gloating the last time the rules were changed, but this time, many people were crying out for justice for the Companion Beasts’ owner.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that they had any feelings for these Companion Beasts, nor did they really like to fight for justice. It was just that the dimension’s repeated changing of the rules allowed them to see through the essence of the ranking battle.</p>
<p>This wasn’t a game for humans at all. Even human Companion Beasts were targeted time and time again. This feeling was very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“The acceptance time for a challenge has been changed to three minutes. In that case, it will take twice the number of Companion Beasts a day to hold the top of the rankings. Even if it’s any one of the six families, it won’t be easy to gather twenty-four Mythical Companion Beasts,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“Is there no other way?” Zhang Yuzhi said as she looked at the Golden Battle God Halberd on the screen.</p>
<p>“There’s no other way unless more Mythical Companion Beasts participate in the battle. However, even if we gather twenty-four Mythical Companion Beasts, the dimensional creatures can still change the rules again,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“In that case, what’s the point of setting the rules?” Zhang Yuzhi said.</p>
<p>“It’s meaningless to begin with. To the dimension, this is just a game. However, to Earth, this game might decide our fate for the next year,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“Is it that serious? Will the person really become the King of Earth if they win first place? I don’t think so.” Zhang Yuzhi didn’t agree with Zhang Chunqiu’s point of view.</p>
<p>“It’s very serious. It’s so serious that it’s unimaginable,” Zhang Chunqiu said seriously.</p>
<p>“Since it’s so serious, why don’t we stop it?” Zhang Yuzhi asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“We’re trying, but there’s not much time left.” Zhang Chunqiu smiled. “However, the situation isn’t that bad. After all, Guardians who participate in the battle have to rely on humans to go further. Perhaps those humans can influence Guardians.”</p>
<p>“The Guardian grows, but human’s strength is stagnant. Its influence will only weaken with time. How much use can it be?” Zhang Yuzhi clearly knew what the Guardian was about.</p>
<p>“That might not be the case. There’s still a way,” Zhang Chunqiu said with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>“You mean Ya, Wang Mingyuan, and company…” Zhang Yuzhi was alarmed.</p>
<p>“What they can do might not be impossible for us considering our Zhang family’s abilities,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“But that would make…” Zhang Yuzhi didn’t finish her sentence.</p>
<p>“Make us a monster?” Zhang Chunqiu leaned on the railing and looked at the distant Mount Dragon Tiger. “Sometimes, it’s really difficult to distinguish between humans and monsters. If I have to choose between monsters and being enslaved, I’d rather become a monster.”</p>
<p>With that said, Zhang Chunqiu turned his head and smiled brightly at Zhang Yuzhi. “Of course, it’s the kind of monster that doesn’t eat humans.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>At the Dugu family residence in the South District, Dugu Ge was also watching the livestream. His face was expressionless, and it was unknown what he was thinking.</p>
<p>“Second Uncle, is it really impossible for humans to advance to the Mythical stage through their own strength?” Dugu Ge was still in a daze, but he asked Worm Dugu.</p>
<p>“No one can do it for the time being,” Worm Dugu answered.</p>
<p>Dugu Ge seemed to have long known that this was the answer. He continued muttering to himself, “Our Dugu family has been researching for many years, but we haven’t found a way to advance humans to the Mythical stage. Could it be that we have to take Wang Mingyuan’s old path?”</p>
<p>“You can’t say that. In fact, it’s not like our family hasn’t made any progress over the years. For example, the art of humans and Gu becoming one might allow humans to advance to the Mythical stage,” said Worm Dugu.</p>
<p>Dugu Ge shook his head and said, “We are just fooling ourselves. What’s the difference between the so-called humans and Gu as one? It’s just that he uses a Guardian, while we use Gu. We all turn into monsters. There’s no difference.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing we can do about that. Humans have huge flaws in their talent. There’s an uncrossable gap between them and the Mythical stage.” Worm Dugu was somewhat helpless.</p>
<p>When he was young, he was like Dugu Ge and company. He had a passion and wanted to rely on his own strength to advance to the Mythical stage, but after so many years, the Gu he had reared had advanced to the Mythical stage. However, he ultimately remained at the peak of the Epic stage and couldn’t advance any further.</p>
<p>“Forget it. Let’s see how the owner of those Companion Beasts deals with the situations. To take out twenty-four Mythical Companion Beasts at once, even the six families can’t easily gather them, right? Even if they can, no one will expose their strength in public.” Dugu Ge looked at the Golden Battle God Halberd with interest.</p>

<p>Zhou Wen was also somewhat worried. Although he had quite a number of Mythical Companion Beasts, it was somewhat difficult to gather twenty-four. Furthermore, he definitely needed to send his signature Companion Beasts in that situation.</p>
<p>What should I do? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>With the principle of stalling for time, Zhou Wen first got the Companion Beasts that could fight to stall for time before slowly thinking of a solution.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“According to the principle of being able to issue another challenge after twenty-four hours, he still has one Companion Beast after the Invisibility Cloak. The Companion Beasts after that won’t reach the twenty-four hour requirement. Therefore, new Companion Beasts need to be sent to battle. Otherwise, he can only give up on occupying first place on the rankings,” An Sheng said as he did the math.</p>
<p>“It’s a meaningless move to begin with. So what if he can continue dominating the rankings? The final unlimited challenge has already been decided. It’s impossible to obtain first place with this method,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Everyone was discussing what the Golden Battle God Halberd’s owner would do next. Would he release a new Companion Beast or end the domination of the rankings?</p>
<p>Most people felt that it was meaningless to let Companion Beasts continue occupying first place. The dimension wouldn’t give ordinary Companion Beasts the chance to win by trickery.</p>
<p>This period of time was a torture for everyone. Everyone wanted to know what the owner of the Golden Battle God Halberd would do after the rules changed.</p>
<p>The various media outlets also wrote all sorts of analysis articles. Most of the media felt that there was no need to continue after the rules were changed. Even if the owner of the Golden Battle God Halberd had other Mythical Companion Beasts, it was meaningless to continue if they couldn’t maintain the full 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>And to achieve a 24-hour cycle, it required at least 24 Mythical Companion Beasts. At present, only the six hero families had such strength.</p>
<p>However, up to now, no family clan had stepped forward to admit that the Golden Battle God Halberd’s dominance of the rankings was their doing.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Time quickly passed as everyone waited in anticipation.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also racking his brains to think of a solution. Zhong Ziya had made it sound so serious. He had to think of a way to survive the remaining twenty plus hours.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon, Behemoth, Tai Sui, Great Might Vajra Bull, Galaxy Shell Dragon, and other Companion Beasts I have are too iconic. As long as I use them, everyone will definitely guess that it’s me. Furthermore, exposing all my important combat strength will be very disadvantageous for me. However, other than that, what other way can I stall for time? After some thought, Zhou Wen’s eyes suddenly lit up as he summoned Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate looked at Zhou Wen quietly. It wasn’t that she lacked intelligence, but she didn’t like to speak. Even when facing Zhou Wen, she remained silent.</p>
<p>“Neonate, how’re your food reserves?” Zhou Wen was naturally referring to Grim Demon.</p>
<p>After Grim Demon devoured the corpse the last time, it seemed to have evolved. However, as there was no information on Grim Demon in-game, he didn’t know if he had completed his evolution.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate didn’t say a word. All she did was summon the Demonic Sword and pull it out of its scabbard. With a casual shake, Grim Demon flew out of the sword.</p>
<p>“Grim Demon, long time no see. Come, sit down and have a drink. Let’s have a good chat,” Zhou Wen said with a smile as he waved at Grim Demon.</p>
<p>Grim Demon was extremely shrewd. From Zhou Wen’s expression, he knew that Zhou Wen needed his help. He immediately put on the airs of a boss and raised his chin slightly as he looked at Zhou Wen in contempt. “What’s the matter? Tell me and let me consider it…”</p>
<p>As he spoke, he suddenly broke out into a cold sweat. He hurriedly turned his head and saw Demonic Neonate looking at him. Her arrogant look immediately turned into a fawning one. He lowered his head and bent his waist as he said to Zhou Wen with a smile, “Feel free to tell me if you need anything. I’ll definitely help you settle it.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded and sized up Grim Demon before asking, “How’s your current strength? Do you have the strength of a Terror-grade?”</p>
<p>When Grim Demon heard Zhou Wen’s question, he immediately felt smug. “What kind of existence am I, Grim Demon? Of course, I have the strength of a Terror-grade. Ignoring the Terror-grade, if I hadn’t been suppressed for so long, even a Calamity-grade creature wouldn’t be a problem…”</p>
<p>“Not bad.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>“Not… bad…” When Grim Demon heard that and looked at Zhou Wen’s expression, he had the urge to immediately use his Terror Transformation powers to rip him to shreds, letting him know that the dignity of a Terror-grade expert couldn’t be violated.</p>
<p>However, when he saw Demonic Neonate, Grim Demon’s words changed. “You’re right. My standard is indeed only not bad… It’s alright…”</p>
<p>“Then that’s it. You can head on up for the challenge later,” Zhou Wen said as he pointed at the cube beside him.</p>
<p>Grim Demon’s eyes lit up when he saw the cube. He immediately became ambitious as he said loudly, “Don’t worry. Now that I’ve recovered a lot of my strength, defeating those brats and getting first place won’t be difficult. It’s time to let those new brats know how powerful their Grim Demon ancestor is.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded and said, “That’s good. After you go up, try your best to stall for time. Only defeat is allowed.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll definitely kill everyone. Only defeat is … What…” After Grim Demon figured out his condition, he widened his eyes and looked at Zhou Wen. It was almost as though something had gone wrong with his ears.</p>
<p>“The Companion Beasts on it are mine. Is there a problem?” Zhou Wen asked Grim Demon.</p>
<p>“Can I… not go…” Grim Demon suppressed the urge to smash Zhou Wen into smithereens and asked humbly.</p>
<p>He was Grim Demon, yet he had to be defeated by such a weak Companion Beast. Grim Demon felt that it was a huge insult to him.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” As Zhou Wen spoke, he glanced at Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>Grim Demon subconsciously glanced at Demonic Neonate with Zhou Wen before immediately making up his mind. He swore to Zhou Wen, “It’s my honor to work for you. I’ll definitely do my best and lose flawlessly.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need for you to be flawless, nor do you need to fight. Just go up and stall for time. Stall for as long as you can. When I get Demonic Neonate to inform you, just admit defeat yourself.” Zhou Wen recounted his request in detail.</p>
<p>The changes in the rules of the dimensional creatures were targeted at Companion Beasts, but Guardians weren’t included.</p>
<p>If Grim Demon took the challenge, he wouldn’t have to abide by the rules of having a victor within an hour.</p>
<p>I want to see how those dimension assholes will change the rules. Are they going to restrict Guardians as well? Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>This was clearly impossible. If elimination of both sides happened when Guardians couldn’t decide a victor in an hour, things would probably happen in the final battle.</p>
<p>Soon, the one-hour countdown arrived. Everyone looked at the cube’s big screen and waited for the Golden Battle God Halberd’s owner to make a decision.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1051'>Chapter 1051: Grim Demon’s Appearance</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Unexpectedly, the Invisibility Cloak didn’t admit defeat this time. Instead, the Golden Battle God Halberd admitted defeat and left the battlefield.</p>
<p>People believed that this was a sign of giving up. Presumably, the owner of the Golden Battle God Halberd didn’t wish to continue.</p>
<p>“Is it finally ending? Although I knew that it was meaningless, I don’t know why, but I still have some indescribable anticipation,” someone said in disappointment.</p>
<p>“Perhaps it’s because of our own expectations. In the real world, we have many things we want to do, but due to our own conditions or various reasons, we can’t do it. Sometimes, we will subconsciously hope that someone can do something that we can’t. Even if it’s just watching others succeed, we will be very happy,” his friend said after some thought.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Although we can’t participate in the ranking battle, we still hope that there are real humans who can participate and not those fellows with Guardians.”</p>
<p>Another person said, “There’s actually no difference, right? Aren’t Companion Beasts and Guardians the same external forces?”</p>
<p>“How can it be the same? Companion Beasts are obtained through our own hard work. That’s the power we control. But what about Guardians? Their power ultimately belongs to them. They represent the dimension. Even if they win in the end, it only means that the dimensional race they represent obtained victory, not us humans.”</p>
<p>There were many people who shared the same thoughts as them, but everyone knew that the era of Guardians was coming. This was already an irreversible trend.</p>
<p>The Invisibility Cloak took first place, and a Guardian immediately issued a challenge.</p>
<p>The Invisibility Cloak was a Companion Beast. According to the changed rules, it only had three minutes to accept the challenge.</p>
<p>Three minutes quickly passed. The humans stared at the screen, wondering if the Invisibility Cloak would still choose a Companion Beast as its opponent.</p>
<p>A light flashed on the screen as the Invisibility Cloak accepted the challenge. However, this time, the one challenging the Invisibility Cloak wasn’t a Companion Beast, but a Guardian.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, he has really given up. Everyone sighed inwardly. Although they knew that failure was inevitable, they were unwilling to see this moment arrive.</p>
<p>“Grim Demon is a Guardian I’ve never heard of. I wonder who he belongs to.”</p>
<p>“It looks like only the Guardian went on stage. His human companion didn’t appear alongside him.”</p>
<p>“Does he look down on the Invisibility Cloak that much?”</p>
<p>“That’s true. Although Guardians are also at the Mythical stage, they are clearly much stronger than ordinary Mythical Companion Beasts. Furthermore, the Invisibility Cloak isn’t a Companion Beast with very strong combat strength. I believe this Guardian will still win in the end.”</p>
<p>Everyone suddenly felt dispirited. The Guardian battle that they had been looking forward to was no longer that interesting.</p>
<p>“We’re finally back on track. Let me see how strong the other Guardians are.” A man in Guardian armor smiled when he saw Grim Demon appear.</p>
<p>However, after a while, people suddenly realized something amiss.</p>
<p>After Grim Demon entered the cube’s arena, he floated in the air. He looked very mysterious, mighty, and domineering. However, he only floated there and looked up at the sky at a 45-degree angle without attacking.</p>
<p>“Wait, what’s going on? Look at that Guardian. Doesn’t the way he’s acting look familiar?”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me he’s here to stall for time like those Companion Beasts?”</p>
<p>“No… Impossible…”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s possible either. What’s the point of a Guardian stalling for time? Besides, if there’s a Guardian, why don’t you appear with the Guardian? Why do you need those Companion Beasts?”</p>
<p>“But look, he’s really the same as the Companion Beasts from before. He’s just standing there without moving.”</p>
<p>Instantly, ripples surged once again in the Federation. Everyone was guessing what Grim Demon, the Guardian, was up to. Why was he doing this?</p>
<p>Also, was the owner of Grim Demon and the owner of the Invisibility Cloak the same person, or was he just stalling for time?</p>
<p>“It’s been half an hour, but Grim Demon still hasn’t moved. From the looks of it, there’s no mistake. He’s also stalling for time.”</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, since he possesses a Guardian, why didn’t he use it earlier? Turns out that this is a fellow who started out with the help of a Guardian.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. If he didn’t have a Guardian, how could he have killed so many Mythical creatures and have so many Companion Beasts drop?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you find it strange? Why didn’t his human companion participate? Instead, the Guardian went up by himself?”</p>
<p>As people discussed, the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau suddenly released an article, “The Contract between Humans and Guardians.”</p>
<p>An interesting idea was proposed in the article. This idea also caused a huge reaction in the Federation.</p>
<p>The article pointed out that up to now, more than forty humans had known to contract Guardians. Some of them didn’t hide their identities and had even become celebrities among humans.</p>
<p>Some were originally unknown youths who ended up becoming famous celebrities in the Federation.</p>
<p>The Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau had also interviewed a portion of them. All humans with Guardians said that their contract with Guardians was absolutely fair. Any party could terminate the contract at any time without any ramifications.</p>
<p>However, the reporter from the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau pointed out that although this contract looked absolutely fair, it wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>After humans contracted with Guardians, the growth of humans would stop. As for Guardians, they could continue to become stronger. It looked like a fair contract, but in the end, only the Guardians benefited.</p>
<p>Of course, when humans had the Guardian, they could also use Guardians to do things that were beneficial to them. However, in the end, humans were more like tools.</p>
<p>Grim Demon’s lone appearance in the arena gave the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau’s reporter a sudden thought. Hence, he raised the question of whether there was only one way for a human to contract a Guardian.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he also speculated the possibility of another contract that placed the human in the driver’s seat. Before humans violated the contract, the Guardian couldn’t take the initiative to terminate the contract.</p>
<p>“How is that possible? The difference in strength between humans and Guardians is too great. Even if there’s such a contractual method, Guardians will definitely not be willing to sign something like that.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Now, humans are in need of Guardians. How can they sign such a contract?”</p>
<p>“It sounds like this contract method is even fairer. The Guardian obtains benefits from humans, so it doesn’t make sense that they can leave whenever they want to.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Even a divorce requires one to split the family assets. Letting all the benefits be taken away by the Guardian is unfair in itself.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1052'>Chapter 1052: Have to Fight</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>As people discussed, Grim Demon felt extremely uncomfortable standing in the arena.</p>
<p>This was supposed to be a stage where he slaughtered everyone and made everyone tremble in fear. He wanted people to know that he was back, but now, he could only stand there and do nothing.</p>
<p>Although he had already tried his best to appear cool and powerful, Grim Demon was extremely displeased when he thought about how he would have to admit defeat in the future.</p>
<p>That detestable human. If it wasn’t for Her Lady Demonic Neonate, I would have blasted him to pieces, Grim Demon thought gloomily.</p>
<p>Since he was only here to stall for time, Grim Demon closed his eyes and waited for time to pass.</p>
<p>After an hour, Grim Demon suddenly felt that something was amiss. Opening his eyes, he realized that the Invisibility Cloak had been forcefully ejected from the cube’s arena, and he had won.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Grim Demon was pleasantly surprised as he thought to himself, It’s not my fault. That thing admitted defeat.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t the only one stunned by this sudden development. All the humans on Earth were stunned.</p>
<p>Soon, people realized what had happened.</p>
<p>“Isn’t this too much of a bully? How can a Companion Beast be judged to lose within an hour while a Guardian is judged to have won?”</p>
<p>“It’s unfair!”</p>
<p>“I’ve seen shameless people, but I’ve never seen such a shameless person. If you want to deem it as the loser, both of them should be deemed as having lost. What right does a Guardian have to stand there without moving to be judged the winner?”</p>
<p>People were furious as they made condemnations about it, but it was useless.</p>
<p>The ranking battle continued. Everything was still under the control of the dimension.</p>
<p>People couldn’t help but feel sad. This was clearly the selection of the King of Earth, but Earth’s creatures didn’t even have the right to choose.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Wang Lu were also stunned by this shameless act. Wang Lu said angrily, “These fellows are bullying us.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen snapped to his senses and said thankfully, “I’m already considered very lucky. Thankfully, they didn’t deem Grim Demon to have lost. Otherwise, the situation would only be worse.”</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had already thought about it. It was unlikely that both parties would be eliminated. That way, there would be no first place.</p>
<p>If the second place was replaced, it would still be Zhong Ziya. First place would still fall into the hands of outsiders.</p>
<p>However, this way, Zhou Wen’s plan of using Grim Demon to stall for the full 48 hours failed. All he could do was let Grim Demon continue accepting challenges.</p>
<p>“You want to fight? Then let’s fight.” Zhou Wen was still confident in Grim Demon’s strength.</p>
<p>Regardless, this fellow already had the strength of a Terror-grade. It shouldn’t be a problem for him to defeat ordinary Guardians.</p>
<p>As long as the challenger wasn’t a Guardian at Night Thearch’s level, Grim Demon’s victory was almost certain.</p>
<p>There were quite a number of Guardians challenging Grim Demon. Zhou Wen had previously learned about some of them. After seeing some of their battles and looking at the challenge list, he got Demonic Neonate to inform Grim Demon and accept one of the Guardians’ challenges.</p>
<p>“You have to win.” Zhou Wen finally got Demonic Neonate to inform Grim Demon.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate only needed to inform Grim Demon with her mind. Grim Demon was overjoyed when he heard that, but he still muttered, “Why is there a need to select opponents? My strength is enough to suppress everything. No matter how many of those brats come, they will all die.”</p>
<p>However, despite saying that, Grim Demon still accepted a challenge from a Guardian named Darkness Emissary according to the instructions Demonic Neonate had sent.</p>
<p>Darkness Emissary had previously been interviewed by the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau. It was a rather encouraging story.</p>
<p>A youth from a small city had entered a famous school with excellent results. After graduation, he took things one step at a time and became an excellent freelance hunter. Then, he obtained the favor of the heavens and unexpectedly encountered a Guardian cocoon. It also happened to match his hidden talent, allowing him to leap to the top of the Federation.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>At that moment, Wei Ge held a teacup in one hand as he watched the livestream while flipping through the information beside him. The information was regarding Darkness Emissary.</p>
<p>After Wei Ge had graduated, he went through many twists and turns before finally entering the Special Investigation Bureau. He had started off as an ordinary inspector, but now, he was only a low-ranking archive administrator.</p>
<p>Although this was only the bureau’s ordinary archive room, the information Wei Ge could come into contact with was incomparable to the past.</p>
<p>He wasn’t in a rush. He insisted on combing through the files every day. Others weren’t willing to do such a boring job, but he enjoyed it. Now, Wei Ge knew the entire archives like the back of his hand.</p>
<p>The information regarding Darkness Emissary and Zhou Ming was also included. After he saw Darkness Emissary enter the arena, he pulled out his docket to take a look.</p>
<p>They both have the same surname, but why is there such a huge difference between them? Wei Ge couldn’t help but sigh after seeing Darkness Emissary’s information.</p>
<p>The information obtained by the bureau naturally wasn’t as simple as it looked. From the information, not only was Zhou Ming ruthless, but he also didn’t care about friendship.</p>
<p>His family background was indeed not good. He had a girlfriend in high school, and her family didn’t despise him. They even paid him to attend a famous school. In the end, after he made a comeback, he abandoned that girlfriend and found another beautiful one.</p>
<p>Wei Ge looked at his first girlfriend’s photo. She was indeed not beautiful. She could only be considered average and was a little plump. He guessed that Zhou Ming’s motives were probably not pure when he first got together with her.</p>
<p>Later, the girl’s parents went to reason with Zhou Ming and had even been injured by him. He really didn’t care about their past relationship.</p>
<p>Zhou Ming had done many such things in secret. He was a person who only wanted to climb up.</p>
<p>Wei Ge was reading when he suddenly heard the door to the archive room open and a person walk in.</p>
<p>Wei Ge was a very meticulous person. When he heard the gait, he felt that the person was somewhat different from those who often came to the archives. He hurriedly looked up and saw who it was. He immediately stood up and saluted. “Director-General, why are you here? If you need any files, just inform me. I’ll send them to you now.”</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi smiled. “There’s no need to be nervous. Let me take a look at Darkness Emissary’s file. Ah, it’s already here. So, you’re also interested. Not bad.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Shen Yuchi took the file on the table and stood there to flip through it.</p>
<p>“I happened to see that Darkness Emissary is up next in the fight, so I took it out to take a look and tidy it up,” Wei Ge said.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi nodded slightly and didn’t say anything. After reading a few pages, Shen Yuchi asked casually, “You are a top student at Sunset College. You should know Zhou Wen, right?”</p>
<p>Wei Ge immediately answered, “Yes, Director-General. Zhou Wen is my junior. When he entered the school, I was already the student council president.”</p>
<p>“Do you know much about him?” Shen Yuchi looked at the information and continued asking without looking up.</p>
<p>“I know a little. I originally wanted to pull him onto the student council, but he wasn’t interested,” Wei Ge said.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1053'>Chapter 1053: Where is He?</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>After Shen Yuchi left, the fearful expression on Wei Ge’s face vanished. He sat back down and picked up his teacup to slowly drink tea as he watched the livestream.</p>
<p>If one placed their ear close to Wei Ge’s mouth, one could hear him muttering to himself, “From the looks of it, my chance is finally here. I just don’t know if it’s a blessing or a curse.”</p>
<p>Battles that hadn’t been seen for more than a day were about to begin again. Many people were still looking forward to the outcome of this battle. The media had reported a little of Darkness Emissary’s abilities. He was indeed very strong. Furthermore, Zhou Ming had recently been very close to a local wealthy family. Perhaps he had already obtained a Mythical Companion Beast, so his strength was definitely not to be underestimated.</p>
<p>As for Grim Demon’s strength, it was unknown, but his human companion hadn’t participated. This was undoubtedly a huge disadvantage. Without a human’s participation, there were no Mythical Companion Beasts available to be used.</p>
<p>Grim Demon didn’t mind this. He looked at Zhou Ming, who had appeared in the arena in the Darkness Emissary armor, and said condescendingly, “I’m happy today. I’ll let you live a little longer. I’ll give you a two-move handicap before killing you.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen massaged his temples when he heard Grim Demon’s words, feeling a headache.</p>
<p>This bastard. Doesn’t he know that I’m stalling for time? If you want to kill him in three moves, how can I stall for time? Zhou Wen decided to summon Grim Demon back to reprimand him after the battle ended. He wanted him to figure out the importance of the holy edict.</p>
<p>Such a speech excited all the spectators in the Federation.</p>
<p>“Isn’t Grim Demon too arrogant?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps he really has the right to be arrogant. After all, his origins are definitely not simple. The person backing him has so many Mythical Companion Beasts.”</p>
<p>“You said it yourself. It’s his backer who isn’t appearing in battle. Without a human accompanying him, he can’t use Companion Beasts.”</p>
<p>Zhou Ming only sneered. Without any hesitation, he attacked.</p>
<p>The power of Darkness Emissary was different from Night Thearch’s. The moment Zhou Ming attacked, the Darkness Emissary armor on his body erupted with terrifying energy.</p>
<p>The energy condensed in the air above his head gradually transformed into a dark door. As time passed, the dark door became clearer and clearer. It emitted a terrifying dark aura like a door to hell.</p>
<p>Anyone could tell that using such a skill required a large amount of time to channel the strength. If it was a normal battle, Darkness Emissary wouldn’t have the time or opportunity to use such a skill.</p>
<p>However, as Grim Demon had actually given him a two-move handicap, Zhou Ming took the opportunity to use this skill.</p>
<p>Ordinary people knew that skills that required time to gather strength were typically very terrifying.</p>
<p>“Grim Demon really deserves it. I’m afraid it’s irrevocably committed now.”</p>
<p>“What a powerful Essence Energy fluctuation. It has such a powerful aura even before it’s fully formed. This strike must be extraordinary.”</p>
<p>After a few minutes, the dark door condensed above Zhou Ming’s head.</p>
<p>“As you wish. Let my Door of Darkness take you to the Seamless Abyss.” Zhou Ming finally spoke. Almost at the same time, the Door of Darkness opened.</p>
<p>A strange suction force was produced in the dark world behind the door, sucking everything nearby into the dark door.</p>
<p>Zhou Ming was very confident in this move. He had once used it to instantly kill an extremely powerful Mythical creature. The only pity was that after using this move, the Mythical creature was reduced to nothing, leaving no spoils behind.</p>
<p>Go to hell. This is the outcome of underestimating me. Zhou Ming sneered inwardly as he waited to see Grim Demon’s horrified expression when he was sucked into the Dark World.</p>
<p>But soon, the sneer on Zhou Ming’s face turned to horror.</p>
<p>Grim Demon floated in the air and moved. He continued looking down at him as though the suction force in the Door of Darkness didn’t exist.</p>
<p>Impossible… The suction force of the Dark World is enough to devour top Mythical creatures… How can this be… Zhou Ming was alarmed and furious. He gathered his strength and pushed the Door of Darkness closer to Grim Demon.</p>
<p>The closer the Door of Darkness was to Grim Demon, the greater the suction force of the Dark World. However, when the Door of Darkness was almost in front of Grim Demon, Grim Demon remained standing there motionless.</p>
<p>“Stop dawdling. You’ve still got one move left.” Grim Demon waved his hand and demonic aura surged, shattering the Door of Darkness.</p>
<p>Pfft!</p>
<p>However, at the same time as the Door of Darkness shattered, Zhou Ming spewed out blood as he fell backward.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Ming immediately surrendered and left the arena.</p>
<p>Instantly, all the spectators looked at Grim Demon in a daze. Their shock was indescribable.</p>
<p>Although Darkness Emissary wasn’t very strong, it was ranked in the top twenty. The attack he had channeled with all his might had been easily dispersed by Grim Demon, scaring Zhou Ming into admitting defeat.</p>
<p>Furthermore, anyone could tell that Grim Demon had no intention of doing anything to Zhou Ming. It was an unintentional strike.</p>
<p>“This Grim Demon… is so powerful…”</p>
<p>“D*mn, this is too ferocious.”</p>
<p>“Who is his contractor? I really want to know.”</p>
<p>“For real? Is the difference between Guardians that great?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen never expected Grim Demon to be so ferocious. With a casual wave of his hand, he had destroyed Darkness Emissary’s all-out strike.</p>
<p>The Terror grade is indeed powerful. Without the Terror transformation ability, even Mythical creatures are nothing. Yet, I’m not even considered nothing. How tragic. Zhou Wen wished he could immediately advance to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Grim Demon was depressed. He remembered that the Guardians of his era weren’t that weak.</p>
<p>He was originally prepared to unleash a massacre, but it ended before it even began.</p>
<p>What depressed Grim Demon even more was that none of the people who had been constantly challenging him previously challenged him again. The cube also lost its video broadcast because there were no Guardians challenging it again. It returned to the ranking menu.</p>
<p>On the rankings, Grim Demon was first, while Ya was second.</p>
<p>People waited for a while, but no one challenged Grim Demon again. That strike had stunned all the Guardians. Even if someone wanted to challenge him, they wouldn’t act rashly like before.</p>
<p>I never expected such an unexpected gain. Zhou Wen didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when he saw Grim Demon return.</p>
<p>He had previously wanted to reprimand Grim Demon, but he never expected that after Grim Demon’s ruckus, he would end up with more time. Perhaps he could while away the 48 hours.</p>
<p>“Well done,” Zhou Wen said as he patted Grim Demon on the shoulder.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>On the Internet, the scene of Grim Demon accidentally defeating Darkness Emissary had already become an emoji. Someone even added lines to the picture.</p>

<p>“Fight me… Eh… Where is he…”</p>

<p>Grim Demon’s name spread across the world. Many people were studying Grim Demon’s abilities, but because there was too little information, they failed to figure out anything.</p>
<p>With no Guardian continuing the challenge, Zhou Wen finally heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Grim Demon wasn’t happy at all. He sat by the side dejectedly and drew randomly on the ground with a tree branch. As he drew, he muttered softly, “Why isn’t anyone challenging me… Why isn’t anyone challenging me…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pretended not to hear him. It was normal for Demonic Neonate to come out to take a breather since he was locked inside the sword.</p>
<p>I hope no one will challenge me in the remaining twenty hours, Zhou Wen prayed inwardly.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden secretly sized up Grim Demon and was extremely shocked. Previously, she had thought that Grim Demon was only an accessory and that his abilities were definitely not very strong. Otherwise, how could he be willing to be the Guardian of a Companion Beast? But from the looks of it, Grim Demon was a genuine Terror-grade existence. This left her even more alarmed.</p>
<p>Even the Guardian of a Companion Beast is at the Terror grade? Ice Maiden had never heard of such a thing in the past, nor did she know how Zhou Wen had done it.</p>
<p>Time ticked by. No one challenged Grim Demon again. Almost forty-eight hours later, someone finally challenged Grim Demon again. However, the person who challenged was Ya.</p>
<p>“Someone is challenging me!” Grim Demon stood up excitedly and was about to rush to the cube.</p>
<p>“Admit defeat immediately after entering,” Zhou Wen said lightly.</p>
<p>Grim Demon immediately deflated like a balloon. He looked at Zhou Wen with a look of resentment and asked, “Why? Don’t you want to get first place?”</p>
<p>“No, do as I say.” Zhou Wen wasn’t completely uninterested in first place. However, he still didn’t know the benefits and disadvantages.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan had once told him not to take first place again, so up to now, Zhou Wen hadn’t made up his mind.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it wasn’t that easy to obtain first place. It was unknown if there were any Terror-grade Guardians that were participating. However, Night Thearch and the one from Forbidden City who hadn’t participated in the battle were definitely at the Terror grade. Perhaps such terrifying existences would take action in the final infinite battle.</p>
<p>It probably wouldn’t be easy for Zhong Ziya to maintain his first place.</p>
<p>“I guarantee that as long as you let me fight, I will obtain first place.” Grim Demon looked at Zhou Wen with anticipation.</p>
<p>“I’ll get your help when I want first place.” Zhou Wen looked at Demonic Neonate. Demonic Neonate seemed to understand Zhou Wen’s intentions as she glanced at Grim Demon.</p>
<p>Grim Demon immediately looked at the cube obediently and walked over. Zhou Wen exhorted, “Be careful when you go up. See if Ya will secretly pass you a message.”</p>
<p>“Got it,” Grim Demon answered listlessly as he entered the cube.</p>
<p>Ya didn’t pass any message. All he did was take back the first spot. If Zhou Wen had known that would happen, he wouldn’t have even sent Grim Demon. It was more straightforward to forfeit.</p>
<p>When the Federation citizens saw that first place had returned to Ya, they naturally understood that they were all in cahoots.</p>
<p>“Ya is already a Guardian. Grim Demon can’t be his, so who does Grim Demon belong to? If we can find Ya, we might be able to know who Grim Demon belongs to.”</p>
<p>“Which family are these people from? They have so many Mythical Companion Beasts, but they actually have Guardians like Ya and Grim Demon. It’s too terrifying.”</p>
<p>“Did you notice? Second place became Grim Demon, but after the Mythical Companion Beasts admitted defeat, they didn’t obtain a ranking. This is blatant discrimination.”</p>
<p>“What can we do about that? The future is the era of Guardians. Existences like Ya and Grim Demon are not something ordinary humans and Companion Beasts can deal with.”</p>
<p>“Instead of thinking about this, we might as well consider where to contract a Guardian that’s as powerful as Grim Demon.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw Ya make a gesture before disappearing. It was the gesture Zhong Ziya had used every time he won back when they played cards together.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen feel relieved. Although he didn’t know what Ya had done, it looked like he had succeeded.</p>
<p>After putting away Ice Maiden and Grim Demon, he was just about to find Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan when his phone suddenly rang. It was a message from The Thearch.</p>
<p>“You contracted with Grim Demon?” The omniscient Thearch seemed to have a question for the first time.</p>
<p>“I have nothing to do with Grim Demon. Why are you asking?” Zhou Wen replied.</p>
<p>“If there’s nothing between you, would he have cooperated with your Companion Beast to stall for time? If there’s nothing, would he have given first place to Ya?” The Thearch said disdainfully.</p>
<p>“There’s really nothing between us.” Zhou Wen didn’t wish to explain further lest he slipped up. With The Thearch’s shrewdness, she could easily guess something from his words.</p>
<p>“Although Grim Demon is very strong, contracting him is definitely not a good choice.” The Thearch seemed adamant that Zhou Wen was related to Grim Demon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. From The Thearch’s words, she seemed to know Grim Demon. Furthermore, Grim Demon was the first to be described as very strong by The Thearch.</p>
<p>Is Grim Demon really that strong? Zhou Wen had always felt that Grim Demon wasn’t that strong because he was too cowardly in front of Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen now felt that perhaps what Grim Demon had said in the past wasn’t pure bragging.</p>
<p>“Then who’s a good choice? You?” Zhou Wen replied.</p>
<p>“You aren’t qualified to contract me.” The Thearch’s answer was very arrogant.</p>
<p>However, these words seemed to admit that she was also a Guardian, but he couldn’t be sure. It was also possible that The Thearch had deliberately said this to mislead him.</p>
<p>“However, if you do me a favor, I can consider giving you a chance.” The Thearch sent another message.</p>
<p>“What chance?” Zhou Wen was alarmed, but he asked the obvious.</p>
<p>“A chance to contract the strongest Guardian,” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me the strongest Guardian you are talking about is yourself?” Zhou Wen replied.</p>
<p>“Guess.”</p>
<p>“I’m not interested in guessing.” Zhou Wen didn’t wish to play any guessing games with her. He bluntly said, “If the strongest Guardian you mentioned is you, I can consider it.”</p>
<p>The Thearch didn’t respond to the topic at hand. “Let’s continue our discussion after you obtain the Dimensional Wheel.”</p>
<p>“If I can obtain the Dimensional Wheel, I’ll be the Lord of Earth. What’s there to talk about?” Zhou Wen probed.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you really think that you will be the Lord of Earth after getting first place?” The Thearch replied.</p>
<p>“Didn’t they say that the Dimensional Wheel will bestow immense power? With absolute power, one will naturally be the Lord of Earth. Aren’t you also interested in the Dimensional Wheel?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep talking until you obtain the Dimensional Wheel,” The Thearch replied before going offline. She didn’t reply to Zhou Wen’s messages.</p>
<p>What does she want? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1055'>Chapter 1055: Landing on the Moon</h3>

<p>After Ya went on stage, the Guardians began challenging him again. Ya was the same as before. No matter who challenged him, he would accept the challenge.</p>
<p>However, this time, Ya didn’t immediately accept the challenges one after another. He would always rest for some time to maintain an optimal state.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had also watched a few of Ya’s battles and found him very strong. He couldn’t find any weaknesses. Together with the puppet avatar and other strange skills, he was virtually invincible.</p>
<p>Guardian after Guardian was defeated by Ya, but there were still Guardians constantly challenging him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t continue watching. It was almost time to head to Sky Pass to meet Shen Yuchi and head to the Moon.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan took Ya’er and followed Wang Lu back to the Wang family. Zhou Wen went to Sky Pass alone.</p>
<p>Although Mythical creatures could also fly into space, humans had weak physiques. It was safer to take a rocket. Shen Yuchi had been preparing for the launch of the rocket for the past few days.</p>
<p>In fact, he had begun making preparations after the lunar incident. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for him to complete the preparations for a manned rocket launch in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>After arriving at the Sky Pass, Shen Yuchi personally received Zhou Wen. What surprised Zhou Wen was that Wei Ge was following Shen Yuchi.</p>
<p>“Isn’t this President Wei? Why are you here?” Zhou Wen asked Wei Ge.</p>
<p>Wei Ge smiled and said, “I’m now an inspector at the bureau. I wanted to inform you, but I don’t have your contact number. I haven’t been able to contact you. You have to give me your phone number later.”</p>
<p>“Since you are classmates, you should build on your relationship in the future.” Shen Yuchi smiled and said, “In the future, Little Wei will be in charge of our bureau’s liaison with you. Do you have any objections?”</p>
<p>“I have no objections. President Wei is quite good. He’s a very capable person. Your bureau sure is filled with talent,” Zhou Wen said with a faint smile.</p>
<p>“If you are interested, the bureau’s door is always open to you,” Shen Yuchi said.</p>
<p>“Forget it. I can’t be restrained. I’m different from others,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi stopped talking about this matter and said, “The rocket will be launched at 3:10 AM. There’s still some time to prepare. Perhaps you can rest first. Little Wei, take good care of Zhou Wen.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Director-General.” Wei Ge saluted.</p>
<p>After Shen Yuchi left, he went to a room. There was a surveillance video playing in the room. The woman with the nickname of Button was sitting there watching the surveillance footage.</p>
<p>“Noticed anything?” Shen Yuchi sat down and asked.</p>
<p>“This Wei Ge is a smooth and slick person. He’s naturally good at gathering intelligence,” said Button.</p>
<p>“He does have some talent. If I can take him under my wing, he might be able to achieve great things in the future,” Shen Yuchi said.</p>
<p>“You don’t trust him?” asked Button, having noticed something.</p>
<p>“Although according to the investigations, he really has nothing to do with Zhou Wen and even had some conflicts in secret, it’s best to be careful,” Shen Yuchi said.</p>
<p>“So you got Wei Ge to follow Zhou Wen to test him?” Button pondered.</p>
<p>“Not entirely. It was better to have someone who knows Zhou Wen follow him than someone who knows nothing about him,” Shen Yuchi said.</p>
<p>“That’s true. Then what do you want me to do?” Buttons nodded before asking again.</p>
<p>“Stay behind on our trip to the Moon,” Shen Yuchi said.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid you’ll be in danger if I’m not with you,” said Button.</p>
<p>“I need you to do something. I can’t let you expose yourself to them.” Shen Yuchi looked at Button and reached out to straighten the slightly wrinkled clothes on her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Does what you want me to do have something to do with Zhou Wen?” Button asked.</p>
<p>“No, it has nothing to do with him, but it’s best not to let him see you.”</p>
<p>“Then what do you want me to do?” Button was surprised that she had guessed wrong.</p>
<p>“If Wei Ge returns alive, I want you to think of a way to stay by his side,” Shen Yuchi said casually.</p>
<p>Button’s body trembled imperceptibly, but she immediately returned to normal. “Why? Even if he has some relationship with Zhou Wen, it’s not worth wasting too much time and energy on him, right?”</p>
<p>“This is my decision. You can choose to carry it out or return to where you came from,” Shen Yuchi took two steps back and said as he sized up the well-pressed clothes on Button.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll do it. But at the very least, you have to tell me what I should investigate, right?” Button gritted her teeth and said.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to investigate or do anything. You just need to gain his trust and wait for the day I need you,” Shen Yuchi said calmly.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know why they had to launch the rocket at night.</p>
<p>He was rather curious when he first entered the rocket cabin. Although it wasn’t rare for people to fly in the sky or burrow into the ground in this era, it was still very nerve-wracking and exciting to be on a rocket.</p>
<p>Apart from Zhou Wen, there were eight other members, including Shen Yuchi and Wei Ge.</p>
<p>As for the four Censors, Zhou Wen didn’t know any of them. The other six were unfamiliar faces.</p>
<p>Everything was ready. After the countdown ended, the rocket flew into the sky. Zhou Wen was originally nervous and expectant, but he soon realized that the feeling of riding a rocket wasn’t as magical as he had imagined.</p>
<p>It could even be said to be boring because he couldn’t see anything in the cabin. He couldn’t experience the feeling of leaving Earth and watching it shrink.</p>
<p>I looked forward to it for nothing. Zhou Wen suddenly felt that it was better to fly out of Earth on a Companion Beast after he advanced to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>The rocket launch was very successful. Soon, they entered a predetermined orbit. Everything seemed to be developing in a good direction.</p>
<p>However, everyone knew that their fate would only be decided when they reached the Moon.</p>
<p>Up to now, they still hadn’t figured out what the creature that had destroyed the lunar base was, nor had they discovered any other dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>More than 70 hours later, Zhou Wen and company successfully landed on the Moon, but they were still a distance away from the base.</p>
<p>Apart from two people staying behind, Shen Yuchi, Zhou Wen, and company headed for the lunar base.</p>
<p>This landing was simple. They hadn’t brought any tools like lunar rovers. In fact, they wouldn’t need to use them. Mythical Companion Beasts were much more useful here than lunar rovers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that he could see more stars on the Moon, but now, he realized that what he could see was rather limited. It was far inferior to what he could see on Earth. It didn’t match his expectations.</p>
<p>“President Wei, do you want to ride with me?” Zhou Wen summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull and invited Wei Ge.</p>
<p>Wei Ge looked at Shen Yuchi and saw him nod slightly. Only then did he smile and said into the communicator, “Alright.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1056'>Chapter 1056: Bone Pottery</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Everyone was nervous because this was the Moon. If anything happened, just damage to the space suits could result in their deaths.</p>
<p>After arriving on the Moon, they had already used radar to scan the area, but they didn’t find anything abnormal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare be careless. He kept Truth Listener on, but here, Truth Listener’s ability seemed to be affected. It wasn’t as useful as on Earth.</p>
<p>Everyone felt uneasy as they headed for the base.</p>
<p>With a Mythical Companion Beast mount, they moved quickly. The Great Might Vajra Bull quickly adapted to the gravity here and ran no slower than on Earth.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi also summoned a Mythical Companion Beast. It was a giant rhinoceros. It was more than enough for the rest to sit on.</p>
<p>Although they had already seen the photos, they were still shocked by the scene before them when they arrived at the base.</p>
<p>The base that was hundreds of meters long had been squashed into a pit by some creature. Most of the buildings were flattened. Even if they weren’t flattened, they were crushed into the rock stratum.</p>
<p>There was no need to look. It was impossible for there to be a living person inside.</p>
<p>However, there were no dimensional creatures around. After Shen Yuchi communicated with everyone, he planned on heading straight to the Essence Crystal mine, which was also the spot where the tree stump had been found.</p>
<p>Similarly, when they arrived at the Essence Crystal mine, they didn’t find any dimensional creatures, nor did they see any astronauts.</p>
<p>There were quite a number of Essence Crystal ores scattered on the ground. In the excavation crater, there were also quite a number of Essence Crystals shimmering with a charming luster.</p>
<p>“It’s gone!” an inspector named Wang Qiuyuan said as he stared into the mine.</p>
<p>Everyone knew what he was talking about. Previously, the huge pit was where the tree stump was. As its roots were spread out, they had dug a huge pit.</p>
<p>But now, there was only a huge crater left. The tree stump had gone.</p>
<p>Everyone’s hearts turned cold. Without the petals and the tree stump, their trip was equivalent to a wasted trip.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Zhou Wen saw something strange as he looked at a corner of the mine.</p>
<p>Everyone traced Zhou Wen’s gaze and saw something in a huge hole in the mine.</p>
<p>However, their eyesight wasn’t as strong as Zhou Wen’s, so they couldn’t see what it was.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, can you see what it is?” Shen Yuchi asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“It looks like a human’s back is facing us, but it doesn’t look like a human,” Zhou Wen said as he organized his words.</p>
<p>“What do you mean it looks like a human, but not a human?” Wei Ge asked.</p>
<p>“I can’t see the front. His back looks like a human, and he’s wearing ordinary human clothes. But this is the Moon. How can a human sit here in ordinary clothes?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Everyone used the binocular function of their helmets to take a closer look. Indeed, they saw a figure sitting with his back facing the cave entrance. They could only see his back, but they couldn’t confirm if he was really human.</p>
<p>“Retreat. Let the Companion Beasts take a look.” Shen Yu ordered his Companion Beasts to approach.</p>
<p>Everyone felt a little uneasy as they watched the rhinoceros slowly approach. However, the figure remained motionless.</p>
<p>The rhinoceros walked to the side of the figure, but the figure still remained motionless.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi frowned slightly and didn’t let the rhinoceros attack. “Wang Qiuyuan, go take a look.”</p>
<p>Wang Qiuyuan responded and carefully looked over and approached.</p>
<p>“Director-General, it’s a human, a dead human, but this place is a little strange…” Wang Qiuyuan said in surprise after circling around the person sitting there.</p>
<p>He sounded very surprised, as if he had discovered something unbelievable.</p>
<p>“What’s strange?” Shen Yuchi immediately asked.</p>
<p>“Fire, there’s fire here.” Wang Qiuyuan’s voice sounded from the communicator.</p>
<p>Everyone was alarmed when they heard that. Logically speaking, it was impossible to ignite a flame on the moon. Therefore, it was indeed strange for Wang Qiuyuan to say that there was a fire there.</p>
<p>“Do you know that person? Is he an astronaut from before?” Shen Yuchi asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know him. I don’t think he’s an astronaut from before. His looks are a little strange, and his clothes are also very strange…” Wang Qiuyuan couldn’t describe him accurately.</p>
<p>“Survey the surroundings. Report any situation immediately. We’ll head over now.” Shen Yuchi led everyone over.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company were very careful. There was actually a person without a space suit sitting there. This was very strange to begin with, making them feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Everyone carefully came to the cave and indeed, they saw a dead person. His flesh and blood were shriveled, and his face and clothes were covered in dust. He looked like he had been dead for a long time.</p>
<p>He looked like someone from the East District, but his cheekbones were especially high and his eyes were deep. He was somewhat different from East District people.</p>
<p>His hair remained relatively intact. Under the dust, one could tell that his hair was black.</p>
<p>The style of his clothes was very strange. It looked like a robe with long, wide sleeves. They didn’t look like the clothes worn by modern people.</p>
<p>This wasn’t too strange. The strangest thing was that there was a white jar in front of the person’s toes. It was at most twenty centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>Inside the white jar was a tiny flame that looked like a lighter’s flame.</p>
<p>Although the flame was very small, it gave off a magical feeling. This was the Moon. There was no oxygen, yet the tiny flame was burning steadily. This was very unusual.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Shen Yuchi. He was the leader of this operation. Now that he had encountered such a strange matter, he naturally needed to make a decision.</p>
<p>“Don’t touch him. First, explore the area and see if there are any other discoveries,” Shen Yuchi said as he sized up the white jar.</p>
<p>“Director-General Shen, did you notice something amiss?” Zhou Wen asked Shen Yuchi.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi said, “Have you seen this jar before?”</p>
<p>“No.” Zhou Wen had already taken a careful look and couldn’t tell what the jar was made of.</p>
<p>It looked a little like jade, but it wasn’t that exquisite. Saying that it was made of clay wasn’t right due to its luster.</p>
<p>“If I’m not wrong, it should be bone pottery, a special kind of pottery,” Shen Yuchi said.</p>
<p>“Are bone pottery and bone porcelain the same thing?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>He had heard of bone porcelain. Because of the addition of bone powder, the porcelain that was produced under heat could be made thinner, harder, and more beautiful.</p>
<p>“It’s not the same. Bone porcelain uses bone powder as the raw material. Bone pottery doesn’t use bone powder as the raw material to make the pottery. Instead, it’s pottery made from blood and blood sacrifices. It’s also called blood pottery or corpse pottery.” Shen Yuchi continued with a solemn expression, “In the past, I saw an expert’s collection. He had bone pottery. According to him, bone pottery is usually used in ancient rituals. Ordinary people have no chance of coming into contact with such things.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1057'>Chapter 1057: Invisible Dimensional Creature</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Were ancient humans capable of coming to the Moon to offer sacrifices?” Zhou Wen asked as he looked at the corpse.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. If you had asked me this question before now, the answer would definitely have been no. But from the looks of it now, even without rockets and other equipment, humans might have had the ability to reach the Moon.” Shen Yuchi shook his head slightly.</p>
<p>Under Shen Yuchi’s command, everyone left the cave and continued searching for useful clues nearby.</p>
<p>Among the people from the bureau, there were professional investigators. They were much more professional than Zhou Wen, so he didn’t focus on the investigations.</p>
<p>He slowly walked on the moon as he switched his Life Soul to Glimmer.</p>
<p>He could clearly sense that the Glimmer Life Soul was growing, but this growth wasn’t enough for it to break through to a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>Could it be that I have to use Glimmer’s interstellar teleportation ability to advance to a Perfect Body? Zhou Wen now roughly understood how Glimmer could advance. He felt relieved.</p>
<p>The Glimmer Life Soul already had the power to advance. It was only because he had never used Glimmer’s ability that he was unable to break through the final barrier.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen only needed to use interstellar teleportation once to advance to perfection.</p>
<p>If I were to use Glimmer to teleport back to Earth, I should be able to advance to a Perfect Body. Zhou Wen could sense that there was no mistake.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen planned on teleporting back to Earth after the matters on the Moon were over, allowing Glimmer to advance to a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi and company kept investigating and had already discovered many clues. According to the current clues, the previous astronauts had been attacked by an unknown creature when they dug out the tree stump.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the measurements of the mine, they discovered that there should be a natural pit hole under the tree stump. The creature that had attacked the astronauts was likely hiding in that natural pit hole.</p>
<p>“Director-General, there’s something very strange,” Wang Qiuyuan said as he surveyed the area.</p>
<p>“Speak.” Shen Yuchi and company looked at Wang Qiuyuan.</p>
<p>“There aren’t any astronaut corpses at the scene, nor are there any signs of a fight. This means that the dimensional creature is very powerful. It can directly devour them or forcefully detain them. However, look at these footprints. These footprints belong to that Mythical Companion Beast. These belong to those astronauts.” Wang Qiuyuan pointed at the footprints. “If we were to encounter a powerful dimensional creature, even if we were quickly devoured after discovering it, we would subconsciously retreat. Even if we didn’t take a step forward, the center of gravity for the step will shift. This should be obvious from the changes in the footprints.</p>
<p>“But from the looks of it, there’s no sign of that at all. It’s as though they didn’t see any terrifying creature, and were devoured without realizing what was happening.”</p>
<p>Everyone looked carefully at the footprints on the ground and realized that this was indeed the case.</p>
<p>“What do you think of this situation?” Shen Yuchi asked Wang Qiuyuan.</p>
<p>“I’m certain that they didn’t see the dimensional creature. It’s possible that the dimensional creature has invisibility, or it might have hidden somewhere and launched an attack when they weren’t prepared.” Wang Qiuyuan scanned his surroundings. “If that thing has invisibility, we have to be careful. Perhaps it’s watching us from somewhere nearby.”</p>
<p>Everyone was alarmed as Zhou Wen’s reaction was the greatest.</p>
<p>This was because he knew that the dimensional creature might not be invisible, but because its life form was so advanced—this resulted in them being unable to see it.</p>
<p>In other words, that dimensional creature might be a Terror-grade existence.</p>
<p>Is there really a Terror-grade monster hiding on the Moon? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he and Truth Listener scanned their surroundings at the same time, but they didn’t discover anything. However, this only made him even more alarmed.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, what’s your take?” Shen Yuchi pondered for a moment before his gaze landed on Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I think it’s best we leave this place quickly.” Zhou Wen was originally interested in the petals and tree stump, but now that they were gone and that there might still be a Terror-grade creature here, it wasn’t suitable for him to continue taking risks in such an environment.</p>
<p>“Let’s head back now.” Shen Yuchi had just given the order when he suddenly heard a tragic cry.</p>
<p>The screams coming from the communicator were short, as if someone had grabbed the person by his throat just as he had started shouting.</p>
<p>Everyone was alarmed as they looked around, but they didn’t discover anything. They didn’t find any dimensional creatures or blood. No one even discovered anyone injured.</p>
<p>However, one of them was missing. A perfectly fine person had vanished beside them.</p>
<p>“Lu Dong… Lu Dong…” Everyone felt their souls leap out of their bodies. As Shen Yuchi summoned his Companion Beast to stand guard, he shouted for the vanished inspector.</p>
<p>No response. The communicator was terrifyingly quiet, as though the inspector had been erased from the world.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate to release Ice Maiden. At that moment, he was almost certain that the dimensional creature on the moon was likely a Terror-grade existence.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi and company, who were feeling nervous, were shocked when they suddenly saw a woman beside Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, when they saw Zhou Wen’s behavior, they imagined that the woman was Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast, but her aura didn’t seem right.</p>
<p>At times like this, no one was in the mood to investigate if the woman was a Companion Beast or something else. Shen Yuchi immediately gave the order to evacuate.</p>
<p>“It’s best you don’t go over.” Zhou Wen stood there without moving because Ice Maiden’s eyes were looking in the direction of their retreat. Furthermore, she looked rather solemn.</p>
<p>“What did you discover?” Wei Ge stopped and asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“That thing should be over there,” Zhou Wen said as he looked in the direction that Ice Maiden was looking.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi and company hurriedly retreated. Shen Yuchi looked at Zhou Wen and asked, “Can you see it?”</p>
<p>“I can’t see it, but she can.” Zhou Wen looked at Ice Maiden and asked, “How is it? What is it? Are you confident?”</p>
<p>“It’s very tricky. Even if I can win, I’m afraid I won’t be able to protect you,” Ice Maiden said.</p>
<p>So it’s really at the Terror grade? Zhou Wen no longer had any doubt. To make Ice Maiden say such words, it had to be at the Terror grade.</p>
<p>“Director-General Shen, it looks like we can only escape separately.” Zhou Wen wanted to summon the Earth Elemental Beast and planned on using its Earth Escape ability to escape.</p>
<p>“Whoever moves first will become its target,” Ice Maiden said again.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Ice Maiden’s words, Zhou Wen had no choice but to give up summoning the Earth Elemental Beast and stood there motionless.</p>
<p>Even though Zhou Wen didn’t move, someone didn’t believe him. An inspector summoned an Epic Companion Beast that could fly. He wanted to use its power to escape in another direction.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1058'>Chapter 1058: Wei Ge’s Decision</h3>

<p>However, as he flew up, he suddenly vanished along with his Companion Beast as though he had been devoured by an invisible monster.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that the dimensional creature is over there?” Wang Qiuyuan said in horror.</p>
<p>“It’s still there,” Ice Maiden said expressionlessly.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi’s expression changed constantly. He suddenly turned around and ran. At the same time, he ordered, “Follow me.”</p>
<p>Wang Qiuyuan didn’t hesitate and ran with Shen Yuchi. Wei Ge followed as well. Zhou Wen only thought for a moment before following.</p>
<p>The few of them jumped into the mineshaft together. Shen Yuchi led the way and rushed towards the dead person they had previously discovered.</p>
<p>When they got to the side of the corpse, they were already covered in cold sweat.</p>
<p>Thankfully, they had made the right bet. The invisible dimensional creature didn’t attack them.</p>
<p>“Director-General, what should we do now?” Wang Qiuyuan asked Shen Yuchi.</p>
<p>“We can’t leave now.” Shen Yuchi looked at the dead person and the Bone Pottery jar in front of him. “Perhaps our chance for survival lies here.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had to admit that Shen Yuchi was indeed the head of the bureau. He was bold, careful, and quick-witted.</p>
<p>All the nearby creatures had been devoured, but this sitting dead person hadn’t been affected at all. Therefore, Shen Yuchi took a gamble. From the looks of it, he had made the right bet.</p>
<p>At the very least, the Terror-grade creature didn’t immediately attack them or chase after them.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” Ice Maiden had also joined in their retreat. She didn’t attack the terrifying creature. From the looks of it, she didn’t have much confidence. Otherwise, she would have attacked without retreating.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. A dead person that was originally here,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That creature seems to be afraid of something here. It hasn’t approached,” Ice Maiden said as she looked nearby.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, my guess should be correct. Perhaps the things here can help us escape.” Shen Yuchi’s gaze landed on the Bone Pottery jar.</p>
<p>Of the things here, the Bone Pottery jar was naturally the most magical. The tiny flame in the altar was still burning as though it wouldn’t be affected by any external force.</p>
<p>If there was anything here that could affect the Terror creature, this was most likely the culprit.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company stared at the Bone Pottery jar, but no one took it.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden didn’t know what it was as she constantly sized up the Bone Pottery jar and the dead man.</p>
<p>“Director-General, we have limited oxygen. We have to make a decision soon,” Wang Qiuyuan said as he stared at the Bone Pottery jar.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, what’s your take?” Shen Yuchi didn’t immediately make a decision. Instead, he looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“This thing is a little odd. It’s best not to touch it,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi clearly didn’t want to take the risk and wanted Zhou Wen to give it a try. The stronger something was, the more dangerous it was. But, before figuring out what it was, Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to touch it either.</p>
<p>After all, it might be something that could intimidate Terror creatures. Since even Terror creatures were afraid of it, Epic humans might be courting death if they came into contact with it.</p>
<p>“Now that we are in the same boat, we should work together to tide through this crisis. Otherwise, everyone might die here.” Shen Yuchi paused before saying, “Why don’t we do this? Let’s draw lots and choose someone to come into contact with the Bone Pottery jar. What do you think?”</p>
<p>“If you want to draw lots, you can do so yourselves. There’s no need to count me in,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Wang Qiuyuan frowned and said, “Why aren’t you counted? Should we take the risk and let you reap the benefits?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head and said, “I don’t need to reap the benefits. This is because I’m confident of escaping back to Earth alive, so I don’t need to take the risk.”</p>
<p>Wang Qiuyuan opened his mouth, but he couldn’t say a word. His expression didn’t look good.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen indeed had the right to say such things. After all, Ice Maiden—who was of unknown origins—was the only one among them who could see the dimensional creature. Furthermore, she remained unharmed despite staring at it.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi nodded. “That’s right. Zhou Wen, you aren’t from our bureau. There’s no need for you to take the risk with us. In that case, let’s draw lots.”</p>
<p>“Director-General, there’s no need to draw. Let me give it a try,” Wei Ge suddenly said.</p>
<p>“Although I’m the director-general of the bureau, I don’t have the right to let my subordinates risk their lives. Let’s draw lots,” Shen Yuchi said.</p>
<p>“Ever since the day I joined the bureau, I’ve been prepared to risk my life,” Wei Ge said calmly. “I’m the weakest person here. My chances of survival are the lowest. Please allow me to do something within my abilities for the bureau. If I’m lucky enough not to die, I hope you can remember my tiny contribution. If I die, there’s no need to mention anything else.”</p>
<p>“This…” Shen Yuchi pondered.</p>
<p>“Please fulfill my wish, Director-General.” Wei Ge bowed.</p>
<p>“Whatever then. What other unfulfilled wishes do you have? If we are lucky enough to escape, I will definitely help you complete them,” Shen Yuchi said as he glanced at Zhou Wen from the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>At this moment, Shen Yuchi hadn’t forgotten to observe Zhou Wen’s reaction.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen stood there expressionlessly. This was because before Wei Ge spoke, he had secretly made a gesture that only Zhou Wen could see, telling him not to act rashly.</p>
<p>“Thank you for fulfilling my wish, Director-General. If I am to die here, I hope you can take care of my family when you return. I’ll be very grateful,” Wei Ge said.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. Our bureau will definitely not treat meritorious employees unfairly. If anything happens to you, the bureau will definitely let your family live a comfortable life,” Shen Yuchi said solemnly.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Director-General. I’m relieved.” With that said, Wei Ge walked towards the Bone Pottery jar.</p>
<p>He walked to the side of the jar and slowly squatted down to carefully examine the Bone Pottery jar.</p>
<p>President Wei shouldn’t be someone who will sacrifice himself for the bureau. Zhou Wen was somewhat worried for Wei Ge, but Wei Ge’s secret gesture was telling Zhou Wen that he could handle it.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi and Wang Qiuyuan looked at Wei Ge nervously. Shen Yuchi didn’t forget to observe Zhou Wen. Seeing that Zhou Wen was only watching coldly without any reaction, his doubts about Wei Ge were basically gone.</p>
<p>Wei Ge sized it up for a while, but he didn’t seem to discover anything. Finally, he gritted his teeth and extended his hands towards the Bone Pottery har, hoping to lift it up.</p>
<p>If the dimensional creature was really afraid of the Bone Pottery jar, they could return to the spacecraft and leave the Moon with it.</p>
<p>The moment Wei Ge held the Bone Pottery jar with both hands, the tiny flame inside suddenly spewed out, turning into a terrifying flame that shot into the sky.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1059'>Chapter 1059: Moon Palace</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>In an instant, the fire enveloped Wei Ge, who was holding the Bone Pottery, turning him into a flaming man. The space suit instantly reduced to ashes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was given a fright as he immediately instructed Ice Maiden to save him. Her strength was most effective against fire-elemental attacks, but Ice Maiden didn’t move as she stared at Wei Ge.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that something was amiss. On careful look, he saw that the flames had already flowed into Wei Ge’s body. The flames weren’t burning from the outside, but from the inside out.</p>
<p>Now, Wei Ge’s body was like a flaming man. It was as though flames had seeped into every inch of his cells. As for the Bone Pottery artifact in his hand, it had turned to ashes in the flames.</p>
<p>The corpse beside him also disintegrated. He didn’t go up in flames, but was reduced to ashes. This gave Zhou Wen a very bad feeling.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi and Wang Qiuyuan also looked at Wei Ge in horror. Although the flames on Wei Ge’s body were terrifying, they didn’t hear him cry out in pain.</p>
<p>“I… am finally back…” The flames gradually converged into Wei Ge’s body. His body remained unharmed in the fire as he spoke.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t hear Wei Ge’s voice. His tone and intonation were completely different from Wei Ge’s.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Zhou Wen stared at Wei Ge and asked.</p>
<p>Now, he regretted not stopping Wei Ge. Although the two of them hadn’t interacted much, they were schoolmates. Zhou Wen still felt somewhat uncomfortable seeing him being possessed by an unknown creature.</p>
<p>“Who am I?” The flames on Wei Ge’s body had almost completely extinguished as he returned to his original appearance. Although his appearance hadn’t changed, for some reason, Zhou Wen felt that the present Wei Ge was completely different.</p>
<p>He looked up at the universe and said in a strange tone, “I’m not human.”</p>
<p>“What are you?” Zhou Wen looked at Wei Ge as countless thoughts flashed through his mind. He couldn’t think of any way to help Wei Ge retrieve his body.</p>
<p>“I’m human,” Wei Ge said slowly.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that you aren’t human?” Zhou Wen looked at him in puzzlement. He increasingly felt that Wei Ge was in danger. Not only was the thing attached to him a monster, but it was also a mentally ill monster.</p>
<p>Wei Ge didn’t answer Zhou Wen. He turned his head to look in the direction of Earth, but because this was the back of the Moon, he couldn’t see Earth.</p>
<p>“Is Earth still around?” Wei Ge asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Of course it’s still here, but we can’t see it from this side of the Moon.” Zhou Wen found it even stranger.</p>
<p>“That’s good. I should still be in time,” Wei Ge muttered to himself. As he spoke, he walked out.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” Zhou Wen exchanged looks with Ice Maiden and followed him.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi and Wang Qiuyuan hurriedly followed. Due to Wei Ge’s existence, the invisible dimensional creature didn’t attack them. If they were far away from him, they would probably be attacked again.</p>
<p>This existence that occupied Wei Ge’s “body” didn’t seem to be as offensive as the dimensional creature.</p>
<p>“Take back my Companion Beast,” Wei Ge said as he walked, as though he didn’t care about Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>He didn’t walk quickly, as though he was familiarizing himself with this body.</p>
<p>Wei Ge was already at the Epic stage, but Epic humans didn’t have the ability to survive on the Moon. However, now that he was walking naked on the Moon, it was as though he was walking as freely as back on Earth.</p>
<p>“Where is your Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen guessed the creature under the tree stump might be his Companion Beast.</p>
<p>If he could subdue it, their danger would be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>However, now that Wei Ge was possessed by him, Zhou Wen didn’t know if he could recover.</p>
<p>Thinking back to when Wei Ge left school, he had once said that he would find his life meaningful if he was lucky enough to barely defeat the heavens.</p>
<p>But now, he was already doomed without doing anything. He didn’t know if there would be a day when he could realize his value.</p>
<p>Wei Ge didn’t answer as he continued walking forward. He was walking in the direction where Zhou Wen and company had previously encountered the invisible creature.</p>
<p>“That Terror creature is retreating. It seems to be afraid of this person,” Ice Maiden whispered to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that Terror creature his Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen whispered.</p>
<p>“That’s a Terror-grade dimensional creature. It’s naturally impossible for it to be a Companion Beast.” Ice Maiden paused before saying, “This person seems very strong.”</p>
<p>“I also know that he’s very strong. Now, I just want to know if there’s any hope for Wei Ge to live?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid it’s impossible to retrieve his body,” Ice Maiden answered firmly.</p>
<p>Soon, Wei Ge returned to the spot where the tree stump had been dug out. He stood in front of the huge hole and stared at it. A strange divine light shot out from his eyes like two divine lamps. When the light shone into the hole, a strange change immediately happened inside.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen and company saw a figure gradually condense in the hole. It was a huge dark-gold toad.</p>
<p>“In the legends of the East District, the Moon is also called Toad Palace. Legend has it that there’s a golden toad inside. Could it be that this is the legendary golden toad?” Shen Yuchi said as he stared at the golden toad.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had roughly guessed that the one who had devoured the astronauts and inspectors was most likely the golden toad. However, he didn’t know what power Wei Ge had used to make the Terror creature show itself.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen realized that Wei Ge’s target wasn’t the golden toad. His gaze shone into the hole, revealing an ancient jade door where the mine’s wall originally stood.</p>
<p>The jade door was crystalline and emitted infinite coldness. Zhou Wen looked carefully and saw that on the plaque above the door’s brow were the words “Moon Palace.”</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, there’s really a Moon Palace. Could Chang’e and Moon Rabbit be inside? Zhou Wen was surprised when he swept his gaze across the corner of the plaque. His surprise turned into disbelief.</p>
<p>In the corner of the plaque was a tiny palm symbol. The tiny palm symbol held the moon symbol.</p>
<p>There’s actually a tiny palm symbol here! Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised. This was an unexpected gain.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi and company also looked at Moon Palace in surprise. Although it wasn’t strange for mythical places to appear in this era, seeing the legendary Moon Palace still sent palpitations through their hearts. After all, the legend of Moon Palace was famous in the East District.</p>
<p>The divine light in Wei Ge’s eyes vanished as he slowly walked towards the Moon Palace. After taking a few steps, the golden toad opened its mouth and extended its python-like tongue towards Wei Ge.</p>
<p>Wei Ge extended his hand and beckoned. Flames immediately appeared in his hand, condensing into a flaming ax that severed the golden toad’s tongue.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1060'>Chapter 1060: Two Illogical Points</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The golden toad’s tongue was severed by the ax. Blood immediately spewed out from its mouth as it let out a shrill cry.</p>
<p>And at the spot where its tongue was severed, flames burned. When the blood spewed into the air, it also burned like fireworks.</p>
<p>How powerful! Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>Even Ice Maiden didn’t dare underestimate the strength of the golden toad, but Wei Ge had chopped off its tongue with an ax. This was just too terrifying.</p>
<p>Wait… Axe… Lunar Osmanthus Tree… Could the one possessing Wei Ge be the legendary logger? Zhou Wen looked at Wei Ge in surprise.</p>
<p>The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that it was possible. In myths and legends, the logger was a human. As he had committed a huge mistake during his immortal cultivation, he had been punished by the furious Celestial Thearch. He was only allowed to leave after he had chopped down the osmanthus tree on the moon.</p>
<p>However, the osmanthus tree on the moon wasn’t an ordinary tree species. Instead, it was a type of undying tree. When the ax was pulled back after a chop, the wound on the tree automatically healed.</p>
<p>Therefore, the logger ended up logging on the Moon forever, never to leave the Moon again.</p>
<p>This was only one of the versions of the punished logger legend. Zhou Wen originally didn’t believe it, but now that such a person had appeared, it was difficult not to connect them together.</p>
<p>However, according to legend, it’s impossible for the osmanthus tree to be chopped down. Why is there only a tree stump now? How did the logger die? Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was still pondering, the injured golden toad retreated into the Moon Palace. The possessed Wei Ge also walked in.</p>
<p>“If you want to leave, this is the best opportunity,” Ice Maiden informed them.</p>
<p>“Director-General Shen, are you returning to the spacecraft?” Zhou Wen asked Shen Yuchi.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi pondered and said, “Little Wei made such a huge sacrifice. Since he can still be saved, we can’t abandon him. We have to think of a way.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He never expected Shen Yuchi to say such a thing.</p>
<p>“In that case, are you going in to save him?” Zhou Wen stared at Shen Yuchi and asked.</p>
<p>“I can only say that I’m going in to take a look. If there’s a chance, I’ll save him. If there’s no chance, I won’t throw my life away. I’ll just do my best. You and Wei Ge are also schoolmates. You won’t abandon him, right?”</p>
<p>“We were only from the same school and not from the same class. We didn’t have much interaction and don’t have any ties. Save him yourself. I’m not in the mood to take the risk,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi was slightly taken aback, but he didn’t say anything else. He led Wang Qiuyuan into the Moon Palace.</p>
<p>After they entered, Zhou Wen took out his phone and snapped a picture of the tiny palm symbol behind the words “Moon Palace.”</p>
<p>With a click, the phone screen showed the download interface.</p>
<p>I wonder if Chang’e is really in the Moon Palace. It should be very interesting when the Chang’e Companion Beast drops, right? Zhou Wen saw that his phone was constantly on the downloading screen. It didn’t seem like it could be downloaded in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Should I enter? Zhou Wen looked at the door of Moon Palace. The cold air inside was like fog, preventing him from seeing anything. Truth Listener’s ability couldn’t penetrate it either.</p>
<p>“If I were you, I wouldn’t choose to enter,” Ice Maiden suddenly said.</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen looked at Ice Maiden.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden said, “The existence that possessed your classmate is too powerful. The golden toad’s strength isn’t weaker than the present me, but he can heavily injure it with a mere strike. With such strength, even Grim Demon might not be able to emerge victorious if he were to fight. It’s best you consider it carefully.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Ice Maiden continued, “Furthermore, this matter is somewhat odd. According to what I know, it’s impossible for humans to advance to the Mythical stage with their own strength, much less reach the Terror grade. That creature said that he’s human, but his strength is very terrifying at the Terror grade. Unless he’s not human, there must be some secret behind this matter.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as he looked at the Moon Palace door in silence.</p>
<p>He didn’t care if the person who had possessed Wei Ge was human, but there was something that Zhou Wen was very concerned about.</p>
<p>For Shen Yuchi to risk his life for Wei Ge, something didn’t seem right no matter how he thought about it.</p>
<p>“Do you think it’s possible that Shen Yuchi knew of the existence of the Bone Pottery jar from the beginning?” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? If he knew, why did he take the risk to come here?” Ice Maiden frowned.</p>
<p>“That’s right. It doesn’t make sense, but there’s something else that doesn’t make sense. Although I haven’t interacted much with Wei Ge, I do know him a little. He’s definitely not someone who would sacrifice himself for a place like the bureau, yet he actually took the initiative to take the risk. This doesn’t seem like his character.”</p>
<p>“Is it possible that he was forced to do so? After all, even if lots were really drawn, Shen Yuchi might have tampered with them. The person who eventually had to go was still likely to be him. He might as well have taken the initiative. If he succeeded, he could still obtain Shen Yuchi’s recognition in the future,” Ice Maiden said.</p>
<p>“No, Wei Ge knows that Shen Yuchi is afraid of me. If he really needs to risk his life, he will probably seek help from me. It’s impossible for him to stop me from interfering with his actions.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen paused for a moment before continuing, “Is it possible that Wei Ge also recognizes the Bone Pottery and knows what’s inside, so he took the initiative to take the risk?”</p>
<p>“It seems illogical,” Ice Maiden said with a frown.</p>
<p>“But adding the two unreasonable things together seems to make sense. Otherwise, I really can’t figure out why Wei Ge and Shen Yuchi would do something so illogical,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“It’s not difficult to find out the answer. Just go in and take a look,” Ice Maiden said as she looked at the door of Moon Palace.</p>
<p>“Then let’s go in and take a look.” Zhou Wen glanced at his phone and realized that it was still downloading. He got Ice Maiden to lead the way as the two of them entered through the Moon Palace door.</p>
<p>He didn’t have a feel of it outside the door, but the moment he entered, Zhou Wen felt a terrifying coldness pass through the space suit that could withstand low temperatures. It made him shiver.</p>
<p>When Ice Maiden walked over, Zhou Wen immediately felt the coldness dissipate significantly as his body warmed up.</p>
<p>How did Shen Yuchi and the rest survive such a low temperature? Zhou Wen felt increasingly puzzled. Even his body couldn’t withstand it. He didn’t believe that Shen Yuchi and Wang Qiuyuan could withstand such low temperatures.</p>
<p>Thankfully, with Ice Maiden as an ice-elemental expert beside him, the coldness naturally receded wherever she went. Zhou Wen could vaguely see that there were many jade buildings in the cold fog, like a fairyland in myths.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1061'>Chapter 1061: Toad Palace</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Deep in Moon Palace, a terrifying explosion sounded. Zhou Wen saw a faint red flame flash in the distant fog. It was as though a building had caught fire. Mixed into the fog were flames and smoke, and the red glow in the white fog looked unnatural.</p>
<p>Is Wei Ge fighting? Zhou Wen felt as though the whole of Moon Palace was trembling.</p>
<p>The cold fog didn’t feel as cold as before. Ice Maiden scouted ahead as Zhou Wen followed behind her, heading deeper into Moon Palace.</p>
<p>In such a land of extreme coldness, it was Ice Maiden’s home ground. She controlled the frost aura, preventing it from injuring Zhou Wen at all.</p>
<p>As they walked, snowflakes floated out of the fog. Under the red glow of the flames, they looked like burning ashes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held one and took a careful look, but he was surprised to discover that it wasn’t ash or a snowflake. It was the petal of an osmanthus.</p>
<p>Could these petals be the ones Shen Yuchi wanted me to see? Zhou Wen summoned an ordinary Musical Note Sprite and placed the petal on it.</p>
<p>In the next second, he saw the petal transform into a strange light that fused into the Musical Note Sprite. The Musical Note Sprite immediately began to evolve.</p>
<p>It’s true! Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he hurriedly reached out to gather the petals that floated over.</p>
<p>These petals had magical effects on Companion Beasts, but Zhou Wen didn’t feel anything when he touched them. Clearly, they were ineffective on humans.</p>
<p>He gave a few petals to different Companion Beasts and realized that those at the Legendary stage could immediately evolve. However, those at the Epic stage only gained a slight boost in stats without any immediate evolution.</p>
<p>Just as Shen Yuchi had said, the petals of the osmanthus could only be used once. If they came into contact with the petals again, they wouldn’t be able to absorb much.</p>
<p>Even so, it was already very impressive. Zhou Wen wanted to collect more.</p>
<p>I wonder where these petals came from. I hope there are more. If I can get hundreds or even thousands of them, they will be of great use in the future. As Zhou Wen walked forward, he carefully gathered the petals.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because Wei Ge had already cleared all the dimensional creatures in Moon Palace that Zhou Wen and Ice Maiden didn’t see any dimensional creatures wherever they went.</p>
<p>There were jade towers one after another, but there was nothing inside. It was cold and empty.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for the crazy battle in the distance, Zhou Wen would have imagined that this was an empty palace complex.</p>
<p>He approached the flaming glow in front of him, and the cold fog dissipated. His vision also became much better.</p>
<p>One petal after another… There are already more than forty… Zhou Wen was delighted. In the future, when he obtained Mythical Companion Beasts that needed to be fed, one petal could advance them to the Epic stage. There would be no need to go to much trouble.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the flames erupted. They illuminated almost all of Moon Palace.</p>
<p>At that instant, Zhou Wen saw many things clearly. The most eye-catching was the huge osmanthus tree. It was thousands of feet tall and stood at the brightest spot in the distance.</p>
<p>Amidst the flames of war and the cold fog, the osmanthus tree was swaying. Large petals fluttered in the cold fog and flames like snowflakes or ashes. There were thousands of them—virtually uncountable.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was stunned. He almost couldn’t believe his eyes.</p>
<p>With so many osmanthus petals, even if he could only collect half of them, there would probably be tens of thousands, not to mention if he collected them all.</p>
<p>With so many petals, can I advance all the Musical Note Sprites to the Epic stage? I now have nearly a hundred thousand Musical Note Sprites. If I advance all of them to the Epic stage, the Epic Musical Note Sprite legion, together with the unified command of the Golden Harp, will produce combat strength that’s probably stronger than ordinary Mythical creatures. Zhou Wen wished he could immediately rush over and take the petals for himself.</p>
<p>However, reason told him that there was no such thing as a free lunch in this world, nor were there any flower petals that he could pick up for free. He might not be able to return alive if he rushed over now.</p>
<p>Ensuing under the huge osmanthus tree was the most intense battle. There was no sign of anyone.</p>
<p>Terrifying cold air and flames shot out from there.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s eyesight, he couldn’t see the battle. All he could see were dazzling lights. Without a doubt, it was a true Terror-grade battle.</p>
<p>Where did Shen Yuchi and Wang Qiuyuan go? Zhou Wen had been searching for their traces, but he couldn’t find any traces of them despite looking for so long.</p>
<p>They definitely didn’t go to save Wei Ge, but I didn’t encounter them along the way. They shouldn’t have turned back. Could it be that they really went to the huge osmanthus tree? However, considering the aftershocks from such a battle, I reckon ordinary Mythical creatures wouldn’t be able to withstand it. Would they really dare go there? Zhou Wen looked around and used the occasional erupting flames to size up his surroundings.</p>
<p>After watching for a while, Zhou Wen suddenly realized that Shen Yuchi and company’s target was likely not the osmanthus tree.</p>
<p>This is Toad Palace. Although the osmanthus tree is magical, the most precious treasure of Toad Palace isn’t the osmanthus tree. Zhou Wen observed the deeper parts of Frost Palace from afar.</p>
<p>The buildings there were different from the jade buildings here. They were made of osmanthus wood, forming pavilions and palaces.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly recalled something. Although Moon Palace and Chang’e were very famous, Moon Palace’s owner wasn’t Chang’e in truth. Moon Palace was only where Chang’e lived, not the Moon Goddess Temple. Moon Palace’s true owner was actually the Lady Supreme Yin, or rather, the Moon Goddess.</p>
<p>Supreme Yin and Supreme Yang had a lofty status in the East District’s mythology. Lady Supreme Yin’s status was nothing Chang’e, who had ascended simply from consuming an elixir, could compare with.</p>
<p>Could it be that Shen Yuchi and company’s target is there? The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that it was possible. The area where the osmanthus tree stood was only a small area of Toad Palace. Shen Yuchi and company could completely circle around that area and enter the depths of Toad Palace.</p>
<p>“Let’s take a look over there.” Zhou Wen temporarily gave up on the idea of picking up the petals and got Ice Maiden to lead him around the battle and head deeper into the wooden buildings.</p>
<p>Compared to the gorgeous jade buildings, the wooden buildings looked ordinary, but as long as one realized that the wood came from the osmanthus divine tree, they would immediately feel that the wooden buildings weren’t that ordinary.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi and company are indeed here. From afar, Zhou Wen saw Shen Yuchi and Wang Qiuyuan kneeling in front of a wooden hut. He didn’t know what they were doing.</p>
<p>2</p>
<h3 id='chapter1062'>Chapter 1062: Moon Goddess Temple</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Due to the distance, Zhou Wen couldn’t see the situation clearly. With a thought, he put on the Invisibility Cloak and approached Shen Yuchi and company.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden silently followed behind Zhou Wen. With her skills, even if she didn’t turn into her Terror form, Shen Yuchi and Wang Qiuyuan wouldn’t be able to discover her.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen got closer, he saw that the wooden hut they were kneeling in front of looked more like a temple. However, the temple didn’t have a plaque or a sign. Even the temple walls were made of osmanthus wood, but despite having been made into a wooden hut, there were still buds growing on it with beautiful osmanthus flowers blooming.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in this area, there was no longer the Moon Palace’s coldness. Instead, it made one feel refreshed and comfortable. It was indescribably pleasant.</p>
<p>The door to the wooden hut was closed. There were no dimensional creatures around Shen Yuchi and Wang Qiuyuan, but they were kneeling in front of the wooden hut’s door, their heads on the ground, motionless.</p>
<p>Could it be that there’s an invisible force suppressing them, forcing them to kneel? Zhou Wen looked left and right, but he couldn’t see any energy fluctuations. He looked at Ice Maiden beside him.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden clearly knew what was on Zhou Wen’s mind. She said in a voice that only Zhou Wen could hear, “They aren’t suppressed by any power.”</p>
<p>That’s strange. There aren’t any dimensional creatures or powers suppressing them. Why are they kneeling here? Or should I say, what’s the point of kneeling here? If this is really the Moon Goddess’s temple, could it be that they are kneeling here to ask for benefits from her? But how do they know that the Moon Goddess will give them something good by kneeling? Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>As the story of Chang’e’s ascension to the moon was so famous, people didn’t know much about the true Moon Goddess. Zhou Wen had only heard of the legend of Lady Supreme Yin, but he wasn’t too sure what kind of goddess she was.</p>
<p>Since Shen Yuchi and company were kneeling here, they definitely knew something. Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled. How did they know? The conclusion obtained solely from the analysis of myths wasn’t necessarily correct. People like Shen Yuchi definitely wouldn’t risk their lives for such a guess.</p>
<p>“Director-General, is this really useful?” Wang Qiuyuan knelt there, not daring to move, but he couldn’t help but speak.</p>
<p>“It’s useful. Just kneel down and don’t move. Stop talking,” Shen Yuchi answered.</p>
<p>They then fell into silence again. They knelt there without moving or saying a word. This left Zhou Wen somewhat depressed. He originally imagined that he might hear some secrets, but to his surprise, they stopped talking.</p>
<p>“If you want to know something, why don’t you ask them now?” Ice Maiden said.</p>
<p>“Ask them… That’s right… Why didn’t I think of it… You’re smart…” Zhou Wen suddenly understood what Ice Maiden meant.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi and the rest were kneeling in front of the wooden hut. They definitely had their orders, and wouldn’t dare to stand up. If he were to ask them, they probably wouldn’t dare remain silent.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen put away the Invisibility Cloak and walked towards Shen Yuchi and Wang Qiuyun who were kneeling in front of the door.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi and Wang Qiuyuan were alarmed when they heard the footsteps. Even if they didn’t dare look up, they quickly recognized that it was Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you came at the right time. We are trapped here and can’t move. Quickly save us,” Wang Qiuyuan pleaded.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen hadn’t heard their conversation, he would have been frightened and wouldn’t have dared to go over.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll save you now.” Zhou Wen curled his lips and walked to Wang Qiuyuan’s side, reaching out to pull him.</p>
<p>“Don’t… Don’t touch me…” Wang Qiuyuan’s body trembled as he hurriedly shouted.</p>
<p>“Director-General Shen, what’s going on? At the very least, you should make up a story to deal with me, right?” Zhou Wen squatted down and pressed his fingers on Shen Yuchi’s arm as he said calmly.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi lay there, not daring to move. Wang Qiuyuan said, “We originally wanted to save Little Wei, but we couldn’t see the path clearly in the cold fog. We accidentally came across this place and were cursed. If we move, we will explode…”</p>
<p>“This fabrication sucks. Director-General Shen, why don’t you make one up yourself?” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi finally said, “Before we came to the Moon, we perused a large amount of information and gained a lot of understanding of the Moon according to myths and legends. However, the information was only inferred from myths and legends. We didn’t know if it was real or fake, so we didn’t announce it.”</p>
<p>“That’s an interesting fabrication. Continue.” Zhou Wen pressed his fingers on Shen Yuchi’s arm as though he would push them at any moment.</p>
<p>“Moon Palace is actually equivalent to a cold palace, a place where royalty are put under house arrest. Therefore, Chang’e isn’t the Moon’s master. She’s just a prisoner. In myths and legends, the Moon’s true master is Lady Supreme Yin—Lady of the Moon—who is also the Moon Goddess. The place we are now is the true residence of the Moon Goddess, which is the Moon Goddess Temple.”</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi paused for a moment before continuing, “We believe that the nature of the Moon Goddess Temple is similar to Earth Temples. There might be benefits if we worship here.”</p>
<p>“This story is quite sound, but don’t tell me that you didn’t know of the existence of the Bone Pottery jar and the dead man before coming to the Moon,” Zhou Wen said coldly.</p>
<p>“In fact, the Bone Pottery jar and the dead man were discovered long ago. When I was on Earth, I had already done a lot of research and consulted many experts. That’s why I knew that the Bone Pottery jar is actually a kind of sacrificial artifact,” Shen Yuchi said.</p>
<p>“You knew that the person who picked up the Bone Pottery jar would be possessed, right?” Zhou Wen stared at Shen Yuchi and said.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t sure about that. I only knew that the Bone Pottery jar was used to offer sacrifices to deities. In ancient times, shamans used the Bone Pottery jar to communicate or invite deities to possess them. However, they usually used water or alcohol. I’ve never heard of such a flaming Bone Pottery jar. I don’t know what uses it has.” Shen Yuchi was clearly unwilling to admit that he had long known the consequences of touching the Bone Pottery jar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t expose him as he continued asking, “Did you originally want me to touch the Bone Pottery jar?”</p>
<p>“Why would I have such thoughts? I definitely didn’t have such intentions,” Shen Yuchi said.</p>
<p>“Did Wei Ge know about the Bone Pottery jar?” Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else as he asked Shen Yuchi another question.</p>
<p>“The matter regarding the Bone Pottery jar is a top secret in our bureau. Little Wei’s clearance isn’t high enough to come into contact with those secrets,” Wang Qiuyuan added.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had roughly guessed it as well. He and Wei Ge were actually sacrificial goods brought by Shen Yuchi. Shen Yuchi had originally wanted to lure Zhou Wen to touch the Bone Pottery jar.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi originally felt that a youth like Zhou Wen, who was proud and had powerful strength, would probably want to study the unknown when encountering one.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, Zhou Wen was like an old man who was afraid of death. Despite possessing such strength, he was still extremely cautious. Furthermore, he didn’t seem curious at all. He didn’t touch the Bone Pottery jar. This had left Shen Yuchi feeling very disappointed.</p>
<p>2</p>
<h3 id='chapter1063'>Chapter 1063: Lady Supreme Yin</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>How could Shen Yuchi know that Zhou Wen had suffered death too many times in-game? Therefore, he was especially careful in reality. He definitely wouldn’t touch anything unknown.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if what Shen Yuchi had said was true. Just as he was about to ask something else, he suddenly heard a creak as the door to the Moon Goddess Temple opened.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi and Wang Qiuyuan were immediately overjoyed. However, they didn’t dare look up and continued kneeling on the ground. Zhou Wen and Ice Maiden looked up without any qualms.</p>
<p>Inside the Moon Goddess Temple, there was a wooden statue. It was a dignified and beautiful woman.</p>
<p>When Ice Maiden saw the wooden statue, her expression immediately turned solemn. She was even somewhat alarmed as she involuntarily retreated.</p>
<p>However, with every step she took, frost footprints appeared on the ground. After taking a few steps back, she was frozen as though she had turned into a jade statue. Although there wasn’t any frost on her body, she gave off a feeling that she was frozen. It was extremely strange.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed. Ice Maiden was an ice-elemental Terror creature. The creature in the temple had to be unimaginably powerful to freeze her.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi and Wang Qiuyuan were overjoyed. They had been waiting for this moment.</p>
<p>Now that the Moon Goddess had appeared, the disrespectful Zhou Wen and Ice Maiden would naturally be punished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood there motionless. Even an existence like Ice Maiden had been frozen. If he moved, he might freeze even faster than her.</p>
<p>Instead, he stood still and temporarily didn’t feel anything strange.</p>
<p>However, when he looked at the wooden sculpture, Zhou Wen lamented inwardly. He couldn’t retreat or advance.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden was right. It’s best not to enter such a place, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>However, Ice Maiden was too careless. Ever since she had come to this world, the strongest she had seen was at the Terror grade. Furthermore, Zhou Wen had the Terror-grade Demonic Neonate, Grim Demon, and the Seven Seas Dragon King by his side. Therefore, although she found this place somewhat strange, she didn’t take it to heart. She felt that even if something went wrong, they should be able to resolve it. That’s why she still entered with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Since fate has brought you here, choose one among yourselves. I will help you walk the world and do good deeds to prevent calamity.” The Moon Goddess statue’s lips didn’t move, but an ethereal voice sounded.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found the line familiar. Although delivery was different, he seemed to have experienced a similar scene.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me it’s the one-in-three choice of Mythical Companion Beasts? As Zhou Wen thought to himself, he saw a pearl and a jade slip fly out from the Moon Goddess statue and land on the wooden table in front of the statue.</p>
<p>Why are there only two? Aren’t there usually three choices? Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he immediately thought of something. So that’s how it is. Someone has been here long ago and obtained a Mythical Companion Beast from here. Shen Yuchi must have known about this long ago, so he personally came to try his luck.</p>
<p>However, this Moon Goddess doesn’t seem to be very picky. She actually gives Companion Beasts to anyone. Now, there are three of us, but there are only two Companion Beasts. The two of them have been kneeling here the entire time. They are very respectful of the Moon Goddess. It’s very likely that the Moon Goddess will let them choose first. After they choose, what has it got to do with me? Zhou Wen’s mind raced, but he couldn’t think of a good solution.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen would be thankful if the Moon Goddess didn’t find fault with him or freeze him. He didn’t dare dream of choosing a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen had many Mythical Companion Beasts now. There was no need to take the risk.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi and Wang Qiuyuan clearly thought the same. The two of them were overjoyed.</p>
<p>Wang Qiuyuan looked at Shen Yuchi and saw him nod slightly. Only then did he bow to the Moon Goddess statue. “Thank you, Your Excellency for your reward. I want that pearl.”</p>
<p>After he bowed, there was no reaction from the temple. The Moon Goddess didn’t speak again. The pearl became even brighter, but it didn’t fly out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found it odd. He had previously chosen Companion Eggs. After a choice was made, the Companion Beasts would typically fly over themselves.</p>
<p>Wang Qiuyuan didn’t know what to do. He didn’t dare enter the Moon Goddess Temple, so he could only look at Shen Yuchi.</p>
<p>“Don’t go in yet. Let me give it a try.” Shen Yuchi was also somewhat puzzled. It was indeed as Zhou Wen had imagined. He knew that someone had come here and knew the details, so he had personally come to try his luck.</p>
<p>However, the development was different from what he knew. When the person who had taken away the first Companion Beast made the choice, the Companion Beast had flown over by itself, but for some reason, there was no movement.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, I choose the jade slip. Thank you for your reward,” Shen Yuchi said as he knelt.</p>
<p>Just as Shen Yuchi said that, the bamboo slip lit up. However, it only lit up, without any intention of moving.</p>
<p>“Director-General, I think we need to go in and retrieve them ourselves. Why don’t I go in and take a look first?” Wang Qiuyuan said as he looked at the luminous pearl and jade slip.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi nodded slightly. Wang Qiuyuan bowed again and said, “Your Excellency, I’ll be entering to retrieve the pearl.” Then, he got up and walked towards the Moon Goddess Temple.</p>
<p>Wang Qiuyuan was extremely excited. Although there were many more Mythical Companion Beasts available these days, they were still rare. Only a few experts had a chance of obtaining one. With his status, he had no chance of obtaining a Mythical Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Now, this was definitely a chance for him to achieve success in a single step. If the other inspectors who had come with him hadn’t died, this opportunity might not have landed on him.</p>
<p>Wang Qiuyuan walked to the door of the Moon Goddess Temple. Just as he was about to step in, frost suddenly appeared beneath his feet. Then, his entire body was frozen in front of the door. Just like Ice Maiden, there was no frost on his body. His body seemed to have turned into cold jade.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Isn’t she giving a Companion Beast? Why doesn’t she let them take it? Is this the Moon Goddess’s scam? Zhou Wen was alarmed. This was the first time he had seen such a scamming dimensional creature.</p>
<p>In the past, most of the dimensional creatures had laid obvious traps. They clearly informed people of the danger and dared them to come over.</p>
<p>However, Moon Goddess didn’t do so. She first told them of the benefits, only to kill them when they went over. Zhou Wen felt that she shouldn’t be called Moon Goddess, but a Scamming Goddess.</p>
<p>That’s right. She’s Lady Supreme Yin to begin with… There’s a second interpretation to the name… Zhou Wen thought about it and realized that the divine title made sense.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi also wore a puzzled look. This was completely different from the information he had obtained, but his information couldn’t be wrong. Therefore, he didn’t know what had gone wrong.</p>
<p>“Did that person lie to me?” Shen Yuchi’s expression changed.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you choose?” At that moment, a voice sounded from the Moon Goddess Temple. Although she didn’t say who she was talking to, there were only three people. Shen Yuchi and Wang Qiuyuan had chosen, while Zhou Wen hadn’t made a choice. She was definitely talking about Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Can I still choose?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise. This was because these items were supposed to be unique. They would be gone after being chosen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1064'>Chapter 1064: You Can Have It All</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“If you don’t want to choose, you can request both.” The voice that came from the Moon Goddess Temple left Zhou Wen’s mouth agape in surprise. He failed to immediately recover from his shock.</p>
<p>He didn’t know that he could make such a choice. In the past, when he had chosen Truth Listener and Banana Fairy, he could only choose once. There would be no reaction if he tried again.</p>
<p>But this entity was different. She actually said that he could choose them both.</p>
<p>Conspiracy… It must be a conspiracy… This Lady Supreme Yin wants to scam me after scamming them? Zhou Wen didn’t believe that such a good thing would happen and felt that there was definitely a trap.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi also thought so, so he kept looking at Zhou Wen. If Zhou Wen were to choose to take both, he might end up worse than Wang Qiuyuan.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, I’m not doubting you. It’s just that I’ve heard from others that a person can only choose a Companion Beast once, right?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That’s right. A person can only choose once.” The Moon Goddess’s voice floated out again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen never expected the Moon Goddess to admit it so quickly. After some thought, he carefully asked again, “One person can only choose one Companion Beast?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” the Moon Goddess answered with certainty.</p>
<p>“Then why are you allowing me to take both?” Zhou Wen felt that the Moon Goddess’s trap was a little too obvious. No matter how stupid he was, he wouldn’t fall for it that easily, right?</p>
<p>Although Shen Yuchi knew that Zhou Wen was very careful, he couldn’t help but feel somewhat disappointed when he saw that Zhou Wen wasn’t tempted.</p>
<p>“Choosing and requesting are two separate matters.” The Moon Goddess’s voice sounded, leaving Zhou Wen and Shen Yuchi stunned as their emotions underwent a subtle change.</p>
<p>“You mean…” Zhou Wen looked at the pearl and jade slip in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Now that these two Companion Beasts have been chosen, there are naturally no rules. Anyone can take them away and hatch them.” The Moon Goddess’s words left Shen Yuchi somewhat dumbfounded.</p>
<p>It must be a conspiracy… There must be a conspiracy… Shen Yuchi reacted and stared at the pearl and jade slip in the temple as he thought repeatedly.</p>
<p>“That works too… However, Your Excellency, your divine might is too powerful. A mortal like me can’t enter your temple…” No matter how greedy Zhou Wen was, he didn’t dare enter to take them.</p>
<p>However, just as Zhou Wen said that, the pearl and jade slip flew out and quickly landed in his hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the pearl and jade slip in disbelief.</p>
<p>Could it be that my luck has really turned for the better? I actually encountered such a good thing. Or could it be that I’m handsome and confident, and Lady Supreme Yin thinks that I’m a promising talent? Zhou Wen looked at the pearl and jade slip in his hand and was momentarily at a loss.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Shen Yuchi gritted his teeth so hard that they almost shattered. He had been tricked. Furthermore, he had been tricked by a deity.</p>
<p>However, he still couldn’t figure out why the Moon Goddess would entrap him and Wang Qiuyuan and give Zhou Wen the Companion Beasts that originally belonged to him and Wang Qiuyuan.</p>
<p>This didn’t make sense. It didn’t make any sense at all.</p>
<p>According to the information he had obtained, the Moon Goddess was a goddess who saved the world from calamity. It didn’t matter if one came from a noble family or a lowly family. Therefore, she didn’t have any requirements for their physiques. As long as one sincerely knelt and prayed, they would be rewarded by her.</p>
<p>But from the looks of it, that wasn’t the case at all.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t even kneel. He even caused trouble in front of the Moon Goddess Temple. That was a great disrespect to the Moon Goddess.</p>
<p>Now, not only did the Moon Goddess not punish him, but she had also scammed them and given their Companion Beasts to Zhou Wen. This infuriated Shen Yuchi to the point of nearly exploding. He couldn’t understand why this was happening.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Shen Yuchi had experienced too many storms in his life. He had long reached the point where he didn’t show his emotions on his face. Even though he didn’t show it at all, he was so angry that he almost went crazy.</p>
<p>“Lady Moon Goddess, you are truly wise, mighty, beautiful, and magnanimous…” After Zhou Wen confirmed that the Companion Beasts in his hand weren’t fake, he thought about the praises his limited vocabulary could afford and used them all to praise the Moon Goddess.</p>
<p>He now felt that the Moon Goddess was the best deity in the world—a deity with such foresight should be the only true god in the world.</p>
<p>Those gods such as God, Jade Emperor, Buddha, and the like were nothing compared to the mighty Moon Goddess. They should have long been eliminated.</p>
<p>“That’s not what you were thinking. Didn’t you say that I should be called Scam Goddess?” The words that came from the Moon Goddess Temple instantly made Zhou Wen break out into a cold sweat.</p>
<p>“Nothing of that sort. You are the gentle, beautiful, and kind Goddess of the Moon. If anyone dares to be disrespectful to you, I’ll not let him off,” Zhou Wen hurriedly said, not daring to think too much.</p>
<p>Moon Goddess seemed to have the ability to read minds.</p>
<p>Beside him, Shen Yuchi’s face turned pale. If the Moon Goddess really had the ability to read minds, what he was thinking would probably lead him to an outcome worse than Wang Qiuyuan.</p>
<p>Just as he thought of this, his body quickly froze, turning into a jade statue like Wang Qiuyuan.</p>
<p>“Since you have already obtained the Companion Beasts, would you mind doing me a small favor?” The Moon Goddess didn’t harp on the matter.</p>
<p>“You also know that I’m weak. What can I do for you?” Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat as he thought to himself, As expected, there’s no free lunch in this world. I wonder what this Moon Goddess wants?</p>
<p>“It’s not a big deal. Go to Moon Palace and help Chang’e defeat the logger,” the Moon Goddess said.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, your divine powers are boundless. Isn’t it just a matter of moving your fingers to deal with the logger? With my lowly strength, I won’t be of much help even if I go. Instead, I might become a burden.” Zhou Wen wasn’t crazy. How could he be a match for the logger?</p>
<p>However, the Moon Goddess’s words confirmed that the one possessing Wei Ge was the logger.</p>
<p>“If I could leave this temple, would I need to seek your help?” The Moon Goddess said, “Her abilities are very compatible with the Moon Palace. If you take her to help in the battle, you might be able to defeat the logger.”</p>
<p>Moon Goddess was naturally referring to the frozen Ice Maiden.</p>
<p>“You also said that it’s a ‘might’…” Zhou Wen still didn’t want to go. Ignoring how terrifying the logger was, the body he possessed belonged to Wei Ge. They were former school classmates after all. Neither Wei Ge nor the logger had made attempts on his life. It wouldn’t be right for him to kill them, much less destroy Wei Ge’s body.</p>
<p>“Of course, you can also choose not to help. However, if the logger succeeds, the Moon will be destroyed. Do you think Earth will be unaffected?” the Moon Goddess said calmly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally knew that the Moon had a huge influence on Earth. If the Moon was really destroyed, Earth would definitely be greatly affected. It was even possible for an apocalyptic calamity to happen.</p>
<p>“Didn’t the logger say that he only wants to retrieve his Companion Beast? It shouldn’t be that exaggerated to the point of destroying the Moon, right?” Zhou Wen was skeptical.</p>
<p>“Do you know what Companion Beast he wants to take away?” the Moon Goddess asked calmly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1065'>Chapter 1065: Elixir of Immortality</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“I don’t know,” Zhou Wen said, but he thought to himself, It’s not like we’re friends. Who knows what his Companion Beast is?</p>
<p>“Have you heard of the story of Chang’e’s ascension to the Moon?” the Moon Goddess asked again.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of this before. Legend has it that Chang’e secretly ate the Elixir of Immortality that belonged to her husband, Hou Yi, who obtained it from the Queen Mother of the West. Then, she ascended to the Moon and became an immortal fairy…” Zhou Wen had naturally heard of this story. As it was so famous, it was difficult for him not to know it.</p>
<p>Moon Goddess continued, “Then do you know why Chang’e ascended to the Moon after secretly eating the Elixir of Immortality and not anywhere else?”</p>
<p>How would I know… Wait… Elixir of Immortality… Tree of Immortality… Could it be… Zhou Wen suddenly thought of a possibility.</p>
<p>“You aren’t that stupid. That’s right. The Elixir of Immortality is made from the materials from the Tree of Immortality. Chang’e secretly ate the Elixir of Immortality and was pulled to the Moon by the Tree of Immortality.”</p>
<p>Moon Goddess paused for a moment before continuing, “As for the Tree of Immortality, it’s the foundation of the Moon. The Companion Beast is also inside. If the logger fells the Tree of Immortality, the Moon will crumble as well. When that happens, not only will my temple be affected, but even Earth will be affected. You can decide if you want to go or not.”</p>
<p>“I do want to help, but I’m afraid that if I’m not strong enough, I won’t be able to provide any help. Instead, I’ll only be a burden.” Zhou Wen watched as the splendid showcase of ice and fire powers unfolded before him. He couldn’t even see a figure. It would be no different from courting death if he went.</p>
<p>“That dimensional Terror creature has the same attributes as the Moon Palace. Since you can control her, just let her help Chang’e. With her help, Chang’e should be able to last a little longer,” Moon Goddess said.</p>
<p>“Just a little longer?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled. If that was the case, it didn’t seem to be of much use.</p>
<p>“The logger is an existence that can chop down the Tree of Immortality. It’s not something an ordinary Terror-grade creature can compare with. Getting her to help Chang’e only serves as a delay. Use this time to retrieve something. With that item, you can defeat the logger and stop him from cutting down the Tree of Immortality and save the Moon from danger,” Moon Goddess explained.</p>
<p>“What is it? It can actually defeat the logger?” Zhou Wen’s heart stirred. If there was really such a treasure, it was worth a try.</p>
<p>“The Elixir of Immortality.” Moon Goddess’s answer alarmed Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Didn’t Chang’e secretly eat the Elixir of Immortality? Does it still exist? What effects does it have? How do I use it after I get it back?” Zhou Wen asked several questions in a row.</p>
<p>Although Chang’e’s actions were culpable, the Elixir of Immortality was just too magical. A mortal could actually ascend in broad daylight after consuming it. Although it was only a legend, no matter how weak the effects were, he should be able to advance to the Mythical stage after eating it, right?</p>
<p>“The medicinal effects of the Elixir of Immortality can allow a person to possess powerful and immense strength for a short period of time. If you take the Elixir of Immortality to Chang’e, she will naturally have the ability to defeat the logger. Of course, you can also eat it yourself and fight the logger yourself. That’s up to you,” Moon Goddess said.</p>
<p>“Is it just a temporary increase in combat strength?” Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed when he heard that.</p>
<p>“Not entirely. Although the medicinal essence can’t be maintained forever, the burst of improvement will also allow your body to obtain permanent benefits. With your body, this little benefit is enough to help you break through to the Mythical stage that is unreachable by humans,” Moon Goddess said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was overjoyed, but on second thought, if he could easily obtain something as good as the Elixir of Immortality, why didn’t she get Shen Yuchi and company to go? Why did she choose him?</p>
<p>“The Elixir of Immortality is precious. There must be a terrifying creature protecting it, right?” Zhou Wen asked carefully, afraid that he would infuriate the Moon Goddess.</p>
<p>“Of course there’s protection, but you don’t have to worry about that. If you take my token over, it will naturally view you in a different light and won’t make things too difficult for you.” Moon Goddess paused before saying, “Now that the Moon is in danger, this is your last chance. If I wasn’t confident, I wouldn’t be sending you.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that it made sense. Once the Moon was destroyed, this Moon Goddess probably couldn’t even protect her temple. She definitely wouldn’t do anything rash.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll make a trip. Where can I get the Elixir of Immortality?” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that this matter was beneficial to him.</p>
<p>If he could obtain the Elixir of Immortality, he could use it to advance to the Mythical stage without wasting any time advancing Glimmer.</p>
<p>This was because even if the Glimmer Life Soul advanced to a Perfect Body, it was unknown if it could push him to the Mythical stage. After all, everything was just his speculation.</p>
<p>The Elixir of Immortality was much more reliable. With Chang’e being a precedent, he could obtain some benefits no matter what.</p>
<p>If there was really danger, he could use the Glimmer Life Soul to directly teleport back to Earth. There wouldn’t be too much of a risk. He could also test if that made Glimmer advance to a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>“Walk west from here. After passing through the osmanthus forest, you will see a medicine mortar. The Elixir of Immortality is inside…” said Moon Goddess.</p>
<p>After telling Zhou Wen the detailed steps, Moon Goddess dispelled the ice from Ice Maiden’s body and allowed her to regain her freedom.</p>
<p>When Ice Maiden came to life, she looked into the Moon Goddess Temple in horror. Clearly, she was somewhat afraid.</p>
<p>“Ice Maiden, help Chang’e fight the logger. Try your best to stall for time. I’ll come back to help you after retrieving the Elixir of Immortality.” Zhou Wen explained the general situation to her and got her to help Chang’e while he headed west to retrieve the Elixir of Immortality as instructed by Moon Goddess.</p>
<p>The osmanthus forest was beautiful, but the Moon Goddess told him that these osmanthus trees were not Trees of Immortality. There were a total of two Trees of Immortality on the Moon, one growing on the surface of the Moon—the one at the entrance to Toad Palace.</p>
<p>However, that Tree of Immortality had already been felled, leaving only a stump.</p>
<p>There was also the huge osmanthus tree in Toad Palace. It was the foundation of Toad Palace. Once it was destroyed, the Moon would collapse. It couldn’t be lost.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out to pluck some petals and tested them with his Companion Beasts. Indeed, these petals didn’t have the effect of evolving Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Just as the Moon Goddess had said, there were no other dimensional creatures in Toad Palace. He didn’t encounter any danger along the way and passed through the osmanthus forest smoothly.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen rode the Great Might Vajra Bull through the osmanthus forest, his download was finally completed. A moon icon appeared on the phone’s homescreen.</p>
<p>However, the name of the dungeon wasn’t Moon Palace, but the name ‘Toad Palace.’</p>
<p>Moon Palace sounds better. Toad Palace keeps reminding me of that toad. A place like the moon should have some beautiful legends. When I return with the Elixir of Immortality, I’ll go and see how beautiful Chang’e is. Zhou Wen was very curious about the beauty of this fairy who was known for her beauty.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1066'>Chapter 1066: Jade Rabbit</h3>

<p>Before leaving, Zhou Wen had asked Moon Goddess what the medicine mortar looked like, but she told him that he would identify it at a glance after leaving the osmanthus forest. It would be easy to recognize it.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen knew why he could recognize it at a glance. The white object was clearly a huge ring-shaped mountain. Moon Goddess had actually called it a medicine mortar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that he wasn’t mistaken because the surrounding ring-shaped mountains were all gray. Only this one was white and looked especially striking.</p>
<p>According to what Zhou Wen knew, many of the ring-shaped mountains on the moon were formed from meteorites, but this white ring-shaped mountain looked somewhat special.</p>
<p>As the mountain wall of the ring-shaped mountain wasn’t very tall—only about two to three hundred meters—the Great Might Vajra Bull leaped up and arrived at the edge of the ring-shaped mountain, allowing him to look inside.</p>
<p>The mountain wall inside the ring-shaped mountain was much higher. It was probably about a thousand meters tall. The interior space was much bigger than what he saw from the outside.</p>
<p>If this thing is a medicine mortar, how big would the pestle have to be to match it? How big would the pill made from it be? Can humans eat it? As Zhou Wen thought, he sized up the interior of the ring-shaped mountain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t find any pills or anything like that. He didn’t even see a pill-shaped stone. The interior of the ring-shaped mountain was clean as though it had been washed with water.</p>
<p>In a corner of the mountain, there was a huge white rabbit lying on the ground. The rabbit was surprisingly huge. If it stood up, it would probably be about the same height as Zhou Wen. Its white fur was like snow and extremely fluffy.</p>
<p>If it were placed in a plush toy shop, one would think that it was a large furry doll.</p>
<p>Is this the legendary Jade Rabbit that grinds the medicine? Zhou Wen had already learned from Moon Goddess that the one guarding the Elixir of Immortality was Jade Rabbit.</p>
<p>Seeing the Jade Rabbit sleeping, Zhou Wen felt that it was best not to alarm it. It was best if he could take the Elixir of Immortality while it slept.</p>
<p>Although Moon Goddess said that Jade Rabbit wouldn’t make things difficult for him if he had her token, Zhou Wen still felt that it was better to avoid trouble.</p>
<p>He put on the Invisibility Cloak and entered the ring-shaped mountain. Furthermore, he used Truth Listener to constantly scan the vicinity of the Jade Rabbit, hoping to find the legendary Elixir of Immortality.</p>
<p>Strange, why isn’t there any? Could it be that the Elixir of Immortality has been eaten by the Jade Rabbit? Zhou Wen felt that the possibility was very high.</p>
<p>After all, how could Jade Rabbit not eat such a good item after guarding it all day, every day?</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was hesitating about waking up the Jade Rabbit, it suddenly pricked up its ears. Its ears twitched a few times before it looked up at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly removed the Invisibility Cloak and revealed himself. At the same time, he took out the pearl and jade slip he had previously obtained. He waved them in front of the Jade Rabbit and said, “I’m here on Moon Goddess’s orders. She wants to borrow your Elixir of Immortality…”</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could finish his sentence, he felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>The originally docile Jade Rabbit’s eyes immediately turned red when it saw the pearl and jade slip in Zhou Wen’s hand. Its fur stood on end like an enraged bull.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, is this what Moon Goddess means by it won’t make things difficult for me on her account? Zhou Wen felt that he had definitely been scammed by Moon Goddess.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was in thought, the Jade Rabbit stood up on its hind legs and grabbed a jade pole from somewhere.</p>
<p>In the next second, Jade Rabbit leaped up and flew into the air like a rocket.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still puzzled as to why the fellow was jumping so high. However, he was immediately alarmed to discover that the Jade Rabbit’s body was constantly expanding in midair as it turned gigantic. Even the jade pestle in its arms was extremely huge.</p>
<p>Then, Zhou Wen saw the gigantic jade pestle strike at the ring-shaped mountain with the might of a mountain.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t! Zhou Wen saw how terrifying the might was. He was probably no match for it as he hurriedly summoned Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth gigantified as it raised its claws to meet the jade pestle.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth’s body trembled violently as its back bent involuntarily. The rocks beneath its feet shattered.</p>
<p>Pfft!</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth, who was in its Absolute Strength state, spat out blood.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit struck down one pestle after another as though it was grinding medicine. In its Absolute Strength state, Tyrant Behemoth was unable to move. All it could do was passively take a beating.</p>
<p>It was only thanks to Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength that it wasn’t reduced to meat paste by Jade Rabbit—any other Companion Beast wouldn’t have survived.</p>
<p>What terrifying strength. Could this Jade Rabbit also be at the Terror grade as well? Zhou Wen saw Tyrant Behemoth spew out blood under the continuous bombardment. Seeing that it was about to collapse, Zhou Wen immediately knew that Jade Rabbit wasn’t an ordinary Mythical creature.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, he summoned the Seven Seas Dragon King that had been parasitized by Primordial Spore. Although this wasn’t the sea and the Seven Seas Dragon King couldn’t use its greatest strength, a Terror grade was still worth something. Once it used its Terror form, it would be much stronger than ordinary Mythical Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>The moment the Seven Seas Dragon King appeared, it immediately transformed into its Terror form under Zhou Wen’s orders. Then, it spewed out a large amount of glue-like liquid. Jade Rabbit’s jade pestle struck down and smashed into the glue, immediately sticking to it.</p>
<p>The Jade Rabbit tried its best to pull out the jade pestle, but the glue spewing out from the Seven Seas Dragon King’s dragon head kept increasing. The stickiness also increased, preventing Jade Rabbit from pulling it out no matter how hard it tried.</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit hissed angrily as it exerted all its strength. However, after pulling out a portion of the jade pestle, the sticky liquid clung to it like countless white threads.</p>
<p>The Seven Seas Dragon King continued spewing out glue as the adhesiveness increased.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was overjoyed. He knew that he was lucky. The Seven Seas Dragon King’s ability seemed to counter the Jade Rabbit.</p>
<p>Unable to pull out the jade pestle, Jade Rabbit immediately became anxious. It abandoned the jade pestle and struck out its front claws towards the ring-shaped mountain, hoping to tear the Seven Seas Dragon King apart.</p>
<p>The Seven Seas Dragon King wasn’t to be outdone. It spewed out large amounts of glue to meet Jade Rabbit’s claws.</p>
<p>When the Jade Rabbit’s claws touched the glue, they were immediately stuck together. When its claws reached into the ring-shaped mountain, they ended up stuck, preventing it from pulling them out.</p>
<p>The more it struggled, the more glue stuck to its body, making it unable to move.</p>
<p>The furious Jade Rabbit’s body lit up as it grew bigger and bigger. It became much bigger than Tyrant Behemoth. Soon, Tyrant Behemoth looked like a baby in front of it.</p>
<p>Even so, the Jade Rabbit still failed to escape the glue.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was overjoyed. The Jade Rabbit was clearly a pure Strength-type creature. Its Terror transformation was also purely a Strength-based transformation, so it was perfectly countered by the Seven Seas Dragon King’s ability.</p>
<p>“Jade Rabbit, lend me your Elixir of Immortality and I’ll let you go,” Zhou Wen said to Jade Rabbit as he stood on the Seven Seas Dragon King’s head.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1067'>Chapter 1067: Battling Jade Rabbit</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>It was unknown if Jade Rabbit could understand him, but it ignored Zhou Wen and continued struggling.</p>
<p>However, as its body was covered in glue-like liquid, its struggles were futile.</p>
<p>A pure Strength-type creature has such a weakness. Once they are restrained, there’s almost no chance of turning the tables. Tyrant Behemoth has the same weakness. Zhou Wen ordered the Seven Seas Dragon King to take the initiative to attack when he realized that Jade Rabbit was refusing to surrender.</p>
<p>The Seven Seas Dragon King’s tentacles swept towards Jade Rabbit, but unfortunately, Jade Rabbit was just too big after its Terror transformation. The Seven Seas Dragon King’s tentacles were unable to wrap around Jade Rabbit’s body. All it could do was bite at its flesh.</p>
<p>The Jade Rabbit’s flesh was terrifyingly tough. The tentacles with dragon heads nearly had their teeth chip when biting at it—they failed to bite through its flesh. All they did was tear off some rabbit fur.</p>
<p>What a powerful physique! Zhou Wen was secretly alarmed.</p>
<p>The Seven Seas Dragon King was at the Terror grade after all. Furthermore, its strength wasn’t considered weak among the Terror-grade creatures. Yet, it was actually unable to break through the Jade Rabbit’s defense. The strength of this fellow’s physique was unimaginable.</p>
<p>If it hadn’t been restrained by the Seven Seas Dragon King’s ability, it would have been a huge problem.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I have no choice but to let Demonic Neonate take action. Zhou Wen summoned Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>“Jade Rabbit, I won’t be holding back if you don’t hand over the Elixir of Immortality,” Zhou Wen shouted at Jade Rabbit again, but it continued struggling and ignored him.</p>
<p>“Neonate, let it see some blood,” Zhou Wen instructed Demonic Neonate with his mind.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate received the order and immediately unsheathed her Demonic Sword that flew towards Jade Rabbit.</p>
<p>The Demonic Sword was just too small. In front of the gigantic Jade Rabbit, it couldn’t even be considered a needle.</p>
<p>However, the Demonic Sword’s offensive strength was clearly much stronger than the Seven Seas Dragon King’s. It tore through the Jade Rabbit’s flesh and stabbed right in.</p>
<p>A drop of blood flowed out along the sword hilt. Zhou Wen was about to shout at Jade Rabbit again, but when his gaze landed on its face, he was stunned.</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit’s originally red eyes had turned black. Then, its eyelids drooped down as crystalline tears shimmered inside.</p>
<p>“Wa!” Jade Rabbit suddenly cried as large drops of tears streamed down.</p>
<p>As it cried, its huge body slowly shrank and returned to its original size. It cried in the glue and soon, it was wet.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was depressed. “Why are you crying like a child when you’re a Terror creature?”</p>
<p>“Jade Rabbit, hand over the Elixir of Immortality and I’ll immediately release you,” Zhou Wen said to Jade Rabbit.</p>
<p>It would have been better if he hadn’t said it. With him saying that, Jade Rabbit cried even more tragically. Its tears flowed down like a stream.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was just about to say something when he suddenly realized that something was amiss. The tears had drenched the Jade Rabbit’s fur, and the sticky liquid that stuck to its body had automatically fallen off, preventing it from sticking to it.</p>
<p>When Jade Rabbit realized that the glue on its body had been removed, it was immediately surprised and delighted. It jumped up and rushed to the edge of the ring-shaped mountain. With another flash, it was gone. Its speed was terrifying.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately depressed. He didn’t expect Jade Rabbit’s tears to be able to remove the Seven Seas Dragon King’s sticky liquid. Jade Rabbit was gone before he could obtain the Elixir of Immortality.</p>
<p>With Jade Rabbit’s speed, even a Mythical Companion Beast that was proficient in speed wouldn’t be able to catch up. Since Demonic Neonate didn’t chase after it, it was obvious that any attempts would be pointless.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the Moon is doomed. It’s not my fault. Zhou Wen saw that the jade pestle of the Jade Rabbit was still stuck there. It couldn’t take it away in time, so he walked over to put it away.</p>
<p>After the Seven Seas Dragon King dispelled the sticky liquid, Zhou Wen reached out to grab the jade pestle, hoping to pick it up, but after exerting some force, the jade pestle remained motionless.</p>
<p>It’s heavy! Zhou Wen held the jade pestle with both hands, hoping to pull it out.</p>
<p>However, the jade pestle remained motionless, surprising Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen got the Seven Seas Dragon King to extend its tentacles to sweep up the jade pestle, but even after using all its strength, the Seven Seas Dragon King failed to lift it.</p>
<p>It can’t be! The Seven Seas Dragon King is at the Terror grade, but it can’t even lift the jade pestle? How heavy is this jade pestle! Zhou Wen was alarmed as he had another idea. Perhaps it’s not just a matter of strength. The Seven Seas Dragon King can even move a building after all. Perhaps it’s possible that only the Jade Rabbit can lift this jade pestle.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate suddenly turned her head in a direction. Zhou Wen turned his head and saw Jade Rabbit retracting its head and hiding behind the mountain.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Why is it back? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and knew what was going on.</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit was definitely unwilling to part with the jade pestle, so it had come back for it.</p>
<p>“Jade Rabbit, if you want the jade pestle back, exchange it with the Elixir of Immortality,” Zhou Wen shouted at the spot where Jade Rabbit was hiding.</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit seemed to know that Zhou Wen couldn’t catch up to it, so it became a lot bolder. Although it didn’t dare come over, it extended its head and paw from behind the mountain wall. Then, it raised its paw and made a universally-known gesture at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, this rabbit actually knows that? Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit knew that Zhou Wen couldn’t lift its jade pestle, so it wasn’t afraid of Zhou Wen’s threat. Zhou Wen really had no choice. The jade pestle was terrifyingly heavy. He couldn’t lift it at all.</p>
<p>What should I do? Zhou Wen glanced in the direction of Moon Palace and saw that the flames were becoming more and more blinding. Clearly, the logger was at a huge advantage. He didn’t know how long Chang’e and Ice Maiden could last.</p>
<p>Is the Moon really going to be destroyed? Zhou Wen wondered how he could obtain the Elixir of Immortality from Jade Rabbit.</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit’s speed is too fast. If Demonic Neonate doesn’t chase after it, it means that she knows that she can’t catch up to it. Furthermore, Jade Rabbit’s strength and physical toughness are extremely terrifying. It’s virtually impossible to catch it. However, if I don’t stand any chance, why would the Moon Goddess send me? Does she want to use Jade Rabbit to kill me? But there’s no need for that. She can even freeze Ice Maiden with her strength. If she wants to attack me, she could have done it in front of the Moon Goddess Temple.</p>
<p>But if I have a chance of obtaining the Elixir of Immortality, where’s the chance? Jade Rabbit isn’t someone I can match… Jade Rabbit… I seem to remember having something like that in the past… Zhou Wen suddenly thought of something as he sank his consciousness into the Chaos Bead and rummaged around.</p>
<p>After a while, Zhou Wen found something.</p>
<p>It was a translucent jade box with mysterious cloud patterns on it. This jade box was something Zhou Wen had obtained from White Cloud Mountain’s Jade Rabbit’s Lunar Prayer Stone.</p>
<p>Back when The Thearch had guided him to obtain the jade box, he had only discovered some low-level dimensional crystals inside. Zhou Wen was quite disappointed because they weren’t of much use.</p>
<p>He had felt that the jade box might be a little special, so he had stored it away in passing. Now, he suddenly recalled that the Jade Rabbit’s Lunar Prayer Stone was said to be a manifestation of the Jade Rabbit when it descended to the mortal world. The jade box was supposed to have been hidden by the Jade Rabbit. He didn’t really know if it had anything to do with the Jade Rabbit.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1068'>Chapter 1068: Exchange for the Elixir of Immortality</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if the jade box had anything to do with the Jade Rabbit on the moon. After all, legends were only legends. Many legends were just far-fetched.</p>
<p>When he took out the jade box, he only felt that the material of the jade box was somewhat similar to the jade pestle.</p>
<p>He compared the jade box with the jade pestle and realized that the materials were very similar.</p>
<p>He casually opened the jade box and suddenly heard a whoosh. The jade pestle, that even the Seven Seas Dragon King couldn’t move, actually moved by itself and flew into the jade box.</p>
<p>The jade pestle shrank as it flew over before quickly landing in the jade box. The box fit it perfectly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the jade pestle lying silently in the jade box and was alarmed. The Seven Seas Dragon King couldn’t even lift the jade pestle, but it didn’t seem to add much weight to the jade box.</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit immediately became anxious when it saw the jade pestle taken away. It stood on the edge of the mountain and shouted and jumped at Zhou Wen as though it was threatening him to return the jade pestle or it would eat him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen closed the jade box and stored it in the Chaos Bead before saying to Jade Rabbit, “Exchange for it with the Elixir of Immortality.”</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit was even more furious when it heard that. Its body expanded once again and soon, it became an extremely huge rabbit. Its body was much taller than the ring-shaped mountain.</p>
<p>The ring-shaped mountain was like a toy model in front of Jade Rabbit, while Zhou Wen and company were ants inside the toy.</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit revealed its ferociousness, but because it had suffered under the Seven Seas Dragon King, it didn’t dare rush down. All it did was flare up outside.</p>
<p>“Since you don’t wish to exchange for it, I’m leaving.” Zhou Wen carried Demonic Neonate and ordered the Seven Seas Dragon King to head out of the ring-shaped mountain.</p>
<p>The Seven Seas Dragon King’s tentacles danced as it quickly rushed out of the ring-shaped mountain. Jade Rabbit was screaming fiercely, but it didn’t dare rush forward or stop Zhou Wen. It was in a panic.</p>
<p>Wah!</p>
<p>When Jade Rabbit saw that Zhou Wen was really leaving the ring-shaped mountain, it cried out again. Its body rapidly shrank back to its original size as it rolled on the ground and cried.</p>
<p>“Give me some of the Elixir of Immortality and I’ll return the jade pestle to you,” Zhou Wen said to the crying Jade Rabbit on the ground.</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit crawled up from the ground, its eyes still brimming with tears. Then, it gestured with its front paws as though it was outlining a square.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took out the jade box and asked Jade Rabbit, “You want this box?”</p>
<p>When Jade Rabbit saw the jade box, it nodded immediately and stopped crying.</p>
<p>“Alright, I can give you the jade box and jade pestle, but you have to give me the Elixir of Immortality.” Zhou Wen had no use for the jade box, so he might as well exchange it with Jade Rabbit.</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit seemed hesitant as it looked at Zhou Wen and the jade box in his hand. Finally, it nodded firmly.</p>
<p>“Where did you put the Elixir of Immortality?” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief when he saw Jade Rabbit nod.</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit waved its paw at Zhou Wen before running in a particular direction.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ordered the Seven Seas Dragon King to follow Jade Rabbit and left the white ring-shaped mountain. He traversed numerous ring-shaped mountains and soon arrived in front of a stone hut.</p>
<p>The stone hut was simple and crude, as though it was built by a barbarian. It didn’t look anything special. Furthermore, the stone door was covered in dust, making it look uninhabited.</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit bowed in front of the stone hut before pushing open the door. It stood inside the stone hut and waved its paw at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked to the door and saw that the decorations in the stone hut were very simple. They were all primitive stone tools with stone carvings.</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit went to one of the stone pots and opened the lid. Then, it carefully picked up the stone pot and tipped it twice.</p>
<p>A crystalline pill rolled out of the stone pot. It was the size of a baby’s fist and emitted a strong osmanthus fragrance. The fragrance could penetrate the protection of the space suit, allowing Zhou Wen to smell the fragrance.</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit grabbed the pill with one paw and pointed at the jade box in Zhou Wen’s hand with the other paw, clearly indicating that it wanted to exchange it with him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t hand over the jade box. He looked at the stone pot and said, “You still have Elixirs of Immortality in that stone pot, right? Didn’t you say that you wanted to exchange all the Elixirs of Immortality with me?”</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit immediately picked up the stone pot and looked at Zhou Wen warily. Then, it pointed at the pill in its paw and the jade box, indicating that it was a one-for-one exchange.</p>
<p>“No can do. You have to exchange all the Elixirs of Immortality with me.” Zhou Wen shook his head.</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit’s face showed a struggle. Finally, as though it had made up its mind, it extended its paws and gestured a two in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted. From the looks of it, there are more than two Elixirs of Immortality in the stone pot.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pointed at the stone pot and said, “I want all the Elixirs of Immortality.”</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit hugged the stone pot and shook its head like a rattle drum. Its body kept retreating as it looked at Zhou Wen as though it was looking at a thief.</p>
<p>“Don’t you want the jade box and jade pestle?” Zhou Wen waved the jade box in front of Jade Rabbit and tempted it.</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit’s eyes followed the jade box as it spun. It wished it could grab the jade box, but it couldn’t bear to part with the Elixirs of Immortality.</p>
<p>Seeing Jade Rabbit struggling as though it couldn’t make up her mind, Zhou Wen asked, “How many Elixirs of Immortality are in the stone pot?”</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit used its paw to gesture three. Only then did Zhou Wen realize that there were only three Elixirs of Immortality.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen noticed that Jade Rabbit’s intelligence wasn’t high. At most, it was at the level of a child. His heart stirred as he said to the Jade Rabbit with a smile, “How about this? I’ll exchange the jade box for all your Elixirs of Immortality.”</p>
<p>When Jade Rabbit heard that, it immediately shook its head and hugged the stone pot even tighter.</p>
<p>“Hear me out. Just treat it as leaving the Elixirs of Immortality with me. In the future, follow me and help me do some trivial things if possible. I’ll take care of your food and drink. If you perform well, I’ll return one Elixir of Immortality to you. If you perform well and make me happy, I’ll return two Elixirs of Immortality. Perhaps you can even get back all three Elixirs of Immortality. What do you think?” Zhou Wen said to Jade Rabbit.</p>
<p>When Jade Rabbit heard that, it extended its paw and counted as though it was calculating something.</p>
<p>After some calculation, Jade Rabbit felt that it was worth it. Therefore, it nodded happily and handed the stone pot to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“That’s right. I’ll help you put the Elixirs of Immortality away for now. From now on, follow me and you’ll live in the lap of luxury. I guarantee you won’t regret it.” Zhou Wen reached out to take the stone pot.</p>
<p>However, Jade Rabbit pulled it back and pointed at the jade box in Zhou Wen’s hand. It meant that they had to exchange the items at the same time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen handed the jade box over in exchange for the stone pot. He looked inside and indeed, there were three pills inside. Each of them were jade-white and emitted a strong osmanthus fragrance. Just taking in the fragrance made him feel refreshed as though he was about to fly and ascend.</p>
<p>When Jade Rabbit obtained the jade box, it was also very happy. It hugged the jade box and rubbed its face against it as though it had obtained a treasure.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1069'>Chapter 1069: Speculation of the Strongest Companion Beast</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>When Zhou Wen returned, he didn’t head to the Moon Goddess Temple. Instead, he circled around and came close to Moon Palace.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen didn’t know how true the Moon Goddess’s words were, he wanted to head to Moon Palace to take a look.</p>
<p>With the Elixirs of Immortality in hand, and having lured Jade Rabbit over, together with the Seven Seas Dragon King and Demonic Neonate, he could greatly influence the battle. It wouldn’t be too late to make a move after figuring out who would be beneficial to humanity.</p>
<p>At that moment, there was almost no cold fog in Moon Palace. There were flames burning everywhere, and many jade buildings were aflame.</p>
<p>Amidst the flames, there was only a jade palace with a small amount of cold fog surging.</p>
<p>As for the huge osmanthus tree, under the remnant blasts from the battle, large numbers of petals fell and fluttered everywhere.</p>
<p>I’m rich. There are so many petals, and every one of them is equivalent to an Epic Companion Beast… Zhou Wen saw that there were copious numbers of petals. He didn’t know how long it would take him to pick them up if he were to pick them up one by one. Therefore, he summoned the army of Musical Notes and let them fuse with the petals.</p>
<p>Companion Beasts below the Mythical stage found it difficult to maintain their combat strength in space. However, there were a few low-level Companion Beasts that could survive in space.</p>
<p>Although Musical Note Sprites had virtually zero combat strength in space, surviving wasn’t a problem.</p>
<p>Thousands of Musical Note Sprites pounced at the falling petals. Every Musical Note Sprite immediately absorbed the petals upon contact, allowing them to enter an evolutionary state.</p>
<p>The scene of tens of thousands of Companion Beasts evolving together was spectacular.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had almost 100,000 Musical Note Sprites and the number of petals that fell here exceeded 100,000.</p>
<p>He summoned the other Legendary and Epic Companion Beasts he usually gathered and got them to absorb the petals.</p>
<p>Those at the Legendary stage were directly promoted, but those at the Epic stage only had their stats boosted. When they used a second petal, the effects became much weaker.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the Evil Spirit King as well, hoping that he could absorb the petals and quickly advance. To his surprise, he didn’t even look at the petals. He had no intention of absorbing them.</p>
<p>Is he that picky? Zhou Wen was somewhat speechless.</p>
<p>Ever since the Evil Spirit King was born, it had only absorbed energy from Companion Eggs. Furthermore, they had to be at the same level—it ate nothing else.</p>
<p>There were still many petals falling from the tree, but they were all closer to the battlefield. Zhou Wen was afraid of being implicated, so he didn’t dare approach.</p>
<p>Just as he was hesitating about whether to pick up the petals, he suddenly heard a loud bang. The jade palace, that had emitted a cold fog, exploded and was instantly reduced to ruins.</p>
<p>All the cold fog vanished. At the same time, two figures appeared from the ice beam. Clearly, they were unable to maintain their Terror states.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw Ice Maiden land in a sorry state in the ruins of the palace. The huge dark-gold toad had fallen with her.</p>
<p>At that moment, the dark-gold toad’s body emitted layers of frosty gas. Its body seemed to be covered in frost, but some spots were already charred black by the flames. There was no protection from the frost.</p>
<p>It’s Ice Maiden and the toad. Why don’t I see Chang’e? Zhou Wen looked around but didn’t see the legendary Chang’e.</p>
<p>Just as he was feeling puzzled, he saw Wei Ge walk out of the flames one step at a time. He held nothing in his hand, but flames condensed into a battle axe that hung down to the ground.</p>
<p>“Chang’e, you can’t stop me. Give up,” Wei Ge said as he walked towards the dark-gold toad.</p>
<p>Who is he talking to? Who’s Chang’e? There’s only that toad over there… Zhou Wen widened his eyes in disbelief as he stared at the dark-gold toad.</p>
<p>He couldn’t believe his guess. The beautiful celestial maiden, Chang’e, was actually a toad. Wasn’t this too ridiculous?</p>
<p>However, the toad stirred up the frost again and stood in front of Wei Ge. It looked like it wanted to continue fighting, but it couldn’t even enter the Terror state. Its combat strength had greatly weakened. Even if it continued fighting, only death awaited it.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden was clearly seriously injured. She was also unable to maintain her Terror transformation, but she wasn’t as stubborn as the toad. She had already secretly retreated.</p>
<p>As Wei Ge walked towards the toad, he said, “Chang’e, why bother? Let me chop down the Tree of Immortality. Although you will lose the ability to live forever, you can regain your original appearance and no longer have to be an ugly toad. Isn’t this what you want? Or would you rather be an ugly toad in order to live forever?”</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen heard this, he was certain that the toad was the legendary Chang’e.</p>
<p>Chang’e is actually a toad. I wonder how those people who fantasize about Chang’e will react when they see her true appearance? Zhou Wen secretly rejoiced that he hadn’t immediately eaten the Elixir of Immortality after obtaining it.</p>
<p>So the Elixir of Immortality created using the Tree of Immortality actually had such negative side effects.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen would rather not advance to the Mythical stage than become a toad.</p>
<p>“Even if I’m ugly and despised by the world, I will still wait here for him.” The toad finally spoke. Indeed, it was a woman’s voice.</p>
<p>“He’s only an ordinary human. Even if he has the stunning Power of Sun Strafe, he’s only a speck of dust in the river of time. It’s already unknown where the dust has landed. That wait will be fruitless,” Wei Ge said.</p>
<p>“No, he’ll come, he’ll definitely…” Chang’e yelled in a frenzy.</p>
<p>“If you knew this would happen, why did you do it in the first place? I originally wanted to spare your life on account of our similar circumstances. Since you wish for death, I can only fulfill your wish,” Wei Ge said as he slowly raised the flaming ax in his hand, hoping to kill the toad.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hesitated for a moment before taking out an Elixir of Immortality. He summoned the Jade Rabbit and headed for Chang’e.</p>
<p>“Chang’e, let me ask you. If the Tree of Immortality is chopped down, will the Moon really be destroyed?” Zhou Wen asked the dark-gold toad.</p>
<p>“No.” Chang’e originally didn’t want to answer when she saw that it was a human youth, but when she saw Jade Rabbit beside Zhou Wen, she was slightly alarmed and answered his question.</p>
<p>Was Moon Goddess really lying to me? Zhou Wen frowned inwardly.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Chang’e continued, “However, the Tree of Immortality is connected to the Moon’s Companion Beast. The destruction of the Tree of Immortality means that when the Companion Beast inside the Moon appears, the Moon, which is the outer shell of the Companion Egg, will naturally shatter.</p>
<p>“What… You’re telling me that the Moon is a Companion Egg…” Zhou Wen looked at Chang’e in horror, almost unable to believe his ears.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>He wasn’t shocked by the strength of the Companion Beasts inside the Moon, but the news made him think of something else.</p>
<p>If the Moon is a Companion Egg, what about Earth? If Earth is also a Companion Egg, wouldn’t the strongest Companion Beast that the dimension is seeking be inside the Earth?</p>
<p>If the Companion Beast broke out of its shell, Zhou Wen couldn’t imagine what Earth would become.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1070'>Chapter 1070: The Cause of the Catastrophe</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that it was right. It was no wonder the bigwigs of the dimension said that Earth would be doomed once the strongest Companion Beast was found.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but recall a scene after a chick broke out of its shell. It seemed like some fledglings ate their eggshells.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden also seemed to have thought of something, and her expression became extremely strange.</p>
<p>That’s not right. If Earth is a Companion Egg, wouldn’t we be able to find the Companion Beast inside as long as we keep digging? There’s no need to spend so much time searching, right?</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen thought about it, he suddenly thought of something. Could it be that the ship that tore through the sky and broke apart the supercontinent was planning to crack the Companion Egg and search for the Companion Beast inside the Earth? If that’s the case, they clearly didn’t succeed. What stopped them?</p>
<p>Countless thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind, but he didn’t know which was the correct answer.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was still pondering, Wei Ge’s flaming ax slashed at the toad.</p>
<p>“Bunny, stop him,” Zhou Wen shouted at Jade Rabbit.</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit was somewhat hesitant, but when it saw Zhou Wen raise the Elixir of Immortality in his hand, it immediately took action. It took out the jade pestle and transformed into the huge rabbit in its Terror state. It smashed it at Wei Ge.</p>
<p>The flaming ax in Wei Ge’s hand rose and collided with the huge jade pestle that Jade Rabbit had smashed down.</p>
<p>With a boom, a terrifying shock wave instantly destroyed everything nearby.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was sent flying as the space suit turned to dust, revealing the Galaxy Shell Dragon Armor inside.</p>
<p>With Absolute Defense, Zhou Wen survived the terrifying blast.</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit’s strength was extremely terrifying. The jade pestle constantly struck out, showing zero disadvantage when facing Wei Ge head-on. It even had the upper hand.</p>
<p>This surprised Zhou Wen greatly. This was because Jade Rabbit had previously been restrained by the Seven Seas Dragon King, preventing it from unleashing its true strength. This had given Zhou Wen the illusion that it wasn’t very strong.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the strength of the Jade Rabbit far exceeded the dark-gold toad.</p>
<p>On second thoughts, Zhou Wen came to a realization. The logger could fell the Tree of Immortality, and Jade Rabbit could also use the Tree of Immortality as a medicinal ingredient.</p>
<p>It would be impossible for an existence that could shatter the Tree of Immortality to be weak.</p>
<p>As long as it wasn’t restrained, Jade Rabbit’s strength was just too terrifying.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wore the Shell Dragon Armor, so the radiation and environment on the moon couldn’t harm him. The boiling point on the moon was very low, so if ordinary people didn’t have space suits to protect them. Their blood would boil, making it impossible for them to survive.</p>
<p>With the protection of the Shell Dragon Armor, he didn’t have to worry about this. However, he hadn’t reached a state where he could survive without oxygen. Without oxygen for a long period of time, he would still die.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen’s Chaos Bead had many space suits and oxygen supplies, so he didn’t have to worry.</p>
<p>Now wasn’t the time to change into his space suit. Zhou Wen quickly retreated to prevent himself from being drawn into the terrifying battle.</p>
<p>Chang’e and Ice Maiden were also sent flying. They had been severely injured, so they were unable to transform into their Terror forms for the time being and could no longer participate in the battle.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t give the Elixir of Immortality to Chang’e. If Jade Rabbit could suppress the logger, he could save one Elixir of Immortality.</p>
<p>“Jade Rabbit can’t stop the logger. Give the Elixir of Immortality to Chang’e and get her to help Jade Rabbit.” Moon Goddess’s ethereal voice suddenly entered Zhou Wen’s ears.</p>
<p>“Moon Goddess, didn’t you say that with your token, Jade Rabbit wouldn’t do anything to me? I was nearly killed by Jade Rabbit,” Zhou Wen said coldly.</p>
<p>Moon Goddess’s voice remained as gentle as before. “If I hadn’t said that, would you have gone? I also knew that it would be extremely dangerous, but if you hadn’t made the trip, there’d really be no hope for the Moon.”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you really thought that I could defeat the Terror-grade Jade Rabbit and obtain its Elixir of Immortality?” Zhou Wen curled his lips.</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect you to defeat Jade Rabbit either, but if you want the Elixir of Immortality, you don’t necessarily have to defeat it. Others might not be able to do it, but you might be able to,” Moon Goddess said faintly.</p>
<p>“You sure have confidence in me. I’m not that confident of myself,” Zhou Wen mocked.</p>
<p>Moon Goddess said with a smile, “Didn’t you do it? Furthermore, you did it better than I imagined. Not only did you obtain the Elixirs of Immortality, but you also brought the Jade Rabbit over and made it assist you.”</p>
<p>“That’s because I’m lucky. What if I’m unlucky?” Zhou Wen snorted coldly.</p>
<p>“If you aren’t lucky, there won’t be anyone in this world with good luck,” Moon Goddess said.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“Have you ever bowed at a temple?” Moon Goddess asked.</p>
<p>“So what if I did?” Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as Moon Goddess seemed to know something.</p>
<p>“No, you haven’t bowed before because no temple’s deity will dare to accept your bow. Even I don’t dare,” Moon Goddess said.</p>
<p>“Why won’t any deities accept my bow? What’s so different about my Life Providence?” Zhou Wen finally confirmed that Moon Goddess knew something.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” </p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t accept the Moon Goddess’s answer.</p>
<p>“What an answer,” Zhou Wen said coldly.</p>
<p>“There’s no need for you to be angry. If I could completely see through your Life Providence, I wouldn’t be afraid of being worshiped by you. I can only tell that there’s something wrong with it. It shouldn’t be your Life Providence, but a Life Providence formed due to the influence of external forces. Furthermore, that Life Providence is too ferocious. If I were to receive your bow, I’m afraid I would be plagued by calamities and catastrophes. Even deities would suffer greatly,” Moon Goddess said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wish to harp on this matter as he asked, “Chang’e said that the Moon is a Companion Egg. Is that true?”</p>
<p>“Yes, the same for Earth too. However, you don’t have to worry. Earth is different from others. The Companion Beast inside won’t be born so easily.” Moon Goddess seemed to know what Zhou Wen wanted to ask.</p>
<p>“What’s the difference?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“If the Companion Beast on the Moon wants to be born, it has to wait until the Tree of Immortality dies. Otherwise, it will never be born. By the same logic, if the Companion Beast on Earth wants to be born, it needs similar conditions. However, up to now, no creature knows what those conditions are,” Moon Goddess said.</p>
<p>“Since the Companion Beast is inside the Earth, can’t we just dig it out?” Zhou Wen asked the question plaguing him. Earth wasn’t difficult to dig.</p>
<p>“A terrifying existence from another dimension tried it before. It was an existence even more terrifying than us, but in the end, Earth still remained intact, but the terrifying existence from the dimension disappeared,” Moon Goddess said.</p>
<p>“Is the terrifying existence you mentioned the owner of a ship?” Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“You actually know of the existence of that ship?” Moon Goddess was slightly surprised.</p>
<p>“Is it really that ship? What kind of creature is the owner of that ship?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. A ship tore through the sky, causing the ground to split apart and floods to occur. The world was almost destroyed, and then the ship vanished deep into the crevice in the ground. From then on, it never appeared again. No one knows who the owner of the ship is.” As the Moon Goddess spoke, she suddenly changed the topic. “Quickly feed Chang’e the Elixir of Immortality. The logger is about to forcefully cut down the Tree of Immortality. Jade Rabbit can’t stop him. Only Chang’e’s power can.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1071'>Chapter 1071: Reversing Yin and Yang</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen turned his head. He couldn’t see the logger anymore. However, he could see gorgeous flames burning around the Tree of Immortality. Wounds appeared out of thin air on the Tree of Immortality’s body as the wooden splinters that splattered out burned in the air.</p>
<p>The huge Jade Rabbit had held back, afraid it would result in collateral damage on the Tree of Immortality, before it attacked its surroundings with the jade pestle, so it had failed to hit the logger.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat afraid when he saw Jade Rabbit’s irritable look. He didn’t want it to snap the Tree of Immortality.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that if he continued hesitating, the Tree of Immortality might really be chopped down by the logger. Without any hesitation, he threw an Elixir of Immortality at the dark-gold toad that Chang’e had transformed into.</p>
<p>After Chang’e swallowed the Elixir of Immortality, a large amount of cold air immediately surged out of her, causing her body to quickly disappear as she returned to her Terror form.</p>
<p>Following that, Zhou Wen saw an extremely terrifying scene. The cold air that filled the sky surged towards the Tree of Immortality like a tsunami.</p>
<p>Everything that encountered the cold froze immediately. As for the Tree of Immortality, it became more spirited amidst the cold.</p>
<p>The logger’s flames were actually suppressed by the cold air upon contact. The range of the flames became smaller and smaller. It looked like Chang’e’s power was indeed his nemesis.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t see the logger or Chang’e, but he could tell that Chang’e had the upper hand from the dissipation of the frost and flames.</p>
<p>He summoned Jade Rabbit back, afraid that it would accidentally injure the Tree of Immortality.</p>
<p>The range of the flames became smaller and smaller. Finally, they were limited to a small area. The logger appeared again as though he could no longer maintain his Terror form.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, the logger was bound to lose if he couldn’t even maintain his Terror form, but for some reason, Zhou Wen felt his heart palpitate when he saw Wei Ge’s face. He had a nagging feeling that something was about to happen.</p>
<p>Seeing that the infinite cold air had already surged towards the logger, the remaining flames around him extinguished—he was about to be frozen in the cold air.</p>
<p>Faced with the infinite cold, the logger suddenly revealed a strange smile.</p>
<p>In the next second, the overwhelming cold gases completely drowned the logger’s figure. Apart from the cold gases, there was no other force. Not even a tiny flame could be seen.</p>
<p>The toad appeared again. At that moment, its entire body was covered in frost, as though it was an ice sculpture. Even without its Terror transformation, it still emitted a terrifying cold aura.</p>
<p>It became obvious how powerful the effects of the Elixir of Immortality were. Even now, the medicinal effects were constantly erupting.</p>
<p>What a pity. I might become a toad after taking the Elixir of Immortality. I don’t want to become a second Chang’e. Zhou Wen looked at Chang’e and saw her staring at the logger.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked over and saw that after the cold gases dissipated, the logger’s body appeared. It had already turned into an ice sculpture and was completely frozen.</p>
<p>However, when he saw the frozen Wei Ge’s expression, Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. There was a smile on his lips that sent chills down his spine.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>A tiny shattering sound could be heard using Truth Listener. It left Zhou Wen feeling extremely uneasy.</p>
<p>What was even more shocking was that inside the ice sculpture, the logger’s body gradually turned into ice jade. Not only did the cold gases on him fail to injure him, but they also made his strength increase.</p>
<p>“How is this possible! He clearly has fire-elemental powers, and it’s a fire-elemental power that has already Terror transformed. How can he suddenly switch to ice?” Ice Maiden was alarmed as she stared at the logger in disbelief.</p>
<p>The toad also wore a solemn expression, but it was also somewhat puzzled. Clearly, it couldn’t figure out why the power of the logger had turned into an ice-elemental power.</p>
<p>“Not good.” Moon Goddess’s voice entered Zhou Wen’s ears. Almost at the same time, the ice on the logger’s body completely shattered as he regained his freedom.</p>
<p>At that moment, the logger’s body suffused extremely terrifying cold gases. They didn’t look any weaker than the cold gases emitted by the toad.</p>
<p>“I never expected that I would have to rely on the strength of this human body to redeem the situation.” The logger raised his arm and looked at his palm. “Although this body is very weak, his Life Soul is surprisingly interesting. It has the ability to reverse Yin and Yang. Even I benefited greatly from it. I really have to thank him.”</p>
<p>“Oh no! The Elixir of Immortality is refined from the Tree of Immortality that has the Yin attribute. It can boost Chang’e’s Yin attribute and is very useful against fire-elemental powers. However, now that the logger has switched to the ice attribute, Chang’e’s ability to suppress him has greatly weakened. It’s impossible to kill or suppress him now. Once the effects of the Elixir of Immortality fade, no one will be able to stop the logger. It looks like the Moon will really be doomed this time.” Moon Goddess sighed.</p>
<p>“Is there no other way?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>Although he still had two Elixirs of Immortality, they were no longer key to victory. It would be useless even if he was willing to give them both to Chang’e.</p>
<p>“As you can see, Jade Rabbit’s strength is excessively ferocious. If we let it stop the logger, I’m afraid the Tree of Immortality will be destroyed by it. That ice demon from the dimension has only just entered the Terror grade. It’s too weak, so it’s impossible for it to stop the logger.” Moon Goddess sighed softly. “The lunar calamity is inevitable. I wonder where my Moon Goddess Temple will go in the future.”</p>
<p>Chang’e transformed into her Terror form again as she charged toward the logger. The logger clenched his fist, and the power of frost condensed in his palm, transforming into a frost ax. It then disappeared, transforming into a dazzling ice beam.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t see the battle between the two Terror creatures, but the Tree of Immortality was riddled with wounds from the ice beams. The damage intensified.</p>
<p>As the Tree of Immortality was injured, the entire Moon began to tremble. Deep ravines appeared on the Moon as they constantly spread. It looked like the end of the world was approaching.</p>
<p>Is the Moon really going to be destroyed? Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>“Leave. I’m afraid there won’t be a moon from now on.” Moon Goddess’s voice sounded. Shen Yuchi and Wang Qiuyuan, who had been frozen in front of the Moon Goddess Temple, had also recovered.</p>
<p>However, they had no idea what situation they were in. They looked at the quaking and cracking ground with eyes filled with horror.</p>
<p>If Earth is really like the Moon and is a Companion Egg, if those fellows in the dimension really find a way to bring it to life, then humans… Zhou Wen looked at the Moon that was on the brink of destruction and could already imagine what Earth would look like.</p>
<p>The earth would fracture, volcanoes would erupt, and seawater would drown everything. Humans had nowhere to hide. 99.99% of over 10 billion humans would die in a short period of time.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Perhaps a small number of people could use external forces to escape from Earth, but they would be in the ultra-minority.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1072'>Chapter 1072: Then Let’s Give It A Shot</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Now that the Moon is being destroyed, I can still escape back to Earth. If Earth is destroyed in the future, where can I escape to? Zhou Wen looked solemnly at the Tree of Immortality that was beginning to tilt.</p>
<p>The legendary Tree of Immortality had the ability to recover on its own, but under the power of the logger, the damage to the Tree of Immortality’s body didn’t automatically heal and was constantly expanding.</p>
<p>“Go. It will be too late for you to leave once the Tree of Immortality falls.” Moon Goddess’s voice sounded from the Moon Goddess Temple.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi and Wang Qiuyuan turned around and ran in the direction of the spacecraft. As the Moon had cracked open, many cracks had appeared around Toad Palace and the Moon’s crust. There was no need for them to leave through the door.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t move. He looked at the Tree of Immortality and asked, “You are the Moon Goddess, the ruler of the Moon. With such powerful strength, why can’t you stop him?”</p>
<p>Moon Goddess sighed softly and said, “Because I’m a creature born on the Moon. The logger can disobey the Moon’s rules, but I can’t. It’s ironic. As a creature of the Moon, I can only break free from the restrictions and use my powers as I wish after the Moon shatters.”</p>
<p>“Then if you were given a choice, do you want to preserve the Moon, or do you want freedom and strength?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I’ve lived here for countless years, so I’m too lazy to move.” Moon Goddess said with a bitter smile, “From the looks of it, there’s nothing I can do even if I don’t want to move.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s give it a shot and see if we can protect the Moon,” Zhou Wen said as he took out a calabash. Zhou Wen released the Seven Seas Dragon King. At the same time, he released Grim Demon from the Demonic Sword.</p>
<p>“Grim Demon, no matter what method you use, protect that tree,” Zhou Wen said as he pointed at the distant Tree of Immortality.</p>
<p>“I only have one method… That is… to kill…” Grim Demon’s eyes were filled with a ruthless killing intent. It transformed into a demonic aura that filled the sky and swept towards the Tree of Immortality.</p>
<p>Grim Demon! So Grim Demon is Zhou Wen’s Guardian! Shen Yuchi’s heart started racing when he saw Grim Demon.</p>
<p>Grim Demon became famous from a single battle. He had trounced his challenger, and humanity was guessing who he belonged to.</p>
<p>He never expected Grim Demon to be Zhou Wen’s Guardian.</p>
<p>It’s actually his. In that case, those Mythical Companion Beasts are also Zhou Wen’s. They don’t belong to any family? Many thoughts flashed through Shen Yuchi’s mind as he looked at the distant Zhou Wen with a complicated expression. He gritted his teeth and quickly fled.</p>
<p>Moon Goddess was also somewhat surprised, but her surprise was completely different from Shen Yuchi’s.</p>
<p>It wasn’t rare to have a Guardian. It was normal for a human like Zhou Wen to be fancied by a Guardian.</p>
<p>However, the Guardian didn’t come from Zhou Wen. Instead, it came from Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast’s sword. Moon Goddess had never heard of a Guardian being attached to a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this was a Terror-grade Guardian. This was even more shocking.</p>
<p>Grim Demon rushed over and engaged in a crazy battle with the logger. It was the toad that played the supporting role.</p>
<p>Unlike the toad, Grim Demon didn’t consider stopping the logger at all. He only wanted to kill his opponent.</p>
<p>He attacked, unleashing crazy attacks.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could clearly tell that the logger no longer had the energy to chop the tree.</p>
<p>After receiving Zhou Wen’s order, the Seven Seas Dragon King also moved. However, it didn’t participate in the battle. Instead, it charged at the Tree of Immortality and spewed the glue-like liquid at its damaged spots.</p>
<p>As the power of the logger was special, it seemed to have a restraining effect on the Tree of Immortality, making it difficult for the wound to automatically heal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have powerful Companion Beasts that could heal the Tree of Immortality’s damage in a short period of time. Therefore, he got the Seven Seas Dragon King to use glue to cover the damaged spots.</p>
<p>Even if the logger extricated himself from Grim Demon and the toad and wanted to chop the tree again, he had to either destroy the glue or chop from another angle. Either choice could buy a lot of time for the Tree of Immortality.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen didn’t believe that the glue could really ward off the logger. This was because the Seven Seas Dragon King’s ability was actually restrained by ice and fire-elemental powers.</p>
<p>This was also the reason Zhou Wen didn’t get the Seven Seas Dragon King to participate in the battle. It was restrained by the logger, so it had little effect.</p>
<p>Grim Demon had already become the main force in the battle against the logger, and Chang’e’s role was gradually diminishing.</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit also wanted to help, but its body was too big. With one strike, it nearly sent Grim Demon flying. With it attacking the logger together with Grim Demon, not only did it fail to gain the upper hand, but it nearly injured Grim Demon a few times. Zhou Wen had no choice but to summon it back.</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit crouched by the side with an aggrieved look, as though it knew that it had done something wrong.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have the ability to participate in the battle so he picked up some fallen petals and put them away. They might be useful in the future.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>With a loud bang, the toad was sent flying. It slammed into the trunk of the Tree of Immortality and spat out large amounts of blood.</p>
<p>The ax wounds on its body crisscrossed and it was powerless to enter its Terror firm. It didn’t look like it had the ability to continue fighting.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Grim Demon was surprisingly resilient. He wasn’t at a disadvantage even when fighting the logger alone.</p>
<p>What Grim Demon said in the past might not have been bragging. His combat strength is indeed off the charts, Zhou Wen thought to himself. If he’s really as powerful as he says but is so humble in front of Neonate, what’s Neonate’s background?</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate had too many secrets. Before she had been absorbed by the Dead Man Tree, Zhou Wen couldn’t even tell if she was a dimensional creature or a human. She was a unique existence.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, he saw a change in the situation. Without Chang’e’s participation in the battle, the logger switched his stats to fire.</p>
<p>Terrifying flames spewed out, turning into a sea of flames which enveloped a large area near the Tree of Immortality. Its leaves and petals, as well as its trunk, immediately burned upon contact with the flames.</p>
<p>Grim Demon had powerful combat strength, but he wasn’t good at protecting others. He only wanted to kill the logger before the Tree of Immortality was burned down.</p>
<p>However, the logger’s strength was equally unfathomable. Grim Demon failed to gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>Just as the Tree of Immortality was on the brink of incineration, the Moon’s tremors intensified. Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss as to how he could resolve his present predicament.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was hesitating about whether he should use the Ice Dragon King’s Tooth to see if he could extinguish the flames on the Tree of Immortality, he suddenly felt a strange force and thought coming from his body.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy’s evolution is complete! Zhou Wen was immediately overjoyed when he sensed her will.</p>
<p>3</p>
<h3 id='chapter1073'>Chapter 1073: A Cool Breeze</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen was near the Moon Goddess Temple. With the Moon Goddess around, the logger didn’t dare enter the area.</p>
<p>However, the Tree of Immortality was being consumed by the flames. If he didn’t save it, it would probably be charred in a few hours.</p>
<p>Huge cracks constantly appeared on the Moon’s surface. This was clearly a sign that the Companion Beast inside was about to appear.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to see the changes in Banana Fairy’s stats. He summoned her immediately.</p>
<p>With a flash of light, a young woman wearing a white veil was sitting on a banana leaf that resembled a boat. Her snow-white feet were swaying playfully.</p>
<p>Her face was beautifully delicate, but her figure was petite. As the banana leaf floated in the air, she looked like a fairy.</p>
<p>“Little Fairy, can you help me extinguish the flames on that tree?” Zhou Wen pointed at the flames on the Tree of Immortality.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy blinked and looked in the direction of the Tree of Immortality. Then, she opened her red lips and spat out a cool breeze.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was filled with anticipation. Banana Fairy’s Supreme Yin Wind was known as the Three Realms’ Best Wind. Furthermore, it was Yin-elemental. It should have an extremely powerful restraining effect on flames.</p>
<p>With the help of the Supreme Yin Wind, he might have a chance of defeating the logger.</p>
<p>A cool breeze silently blew into the darkness.</p>
<p>The wind that blew out of Banana Fairy’s mouth was just too weak.</p>
<p>“Little Fairy, use more strength!” Zhou Wen was somewhat anxious. After all, the other party was a top existence at the Terror grade. He didn’t know if Banana Fairy’s casual blow would be effective.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, Zhou Wen’s mouth gaped open.</p>
<p>The cool wind that looked like a breeze immediately extinguished the flames and demonic aura when it came into contact with them. As for the demonic aura, it dissipated.</p>
<p>In an instant, the demonic aura that had filled the area vanished without a trace. The terrifying fire was also extinguished. Not even a wisp of smoke remained as though the fire had never existed.</p>
<p>Bam! Bam!</p>
<p>Grim Demon and the logger slammed into the trunk of the Tree of Immortality, but they didn’t fall. Their limbs stuck to the trunk, unable to move in the wind. The muscles on their faces were distorted by the wind, and frost formed on their brows and hair.</p>
<p>If not for the Tree of Immortality, they would have been blown into space.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was at a loss for words. After a long while, he exclaimed, “Holy sh*t! Isn’t this a little too strong?”</p>
<p>Only when this gust of wind passed did Grim Demon and the logger fall from the tree trunk. They failed to get up immediately.</p>
<p>“Supreme Yin Wind!” Moon Goddess’s voice was somewhat odd.</p>
<p>She was Lady Supreme Yin, so she was naturally no stranger to the Supreme Yin Wind. She immediately recognized it.</p>
<p>However, she found it unbelievable that a Companion Beast could use the Supreme Yin Wind, and this Companion Beast was Zhou Wen’s.</p>
<p>The logger changed his stats again, turning from fire to ice. He condensed an ice ax and threw it at Banana Fairy.</p>
<p>The ice ax vanished in midair. All that could be seen was ice swirling over.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy sat on the banana leaf without dodging. She pouted her red lips and blew out another mouthful of fragrance.</p>
<p>However, the wind this time wasn’t as cool as before. Instead, it was scorching.</p>
<p>When the fragrant wind encountered the power of the ice ax, blazing white flames appeared out of thin air. Instantly, the ice ax completely melted. From ice to water, then from water to steam, it finally turned into nothingness in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>The strong wind swept over with flames and devoured the logger’s body. It instantly melted the ice aura and his body immediately burned.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>“We’re on the same side… We’re on the same side…” Another tragic cry sounded. It was Grim Demon, who had just gotten up and was standing not far from the logger. He was implicated as his demonic aura caught fire, turning him into a flaming man.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy’s wind was good at everything, but its area was just too wide. It didn’t distinguish between friend and foe, causing Grim Demon to be implicated.</p>
<p>“Supreme Yang Wind!” Moon Goddess was even more bewildered.</p>
<p>Supreme Yin and Supreme Yang were two conflicting attributes, and they were two extremes. A Companion Beast actually had the ability to control Supreme Yin Wind and Supreme Yang Wind at the same time. This was just too terrifying.</p>
<p>If she can advance to the Calamity grade… Moon Goddess didn’t dare imagine such a scene. Just with one gust of the wind, even Earth would probably suffer an apocalyptic end, much less the Moon.</p>
<p>“Ahem… Little Fairy… That’s one of us…” Zhou Wen hurriedly helped Grim Demon resolve the situation.</p>
<p>It was unknown what kind of fire Banana Fairy’s flames were, but Grim Demon failed to extinguish the flames on his body. He cried out from the heat.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy blew out another gust of wind. This time, it was the Supreme Yin Wind. As the breeze brushed past, the flames on Grim Demon’s body immediately extinguished.</p>
<p>Just as the logger turned into the fire attribute and wanted to absorb the flames on his body, the flames on his body were extinguished by the Supreme Yin Wind. Then, she saw Grim Demon and the logger fly out together.</p>
<p>Bam! Bam!</p>
<p>They slammed into the Tree of Immortality again and had their limbs plastered to the tree trunk. After the Supreme Yin Wind blew, they fell again.</p>
<p>Grim Demon didn’t dare continue staying there. He could tell that this unknown Companion Beast was a destroyer who didn’t distinguish between friend and foe. She was even more unscrupulous than himself. If he stayed, due to her whims, it might be the end of him.</p>
<p>The logger struggled to get up after falling from the tree, but he suddenly held his chest. His chest seemed to have been pierced by an invisible sword.</p>
<p>Blood flowed down the invisible sword hilt and dripped onto the ground.</p>
<p>The logger wanted to pull out the Demonic Sword, but he felt his strength rapidly disappearing. He knew that he had no chance of fighting again.</p>
<p>“I’ve waited for countless years. I never expected such an outcome.” The logger sat under the Tree of Immortality and looked up at the osmanthus petals dancing in the sky. However, there wasn’t much anger or hatred on his face.</p>
<p>He extended his hand and caught a petal. He held it in his palm and stared at it, but his gaze wasn’t focused on the petal. It was as though his emotions had flown elsewhere.</p>
<p>“Back then, I was focused on cultivating and attempted to escape my mortal coils. Instead, I neglected the most important person… This can be considered my retribution… Sorry for making you wait so long… I’ll be accompanying you soon…” As the logger spoke, he slowly looked up and his gaze landed on the distant Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me he wants to self-destruct and drag me down with him? Zhou Wen subconsciously took a few steps back.</p>
<p>To his surprise, the logger said, “Do you have anyone you want to protect?”</p>
<p>“If not, I wouldn’t have stopped you,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That’s good. Be careful of those fellows in the dimension. Don’t believe their so-called rules.” The logger nodded before closing his eyes. “Unfortunately, I won’t be able to see the day you cut down the Tree of Immortality.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1074'>Chapter 1074: Birth from Extreme Death</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen was just about to ask when he saw that the logger had stopped moving. There were no longer any signs of life—he was probably dead.</p>
<p>Why don’t you make yourself clear before you die! Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. However, from the looks of it, the logger didn’t seem to have any intention of saying anything else. Otherwise, he would have said it before he died.</p>
<p>However, it was difficult to guess what the logger had meant.</p>
<p>There were many interpretations for this sentence. Perhaps it was because Zhou Wen couldn’t resist the temptation and wanted to obtain the Companion Beast on the Moon, so he had come to chop down the Tree of Immortality.</p>
<p>It could also be that there was some secret beneath the Tree of Immortality. In the future, Zhou Wen would have to chop down the Tree of Immortality to find out the secret.</p>
<p>There were too many possibilities. It was also possible that the logger had said it casually to deliberately arouse Zhou Wen’s curiosity.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to continue guessing. At the very least, from the looks of it, the Moon’s continued existence was better than it being destroyed.</p>
<p>As he walked towards the logger, Zhou Wen planned on bringing his corpse back. After all, this body belonged to Wei Ge. At the very least, he could return his body to his family in one piece.</p>
<p>When he arrived in front of the corpse, Zhou Wen extended his hands and placed them under the corpse’s armpits. Just as he was about to lift the corpse up, he suddenly saw the eyes widen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s reaction was extremely fast as he instantly made a decision. If he retreated, he would have fallen for the logger’s scheme. Therefore, Zhou Wen did the opposite. Instead of retreating, he advanced and pressed his body against the logger’s body. His hands passed through his armpits before grabbing his neck. He wanted to use force to snap his neck.</p>
<p>“It’s… It’s me… Don’t… Cough, cough…” The logger said a few words before his neck was pressed down by a powerful force, preventing him from saying a word.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but slow down when he heard those words. He didn’t continue.</p>
<p>This was because the pitch and tone of the words didn’t sound like the logger’s. Instead, they sounded like Wei Ge’s.</p>
<p>“President Wei?” Zhou Wen released his hand and retreated as he looked at Wei Ge in disbelief.</p>
<p>If it was the logger, he would have killed him, but it also seemed impossible for it to be Wei Ge.</p>
<p>Be it Wei Ge’s consciousness controlling the body or the logger’s consciousness controlling the body, the injuries this body suffered were fatal. It was useless no matter whose consciousness it was. If the body died, the consciousness could only perish.</p>
<p>The wound on Wei Ge’s chest was still there. His heart had been pierced through. The logger was dead, so how could Wei Ge still be alive?</p>
<p>“It’s me.” Wei Ge looked down at the wound on his chest and said with a grimace, “I don’t have much time left. Quickly think of a way to save me. Think of a way to stabilize my injuries first. Just don’t let me die.”</p>
<p>“Are you really President Wei?” Zhou Wen looked at Wei Ge suspiciously. He was somewhat suspicious that the logger wasn’t dead and was trying to trick Zhou Wen into treating him.</p>
<p>“Do you still remember when I went to look for you after graduation? We even chatted a little. Do you remember the sentence about ‘barely defeat the heavens?’” Wei Ge said.</p>
<p>“The logger has occupied the body, so he might have absorbed your memories…” Zhou Wen looked at Wei Ge warily.</p>
<p>Wei Ge didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. “My dear junior, I’m really Wei Ge. Previously, I recognized that the bone pottery artifact was a sacrificial offering to invite a deity’s descent. I knew that I might be possessed by some kind of spiritual body. Furthermore, I also knew that Shen Yuchi would most likely make me a sacrifice. Therefore, it was better to take the initiative to touch the bone pottery artifact.”</p>
<p>“My Life Providence is Birth from Extreme Death. It’s too troublesome to explain. To put it simply, after my body dies, I can still exist in a living-dead state for a period of time. If I heal my body during this period of time, I can still live. I can’t hold on much longer. If you don’t treat my injuries, I’ll really die…” Wei Ge said gloomily.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that his tone and demeanor were indeed different from the logger’s. He believed him a little.</p>
<p>This was because Zhou Wen had previously determined that Wei Ge might know the origins of the bone pottery artifact, so he had taken the initiative to take it. He definitely had some means.</p>
<p>Previously, Zhou Wen had believed that Wei Ge’s judgment was wrong, so his means had failed to take effect and he had ended up dying tragically.</p>
<p>Without much hesitation, Zhou Wen switched to the Primordial Human Sovereign Life Soul and threw a punch at Wei Ge’s wound.</p>
<p>The fist blasted into Wei Ge’s heart, but when it pulled out, the wound on his heart healed significantly.</p>
<p>Berserk punches came one after another. Under the strange force, the fatal blow to Wei Ge’s heart miraculously healed completely. There was no longer any wound on his chest.</p>
<p>However, due to the excessive blood loss, Wei Ge’s body was still on the brink of failure.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned a few more pill essences like the Rejuvenation Pill and got Wei Ge to swallow them. Only then did his body recover its vitality. As for the glow in Wei Ge’s eyes, it grew stronger and stronger. Soon, he was back to being a healthy person.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, I’ll have to thank you for your help. Otherwise, I would have really died here,” Wei Ge said as he stood up.</p>
<p>“If the logger hadn’t died, would you have been able to retrieve your body?” Zhou Wen asked Wei Ge.</p>
<p>“No.” Wei Ge shook his head.</p>
<p>“If I hadn’t treated your injuries, would you have lived?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“No.” Wei Ge shook his head again.</p>
<p>“Then why did you make such a bet?” Zhou Wen felt that the conditions for survival were too harsh. If he wasn’t here, Wei Ge would definitely be dead.</p>
<p>“As there are benefits that are hundreds or even thousands of times greater, it was worth taking the risk. The logger used my body and died in my body. The wealth he left behind for this body is unimaginable. It was worth betting my life.” Wei Ge smiled and continued, “Of course, there’s another important reason why I was willing to take the bet.”</p>
<p>“What was it?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Because you are here,” Wei Ge said solemnly.</p>
<p>“You think too highly of me.” Zhou Wen shook his head and smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen and company were on the Moon, the ranking battle on Earth continued. Ya constantly faced challenges from different Guardians and had yet to be defeated.</p>
<p>However, Ya’s various abilities were constantly probed by the Guardians. Furthermore, the opponents that appeared were getting stronger. His victories became increasingly hard-won, but he still hadn’t lost.</p>
<p>In Forbidden City that was enveloped by fog, a distorted figure descended from the void. The figure was very similar to the figure that had changed the cube’s battle rules twice. Or rather, it was the same creature.</p>
<p>The figure floated in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony. The door to the Hall of Supreme Harmony seemed to be opened automatically by some invisible force. In the hall, there was a log lying flat.</p>
<p>“Polestar, why haven’t you chosen a contractor yet?” An ethereal voice sounded from the figure made of light and shadows.</p>
<p>“That’s my business. What has it got to do with you?” A cold woman’s voice sounded from the log.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1075'>Chapter 1075: True Terror Grade</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“As a Guardian, you should know your mission,” the figure said as it looked down at the log in the Hall of Supreme Harmony.</p>
<p>“My mission has long ended. Don’t you already have a new Guardian? Why are you still looking for me?” The woman in the log snorted coldly.</p>
<p>“It hasn’t been long since the new Guardian came into existence. It hasn’t grown to a sufficiently strong stage. It’s not enough to vie for first place,” said the figure.</p>
<p>“What has that got to do with me?” The woman’s voice was cold and heartless.</p>
<p>“If you defeat Ya, you can return to the dimension and obtain a good status,” the figure said.</p>
<p>The woman suddenly laughed, her laughter filled with mockery. “Aren’t you all known to be omnipotent high-level lifeforms? Can’t you even deal with a fellow who’s half human and half Guardian?”</p>
<p>“After you return to the dimension, you can dominate a region.” There was no change in the figure’s voice.</p>
<p>“Not interested,” the woman said without hesitation.</p>
<p>“A divine fruit,” the figure continued.</p>
<p>“Keep it for yourself,” the woman mocked.</p>
<p>“Ten.” The figure remained emotionless.</p>
<p>“Are you that afraid of Ya getting first place?” The woman didn’t reject his offer immediately this time.</p>
<p>“He’s not a Guardian. There’s already one Wang Mingyuan. There’s no need for a second or third one. The Lord of Earth has to be a Guardian,” the figure said.</p>
<p>“The King of Earth can’t even have half a human’s bloodline? How ironic. Humans are the original owners of Earth.”</p>
<p>“What can make you take action?” asked the figure.</p>
<p>“I haven’t found a suitable contractor. I don’t plan on taking action.” The woman actually rejected the figure again.</p>
<p>“You aren’t the only Guardian who survived that era. If they were to obtain ten divine fruits, you should know what that will imply.” There was finally some emotion in the figure’s voice. One could clearly sense that his tone had turned cold.</p>
<p>“So what if I know?” the woman said indifferently.</p>
<p>“As long as you defeat an ordinary Mythical creature, you can obtain ten divine fruits. It’s impossible for such a good thing to happen a second time. Don’t regret it.” The figure regained its calm.</p>
<p>“Nothing can make me, Empress Polestar, regret it,” the woman said.</p>
<p>The figure didn’t say anything else as it gradually vanished into the void. Finally, it completely vanished.</p>
<p>After Empress Polestar sensed that the light figure had vanished, she muttered to herself, “An ordinary Mythical? I’m afraid it’s not that simple. Otherwise, why would you come looking for me?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>On the Moon, Zhou Wen was sitting in front of a huge cube.</p>
<p>After saving Wei Ge, Zhou Wen had originally planned on punishing Shen Yuchi, but Wei Ge convinced him otherwise.</p>
<p>In fact, Wei Ge didn’t say much. All he did was tell Zhou Wen, “Leave him alive. With me around, the bureau will be your eyes and ears in the future.”</p>
<p>With Wei Ge’s words, Zhou Wen didn’t seek trouble with Shen Yuchi again. He got the Great Might Vajra Bull to take Wei Ge back to the spacecraft while he remained on the Moon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had originally planned on using Glimmer to teleport back. He didn’t need to take the spacecraft back, so he got Wei Ge to return with them.</p>
<p>As for how Wei Ge would subdue Shen Yuchi and the bureau, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to know. Even if Wei Ge didn’t succeed, Zhou Wen already had the strength necessary to destroy the bureau at any time.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>However, before returning to Earth, Zhou Wen still wanted to obtain more petals of the Tree of Immortality.</p>
<p>However, the Moon Goddess had told him that the Tree of Immortality was severely injured. It was best not to pluck its petals and wait for it to recover.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to pick up the petals that had fallen nearby. He didn’t touch the petals on the tree again. He knew the principle of economizing to ensure long-term benefits.</p>
<p>After touring the Moon, he realized that there was a cube here. Zhou Wen watched several battles here, all between Ya and the Guardian.</p>
<p>A battle at this level can’t even withstand a single breath from my Little Fairy. Every time Zhou Wen made a comparison, he felt that Banana Fairy was much stronger. Typical Mythical and Terror-grade creatures couldn’t compare.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy: Terror (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Yin Yang Spirit Root</p>
<p>Life Soul: Fairy in the Wind</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Three Realms’ Best Wind</p>
<p>Terror form: Apeiron Perfected Immortal (S-grade)</p>
<p>Strength: 82</p>
<p>Speed: 82</p>
<p>Constitution: 82</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 82</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Supreme Yin Wind, Supreme Yang Wind, Immeasurable Wind.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Fan</p>
<p>Banana Fairy’s evolution was very strange. This was because ordinary creatures wouldn’t change their Life Providences or Life Souls. However, with Banana Fairy’s evolution, even her Life Soul and Life Providences had changed. This was a phenomenon Zhou Wen had never seen before.</p>
<p>Furthermore, she was different from Demonic Neonate. Demonic Neonate was still at the Mythical stage, but she had the ability to transform into a Terror form. Zhou Wen originally believed that the Terror grade was only a state of the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>However, from the looks of it, above the Mythical stage was the Terror grade, not just a state. Banana Fairy was a true Terror grade. Demonic Neonate hadn’t truly reached the Terror grade, but for some reason, she had the ability to transform into a Terror form.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen guessed that it had something to do with her Wheel of Destiny, but he couldn’t be sure.</p>
<p>Then there was Banana Fairy’s stats. Although she had broken through the limits of the Mythical stage of 81 points, she didn’t directly reach a certain value like before. All her stats had only increased by a little.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suspected that after achieving the Terror grade, Banana Fairy might need to slowly raise her stats like humans. As for the limit of the Terror grade, Zhou Wen wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>According to the previous standards, the limit should be double the previous stage, but this was only speculation.</p>
<p>As for how powerful Banana Fairy’s Terror Transformation ability was, Zhou Wen had no idea. This was because once Banana Fairy completely transformed into her Terror form, even Zhou Wen—as her master—couldn’t see her.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>The only thing he was certain of was that Banana Fairy was very strong.</p>
<p>As he was pondering over it, he saw the cube light up again. Another Guardian had challenged Ya. However, the name that challenged Ya this time made Zhou Wen’s pupils involuntarily contract.</p>
<p>Night Thearch… He has finally joined the battle… Zhou Wen was somewhat worried. Zhong Ziya might not know that Night Thearch was at the Terror grade. If Zhong Ziya ended up trapped in Night Thearch’s Evernight domain without being aware of it, he might end up being killed without even having the chance to surrender.</p>
<p>After all, only the Terror grade could defeat the Terror grade. Zhong Ziya and Primordial Sword Immortal had yet to reach the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya quickly accepted the challenge, making Zhou Wen even more worried. From the looks of it, Zhong Ziya likely didn’t know of Night Thearch’s existence.</p>
<p>Night Thearch entered the cube’s arena and stood in midair as he stared at Zhong Ziya and said, “I don’t want to kill you, so you should admit defeat yourself.”</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya looked up at Night Thearch. No one could see his expression behind the mask, but Zhong Ziya’s words made Zhou Wen secretly heave a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“I’m more interested to know how strong the Terror grade is.” Zhong Ziya slowly pulled out Primordial Immortal Sword.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1076'>Chapter 1076: Never Cares About Consequences</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“To me, you are a work of art. Don’t give me the chance to personally destroy you,” Night Thearch said.</p>
<p>“Compared to being a work of art, I want to be a tool without any beauty,” Zhong Ziya said.</p>
<p>“Since you insist on fighting, then attack,” Night Thearch said calmly.</p>
<p>“I had the same thought,” Zhong Ziya said as he fused with his sword and transformed into a stream of light that streaked towards Night Thearch.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya’s sword techniques and movement techniques were already at the Mythical stage and weren’t inferior to Zhou Wen’s. In fact, due to the augmentation of his Mythical attributes, he was even stronger than Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, no matter how terrifying the Primordial Immortal Sword in his hand was, it couldn’t touch Night Thearch’s clothes. Night Thearch was like a ghost, his figure unpredictable. Zhong Ziya’s sword was always three inches away from him, so he couldn’t hit him.</p>
<p>“It’s really perfect. You’re better than I imagined.” Night Thearch praised as he dodged Zhong Ziya’s sword.</p>
<p>Others might think that Night Thearch was mocking Zhong Ziya, but Zhou Wen knew that Night Thearch didn’t have any intention of mocking him. Those words were most likely heartfelt.</p>
<p>Night Thearch was just too odd. He could kill ten million people without any guilt. It could be said that he was a true devil.</p>
<p>However, he especially indulged those humans with excellent talent. Even though Zhou Wen was his enemy and had nearly killed him, Night Thearch didn’t take any revenge.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t completely understand his mentality. He felt that he was a strange person that couldn’t be fathomed.</p>
<p>“Your sword is very determined. This is very good, but it’s still not good enough,” Night Thearch continued.</p>
<p>“How is it not good enough?” Zhong Ziya’s sword streaked across Night Thearch’s face, almost touching him, but he ultimately failed to touch Night Thearch.</p>
<p>“It’s not focused enough.” Night Thearch flashed past Zhong Ziya like a ghost.</p>
<p>“My sword has no distracting thoughts.” Zhong Ziya turned the Primordial Immortal Sword in his hand and stabbed in a direction that had nothing but thin air. Night Thearch was not there.</p>
<p>In the next second, the space around the area changed. The two of them seemed to have been swapped. Zhong Ziya’s seemingly missed strike stabbed right in front of Night Thearch.</p>
<p>“Just because there aren’t any distracting thoughts doesn’t mean that one is sufficiently focused.” Night Thearch’s body was similar to the dawn-like darkness as he silently retreated. That strange strike kept advancing in front of his nose, but it was like the light of dawn which couldn’t touch the night sky. It was forever a distance away from Night Thearch.</p>
<p>As he fought, Night Thearch said, “Your sword is too sentimental. It can’t be devoted. If you want to use a sword, you have to be devoted to the sword. If you want to kill someone, you have to devote all your attention to the process of killing. You have too many emotions in your heart, so it’s inevitable that you will be distracted. That’s why you can’t focus.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that there’s anyone in this world who can be absolutely focused.” Zhong Ziya constantly attacked, his sword techniques and skills changing.</p>
<p>One after another, his illusory clones charged at Night Thearch from all directions, but Night Thearch dodged them again and again.</p>
<p>“Indeed not, but I’ve seen one who came extremely close. He’s more heartless than you and closer to a focused state than you. However, you aren’t bad either. If you can turn emotions into extreme emotions, you might surpass him,” Night Thearch said.</p>
<p>“I think I know who you’re talking about. He’s indeed very strong.” Zhong Ziya suddenly threw out the sword in his hand. Primordial Immortal Sword split into millions of identical ones in the air and rained down on Night Thearch.</p>
<p>However, Night Thearch stood there without moving. He allowed the millions of ancient swords to pass through his body, but none of the swords could injure him.</p>
<p>He didn’t take on his Terror form. The swords didn’t injure him. Not because of the power of the Terror transformation; instead, it was because the swords were only illusions that didn’t really exist.</p>
<p>“He also has his flaws. Compared to you, he’s too conservative and can’t accept new powers. This is a fatal flaw. Therefore, in comparison, I think more highly of you. You have a chance to improve further.” Night Thearch suddenly made a move. His two fingers grabbed the real Primordial Immortal Sword amidst the millions of illusory Primordial Immortal Swords.</p>
<p>The Primordial Immortal Sword trembled and hummed between his fingers, but it couldn’t move at all.</p>
<p>“Leave. Your time hasn’t come yet. I’m looking forward to the arrival of that era.” Night Thearch casually waved his hand, and Primordial Immortal Sword flew back and entered the scabbard in Zhong Ziya’s other hand.</p>
<p>This battle dazzled everyone. Everyone was shocked by Night Thearch’s strength.</p>
<p>Ya, who had been undefeated and almost invincible, seemed to have been easily suppressed in front of Night Thearch.</p>
<p>“Time waits for no man.” Zhong Ziya had no intention of retreating.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to kill you before, much less now. However, you have to leave this place,” Night Thearch said with a frown.</p>
<p>“Before I get first place, I definitely won’t die, nor will I leave,” Zhong Ziya said firmly.</p>
<p>“Is there something more important than death?” Night Thearch asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Zhong Ziya answered with certainty.</p>
<p>“Then let me see if you have the qualifications to stay.” As Night Thearch spoke, he took a step forward. In that instant, the entire arena turned into an eternal night.</p>
<p>The cube’s big screen turned pitch-black, and nothing could be seen. Only the sound of armor tearing could be heard.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the arena lit up again.</p>
<p>Night Thearch had already returned to his original spot, and Ya was still there. However, many wounds had opened up on his cloak and armor. Blood was constantly flowing out, dyeing his armor red.</p>
<p>“Go back,” Night Thearch said.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Zhong Ziya suddenly said.</p>
<p>Before Night Thearch could figure out what Zhong Ziya meant by ‘thank you’, he saw that the wound on Zhong Ziya’s body was no longer bleeding, but effusing light.</p>
<p>The light was corroding his body, gradually turning his flesh and blood into light.</p>
<p>“Terror form…” Night Thearch looked at Zhong Ziya in surprise. Clearly, Zhong Ziya was transforming into his Terror form.</p>
<p>“Kill him.” A voice entered Night Thearch’s mind.</p>
<p>Night Thearch looked at the Terror-form Zhong Ziya and knew that this was a critical moment for his advancement. This was the best opportunity to kill him. Once he completed the Terror transformation, it wouldn’t be so easy to kill him.</p>
<p>However, Night Thearch only stood there and watched without any intention of attacking.</p>
<p>“I said kill him. Didn’t you hear me?” The voice entered Night Thearch’s mind again.</p>
<p>Night Thearch remained unmoved as though he hadn’t heard anything.</p>
<p>“Do you know the consequences of violating our agreement?” The voice was already somewhat angry.</p>
<p>“I, Night Thearch, never care about consequences,” Night Thearch said indifferently.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>In the dimension, a distorted figure of light and shadow roared angrily. Terror-grade force crushed everything nearby into powder, but it was still unable to vent the anger in his heart.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1077'>Chapter 1077: Origins of the Dimensional Wheel</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Before long, Ya’s body completely transformed into light. On the cube’s screen, only a humanoid figure could be seen. If he moved slightly, the dazzling light would change, preventing anyone from seeing his appearance.</p>
<p>Instead, because Primordial Immortal Sword had yet to reach the Terror grade, it remained in Ya’s hand.</p>
<p>“The Guardian you fused with was already at the Terror grade?” Night Thearch asked as he admired Zhong Ziya who had transformed into the Terror form.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Zhong Ziya answered.</p>
<p>“With your strength, it should be impossible for you to absorb such a Guardian. How did you do it?” Night Thearch continued asking.</p>
<p>“A betting contract,” Zhong Ziya answered.</p>
<p>Others might not understand what a betting contract was, but Night Thearch knew very well. When he heard that, he asked with a heavy expression, “What did you bet with him?”</p>
<p>“First on the rankings,” Zhong Ziya answered.</p>
<p>Night Thearch laughed. “Do you know how difficult this path is? It’s impossible for the alien races in all the worlds to let even half a human become the final victor.”</p>
<p>“Only with difficulty will there be fun.” Zhong Ziya’s hand that held the sword glowed brightly. The Primordial Immortal Sword and scabbard in his hand slowly lit up before finally turning into a body of light.</p>
<p>“Interesting. Then let me see if you have the qualifications to walk to the end.” Night Thearch took a step forward and Evernight descended on the arena again, turning everything into darkness.</p>
<p>All the humans in the world felt extremely uncomfortable. It was like watching a boring crappy movie in a movie theater. After enduring it for an hour and finally seeing a beautiful woman about to take a bath, the screen suddenly turned black. Only the sound of water splashing could be heard. It was so uncomfortable that it made one want to go crazy.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t feel good either because he couldn’t see what was happening inside.</p>
<p>However, this state didn’t last long. Soon, a point of light appeared on the dark screen. The point of light became brighter and brighter before it lit up the dark area like a volcanic eruption.</p>
<p>In the end, the light was just too powerful. It made it impossible to look straight at it. It was so blinding that one couldn’t even open their eyes.</p>
<p>When the light faded, the cube’s screen finally returned to normal. Ya and Night Thearch’s figures appeared. The two of them looked at each other from afar as though nothing had happened.</p>
<p>“Who won?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I didn’t see anything at all.”</p>
<p>“It’s too terrifying. We can’t even see a battle at that level. If such experts want to slaughter humans, we won’t even have the chance to resist.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Everyone discussed spiritedly as Zhou Wen wore a puzzled look. He didn’t know who had won or lost.</p>
<p>“I hope you can walk to the end.” After Night Thearch said that, he turned around and vanished into the night.</p>
<p>“I will,” Zhong Ziya answered.</p>
<p>The cube’s screen went black before returning to the rankings. Ya remained in first place. Night Thearch didn’t appear on the rankings, so it was obvious that Ya had won again.</p>
<p>After Ya won this time, the Guardians didn’t swarm over to challenge him like before. There wasn’t even one challenger.</p>
<p>This was because the Guardians knew very well that only a Terror grade could defeat a Terror grade. If they were to challenge him again, it wouldn’t be a challenge, but suicide.</p>
<p>There are less than forty hours left on the countdown. If this continues, Ya should have a chance of getting first, right? Zhou Wen muttered to himself.</p>
<p>“It’s impossible for him to obtain first place.” A palm-sized humanoid puppet walked over, but the sound emitted by the puppet belonged to Moon Goddess.</p>
<p>“Why not? He’s already at the Terror grade. Even if he encounters other Terror grades, he should have a good chance of winning, right?” Zhou Wen didn’t know why Moon Goddess was so certain that Zhong Ziya wouldn’t come in first.</p>
<p>“Just as Night Thearch said, it’s impossible for the dimension to let even half a human obtain first place,” Moon Goddess answered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pondered for a moment and said, “If humans obtain first place, it means that no dimensional race can obtain control of Earth for a year. I can understand that. However, Ya can only be considered half human. If he wins, doesn’t it mean that the race of the Guardian that fused with Ya won? Why can’t they accept that?”</p>
<p>“If he is not of our kin, he is sure to have a different mind. It’s the same for dimensional creatures. If Ya finds the strongest Companion Beast in this year, do you think he will hand it over to the dimensional creatures?” Moon Goddess paused before continuing, “Most importantly, that Dimensional Wheel can’t be handed over to a creature with human blood. Otherwise, even if those dimensional experts personally descend, it’s impossible for them to defeat a human with a Dimensional Wheel in this world.”</p>
<p>“The Dimensional Wheel is created by dimensional creatures. Could it be that they can’t deal with it?” Zhou Wen asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>“Who told you that the Dimensional Wheel was created by dimensional creatures?” Moon Goddess asked.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that so?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>“Of course not. The so-called Dimensional Wheel is actually a Companion Beast,” said Moon Goddess.</p>
<p>“Companion Beast? What level is it?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to say what level it is, but the owner of that Companion Beast was the person who had the strongest Guardian in that horrific era. In that era, they fought countless powerful opponents in the world and ultimately obtained first place. That Dimensional Wheel played a role of inestimable proportions.”</p>
<p>Moon Goddess paused for a moment before continuing, “After all, Guardians in that era weren’t as weak as they are now. This is because the Battle of Guardians took a long time. All the Guardians had enough time to become stronger. Furthermore, in that era, the various races of the dimension had just reached an agreement. The regulations weren’t too strict. Many terrifying dimensional creatures descended and secretly controlled the Battle of Guardians. The expert who could defeat all his opponents in that era and stand at the peak of the world was an unimaginably powerful existence.”</p>
<p>“Which era is the horrific era you speak of? Who’s the Guardian who obtained first place? Who’s his contractor?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>“That human’s name is Xuan Yuan. The Guardian’s name is Mystic Thearch,” Moon Goddess answered.</p>
<p>“Xuan Yuan! Could it be Yellow Emperor!? Then, is Chiyou among his opponents?” Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“There was indeed such a person. He was also an existence that was very likely to win first place at that time. His Guardian was the Weapon Lord. I still remember that if Xuan Yuan hadn’t taken the Dimensional Wheel back then, the human who clinched final victory in that horrifying era might have been Chiyou,” Moon Goddess said.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? Didn’t you say that the Dimensional Wheel is Yellow Emperor’s Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen was even more puzzled when he heard that.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Yellow Emperor picked up the Dimensional Wheel Companion Egg, so the Dimensional Wheel naturally became his Companion Beast. However, Chiyou originally had a chance of obtaining the Dimensional Wheel Companion Egg. No, it should be said that the dimensional wheel originally belonged to Chiyou and Weapon Lord,” Moon Goddess said after some thought.</p>

<p>Moon Goddess had been born on the Moon, so she didn’t know much about Earth. All she could see were some of the major things that had happened on Earth. It had to be a sufficiently large commotion for her to see a thing or two.</p>
<p>Just like how the ship had flown out of thin air back then, Moon Goddess could see such a huge matter clearly from the Moon.</p>
<p>Originally, the battle between Chiyou and Yellow Emperor wasn’t enough for the Moon Goddess to observe. However, a huge meteorite had slammed into Earth. If Earth had been hit, most of the creatures would have been wiped out.</p>
<p>Moon Goddess didn’t know what the experts on Earth had done. However, Chiyou had worn the Weapon Lord Armor and destroyed the meteorite.</p>
<p>The Dimensional Wheel Companion Egg had flown out from the shattered meteorite. However, Chiyou and the Weapon Lord were exhausted of their strength after destroying the meteorite. It was picked up by another human and Guardian. They were naturally Yellow Emperor and Mystic Thearch.</p>
<p>There’s actually such a thing! Zhou Wen was taken aback when he heard that. He didn’t know if Moon Goddess was telling the truth.</p>
<p>However, Moon Goddess’ knowledge was very limited. She didn’t say it clearly because there was no such thing as the black cubes in that era. The experts directly fought on Earth. Only when the combat energy exceeded a certain threshold could Moon Goddess observe it.</p>
<p>Moon Goddess had observed the Dimensional Wheel’s energy explosion many times. It was likely the key to Yellow Emperor’s victory.</p>
<p>“That’s not right. Since the Dimensional Wheel is Yellow Emperor’s Companion Beast, it should have died with him. Why did it end up in the hands of the dimensional creatures?” Zhou Wen thought of a terrifying question.</p>
<p>“That’s not something I can know.” The puppet controlled by Moon Goddess shook its head.</p>
<p>As the two of them spoke, the black cube lit up again. Another person issued a challenge, and the person being challenged was still Ya.</p>
<p>To dare challenge at this time, the challenger must be extraordinary. They must be at the Terror grade, right? Zhou Wen looked at the challenger’s name.</p>
<p>However, the name was very unfamiliar. It was a Guardian named Cave Era.</p>
<p>Not long after, Zhong Ziya accepted the challenge and appeared in the cube’s arena again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully sized up Cave Era that had entered the arena. He saw a human wearing gray armor. The armor covered her entire body, so he could only tell that it was a woman’s figure. However, he didn’t know what kind of human she was or what she looked like. He didn’t know if she was young or old.</p>
<p>“Is this a former Guardian?” Zhou Wen asked the Moon Goddess puppet.</p>
<p>In recent years, very few Guardians had advanced to the Terror grade. As long as they were at the Terror grade, there was a high chance that they were former Guardians who had survived.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Moon Goddess’s answer left Zhou Wen somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya didn’t care who his opponent was. He immediately entered his Terror form and transformed into a beam of light that slashed at Cave Era.</p>
<p>Cave Era’s figure vanished in front of everyone as though she was invisible.</p>
<p>She’s indeed a Terror grade! Zhou Wen wasn’t too surprised. It would be strange if the person who dared to challenge Ya wasn’t at the Terror grade.</p>
<p>After Cave Era vanished, the only thing that could be seen in the arena was Ya, who was like a dazzling light. One could see the light constantly flashing. Ya was probably constantly attacking. He was likely capable of seeing Cave Era.</p>
<p>“Ya is in danger,” Moon Goddess said.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown. He couldn’t see the battle clearly.</p>
<p>“See for yourself.” Moon Goddess didn’t answer directly.</p>
<p>“Would I be asking you if I could see it?” Zhou Wen said gloomily.</p>
<p>“You’ll be able to see it very soon,” Moon Goddess said with a hint at what she felt deep down.</p>
<p>Indeed, before long, Zhou Wen realized that the shadow that represented Ya was gradually slowing down. Not only that, but even his Terror form was becoming somewhat unstable.</p>
<p>After a while, Ya couldn’t maintain his Terror form and revealed himself.</p>
<p>Furthermore, his body looked a little odd. The body under the robe looked much thinner and more hunched. Although his appearance couldn’t be seen, his body didn’t give off the feeling of a young and strong youth. Instead, he looked like an old man on the brink of death.</p>
<p>Temporal power! Zhou Wen immediately knew what had happened. The power of Cave Era was time.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya had been affected by powers like Time Acceleration. Guardians wouldn’t die and weren’t afraid of the passage of time. However, Zhong Ziya wasn’t a pure Guardian. Half of him had a human bloodline and he had a limit to his lifespan. He would still age.</p>
<p>“There’s still a chance of survival if he admits defeat now. Otherwise, he will die of old age in the arena. Unfortunately, he has a betting contract. Admitting defeat will also lead to death,” said Moon Goddess with a sigh.</p>
<p>What kind of contract is a betting contract? Zhou Wen could roughly guess the rules of the bet, but he still wanted to know the details.</p>
<p>“A typical Guardian contract is an equal contract. Both parties can terminate the contract at any time without paying any price. However, a betting contract is different, especially in a situation like Ya’s. His strength isn’t enough to absorb such a powerful Guardian, so he can only agree to sign a betting contract with the Guardian. If he can win the betting contract, he can always have this body. However, if he loses, I’m afraid this body will only benefit others in the end,” Moon Goddess said.</p>
<p>“Just now, he said that he’s betting on whether he can obtain first place. In other words, he has no way out now. He has to win?” Zhou Wen frowned slightly.</p>
<p>“His body has already aged. I’m afraid there’s no chance of him winning,” said Moon Goddess.</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t be that simple,” Zhou Wen said as he stared at Ya.</p>
<p>“He can’t withstand the passage of time, nor can he touch Cave Era who possesses the ability of Time Acceleration. I can’t think of a way for him to turn the tides of defeat.” The Moon Goddess puppet looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Do you know what other abilities he has to help him turn the tables?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what abilities he has, but a person like him shouldn’t be so helpless,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>However, the scene Zhou Wen was hoping for didn’t happen. As time passed, Ya’s body died and he collapsed to the ground. As time passed too quickly, Ya’s body turned to dust.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Cave Era’s figure appeared again. She glanced at the scattered dust on the ground, but her expression suddenly changed. She immediately entered her Terror form.</p>
<p>As for the dust that scattered on the ground, it gathered together again and returned to Ya’s appearance. Furthermore, there was no sign of age on his body.</p>
<p>“Do you only realize it now? It’s too late,” Ya said as he extended his palm. A strange light rune shimmered in his palm.</p>
<p>At the spot where Cave Era had vanished, the same light rune shimmered. It immediately pulled Cave Era’s body over, and she charged uncontrollably into Ya’s palm.</p>
<p>Despite using several powers in a row, she was unable to escape Ya’s power. Even though time slowed down, Cave Era still flew towards Ya’s palm.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1079'>Chapter 1079: Perfection</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen stood up as he watched Cave Era admit defeat and leave the cube’s arena.</p>
<p>“Are you leaving?” the Moon Goddess puppet asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I have to return eventually.” Zhou Wen was somewhat nervous.</p>
<p>It was almost certain that Glimmer would advance to a Perfect Body, but Zhou Wen didn’t know if Glimmer’s advancement to a Perfect Body could advance him to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to hatch the Companion Beast I gave you?” the Moon Goddess puppet asked.</p>
<p>“In the future, I don’t feel like doing it now.” Zhou Wen tidied up his things and confirmed that he hadn’t missed anything. He temporarily stored Jade Rabbit and Ice Maiden in the Chaos Bead before waving goodbye to Moon Goddess.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Zhou Wen switched to the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art and used the Glimmer Life Soul to choose Earth as a teleportation target in the pocket universe.</p>
<p>His body instantly tore through the void. In the blink of an eye, Zhou Wen realized that he had returned to Earth and was standing in a desert.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, the Glimmer Life Soul erupted with immense energy and rapidly transformed. The pocket universe in his body seemed to be activated as it automatically circulated.</p>
<p>In the originally empty desert, there was a baffling amount of energy. The energy was like countless meteors shooting from the sky to the ground.</p>
<p>This gave Zhou Wen a fright. This was because the meteors looked terrifying. Even if there were hundreds of Earths, they would probably be instantly destroyed.</p>
<p>However, that didn’t happen. When the meteors hit Earth, they passed through it without hitting it. It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>The meteor that struck Zhou Wen fused into his body and into his pocket universe, making it stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>Finally, the Glimmer Life Soul completed its final evolution and became a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to observe what the Glimmer Life Soul had evolved into. The Lost Immortal Sutra in his body automatically circulated.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed. Although the Lost Immortal Sutra automatically circulated, this was the first time it had automatically switched back while he was simulating other Essence Energy Arts.</p>
<p>Could it be that… I’m really about to advance to the Mythical stage? Zhou Wen felt expectant and uneasy.</p>
<p>His Slaughterer Life Soul automatically activated as it hugged Zhou Wen’s body as though it had fused with him. Endless Essence Energy surged crazily.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, who was looking forward to advancing to the Mythical stage, suddenly realized that another Essence Energy Art was circulating in his body.</p>
<p>Ancient Sovereign Sutra… How can this be… The Lost Immortal Sutra is still circulating without switching. Why is the Ancient Sovereign Sutra circulating at the same time? Won’t there be a conflict? Zhou Wen was alarmed, but he realized that he couldn’t stop the Essence Energy in his body from circulating.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>He didn’t know what was happening, nor did he know if it was a blessing or a curse.</p>
<p>In theory, it was very dangerous for two different Essence Energy Arts to circulate in one body. Now that the Lost Immortal Sutra and the Ancient Sovereign Sutra were circulating at the same time, Zhou Wen’s body definitely couldn’t withstand the clash of Essence Energy. The chances of him exploding to his death were as high as 99.99%.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was feeling uneasy, the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra began circulating.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Small Perfection of Wisdom. All the Essence Energy Arts that Zhou Wen had cultivated began circulating.</p>
<p>Unlike the usual switching of Essence Energy Arts, the Essence Energy Arts were circulating at the same time. The Ancient Sovereign Sutra, Small Perfection of Wisdom, Dao Sutra, Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping, First Order of Chaos, Qi Refinement Art, Godfiend Era, and Demon God Bloodline Catalog were all circulating in Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed and afraid. Others who cultivated two Essence Energy Arts at the same time would most likely die.</p>
<p>With the nine Essence Energy Arts coming together, it was equivalent to having his name registered with the King of Hell. Zhou Wen found it unbelievable that he wouldn’t die.</p>
<p>However, the nine Essence Energy Arts circulated in Zhou Wen’s body without any conflict.</p>
<p>This feeling was magical. The circulation path of the nine Essence Energy Arts had many conflicts, but for some reason, other than the Lost Immortal Sutra, the eight Essence Energy Arts felt like they were circulating in the void.</p>
<p>The eight Essence Energy Arts seemed to circulate in Zhou Wen’s body, but they also didn’t seem to be in his body. They were closely connected to his body, but they weren’t completely attached to his body.</p>
<p>This magical experience had the eight Essence Energy Arts circulate under the support of Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy. If not for the Lost Immortal Sutra providing unlimited Essence Energy, it would be impossible for him to circulate all eight Essence Energy Arts at the same time.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>As the eight Essence Energy Arts circulated, all sorts of Life Providences and Life Souls automatically activated.</p>
<p>What was even stranger was that the Life Providences and Life Souls had separated from Zhou Wen’s body, forming independent entities. Eight Life Souls that had fused with the Life Providences appeared in eight different directions around Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Primordial Human Sovereign was the shadow of a sovereign; the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder was a book; the Supreme Hell King was Zhou Wen himself; the New Era was a ring with a clown symbol; the Chaos Egg was an egg; the Sword Pill was still in the form of a pill—it hadn’t changed into a sword; the Demon God Bloodline Catalog was a blood shadow. The blood shadow’s outline looked like Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Finally, there was a constantly changing point. It looked like a point, but inside, there seemed to be countless stars circulating as they constantly changed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that it was likely the Perfect Body Life Soul evolved by Glimmer. He didn’t even have the time to look at its name.</p>
<p>These Life Souls were originally condensed by Zhou Wen. Although he had used a simulation method, they still had a blood connection with him when he used them.</p>
<p>But now, the eight Life Souls were unfamiliar and terrifying. Zhou Wen couldn’t sense the connection that he should have with them. It was as though they weren’t the Life Souls and Life Providences that Zhou Wen had condensed himself.</p>
<p>They clearly enjoyed Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy, but they didn’t belong to him. This feeling left him so depressed that he nearly vomited blood.</p>
<p>The only Life Soul that was connected to Zhou Wen’s bloodline was Slaughterer. At the same time, Slaughterer emitted a terrifying killing intent that affected Zhou Wen’s mind.</p>
<p>If not for Zhou Wen’s extraordinary willpower, he would have long been controlled by the killing intent and turned into a lunatic who only knew how to kill.</p>
<p>Hum!</p>
<p>At that moment, the eight Life Souls erupted with terrifying power. Zhou Wen was extremely familiar with the powers. He had used most of them countless times.</p>
<p>However, this time, the powers didn’t help Zhou Wen, but became his enemy.</p>
<p>The sword hum was like a song as the three thousand sword intents fused into one pill. The Sword Pill carried the supreme will of the Sword Dao as it slashed at Zhou Wen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1080'>Chapter 1080: Annihilation</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t think that the sword intent was terrifying when he had used Sword Pill in the past, but now that Sword Pill had become an enemy, he realized how terrifying the sword intent was from personal experience.</p>
<p>Under the suppression of the terrifying sword intent, Slaughterer’s killing intent erupted. Zhou Wen didn’t plan on taking action, but his body was driven by Slaughterer’s power. It was as though he was being hugged by someone behind him as he guided his attacks step by step.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. Wasn’t he hitting himself? It wasn’t easy for him to condense the Sword Pill Life Soul and its corresponding Life Providence. It would be a pity if it was crippled.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The sword beam clashed head-on with Slaughterer’s strength. Sword Pill tore through the Essence Energy and stabbed Zhou Wen’s palm at high speeds like a hot knife through butter.</p>
<p>However, the closer Sword Pill got to Zhou Wen’s palm, the slower it became. The Essence Energy resistance it encountered increased. When it was a few centimeters away from Zhou Wen’s palm, its forward speed was nearly reduced to zero.</p>
<p>Hum!</p>
<p>At that moment, Sword Pill suddenly changed. Its body transformed into a sword that broke through Slaughterer’s Essence Energy barrier. The blade pierced through Zhou Wen’s palm.</p>
<p>Damn it. I’ll be the first person in history to be injured by my Life Soul, right? Zhou Wen knew that he couldn’t hesitate any longer. He wanted to cooperate with Slaughterer and fight seriously.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter if it was condensed by him. If he wanted to live, he had to destroy it first.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to pull out the Sword Pill that had penetrated his palm, the blood shadow condensed by the Demon God Body attacked Zhou Wen from the other side. With a flash, it appeared behind him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned around and brandished his fist. Just as he was about to strike the Demon God Body, the blood shadow that looked like Zhou Wen transformed into a blood snake that wrapped around Zhou Wen’s arm and bit at his neck.</p>
<p>Screw you. Zhou Wen made a prompt decision and headbutted the blood snake’s head.</p>
<p>However, the blood snake changed again. It flapped its wings and transformed into a blood bird, dodging Zhou Wen’s head strike. Its claws left several bloody marks on Zhou Wen’s scalp, injuring his skull.</p>
<p>The Primordial Human Sovereign and Supreme Hell King also attacked from both sides. One fist carried a brilliant divine light while the other carried invisible karmic sinflames.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used his left hand to pull out the Sword Pill that had penetrated his right hand. He quickly moved, hoping to dodge the attacks of the Primordial Human Sovereign and the Supreme Hell King. At the same time, he wanted to summon his Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>However, the Companion Beasts didn’t react at all. Even Demonic Neonate didn’t answer his calls.</p>
<p>Two streams of light flashed and appeared in front of Zhou Wen out of thin air. He had just dodged the attacks of Primordial Human Sovereign and Supreme Hell King, so it was already difficult for him to afford any new strength. Furthermore, the two streams of light appeared out of thin air as though they were teleporting.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only do his best to contort his body. With his excellent reaction speed and calm mind, he dodged the two streams of light that appeared out of nowhere in front of his chest and the back of his head. He wasn’t hit by the fatal attack.</p>
<p>At that instant, the two streams of light vanished again, but Zhou Wen could clearly see that one of the streams of light was the New Era Ring Life Soul. The other was the Perfect Life Soul that Glimmer had just evolved.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s figure moved at high speeds as he took the opportunity to deliver a punch at Supreme Hell King. He wanted to kill one first, but he was surrounded by eight Life Souls and couldn’t use Companion Beasts. This left him overwhelmed.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen’s fist struck Supreme Hell King, it didn’t hit its corporeal body. The palm seemed to pass through space and enter purgatory. The palm inside Supreme Hell King’s body was instantly enveloped by flames. In the flames, the flesh on the palm quickly disintegrated.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly retracted his hand, but the injury couldn’t be healed.</p>
<p>Do you really think I’m easily defeated? Zhou Wen was infuriated. He used Transcendent Flying Immortal and the Heart Defying Sword. As his figure moved like an illusion, sword beams crisscrossed.</p>
<p>A huge ball rolled over. It was none other than the Chaos Egg. When Zhou Wen’s sword beam slashed at the Chaos Egg, it was instantly absorbed like water that had encountered a sponge.</p>
<p>In the past, when Zhou Wen had used these Life Souls to restrain others, he had felt extremely comfortable, but now, he realized how uncomfortable it was to be besieged by these Life Souls.</p>
<p>The easiest thing for humans to ignore was what they already had.</p>
<p>Only when he became enemies with his Life Souls did Zhou Wen seem to realize his Life Souls for what they were worth. It wasn’t that Zhou Wen didn’t understand them in the past, but that he couldn’t see it from this angle.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>In the past, Zhou Wen could use their characteristics, but he never knew how it felt to be attacked by the power of these Life Souls.</p>
<p>Apart from the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder remaining motionless, the other seven Life Souls surrounded Zhou Wen as though they wanted to kill him.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had pushed his technique and strength to their peak, he was still at a disadvantage in a one-on-seven situation. He was constantly injured by his Life Souls, making the situation rather terrible.</p>
<p>The injuries on his body made Zhou Wen increasingly calm. Slaughterer’s strength gradually fused with Zhou Wen. With the augmentation of infinite Essence Energy, Zhou Wen’s strength grew stronger.</p>
<p>If I can condense you, I’ll naturally be able to destroy you. Zhou Wen’s eyes were calm. Slaughterer seemed to have fused with his body as a whole, no longer hugging his sole Life Soul.</p>
<p>Seeing Sword Pill fly over again, Zhou Wen used his finger as a sword and stabbed at it.</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy already had the power of Immortal Slaying.</p>
<p>Pitting sword against sword, Zhou Wen’s sword aura and sword intent were stronger than Sword Pill. When the sword beams collided, Sword Pill’s sword aura instantly shattered. Even the sword body shattered.</p>
<p>The demon beast transformed from the Demon God Body had already pounced behind Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen didn’t turn his head or dodge. Instead, he rapidly retreated and slammed into the demon beast.</p>
<p>Terrifying Essence Energy directly shattered the demon beast formed by the Demon God Body, turning it into specks of splattering blood.</p>
<p>He suddenly extended his left hand and grabbed at his ear. The New Era Ring that he had teleported out of was caught between his fingers before it was crushed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s every move contained the terrifying power of Immortal Slaying. Together with his strength and the augmentation of Slaughterer, he slaughtered his former Life Souls.</p>
<p>One Life Soul after another that once belonged to him was shattered by him. Sword Pill, New Era, Demon God Body, Supreme Hell King, Primordial Human Sovereign, Singularity, and even the Chaos Egg with the strongest defense were cleaved into two by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Apart from the immense power of Immortal Slaying, there was another important reason. Zhou Wen knew them too well.</p>
<p>No Life Soul could withstand a single strike from him. Once upon a time, he would have been enervated once he used the power of Immortal Slaying, but now, he could use it freely without weakening himself.</p>
<p>Only the final Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder remained floating there. The other Life Souls that Zhou Wen had painstakingly condensed shattered into dust.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder with a calm expression. He raised his palm and slashed down like a blade.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1081'>Chapter 1081: No More Friends</h3>

<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>After Cave Era was defeated, no Guardian challenged Ya again. Time ticked by until there was only one second left before another Guardian challenged Ya.</p>
<p>“Indeed, they won’t let Ya, a half-human, obtain first place so easily.” Zhang Chunqiu looked at the cube and sighed.</p>
<p>“Even the Cave Era with the power of time was defeated. Are there any Guardians with powers stronger than time?” Zhang Yuzhi asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu smiled and said, “Time is indeed a very powerful attribute. In theory, time and space should be considered top-notch strength among all the various attributes. However, at that realm, the suppression between attributes isn’t the most important. The strength of a skill is also no longer an important criterion to determine one’s combat strength.”</p>
<p>“Then how do we determine who’s stronger and who’s weaker?” Zhang Yuzhi asked.</p>
<p>“It depends on whose willpower is stronger, whose intelligence is deeper, and whose in-combat improvisation is better. At that stage, there are only weak people, and no such thing as weak abilities. Any ability, even if it looks weak, can become the key to victory as long as it’s used properly.” Zhang Chunqiu paused before adding, “Of course, this is when the difference in strength isn’t too disparate. If the difference in strength is too great, it will be a different matter. However, Ya’s strength and ability should be considered top-notch on Earth. It’s unlikely that there’s a force on Earth that has absolute suppressive might on him.”</p>
<p>“Why can’t it appear? Didn’t you say that there’s the stronger Calamity grade above the Terror grade?” Zhang Yuzhi still wore a puzzled expression.</p>
<p>“The Calamity grade can naturally crush the Terror grade, but in a place like Earth, there are only two possibilities for a Calamity-grade creature to appear. The first is the descent of a Calamity-grade powerhouse from the dimension. However, the dimension’s Calamity-grade powerhouse will be restricted by the rules of Earth after its descent. It’s impossible for them to unleash the strength of the Calamity grade. If they forcefully use their Calamity-grade strength, they might even be reduced to the Mythical stage by the rules.”</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu thought before continuing, “There’s another possibility. After a Guardian contracts a human, they can use the bodies of humans to advance to the Calamity grade. Too little time has been given to the Guardians born in this era. Let alone advancing to the Calamity grade, there aren’t even many at the Terror grade. Therefore, if a Calamity-grade creature appears on Earth, the only possibility is that it is from the Calamity-grade Guardians that survived the previous war.”</p>
<p>“Like the one in our Fiend Tomb?” Zhang Yuzhi asked.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu didn’t answer and continued, “However, although the Guardians who survived the battle are extremely powerful, the humans who contracted them can’t live that long. After leaving the humans, their strength will once again be suppressed by the rules of Earth. Even if they have the strength of the Calamity grade, it’s impossible for them to use it on Earth unless they contract humans again.”</p>
<p>“There are so many humans on Earth. It shouldn’t be difficult to find a contractor, right?” Zhang Yuzhi said after some thought.</p>
<p>“It’s not that easy. There is some kind of restriction. Do you think the one in our family doesn’t want to come out?” Zhang Chunqiu smiled and said, “In short, it looks like Ya still has a chance. As long as he can survive the next challenge from the dimension, he might very well become the final victor.”</p>
<p>“Brother, do you wish for Ya to win or for him to lose?” Zhang Yuzhi blinked and asked.</p>
<p>“From my standpoint, I hope he wins, but his chances aren’t high,” Zhang Chunqiu answered.</p>
<p>The person challenging Ya was a Guardian named Jiuyue. It was a very unfamiliar name. He had never appeared on the rankings before, so no one knew what abilities he had.</p>
<p>After the battle began, people immediately knew what ability he had because the characteristics of his ability were too obvious.</p>
<p>Teleportation—constant teleportation. Ya’s continuous attacks failed to touch any part of Jiuyue’s clothes.</p>
<p>However, Jiuyue had no intention of counterattacking. If Ya attacked, he would teleport and dodge. If Ya didn’t attack, he wouldn’t move either. Instead of calling it a battle, it looked more like he was stalling for time.</p>
<p>Ya didn’t launch any meaningless attacks as he took on his Terror form. His body transformed into a beam of light, but Jiuyue could also enter the Terror form. After doing so, he vanished even more thoroughly than Ya.</p>
<p>However, the Terror-form Jiuyue still had no intention of counterattacking. He continued dodging. Now, anyone could tell that Jiuyue was stalling for time. They just didn’t understand why he was stalling.</p>
<p>“What does Jiuyue want? If he wants to expend Ya’s Essence Energy, that shouldn’t be right. The Essence Energy he expends when teleporting is much more than Ya,” Xia Xuanyue said in thought as she looked at the cube’s screen.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan looked at the screen and frowned. “I have an ominous feeling. I’m afraid this battle for first place won’t end so easily.”</p>
<p>“Why do you say that?” Xia Xuanyue asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. It’s just a hunch.” Xia Liuchuan shook his head slightly, but his expression was solemn.</p>
<p>Just as Xia Xuanyue had said, Jiuyue was constantly teleporting in his Terror form, and the expenditure was much greater than Ya’s. If he continued fighting, Ya would definitely win.</p>
<p>However, Ya didn’t continue attacking. He stopped and left his Terror form. He sat down in the arena and placed Primordial Immortal Sword on his lap.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you fighting?” Jiuyue had also left his Terror form as he looked at Ya and asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Don’t you need time to prepare to deal with me? I’ll give you time,” Ya said indifferently.</p>
<p>Jiuyue looked at Ya with a complicated expression. “You know that I need time to deal with you. Why don’t you defeat me as soon as possible? If you are fast enough, you might be able to avoid a lot of trouble.”</p>
<p>“What will be, will be. Besides, I’m not afraid of trouble,” Ya said.</p>
<p>“No regrets?” Jiuyue asked Ya.</p>
<p>“Life isn’t about regret, but about doing what you want to do,” Ya answered.</p>
<p>Jiuyue looked at Ya and sighed. “If I had met you earlier, we might have become friends.”</p>
<p>“We won’t become friends. I stopped making friends long ago,” Ya said.</p>
<p>“Why?” Jiuyue asked Ya in a daze.</p>
<p>“Because I only have one life. I can’t give it all to them when there are too many friends,” Ya answered.</p>
<p>Jiuyue didn’t say a word when he heard that. He only looked at Ya silently. After a moment, Jiuyue said, “If you attack now, you still have a chance if you can defeat me in fifteen minutes.”</p>
<p>Ya had no intention of moving. He continued sitting there with his eyes closed. Jiuyue looked at him and asked, “Do you think I’m lying to you?”</p>
<p>“No, I believe you are telling the truth,” Ya said with certainty.</p>
<p>“Then why aren’t you fighting?” Jiuyue asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Because I don’t want to be your friend, I won’t take anything that belongs to you,” Ya said.</p>
<p>Jiuyue looked at Ya with a strange look in his eyes. After a while, he wanted to say something, but his expression suddenly changed. He looked into the void and sighed. “It’s too late now.”</p>
<p>In the void, a beam descended, illuminating the entire cube’s arena.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1082'>Chapter 1082: The Symbol on the Wheel of Destiny</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>At the instant he shattered the Heaven-Opening Scripture, Zhou Wen felt his body undergo a strange change.</p>
<p>The mysterious Sigh of the Life Providence King automatically circulated. Slaughterer that had fused with Zhou Wen’s body still emitted terrifying killing intent and Essence Energy. It was even more terrifying than when he fought the eight Life Souls.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Wen’s essence, vitality, and spirit, they erupted like a volcano.</p>
<p>The energy produced by the three forces was unimaginable.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen countless Mythical creatures. Apart from Demonic Neonate, who had the ability to undergo Terror transformation at the Mythical stage, all sorts of powerful Mythical creatures, such as Torch Dragon and Tyrant Behemoth, could produce powers that weren’t as terrifying as the ones Zhou Wen had unleashed.</p>
<p>Under the direction of such a terrifying force, Zhou Wen felt his body constantly transform.</p>
<p>This transformation was different from any other in the past. The previous transformations were within Zhou Wen’s limits, but this time, the energy produced by the evolution was no longer something his body could withstand.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the evolution, Zhou Wen was very worried that his body would explode because he couldn’t withstand the power.</p>
<p>In fact, it was indeed the case. In an instant, countless cracks appeared on Zhou Wen’s body like an eggshell that was about to shatter.</p>
<p>At this moment of life and death, the terrifying force surged towards a spot.</p>
<p>It was a point, a point that seemed to be in a superposition of existence and non-existence. It was like the beginning of the universe, but also the end of the world.</p>
<p>That point seemed to be a real existence, but it also seemed to only exist in his consciousness.</p>
<p>Between reality and illusion, it was difficult to even determine its existence. However, when the terrifying power injected into the point, it gradually became clearer.</p>
<p>It constantly spun and changed, and it became more and more corporeal. However, this corporealization was very abstract. It didn’t really exist in reality, as though it was just Zhou Wen’s imagination.</p>
<p>Gradually, the point grew bigger and brighter, turning from a point into a wheel.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Furthermore, there were many strange, changing patterns on the wheel.</p>
<p>The patterns were abstract. Sometimes, Zhou Wen felt that the patterns resembled him, and sometimes, they resembled Slaughterer. Sometimes, they resembled the Life Souls that had been destroyed by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>There were moments when the patterns resembled Primordial Human Sovereign, New Era, and Supreme Hell King. However, upon careful inspection, it didn’t seem like it.</p>
<p>It was difficult to describe the patterns accurately.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Wen couldn’t tell what shape the wheel was. Although it could be described as a disk, it only had one face. It had a spherical arc.</p>
<p>If it was described as a sphere, from a certain angle it looked sunken. It was like a coin that was constantly spinning and changing.</p>
<p>Is this the Wheel of Destiny? Zhou Wen could sense that the Wheel of Destiny was inextricably linked to him. It was like a part of his body, as important as organs like his brain and heart.</p>
<p>However, it was different from the organs that grew on its body. It existed independently.</p>
<p>What will my Wheel of Destiny be? Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength isn’t bad. Dragon Eclipse’s Bright Torch Vision World is the strongest, but those don’t seem to have anything to do with me… Zhou Wen didn’t know what his Wheel of Destiny would be.</p>
<p>This was because he didn’t have any reference. Perhaps he was the first human to rely on his own strength to advance to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>The three forces constantly surged into the Wheel of Destiny that was taking shape, but even the Wheel of Destiny couldn’t seem to withstand such a powerful force.</p>
<p>In particular, the energy that gushed out from the Sigh of the King was endless like a galaxy or the universe itself.</p>
<p>The energy that seeped out of the Wheel of Destiny seeped into Zhou Wen’s flesh and blood. Under the impact of the energy, his transformed flesh and blood seemed to undergo an inexplicable change.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and the Wheel of Destiny were constantly transforming, especially the patterns on the Wheel of Destiny. The changes seemed to slow down as some of the lines stopped moving.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen inexplicably knew that his Wheel of Destiny was about to condense. This was the most critical moment.</p>
<p>What kind of power is it? If I can choose, I hope that the power of the Wheel of Destiny is related to spacetime. Zhou Wen felt that the power of spacetime was easier to understand the world’s origins.</p>
<p>To figure out the relationship between the dimension and Earth, perhaps spatial-temporal power was a good entry point.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t see any patterns related to spacetime on the Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>On the Wheel of Destiny that had condensed, many of the lines had already solidified. The lines looked a little messy, but he still couldn’t figure it out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried to figure out some patterns from it, but in reality, there was no pattern to the lines. They were everywhere, as though they were random scribbles.</p>
<p>Most of them were curves with almost no straight lines.</p>
<p>Ah! When most of the lines took form, Zhou Wen finally saw what symbol it was. At the same time, he was alarmed.</p>
<p>It was a painting. It was a portrait of a woman, but it only showed her side profile. He couldn’t see her entire face. The portrait was complete, and just the incomplete side profile was already breathtakingly beautiful.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>However, this wasn’t the reason for Zhou Wen’s horror. What truly alarmed him was that he was too f*cking familiar with this woman’s avatar.</p>
<p>This was the woman’s portrait on the anchor. He couldn’t be wrong. Zhou Wen had seen it too many times and had thought about it too many times. Apart from the lack of an anchor, this was the woman’s portrait.</p>
<p>As more and more lines were fixed, it proved Zhou Wen’s guess. It was indeed identical to the portrait of the anchor woman he had seen. Apart from not having an anchor, it was identical.</p>
<p>Why… Why would that woman’s symbol appear on my Wheel of Destiny… Countless thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind.</p>
<p>Just as the woman’s portrait was about to be completed with only a few strokes left, Zhou Wen suddenly felt extremely uncomfortable.</p>
<p>That’s my Wheel of Destiny. Why is there a woman on it? Zhou Wen felt an inexplicable emotion. This emotion seemed to infect the Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>When the woman’s portrait was just short of the last stroke, the Wheel of Destiny suddenly lit up. The rapidly spinning Wheel of Destiny suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>In the next moment, the Wheel of Destiny moved again. However, it was different from before. It was actually spinning in reverse.</p>
<p>Following the reversal of the Wheel of Destiny, the portrait of the woman engraved on the Wheel of Destiny was disappearing bit by bit.</p>
<p>For some reason, even though he didn’t know what the outcome would be, Zhou Wen felt an inexplicable sense of satisfaction.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1083'>Chapter 1083: No Engravings</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The patterns on the Wheel of Destiny decreased bit by bit, and at that moment, the Sigh of the King’s power suddenly surged out even more crazily.</p>
<p>Unlike how it was helping the Wheel of Destiny’s rotation previously, the Sigh of the King’s power was now trying to prevent the Wheel of Destiny from spinning in reverse.</p>
<p>The Sigh of the King was unimaginably powerful. The Wheel of Destiny, which was rapidly spinning in reverse, immediately slowed down as though the emergency brake had been hit.</p>
<p>The Wheel of Destiny didn’t completely stop reversing. It was still spinning slowly like a clock’s second hand. Every tick produced a click.</p>
<p>This sound wasn’t the tick of the second hand, but the cracking sounds of the Wheel of Destiny as it continued spinning in defiance of the Sigh of the King’s terrifying power.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>The Wheel of Destiny spun forcefully. After a few rotations, several cracks appeared on its body. If this continued, the entire Wheel of Destiny would probably shatter.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt his lifeblood boil as though his body was about to be torn apart.</p>
<p>He knew very well that if the Wheel of Destiny shattered now, not only would his advancement to the Mythical stage fail, but he would also be reduced to the Epic stage. It was even possible that his body would be severely injured. It was difficult to say if he would be able to reach the Mythical stage again.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t stop the Wheel of Destiny from circulating. He had long known that his Life Providence was different from the average person’s Life Providence.</p>
<p>The Sigh of the King far exceeded the power an ordinary Life Providence should have. Mythical creatures could be killed with a single thought. The various deities in the temple didn’t dare to receive his bow. After all, the creatures in the temples were very likely existences at the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Just as Moon Goddess had said, his Life Providence shouldn’t have been like this. It was because of some external influence that it had formed such a Life Providence.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the external force that affected him was the metal plate that recorded the Lost Immortal Sutra. The existence that whispered in Zhou Wen’s ear like a female ghost had only appeared after he obtained the metal plate. From then on, it had left a huge impact on Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally believed that he had completely resolved this problem after he advanced to the Epic stage.</p>
<p>However, from the looks of it, this problem hadn’t been resolved. It was still affecting him. Otherwise, how could that woman’s portrait appear on his Wheel of Destiny?</p>
<p>Could the woman drawn on the anchor be the same person as the owner of the Lost Immortal Sutra? Zhou Wen guessed.</p>
<p>The Wheel of Destiny was still spinning in reverse, but the Sigh of the King was just too powerful. If the Wheel of Destiny continued spinning in reverse, there would only be one outcome—the Wheel of Destiny would definitely shatter.</p>
<p>Despite knowing this outcome, Zhou Wen had no intention of stopping it.</p>
<p>Perhaps it had something to do with how Zhou Wen had lived alone from an early age. From the moment he could register memories, he had basically lived alone. He had decided what he should and shouldn’t do. Even Zhou Lingfeng hadn’t forced him to do anything.</p>
<p>Now that the Sigh of the King’s power had forcefully interfered with the formation of his Wheel of Destiny, coupled with Zhou Wen’s understanding of the Sigh of the King, Zhou Wen firmly supported the Wheel of Destiny’s reversal. This was because his personal feelings wouldn’t lie. When the Wheel of Destiny reversed, the comfortable feeling made him make a decision.</p>
<p>Even if the Wheel of Destiny shattered, wasting the past two years, and even if he had to start over again, he would definitely not compromise. He would not let the Sigh of the King control his Wheel of Destiny and decide how he was to proceed in the future.</p>
<p>My path can only be decided by myself. Zhou Wen watched the Wheel of Destiny constantly crack. It wasn’t done on impulse, nor would he feel any regret. He was extremely calm.</p>
<p>He was still young. As long as he was still alive, he still had the capital to start all over again. If he didn’t stay true to himself, was he going to regret it when he was old?</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>As though sensing Zhou Wen’s beliefs, the Wheel of Destiny spun even more intensely. However, every spin was at the cost of its own destruction.</p>
<p>Seeing that the Wheel of Destiny was about to shatter into pieces, the Sigh of the King’s forceful control of the power on the Wheel of Destiny began to recede.</p>
<p>The Wheel of Destiny finally regained its freedom as it spun faster. The woman’s portrait was also erased bit by bit.</p>
<p>The damaged Wheel of Destiny continued absorbing energy and repairing the damaged wheel. When the last line of the woman’s portrait was erased, the Wheel of Destiny had long returned to normal.</p>
<p>At that moment, it stopped moving. Zhou Wen originally imagined that the Wheel of Destiny would spin again before condensing a mark that truly belonged to him.</p>
<p>However, it didn’t happen. After the Wheel of Destiny stopped circulating, the power that erupted caused Zhou Wen’s body to undergo a mutation. Zhou Wen clearly felt his stats increase—it was no longer limited by 41 points.</p>
<p>I’ve advanced to the Mythical stage? But why isn’t there anything on my Wheel of Destiny? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed as he hurriedly checked his phone. He wanted to take a careful look at his stats to see what abilities the unmarked Wheel of Destiny had.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was connected to the Wheel of Destiny by blood, so he could sense that it had power. However, the power was strange, preventing him from completely comprehending its profundity.</p>
<p>He switched on his phone and dripped a drop of blood on it. A few notifications immediately popped up on the phone’s home screen.</p>
<p>‘Advanced to the Mythical stage. Bloodline function activated.</p>
<p>‘Advanced to the Mythical stage. Samsara function activated.’</p>
<p>‘Advanced to the Mythical stage. Birth function activated.’</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was dumbstruck when he saw this. The first two were fine. Although he didn’t know what they were for, he would eventually find out in the future.</p>
<p>But what the hell is this Birth function? Could it be that he couldn’t have children before advancing to the Mythical stage? Did he need a phone to decide whether he could have children?</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to study the new functions of the phone. All he wanted to know was what his Wheel of Destiny was.</p>
<p>Opening the blood-colored avatar’s stats, the blood-colored avatar’s latest information entered Zhou Wen’s eyes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen: Mythical</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Life Providence: Sigh of the King</p>
<p>Life Soul: Slaughterer</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: No Engravings (One Spin)</p>
<p>Strength: 42</p>
<p>Speed: 42</p>
<p>Constitution: 42</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 42</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully looked at his various stats a few times. It was within his expectations to break through his limits. He still needed to absorb the various stat crystals to raise his strength to the level of a true Mythical creature.</p>
<p>Slaughterer didn’t have the mark of a Perfect Body, not because it had weakened, but because with Zhou Wen’s advancement, his Life Soul already had the strength of a Mythical.</p>
<p>The Sigh of the King remained the same. It didn’t change at all. After preventing the Wheel of Destiny to no avail, there was nothing from it.</p>
<p>There were no changes to the various rare stats. The rare stats required him to absorb the stat crystals himself. They wouldn’t automatically increase just because he had advanced to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Finally, it was Zhou Wen’s Wheel of Destiny. Ignoring what kind of ability No Engravings was, just One Spin annotation left Zhou Wen alarmed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had only seen the words “One Spin” on Demonic Neonate’s Wheel of Destiny before, but Demonic Neonate’s Wheel of Destiny was called One Spin. And on his Wheel of Destiny, One Spin seemed to be a unit.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1084'>Chapter 1084: A Mountain</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>No Engravings: Destiny when unengraved, has not come to an end.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the annotation of his Wheel of Destiny and was still confused. He still didn’t know what his Wheel of Destiny’s ability was.</p>
<p>Without even looking at where he was, Zhou Wen entered the game, hoping to see what use the Wheel of Destiny had in actual combat.</p>
<p>At the same time, he could farm some Mythical dimensional crystals and raise his stats. Otherwise, he would be at a disadvantage facing a Mythical creature.</p>
<p>He entered Deer Terrace Pavilion, where there were the most Mythical creatures on the third floor. Although they weren’t strong, it was a good place to farm Mythical dimensional crystals.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>He first tried using the Chi he had encountered on the way, but it left Zhou Wen puzzled. After the Wheel of Destiny was activated, it immediately began circulating.</p>
<p>However, nothing happened. There was no augmentation of attributes, no powerful offensive strength, or any special changes.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Zhou Wen was extremely depressed. He now suspected that something had happened to his Wheel of Destiny because of the reversal. He hadn’t obtained an ability that the Wheel of Destiny should have.</p>
<p>He rushed all the way to the underground sea, but the nine Demon Blood True Dragons hadn’t respawned. Zhou Wen was about to rush past the area when his gaze swept across the sapphire-like sky, he couldn’t help but be stunned.</p>
<p>Approaching the sapphire sky spelled death. After observing it several times, Zhou Wen failed to discover the secret within.</p>
<p>However, when he looked at the sapphire sky, he realized that there was a massive creature inside.</p>
<p>The creature was so huge that it was comparable to a dragon. It could be seen in every corner of the underground sea, but Zhou Wen had never seen such a huge creature before.</p>
<p>Have I always been blind in the past? Zhou Wen immediately rejected this thought and became ecstatic.</p>
<p>He wasn’t blind in the past, so there were only two possibilities why he hadn’t seen the massive creature in the sapphire sky.</p>
<p>One possibility was that the creature was capable of invisibility. Another possibility was that the creature was at the Terror grade, so Zhou Wen couldn’t see it.</p>
<p>The first possibility wasn’t high. If it was invisible, there should have been other methods to sense its existence. However, Zhou Wen had used many methods in the past, but he had failed to discover it. Now, things were clearly abnormal that he could suddenly see it.</p>
<p>I can see creatures in their Terror form? Zhou Wen’s first reaction was to summon Demonic Neonate and let her enter her Terror state.</p>
<p>Indeed, I can see it! Zhou Wen looked at Demonic Neonate and nearly jumped up in joy.</p>
<p>In the past, when Demonic Neonate transformed into her Terror form, Zhou Wen had seen nothing but air. Now, Zhou Wen could see her clearly.</p>
<p>He realized that Demonic Neonate’s body had indeed changed significantly. However, he hadn’t seen her in the past, so he didn’t know what Demonic Neonate looked like after her Terror transformation.</p>
<p>After Demonic Neonate transformed into her Terror form, the demonic aura on her body was variable. She was like a devil, transforming into all sorts of terrifying shadows as though she could devour anyone at any moment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Demonic Neonate didn’t change much herself. She was still wearing an ink-purple armor. She held the Demonic Sword in her arms and a bell hung at her waist. She stood there coldly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stopped circulating the Wheel of Destiny. Demonic Neonate immediately vanished from his eyes as though she had turned invisible.</p>
<p>Could it be that the power of my Wheel of Destiny allows me to see creatures that have turned into their Terror form? This seems a little weak… But it can’t really be considered weak either… Zhou Wen felt that this ability wasn’t bad.</p>
<p>There were two key reasons why the Terror grade was powerful. One was that only the power of the Terror grade could injure a Terror grade. Therefore, no matter how strong a Mythical grade was, it was almost impossible to defeat the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Even if the stats between both parties weren’t too different, the Terror grade was invincible among Mythical creatures.</p>
<p>This wasn’t something that couldn’t be resolved. Zhou Wen had the Ice Dragon King’s Terror item. By using it as a weapon, he could injure Terror-grade creatures. This had been confirmed when used on Night Thearch.</p>
<p>The other terrifying thing about the Terror grade was that most people couldn’t see them. The unknown would deepen one’s fear, making it impossible for ordinary creatures to fight a Terror-grade creature. They could only be tortured to death.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t absolute. For example, the Terror transformation of the Jade Rabbit didn’t make it invisible to others. Instead, it just gigantified.</p>
<p>However, this type of Terror-grade creature was relatively rare. Most Terror-grade creatures had Terror forms that couldn’t be seen.</p>
<p>Now Zhou Wen could see Terror-grade creatures and had something that could injure Terror-grade creatures. These two points had greatly increased his strength.</p>
<p>In the future, when he faced Terror-grade creatures again, he wouldn’t be at such a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, my Wheel of Destiny seems rather useful. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and realized that it was indeed very useful. However, he still felt that it didn’t have all the abilities of No Engravings.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen did some more experiments, but he didn’t discover any other abilities.</p>
<p>Knowing that such matters couldn’t be rushed, Zhou Wen decided to cross the underground sea and let Demonic Neonate enter Deer Terrace Pavilion. He killed the fake fairies and immortals and cleared the three-story building. Finally, a 59-valued Strength Crystal and 62-valued Essence Energy Crystal dropped.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>He directly refined and absorbed them, and the two stats instantly increased.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t continue farming because he didn’t know where he was.</p>
<p>The teleportation ability of Glimmer was a long-distance interstellar teleportation. It could only teleport to a designated planet, but its precision was insufficient.</p>
<p>Now that he was in a desert, Zhou Wen had no idea where he was.</p>
<p>In the past, with Glimmer and New Era, it wasn’t difficult to get his bearings. However, Zhou Wen had shattered all his Life Providences and Life Souls, so he naturally didn’t have his prior abilities.</p>
<p>He tried switching Essence Energy Arts and realized that there was no reaction. It was as though he had never cultivated them before.</p>
<p>Are all the Essence Energy Arts I took so long to cultivate crippled just like that? Zhou Wen shook his head slightly. Forget it. I need to figure out where I am first.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried his best to expand Truth Listener’s range to figure out where he was, but all Truth Listener could hear was a desert.</p>
<p>Only in the distance in front of Zhou Wen was a mountain. The mountain was somewhat strange. In the endless desert, there wasn’t a single cactus or water source, but the mountain was filled with greenery and vitality.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sized it up for a while and didn’t walk towards the mountain. Instead, he summoned the Earth Elemental Beast and got it to tunnel in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>There was definitely something amiss. Although Zhou Wen was powerful, he didn’t dare barge into mysterious places without the protection of the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder.</p>
<p>However, when the Earth Elemental Beast tunneled hundreds of kilometers away, Zhou Wen was alarmed to discover that he had already arrived at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1085'>Chapter 1085: Paradise Mountain</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen looked up and saw a monument standing in front of the mountain. On it were the words “Paradise Mountain.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately knew where he was.</p>
<p>Back when he followed Liu Yun to the Taklamakan Desert, Liu Yun had once told him that there were four extremely terrifying dimensional zones in the desert: Death Valley, Netherworld City, the Endless Sea of Stars, and Paradise Mountain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already been to Netherworld City and the Endless Sea of Stars. He had heard of Paradise Mountain, but he never expected to see it when he teleported back.</p>
<p>Since he couldn’t leave, Zhou Wen decided not to. He released Ice Maiden and Jade Rabbit and carried Demonic Neonate as he carefully sized up the Paradise Mountain stone monument.</p>
<p>Beneath the stone monument was a tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>It’s a free dungeon. It’s a waste not to take it. Zhou Wen took out his phone and snapped a picture of the tiny palm symbol. He immediately entered the download screen.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>According to Liu Yun, no one who enters Paradise Mountain can come out alive. I wonder what’s so special about this mountain? Now that there’s no Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, it’s not easy to barge in. It’s best I wait until the game is downloaded before exploring in-game. Just as Zhou Wen was thinking, he heard a sweet voice coming from Paradise Mountain.</p>
<p>Looking up, he saw a group of bikini beauties laughing and playing. Their beautiful legs made him dizzy.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sat outside the mountain and watched the beauties play. His body seemed to have an uncontrollable urge to go over. Thankfully, his will was firm. With a thought, he made the urge disappear.</p>
<p>He circulated the Wheel of Destiny and looked at the beauties. His pupils immediately constricted.</p>
<p>They weren’t beauties at all. They were just huge, ugly and evil gray rats.</p>
<p>What was even stranger was that the gray rats stood like humans. They wore gray cloaks and their eyes swirled with an evil light.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, Zhou Wen summoned the Bronze Sparrow Sword. The flaming blade tore out of its scabbard and flew into Paradise Mountain, instantly killing a few evil gray-robed rats.</p>
<p>This stirred up the rats’ nest. A large number of gray-robed rats crawled out of the mountain forest of Paradise Mountain. Their eyes lit up as they formed a massive psyche force field. The more gray-robed rats there were, the stronger the psyche force field.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood why no one returned from Paradise Mountain alive.</p>
<p>These gray-robed rats were good at psyche attacks. Furthermore, they could gather their psyche powers together. It was similar to the combined attack of the Musical Note Sprites.</p>
<p>However, these gray-robed rats were even more terrifying. Psyche attacks were difficult to defend against, and these were all at the Epic stage. Furthermore, there were many of them. Even Mythical creatures would easily be lost in their minds if they suffered their psyche attacks.</p>
<p>In the beginning, the Bronze Sparrow Sword wasn’t affected. It continued slaughtering the gray-robed rats, igniting flames everywhere on Paradise Mountain.</p>
<p>However, when thirteen red-clothed rats appeared on Paradise Mountain, the Bronze Sparrow Sword was also affected. Not only did it stop killing, but it also turned to attack Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, thirteen Mythical rats. This Paradise Mountain is a force to be reckoned with. Don’t tell me there are still Terror-grade existences? Zhou Wen felt a huge mental pressure as he thought to himself.</p>
<p>However, his willpower was extremely tenacious to begin with. Now that he had the Wheel of Destiny, he could see the true bodies of the rats. No matter what, he wouldn’t be fooled. He extended his hand and grabbed the Bronze Sparrow Sword that was in a state of betrayal.</p>
<p>However, the rats’ psyche strength was quite powerful. Countless Epic gray-robed rats and the thirteen red-robed rats exerted their strength together. Even the Terror-grade Jade Rabbit was affected.</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit’s eyes were replaced with red hearts as it slowly walked towards Paradise Mountain.</p>
<p>“Wake it up.” Zhou Wen felt embarrassed for Jade Rabbit. It was at the Terror grade after all, but it had been bewitched by a mischief of rats.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden summoned a huge block of ice and smashed it onto Jade Rabbit’s head. The ice shattered into pieces before Jade Rabbit woke up.</p>
<p>Although the Jade Rabbit is a pure Strength-type Companion Beast and its mental strength isn’t its specialty, it’s still at the Terror grade. To be able to affect it, these rats’ psyche skills are no trifling matter. Zhou Wen saw that Ice Maiden seemed to have the ability to restrain such psyche skills, so he got her to ascend Paradise Mountain and kill the rats first.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden wasn’t in the mood to play with these rats. After her Terror transformation, an ice explosion blasted most of the gray-robed rats into ice shards.</p>
<p>About eight of the thirteen red-robed rats died. A few were also injured.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw the dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs on the ground, he hurriedly summoned a group of Musical Note Sprites and got them to pick up the dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>Seeing that the remaining red-robed rats were about to escape, Ice Maiden waved her hand. Cold air surged out and froze them into ice sculptures.</p>
<p>When Ice Maiden saw that the rats were dead and was about to return, she suddenly heard an ear-piercing shriek coming from the top of Paradise Mountain.</p>
<p>“Squeak!” The voice was extremely sharp. Ice Maiden’s expression changed slightly when she heard the voice. Icy light erupted from her body, as if she was resisting some terrifying power.</p>
<p>The Musical Note Sprites that Zhou Wen had sent into Paradise Mountain seemed to have lost their souls as they floated towards the mountaintop.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood outside Paradise Mountain and felt his mind go adrift. He almost walked into Paradise Mountain.</p>
<p>Thankfully, his willpower was too strong. He was only slightly dazed before he immediately recovered.</p>
<p>The Jade Rabbit fell into a trance again as Zhou Wen stored it into the Chaos Bead. Zhou Wen originally imagined that he couldn’t use the Chaos Bead without the First Order of Chaos, but he realized that his Essence Energy could still activate the Chaos Bead without any problems.</p>
<p>This made Zhou Wen suspect that it wasn’t that the Essence Energy Arts were unusable. They were, for some reason, temporarily unusable.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden’s eyes narrowed as she charged toward the top of Paradise Mountain. Soon, a terrifying collision sounded.</p>
<p>Seeing that there weren’t many rats left on Paradise Mountain, Zhou Wen decided to walk in himself. He planned on picking up the dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>He especially wanted the dimensional crystals. Zhou Wen happened to need to build up his stats. The thirteen red-robed rats had dropped five stat crystals and a Companion Egg. It was perfect.</p>
<p>Even a Mythical creature couldn’t withstand the psyche influence from the mountaintop, but Zhou Wen could still maintain self-control. After walking into Paradise Mountain, he picked up the stat crystals and absorbed them without any hesitation, allowing his stats to rapidly increase.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen picked up the Companion Egg, he saw a stream of light slash down from the mountaintop. It was an ancient sword.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen hadn’t been able to see the power of the Terror grade, he probably would have died. He would have been slain by the ancient sword.</p>

<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The Demonic Sword automatically unsheathed itself and blocked the ancient sword.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s surprise, the Demonic Sword failed to gain the upper hand in the clash with the ancient sword. It looked like they were evenly matched.</p>
<p>One had to know that not only was the Demonic Neonate terrifying, but it also had Grim Demon’s power inside. Grim Demon was already extremely powerful at the Terror grade. With such an augmentation, it only managed to fight the ancient sword to a draw. The ancient sword’s strength was shocking.</p>
<p>Out of Death Valley, Netherworld City, the Endless Sea of Stars, and Paradise Mountain, I’ve already entered Netherworld City and the Endless Sea of Stars. Netherworld City has some extreme horror in it. It’s impossible to see the real Netherworld City unless all the punishments are experienced. The Endless Sea of Stars also has terrifying existences like the Planet Devourer. Now, there’s actually such a powerful creature in Paradise Mountain. As it fights Ice Maiden, it can also use an ancient sword to fight the Demonic Sword. The four mysterious dimensional zones in the desert really aren’t simple. Zhou Wen stood there watching the battle in his Galaxy Shell Dragon armor. The shockwave from the battle between the two swords hit Zhou Wen, causing him to retreat uncontrollably. His feet left two deep grooves in the ground.</p>
<p>Amidst this impact, Zhou Wen discovered a strange phenomenon.</p>
<p>Under the impact of the terrifying sword beam, Zhou Wen realized that marks had appeared on his Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally thought that the Wheel of Destiny had been injured by a Terror-grade power, or that the injuries from reversing the Wheel of Destiny hadn’t completely healed. He believed that these cracks were a result of the powerful collision.</p>
<p>However, he soon realized that this wasn’t the case. This was because Zhou Wen could sense sword intent amidst the cracks that gradually appeared. It was a familiar yet unfamiliar sword intent.</p>
<p>Three thousand sword intents… Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>The sword intent was clearly the three thousand sword intents, but it was different from his three thousand sword intents. It was even more powerful and terrifying. It was a true Mythical sword intent.</p>
<p>The power of the Sword Pill is still around… Then, are the other Life Providences and Life Soul powers also around? Zhou Wen looked at the cracks on the Wheel of Destiny and realized that the cracks were swords. All the swords pointed out and condensed into the shape of the Sword Pill.</p>
<p>When the Sword Pill had completely formed on the Wheel of Destiny, Zhou Wen immediately felt an uncontrollable terrifying sword intent erupt from the Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>The sword intent was like an emperor ruling over the world. At the same time, a powerful sword aura erupted from the Life Wheel.</p>
<p>The ancient sword seemed to be affected by Zhou Wen’s sword intent as it abandoned the Demonic Sword. With a resplendent and terrifying sword aura, it streaked across the sky and instantly arrived in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt the sword aura in his body fill up, nearly causing his body to explode. He couldn’t help but extend his hand and use his index and middle fingers as swords to stab out.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A sword beam tore out of his finger and condensed into the Sword Pill that collided straight-on with the ancient sword.</p>
<p>The Sword Pill was shattered by the ancient sword, but the ancient sword was also deflected by the Sword Pill’s force. It deviated from its original trajectory and flew past Zhou Wen’s cheek.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised. The Sword Pill and the Qi Refinement cultivator’s abilities still existed. However, the way they existed was different from before. They were even stronger.</p>
<p>If they were a simulation in the past, they had now fused into Zhou Wen’s body and become an instinct, not a simulated skill.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could rejoice, he suddenly realized that the Sword Pill inscriptions on the Wheel of Destiny were rapidly disappearing. Soon, they vanished, preventing Zhou Wen from using its power.</p>
<p>Without the lure of the sword intent, the ancient sword was no longer interested in Zhou Wen. After being caught up by the Demonic Sword, it continued fighting.</p>
<p>What’s going on? The Wheel of Destiny had clearly engraved the Sword Pill and obtained the unique skill of the Wheel of Destiny. Why is it gone again? Zhou Wen frowned in thought as he carefully recalled what had happened. He immediately had some ideas.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen focused and calmed his mind as he recalled his insights from cultivating the Qi Refinement Art and his understanding of Sword Pill.</p>
<p>He engraved his Wheel of Destiny with his mind. Indeed, as his thoughts and large amounts of Essence Energy surged in, patterns appeared on the Wheel of Destiny again.</p>
<p>Finally, the engravings transformed into the shape of the Sword Pill. However, this Sword Pill’s appearance was somewhat different from before. This was a Sword Pill that Zhou Wen had drawn according to his understanding, making it somewhat different from before.</p>
<p>Drawing the Sword Pill consumed a large amount of Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy, but with Slaughterer’s help, the Essence Energy expenditure wasn’t a problem.</p>
<p>Once the Sword Pill was formed, the supercilious sword intent appeared and attracted the ancient sword’s attention again. Seeing the ancient sword slash at him again, Zhou Wen stabbed out with the Sword Pill once more.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen was in an even worse state. He was sent flying as he rolled down Paradise Mountain like a ball.</p>
<p>However, Sword Pill still managed to withstand the ancient sword’s strike. Despite it shattering, Zhou Wen wasn’t injured.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen had expected, the moment the Sword Pill shattered, the marks on the Wheel of Destiny vanished.</p>
<p>My Wheel of Destiny is called No Engravings. It’s very difficult to leave a mark on it. Even if it’s engraved, it’s only temporary and can’t exist for long… In other words, even with the Wheel of Destiny’s ability, it’s only temporary. Every time I use one, I have to engrave it myself… However, in that case… Since I can engrave Sword Pill… Can I also engrave other Life Souls? Zhou Wen felt mixed emotions.</p>
<p>Although he had finally discovered a way to use the Wheel of Destiny, this method was a little strange. Every time he used it, he had to engrave it himself. If it was a sudden battle, how would he have the time?</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen soon thought of something that made him so excited that he immediately wanted to verify it.</p>
<p>In the past, he couldn’t circulate two Essence Energy Arts at the same time, so he couldn’t use two Life Providences and two Life Souls at the same time. But now, it was different.</p>
<p>If the abilities of those Essence Energy Arts had already become his instinct, could he carve out two Life Wheel patterns at the same time and use two or more abilities?</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen immediately used his mind to draw on the Wheel of Destiny again. This time, he wasn’t drawing the Sword Pill, but Primordial Human Sovereign.</p>
<p>He wanted to see if he could draw another Life Wheel symbol or if he could only draw Sword Pill.</p>
<p>The outcome delighted Zhou Wen greatly. As he inscribed his understanding and insights of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra, he indeed drew a pattern that resembled the Primordial Human Sovereign on the Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>The reason it was only a resemblance was because the Life Wheel symbol wasn’t the Primordial Human Sovereign from before, but an upgraded version. It was a true Mythical power.</p>
<p>As the Ancient Sovereign symbols appeared on the Wheel of Destiny, a shadow appeared in front of Zhou Wen. Without a doubt, it was the upgraded Primordial Human Sovereign.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1087'>Chapter 1087: Can’t Last Long Enough</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen suppressed the excitement in his heart and continued carving on the blank spot on the Wheel of Destiny. This time, he was carving the Sword Pill.</p>
<p>The Sword Pill was also engraved on the Wheel of Destiny bit by bit. As for the Ancient Sovereign symbol on the other side, it didn’t disappear. When the Sword Pill symbol was completed, the Sword Pill tore out of his fingers again, Zhou Wen nearly moaned in bliss.</p>
<p>Looking at the coexisting Sword Pill and Ancient Sovereign, Zhou Wen felt that Lady Luck hadn’t abandoned him.</p>
<p>Thank you, Holy Mother, Jade Emperor, God of Fortune… Just as Zhou Wen was feeling excited, the Ancient Sovereign shadow suddenly vanished. It turned out that the Ancient Sovereign symbol on the Wheel of Destiny was disappearing. It was no longer complete.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen gloomily realize that even if he didn’t fight, the marks on the Wheel of Destiny would quickly vanish.</p>
<p>The name ‘No Engravings’ sure is apt. I really can’t engrave anything on it. Zhou Wen was somewhat helpless. Although he gained the possibility of using multiple abilities at the same time, the Wheel of Destiny’s characteristics were too odd, making things a little troublesome.</p>
<p>Is there any way to permanently preserve the engravings? Zhou Wen felt that he should spend some time studying it in the future. Even if it only lasted a little longer, it would be a huge improvement for him.</p>
<p>Grim Demon fought the ancient sword and Ice Maiden fought the unknown creature on the mountaintop, but Zhou Wen was having fun drawing at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>After various tests, Zhou Wen confirmed that he could draw the eight Life Souls. Furthermore, as long as his insights were different, what he drew would be different every time.</p>
<p>The deeper Zhou Wen’s insights were, the stronger the Wheel of Destiny patterns he drew and the longer they could stay on. They would be stronger as well.</p>
<p>The only thing Zhou Wen couldn’t draw was the marks that the Lost Immortal Sutra should have. This was because he knew the least about it. The Lost Immortal Sutra didn’t need him to comprehend it or cultivate it. It would automatically circulate. As long as his stats reached a certain level, he could directly advance.</p>
<p>It was clearly the foundation of Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy Art, but the one he knew the least about.</p>
<p>If I can carve the Lost Immortal Sutra on the Wheel of Destiny one day, will those marks disappear again? A thought flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind.</p>
<p>There was no answer, but Zhou Wen had found a direction to make himself stronger. The deeper his understanding of Essence Energy Arts, the longer the marks left on the Wheel of Destiny would last. Perhaps one day, when he was strong enough, the marks would exist forever.</p>
<p>After figuring out the situation, Zhou Wen placed his attention on the battle on Paradise Mountain. The Demonic Sword and ancient sword were still engaged in battle, with no victor determined.</p>
<p>On the mountaintop, Ice Maiden seemed to be gradually falling into a disadvantage. Zhou Wen circulated the Wheel of Destiny and carved out the Heaven-Opening Scripture before flying to a spot closer to the mountaintop.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen saw the creature that was fighting Ice Maiden. It was also a ratman, but the ratman looked more like a human than the gray-robed and red-robed rats.</p>
<p>It was dressed in a white suit with golden-framed glasses on its face and a white top hat decorated with black lines on its head. It looked very strange.</p>
<p>What the hell is this? Zhou Wen was alarmed. This was the first time he had seen such a dimensional creature.</p>
<p>What was even stranger was that not only did the ratman possess powerful psyche skills, but its movement technique was also extremely strange. It was as fleeting as smoke. In its hand was a gun.</p>
<p>It was in the shape of a revolver. It looked a little like a Smith & Wesson 500, but it was bigger and had a thicker barrel. Most of the gun was silver-white metal in color, and a small portion had gray patterns. It had an indescribable beauty.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden could withstand the ratman’s psyche attacks, but the revolver caused her a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>She seemed to be afraid of the bullets in the gun and didn’t dare to be hit by them. She would dodge every time, putting her at a disadvantage. It looked like it was going to be very difficult for her to persist.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t tell what kind of power was in the bullet. Although he could tell that it was at the Terror grade, the bullet was too fast. His vision couldn’t keep up.</p>
<p>“Ice Maiden, come back.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he summoned Banana Fairy. At the same time, he quickly retreated and left the Paradise Mountain area.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder had already vanished from his Life Wheel. Secondly, Banana Fairy’s attacks didn’t differentiate between friend and foe. It would be a hindrance if he stayed there.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden knew how powerful Banana Fairy was. Even Grim Demon was left in a tragic state from her winds. She wouldn’t fare better.</p>
<p>The strange ratman didn’t know how powerful Banana Fairy was. When it saw a beautiful fairy floating over with a banana leaf, it raised the revolver and shot Banana Fairy three times.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy pouted and blew out a gust of Supreme Yin Wind.</p>
<p>Just like the bullets in The Matrix, the three bullets suddenly slowed down. Zhou Wen finally saw them clearly.</p>
<p>The bullet head looked like it was made of crystal, but its appearance was somewhat strange. It was like a miniature ghost, looking extremely sinister.</p>
<p>Not only did the three bullets slow down, but frost even formed on them. In the blink of an eye, they were thrown back in the wind.</p>
<p>The strange-looking ratman was also blown away. As there were no obstructions nearby, the ratman and bullets were sent flying. They flew into the distance with the yellow sand and quickly vanished.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>I wonder if the ratman is dead? Zhou Wen watched as it was blown away. He didn’t even know where to pick up the dimensional crystal if there was one.</p>
<p>Even if it really was dead, the dimensional crystal might have already been taken away by other creatures by the time he rushed over.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The ancient sword that was fighting the Demonic Sword suddenly lost control and fell from the sky, landing on the ground. Furthermore, it was no longer in its Terror form.</p>
<p>Eh, this sword isn’t a dimensional creature? Zhou Wen immediately realized that there was something wrong with the ancient sword.</p>
<p>If the ancient sword was a dimensional creature, being able to fight the Demonic Sword for so long was a little shocking, but it was still acceptable.</p>
<p>However, if it was only a weapon that was controlled by the ratman, it would be abnormal for it to fight the Demonic Sword for so long. After all, the ratman didn’t seem to be that strong.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked closer and looked at the ancient sword that had fallen to the ground. He hadn’t looked at it carefully before, but now that he was carefully sizing it up, he realized that it was indeed somewhat odd.</p>
<p>It looked like it wasn’t made of gold, jade, iron, or steel. Furthermore, it didn’t seem to have a sharp edge. It looked like it was sheathed in a scabbard, but there was no opening to the scabbard. It looked like it was one.</p>
<p>The ancient sword remained motionless on the ground. He was certain that the ratman had been controlling it previously. Now, he didn’t know if the ratman was too far away from it or if it was already dead. In any case, the sword was no longer under its control.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully sized up the ancient sword and saw that there were words engraved on the hilt. When he looked at it, his eyes widened as his pupils constricted like needles.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1088'>Chapter 1088: Substitute Fighter</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>On the hilt of the sword, the words “Immortal Culling” were engraved.</p>
<p>Is this thing for real? Zhou Wen widened his eyes as he looked at the ancient sword. He found it unbelievable that it was the real Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>If one were to look at the two words “Immortal Culling” alone, they weren’t anything impressive. They were even a little tacky. However, if one added the word “sword” behind the two words, it would be a little terrifying.</p>
<p>If there were three swords beside this sword—Immortal Vanquishing, Immortal Entrapment, and Immortal Peril—it would be even more terrifying.</p>
<p>The legendary Four Swords of Immortal Vanquishing were a terrifying existence that had truly killed all immortals and fiends. They were the most powerful Dharma treasure of the legendary Sect Master.</p>
<p>It was difficult to describe how powerful the four swords were. In comparison, an existence like the Nine-Tailed Fox in Chess Mountain was no different from a chicken waiting to be slaughtered in front of the real Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>Any one of the powerful existences that the four swords had killed could defeat the Nine-Tailed Fox.</p>
<p>Ignoring the four swords, just any one of them would probably make Zhou Wen invincible on Earth if he could completely master them.</p>
<p>Of course, the premise was that this sword was really the Immortal Culling Sword. This ancient sword might only share the same name as the legendary one.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare take the risk. He summoned Tyrant Behemoth and got it to pick up the sword.</p>
<p>Immortal Culling Sword didn’t react at all. Tyrant Behemoth brandished it twice, but it didn’t discover any special energy fluctuations. It didn’t have the same might as before.</p>
<p>How did that ratman control it? With a thought, Zhou Wen summoned the Earth Elemental Beast and chased after the ratman with Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether this sword was the real Immortal Culling Sword or not, it possessed rather powerful strength. If he could figure out how to control it, it would be of great help.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy’s fan had blown the ratman far away. Zhou Wen followed the huge trail left by the wind and ran for hundreds of kilometers before he finally lost track of the trail. However, he didn’t see the strange ratman either.</p>
<p>It’s not dead? Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to search the vicinity, but he didn’t find any traces of the ratman. He wanted to return to Paradise Mountain.</p>
<p>However, after walking for a long time, he couldn’t even see Paradise Mountain. It was as if it had vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that it would probably be very difficult to find Paradise Mountain again. All he could do was switch on his phone. He had successfully downloaded the Paradise Mountain dungeon and entered it in-game.</p>
<p>There were many gray-robed rats in-game, so Zhou Wen had a great time killing them.</p>
<p>Soon, thirteen red-robed rats appeared. Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to waste time with them. He got Demonic Neonate to release the Demonic Sword and killed them.</p>
<p>A few dimensional crystals dropped. After Zhou Wen absorbed the dimensional crystals, his Strength reached 67, his Speed reached 71, his Constitution reached 54, and his Essence Energy reached 70.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s mind was still on the strange ratman. Without carefully looking at his stats, he led Demonic Neonate up the mountain.</p>
<p>What puzzled Zhou Wen was that he didn’t see the strange ratman atop Paradise Mountain.</p>
<p>There was a hole at the top of the mountain. It was the size of a bowl, but when he looked inside, it was bottomless, as though there was no end.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the Earth Elemental Beast to go down, but after crawling for a long time, it failed to reach the bottom. It was as though there was no bottom.</p>
<p>How strange. What’s going on? Zhou Wen knew that there was definitely something wrong with the hole. Otherwise, with the Earth Elemental Beast’s speed, it would have probably crawled to the other side of Earth in half a day.</p>
<p>He thought of all sorts of solutions and even got Banana Fairy to inject wind in. However, the terrifying Supreme Yin Wind vanished without a trace. He had no idea how deep the hole was.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to take the Immortal Culling Sword with him. He planned on returning to Luoyang first.</p>
<p>Along the way, Zhou Wen grinded all sorts of Mythical creatures in-game. He planned on raising his stats. After all, having a powerful body was the foundation. He would have an advantage in battle.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>On the cube’s arena, a white beam descended from the sky. In the white beam was a faint shadow.</p>
<p>After the light descended, it landed on Jiuyue’s body and vanished in a flash.</p>
<p>“What was that?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t see it clearly. Is it a Companion Beast summoned by Jiuyue?”</p>
<p>“Some kind of skill?”</p>
<p>Everyone discussed spiritedly. They were momentarily unsure what it was.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya looked at Jiuyue and frowned.</p>
<p>Jiuyue’s pupils turned white. Although nothing else had changed, his aura was clearly different.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Zhong Ziya asked Jiuyue.</p>
<p>“You aren’t worthy of knowing my name,” Jiuyue replied indifferently as he looked at Zhong Ziya.</p>
<p>With that said, most people understood what was going on.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, that works? Aren’t those fellows from the dimension too shameless?”</p>
<p>“They aren’t satisfied with a tag-team battle, and are now using substitutes?”</p>
<p>“How f*cking disgusting. Although I don’t like people like Ya, I hate shameless people even more.”</p>
<p>“Ya, kill him.”</p>
<p>The Federation was in a frenzy. Even the devils overseas didn’t look happy.</p>
<p>“They really don’t treat us humans as people,” Uesugi Nao muttered to herself with a cold expression. If she could enter the arena now, she would help him regardless of which faction Ya belonged to.</p>
<p>Many people had the same thoughts as Uesugi Nao, but humans weren’t dimensional creatures. No one could break the rules of the cube.</p>
<p>However, Zhong Ziya didn’t show any emotions. He just said calmly, “Alright. Anyway, I don’t have the habit of remembering the names of losers.”</p>
<p>“Ignorance is also a form of bliss. Cherish your last moments of happiness.” Jiuyue wasn’t angry as he slowly raised his palm.</p>
<p>There was no shocking glow on his palm. With a casual grab, Zhong Ziya, who was thousands of meters away, somehow appeared in front of him and was grabbed by the neck.</p>
<p>It felt as if the space between them had vanished.</p>
<p>Crack! Ya’s neck snapped as his head fell.</p>
<p>However, Ya’s decapitated body exploded into a white fog, turning into a beheaded puppet that fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The spectators broke out into a cold sweat before feeling relieved. Now, most humans hoped that Ya could win.</p>
<p>Jiuyue seemed to have expected this. He grabbed again and Ya, who had just reappeared, appeared in front of him again. The space between the two of them vanished just like that.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>This time, it was Ya’s true body. He raised Primordial Immortal Sword and blocked Jiuyue’s palm, but Jiuyue’s palm grabbed the sword along with his neck, lifting them up together.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1089'>Chapter 1089: The Fool Who Has Lived A Little Longer</h3>

<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhong Ziya’s body suddenly turned into white mist and escaped from Jiuyue’s hand.</p>
<p>Following that, the two of them entered their Terror forms. The average human couldn’t see their figures, so they didn’t know how the battle was proceeding.</p>
<p>However, from the short battle just now, Ya was clearly at a disadvantage. Jiuyue’s spatial powers left a deep impression in the minds of people.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the dimensional creature attached to Jiuyue had a powerful aura. It made people feel that Zhong Ziya wasn’t as powerful as before. It was like a child fighting an adult.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already walked out of the desert and arrived in a city that had been abandoned by humans. When he passed by the cube, he happened to see this scene and stopped to watch the battle.</p>
<p>Others couldn’t see the Terror-grade battle, but when Zhou Wen’s Wheel of Destiny moved, he immediately saw it clearly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat worried. Zhong Ziya’s situation wasn’t good.</p>
<p>As their power attributes weren’t completely the same, there was no way to directly compare the power between the two. However, from the levels, Jiuyue didn’t surpass the Terror grade. It was still at the Terror grade.</p>
<p>However, his usage of spatial powers and his understanding of them had reached a terrifying level. It was far from what the original Jiuyue could compare with. Zhong Ziya was far inferior.</p>
<p>Those fellows from the dimension are really shameless. They actually let a Calamity-grade creature control Jiuyue’s body and power. Although their power levels are the same, his usage and realm are on a much higher level. The Guardian that Zhong Ziya fused with clearly has some spatial powers. His opponent is also a spatial-type, but his opponent’s understanding is deeper than his. His opponent knows Zhong Ziya’s various abilities and knows how to deal with him, but Zhong Ziya knows very little about Jiuyue’s abilities. The difference in information will result in a huge disadvantage. Zhou Wen could tell how Zhong Ziya was in danger.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhong Ziya’s previous battles had exposed too many of his abilities, allowing his opponent to understand him better.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya’s every move seemed to be within Jiuyue’s expectations. The battle was extremely difficult, and the injuries on his body increased.</p>
<p>If not for his various escape techniques and clone abilities, he would have been killed by Jiuyue long before now.</p>
<p>However, the escape technique had its limits. It was impossible for him to have an inexhaustible supply of clones. Zhou Wen could tell that Zhong Ziya’s situation was very bad.</p>
<p>Just as Zhong Ziya escaped, he suffered another heavy blow. The terrifying spatial power tore through his body.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya’s body slammed into the arena and was no longer in his Terror form. His white robe was already dyed red with blood. The wound on his chest almost extended across his entire chest.</p>
<p>He held the hilt of the sword with his blood-stained hand and supported his body. He could barely stand as his body swayed. His wounds were still bleeding. He looked like he was in a bad situation.</p>
<p>“This is unfair!” A young girl clenched her fists and shouted angrily.</p>
<p>There were many people who had the same thoughts as her, but there was nothing they could do. Even if they knew that it was unfair, they were powerless to change anything. There was no fairness in this world.</p>
<p>Jiuyue also dispelled his Terror form. He looked at Zhong Ziya, who was covered in blood, and said, “You were lucky not to die from this strike. You actually didn’t take the opportunity to quit. You really have a death wish.”</p>
<p>With that said, Jiuyue prepared to attack and kill Zhong Ziya.</p>
<p>“You’re at the Calamity grade?” Zhong Ziya asked as he held the hilt of his sword with both hands to support his body so that he wouldn’t collapse.</p>
<p>“At least you aren’t ignorant,” Jiuyue answered.</p>
<p>“The Calamity grade is indeed very strong,” Zhong Ziya continued.</p>
<p>“That’s an unimaginable level for you humans. It’s also a power that you can’t understand. In my eyes, you are no different from an ant. Therefore, don’t try to make an enemy of us. That will only bring about a calamity for you humans,” Jiuyue said matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>“What a pity.” Zhong Ziya suddenly sighed.</p>
<p>“What’s the pity?” Jiuyue asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, you made a mistake,” Zhong Ziya said.</p>
<p>“Oh, what mistake?” Jiuyue looked at Zhong Ziya with interest. To him, Zhong Ziya was like a joke.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t have come here,” Zhong Ziya said seriously.</p>
<p>“Why shouldn’t I be here?” Jiuyue continued asking.</p>
<p>“Killing you at this level is nothing. I want to kill you at the Calamity grade. Therefore, you shouldn’t have come here.” Zhong Ziya was still very serious, showing no intention of joking.</p>
<p>However, Jiuyue laughed as though he had heard an extremely funny joke. “Do you think that you have a chance of killing me just because we are both at the Terror grade? How ignorant are you to have such thoughts? Even if our powers are about the same, our levels and understandings are different. Our actual combat ability is worlds apart. I only need to move my fingers to kill you. It’s useless even if you want to self-destruct. You can’t injure me.”</p>
<p>Jiuyue’s words had a defeating effect, but no one could refute him. Ya was considered almost the best among humans, but in front of the dimensional creature that possessed Jiuyue, he was suppressed to the point of being unable to resist.</p>
<p>Everyone fell silent. They had nowhere to vent their anger.</p>
<p>Ya was the one being humiliated on stage, but Jiuyue’s words were also a form of contempt for the entire human race.</p>
<p>However, Zhong Ziya didn’t reveal any special emotions. He looked at Jiuyue and said, “That’s right. Your realm is very high, and your understanding of power and the laws is far above mine. Unfortunately, you don’t understand humans.”</p>
<p>“Why should I understand humans?” Jiuyue was no longer in the mood to continue talking to Zhong Ziya. He raised his hand and grabbed him. The space between the two vanished without a trace. Zhong Ziya appeared in front of him as though he had offered his neck into his hand.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya, who had his neck clasped by Jiuyue, gradually had a burning look in his eyes. His eyes turned red as he continued, “If you understand humans, you should know that humans are a species that constantly make mistakes and learn. People like you who have a lifespan of ten thousand years and can even live forever wouldn’t understand how good humans are at learning given their lifespans only last decades.”</p>
<p>With that said, Zhong Ziya’s aura suddenly turned domineering. Terrifying Essence Energy erupted like a volcano, blasting away Jiuyue’s hand.</p>
<p>“Unlike you, I wasn’t born ten thousand years ago. Ten thousand years later, you stand before me like a giant.” Zhong Ziya’s aura became more and more terrifying. He had already entered his Terror form and vanished from everyone’s sight. However, his crazy voice still echoed.</p>
<p>“Everything that has been given to you over the past ten thousand years is just a moment of grandeur. The real you is just a fool who has lived a little longer.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1090'>Chapter 1090: Indeed A Fool</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>These words were extremely arrogant, but the humans watching felt zeal and ardor pump through their veins.</p>
<p>“Well said. Nice tirade.” Xia Liuchuan couldn’t help but praise.</p>
<p>“He’s just a fool who has lived a little longer. Haha, what an interesting fellow.” Zhang Chunqiu laughed until his tears were about to fall.</p>
<p>“I suddenly feel that it’s not bad to have such a friend,” Dugu Ge, who had always abided by the mantra ‘silence is golden,’ suddenly said.</p>
<p>“What a pity. He said that he no longer makes friends,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“I’ll treat him as a friend. What does his willingness to make friends have to do with me?” Dugu Ge said expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“That’s… true…” Zhang Chunqiu realized that he couldn’t refute Dugu Ge.</p>
<p>“That’s totally right. I also want to shamelessly acknowledge such an interesting person as a friend,” Xia Liuchuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>As for Jiuyue, he was extremely furious. Instantly, he entered his Terror form and wanted Zhong Ziya dead once and for all.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was feeling extremely uneasy. Zhong Ziya was severely injured, and those injuries were as genuine as can be. It would be too dangerous if he continued fighting.</p>
<p>However, Zhong Ziya had no intention of giving up on the battle. He continued battling Jiuyue.</p>
<p>Yet, although Jiuyue still had the advantage, he wasn’t able to completely suppress Zhong Ziya like before.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya’s combat strength was constantly improving.</p>
<p>No, it shouldn’t be said that it was his combat strength. His power hadn’t become stronger, but his understanding and realm of power had become stronger. He was growing at an unbelievable speed.</p>
<p>“No… Impossible…” Jiuyue almost couldn’t believe that such a thing would happen.</p>
<p>In such a short period of time, Zhong Ziya seemed to have completely understood and absorbed the various abilities and realms he had previously displayed.</p>
<p>The methods he had used previously were no longer effective against Zhong Ziya. Jiuyue had to use new abilities or have a higher understanding of nomological power to continue suppressing Zhong Ziya.</p>
<p>However, once he used it, it was useless to use the same method again against Zhong Ziya. This was because Zhong Ziya already understood the power and realm.</p>
<p>They were both spatial-type and at the Terror grade. The advantage that Jiuyue had was his realm and superior understanding.</p>
<p>Now, this advantage was rapidly being eroded. Jiuyue’s expression finally changed.</p>
<p>Now, he just wanted to kill Zhong Ziya quickly. He did his best and pushed Zhong Ziya’s strength to the limits, leaving wounds on his body.</p>
<p>However, those wounds weren’t fatal. Furthermore, the chances of him injuring Zhong Ziya decreased.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya’s pupils had already turned into a strange red color. They were blood-red, evil and crazy. It made Jiuyue panic.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t have come.” Zhong Ziya was grabbed in front of Jiuyue, but at that moment, Jiuyue didn’t feel any joy from succeeding. Instead, he felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya’s neck was snapped by Jiuyue again, but his beheaded body turned into a puppet.</p>
<p>Jiuyue’s pupils constricted. He had actually failed to tell that it was Zhong Ziya’s clone.</p>
<p>Realizing that something was amiss, he wanted to use space to teleport away, but he realized that Zhong Ziya was already behind him. The blood-stained lips were almost touching his ear. “I’ll chop off your head.”</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Jiuyue felt a huge force behind him as his body involuntarily flew forward.</p>
<p>Jiuyue wanted to extend the distance, but he suddenly realized that his body seemed to be locked in place. He couldn’t extend the space any further. Furthermore, his body had been kicked out from his Terror state.</p>
<p>He felt that he had something on his back, but he couldn’t see it. It was a strange blood-colored curse pattern that was imprinted on his back. It emitted an evil aura.</p>
<p>Jiuyue didn’t have the luxury of time to look at what it was because Zhong Ziya had appeared behind him. He held Primordial Immortal Sword with both hands and slashed at his neck at an unbelievable speed.</p>
<p>As Jiuyue had been kicked out of his Terror form, all the spectators could see this scene.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A beam of light flew out of Jiuyue’s body. Although there was still a chance for him to fight to the death, the dimensional creature didn’t wish to risk its life.</p>
<p>Just as Zhong Ziya had said, his true strength wasn’t limited to what had been showcased. His true strength could easily crush Zhong Ziya to death. He didn’t want to risk his life because of Zhong Ziya.</p>
<p>When the figure of light ascended, it turned around and took a glance. This glance nearly made him vomit blood.</p>
<p>The Primordial Immortal Sword in Zhong Ziya’s hand hung around Jiuyue’s neck. The blade had already reached his skin, but it didn’t slash down.</p>
<p>“This… bastard…” The figure immediately understood.</p>
<p>There was only one possibility for him to hold back his sword and not slash down under such circumstances. Zhong Ziya had never planned on slashing down. Otherwise, with his strength and speed, it would be impossible for him to temporarily hold back his sword. Everything he had done previously was just to scare him.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, Zhong Ziya actually dared to do such a thing. If he had known that this strike was a feint, the figure would have had a chance of killing Zhong Ziya.</p>
<p>However, not only did Zhong Ziya do it, but the figure had also been frightened. It couldn’t tell the truth behind the strike.</p>
<p>“You’re indeed an idiot,” Zhong Ziya muttered as he looked at the figure that flew into the void. He returned his sword to its scabbard.</p>
<p>The figure suddenly shook in the void before instantly disappearing.</p>
<p>“Haha, this person is really interesting.” Xia Liuchuan laughed until he couldn’t straighten his back.</p>
<p>“This isn’t interesting. He’s risking his life. If that dimensional creature saw that his strike was a feint, he would probably be dead by now,” Dugu Ge said solemnly.</p>
<p>“To dare slash out such a strike under such circumstances, this person is either a lunatic or an idiot,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a strange expression as he looked at Zhong Ziya on stage.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t look like a lunatic,” Dugu Ge said.</p>
<p>“That’s why he’s an idiot,” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>“Idiot? That’s good,” Zhang Chunqiu said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>In the arena, Jiuyue regained control of his body. He looked at Zhong Ziya with a complicated expression and didn’t say a word. He only cupped his fists and bowed slightly before admitting defeat and leaving the arena.</p>
<p>“Ya… Ya… Ya…” At that moment, many of the humans who were watching the battle shouted Ya’s name, forgetting the fact that Ya only had half a human bloodline.</p>
<p>Ya stood in the arena. Although his body was covered in blood, he left people in awe. None of the Guardians dared to challenge him again.</p>
<p>There were very few Terror-grade Guardians to begin with. There were even fewer who had Ya’s realm and comprehension. Among the Guardians who were willing to fight, no one had the confidence to defeat him.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Ya was ejected from the cube’s arena. At the same time, his name vanished from the cube’s rankings.</p>
<p>Everyone was taken aback before they suddenly understood what had happened. Instantly, the entire Federation and overseas were in an uproar.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1091'>Chapter 1091: Human</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Holy sh*t, he was kicked out of the rankings just because they can’t win. Can they be any more shameless?”</p>
<p>“Don’t play if you are a sore loser! Why the f*ck are we fighting in the arena? Can’t you just decide on who’s first place?”</p>
<p>“Ya… so pitiful…”</p>
<p>“Screw whatever King of Earth. Ya is the real King of Earth.”</p>
<p>Instantly, the entire Federation and overseas were enraged, but what was the point? Ya was still kicked out of the rankings. It was impossible for him to return to the rankings.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression was nasty. He wasn’t thinking about victory or defeat.</p>
<p>Whether Zhong Ziya could get first or if he had suffered grievances wasn’t important to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, Zhong Ziya had signed a betting contract. If he didn’t get first place, he would have lost the bet. His body would suffer a backlash from the Guardian and he would completely lose himself.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen wished he could immediately find Zhong Ziya and see how he was doing, but he had no idea where Zhong Ziya was.</p>
<p>“Grim Demon, what will happen if you lose after signing a betting contract?” Zhou Wen called Grim Demon out and asked with a cold expression.</p>
<p>Grim Demon replied with some schadenfreude, “A betting contract has a powerful binding effect on both parties. Even a Calamity-grade expert would find it difficult to violate it. I reckon that the kid’s body should already belong to the Guardian of the bet.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing Grim Demon’s words, Zhou Wen knew that there was no hope. Even a Calamity expert couldn’t escape the conditions of a betting contract. Zhong Ziya was most likely doomed.</p>
<p>No matter what, they won’t let humans get first place, right? Zhou Wen looked at the ranking with cold eyes. The anger in his heart was indescribable as he walked towards the cube.</p>
<p>If Zhong Ziya were to be defeated, it would be because he was inferior. However, forcefully kicking him out and taking his life was unacceptable to Zhou Wen. He had nowhere to vent his anger.</p>
<p>When Grim Demon saw Zhou Wen walk towards the cube, he hurriedly chased after him and asked, “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“To participate in the cube ranking battle,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>Grim Demon hurriedly said, “Actually, you don’t have to go. We are one. If I take first place, it’s equivalent to you taking first place. Now that I’m first, I can guarantee that I can definitely secure first place and retrieve the Dimensional Wheel.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally knew that Grim Demon winning meant that he had won. However, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to win in such a manner, nor would he let Grim Demon win.</p>
<p>Although Grim Demon belonged to him, Grim Demon also represented a race in the dimension. Grim Demon’s win also meant that the race had won. This wasn’t what Zhou Wen wanted.</p>
<p>“You are to stay here and wait for my challenge. You decide what to do.” Zhou Wen unsummoned his Companion Beasts, leaving Grim Demon standing there before going up the cube.</p>
<p>As Ya had been kicked out, Grim Demon, who was originally second on the rankings, was first. After Zhou Wen got onto the cube, he injected his Essence Energy into it.</p>
<p>The cube immediately reacted. Among pure humans, only Zhou Wen could activate it.</p>
<p>As Guardians and dimensional creatures had natural names but humans didn’t, his name was blank when the cube did a verification scan. Zhou Wen had to fill it in himself.</p>
<p>“Human.” Zhou Wen only filled in one word.</p>
<p>As there were no other Guardians or Companion Beasts challenging Grim Demon, all the cubes in the world displayed his challenge request and name.</p>
<p>“Human!” All the humans were stunned when they saw this name.</p>
<p>This was because dimensional creatures and Guardians had natural names. Even if humans participated in the battle after contracting Guardians, the cube would only show the Guardian’s name and not the human’s.</p>
<p>And ‘Human’ clearly wasn’t a Guardian’s name.</p>
<p>“It should be a human like Ya, right?” People guessed.</p>
<p>“Even if he’s a human like Ya and as powerful as Ya, I’m afraid it’s useless. He will ultimately be kicked out. Those b*stards in the dimension won’t let humans get first place. Not even half a human can.”</p>
<p>“Just defeating Grim Demon to vent our anger would be nice though.”</p>
<p>“How can it be that simple to defeat Grim Demon? That Grim Demon is definitely at the Terror grade. There might be a chance but only if this person is as powerful as Ya.”</p>
<p>Everyone discussed spiritedly. They basically believed that the challenger was a monster that was half-human and half-Guardian.</p>
<p>In fact, most humans didn’t acknowledge people like Wang Mingyuan and Ya. The reason they had supported Ya previously was partly because Ya was so outstanding and partly because they had no other choice.</p>
<p>Pure humans couldn’t even leave their names on the rankings. They had no chance of supporting them.</p>
<p>As people discussed, Grim Demon accepted the challenge. The scene on the cube’s screen changed to the cube’s arena. Two figures appeared in the cube’s arena.</p>
<p>One of them was naturally Grim Demon. However, most people wanted to know what the fellow who claimed to be “Human” looked like. Although they knew that it was impossible for him to be a pure human, most of them had a sense of affinity towards him for daring to use the name ‘Human.’</p>
<p>However, when they saw the figure, they were stunned.</p>
<p>The figure wore human clothes and looked like a human from head to toe. Apart from a white jade mask on his face, he looked like a human.</p>
<p>“He really looks like a human?”</p>
<p>“It’s impossible for him to be a pure human. He must be half-human like Ya.”</p>
<p>“But there’s no sign of mutation on him at all.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you see him wearing a mask? The mutation part is definitely on his face.”</p>
<p>Everyone was in a flurry of discussion, but Zhou Wen stood there motionless as he looked at Grim Demon with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>The mask on his face was called Moonlit Mask Armor. It was transformed from a Companion Beast, Moonlit Rabbit.</p>
<p>The Moonlit Rabbit Companion Beast was formed from the pearl he had obtained from Moon Goddess. Although it had a Mythical foundation, it was still at the Mortal stage.</p>
<p>Moonlit Rabbit: Mortal (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Strength: 11</p>
<p>Speed: 11</p>
<p>Constitution: 11</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 11</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Moonlight Transformation</p>
<p>Companion Form: Facial Armor</p>
<p>The reason he was using the Moonlight Mask was because of the Moonlight Transformation skill. Although it was only a facial armor, the existence of this skill prevented others from seeing his true identity.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wish to become famous. He only wanted to vent his anger and prevent any Guardian from becoming the King of Earth.</p>
<p>When people saw Grim Demon finally move, they stopped their discussion and focused their gazes on Grim Demon.</p>
<p>Everyone knew very well how terrifying Grim Demon was. Many people even believed that he wasn’t weaker than Ya. He had only admitted defeat because of his relationship with Ya.</p>
<p>They also wanted to know how powerful Grim Demon would be if he really unleashed his combat strength.</p>
<p>Grim Demon walked in front of Zhou Wen step by step. Everyone believed that Grim Demon was about to attack, but Grim Demon’s next move petrified everyone.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1092'>Chapter 1092: Grim Demon’s Stand</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Grim Demon knew that it was time for him to choose a side, but he didn’t feel too conflicted. He chose to stand on Zhou Wen’s side.</p>
<p>Guardians weren’t pure dimensional creatures. They were just tools created by dimensional creatures. He had no feelings for them.</p>
<p>Of course, this wasn’t the reason he chose Zhou Wen. It was mainly because Demonic Neonate was Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast. Demonic Neonate was definitely on Zhou Wen’s side, so Grim Demon had no choice. He would choose whichever side Demonic Neonate stood.</p>
<p>It wasn’t difficult to choose a side. The difficult part was how to make the stand.</p>
<p>Grim Demon knew that Zhou Wen didn’t trust him, and Demonic Neonate listened to Zhou Wen. Therefore, Grim Demon felt that this was a very good opportunity. If he did well and obtained Zhou Wen’s trust, he might be able to escape the awkward position of being “reserve rations.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Grim Demon gritted his teeth and made up his mind. He looked at Zhou Wen and walked over.</p>
<p>Everyone looked forward to the beginning of the battle as their gazes focused on Grim Demon. Now, they only hoped that Grim Demon and Human wouldn’t just disappear again.</p>
<p>Grim Demon didn’t vanish; instead, he slowly walked in front of Zhou Wen. Then, under everyone’s incredulous gazes, he genuflected like a knight and pressed his right hand to his heart. He said to Zhou Wen, “I swear upon my name as Grim Demon that I’m willing to sign a master-slave contract with you and pledge eternal loyalty to you until death…”</p>
<p>The entire world fell dead silent. People couldn’t believe their eyes and ears.</p>
<p>Guardians were Guardians. How honorable and powerful were they? Without exception, the humans who had Guardians had to work extremely hard to obtain the Guardian’s recognition before they had a chance to sign a contract with them.</p>
<p>There were even many people who were willing to pay the price of their lives to contract a Guardian.</p>
<p>It could be said that although the Guardian contract was an equal contract, humans were actually the weaker party in the contract. They were the ones being chosen.</p>
<p>As for the Guardians, their strength paled in comparison to Grim Demon’s. They were much weaker.</p>
<p>Such a powerful Grim Demon had actually taken the initiative to request a contract with the person in front of him. Furthermore, he had requested to sign a master-slave contract. This was completely unheard of.</p>
<p>“Guardians can also sign a master-slave contract?”</p>
<p>“Wait, Grim Demon wants to sign a contract with that person. In other words, that person definitely hasn’t contracted a Guardian.”</p>
<p>A human who has fused with a Guardian can still contract with another Guardian? If it’s not possible, could this person be a pure human?</p>
<p>“That’s impossible. Pure humans are unable to advance to the Mythical stage, so it’s impossible for them to activate the cube to enter the ranking battle.”</p>
<p>“Who is this person? He’s only wearing a mask. Does anyone recognize him?”</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the average person. Even the veteran experts of the six families were shocked. They had never seen such a thing before.</p>
<p>“Old Qiu, can you tell who this person is?” Xia Liuchuan asked.</p>
<p>“I can’t tell. There’s some kind of power that has changed his build. This build isn’t his original build,” Zhang Chunqiu answered.</p>
<p>Messages kept being exchanged overseas. They hoped to find out Human’s true identity.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Grim Demon with an odd expression. He could roughly guess Grim Demon’s thoughts.</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhou Wen wasn’t saying a word, Grim Demon had no choice but to maintain the stance of a knight taking an oath. He kept consoling himself inwardly. I’ll put on a show. For Her Lady Demonic Neonate, I’ll tolerate it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen waved his hand, gesturing for Grim Demon to leave. He wasn’t in the mood to put on an act. All he wanted to do now was kill Guardians, but he took note of Grim Demon’s intentions.</p>
<p>Grim Demon hurriedly got up and admitted defeat before leaving the cube’s arena.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, he doesn’t want a Guardian who came knocking on his door?”</p>
<p>“That’s Grim Demon—a top Guardian. He rejected him just like that?”</p>
<p>“Boss, if you don’t want him, give him to me. I want him.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“This world must be crazy. Such a powerful Guardian took the initiative to request a master-slave contract, but he actually rejected it.”</p>
<p>“Is Grim Demon that dim? He didn’t even attack despite the embarrassment he suffered from Human. He even obediently admitted defeat. Isn’t this too ridiculous?”</p>
<p>“I think Grim Demon knows how powerful Human is, so he took the initiative to request a master-slave contract. Furthermore, he didn’t dare turn hostile.”</p>
<p>“Never compare with others. They only serve to infuriate!”</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Earth. The dimensional creatures watching this battle were also dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Grim Demon was a Guardian. Many dimensional creatures who had experienced the war on Earth in ancient times knew of him. He was also one of the top Guardians back then.</p>
<p>Grim Demon’s actions were just too strange to them. It even made them suspect if Grim Demon was fake.</p>
<p>Soon, the various dimensional races ordered their Guardians on Earth to test Human and figure out what kind of existence Human was.</p>
<p>Due to the restrictions of the rules on Earth, no matter how powerful the dimensional races were, they would be punished by the rules if they personally descended. At most, they would maintain their standards at the Terror grade. They might even drop to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>They couldn’t personally test Zhou Wen either, so they could only observe him through the cube. The information they could obtain was very limited.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen went on stage, he had already thought it through. He had already drawn the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Heaven-Opening on his Wheel of Destiny. Furthermore, he constantly engraved it. Even if the engravings vanished, the subsequent engravings would be replenished, allowing him to maintain an active state of Heaven-Opening Scripture.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>To others, this would expend a large amount of mental strength and Essence Energy, but to Zhou Wen, this expenditure was nothing.</p>
<p>Now, he only wanted to know if the Heaven-Opening Scripture, which could break through the various dimensional zones’ taboo laws, could withstand the cube’s laws.</p>
<p>If he couldn’t withstand it and the dimensional creatures could kick him out like they had kicked Ya away, there would be zero chance. As long as they couldn’t kick him out, he definitely wouldn’t let any Guardian get first place.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen knew that dimensional creatures wouldn’t use the cube’s rules to kick him out immediately.</p>
<p>From the various actions of the dimensional creatures and the information he had obtained from Ice Maiden, he could tell that there were many races in the dimension. They restrained each other and often launched racial wars.</p>
<p>The cube wasn’t something a single race could control. After all, the victor of the cube would allow a race to obtain control of Earth. It was impossible for the rest of the dimension to allow a race to completely control the cube.</p>
<p>It wasn’t an easy task to obtain the approval of all the figures in power and use the rules to kick him out. Even if all the big shots could reach a consensus, it would definitely take some time. Otherwise, the fellows from the dimension wouldn’t have gone through all the various troublesome methods to deal with Ya.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1093'>Chapter 1093: Tiger General’s Might</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The reason Zhou Wen maintained the state of the Heaven-Opening Scripture was to prevent any accidents.</p>
<p>If the bigwigs that had just kicked Ya out were still having a meeting, it would be too unjust for them to reach a conclusion and kick him out too.</p>
<p>Thankfully, what Zhou Wen was worried about didn’t happen. No special power descended on him. Instead, the Guardians’ challenges constantly appeared in front of him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a look and realized that many Guardians who hadn’t advanced to the Terror grade had issued a challenge to him. His heart stirred as he chose to accept the challenge from one of the Mythical Guardians.</p>
<p>The Guardian’s name was Flaming Battle God. Zhou Wen really didn’t know which family his contractor was from. However, just from the name, he knew that it was definitely a fire-elemental Guardian. Furthermore, its ranking wasn’t high. It hadn’t even entered the top ten. The possibility of it being at the Terror grade was almost zero.</p>
<p>Everyone couldn’t help but feel disappointed when they saw that he had chosen Flaming Battle God and not the powerful Cave Era.</p>
<p>After all, Flaming Battle God was much weaker than Grim Demon. Even Grim Demon had automatically admitted defeat, so it was impossible for Flaming Battle God to be his match.</p>
<p>However, there were people who didn’t think so. Now, many human experts knew that when Guardians contracted humans, they valued potential, not absolute strength. Grim Demon chose Human because of his talent, not because of his strength.</p>
<p>The human wearing the armor of Flaming Battle God entered the arena. He was originally a little nervous, afraid that the strange person in front of him was really as powerful as Grim Demon. Then, he would be in danger the moment he appeared.</p>
<p>However, when he saw that the other party had summoned a Companion Beast and had it rush over, it was clear that his opponent planned on letting a Companion Beast fight him. He immediately felt relieved and he became emboldened.</p>
<p>“Why is it a Companion Beast? A Companion Beast is definitely not a Guardian’s match. Don’t tell me he wants to use a Companion Beast to win?”</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, that Companion Beast seems to have some fire-elemental abilities.”</p>
<p>“Does anyone know what Companion Beast that is? Why do I feel like I’ve never seen it before?”</p>
<p>The Companion Beast Zhou Wen had summoned was none other than the Mythical Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. It could be said to be the nemesis of fire-elemental powers. It was perfect for dealing with Flaming Battle God.</p>
<p>The reason Zhou Wen did so was because he didn’t want to scare away the Guardian, nor did he want the big shots to use the cube’s rules to kick him out.</p>
<p>If the Heaven-Opening Scripture couldn’t withstand the cube’s rules, he could at least kill a few Guardians before being kicked out.</p>
<p>“Using fire in front of me?” Seeing the strange flames burning in the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s body rush over, the human wearing the armor of Flaming Battle God sneered. The flames on his body lit up as he condensed a huge flaming saber and slashed at the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>The Tiger Soul General raised its spear to block. After the flaming saber collided with the spear, it immediately transformed into a sea of fire that drowned the Tiger Soul General in flames.</p>
<p>Amidst the flames, the Tiger Soul General’s armor turned red like iron in charcoal. It seemed as if it would melt into liquid metal at any moment.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? Isn’t using a Companion Beast to fight a Guardian a waste of time?”</p>
<p>“Not only is it a waste of time, but it’s also a waste of Companion Beasts. A perfectly fine Companion Beast will probably be killed soon. That’s a Mythical Companion Beast. It’s such a waste.”</p>
<p>“Quickly fight like Ya. Unleash your strength and kill the Guardian.”</p>
<p>People clearly didn’t wish to see a Companion Beast fight. Although Zhou Wen had previously showcased many of his Companion Beasts, it had only been for show and not a real battle.</p>
<p>To most people, it was impossible to use a Companion Beast to defeat a Guardian.</p>
<p>Under Zhou Wen’s control, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General seemed to charge at Flaming Battle God without any regard for its own safety. However, its armor had already been burned red. The situation didn’t look good.</p>
<p>Flaming Battle God slashed out again with his flaming saber, hoping to defeat the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>The flaming saber struck the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s body, causing sparks to fly. It was as though the iron liquid on his body had splattered. Furthermore, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was forced to retreat. Its body was enveloped by more flames and the Tiger Soul General could no longer be seen. All one could see was a figure wrapped in flames retreating in the sea of flames.</p>
<p>“He’s actually not dead yet?” Flaming Battle God frowned slightly. He planned on finishing this Companion Beast quickly.</p>
<p>After all, wasting too much time on a Companion Beast was a disgrace to him.</p>
<p>He gathered his strength and slashed out the flaming saber repeatedly. The flaming saber slashed crazily at the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General in the sea of fire, forcing him to constantly retreat. More and more molten metal splattered out from his body, but after he retreated again and again, the Tiger Soul General that looked like it was about to collapse remained alive.</p>
<p>Flaming Battle God realized that something was amiss. He immediately stopped and used the Wheel of Destiny’s power to repel the Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>Terrifying flames turned from red to golden as they rose from Flaming Battle God’s body. They condensed into a golden flaming chariot that charged at the Tiger Soul General with roaring battle intent.</p>
<p>Everything melted in the wake of the Golden Flaming Chariot. Even the red flames that originated from Flaming Battle God were melted by the golden flames.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The Golden Flaming Chariot slammed into the Tiger Soul General’s body. The flaming wheels spun crazily as though it wanted to crush and melt everything.</p>
<p>The Tiger Soul General’s body was constantly pushed back by the Golden Flaming Chariot. Soon, it was pushed out of the sea of flames.</p>
<p>At that moment, people realized that the Tiger Soul General’s body was burning with purple-red flames. It looked extremely strange. Even its armor had turned crystalline like an amethyst from the purple-red flames.</p>
<p>He wasn’t injured at all. None of the previous attacks had harmed him.</p>
<p>The Tiger Soul General raised the spear with both hands and blocked the Golden Flaming Chariot. Not only did the flames of the Golden Flaming Chariot not injure him, but it also made the flames in his body burn brighter.</p>
<p>Flaming Battle God could tell that there was something wrong with the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, but it was too late. With a boom, the spear in the Tiger Soul General’s hand slammed down and shattered the Golden Flaming Chariot, turning it into golden flames that scattered.</p>
<p>In the next moment, the strange-looking ferocious tiger under the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General let out a roar and charged at Flaming Battle God.</p>
<p>When Flaming Battle God saw that the situation had gone south, he summoned a dragon and a war hammer. They were Mythical Companion Beasts. He rode the dragon and sent the war hammer towards the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>Despite fighting three alone, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s ferocious might did not decrease. The tiger beneath it leaped up and stepped on the dragon. Wherever the tiger claw passed, it left several wounds that burned with purple flames on the dragon’s back, causing it to fall with a tragic cry.</p>
<p>The ferocious tiger used the momentum to pounce at Flaming Battle God. The spear in the Tiger Soul General’s hand met the war hammer. The powerful impact sent the war hammer in Flaming Battle God’s hand flying. He retreated as blood seeped out of his mouth. His expression changed drastically.</p>

<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The people who had been clamoring for Human to attack quickly fell silent. They watched the battle in a daze as their expressions gradually changed.</p>
<p>With the help of the two Mythical Companion Beasts—the dragon and war hammer—and the strength of a Guardian, everyone originally believed that this would be a battle without any suspense.</p>
<p>And indeed, there was no suspense. However, it was different from what they had imagined. The one being suppressed and ravaged was Flaming Battle God.</p>
<p>Looking at the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General that was charging across the arena like a demonic god, a question mark surfaced in many people’s minds.</p>
<p>“What Companion Beast is this? It’s freaking ferocious!”</p>
<p>“Why haven’t I heard of such a ferocious Companion Beast before?”</p>
<p>“He vomited blood again. Flaming Battle God’s armor is about to crack. Furthermore, he was beaten to such a state despite having the help of two Mythical Companion Beasts. This Companion Beast is really powerful.”</p>
<p>“This isn’t right. Isn’t it said that Guardians will definitely defeat Companion Beasts? Why is he being thrashed?”</p>
<p>“Flaming Battle God likely hasn’t unleashed his other ultimate moves, right?”</p>
<p>“What ultimate move? The Golden Flaming Chariot was his ultimate move.”</p>
<p>The spear in the Tiger Soul General’s hand danced wildly as it smashed into Flaming Battle God’s chest, shattering his breastplate. He was sent flying like a sandbag. With the shattered armor pieces, Flaming Battle God tumbled a great distance in the arena before stopping.</p>
<p>The Tiger Soul General didn’t stop. Demonic flames spewed out from its body as it arrived in front of Flaming Battle God like a demon.</p>
<p>There was no chance of Flaming Battle God winning the battle against the Tiger Soul General. The Tiger Soul General had absorbed too many flames early in the battle. Furthermore, the more he fought, the stronger he became. It would be too easy to defeat Flaming Battle God now.</p>
<p>The Flaming Battle God saw that the situation was going south and wanted to admit defeat to leave the arena.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he was still a step too late. Zhou Wen had arrived not far behind him at some point in time. He held something that looked like a grenade in his hand and threw it at Flaming Battle God before quickly retreating.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The energy produced by the explosion of the Ancient Splitting Tadpole’s grenade shattered the already cracked and shattered Flaming Battle God armor into pieces. Furthermore, the explosions were continuous.</p>
<p>After the large Ancient Splitting Tadpole exploded, it split into smaller grenades that continued exploding. The continuous explosions almost instantly blasted the Flaming Battle God to pieces. He was deader than dead.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>“He died just like that?” Some people couldn’t believe that a Guardian had been blasted to death.</p>
<p>“So Guardians aren’t as strong as I imagined. With powerful Companion Beasts, we can still kill them.”</p>
<p>“That requires a Companion Beast to be strong enough. That person’s Companion Beast is extremely strong.”</p>
<p>“The grenade Companion Beast that killed the Flaming Battle God looks like the Ancient Splitting Tadpole from the previous Companion Beast showcase.”</p>
<p>“Now that you mention it, it does seem like it!”</p>
<p>“Could this person be the owner of those Companion Beasts?”</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, that’s really possible!”</p>
<p>Soon, this news spread. All the major media outlets began reporting it. After all, people had a deep impression of the previous Companion Beast showcase.</p>
<p>However, this battle didn’t stop the other Guardians from issuing challenges. Although there were fewer Guardians who issued a challenge, there were still quite a number of them. Many of them were at the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>From their point of view, although Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast was powerful, it wouldn’t be impossible to take it down.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had Mythical Companion Beasts, but so did they. As long as they used them well, it wouldn’t be difficult to defeat the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many people could tell the problem with the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. They knew that the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General could absorb fire-elemental powers and was extremely effective against Flaming Battle God. This was why Flaming Battle God had suffered such a tragic defeat.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at the challenge list and realized that Darkness Emissary who had been frightened away by Grim Demon was among the list. He was also the Guardian Zhou Ming had contracted.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>This fellow actually dares to challenge me? Is he crazy? Zhou Wen knew Zhou Ming quite well.</p>
<p>He didn’t deliberately find out more about Zhou Ming. However, with Grim Demon’s name shaking the world, many media outlets had reported about Zhou Ming.</p>
<p>Grim Demon loved reading those reports and had deliberately read them out loud for them to hear. This was why Zhou Wen knew a little.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that there was only one possibility for such a selfish and cowardly fellow to take the risk to challenge him. Something had given him the courage.</p>
<p>What could it be? Could it be that a dimensional Terror creature will descend on him like Jiuyue? Zhou Wen felt that it was impossible.</p>
<p>No matter how spineless a Calamity-grade dimensional creature was, it wouldn’t choose the body of such a low-level human for its descent, right? Even if it wanted to choose, it would choose someone like Cave Era or Jiuyue.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and chose Darkness Emissary as his next opponent.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Ming, who was wearing the Darkness Emissary armor, appeared in the arena. The moment he appeared, he began condensing the Door of Darkness.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Zhou Ming condensed the Door of Darkness very quickly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately saw the problem. Zhou Ming held a black crystal in his hand. Most of the power that condensed the Door of Darkness came from the black crystal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t a madman like Ya, nor was he interested in knowing what the black crystal was or how the Door of Darkness was different from before.</p>
<p>Therefore, he immediately drew his Night Immaculate Sword. The sword that resembled smoke tore through the air and stabbed at Zhou Ming. He wanted to kill him along with Darkness Emissary before Zhou Ming could condense the Door of Darkness.</p>
<p>Although Night Immaculate wasn’t absolutely invincible, Zhou Ming was currently condensing the Door of Darkness. He couldn’t move at all. Once he moved, the channeling of the Door of Darkness would be interrupted. All his previous efforts would be in vain.</p>
<p>Zhou Ming watched as Night Immaculate flew over like a rainbow. He had no intention of dodging. The moment Night Immaculate stabbed into the Darkness Emissary armor, a golden light bloomed from his chest.</p>
<p>It was a golden rune that transformed into a golden barrier that protected Zhou Ming.</p>
<p>The Night Immaculate Sword crisscrossed and struck the golden barrier again and again, but it failed to slice through it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the golden barrier and felt the power on it. No matter how stupid he was, he understood that be it the golden runes or the black crystal, it was definitely the work of the dimension.</p>
<p>Those with keen eyes could guess what had happened. They were very worried for Human, afraid that Ya’s encounter would repeat itself.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared at the Door of Darkness. He knew that dimension’s techniques weren’t that simple. The truly terrifying thing would definitely be inside the Door of Darkness.</p>
<p>Could it be that a dimensional creature wants to use the Door of Darkness to descend personally? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>The Door of Darkness condensed at an extremely fast speed. It took only a moment for it to take shape. With a boom, the Door of Darkness opened. A roar that sounded like it came from the depths of an abyss came from deep within the Door of Darkness.</p>
<p>Is a dimensional creature descending personally? Zhou Wen stared intently at the Door of Darkness.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1095'>Chapter 1095: Darkness Domain Devil</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Terrifying footsteps sounded from the Door of Darkness. Every step seemed to shake the void.</p>
<p>Seeing a black figure walk out of the door, Zhou Wen retracted his Night Immaculate Sword and didn’t continue attacking Zhou Ming because it was too late.</p>
<p>Through the cube, people gradually saw the creature that came out of the door. It was a monster that seemed to be enveloped by darkness. Its indistinct figure in the darkness was like a huge minotaur.</p>
<p>With its huge bull’s horn, arrow-shaped tail, and legs with reverse joints it walked out of the Door of Darkness step by step and landed in the arena. The entire arena seemed to be enveloped by the terrifying dark aura.</p>
<p>Unlike Night Thearch’s Evernight powers, the dark aura didn’t block out the light. One could still see the monster’s faintly discernible figure, but this feeling made one feel even more terrified.</p>
<p>In an ancient temple on a plateau, an old man played with a Demonfall Pestle as he looked at the cube screen beside him. When he saw the dark minotaur appear, he couldn’t help but frown slightly. Using Darkness Emissary’s Door of Darkness, he summoned the top Terror-grade creature, Dark Domain Devil, into the arena. He bypassed the suppression of Earth’s rules and allowed the Dark Domain Devil to maintain its full strength after its descent. Those fellows from the dimension will really think of any method to prevent humans from obtaining first place.</p>
<p>However, will Dark Domain Devil really fulfill their wish? Jing Daoxian looked at Zhou Wen, who was on the other side of the arena. His eyes shimmered with a strange glint as he fiddled with the Demonfall Pestle and muttered to himself, “Let me see how far you have come.”</p>
<p>“How shameless. Such a creature isn’t something a fellow like Zhou Ming can summon. It must be those fellows from the dimension,” Li Xuan said angrily.</p>
<p>Wang Lu hugged Ya’er and said, “The cube is the home ground of dimensional creatures to begin with. If you want to win in such an environment, you have to be prepared to fight in adversarial situations.”</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan also said, “What I’m most worried about isn’t this Terror creature. I’m afraid that Coach will be like Ya and be kicked out by them using the cube’s rules. He won’t even have a chance to fight.”</p>
<p>“Those shameless fellows will definitely do such a thing.” Li Xuan agreed with Feng Qiuyan’s point of view.</p>
<p>Others might not recognize Zhou Wen, but they knew him too well. They had already recognized him from his Companion Beasts, so they were somewhat worried.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. Zhou Wen won’t be kicked out so easily,” Wei Ge said with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>He had come to the Wang family residence to pass on Zhou Wen’s message to Li Xuan and company. When he saw Zhou Wen enter the arena, he stayed behind to watch the battle.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou has many strange abilities, but this is their home ground after all. The rules were set by them… It’s not easy…” Li Xuan felt his balls ache just thinking about it. It was clearly a battle that decided the King of Earth, but the rules weren’t set by the creatures on Earth.</p>
<p>“Darkness Domain Devil, kill him!” Zhou Ming pointed at Zhou Wen excitedly.</p>
<p>Although he hadn’t summoned Darkness Domain Devil with his own strength and had the help of the dimensional creatures, this was a chance that brought him closest to being the King of Earth.</p>
<p>With the power of Darkness Domain Devil, as long as he defeated this strange person in front of him, he had a high chance of obtaining the Dimensional Wheel and becoming the King of Earth.</p>
<p>Darkness Domain Devil ignored him and stared at Zhou Wen. Its blood-red eyes in the darkness were like a pair of huge red lanterns.</p>
<p>Although Darkness Domain Devil had been summoned by Zhou Ming, it wasn’t a summoned beast. It was a very famous creature in the Darkness Domain, one of the strongest Terror-grade creatures in the dimension.</p>
<p>If not for some reason, Darkness Domain Devil would have long advanced to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>The dimensional bigwigs had secretly planned this operation. They had gotten Darkness Domain Devil to descend with the Door of Darkness Door because they hoped to settle this once and for all. They didn’t want any additional problems.</p>
<p>Previously, they had paid a huge price to forcefully kick Ya out of the game. Only then did the various bigwigs agree to use the cube’s nomological forces. If it happened again, ignoring the bigwigs who knew that their race had no hope of obtaining first place, just inviting those bigwigs over wouldn’t be an easy task.</p>
<p>“Weak creatures like humans are always capable of causing a lot of trouble. In the past, those fellows were already troublesome. I never expected these fellows to be even more troublesome now.” A mysterious shadow felt a headache coming on.</p>
<p>They were clearly creatures that were so weak that they couldn’t advance to the Mythical stage, but they could take advantage of every opportunity and do something that gave them a headache.</p>
<p>“Any last wishes? If it’s not too difficult, I can try my best to satisfy you,” Darkness Domain Devil said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>It naturally didn’t have good intentions. This was also one of its abilities. If its opponent’s will was shaken, it would make its strength even stronger.</p>
<p>Although its opponent was only an Earthling, Darkness Domain Devil wasn’t careless at all. It treated Zhou Wen as an opponent of the same level. It only wanted to use the safest method to kill its opponent in exchange for the benefits promised by the dimensional bigwigs.</p>
<p>In a battle of the same level, strength was, needless to say, important. But apart from that, the strength of a creature’s will was extremely important in battle.</p>
<p>“I do have a wish. It’s not too difficult. I hope you can satisfy me,” Zhou Wen said after some serious thought.</p>
<p>Darkness Domain Devil was slightly delighted. It thought that Zhou Wen’s will had wavered, so it asked, “Tell me, what’s your wish?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sized up Darkness Domain Devil and said in all seriousness, “Can you let me see your true body?”</p>
<p>Darkness Domain Devil was slightly taken aback. It never expected Zhou Wen to make such a request. It immediately knew that Zhou Wen’s will hadn’t wavered. Perhaps he was just stalling for time.</p>
<p>At that moment, Darkness Domain Devil didn’t waste any more time. The dark aura on its body surged like a tidal wave over the arena. Soon, it enveloped the entire cube, preventing outsiders from seeing anything.</p>
<p>However, the dark aura didn’t injure anyone. Instead, the blood-red eyes of Darkness Domain Devil eyes intensified, but under the envelopment of the Darkness Domain, no one could see it.</p>
<p>“Come, let me bring your soul into the dark abyss. Enjoy the joy of depravity!” Darkness Domain Devil approached Zhou Wen with the tide of dark aura. At the same time, the sanguine light in its eyes intensified as though it had some soul-stealing power.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Wheel of Destiny kept circulating as he watched every move of Darkness Domain Devil. When he saw the pair of eyes, he immediately felt attracted to them as though his soul was about to be sucked in.</p>
<p>Thankfully, his willpower and mental strength were stronger than ordinary people. He temporarily stabilized his mind, but he pretended to be attracted by it. As though he was in a daze, he walked towards Darkness Domain Devil step by step.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1096'>Chapter 1096: What’s Going On?</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>In the Darkness Domain, Zhou Wen walked towards Darkness Domain Devil. Soon, he arrived in front of it.</p>
<p>“Come, follow me into the depraved abyss of happiness…” Darkness Domain Devil lowered its head and extended its palms as though it wanted to lift Zhou Wen up. At the same time, its face approached Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Just as its palms were about to touch him, Zhou Wen suddenly vanished. When he appeared again, he was already in front of Dark Domain Devil’s eyes. He held an ice crystal-like dragon tooth in his hand and stabbed at its eyes.</p>
<p>The tip of the dragon tooth was about to touch the eyeball of Darkness Domain Devil when a palm suddenly extended out of the darkness and grabbed the dragon tooth.</p>
<p>“You are still too young to play dirty in front of me.” Darkness Domain Devil grinned hideously. It grabbed the Dragon Tooth with one hand and grabbed Zhou Wen’s body with the other. At the same time, it said, “It’s no wonder you dare be so arrogant. You actually have a Terror item. This isn’t something that any Terror creature can condense… Ah…”</p>
<p>Before Darkness Domain Devil could finish its sentence, blood bloomed in its eyes. Demonic Neonate had stabbed it in the eye with Demonic Sword.</p>
<p>Darkness Domain Devil’s reaction was also extremely fast. It reached out to crush Zhou Wen, but when its other eye saw Demonic Neonate, its hand froze as its eyes were filled with disbelief.</p>
<p>Its palm unknowingly released Zhou Wen as he fell to the ground, turning into a Substitute Talisman in midair. Zhou Wen’s true body appeared elsewhere.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate immediately retreated after a successful strike and landed in Zhou Wen’s arms.</p>
<p>“No… Impossible…” Darkness Domain Devil stared at Demonic Neonate as its injured eyes rapidly healed. However, it had no intention of attacking Zhou Wen. It only stared intently at Demonic Neonate with a look of horror as though it had seen a ghost.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that something was amiss and had a bad feeling. He immediately unsummoned Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>Darkness Domain Devil clearly knew Demonic Neonate, or rather, it had seen an existence similar to Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>In the past, the fact that Grim Demon knew Demonic Neonate had made Zhou Wen feel that something was amiss. Grim Demon was ultimately a Guardian born on Earth.</p>
<p>However, Darkness Domain Devil was different. It was a creature from the dimension. It actually recognized Demonic Neonate and from its alarmed look, this was a huge problem.</p>
<p>If Demonic Neonate was really related to the dimension, who knew what would happen if the big shots of the dimension saw him using Demonic Neonate in the arena.</p>
<p>From Ya’s previous encounter, it could be seen that the fellows in the dimension were different from humans. They didn’t care about their reputation at all. They were very dangerous considering how unscrupulous they were to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was somewhat glad that he had summoned Demonic Neonate in the darkness. Otherwise, Demonic Neonate would have been completely exposed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen already had the intention to kill. He was just about to summon Banana Fairy and kill Darkness Domain Devil with all his might.</p>
<p>However, before Zhou Wen could take action, he saw Darkness Domain Devil suddenly retract its Darkness Domain. Even the Darkness aura on its body completely converged, revealing its true body.</p>
<p>The spectators stared at the black screen. They couldn’t see anything, but clearly, the creature Zhou Ming had summoned was definitely a Terror-grade existence.</p>
<p>Many people were worried for Zhou Wen, hoping to know the outcome as soon as possible. However, they were also worried that they would see Zhou Wen’s tragic death when the darkness vanished.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Ming himself couldn’t see anything in the darkness.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the darkness in the arena vanished. Not only did the darkness disappear, but even the black gas surrounding the Darkness Domain Devil vanished.</p>
<p>Only then did everyone see that the true body of the Darkness Domain Devil wasn’t as huge as they had imagined. It was only about ten meters tall, but it was already very majestic compared to humans.</p>
<p>It had a bull’s head and hooves, but its body and hands looked human. Furthermore, it was wearing a black robe. It looked very strange.</p>
<p>Seeing that Darkness Domain Devil was unharmed, everyone was alarmed. They hurriedly searched the other corners of the arena, worried that Zhou Wen had been killed.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen standing there perfectly fine without any injuries, they couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“What are you standing there for? Quickly finish him off!” Zhou Ming was immediately disappointed when he saw that Zhou Wen wasn’t dead. He immediately urged Darkness Domain Devil to quickly kill Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>This was because the dimensional creatures he had come into contact with had told him that Darkness Domain Devil was invincible among Terror-grade existences. As long as he summoned it over, there was no way for him to lose.</p>
<p>The next second, Darkness Domain Devil finally moved, but its target wasn’t Zhou Wen. It turned around and looked at Zhou Ming, who was wearing the Darkness Emissary armor.</p>
<p>Its eyes shimmered with a sanguine glow like the eyes of the Devil. In an instant, Zhou Ming and the Darkness Emissary armor on his body exploded. Blood spewed everywhere, instantly leaving nothing behind.</p>
<p>This turn of events stunned everyone. They looked at the arena in a daze, unsure what had happened.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just humans. Many creatures in the dimension were also stunned. The eyes of the big shot who had arranged for Darkness Domain Devil to descend into the arena twitched as he had a strong ominous feeling.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as well, but he quickly thought of something. Could it be that this fellow is the same as Grim Demon? Is it related to Demonic Neonate or her lineage?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was momentarily hesitant. Should he continue summoning Banana Fairy to silence it? Darkness Domain Devil was very powerful, so it didn’t seem easy to silence it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, without the cover of the Darkness Domain, if he wanted to kill it without using Demonic Neonate, he would probably have to expose most of his abilities.</p>
<p>After all, this was a combat arena where one could admit defeat. Zhou Wen wasn’t confident that he could kill Darkness Domain Devil before it admitted defeat.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was hesitating and everyone was puzzled, Darkness Domain Devil suddenly took a step forward and genuflected. Just like Grim Demon from before, it placed its right hand on its chest and lowered its head.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“Wasn’t this thing summoned by Zhou Ming? Isn’t it a Terror creature from the dimension?”</p>
<p>“Probably…”</p>
<p>Instantly, the Federation was in an uproar. It made sense if Grim Demon had something to do with Human, but Darkness Domain Devil was a dimensional creature summoned by Zhou Ming. Why did it kneel after the screen turned black and lit up?</p>
<p>Only Zhou Wen knew that Darkness Domain Devil was kneeling to Demonic Neonate, not him.</p>
<p>“Little Yanyan, pinch me. See if I’m still dreaming?” Li Xuan said to Feng Qiuyan with a strange expression.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1097'>Chapter 1097: Little Fairy Appears</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Ah!” Li Xuan let out a tragic cry as he held his swollen face. His fingers trembled as he pointed at Feng Qiuyan and jumped. “Why did you use so much strength?”</p>
<p>“How can you be sure if you aren’t dreaming if I don’t use more strength?” Feng Qiuyan muttered to himself, “Seeing how much pain you are in, you should be able to confirm that you aren’t dreaming.”</p>
<p>“But you don’t have to use so much strength, right? Do you want to pinch me to death? If it wasn’t for my extraordinary physique, my face would have been flattened by you,” Li Xuan said unrelentingly.</p>
<p>“Others will die when facing such strength, but you won’t,” Feng Qiuyan said calmly.</p>
<p>Li Xuan opened his mouth and realized that he had no means to refute him. He swallowed his words.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan was certain that this wasn’t a dream. Darkness Domain Devil continued kneeling there with its head bowed at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Due to the deaths of Zhou Ming and Darkness Emissary, the Door of Darkness dissipated at the same time. Darkness Domain Devil lost the protection of this layer of connection and was immediately repelled by Earth’s laws. The Darkness aura on its body was rapidly dissipating.</p>
<p>As Darkness Domain Devil fought the terrifying nomological force, it bowed three times respectfully in Zhou Wen’s direction. Without a word, it turned around and admitted defeat before leaving the arena and returning to the dimension.</p>
<p>Although Darkness Domain Devil didn’t say a word, anyone could tell that he had simply treated Zhou Wen as a god.</p>
<p>Previously, Grim Demon had only genuflected. Now, the powerful dimensional creature, Darkness Domain Devil, had bowed so respectfully. It was truly unbelievable.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? Is Human actually a powerful creature from the dimension in disguise?”</p>
<p>“He can’t be human, right?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so…”</p>
<p>People began to wonder if Human was human, but only humans could use Companion Beasts. This also meant that Human was human—or at least half-human.</p>
<p>However, how could a human have such glory? He had actually made Darkness Domain Devil bow to him. It was a terrifying existence that could instantly kill a Guardian at a glance, but in front of Zhou Wen, it was like a slave and had treated Zhou Wen like a god. It was unbelievable that he was really a human.</p>
<p>As a result, many Guardians who originally wanted to issue a challenge hesitated.</p>
<p>Darkness Domain Devil was clearly at the Terror grade and sent by the dimension. It had extremely terrifying strength. Yet, such an existence was so subservient in front of this fellow who claimed to be Human. They were really afraid.</p>
<p>Ignoring the human contractor, even the Guardian itself was afraid. Even though the dimensional bigwigs kept urging Guardians to enter the arena, none of them dared to do so.</p>
<p>Time ticked by. If no one challenged him in an hour, Human would obtain first place on the rankings.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of silence, someone finally issued a challenge. The challenger was Cave Era.</p>
<p>Cave Era was a Terror-grade Guardian with the power of time. After entering the arena, she immediately turned into her Terror form and vanished from everyone’s eyes.</p>
<p>Others couldn’t see her, but Zhou Wen could see her very clearly. Her Terror form couldn’t escape his eyes, but after Cave Era entered her Terror form, her body obtained the augmentation of time power. Under the acceleration of time, her movement technique was unbelievably fast.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate to summon Banana Fairy. The fairy-like Banana Fairy appeared in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Her elegant and beautiful appearance immediately attracted everyone’s attention.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy pouted her red lips and blew out a breath. A cold wind instantly rose over the arena and swept towards the Terror-form of Cave Era.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Cave Era summoned a triangular blade transformed from a Companion Beast and charged at the cold wind with a cold beam.</p>
<p>The cold beam pierced through the cold wind, but it only moved half a foot forward. As for Cave Era’s body, it was sent flying by the cold wind. She was kicked out of her Terror state in midair and instantly flew for an unknown distance. She vanished from the screen, her whereabouts unknown.</p>
<p>“Is… Is that a Companion Beast?”</p>
<p>“Heavens, that Companion Beast is too terrifying. She blew away the Terror-grade Cave Era with a single breath. It’s no wonder Grim Demon and Darkness Domain Devil are so fearful of Human. Such a powerful Companion Beast is practically invincible.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t this too fake? The Terror-grade Cave Era was blown away just like that.”</p>
<p>“What’s the use of being strong? Looks are what matters. Just look at how beautiful that Companion Beast is and you’ll know that she’s definitely invincible. If she were to wheedle at me, I would definitely die of joy.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“A beautiful humanoid Companion Beast that’s so terrifyingly powerful. How much did that brother suffer in his previous life to exchange for such a Companion Beast in this life?”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Everyone was alarmed by Banana Fairy’s strength and beauty. They explained away the respect Grim Demon and Darkness Domain Devil showed by her existence.</p>
<p>It wasn’t their fault for thinking that way. The battle Banana Fairy had displayed was just too shocking. A small gust of wind blew the Terror-grade powerhouse away. She looked way overpowered.</p>
<p>However, they didn’t know that Banana Fairy only had a few moves. Apart from blowing wind, she didn’t do anything else.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched as Cave Era was blown away by the Supreme Yin Wind. Her body was almost frozen into ice in midair. He felt that she was doomed.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, a figure flashed. Cave Era strangely returned to the arena and appeared where she had been standing as though she had never moved.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sized up Cave Era in surprise and asked, “Time reversal?”</p>
<p>“I don’t have such powerful strength to reverse time. Not to mention reversing time, I can’t even stop time. Otherwise, you and Ya would have died long ago.” Cave Era answered coldly, “It’s just a time mark. By marking a time point, my body can return to that time point. The mark can only last a maximum of three seconds.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t use this move when you fought Ya, right?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I can only use it once. So even if I had used it, I would still have lost. There was no point in using it,” said Cave Era.</p>
<p>“In that case, you believe that you can’t beat Ya, but you can beat me?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“At the very least, there’s a chance,” Cave Era said as she transformed into her Terror form again and charged at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy blew out the Supreme Yin Wind again. However, the speed of the Supreme Yin Wind couldn’t catch up to Cave Era after she accelerated time. Cave Era circled around the Supreme Yin Wind and continued charging at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy was a wind-elemental divine pet. In terms of speed, she wasn’t slower than Cave Era. With Cave Era accelerating time, Banana Fairy still caught up to her. With a grab, the banana leaf under her became a fan that appeared in her hand. She fanned it at Cave Era, and her figure vanished as she entered her Terror form. It was as though she had transformed into an invisible wind.</p>
<p>This was a battle of speed. Banana Fairy and Cave Era were unbelievably fast; ordinary people couldn’t see their figures. All they could see was the wind constantly flowing across the arena.</p>
<p>After Banana Fairy was lured away, Cave Era suddenly summoned four Mythical Companion Beasts and sent them charging at Zhou Wen.</p>

<p>Ordinary people couldn’t see Banana Fairy and Cave Era, but the four Mythical Companion Beasts could see them clearly.</p>
<p>“Ghidorah … World Wolf… Dark Troll and Pharaoh…” Many people immediately recognized the Mythical Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that they were knowledgeable, but that the four Companion Beasts were so famous.</p>
<p>Ghidorah was known as the strongest Strength-type Companion Beast in the North District. The World Wolf was known as the fastest Companion Beast in the North District.</p>
<p>Dark Troll was a famous Mythical Companion Beast in the West District. Its body was extremely powerful, and it also had the ability to use darkness magic. It was an excellent Companion Beast that practiced both magic and martial arts. It was said that no one had been able to defeat and kill it in the Darkness Abyss. No one expected Cave Era to possess the Dark Troll Companion Beast.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>There was no need to mention Pharaoh. He was a divine Companion Beast with Mythical magic powers.</p>
<p>These four famous Mythical Companion Beasts had appeared together with Cave Era. It made Zhou Wen break out into a cold sweat.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>This was because most people believed that Banana Fairy was what Human relied on the most. Now that Banana Fairy had been lured away by Cave Era, it was still unknown if Human could deal with these four powerful Mythical Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Do you want to compete with Companion Beasts? Zhou Wen saw the four Companion Beasts rush over, but he had no intention of retreating. He directly summoned most of his Companion Beasts that had appeared on the rankings.</p>
<p>The six Demon Blood True Dragons appeared out of nowhere and lined up in front of Zhou Wen. The last time he had gone to the underground sea, he had obtained another one. Now, he was only three short of the nine Demon Blood True Dragons.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Demon Blood True Dragons were very strange. It didn’t drop every time, but when something dropped, it would definitely be a Demon Blood True Dragon with a different attribute. Zhou Wen had never had a Demon Blood True Dragon with the same attribute drop.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen guessed that it might be because the Demon Blood True Dragon’s Companion Beast had a unique characteristic. Perhaps after it dropped, no one else could get it to drop again.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen only hoped to have the nine Companion Eggs drop before others went to the underground sea to kill the Demon Blood True Dragon. He wanted to see how powerful the nine Demon Blood True Dragons were.</p>
<p>“Wow… Six Demon Blood True Dragons… Three Golden Battle God Halberds… Splitting Ancient Tadpoles… Devil Clown… Night Immaculate Sword… And the fire-elemental knight who fought previously… The Invisibility Cloak should be here too… These Companion Beasts really belong to the same person…”</p>
<p>“What kind of luck is this… Six Demon Blood True Dragons… Three Golden Battle God Halberds… Holy sh*t…”</p>
<p>“Together with that beautiful fairy-like Companion Beast, how many Mythical Companion Beasts does this fellow have?”</p>
<p>“Is this fellow having an affair with Lady Luck? Why is he getting all the good pets?”</p>
<p>Instantly, everyone was alarmed. The four Mythical Companion Beast battle lineup from Cave Era were already very shocking, but the Companion Beasts Zhou Wen summoned couldn’t be called a battle lineup. They were like a sea of pets.</p>
<p>The originally aggressive Ghidorah was instantly surrounded by six Demon Blood True Dragons. The Pharaoh was being pursued by the three Golden Battle God Halberds. The Night Immaculate Sword transformed into a shocking sword beam that circled the World Wolf. Sword marks appeared on the World Wolf’s body as blood dyed its fur red.</p>
<p>Others believed that it was caused by Night Immaculate’s sword aura, but in fact, it was the invisible combination of the Light Concealment Sword and Night Immaculate Sword. It was just that others couldn’t see Light Concealment Sword.</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, Devil Clown, and Ancient Splitting Tadpole fought the Dark Troll. In just a moment, the Dark Troll’s skin and flesh were lacerated.</p>
<p>After being hit by the Devil Clown’s magic ball, he was immediately at a loss for what to do. He could only be thrashed by the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General and couldn’t dodge the explosion of the Ancient Splitting Tadpole.</p>
<p>As long as the Ancient Splitting Tadpole didn’t explode nine times in a row, it could slowly recover. There was no need to worry.</p>
<p>The onlookers enjoyed the spectacle. They couldn’t see the earlier Terror-grade battles at all. They could only imagine and make all sorts of guesses, making them feel depressed.</p>
<p>Now, in such a battle of Mythical Companion Beasts, although it might not be as strong as a Terror-grade, it was very satisfying watching it.</p>
<p>The only bad thing was that the Companion Beasts in the cave were being ganged up on. They could only suffer a beating. Occasionally, they could counterattack, but they couldn’t cause too much of a stir.</p>
<p>“If I had so many powerful Companion Beasts, I would dare vie with those Guardians.”</p>
<p>“Pui! I just need that beautiful fairy Companion Beast. That’s equivalent to having the entire world. What’s there to fight for!”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Luoyang’s An family.</p>
<p>“Overseer, Young Master Wen’s Companion Beast army is really terrifying. With so many Mythical Companion Beasts, I’m afraid he has the ability to sweep through the Federation,” An Sheng said as he watched the live broadcast.</p>
<p>“Companion Beasts are ultimately external forces,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“Companion Beasts are external forces. Guardians are external forces. Guns and cannons are also external forces. Humans are experts who are good at using external forces. Young Master Wen is already at the epitome when it comes to Companion Beasts. I’m afraid no one on Earth can compare with him,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo frowned and said, “If you have the time to think of so many words of praise, why don’t you think about how to resolve the problem of the accelerator?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Overseer. I’ll think about it now.” An Sheng realized that he had been a little too smug and things were going south. After giving a military salute, he turned around and wanted to escape.</p>
<p>“Come back,” An Tianzuo said coldly.</p>
<p>“Overseer, I’m aware of my mistakes.” An Sheng turned his head with a bitter expression.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo snorted coldly. “It’s fine if you blow his trumpet here. If that punk also thinks that he’s invincible with those Companion Beasts, he probably won’t even know how he died. However, it’s good that he’s dead. His death can bring me some peace.”</p>
<p>“Overseer, what do you mean? What means does the dimension have to restrain Young Master Wen’s Companion Beasts?” An Sheng asked carefully.</p>
<p>“Why would there be a need for the dimension to do something? According to what I know, there’s a Guardian who has a skill similar to a seal. However, it’s not a sealing of a person’s body, but a sealing of Companion Beasts. Under his influence, no one can summon a Companion Beast. If that punk is as arrogant as you, he will definitely die.” An Tianzuo drank a cup of water and added, “It’s good if such a fellow dies. That reduces the havoc he will create everywhere. The Federation is already chaotic enough. It’s good that there’s one less scourge.”</p>
<p>“Overseer, when this battle ends, I’ll think of a way to inform Young Master Wen.” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“It’s your own business if you want to inform him. Why are you asking me? I can’t wait for that troublemaker to be taught a lesson,” An Tianzuo said expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m the one who wants to tell Young Master Wen. It has nothing to do with you, Overseer.” As An Sheng spoke, his eyes darted to An Tianzuo. “But I don’t know where Young Master Wen is now. How can I contact him?”</p>
<p>“Don’t look at me. Don’t have any ideas about my voice transmission bell. Don’t think that I’ll lend it to you,” An Tianzuo said as he turned around and drank his tea.</p>

<p>Instead of saying that Cave Era had lured Banana Fairy away, it was better to say that Banana Fairy had held back Cave Era, attacking her until she could only constantly escape. She didn’t dare take on Banana Fairy’s Supreme Yin Wind.</p>
<p>Seeing that her Companion Beast was about to be ganked to death, and that she wasn’t Banana Fairy’s match, Cave Era could only admit defeat and leave the cube.</p>
<p>“This is more satisfying. It’s great watching this.”</p>
<p>“So Companion Beasts can be so powerful. Pure Companion Beasts can defeat a Guardian. There’s nothing impressive about a Guardian.”</p>
<p>“That beautiful fairy Companion Beast is practically my dream lover. When can I have such a Companion Beast?”</p>
<p>As no one challenged him, Zhou Wen temporarily left the cube.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen’s phone rang. This left him puzzled because there was no signal here. He couldn’t contact Li Xuan and company even if he wanted to.</p>
<p>He took out his phone and saw that it was An Sheng.</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng, how did you get through?” Zhou Wen glanced at his phone and realized that there was still no signal, but the call was very normal.</p>
<p>“It’s all thanks to…” Before An Sheng could finish his sentence, An Tianzuo, who was sitting in his office chair, looked up and glared at him. He immediately corrected himself. “It’s just a special Companion Beast. Let’s not talk about that. Young Master Wen, you have to be careful of a Guardian named Blood Shaman. He has the ability to seal Companion Beasts. No one can use a Companion Beast in front of him. Overs… Du… du…”</p>
<p>Just as An Sheng was about to say the word ‘Overseer,’ An Tianzuo reached out and took back the bell in An Sheng’s hand. An Sheng could only shake his head helplessly.</p>
<p>“Hello… Ah Sheng… Hello…” Zhou Wen suddenly couldn’t hear any sound. He looked at his phone’s screen and realized that the line had been disconnected. He couldn’t get through again. There was no signal.</p>
<p>What Companion Beast is that? It can actually forcefully connect without a signal. I have to think of a way to get one later. Although Zhou Wen seldom made calls, it was irritating when he needed to make a call but did not have a signal.</p>
<p>Blood Shaman? I wonder if the Heaven-Opening Scripture can withstand the power of the seal. Is the seal considered a nomological power? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that it wasn’t safe to rely on the Heaven-Opening Scripture alone. If it didn’t work, he would have to rely on himself.</p>
<p>As for whether Blood Shaman would appear, Zhou Wen didn’t doubt it at all. The dimensional bigwigs definitely wouldn’t watch him take first place. As long as there was such a Guardian, there was a 99% chance of it coming to deal with him. The other 1% was them having been taken down by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Time ticked by. After more than half an hour, there was still no Guardian challenging Zhou Wen. Furthermore, people were still excitedly discussing the various Companion Beasts Zhou Wen had used.</p>
<p>The various media outlets were analyzing Zhou Wen’s various Companion Beasts, especially Banana Fairy. Almost all the headlines of the various media outlets used her as a cover.</p>
<p>Li Benyi was the fastest. During the pet showcase from before, he had already made plenty of Companion Beast merchandise. However, they weren’t too popular back then. Now, they were absolutely popular.</p>
<p>Li Benyi’s dolls and figurines began to sell like hotcakes. As for the Guardian figurines and figurines that sold very well, the market demand was much lower. Almost no one cared about them now.</p>
<p>In the past, they had no choice. They felt that Guardians were too powerful and could only support Guardians.</p>
<p>However, now that Human’s Companion Beasts had appeared out of nowhere, it allowed people to see the strength of Companion Beasts. It also changed people’s perception of Companion Beasts and brought them back to the sights of humanity.</p>
<p>Ordinary people couldn’t come into contact with Guardians, but they had a high chance of obtaining Companion Beasts. They naturally wished to believe that Companion Beasts were the strongest.</p>
<p>At that moment, the dimension wasn’t calm either. How long had it been since Earth had recovered? Yet, a Terror-grade Companion Beast had appeared. This was extremely terrifying for the dimension.</p>
<p>If this continued, a Calamity-grade Companion Beast might soon appear on Earth. That was a situation that the dimension was very unwilling to see.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In front of a glorious palace, a warrior in gorgeous armor genuflected and said with his head lowered, “Your Excellency, we have already contacted Blood Shaman. He has also agreed to fight, but he wants ten divine fruits.”</p>
<p>“Give them to him.” A familiar voice sounded from the palace. He was the one who had presided over the cube battle and changed the rules.</p>
<p>“Yes.” The warrior stood up and was about to leave when he heard another voice coming from the palace. “How’s the situation with the other members of the Octokind?”</p>
<p>“They have already agreed to lend out the Body Cleansing Stone, but the price is very high. They are still negotiating,” the warrior answered.</p>
<p>“Didn’t the Dragon King stop it?” the voice in the palace said again.</p>
<p>“No,” the warrior answered.</p>
<p>“You’re dismissed. Tell them that they have to bring back the Body Cleansing Stone.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>After the warrior left, a god-like man was sitting sideways on the roof of the palace, frowning in thought.</p>
<p>A seductive woman circled around the man’s body and leaned her fair head against his chest as she said gently, “Your Excellency Di Tian, why does it have to be a Body Cleansing Stone? The monarchs of the various races are already communicating with each other. I believe there will be an outcome very soon. When that happens, that person will be kicked out of the rankings like Ya. Why do you have to pay such a huge price to obtain the Body Cleansing Stone?”</p>
<p>“It’s just preparing for a rainy day. We absolutely must not let existences like Ya and Human obtain the Dimensional Wheel, much less give them a chance to stand on Wang Mingyuan’s side,” Di Tian said indifferently. “It’s fine if he’s kicked out. Otherwise, the Body Cleansing Stone will naturally be of use.”</p>
<p>“How can he not be kicked out? He’s just a human. How can he resist the cube’s rules? Furthermore, with Blood Shaman restraining his Companion Beasts, he will probably be defeated in the next round. Your Excellency Di Tian, you don’t have to worry excessively about a mere human,” the woman said.</p>
<p>Di Tian didn’t say anything. He only used his fingers to stroke the woman’s beautiful hair that was like a river in the night. His eyes were deep and unfathomable.</p>
<p>“Worry excessively? That fellow is also a human. If I don’t worry too much, I’m afraid a second or third person will appear…” The figure of the gentle-looking man appeared in Di Tian’s mind.</p>
<p>When an hour was almost up, and people thought that Human was about to obtain first place, the cube suddenly lit up. Another person issued a challenge.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at the cube’s screen, but the name they saw was unfamiliar. They had never seen it before.</p>
<p>It’s really him. Zhou Wen saw the word Blood Shaman and couldn’t help but be grateful for An Sheng’s timely intelligence. Although he might not have been at a disadvantage without the intelligence, it was better to be prepared in advance than to think of a solution at the last minute.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen agreed to the challenge. No matter who came, he had to do his best to vie for first place. As long as he wasn’t kicked out like Ya, he definitely wouldn’t let any Guardian become the King of Earth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Blood Shaman appeared in the arena at the same time. Blood Shaman in blood-colored armor made a shocking move. He extended his hand and swiped at his palm, causing blood to gush out like a fountain.</p>
