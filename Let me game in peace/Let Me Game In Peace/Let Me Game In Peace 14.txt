<h3 id='chapter1300'>Chapter 1300: Wings of Tomorrow</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Since he couldn’t contact Wang Mingyuan, Zhou Wen had no solution. He felt that there was something fishy about this matter. If Jing Daoxian had really made a bet with Wang Mingyuan, there was no reason for Jing Daoxian to come looking for him, but he had heard nothing from Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to put this matter aside. He planned on testing the Wings of Tomorrow skill and see what it was all about.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew very well that a Terror-grade skill wasn’t likely to be able to travel into the future. Ignoring tomorrow, even a minute into the future was unlikely.</p>
<p>He used Wings of Tomorrow and felt a force spew out from his back. Like a rocket’s thruster, it pushed his body up.</p>
<p>The altitude he could fly was very low, like a swallow’s low flight, but it was very fast.</p>
<p>Such a speed was extremely fast even at the Terror grade. It wasn’t slower than Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>Is that all? Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed. Although such speed was fast, it was no different from his Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to stop, but he was suddenly alarmed to discover that he couldn’t stop the Essence Energy circulation in his body. The Wings of Tomorrow seemed to lose control as it carried him forward like a cannonball.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly circulated his Essence Energy Art in a bid to stop his body’s flight.</p>
<p>A huge mountain appeared in his vision. At this speed, he would crash into it in less than a minute.</p>
<p>However, the more Zhou Wen circulated his Essence Energy, the faster he flew. It was as though his Essence Energy would automatically be absorbed by the Wings of the Tomorrow. Not only could he not stop it, but he also aided it.</p>
<p>Seeing that he couldn’t stop, Zhou Wen attempted to change his flight path. At the very least, he couldn’t let himself crash into the mountain.</p>
<p>The outcome was the same. After trying several methods, his body continued flying straight forward. He was getting closer and closer to the mountain, and the granite wall was right in front of him.</p>
<p>Gritting his teeth, Zhou Wen released the Seven Seas Dragon King and placed it in front of him, hoping to use its body to buffer the collision.</p>
<p>The Seven Seas Dragon King spewed out white mucus at Zhou Wen, hoping to stop him from continuing his flight. When the white mucus landed on Zhou Wen, his body rushed through it without it sticking to him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and prepared to slam into the Seven Seas Dragon King, but his vision blurred as his body tunneled through its body and headed straight for the mountain wall.</p>
<p>“Stop!” Zhou Wen brandished his fist and struck the mountain in front of him.</p>
<p>However, he realized that all the Essence Energy in his body had been drained by the Wings of the Tomorrow. Without any Essence Energy to provide his other skills, his body continued on its collision course.</p>
<p>It’s over! Am I going to be the first human to kill himself with his own skill? Zhou Wen was so depressed that he nearly vomited blood.</p>
<p>However, his flying speed was too fast. Without giving him any time to think, he had already slammed into the mountain wall.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen subconsciously closed his eyes and gathered all his strength, preparing to withstand the pain of the collision, but the pain didn’t come.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen opened his eyes and realized that he was tunneling through the mountain. The strange scene was somewhat similar to the Earth Elemental Beast’s Earth Escape technique.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t tell if the mountain had turned into an illusion or if his body had turned into an illusion. When the two overlapped, there was no collision. It was like the images projected by two projectors. They overlapped and changed, but they didn’t collide.</p>
<p>What’s going on? The power of the Wings of Tomorrow? Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>His body kept flying forward, unable to stop. He charged through the mountain, the forest, and even a dam.</p>
<p>However, none of this could touch Zhou Wen’s body. Zhou Wen’s body appeared to be an incorporeal ghost. He could pass through anything he touched.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen discovered something even more terrifying. As he couldn’t control his body, he naturally couldn’t choose a flight path and slammed straight into a dimensional zone.</p>
<p>This dimensional zone was deep in the mountains, and Zhou Wen had never been there before. It didn’t seem like anyone had come here. He saw groups of strange dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>They looked like cats, but their bodies were as large as tigers. They basked in the warm sun on the grass in groups, as though they couldn’t see Zhou Wen flying over their heads.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen flew through the dimensional zone. The dimensional zone didn’t restrict his body, so he didn’t need to take the main entrance.</p>
<p>Wings of Tomorrow is quite interesting. Could it be that I’m using tomorrow’s body to do something today, that’s why I’m not affected? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Even tomorrow’s body couldn’t pass through the mountain wall without a collision. The mountain wall had been there for hundreds of millions of years and it would continue to exist for a long time into the future. Be it yesterday or tomorrow, it was impossible for it to suddenly vanish. It was impossible for him to pass through it no matter when.</p>
<p>What’s going on with this skill? Could it be that I have to fly like this until tomorrow? The possibility only made him even more depressed.</p>
<p>He kept flying as his body passed through dimensional zones one after another. He flew for a long time in the dimensional zones. Due to his extreme speed, it didn’t take long for him to pass through ordinary zones. Therefore, Zhou Wen had the illusion that he was flying continuously in dimensional zones.</p>
<p>In those dimensional zones, Zhou Wen saw terrifying snakes that resembled dragons, behemoths that were as large as mountains, and strange treants.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was quite knowledgeable. He had experienced many dimensional zones and seen many dimensional creatures, but the number of dimensional creatures he had seen today was more than in his previous years combined.</p>
<p>Thankfully, no matter what dimensional zone he entered, the Wings of Tomorrow would fly past it with Zhou Wen appearing like a ghost without attracting the attention of any creatures.</p>
<p>Although I don’t know what’s up with this skill, it seems interesting. If this move can’t even be discovered by a Calamity-grade creature, can I use it to get a ranking on Venus? Zhou Wen was already somewhat relaxed.</p>
<p>Since no one could discover him and he didn’t have to worry about hitting anything while he just kept flying, apart from physically moving, it didn’t seem to affect him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen even had the urge to take out his phone and game while flying, but before he could really take it out, he suddenly heard a bang.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>He felt as though his head was about to explode from the collision. His entire body bounced back as his head spun. His head buzzed as he nearly fainted on the spot.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen finally regained clarity of mind, his vision was still blurry.. He tried his best to widen his eyes, hoping to figure out where he was.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1301'>Chapter 1301: Accidentally Entering a Land of Peril</h3>
<p>As if he had suddenly plunged into the sun from the darkness, Zhou Wen’s vision became clearer. However, the scene in front of him made his hair stand up, and he had goosebumps all over his body.</p>
<p>Swoosh!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen quickly jumped up and retreated like a cat whose tail had been stepped on.</p>
<p>In front of him was a creature bigger than a tyrannosaurus. It was a white-furred ape. Its fur was snow-white, but its skin was as black as cast iron.</p>
<p>It was probably more than a hundred meters tall and unimaginably muscular. Its hands were raised high as if it were holding something, like a giant that could hold up the sky.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what level it was at, but he had most likely stopped from slamming into it. He had passed through so many places, but he couldn’t make the Wings of Tomorrow stop. Yet, when he slammed into it, he almost blew up his head. However, it was completely fine. Just its physical strength alone proved how extraordinary it was.</p>
<p>At this moment, the white ape was staring at Zhou Wen with a gaze like a demon king looking at a mortal.</p>
<p>Alarmed, Zhou Wen retreated quickly. However, he didn’t retreat far before he bumped into something and had to stop.</p>
<p>As Wings of Tomorrow had been interrupted, Zhou Wen regained control of his body. With this collision, he felt something soft behind him as if he had slammed into a soft animal. He was so frightened that he immediately retreated again.</p>
<p>He turned around and saw a golden glow behind him. It was a leg, a leg covered in golden fur.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked up and quickly saw the owner of the leg. It was also a giant ape with a body comparable to the white ape. However, it was covered in golden hair that resembled satin, and its skin was yellow.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen had bumped into it, its golden crystal-like eyes stared at Zhou Wen like the white ape. There was an extremely cold look in its eyes.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I’ll definitely watch where I’m going next time.” Zhou Wen turned around and wanted to run to the side, but he realized that there was also a giant ape there. The hair on that giant ape was blackish-gray, making it look even more terrifying.</p>
<p>“No way…” Zhou Wen swept his gaze around. Just as he imagined, there was a giant ape in all four directions. In the other direction was a giant ape with red fur. Like the other three giant apes, they raised their hands as if they were holding something. They stood there motionless as they looked at him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen forced himself to calm down and carefully sized up the four apes and the situation.</p>
<p>That glance left him even more confused and horrified.</p>
<p>This was a huge underground cave. There was actually a lot of seawater around it, like an underground sea.</p>
<p>The spot where Zhou Wen was standing wasn’t a small island, but a gigantic turtle shell.</p>
<p>The four giant apes stood on the turtle shell. Their hands were raised high as they collectively held up a stone-like object.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t tell what it was. It was carved from gray stone and looked very crude. It looked a little like a tripod, but it was too large.</p>
<p>The four giant apes were more than 100 meters tall. It was obvious how large the stone artifact was if lifting it required their combined strength.</p>
<p>What was even stranger was that Zhou Wen realized that there was an iron collar around each ape’s neck. The collar was connected to several chains, linking their bodies to the turtle shell and the stone artifact.</p>
<p>What kind of place is this? Zhou Wen took a Rejuvenation Pill and felt his mind clear up. He was even more shocked and confused.</p>
<p>The reason for that was because he discovered a stone cocoon in the stone artifact.</p>
<p>Guardian! There’s actually a Guardian here! Zhou Wen used Truth Listener and scanned the stone cocoon in the stone artifact repeatedly. There was indeed no mistake; it was indeed a Guardian cocoon.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was very curious, he knew very well that the four devil-like apes were definitely not benevolent creatures. Furthermore, he didn’t make a habit of risking his life.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen used Godfiend Era’s instant transmission to escape.</p>
<p>However, he was clearly moving toward the underground sea, but he still appeared above the turtle shell.</p>
<p>The results were the same after a few attempts. Be it instant transmission or Singularity Universe’s interstellar teleportation abilities, Zhou Wen would appear on the turtle shell when he blinked out of existence.</p>
<p>Apes are vegetarians, right? They shouldn’t want to eat human flesh, right? Zhou Wen looked at the four apes and carefully walked through the gap between one of the apes’ legs. He wanted to see if he could directly walk beyond the turtle shell.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen walked, he kept sizing up the golden-haired ape. The golden-haired ape looked the most amiable out of the four apes. Zhou Wen thought that it might not like eating meat.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen moved, the four giant apes didn’t move, but their eyes kept following his movements. The golden-furred ape was no exception.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen braced himself and prepared to walk between the golden-haired ape’s legs. He gathered all his strength. If the golden-haired ape suddenly attacked, he could only risk it.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen didn’t like to participate in battles with such unknowns, he knew that it was best to take the initiative when facing an unknown opponent.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen had already made a plan. As long as the ape did not do anything abnormal, he would immediately attack with all his might and finish off one first.</p>
<p>Rumble!</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could reach the golden-furred ape’s legs, he suddenly felt the turtle shell beneath his feet tremble. The seawater around him churned as if something had happened.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen quickly summoned his Terror-level Companion Beasts and surrounded himself with them.</p>
<p>There were Golden Battle Gods around him, and Banana Fairy was sitting on a banana leaf above him. He also carried Demonic Neonate in his arms, prepared to fight to the death at any moment.</p>
<p>The surrounding seawater churned for a while, but it didn’t affect the turtle shell. After a while, the turtle shell stopped trembling, and the seawater gradually calmed down.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was wondering what had happened, he suddenly saw the golden-furred ape lower one of its claws and use only one claw to hold up the stone artifact.</p>
<p>The lowered claw swiped at the sea.</p>
<p>With a boom, the seawater thousands of meters away spewed out. A flood dragon broke out of the water like a loach that had been caught. Its body twisted and struggled, but it couldn’t escape.</p>
<p>The flood dragon was pulled into the golden-furred ape’s claw from thousands of meters away.</p>
<p>The flood dragon’s body spewed out dragon breath. Its strength was probably not inferior to the True Blood Demon Dragon, but it was like a loach in front of the golden-furred ape. It grabbed the flood dragon by the mouth and bit down. The dragon’s head, together with a small portion of its body, was bitten off. With a few bites, the dragon’s blood gushed out and the dragon bones broke.</p>
<p>In just a moment, a flood dragon was swallowed alive and whole, into the golden ape’s stomach.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1302'>Chapter 1302: Four Dimitrios Monkeys</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen felt his scalp tingle. Although there were indeed many creatures that ate dragons in the ancient myths of the East District, hearing about them and seeing them with his own eyes were two different matters.</p>
<p>Having seen a flood dragon being eaten alive, Zhou Wen’s hopes of a vegetarian ape were dashed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen knew that he couldn’t pull a living flood dragon out of the deep sea.</p>
<p>The golden-haired ape was already so terrifying, but there were four of such monkeys here. Zhou Wen felt that things were going south now that he was being watched by four terrifying apes while he was under their noses.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the four terrifying apes hadn’t attacked him yet.</p>
<p>I have to think of a way to leave this godforsaken place. Zhou Wen looked at the golden-haired ape’s legs, but he didn’t have the courage to run through them.</p>
<p>They still had no intention of taking action. Perhaps they planned on storing him as food. If their food were to escape, they might be displeased.</p>
<p>Who wouldn’t feel the pinch after losing more than fifty kilograms of meat? Anyway, Zhou Wen didn’t dare take the risk or rashly move about. Even with the four Golden Battle Gods surrounding him and Banana Fairy overseeing him, Zhou Wen still didn’t feel safe.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen staying motionless, the four terrifying apes didn’t move either. They just stared at him as though they had no intention of attacking.</p>
<p>Could it be that they really plan on storing me as food? That’s not right. I’m only a tiny bit of meat to them. I’m probably not even enough to fill the gaps between their teeth. A flood dragon has been eaten up in one go. What’s the point with storing a pittance like me? Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>If I had known, I would have brought Ice Maiden over. We would have been able to negotiate. Perhaps she knows what the four apes are. Zhou Wen regretted leaving Ice Maiden and Nether Lotus in Luoyang.</p>
<p>In the myths and legends of the East District, there were many apes. The most famous one was naturally the Handsome Monkey King that wreaked havoc in the Heavenly Palace.</p>
<p>However, these four apes had looks which had nothing to do with beauty.</p>
<p>The Handsome Monkey King was an Intelligent Stone Monkey, and among the Four Dimitrios Monkeys, there were also the Six-Eared Macaque, Long-Armed Ape Monkey, and Red-Bottomed Horse Monkey. There were also four apes here, so Zhou Wen couldn’t help but think of the Four Dimitrios Monkeys.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully sized them up, hoping to see if he could find the characteristics of the Four Dimitrios Monkeys on them.</p>
<p>After some observation, he failed to discover any ape with especially long arms, nor did he discover any ape with six ears.</p>
<p>These four apes don’t seem to be the Four Dimitrios Monkeys. Furthermore, I’ve never heard of monkeys standing on a turtle’s back holding a stone artifact in myths. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be curious when he thought of the stone artifact.</p>
<p>These four apes were definitely at the Terror grade or even stronger. How powerful was the Guardian cocoon they protected?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously heard that there were still differences between Guardians. Some Guardians’ potential might be at the Terror grade, making it difficult for them to advance any further. As for other Guardians, they might reach the Calamity grade or even the Apocalypse grade.</p>
<p>And according to An Sheng, the strangest point was that Guardians hatched from Earth all seemed to have considerable potential.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Guardians that were directly teleported over from the dimension were at the Terror grade when they arrived—they didn’t seem to have any room for growth. Their strength would basically stagnate. Advancing to a higher grade wasn’t even the main problem—there were very few examples of them undergoing slight improvements.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen had always been unsure of the relationship between Guardians and the dimensional creatures. Most of the Guardian cocoons on Earth had a powerful dimensional creature guarding them.</p>
<p>However, having seen so many Guardian cocoons, Zhou Wen felt that the dimensional creatures weren’t just simply protecting it.</p>
<p>Just like when he went to contract Fairy Burial with Jiang Yan, the dimensional creature suspected to be Bai Ze didn’t seem to care too much about the Fairy Burial he was protecting and easily gave up.</p>
<p>Of course, he couldn’t rule out the possibility that Bai Ze was seriously obsessed with cleanliness and had to leave because he was disgusted by the two of them.</p>
<p>Without anyone else to discuss it with, Zhou Wen got Demonic Neonate to release Grim Demon. This fellow was rather knowledgeable, so he might be able to recognize the four monkeys.</p>
<p>Even if he couldn’t recognize the monkeys, as a Guardian, he might be able to tell something from the Guardian cocoon.</p>
<p>“It’s so boring. Can you let me come out more often in the future? After all, I was once…” After Grim Demon came out, he protested unhappily. However, when he saw the scene in front of him, he halted the words he was about to say. He wore a look of horror and quickly retreated, hoping to return to the demonic sword.</p>
<p>However, without Demonic Neonate’s orders, how could he return?</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, you know these four monkeys?” Zhou Wen was delighted and shocked when he saw Grim Demon’s reaction.</p>
<p>He was delighted that Grim Demon seemed to know them. He was shocked because Grim Demon’s reaction undoubtedly meant that the four monkeys were terrifying existences. It seemed even more difficult for him to escape alive.</p>
<p>Grim Demon stood there with a nasty expression. Although his legs weren’t trembling, it was obvious that his legs were a little limp.</p>
<p>“Why did you come to such a godforsaken place? Can’t you just lead a peaceful life?” Grim Demon had always been considered Demonic Neonate the boss, while he was second. He thought nothing of anything else. For him to speak in such a tone now made Zhou Wen feel even more uneasy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, Do you think I’m willing to come to such a godforsaken place? No matter how free I am, wouldn’t it be nice if I just stayed at home and gamed? Who wants to come here to die? I didn’t expect that darn Wings of Tomorrow to be so strange.</p>
<p>“Cut the crap. What are these four monkeys?” Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t tell Grim Demon that he had used a skill to get himself into such a situation. It would be too embarrassing.</p>
<p>Grim Demon said gloomily, “I don’t know what they are, but I’m certain that they are Calamity-grade creatures or worse.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>“The collars and chains on their bodies are clearly a form of imprisonment. Their strength must have been suppressed, but even so, the Essence Energy fluctuations they emit are still at the Calamity grade. I really don’t know if they will become stronger if they aren’t suppressed…” As Grim Demon spoke, he sized up the four apes from time to time. He looked a little afraid.</p>
<p>“Are you saying that they are at the Apocalypse level?” Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>“I’m just saying that it’s possible. It’s not that easy to reach the Apocalypse stage, but they are definitely top existences among Calamity-grade existences,” Grim Demon explained.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression became even more complicated. Top Calamity creatures were chained here to guard a Guardian cocoon; that meant that the Guardian cocoon was definitely extraordinary.</p>
<p>In any case, Zhou Wen had never seen a Guardian cocoon with such a luxurious lineup of defenders.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1303'>Chapter 1303: Strange Guardian Cocoon</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>For some reason, the ape that could swallow a flood dragon only stared at Zhou Wen without taking action.</p>
<p>Although they didn’t move, Zhou Wen still felt uneasy. He felt like an infant that had fallen into a tiger’s den and was surrounded by a group of tigers.</p>
<p>Grim Demon was also trembling in fear. Although he said that he was fearless, he was only at the Terror grade. There was no way to compete with an existence at the level of the Four Monkeys.</p>
<p>The ignorant were fearless. The more one knew about something, the more they would feel reverence.</p>
<p>Grim Demon was clearly a knowledgeable person. He knew how terrifying the four ferocious monkeys were.</p>
<p>“Do you recognize the Guardian cocoon’s species?” Zhou Wen asked Grim Demon.</p>
<p>Grim Demon was slightly taken aback. Under Zhou Wen’s instructions, he realized that there was a Guardian cocoon inside the stone artifact.</p>
<p>“Strange!” Grim Demon didn’t dare approach to take a look. He only peeked from below, but his expression became puzzled.</p>
<p>“What’s strange?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Grim Demon frowned and said, “That Guardian cocoon is a little strange. Typically, a Guardian cocoon that hasn’t hatched will be sent to a dimensional zone that matches its stats after being teleported to Earth. The power of the dimensional zone will have a certain effect on the Guardian cocoon, causing the Guardian’s growth to undergo a certain mutation. However, it won’t change his fundamental stats.”</p>
<p>“For example, if it’s a Guardian created from the genes of the angels, no matter how this Guardian mutates, be it into a fire-elemental angel or ice-elemental angel, he will still be in an angel form.” Grim Demon continued with an odd expression, “But this Companion Beast is somewhat different.”</p>
<p>“What’s different? Do you know what species the Guardian in the cocoon is?” Zhou Wen was spying on the Guardian cocoon, but he couldn’t see anything.</p>
<p>Grim Demon shook his head slightly. “I can’t see what’s inside the cocoon either. However, the power from the cocoon is clearly incompatible with the power attributes of this dimensional zone. Didn’t you notice?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously felt that the Guardian cocoon was somewhat strange, but he had been thinking of a way to escape without thinking too much about other things. Now that Grim Demon had mentioned it, he realized that the attributes of the Guardian cocoon were indeed somewhat incompatible with the attributes of this dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Although he couldn’t tell what attributes the Guardian cocoon had, it repelled the Essence Energy in the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Grim Demon looked at the four apes and continued, “Furthermore, typically speaking, the dimensional creatures that stay beside the Guardian cocoon do so voluntarily. As for these four fellows, they seem to be chained here and have no choice but to guard this Guardian cocoon. Such a situation definitely has a special reason.”</p>
<p>“What could be the reason?” Zhou Wen didn’t know much about Guardians, so he could only ask Grim Demon.</p>
<p>Grim Demon shook his head. “There might be many reasons. Perhaps someone didn’t want this Guardian cocoon to hatch, so they sealed it in a place that doesn’t match the Guardian cocoon’s attributes to prevent it from hatching. The four apes might be used to prevent someone from contracting the Guardian cocoon or taking it away. It’s also possible that there’s something special about this Guardian cocoon such as it being only hatchable in such a place. There’s also a possibility that someone found this Guardian cocoon elsewhere and moved it here…”</p>
<p>Grim Demon listed a few possibilities, but he couldn’t determine which one it was.</p>
<p>“Someone imprisoned four Calamity-grade creatures and placed the Guardian cocoon in such a place. With such strength, it’s unlikely he’s human, right?” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“That might not be the case. During the war in ancient times, there were quite a number of humans who reached the Calamity grade by combining with Guardians. There was even…” Grim Demon suddenly seemed to realize something and shut up.</p>
<p>“There was even an Apocalypse grade?” Zhou Wen sized up Grim Demon with interest. He had previously had the notion that Grim Demon might not be purely arrogant. Now, from the looks of it, he knew many things. It was very likely that he was a powerful Guardian that had survived the ancient era.</p>
<p>“I heard so.” Grim Demon was clearly being patronizing.</p>
<p>Seeing that Grim Demon had no intention of continuing, Zhou Wen didn’t press further. Instead, he asked, “Then, do you think that this Guardian cocoon might be a Guardian that survived the ancient era?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t seem like it. This should be a Guardian cocoon that hasn’t hatched.” After a pause, Grim Demon continued, “However, it’s really possible that it was left behind from that era. Only an environment like this allows one to not hatch after such a long period of time.”</p>
<p>“How long ago was the ancient era you mentioned?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“To you humans, it’s the prehistoric Mythical Era.” Grim Demon suddenly frowned and said, “Strange!”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Did you discover anything special?” Zhou Wen didn’t see anything amiss. The four ferocious apes were still staring at them without doing anything different.</p>
<p>“It’s just that it’s strange that there’s nothing special about it. Regardless of the possibility, these four fellows were chained here to guard this Guardian cocoon. We’ve been here for so long, but they haven’t reacted at all. This is too strange,” Grim Demon said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously found it odd that they were here to protect the Guardian cocoon, but they ignored him, an intruder. This was clearly odd.</p>
<p>“Could it be that they have been suppressed for too long and have lost the ability to attack?” Grim Demon pondered out loud.</p>
<p>“I saw with my own eyes that the golden-haired ape grabbed the air with one hand and sucked a flood dragon out of the sea. Then, it chewed it alive.” Zhou Wen rejected Grim Demon’s theory.</p>
<p>“That’s strange. Then why don’t they attack us? That doesn’t make sense.” Grim Demon frowned.</p>
<p>“Could it be that they are restricted by some taboo power and are unable to attack creatures on the turtle shell?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Impossible. No one is that foolish. Unless…” Grim Demon seemed to think of a possibility, but he was somewhat unsure.</p>
<p>“Unless what?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Unless there’s someone among us who can hatch the Guardian cocoon and meet the requirements of the person who designed all of this; only then will they not attack.” The person Grim Demon was referring to was naturally Zhou Wen. He was the only human here.</p>
<p>“No way?” Zhou Wen found it unbelievable. How could it be so coincidental that he met the conditions for hatching the Guardian cocoon?</p>
<p>“Apart from that, I really can’t think of any other possibility.” The more Grim Demon thought about it, the more he felt that it was right. He said to Zhou Wen, “You don’t have to belittle yourself. To be able to obtain Master’s favor, you aren’t too bad. Perhaps it’s really possible.”</p>
<p>No matter how Zhou Wen tried to interpret Grim Demon’s words, something seemed amiss.. It sounded like he was praising him, but it also didn’t feel right.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1304'>Chapter 1304: Give it a try</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen thought about it and felt that it was true.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t met the requirements, how could these ferocious beasts ignore him?</p>
<p>Since their mission here was to protect the Guardian cocoon, be it voluntary or not, the person who designed all of this definitely had a way to make them eliminate anyone who came here.</p>
<p>Up to now, they had no intention of attacking him. Grim Demon’s words seemed to make sense.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t lose his rationality because of Grim Demon’s speculation. He felt that it was only a possibility. If he guessed wrongly and randomly touched the Guardian cocoon, the apes who had no intention of killing him might immediately turn hostile.</p>
<p>However, being trapped here wasn’t a solution. Zhou Wen planned on probing the way.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen summoned a Poison Bat and got it to fly towards the gap between the golden-haired ape and the black-gray ape.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was extremely nervous and his nerves were taut. If the Poison Bat angered the four apes, he could only fight to the death. He might have to use the Immortal Culling Sword again.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t know if it could kill the four apes. After all, he was too weak. He could only use the most basic ability of the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>Thankfully, what Zhou Wen was worried about didn’t happen. The Poison Bat flew out of the turtle shell’s range without the four apes attacking it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted when he saw this. He got the Poison Bat to scout the sea surface and made it fly a distance away. The four apes still didn’t react.</p>
<p>There’s a chance! Zhou Wen was still worried as he experimented with a few different Companion Beasts. The outcome was the same. They ignored him.</p>
<p>Even Jade Rabbit was released by Zhou Wen. The fellow ran and hopped across the sea, but the four apes didn’t attack it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt relieved as he attempted to walk out.</p>
<p>God bless me. If I can return safely this time, I guarantee that I’ll offer three incense sticks every day and do the ritual of bathing and eating vegetarian food for a month… Zhou Wen felt uneasy.</p>
<p>Although the four apes didn’t attack him, their eyes followed his path.</p>
<p>“It’s fine looking as long as you don’t attack. We are all gentlemen here. A gentleman uses his tongue, not his fists… Pui… Don’t use your tongue either…” Zhou Wen suddenly thought of the flood dragon’s outcome and hurriedly changed his words.</p>
<p>Slowly, he took three steps. Zhou Wen carefully moved out as he observed the four apes’ reactions. If they had any nasty reaction, Zhou Wen would immediately stop and think of another solution.</p>
<p>However, the four apes didn’t react. They just watched him slowly move.</p>
<p>Grim Demon, who was following Zhou Wen, couldn’t help but break out into a cold sweat. If it was different from what he had guessed, resulting in the angering of the four apes, their outcome would probably be tragic.</p>
<p>Finally, Zhou Wen walked to the golden-haired ape’s side and walked past its legs. He finally left the island-like turtle shell.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen flew to the surface of the sea, feeling delighted. He didn’t care if he met the requirements. Since he could come out, he had to escape.</p>
<p>Due to the earlier lesson, Zhou Wen didn’t dare use instant transmission. He was afraid that he would return to the turtle shell. He summoned his Companion Beasts and Jade Rabbit back before using the Transcendent Flying Immortal movement technique to transform into a stream of light and flew into the distance. In the blink of an eye, he flew thousands of meters away.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was feeling excited that he had finally escaped. All he needed to do was leave this dimensional zone.</p>
<p>However, just as he smiled, he suddenly felt the world spin. When he snapped to his senses, he realized that he was on a furry claw.</p>
<p>The owner of the claw was the black-gray-haired ape.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed. He had clearly sensed spatial powers. Furthermore, it was a spatial power that was at a higher level than his Singularity Universe and Godfiend Era.</p>
<p>To be able to teleport something from thousands of meters away was no mean feat—it was something Zhou Wen couldn’t do.</p>
<p>Even if he used Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping, he had to leave a mark. Yet, the black-gray ape had teleported him into its palm. This was much harder than Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was a living person with Terror-grade strength—a person who was good at spatial powers. He wasn’t that easily transported.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen already had plans to fight for his life. He quickly flew out of the ape claw and grabbed the hilt of Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>However, the black-gray ape had no intention of continuing. It retracted its claw and returned to the stance of raising the stone artifact with both claws.</p>
<p>This left Zhou Wen taken aback as he thought to himself, What’s the meaning of this? He captured me and ignored me. Could it be that he feels too bored being trapped here and wants me to stay behind to chat?</p>
<p>“Um… Brother Ape… Do you need any help? Just say the word and I’ll do my best,” Zhou Wen probed the four apes.</p>
<p>No one answered him. The four apes didn’t seem to hear him at all. They continued standing there expressionlessly, staring at him as before.</p>
<p>What’s the meaning of this? Don’t you want to talk to me? Could it be that Grim Demon was right? I’m a person who meets the requirements. I have to contract the Guardian before I can leave? Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and tried to leave the turtle shell again.</p>
<p>The four apes still didn’t stop him, but when he wanted to leave, he was caught by the black-gray ape again.</p>
<p>The black-gray ape’s spatial technique was much better than Zhou Wen and Liu Yun’s. It was clearly on a higher level.</p>
<p>You aren’t letting me leave, nor do you kill me; yet you allow me to leave the turtle shell. From the looks of it, it’s very likely that they want me to contract the Guardian… Zhou Wen felt somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>He guessed that once the Guardian was contracted and hatched, the four apes would be liberated. It wasn’t easy for them to encounter a human that met the requirements, so they had to keep him behind.</p>
<p>“My dear ape brothers, do you want me to contract the Guardian in the cocoon?” Zhou Wen asked again as he stared at them, hoping to figure out something.</p>
<p>However, they remained silent without any expression. They looked like old monks in meditation. Apart from staring at Zhou Wen, they didn’t do anything else.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could tell that the four of them thought nothing of him. They had no intention of communicating with him.</p>
<p>Since they don’t seem to want me dead, I’ll give it a try. Zhou Wen left the turtle shell again and flew out from the middle of the four apes. However, this time, he didn’t escape. Instead, he flew towards the stone artifact.</p>
<p>When he arrived above the stone artifact, he saw the Guardian cocoon inside with his own eyes. The Guardian cocoon was also a piece of rock, about the same color as the stone artifact. If one didn’t look carefully, they would mistake the stone as part of the stone artifact.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1305'>Chapter 1305: Forced Contract</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen landed on the edge of the stone artifact and glanced at the four apes. They didn’t move at all, as though they didn’t mind in the least about Zhou Wen’s actions.</p>
<p>“Do you really want me to contract the Guardian?” Zhou Wen looked at the stone cocoon in the stone artifact as his expression changed.</p>
<p>Contracting a Guardian wasn’t difficult. As long as one reached the Guardian’s requirement for physique, one only needed a drop of blood to complete the contract.</p>
<p>Even if he couldn’t meet the Guardian’s requirements, as long as the Guardian was willing, he could still contract it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in contracting a Guardian. He even felt averse to it. After all, Guardians were tools used by the dimension to colonize Earth.</p>
<p>It was a little similar to cyborgs that humans had once imagined. Contracting such a creature might result in betrayal at any time. It wasn’t a pleasant feeling.</p>
<p>It was mainly because Zhou Wen had too many secrets. If the Guardian learned of such a secret and informed the dimension, who knew what the dimension would do to him.</p>
<p>If there was another way, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have contracted a Guardian. Even if he wanted to, it had to be a master-slave contract like Demonic Neonate and Grim Demon.</p>
<p>However, now that Zhou Wen thought about it, there didn’t seem to be any other way. This dimensional zone was very strange. It didn’t seem like he could leave without making a contract.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that if he could leave, he could just contract it. After all, the Guardian contract was an equal contract. He could escape first and think of a way to terminate the contract later.</p>
<p>This was the good thing about an equal contract. It wasn’t particularly difficult to remove it. He could still come up with something.</p>
<p>Staying alive comes first. With this in mind, Zhou Wen skillfully condensed a finger beam and stabbed a needle-like wound on the finger of his other hand. He squeezed out a drop of blood and prepared to drip it onto the stone cocoon.</p>
<p>Before he dripped his blood, Zhou Wen specially glanced at the four apes below. Seeing that they had no intention of stopping him, he steeled his heart and dripped the blood onto the stone cocoon.</p>
<p>Sigh, I was forced. I didn’t really want to contract a Guardian. Ancestors, please don’t blame me. If you want to blame someone, blame the genes you handed me for being too outstanding, Zhou Wen thought plaintively.</p>
<p>Blood had already dripped onto the stone cocoon. It was too late for regrets.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, Zhou Wen awkwardly realized that when his blood landed on the cocoon, it was as though water droplets had landed on a pot of oil. It slid down without touching the cocoon at all.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gaped in shock.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Didn’t you want me to contract it? When Zhou Wen gradually calmed down, he was even more puzzled.</p>
<p>If he wasn’t the one to make the contract, why did they get him to come up here? The four apes had clearly agreed for him to be there. To have such a performance meant that they thought highly of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, his blood was completely unable to trigger a reaction from the Guardian cocoon. This meant that he hadn’t obtained the recognition of the Guardian cocoon. Or rather, his bloodline and stats couldn’t meet the Guardian’s requirements.</p>
<p>Could it be that the four apes were mistaken? Zhou Wen thought to himself, but when he looked at the four apes, he felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen were one of those apes, he would probably have swallowed him to prevent himself from being embarrassed. However, the apes didn’t have such plans. They continued waiting for something.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Zhou Wen sized up the stone cocoon again. On careful look, he realized that the stone cocoon was indeed different.</p>
<p>Previously, Zhou Wen had discovered that there were faint gray patterns on the stone cocoon’s surface. They didn’t look eye-catching and he couldn’t see them without careful inspection. Zhou Wen had thought that the gray patterns were natural patterns of the stone cocoon.</p>
<p>Now, after taking a closer look, he realized that it didn’t seem to be the case. He realized that the gray patterns had been drawn by someone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what kind of paint it was. It was gray like burnt paper ash. It was very closely connected to the stone cocoon and the color was similar. That is why he had thought they were part of the stone cocoon.</p>
<p>However, on careful observation, he realized that there were many spots where the gray patterns were drawn with a brush. It was the same kind of brush used in the East District’s ancient times. The paintings also looked a little like ink paintings, but they were much lighter. It was as though they had been gone through the ravages of time and were about to become indiscernible.</p>
<p>Drawing on the Guardian cocoon? Zhou Wen felt that this wasn’t the doing of someone who had nothing better to do. The paintings on it likely had some use.</p>
<p>He circled the edge of the stone artifact and carefully studied the gray patterns on the Guardian cocoon. Although they were very faint, he could roughly see them.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t understand it. He realized that the gray patterns were a strange symbol. It was like a series of encryption numbers that filled the entire Guardian cocoon’s surface.</p>
<p>The symbols were unfamiliar. In any case, they weren’t words or symbols that Zhou Wen knew.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that the symbols were like chains that circled around the stone cocoon as though they were sealing it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen guessed inwardly, Could it be that these gray patterns are sealing the stone cocoon, preventing my blood from being absorbed by it?</p>
<p>The more he thought about it, the more convinced he was. Zhou Wen planned on giving it a try to see if he could wipe off the gray pattern before trying to contract it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was afraid that touching the stone cocoon would anger the apes, so he asked, “My dear ape brothers, is the plan to get me to wipe away the gray patterns before contracting the Guardian cocoon?”</p>
<p>However, they remained silent as though they hadn’t heard Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>These four fellows are too detestable. They clearly want me to do something, but they don’t say a word or express anything. Zhou Wen wished he could kill them all. It was best if four Companion Eggs dropped.</p>
<p>In the future, he would buy a car without wheels and get the four of them to carry him every day.</p>
<p>Despite his thoughts, Zhou Wen felt that he could give it a try seeing that they didn’t react. Therefore, he carefully flew into the stone artifact and slowly approached the stone cocoon.</p>
<p>As he flew, he paid attention to their reactions. Seeing that they had no intention of stopping him, Zhou Wen finally landed on the stone cocoon.</p>
<p>This stone cocoon was about four to five meters in diameter. It wasn’t small, and it was unknown what kind of Guardian was inside. Since there were four apes guarding it, it was likely that there was a stone monkey inside.</p>
<p>The legendary Handsome Monkey King was said to have jumped out of a stone. Could this Guardian be the Handsome Monkey King? Zhou Wen was somewhat expectant.</p>
<p>As a person from the East District, there didn’t seem to be anyone who didn’t like the Handsome Monkey King. Among the Four Dimitrios Monkeys, it was much more famous than the others.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1306'>Chapter 1306: Shattering the Stone Cocoon</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen put on the Prisoned Dragon armor and landed on the stone cocoon. He didn’t sense any energy fluctuations, nor did the gray patterns react.</p>
<p>This made Zhou Wen doubt his judgment again. If the gray patterns really sealed the stone cocoon, there should be a protection mechanism. Now that there was no reaction, Zhou Wen felt uneasy.</p>
<p>He squatted down and bent down to stroke the stone cocoon. He had only wanted to wipe the dust so that he could observe the gray patterns more clearly, but when he stroked it, many of the gray patterns were wiped away. This gave Zhou Wen a fright.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed as he flew up again. He warily sized up the stone cocoon, the stone artifact, and the four apes.</p>
<p>He remembered watching some movies in the past. Once a seal was destroyed, the big boss inside would be released. At the same time, there would be some cool lighting effects. There might also be earthquakes and mountain crumbling.</p>
<p>However, after some observation from midair, nothing happened. The four apes didn’t react, and the stone cocoon remained very stable, just like before.</p>
<p>Are these gray patterns really seals? Why are they dropping the moment I wipe them? I didn’t use any strength! Zhou Wen wore an odd expression as he returned to the stone cocoon and attempted to wipe it.</p>
<p>The gray patterns looked like they were really just dust. They fell off easily without any effect.</p>
<p>After wiping a small area, the stone cocoon was already very clean. Zhou Wen dripped another drop of blood on it and thought to himself, It should work this time.</p>
<p>Swoosh!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s blood slid down again without any intention of seeping in.</p>
<p>The corners of Zhou Wen’s eyes twitched. This was completely different from what he had imagined.</p>
<p>I don’t believe it. Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and reached out to wipe the other gray patterns. As he wiped, he observed the reactions of the four apes and the Guardian cocoon.</p>
<p>There was no reaction at all. It made Zhou Wen suspect that the gray patterns were really just dust. They weren’t what Zhou Wen had imagined.</p>
<p>As the gray patterns were wiped away, neither the four apes nor the stone cocoon reacted. However, Zhou Wen suddenly felt that the Truth Listener earring was gradually heating up.</p>
<p>This heat was very strange. It was different from Truth Listener’s previous effects of converting curses into Essence Energy. Zhou Wen didn’t sense any converted Essence Energy from Truth Listener. Instead, Truth Listener itself conveyed its thoughts.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the stone cocoon in a daze before sensing Truth Listener’s thoughts.</p>
<p>Could it be that the four apes aren’t eyeing me, but Truth Listener? With this in mind, Zhou Wen summoned Truth Listener.</p>
<p>The petite Truth Listener that resembled a golden-silk monkey landed on the stone cocoon.</p>
<p>Without waiting for Zhou Wen to give the order, Truth Listener grabbed at the stone cocoon.</p>
<p>Its claws were extremely sharp. Even if it didn’t shatter the earrings, it still had the strength of a peak Mythical. However, when its claws touched the stone cocoon, there was a clang. Sparks flew between its nails and the stone cocoon, but it failed to leave any marks on it.</p>
<p>Truth Listener seemed to be in a hurry as it automatically shattered an earring without Zhou Wen’s order.</p>
<p>As the earring shattered, Truth Listener’s figure began to change. It became huge and ferocious, completely different from its adorable mini form.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Truth Listener attacked the stone cocoon again, but the outcome was the same. It didn’t leave any marks on the stone cocoon.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, he shattered the second earring. Truth Listener’s figure became even more ferocious and ghostly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched Truth Listener attack the stone cocoon. Although he didn’t know what was going on, he could tell that Truth Listener seemed to be very interested in the Guardian inside the cocoon.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t know if its interest was a blessing or a curse to the Guardian inside.</p>
<p>As Truth Listener attacked the stone cocoon, Zhou Wen observed the four apes below. Although the four apes remained motionless, their eyes were clearly different from before. They seemed to be glowing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, their gazes finally stopped staring at Zhou Wen. Instead, they stared at Truth Listener.</p>
<p>No, it should be said that they had been staring at Truth Listener from the beginning. However, Truth Listener had always been on Zhou Wen’s ear, so he mistakenly believed that they were looking at him.</p>
<p>I should have figured. Monkeys only know how to look at monkeys. How can they appreciate the beauty of humans? Zhou Wen rubbed his lips in a self-deprecating manner, feeling that his lips were a little dry.</p>
<p>In the past, Truth Listener would completely lose control only when it shattered more than four earrings. It would then refuse to listen to Zhou Wen’s orders.</p>
<p>However, this time, it shattered its earrings independently. This was unprecedented. After the earrings shattered, Zhou Wen felt his connection with Truth Listener weaken. He couldn’t help but worry.</p>
<p>If this continues, it will probably be difficult for me to unsummon Truth Listener if it completely loses control. Zhou Wen was hesitant about whether he should take the opportunity to forcefully unsummon Truth Listener.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The fourth earring shattered. Truth Listener was already as terrifying as an ancient demon god. Its strength instantly reached the peak of the Terror grade. It was just a sliver short of advancing to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>And this time, its claws finally penetrated the stone cocoon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw a golden light emit from the crack in the stone cocoon. The golden light was crystalline and pure, making him tremble.</p>
<p>Purity made one find something beautiful, but if it was too pure, it made one feel fear and evil.</p>
<p>For example, a pure-hearted parishioner would make others feel that she was good and kind, but if she treated the teachings as the only principle in the world, it would make one shudder.</p>
<p>The golden light in the cocoon gave Zhou Wen such a feeling. It was so pure that it made him feel afraid.</p>
<p>However, Truth Listener seemed to enjoy it. Its nostrils twitched as the golden light that seeped out of the stone cocoon’s cracks condensed towards its nostrils like smoke and was sucked in.</p>
<p>When the golden light entered Truth Listener’s body, the golden fur on its body seemed to come alive as it was covered in a layer of pure, glass-like golden light.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was surprised to discover that his connection with Truth Listener seemed to have recovered somewhat.</p>
<p>Truth Listener seems to be able to control its violent consciousness… Is it due to the golden light? Zhou Wen frowned as he looked at the golden light inside the cocoon. He didn’t know if it was a blessing or a curse.</p>
<p>As Truth Listener twitched its nose and sucked in the golden light that seeped out, it used its claws to crazily attack the stone cocoon. It widened the crack in the stone cocoon and the golden light that seeped out increased.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared at the crack, hoping to see what was inside.</p>
<p>However, other than the pure golden light, he couldn’t see anything. It was clearly a small space, but it was shockingly deep.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Truth Listener tore open a huge hole as its strong body burrowed into the cracked stone cocoon.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1307'>Chapter 1307: Breaking Out</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>The light inside came from the deep depths, but after Truth Listener entered, the light inside rapidly weakened.</p>
<p>Soon, the golden light inside the cocoon dimmed. Instead, the golden light over Truth Listener’s body intensified.</p>
<p>Under Great Brahma’s enhancement, Zhou Wen’s vision could already penetrate the golden light and see what was happening inside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw something in the golden light, but he didn’t see the Guardian he had imagined. All he saw was an eyeball, a golden crystal-like eyeball.</p>
<p>The golden light in the cocoon came from the golden eyeball.</p>
<p>The eyeball itself was so pure that it chilled one’s heart, as though it was the purest, most sanctified object in the world.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen stared at the eyeball, it moved as though it had sensed Zhou Wen’s gaze. The golden iris in it spun and looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>With just a glance, Zhou Wen felt as though all his clothes had been stripped off. He stood there like a nude model, allowing others to observe and paint. He subconsciously raised his hand to cover his vital spots.</p>
<p>Roar!</p>
<p>Truth Listener roared like thunder as golden light bloomed from its body. It extended its claws and grabbed at the golden eyeball.</p>
<p>However, the light outside the golden eyeball had almost solidified. The closer Truth Listener’s claws were to the eyeball, the slower its progress.</p>
<p>When it was nearly a foot away from the golden eyeball, its claws couldn’t advance any further.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The fifth earring on Truth Listener’s ear shattered as its claws continued forward. However, it only advanced about ten centimeters before its speed slowed down again. Finally, it couldn’t move at all.</p>
<p>Truth Listener’s last earring shattered and fell, turning into golden light that scattered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that Truth Listener’s six-ringed body didn’t continue expanding. Instead, it shrank significantly. The golden fur on its body emitted a resplendent and pure golden light that nearly condensed into something corporeal. It was like a Super Saiyan transformation.</p>
<p>Now, Truth Listener was only half a head taller than Zhou Wen. Its fingernails were like golden crystal daggers that tore through the golden light outside the eyeball and penetrated it.</p>
<p>As the golden eyeball was pierced, the golden light in the cocoon seemed to lose the power it relied on. Truth Listener gently inhaled and the light surged towards his nose like a tumultuous river.</p>
<p>However, this time, Truth Listener didn’t deliberately suck the golden light. It just sniffed the eyeball.</p>
<p>Truth Listener stabbed the eyeball using its middle finger’s nail as it held it in front of its nose and inhaled. It looked like Zhou Wen when he was eating skewers.</p>
<p>Then, Zhou Wen saw Truth Listener open its mouth and suck at the eyeball. After chewing a few times, it swallowed.</p>
<p>Following that, it opened its mouth and crazily sucked the golden light in the cocoon. In the blink of an eye, it had completely sucked the golden light inside dry. The golden light over its body had already reached a peak. The intense golden light prevented Zhou Wen from seeing it.</p>
<p>However, he could vaguely sense his connection with Truth Listener. Truth Listener didn’t completely lose control this time. It still maintained a weak connection.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>As the eyeball and the golden light were devoured by Truth Listener, cracks appeared on the stone artifact that contained the stone cocoon.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the stone artifact. The chains that were connected to the stone artifact, as well as the collars on the four apes’ bodies and the huge turtle shell beneath their feet, began to crack.</p>
<p>Roar!</p>
<p>The four apes roared excitedly in unison as they exerted strength with their eight claws. The stone artifact that was already covered in cracks instantly shattered, and the chains on their bodies broke inch by inch.</p>
<p>The sea and the entire underground space were affected by their powers. The seawater surged and the stone dome shattered. Sunlight shot into the sky as though it had broken the barrier between hell and the human world—sunlight entered hell.</p>
<p>The aura that erupted from the four apes was terrifying and unimaginable. Zhou Wen had never experienced such a terrifying aura.</p>
<p>This power… This power… It’s not at the Calamity grade, right? Amidst the terrifying aura, Zhou Wen’s body involuntarily trembled.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because Zhou Wen was afraid. At the critical moment, Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid. This was because fear was useless. His mind raced as he tried to come up with a way to survive.</p>
<p>That trembling was an instinct of life. It was an instinctive reaction when facing an irresistible calamity. It was a physical spasm triggered by powerlessness and despair.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen used interstellar teleportation and teleported to Venus.</p>
<p>Due to the loss of the turtle shell and the stone artifact’s suppression, there was no longer a spatial lock. Zhou Wen’s Singularity Universe’s powers played its role, allowing him to arrive above Venus.</p>
<p>However, before Zhou Wen could stand firm, he felt the world spin. He knew that something was amiss as he hurriedly circulated all sorts of powers, hoping to escape his present predicament.</p>
<p>Then, in the next instant, Zhou Wen’s figure appeared in the black-gray ape’s claw. At that moment, the black-gray ape’s aura was as terrifying as a devil king.</p>
<p>Due to its strength, its ape arms became as huge as two metal towers. It was as if it could crush the planet with one swipe of its claws if it wanted.</p>
<p>Taking the sun and moon, shrinking a thousand mountains, switching the positions of stars… This fellow is the Long-Armed Ape Monkey… Could these four apes really be the Four Dimitrios Monkeys? Zhou Wen was alarmed. To be able to pull him back from Venus, and with an ape’s body, Zhou Wen could only think of the Long-Armed Ape Monkey.</p>
<p>The black-gray ape suspected to be the Long-Armed Ape Monkey pinched Zhou Wen’s body between its fingernails. The Prisoned Dragon armor that Zhou Wen was wearing with Absolute Defense cracked and severely deformed under its strength.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Wen’s body was nearly flattened. His chest collapsed as blood spewed out of his mouth.</p>
<p>However, from the looks of it, the Long-Armed Ape Monkey didn’t seem to use much strength. It was just casually pinching Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“F*ck you,” Zhou Wen cursed as he suddenly unleashed his strength. He pulled out the Immortal Culling Sword and slashed at the black-gray ape’s face.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Halfway through the slash, the Immortal Culling Sword froze in midair. The Long-Armed Ape Monkey’s other claw grabbed the Immortal Culling Sword’s blade, preventing it from going any further.</p>
<p>With a flash of light, Demonic Neonate and Banana Fairy automatically rushed out of Zhou Wen’s body. Banana Fairy held the banana fan and fanned out Chaos Wind at the Long-Armed Ape Monkey.</p>
<p>The Demonic Sword in Demonic Neonate’s hand vanished as well. It strangely appeared beside the Long-Armed Ape Monkey’s ear and stabbed at its ear hole.</p>
<p>However, the Chaos Wind with the augmentation of the Three Realms’ Best Wind could only make the Long-Armed Ape Monkey’s fur stand up vertically. It didn’t injure it at all, nor did it make it move a step.</p>
<p>Just as the Demonic Sword was about to stab into the ear hole, it suddenly lost control and deviated from its trajectory. It instantly vanished. When it appeared again, it was already in the Long-Armed Ape Monkey’s claws.</p>
<p>The Long-Armed Ape Monkey didn’t seem to care about all of this.. It picked up Zhou Wen’s body in the wind and was about to throw him into its mouth.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter1308'>Chapter 1308: The Sound of Heaven and Earth All in One’s Ears</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that he had no choice but to have his beliefs shaken. Every time he entered a dimensional zone in real life, there was a high chance that something would happen.</p>
<p>This time, he was even more exasperated. He was only trying out a skill, but he had ended up causing such a huge mess. Now, he was probably going to lose his life.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to think about anything else. Just as he was about to be thrown into the Long-armed Ape’s mouth, his last thought was to terminate the contract with his Companion Beasts and allow them to regain their freedom to prevent them from dying with him.</p>
<p>For Companion Beasts like Demonic Neonate and Banana Fairy, it was better for them to escape than to die with him.</p>
<p>However, the Long-Armed Ape Monkey’s actions were too fast. While it was still a thought in his mind, he was thrown into the mouth that was filled with fangs before he could execute it. The jagged teeth were about to bite down.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A golden beam flashed like a phantom. The Long-Armed Ape Monkey’s teeth bit down, but it missed.</p>
<p>A golden figure appeared opposite the Long-Armed Ape Monkey amidst swirling light.</p>
<p>The golden figure was wearing armor that resembled crystalline gold. It was tall and slender, but he gave off an explosive sense of power and might.</p>
<p>Its long, golden hair hung down to its ankles. Its golden eyes were as pure as flawless crystals, and its face was like flawless jade.</p>
<p>It was as though the most beautiful thing in the world had landed on this man. The beauty of the world paled in comparison.</p>
<p>The perfect combination of strength and beauty was like a perfect god that only existed in fantasies.</p>
<p>However, such a pure and perfect man gave off an extremely evil feeling. It was as though one would fall into the demonic realm if they looked at him one more time.</p>
<p>At that moment, the man was princess-carrying a person, and that person was none other than Zhou Wen, who had nearly been devoured by the Long-Armed Ape Monkey.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the man’s face in a daze. He had already figured out who the man was based on his aura and the connection between the two of them, but he still found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>Truth Listener has actually changed into this! Zhou Wen was alarmed. If not for the contractual connection between the two of them, Zhou Wen would have found it unbelievable that the man in front of him was Truth Listener.</p>
<p>Roar! The Long-Armed Ape Monkey roared at Zhou Wen and Truth Listener. The roar blasted the seawater up, forming a tsunami-like wave that surged in all directions.</p>
<p>Its gigantic arms slowly raised as though it wanted to attack Zhou Wen and Truth Listener.</p>
<p>Truth Listener carried Zhou Wen as the golden light over its body flickered like flames. Its crystalline long hair danced with the flames as it stared intently at the Long-Armed Ape Monkey.</p>
<p>The Long-Armed Ape Monkey swung its huge arms and instantly vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that it hadn’t really vanished, but that the Long-Armed Ape Monkey’s strength and speed were so fast. It had already broken through the restrictions of space.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Truth Listener seemed to suffer a heavy blow as its body flew out like a golden stream of light. It streaked across the sea and slammed into a crumbling mountain wall, causing it to collapse.</p>
<p>Golden blood seeped out of Truth Listener’s mouth as it tore through the rubble and stood up. It was carrying Zhou Wen with both hands and Zhou Wen wasn’t injured at all.</p>
<p>Roar! The Long-Armed Ape Monkey roared at Truth Listener again.</p>
<p>However, Truth Listener didn’t seem to hear anything. It only stood there with Zhou Wen in its arms as it stared coldly at the Long-Armed Ape Monkey.</p>
<p>The Long-Armed Ape Monkey roared a few more times as though it was telling Truth Listener to mind its own business. However, Truth Listener ignored it and continued protecting Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The Long-Armed Ape Monkey seemed to be infuriated by Truth Listener’s persistence and rudeness. It raised its arms, hoping to attack again.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t as decisive as before. It seemed to be somewhat hesitant.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A loud bang shook the surroundings. The sky seemed to split into two as sunlight poured in, warming the apocalyptic world.</p>
<p>The Long-Armed Ape Monkey looked up. Sunlight shone on its face, making its ferocious face appear much gentler.</p>
<p>The other three apes roared at the sky. Their roars were filled with indescribable excitement and madness.</p>
<p>After the golden-haired ape roared, it glanced at Truth Listener and Zhou Wen. It spoke in human language and said “Thanks.” Then, it tore through the air and produced a cloud beneath its feet before disappearing into the sky.</p>
<p>The white-furred ape also looked at Truth Listener and Zhou Wen, but it didn’t say a word. All it did was shake its head before disappearing like a ghost.</p>
<p>The Long-Armed Ape Monkey glared fiercely at Zhou Wen, but it didn’t attack again. It extended its arms and pulled the two sides of the rift-like stone dome with its claws. It pulled the stone dome completely apart as though it was tearing apart the sky. It exerted strength into its feet and shot into the sky like a cannonball, instantly disappearing.</p>
<p>At its feet, the ground cracked and seawater gushed out. It was an apocalyptic scene.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the red-furred ape. The other monkeys had left, but it hadn’t. It floated in the air with a pair of heterochromic eyes. It was sizing up Truth Listener and Zhou Wen as it revealed a vexed expression that looked extremely human-like.</p>
<p>After a long while, the red-furred ape suddenly sighed and looked at Truth Listener. “Will you regret it if you exchange your life for his?”</p>
<p>Truth Listener didn’t say a word. However, its resolute eyes said everything.</p>
<p>“Whatever then. All is fated in life. It’s not up to us. Remember, you only have one life. And you can only live once.” With that said, the red-furred monkey slowly walked towards the sky.</p>
<p>Under its feet, there seemed to be an invisible staircase. After taking 49 steps, the red-furred monkey’s figure became fainter as it vanished as though it had turned into nothingness.</p>
<p>Pfft!</p>
<p>After the red-furred monkey vanished, Truth Listener placed Zhou Wen on the ground and suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood. The golden light on its body quickly converged as its body gradually turned from a human to an ape.</p>
<p>One earring after another appeared out of thin air and returned to Truth Listener’s ear. When the sixth earring returned to his ear, he had already transformed back into the Six-Eared Golden Silk Monkey. He was no longer the godlike man from before.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took out the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence and wanted to feed it to Truth Listener, but Truth Listener shook its head and suddenly transformed into a stream of light that returned to Zhou Wen’s ear, turning back into an earring.</p>
<p>When the earring returned, Zhou Wen felt the world become extremely complicated. All sorts of sounds entered his ears that threatened to blow up his head.</p>
<p>Countless voices entered Zhou Wen’s ears. There were so many that it was incalculable. They came from afar, extremely far away, as though they were coming from the end of the horizon. They were extremely close, as though countless people were whispering in his ear. There were so many voices that it was unimaginable. If a drop of water represented a different sound, Zhou Wen would receive even more sounds than the water in the Pacific every second.</p>
<p>The sounds of the world were all in his ears. Zhou Wen’s body could sense this magical power, but at the same time, he realized that this might not be a f*cking good thing.</p>
<p>There were too many useless sounds. To find the sounds he needed to hear amidst the massive amount of sounds was no different from searching for a needle in a haystack.. At the very least, Zhou Wen was still unable to adapt to this situation.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1309'>Chapter 1309: Hot</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t used to receiving the sounds of everything in the world, but he wasn’t in the mood to think about it. He planned on leaving first.</p>
<p>Flying out of the ripped stone dome, Zhou Wen looked back and couldn’t help but widen his mouth.</p>
<p>The place he had flown out of was originally a huge underground space, but when he looked back, he realized that it was only a stone in the shape of a calabash. It was only about a foot tall and looked very crude. It looked like it was naturally formed and had sharp edges. It was in a cobblestone by a stream.</p>
<p>At that moment, the calabash-shaped stone had already been split into two. One could see that water was flowing out, but the amount that flowed out was only small. It was around the amount stored in a bottle of mineral water.</p>
<p>I was inside this thing? Zhou Wen found it unbelievable. He walked to the two halves of the calabash and reached out to pick them up.</p>
<p>However, no matter how Zhou Wen looked at it, it seemed to be a very ordinary stone. Apart from its strange form, there was nothing special about it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pinched hard and the stone shattered and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Was I dreaming? Zhou Wen looked around and saw a babbling brook. Green bamboo cast a shadow as the bright sunlight shone on him. It was so warm and comfortable that he couldn’t tell if it was reality or a dream.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen knew that he wasn’t dreaming. The sound of the world in his ears made him uncomfortable due to the massive amount of information. He couldn’t even distinguish the sound that was inches away.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen first attempted to get his bearings. He never expected to have reception here. Using his phone’s positioning function, he realized that he was still in the East District. However, it was south of the East District. There was a human city about fifty kilometers away.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed the phone’s map and quickly arrived at the human city. He confirmed that he was in the correct spot using his phone.</p>
<p>On the way, he kept trying to deactivate Truth Listener’s power, but he couldn’t. The sounds constantly surged into his ears.</p>
<p>Ordinary people could tell what a sound came from based on its size and location, but Truth Listener’s listening mode was somewhat different.</p>
<p>Regardless of the distance, be it loud or soft, even if it was as far as Venus, Zhou Wen could hear it clearly. Furthermore, there were unimaginable sounds coming from the same spot. Despite there being nothing in front of him, Zhou Wen heard countless sounds.</p>
<p>Now, if Zhou Wen wanted to hear a particular sound clearly, he had to switch channels like on a television. Only by switching to a fixed channel could he accurately hear the sound. Otherwise, with so many sounds mixed together, his brain couldn’t process them all. The outcome was the same as not hearing anything.</p>
<p>However, there were only a few hundred television channels. The choices Zhou Wen needed to face were as numerous as infinite grains of sand. It wasn’t easy to make the right selection. He needed to slowly adapt.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that it was because his ability was too weak and Truth Listener’s ability was too powerful that it had resulted in such hearing difficulties. When he reached a level that matched Truth Listener’s ability, he probably wouldn’t have such problems again.</p>
<p>He took out his phone again and looked at Truth Listener’s information.</p>
<p>Truth Listener: Mythical (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Heaven’s Senses</p>
<p>Life Soul: Evil Nullification</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Nirvana of Ultimate Hell</p>
<p>Terror Form: Holy Evil</p>
<p>Strength: 99</p>
<p>Speed: 99</p>
<p>Constitution: 99</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 99</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Truth Listener, Indestructible Vajra Body, Evil Warding, Nine Extremes</p>
<p>Companion Form: Earring</p>
<p>Truth Listener’s evolution was far lower than Zhou Wen imagined.</p>
<p>An existence like the Long-Armed Ape Monkey was most likely at the Apocalypse grade. It was truly unexpected for Truth Listener to withstand its strike head-on while being only at the Terror grade. Zhou Wen imagined that it could directly jump to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>However, when he thought of Truth Listener’s six earrings, he knew that this fellow’s Terror grade was likely only at the level after being sealed by the earrings. It definitely wasn’t at that level after the earrings were removed.</p>
<p>What’s Truth Listener’s origins? Zhou Wen was alarmed. He planned on visiting the Small Buddha Temple after returning. Perhaps he could find some clues.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to return as soon as possible, but he realized that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Although the weather in the south was warmer, it shouldn’t be that hot, right?</p>
<p>On the streets here, people were wearing shorts and vests, but they were still covered in sweat from the heat. When he looked up at the sun, it didn’t seem that scorching.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen counted the days. It wasn’t even summer yet, so it shouldn’t be that hot.</p>
<p>The situation outside was even worse. The rice paddies had all dried up, and the soil was showing signs of cracking. The rice that had been planted with great difficulty had already dried up in the ground before it even reached maturity.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen went to a small shop and bought some things. He asked when he was paying, “Is the weather here always this hot?”</p>
<p>However, at such a close distance, Zhou Wen couldn’t hear what the shop owner was saying. This was because there were too many sounds coming from his position. The sounds of bacteria squirming in the air and dust colliding were unimaginable.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only saw the shop owner open his mouth, but he didn’t know what he was saying. He was somewhat anxious.</p>
<p>He was momentarily unable to find the correct channel. He wanted to see if he could tell what he was saying from the shape of his mouth, but he was disappointed. He didn’t know if it was because the other party spoke in a dialect or if his lip-reading sucked, but Zhou Wen couldn’t interpret it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked around and saw that there was a pen and paper used by the shop owner on the counter. He took them and wrote on them. “I’m deaf. Can you tell me in writing?”</p>
<p>“Deaf? That’s really rare. Usually, deaf people are mute, right?” The shop owner wrote in a notebook.</p>
<p>“I lost my hearing later in life,” Zhou Wen explained.</p>
<p>“Then it’s no wonder.” As there was no business the shop owner was free to chat with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen realize that the weather nearby had suddenly turned hot. It happened nearly half a month ago. In the past few months, although there had been a few abnormally hot days, they didn’t last long. Typically, they would return to normal in a few hours.</p>
<p>However, the recent high temperature had lasted for half a month. It was so hot that it was almost unbearable. Ordinary people would probably die from the heat.</p>
<p>Many people had already begun to migrate to other areas. It was strange that such dry and hot weather only affected the nearby hundreds of kilometers. It wasn’t as if the entire south was hot. Everything was fine as long as they left this area.</p>
<p>Many people guessed that a large dimensional zone had broken out nearby, so they fled. For instance, this city didn’t have many people left. This was why the owner was so free to talk.</p>
<p>“A few hundred kilometers of the vicinity?” Zhou Wen’s heart suddenly skipped a beat.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1310'>Chapter 1310: Joining the Zhang Family Again</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen quickly took out his phone and checked the map to confirm his memory.</p>
<p>The Zhang family is within the area! Zhou Wen opened his contact list and sent a message to Zhang Yuzhi: “I happen to be nearby. Do you have the time to meet?”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Zhang Yuzhi quickly replied, surprising Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The Zhang family had protected Zhang Yuzhi too well. It was rare for Zhang Yuzhi to communicate with others.</p>
<p>“Did something happen to the Fiend Tomb?” Zhou Wen asked directly.</p>
<p>“Yes, something did happen,” Zhang Yuzhi replied.</p>
<p>“Do you need help?” Zhou Wen felt uncomfortable. Although Zhang Yuzhi sounded relaxed, Zhou Wen knew that once something happened to the Fiend Tomb, it wouldn’t be a small problem.</p>
<p>The person inside was likely the legendary Drought Demon. If she were to be born, there was a high chance that she would be accompanied by a calamity.</p>
<p>Unlike ordinary Guardians, she was a Guardian that had survived the Mythical era. Her level was very high to begin with. Although Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if a Calamity-grade Guardian would trigger a calamity phenomenon, legend had it that when the Drought Demon appeared, it would have the world in flames.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the weather in the nearby area seemed to be affected. This was terrifying.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi’s Ghost Parade was already very terrifying, but it was nothing compared to Drought Demon.</p>
<p>When she lit the world in flames, everything within a 500-kilometer radius would be reduced to scorched earth. Not a single blade of grass would remain. As long as Drought Demon passed through an area, all humans would probably become extinct.</p>
<p>However, from the present situation, Drought Demon had yet to appear. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be as simple as the weather turning hot.</p>
<p>“It’s just a small problem. My family is trying to think of a solution, but it’s rare for you to take the initiative to help. I won’t stand on ceremony. I happen to have something to do and need help. Come to my place now.” Zhang Yuzhi even sent a cheeky wink emoji.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll head over now.” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief when he saw that Zhang Yuzhi was in a good mood. From the looks of it, there wasn’t much of a problem.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen arrived at the Zhang family residence, Zhang Yuzhi was already waiting for him at the door. Zhang Chunqiu was with her.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, it’s really difficult to meet you these days,” Zhang Yuzhi said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Aren’t I here now?” Zhou Wen couldn’t explain himself. In the past few years, Zhang Yuzhi had sent him quite a number of messages, but he had been trapped for five years without having the chance to read the messages.</p>
<p>However, because An Jing had replaced him for five years, Zhou Wen couldn’t expose this matter.</p>
<p>“Brother Zhang, how’s the situation at the Fiend Tomb?” Zhou Wen was very concerned about the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>This was because once Drought Demon appeared, it wouldn’t only affect the Zhang family, nor would it only be a city or area. When the time came, the entire East District might suffer a terrifying calamity. It was impossible for Zhou Wen and his family to stay out of it.</p>
<p>“I’m thinking of a way to resolve it. The area affected won’t be too great,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a lot more at ease hearing Zhang Chunqiu say that. After some thought, he asked, “Brother Zhang, I’ve only heard that the birth of a Calamity-grade dimensional creature will be accompanied by a calamity phenomenon. I wonder if a Calamity-grade Guardian will also trigger a calamity phenomenon?”</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu pondered for a moment and said, “Typically, the appearance of any Calamity-grade creature doesn’t trigger a calamity phenomenon. It only happens when a creature advances to the Calamity grade. No matter what creature it is, it’s the same. Guardians are naturally no exception.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhang Chunqiu’s words, Zhou Wen felt that this matter wasn’t serious. Drought Demon should have been at the Calamity grade in the Mythical era. It was impossible for her to trigger another Calamity phenomenon unless she used the Calamity Zone herself.</p>
<p>However, from the Zhang family’s attitude, it was unlikely that Drought Demon would appear so easily. Otherwise, they would have long evacuated. It was impossible for them to stay here and wait for death.</p>
<p>“Are you here to help or to chat?” Zhang Yuzhi smiled.</p>
<p>“If there’s anything you need my help with, I’ll do it to the best of my abilities,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Then follow me.” Zhang Yuzhi turned around and entered the Zhang residence.</p>
<p>“Go on. I still have something on, so I won’t be accompanying you,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a smile as he looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen follow Zhang Yuzhi into the Zhang residence. As the Zhang family doted on Zhang Yuzhi to the extreme and with Zhang Yuzhi’s own specialness, the Zhang family typically didn’t allow outsiders to interact with her.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed Zhang Yuzhi through the corridors and courtyards and arrived at a small yard.</p>
<p>This yard wasn’t very big, but it was decorated very elegantly. There were many flowers planted inside, but it didn’t feel complicated or redundant. It was as though every blade of grass and flower ought to be there.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know much about flowers and plants, but he could tell that the person who had set up the yard was amazing. It was the kind of extraordinary person who had his own creative thoughts.</p>
<p>“My garden isn’t bad, right?” Zhang Yuzhi asked Zhou Wen smugly.</p>
<p>“You set this up?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“Why? Can’t I?” Zhang Yuzhi curled her lips.</p>
<p>“No, it’s great. I never expected you to be so accomplished in this area,” Zhou Wen said sincerely.</p>
<p>He had always wanted to learn the Dao of Nature, hoping to use it to comprehend the true meaning of Slaughterer. This was because Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that Slaughterer’s foundation wasn’t as simple as killing.</p>
<p>To live from death, perhaps the Slaughterer’s foundation was related to the way of life.</p>
<p>Since Slaughterer couldn’t transform into its Terror form, Zhou Wen had thought of using the Dao of Nature, but he really wasn’t adept in this area, so he hadn’t achieved much.</p>
<p>“It’s really rare to receive your praise. However, your level of praise kinda sucks,” Zhang Yuzhi said happily.</p>
<p>“I’m really not good at that. Let’s talk about something I can help with,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You’re really boring. I don’t think you have any friends, right?” Zhang Yuzhi curled her lips.</p>
<p>“Indeed… I don’t have many friends…” Zhou Wen thought carefully and realized that it was true. He really couldn’t think of many people who could be considered friends.</p>
<p>“What has this got to do with the help you want from me?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“You’re really hopeless. Wait for me here.” Zhang Yuzhi rolled her eyes at him before turning around and walking into the room. Soon, she came out with a bucket.</p>
<p>“Come on, help me plant flowers today.” Zhang Yuzhi took out a shovel from the bucket and handed it to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“You wanted my help just to plant flowers?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>“Why? Are you reneging on your words?” Zhang Yuzhi said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll do whatever you say.” Zhou Wen felt that this was a good thing. Zhang Yuzhi’s relaxed attitude meant that the matter with the Fiend Tomb wasn’t too serious.</p>
<p>Hence, under Zhang Yuzhi’s command, Zhou Wen began his career as a gardener.</p>
<p>“Loosen the soil… Sigh… Why are you so stupid… It’s loosening the soil, not digging up a pit… Water that area… It’s watering, not dripping eye drops. How long will it take if you drip it drop by drop… Ah… Why are you pouring it all in? Do you want to drown my poor flowers…”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1311'>Chapter 1311: Zhang Chunqiu’s Request</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen kept smiling as though he didn’t care what Zhang Yuzhi said.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen basically couldn’t hear Zhang Yuzhi. Along the way, he tried to get used to the world’s sounds Truth Listener brought to him.</p>
<p>However, this was just too difficult. Ignoring the fact that he could receive all kinds of the sounds, Zhou Wen could only occasionally hear the right channels even if it was a sound coming from right in front of him.</p>
<p>When he listened to Zhang Yuzhi, it was basically two parts listening and seven parts guessing. The other ten percent was completely wrong, so he kept messing up Zhang Yuzhi’s instructions.</p>
<p>With his control over his powers, even if he didn’t know any gardening, he wouldn’t have made so many mistakes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that Zhang Yuzhi would be angry at his actions. After all, it was obvious that she had put in a lot of effort into this garden. Every blade of grass and tree looked ordinary, but they were actually carefully selected.</p>
<p>However, although Zhang Yuzhi kept nagging at Zhou Wen, she wasn’t really angry. Instead, she patiently told him what to do.</p>
<p>However, as Zhou Wen could barely understand half of it despite listening and guessing, he appeared very clumsy. Zhang Yuzhi often repeated it a few times, but Zhou Wen still couldn’t figure out what to do.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi wasn’t in a rush. She seemed to treat teaching the clumsy Zhou Wen how to garden and her nagging as a form of enjoyment.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush either. After all, he had to practice adapting to the abilities Truth Listener had given him. However, he felt somewhat embarrassed doing something at odds with the instructions.</p>
<p>That day, Zhou Wen didn’t do anything but help Zhang Yuzhi with the garden.</p>
<p>In fact, it should be said that he was destroying the garden. Zhou Wen couldn’t understand the instructions, so he made many mistakes. For example, the water that should have been poured at the roots ended up being poured on the leaves. Although it wasn’t a big deal, there were many mistakes. The originally perfect and immaculate garden lost a little of its luster.</p>
<p>Despite knowing this, Zhang Yuzhi refused to do it herself. She continued commanding Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Only when the sun went down and Zhang Chunqiu called them for dinner did Zhang Yuzhi let Zhou Wen off.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen kept trying to listen and speak less, Zhang Chunqiu and Zhang Yuzhi were extremely smart. They could naturally tell that Zhou Wen’s hearing was problematic.</p>
<p>However, since Zhou Wen didn’t say anything, they didn’t ask. They continued chatting with Zhou Wen with a smile. Even if Zhou Wen’s answer didn’t seem to make sense, they would still continue chatting as though they hadn’t discovered his abnormality.</p>
<p>“It’s getting late. I should take my leave.” After eating, Zhou Wen planned on returning to Luoyang.</p>
<p>“No way. The garden work isn’t done yet. Are you leaving just like that? Are you giving up halfway?” Zhang Yuzhi said with widened eyes.</p>
<p>Even though Zhou Wen didn’t hear what Zhang Yuzhi said, he could tell what she had said from her expression.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that not being able to hear what the other party said wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. Some people said that if one closed their eyes and listened to this world, they would discover many beautiful things that had been neglected in the past.</p>
<p>In fact, it was the same the other way around. Without sound, it was impossible to hear the other party’s words. Without the modification of words, one could only silently look with their eyes and discover many things that were previously difficult to discover.</p>
<p>Human expressions and body language are interesting. Zhou Wen realized that he easily ignored the other party’s emotions in the past. He only determined the other party’s thoughts from their words.</p>
<p>Now, he realized that many times, words could lie, but the emotions of the body language’s reaction didn’t lie.</p>
<p>While he couldn’t hear the other party’s words, Zhou Wen’s ability to read body language rapidly improved.</p>
<p>“I can’t stay here forever to help you take care of the garden, right?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Being able to read someone’s emotions didn’t mean that Zhou Wen’s EQ improved. In fact, reading and understanding were two different matters.</p>
<p>“At the very least, you have to correct the parts you destroyed, right?” Zhang Yuzhi said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen heard that. After some thought, he felt that it made sense. He was clearly here to help, but he had ended up wrecking the garden. It wasn’t nice.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s continue tomorrow.” Zhou Wen thought to himself that he had roughly learned the gardening trade. It wouldn’t take long tomorrow to correct everything.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi didn’t feel well, so Zhang Chunqiu got someone to take her back to rest after the meal.</p>
<p>“Don’t try to go back on your words and run away.” Before leaving, Zhang Yuzhi turned her head and teased Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t hear what she was saying, nor could he guess what her expression meant. All he could do was respond with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi burst into a peal of laughter before turning to leave.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was helpless. He didn’t know what Zhang Yuzhi was talking about, much less what she was laughing at. He felt like a fool.</p>
<p>“I’ll take you to your guest room.” After Zhang Chunqiu took Zhou Wen to the guest room, he didn’t leave immediately. Instead, he sat down beside the table.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu extended his index finger, dipped it into the teacup, and wrote: “Zhou Wen, do you need help?”</p>
<p>“Thank you. I’m fine. I’ll recover after some time.” Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised. It would be strange if Zhang Chunqiu couldn’t tell.</p>
<p>“I do have something that I really need your help with.” Zhang Chunqiu wrote solemnly.</p>
<p>“Could it be that the Fiend Tomb’s situation is very bad?” Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu shook his head and wrote again. “I hope you can stay in the Zhang family for four more days.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen looked at Zhang Chunqiu in puzzlement. He wanted him to stay, but he didn’t say what he wanted him to do. This left Zhou Wen puzzled.</p>
<p>“Help me protect my sis for the next four days.” The sis Zhang Chunqiu mentioned was Zhang Yuzhi.</p>
<p>As Zhang Yuzhi was the only woman in the Zhang family’s current generation, Zhang Chunqiu and company were used to calling her sis.</p>
<p>“Is Yuzhi in danger?” Zhou Wen’s expression turned solemn.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu nodded. “There’s an internal problem with the Zhang family. I’m afraid that someone will harm sis. You should understand that it’s not convenient for me to use my family’s manpower at such times.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment. Four days shouldn’t be difficult. “Four days. No problem.”</p>
<p>Although the Zhang family was powerful, they ultimately didn’t have a Calamity-grade expert. It shouldn’t be too difficult to protect Zhang Yuzhi.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Zhang Chunqiu said the words with his mouth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen happened to hear this and shook his head. “Yuzhi is my friend. She once saved me too. It’s only right.”</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu didn’t say anything else. He smiled at Zhou Wen and got up to leave his room.</p>
<p>After Zhang Chunqiu left the yard, Zhang Xiao walked over and said in puzzlement, “Why did you want to keep Zhou Wen behind at such a time?”</p>
<p>“Sis has sacrificed too much for the Zhang family. She doesn’t even have a normal friend. Since she’s happy, let Zhou Wen stay and accompany her for a few days,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen is just a dimwit. Since you want to make sis happy, you should tell him and get him to do his best to please her. Otherwise, with Zhou Wen’s personality, he will only make her unhappy,” Zhang Xiao said.</p>
<p>“Are you doubting sis’s intelligence, or do you think sis is the kind of person who will happily accept pity?” Zhang Chunqiu glanced coldly at Zhang Xiao.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1312'>Chapter 1312: Zhang Yuzhi’s Talent</h3>
<p>Zhang Xiao was alarmed as he hurriedly lowered his head and said, “I was too anxious. I also wish for sis to be happy.”</p>
<p>“Happy? I do hope that she can be sad.” Zhang Chunqiu looked up in a particular direction and said with a complicated expression, “Born in the Zhang family, she doesn’t even have the right to be sad. If possible, I hope that she can understand what sadness is. That way, at the very least, she will still be sis.”</p>
<p>Zhang Xiao said gloomily, “If I had a choice, I would rather bear this on behalf of sis, but the one in the Fiend Tomb…”</p>
<p>“Shut up.” Zhang Chunqiu, who had always been gentle and calm, suddenly flew into a rage. He stared at Zhang Xiao with a gaze akin to a saber.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiao was alarmed as his body trembled and he involuntarily took two steps back.</p>
<p>Although they were brothers of about the same age, Zhang Xiao had deep respect for Zhang Chunqiu. Usually, he would snap back at Zhang Chunqiu or even deliberately argue with him.</p>
<p>However, once Zhang Chunqiu was serious, Zhang Xiao didn’t dare say anything else. Zhang Xiao had never seen such a situation of Zhang Chunqiu being angry. He was alarmed and almost didn’t dare look up at him.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu stared coldly at Zhang Xiao and said, “You have to remember that you are alive because of sis. You have no right to say anything about replacing her. It’s the same for everyone in the Zhang family. Sis doesn’t owe anyone in the Zhang family. Only the Zhang family owes her. If you really want to save her so much, leave your life behind. Without the Zhang family and us, sis wouldn’t have to suffer any of this.”</p>
<p>“Brother, I got it. That’s not what I mean…” Zhang Xiao’s face turned livid and pale after hearing Zhang Chunqiu’s words, but he didn’t dare argue. Even his words were incoherent.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu didn’t say anything else, nor did he listen to Zhang Xiao. He turned around and left.</p>
<p>Only when Zhang Chunqiu vanished from Zhang Xiao’s sight did Zhang Xiao’s expression gradually return to normal. He gritted his teeth and muttered, “Aren’t you the same? What right do you have to be angry at me?”</p>
<p>The next day, Zhou Wen went to Zhang Yuzhi’s garden again.</p>
<p>The Zhang Yuzhi today was like a different person from the Zhang Yuzhi yesterday.</p>
<p>She had dressed very formally yesterday, like a daughter of a rich family. When she was in front of outsiders, she was very polite. It was obvious that she came from a rich family and was like a high and mighty princess.</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn’t an exaggeration to say that Zhang Yuzhi was a princess. The Zhang family’s influence was much greater than any ancient country.</p>
<p>However, today, Zhang Yuzhi had her hair tied up in a ponytail. She wore jeans and a short sleeve black t-shirt. She also wore a long hat.</p>
<p>Although her figure was still very good and her long, slender legs were very attractive, she looked like a completely different person from yesterday.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Zhou Wen noticed a pile of things in the middle of the garden. It was covered by a large black silk cloth. He didn’t know what it was.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen remembered that the garden didn’t have these things yesterday.</p>
<p>“This is good stuff. Have you heard of the saying that music makes plants happy?” Zhang Yuzhi blinked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t hear Zhang Yuzhi’s words, nor could he tell what she was saying. All he could do was remain silent.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi seemed to have guessed that Zhou Wen would have such a reaction, so she continued mysteriously, “Based on research in ancient times, it’s said that plants can grow better after listening to nice music. According to research, ordinary vegetables would grow better, becoming fresher and more vibrant than those vegetables that didn’t listen to music.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen occasionally heard a few words. He only knew that Zhang Yuzhi seemed to be saying things like “vegetables,” “music,” and “happiness.” He couldn’t figure out what she meant.</p>
<p>“Let’s begin work,” Zhou Wen said helplessly.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi curled her lips as though she wasn’t satisfied with Zhou Wen’s reaction. However, she still pulled Zhou Wen to the pile of items and lifted the black silk cloth.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen see that there was a set of drums.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say you wanted to clean up the garden? Why did you bring these things here?” Zhou Wen asked as he looked at the drums.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi’s eyes were crafty as she sat down in front of the drums and said to Zhou Wen, “Music will make flowers happy.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen finally heard this and immediately guessed what Zhang Yuzhi had said.</p>
<p>“Let me perform for you now. I’ve carefully practiced playing music. I have a nickname in the Zhang family—Little Mozart of the Zhang family,” Zhang Yuzhi said as she picked up the drumstick and began striking the drums.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t hear what Zhang Yuzhi was saying, nor did he know who Mozart was. All he could do was listen attentively to the drumbeats.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Zhang Yuzhi as his expression turned odder.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi was engrossed in playing, but even if Zhou Wen didn’t know music, even if he had never heard the drum music before, and even if he could only occasionally hear a small part of it, this didn’t affect his belief that the flowers wouldn’t be happy hearing such “music.”</p>
<p>No, it didn’t deserve being called music. It was more appropriate to call it noise.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Yuzhi seemed to be intoxicated. As she drummed hard, she seemed to shout at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t hear a single word this time. The drumming caused a huge obstacle to his hearing.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the sound of the drums itself. The sound of the drums affected the various plants in the garden. Petals, leaves, grass, insects, and even dust and bacteria produced more sounds due to the tremors.</p>
<p>The amount of sound in the garden increased exponentially, preventing Zhou Wen from hearing Zhang Yuzhi’s words. It was difficult for him to capture her voice amidst the chaotic cacophony.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi said many things, but when she saw that Zhou Wen didn’t react at all, she didn’t get angry. Instead, she revealed a meaningful smile.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi stopped the drumstick in her hand and said to Zhou Wen, “Zhou Wen, you’re really smart. You’re so smart that it’s like… Clang…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen focused all his attention on Zhang Yuzhi’s voice. As the drumming stopped, the amount of sounds decreased drastically. He was lucky to capture Zhang Yuzhi’s voice and hear her.</p>
<p>However, when Zhang Yuzhi spoke, she casually drummed again. Her voice immediately disrupted Zhou Wen’s hearing, preventing him from hearing what she said next.</p>
<p>However, from the first half of her sentence, she was probably praising him for being smart.</p>
<p>“Thank you. You flatter me,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>When Zhang Yuzhi heard Zhou Wen’s words, her expression appeared serious, but her eyes turned into crescents. This was because her last words were “as smart as a pig.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1313'>Chapter 1313: The Last Musical Instrument</h3>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you are a huge fool. You are simple-minded, all brawn and no brains, and are as stupid as a pig…” When Zhang Yuzhi cursed, her face was filled with adoration.</p>
<p>However, as she spoke and struck the drums, Zhou Wen really didn’t hear anything she said. He felt somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>Only when Zhang Yuzhi stopped drumming did Zhou Wen finally hear half a sentence.</p>
<p>“I really adore you…” Zhang Yuzhi’s voice finally entered Zhou Wen’s ears.</p>
<p>“I’m not that good!” Zhou Wen scratched the back of his head in embarrassment. He never expected Zhang Yuzhi to be praising him with such a long speech.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that perhaps Zhang Yuzhi was too embarrassed to praise him directly, so she had used such a tactful method.</p>
<p>“I really adore you… You’re so stupid…” Zhang Yuzhi continued striking the drums.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that when Zhang Yuzhi struck the drums as she spoke, her expression seemed innocent and kind. Yet, Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>No, I have to think of a way to hear what she’s saying. Zhang Yuzhi kept speaking to Zhou Wen, but Zhou Wen couldn’t hear anything. This left him depressed.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that he was bent on hearing Zhang Yuzhi, but he felt that something was amiss. Zhang Yuzhi’s drumbeat was clearly interfering with his hearing.</p>
<p>However, it was difficult to capture Zhang Yuzhi’s voice to begin with. It was even more difficult with the interference of the drums.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen made repeated attempts, but the outcome wasn’t ideal. As the interference was so severe, it was almost impossible for him to capture Zhang Yuzhi’s voice.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to try my luck to capture the useful sounds, and I can’t tell the source of the sound from its position and amplitude. Is there any other way to lock onto a particular sound? Zhou Wen’s first thought was naturally the frequency of sounds.</p>
<p>Using frequency, he could indeed determine some special frequencies, but the frequency of human voices was just too ordinary. It was overwhelmed by many other sound frequencies. Even if Zhou Wen locked onto Zhang Yuzhi’s vocal frequency, he would still receive a massive amount of information.</p>
<p>Finding Zhang Yuzhi’s voice was no different from finding a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>If frequency doesn’t work, are there any other characteristics to the sound? The frequency, pitch, and tone of human voices are indeed very recognizable within a certain range, but this information is hidden in the massive amount of sound information. There are too many similarities. Just humans alone have billions. The interference is too serious… Zhou Wen had no choice but to listen carefully to Zhang Yuzhi’s voice again and again.</p>
<p>He hoped to discover something different from the other voices, but the outcome naturally wasn’t that desirable. Human voices weren’t that recognizable in the massive amount of information.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi didn’t constantly strike the drums. When she wasn’t striking, she would also instruct Zhou Wen to take care of the flowers.</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhou Wen could easily capture Zhang Yuzhi’s voice and use it to constantly compare and make judgments.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen couldn’t hear her when she struck the drums, his ability to capture her voice increased during normal periods.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen spent the next few days with the Zhang family.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi made a fool of Zhou Wen in different ways. In the morning, she played the drums; in the afternoon, she played the piano; and at night, she played the violin.</p>
<p>No matter how slow Zhou Wen was, he knew that Zhang Yuzhi had definitely said something unexpected. However, he didn’t know what she was talking about.</p>
<p>Progress hadn’t been smooth over the past few days. Be it the frequency, pitch, or tone, there was no way to truly lock onto a sound from the various aspects.</p>
<p>Although with his proficiency, Zhou Wen could occasionally hear a sound he wanted to hear, it required a certain amount of luck and a relatively quiet environment.</p>
<p>If Zhang Yuzhi made some complicated sounds, Zhou Wen basically couldn’t hear anything clearly. The overlapping of sound was just too chaotic.</p>
<p>This situation didn’t improve after four days. Zhou Wen ultimately couldn’t hear what Zhang Yuzhi had said when she spoke.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen knew one thing very well. Zhang Yuzhi didn’t know anything about musical instruments.</p>
<p>Time passed in the blink of an eye. Soon, it was time to meet Zhang Chunqiu, but Zhou Wen found it odd.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu was afraid that someone would harm Zhang Yuzhi, but nothing had happened for the past four days. Apart from Zhang Chunqiu and a few others, no one had approached the garden.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen didn’t wish for anything to happen.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu came to Zhou Wen and told him that the matter had been resolved. He could leave the Zhang family.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen went to the garden to bid Zhang Yuzhi farewell. Zhang Yuzhi likely knew that Zhou Wen was leaving today and was waiting for him in the garden.</p>
<p>“I still have one last instrument I’m good at. You can leave after listening,” Zhang Yuzhi said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt somewhat helpless when he heard that. He was about to leave, but Zhang Yuzhi still wanted to tease him.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was thinking about how to reject Zhang Yuzhi, she had already sat down in front of a zither.</p>
<p>Closing her eyes, Zhang Yuzhi’s fingers hung above the strings. After a while, she finally strummed the zither strings.</p>
<p>Her eyes were closed the entire time as her fingers seemed to dance. Even if he couldn’t hear the zither music, Zhou Wen knew that Zhang Yuzhi wasn’t randomly playing. She really knew how to play.</p>
<p>After playing for a while, Zhang Yuzhi spoke again. However, this time, she wasn’t speaking, but singing.</p>
<p>Looking at Zhang Yuzhi, who was playing and singing with her eyes closed, Zhou Wen suddenly wanted to know what she was playing and what she was singing.</p>
<p>For some reason, Zhou Wen didn’t feel anything despite Zhang Yuzhi getting so many musical instruments and producing all those sounds with an extremely rich expression on her face. However, this time, when he looked at Zhang Yuzhi, who had her eyes closed and had no expression, Zhou Wen’s heart stirred.</p>
<p>As he watched, Zhou Wen suddenly heard a gentle voice. Amidst the cacophony, it sounded very soft and weak. However, Zhou Wen gradually felt that the other sounds around him were gradually receding like a tidal wave, and this sound was becoming clearer.</p>
<p>“The familiar face… in my dreams… Is the tenderness that I await… Even though tears flood the world… I will never let go… Every moment… passes in loneliness… Only because I promised…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen finally heard Zhang Yuzhi singing and playing something. The music and singing were very moving, but for some reason, Zhang Yuzhi gradually turned into a little girl in Zhou Wen’s eyes. She hugged her knees with both arms and curled her body, trembling in the boundless darkness.</p>
<p>There was no light in her world.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1314'>Chapter 1314: Thoughts</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Zhang Yuzhi in a daze. Zhang Yuzhi was still Zhang Yuzhi. In his eyes, Zhang Yuzhi was still playing the zither with her eyes closed as she immersed herself in her singing.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, the scene of a little girl curled up in the darkness surfaced in Zhou Wen’s mind. He could even hear her trembling and tragic voice.</p>
<p>“Since the heavens have already destined me to walk into the darkness… I’ll exchange for everyone’s light using the darkness I suffer alone… This is what I deserve… They all treat me as a friend… They would rather die than let me suffer any harm… Yet, I caused their deaths… Such a filthy me… I’m not worthy of embracing the light… Zhang Yuzhi… You deserve death… What’s there to be afraid of?”</p>
<p>The little girl looked up as tears flowed down her face. She looked ahead and in front of her, there was a sliver of light in the darkness.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. The light came from a figure that emitted light like an angel. However, it didn’t have wings or an angel’s halo. It only had the appearance of a human, and its appearance was identical to Zhou Wen’s.</p>
<p>The girl looked at the figure as though she wanted to extend her hand to grab something, but when her hand was halfway out, she slowly retracted it cowardly.</p>
<p>“A person like me… only brings misfortune to friends… only harms them… I don’t deserve to have friends…” The little girl looked at the figure reluctantly and slowly retracted her hand. Finally, she buried her head in her arms and curled up, sobbing softly.</p>
<p>The only figure that brought the sliver of light scattered in the darkness. The world instantly returned to its despairing darkness.</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhang Yuzhi had finished singing. She opened her eyes and the scene of the girl in Zhou Wen’s mind vanished as though everything was just a dream.</p>
<p>The various sounds that had vanished returned to Zhou Wen’s ears, plummeting him into a sea of noise again.</p>
<p>“How’s my singing?” Zhang Yuzhi asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because the sea of noise had just surged over and hadn’t completely occupied Zhou Wen’s hearing, he heard the sentence clearly.</p>
<p>“I didn’t hear you clearly.” Zhou Wen shook his head.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, he did hear Zhang Yuzhi’s voice. Furthermore, he heard it very clearly and wasn’t affected by the sea of noise. However, he couldn’t remember what she had sung. All he could remember was the scene and voice of the little girl.</p>
<p>“You idiot who doesn’t know how to appreciate art. Just seeing you makes me angry. Go, go, go. Don’t let me see you again.” Zhang Yuzhi looked very upset. With that said, she got up and returned to her building.</p>
<p>“Sorry, we spoiled Yuzhi. She’s a little willful, but she doesn’t have any ill intentions. Don’t blame her,” Zhang Chunqiu said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I know.” Zhou Wen was surprised to discover that the chances of him accurately capturing sounds had increased significantly.</p>
<p>“I’ll walk you out,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hesitated for a moment before asking Zhang Chunqiu, “Is the Fiend Tomb really fine?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you think that the weather these two days has been much cooler?” Zhang Chunqiu didn’t answer directly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen understood what he meant. The scorching hot weather had gradually returned to normal over the past few days. It seemed to indicate that the Fiend Tomb had come under control.</p>
<p>If it were in the past, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have had any negative thoughts. He would have felt that this matter was over. However, when he recalled the scene of the girl he had seen, he felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>The scene I saw wasn’t an illusion. If I’m not wrong, it should be the ability Truth Listener gave me. Legend has it that Truth Listener can listen to the sounds of the world and hear the good and evil of the human heart. In other words, it has the ability to hear what the heart has to say. What I heard might very well be Zhang Yuzhi’s inner voice… Zhou Wen guessed.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, Zhou Wen could hear Zhang Yuzhi’s thoughts a moment ago, but he couldn’t hear anything now. He tried, but he couldn’t hear Zhang Chunqiu and the others’ thoughts. It made Zhou Wen suspect that his judgment was right. Perhaps it was really an illusion.</p>
<p>“My hearing hasn’t completely recovered. Can you let me rest here for two more days? I’ll leave after I recover.” Zhou Wen asked Zhang Chunqiu.</p>
<p>“I do wish for you to stay a few more days, but Yuzhi said that she doesn’t want to see you. When she sees you again, she will definitely lose her temper,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“What did you say?” Zhou Wen didn’t hear Zhang Chunqiu.</p>
<p>“I do wish for you to stay a few more days…” Zhang Chunqiu had no choice but to repeat himself.</p>
<p>However, just as he said that, Zhou Wen said, “I can’t stay for too long. I still have something to do when I return. A few days really won’t do. I’ll stay for another two days.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m saying that Yuzhi doesn’t want to see you. If she sees that you haven’t left, she will lose her temper again…” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“What? You will lose your temper? I really have something on. I can’t stay for too long. I can only stay for three days at most, not any longer…” As Zhou Wen spoke, he pulled Zhang Chunqiu out. As he walked, he said,” I never expected you to be so hospitable. If I had known this would happen, I would have come to you often in the past… You’re really too nice…”</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu looked at Zhou Wen, unsure if he really couldn’t hear him.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? Why hasn’t Zhou Wen left?” Zhang Xiao asked after Zhang Chunqiu and Zhou Wen separated.</p>
<p>“His hearing hasn’t recovered yet. He wants to stay another two to three more days,” Zhang Chunqiu answered.</p>
<p>“How can we have that? The day after tomorrow is…” Zhang Xiao stopped talking.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. Just ignore him,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“What the uncles mean is that they are afraid that Zhou Wen will hinder our matters. If anything happens, the Zhang family will never have peace. It’s best to let him leave early,” Zhang Xiao said.</p>
<p>“I don’t have the ability to chase him away, nor do I think he will hinder us. If you think there’s something wrong with him, chase him away yourself,” Zhang Chunqiu said as he turned around and left.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiao looked at Zhou Wen’s yard, but he didn’t dare really head over. All he could do was return and tell his elders Zhang Chunqiu’s words.</p>
<p>The Zhang family’s elders were also worried. If it were an ordinary person, the Zhang family could chase them away, but the person living in the Zhang family residence was Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The Zhang family knew Zhou Wen’s strength. If Zhou Wen didn’t leave, they wouldn’t dare use force to chase him out.</p>
<p>When the Eldest Uncle Zhang got Zhang Xiao to chase Zhou Wen away, Zhang Xiao hesitated for a moment before saying, “Uncle, I think Zhou Wen really just wants to recover his hearing before leaving. It probably has nothing to do with our Zhang family.”</p>
<p>Even Zhang Chunqiu couldn’t chase Zhou Wen away. What could he do?</p>
<p>“Forget it. He’s not a hindrance. Let him stay there.” In the end, it was Zhang Siyou who spoke. This matter was left unsettled.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1315'>Chapter 1315: Returning to the Fiend Tomb</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen attempted to enter that state again when back in his room.</p>
<p>In that state, he could directly hear the inner voice and even turn it into an image. As long as he had that ability, he might be able to figure out the truth from the Zhang family.</p>
<p>However, it was unknown if Truth Listener’s ability hadn’t truly reached that stage or if Zhou Wen’s strength wasn’t enough to match Truth Listener’s. In any case, he tried many times, but failed to enter that state again.</p>
<p>However, ever since he heard the inner voice, Zhou Wen’s ability to capture sounds improved significantly. Distance, proximity, and amplitude weren’t a problem for Zhou Wen. As long as he found the right channel, no matter how far away he was or how soft the voice was, Zhou Wen could hear it clearly on Earth even if someone was whispering on Venus.</p>
<p>Since he couldn’t accomplish telepathy, Zhou Wen wanted to see if he could find the Zhang family’s voice channel and eavesdrop on them.</p>
<p>This clearly wasn’t an easy task. When facing each other, Zhou Wen wasn’t able to accurately capture the sound. Furthermore, there were so many people in the Zhang family. Zhou Wen didn’t know which person’s words were useful, so it was easy to miss them.</p>
<p>With no other choice, Zhou Wen could only slowly try. After all, he had to practice controlling his hearing, so he just treated it as practice.</p>
<p>After listening for a long time, he occasionally heard some of the Zhang family’s conversations. They were just a few sentences, and some of them were just a few words. He didn’t discover anything useful.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only continue practicing. He realized that ever since he heard Zhang Yuzhi’s thoughts, his control over the sound he received had become stronger. He improved very quickly.</p>
<p>Outside the building, Eldest Uncle Zhang coughed and said, “Yuzhi, are you sleeping?”</p>
<p>“Uncle, what’s the matter?” Zhang Yuzhi opened the door and asked Eldest Uncle Zhang in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Nothing much. I just feel uncomfortable and want to chat with you,” Uncle Zhang said.</p>
<p>“Uncle, have a seat. I’ll pour you a cup of tea.” As Zhang Yuzhi spoke, she prepared to get the teapot.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. I’ll do it myself.” Eldest Uncle Zhang picked up the teapot and poured himself a cup, but he didn’t drink it.</p>
<p>Putting down the teapot, he sighed and said, “Yuzhi, it was really hard on you. If there was another way, we wouldn’t have agreed to her conditions. If it’s possible, I’d rather go in your stead. After all, I’m already old and useless. You are still young and talented. The Zhang family is still counting on you for the future.”</p>
<p>“Uncle, there’s no need to say anything. This is my life. I accept my fate. What she wants is me. I won’t implicate the family,” Zhang Yuzhi said with her head lowered.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by implicating? We are family,” Eldest Uncle Zhang said. “I only hate myself for being useless. I can’t replace you, nor can I save the Zhang family. Yuzhi, if you need anything, just tell me. Even if I have to risk my life, I will definitely help you complete it.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Uncle. I’m fine now. I don’t have any other needs.” Zhang Yuzhi shook her head.</p>
<p>“That’s fine. Just tell Uncle when you think of it.” Eldest Uncle Zhang paused and said excitedly, “Yuzhi, you know that this matter concerns the life and death of our clan. Nothing must go wrong. If anything happens, it’s fine for us old fellows to die. If something happens to Chunqiu and company, how can I answer to my ancestors in the netherworld? How can I face my ancestors…”</p>
<p>“Uncle, did something happen?” Zhang Yuzhi couldn’t help but frown when she heard Zhang Chunqiu’s name.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“What are you still doing here?” The next morning, just as Zhou Wen opened the door, he saw Zhang Yuzhi standing outside. It was unknown when she had arrived.</p>
<p>“What?” Zhou Wen looked at Zhang Yuzhi in puzzlement with a blank expression.</p>
<p>“I already told you to leave. Don’t stay here and annoy me. Why don’t you understand human language?” Zhang Yuzhi said again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen dug his ears and said helplessly, “My hearing is getting worse. What did you say?”</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi didn’t say a word as she pulled Zhou Wen’s hand and walked out. It looked like she wanted to forcefully pull him out of the Zhang family residence.</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhang Yuzhi was serious, Zhou Wen knew it was pointless to feign ignorance. He couldn’t just shake off Zhang Yuzhi’s hand and just insist on staying. He couldn’t bring himself to do such a thing.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over what to do, he suddenly realized that the sea of noises around him was gradually receding. He had once again entered a state where he could hear one’s inner thoughts.</p>
<p>I knew it. It was definitely not an illusion. Truth Listener’s power can really hear one’s inner thoughts. Zhou Wen was delighted as he hurriedly listened, hoping to know what he could hear.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen didn’t sense Zhang Yuzhi turn into a girl. She was still the same, but Zhou Wen heard two voices from her.</p>
<p>A voice came from her mouth. Zhou Wen could hear it, but he didn’t seem to remember it.</p>
<p>Another voice came from her. It was weak at first, but it later became clearer.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, leave. Don’t ever come back. Staying here will only harm you. I don’t wish to harm my friends again… I’m not worthy of being your friend either…” Zhou Wen’s expression turned odder as he listened.</p>
<p>“Quickly return. Stop fooling around.” Zhang Yuzhi pulled Zhou Wen out of the door and gritted her teeth. With that said, she turned around and returned. The Zhang family guards closed the door.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the tightly shut door and turned to leave.</p>
<p>When the Zhang family saw Zhou Wen really leave, many people heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>They weren’t afraid of Zhou Wen, but they were afraid that he would interfere with their matters.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu stood beside a stone pavilion and looked at Zhang Yuzhi who was sitting numbly in the garden. He couldn’t help but sigh.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Two days later, many people from the Zhang family were nervous. Many people left the Zhang family residence and headed for the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>At noon, a car was pushed out of the Zhang family residence.</p>
<p>The reason it was said to be pushed out wasn’t because the car was out of gas, but because it was a wooden carriage.</p>
<p>The wooden carriage’s design was very strange. Even the axle and wheels were made of wood. There was a white cloth that resembled a bed curtain covering the carriage. It was impossible to see inside.</p>
<p>If one could see through the white cloth, they would see that there was a black wooden coffin inside and many yellow paper talismans stuck to the coffin.</p>
<p>Under the protection of the Zhang family, the wooden carriage with the coffin was pushed all the way to the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>2</p>
<h3 id='chapter1316'>Chapter 1316: Drought Demon</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>If Zhou Wen saw the Fiend Tomb now, he would definitely be alarmed.</p>
<p>It could no longer be called a grave. Not only was there no grave, but there was also a bottomless pit.</p>
<p>The flames in the pit rose up as blazing white flames spewed out dozens of meters high. If not for the suppression of the Zhang family’s seal, the flames would have long surged into the sky, making it known to the world.</p>
<p>Even though it was suppressed by the seal, the flames were still unimaginably terrifying. It made the bottomless pit look like the entrance to hell. The constantly burning flames turned the surrounding rocks into crystalline objects that shimmered with a demonic light under the flames.</p>
<p>The wooden carriage stopped not far from the deep pit. Almost all the core members of the Zhang family had arrived. Under Zhang Siyou’s lead, they reached the edge of the seal.</p>
<p>The last time Zhou Wen had seen Zhang Siyou was only five years ago. If Zhou Wen saw him again, he probably wouldn’t recognize him.</p>
<p>Zhang Siyou looked much older now. It wasn’t that his face had changed much, but that his mental state looked terrible.</p>
<p>Zhang Siyou looked at the fiery pit that resembled the entrance to hell. He was in a daze for a while, as though he was in a trance.</p>
<p>“Family Head, it’s time to begin,” Eldest Uncle Zhang reminded. Although he was Zhang Siyou’s elder brother, he could only respectfully address him as family head.</p>
<p>Zhang Siyou seemed to wake from a dream with a start. He looked at the flaming pit again before retracting his gaze and turning to look at the wooden carriage.</p>
<p>All the Zhang family members looked at the wooden carriage with Zhang Siyou, their expressions extremely complicated.</p>
<p>“Family Head, it’s almost time,” Eldest Uncle Zhang reminded again.</p>
<p>“Whatever. Lower it,” Zhang Siyou said.</p>
<p>When Eldest Uncle Zhang heard that, he waved his hand. Eight members of the Zhang family immediately brought the coffin from the wooden carriage to them.</p>
<p>Zhang Siyou walked to the coffin and touched the yellow paper talismans on the coffin lid. He said with a strange expression, “Ever since the ancestral Celestial Master obtained the heavens’ teachings and established our Celestial Master lineage, the Zhang family has never suffered such humiliation.”</p>
<p>Eldest Uncle Zhang said, “Family Head, you can’t say that. Ever since the ancestral Celestial Master was around, our Zhang family has been embroiled with her. We have also been guarding the Fiend Tomb and have been severely affected by her aura. The Zhang family’s bloodline has already been seeded with demonic aura. This is the karma our Zhang family deserves. If she really returns to this world, all of our Zhang family members will be bedeviled. Yuzhi naturally won’t be an exception.”</p>
<p>Everyone from the Zhang family was depressed. Although Eldest Uncle Zhang was right—the Zhang family was deeply affected by the Drought Demon, and the Drought Demon could no longer be suppressed—they could no longer stop her return.</p>
<p>As long as the Drought Demon appeared, the Zhang family would be infected by the Fiend Tomb’s aura, having guarded the Fiend Tomb for so many years. The demonic nature hidden in their bodies would erupt. When that happened, they would become monsters that were neither human nor demonic.</p>
<p>After experiencing the corruption and heredity of the demonic aura for countless years, the demonic nature had already penetrated deep into the bones of the Zhang family. If the Drought Demon appeared, it would be useless even if the Zhang family fled to the ends of the world.</p>
<p>The Zhang family had been searching for a way to resolve this problem, but they didn’t have a good solution. With the Fiend Tomb changing day by day, Drought Demon was about to be resurrected once more.</p>
<p>Just as the Zhang family thought that they were really going to be wiped out, Drought Demon in the Fiend Tomb raised a condition to their surprise.</p>
<p>As long as Zhang Yuzhi fused with it, the demonic nature in the Zhang family’s body wouldn’t be triggered even if she was resurrected, allowing them to maintain their human nature.</p>
<p>It was a fusion, not a contract. This was unacceptable to many people in the Zhang family.</p>
<p>If it was a contract, at the very least, Zhang Yuzhi would still be alive. However, fusion was opposite of what Wang Mingyuan did when fusing with the Guardian. The Guardian would be the main body that fused with Zhang Yuzhi’s body.</p>
<p>Although the Drought Demon would still retain some of Zhang Yuzhi’s characteristics, its thoughts would be completely the Drought Demon’s. Zhang Yuzhi would be in a state no different from death.</p>
<p>However, reality was cruel. The entire family would die or only Zhang Yuzhi would die. Although this question was difficult, the answer was obvious.</p>
<p>“Family Head, let me send sis off one last time,” Zhang Chunqiu whispered.</p>
<p>“Can you do it?” Zhang Siyou was slightly taken aback as he asked Zhang Chunqiu.</p>
<p>The Zhang family doted on Zhang Yuzhi, and Zhang Chunqiu had the best relationship with her. Zhang Siyou originally didn’t want Zhang Chunqiu to come, but he had insisted on coming.</p>
<p>“I can. I want to accompany sis on this final journey,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“Let Chunqiu send her off. Chunqiu and Yuzhi have the best relationship. With Chunqiu sending her off, Yuzhi can feel more at ease,” Eldest Uncle Zhang persuaded.</p>
<p>In fact, Eldest Uncle Zhang was willing to speak up for Zhang Chunqiu because many people in the Zhang family didn’t agree with using Zhang Yuzhi to make a deal with the Drought Demon.</p>
<p>If Zhang Chunqiu, who had the best relationship with Zhang Yuzhi, personally sent her to the Drought Demon, the others would have nothing better to say.</p>
<p>“Go. No matter how difficult the path ahead is, you have to continue. Take care of yourself,” Zhang Siyou said as he patted Zhang Chunqiu on the shoulder.</p>
<p>“I understand. You too.” Zhang Chunqiu bowed respectfully before walking to the coffin. He stroked the coffin and said, “Sis, I’m here to send you off. I’ll accompany you on this final journey.”</p>
<p>With that said, Zhang Chunqiu lifted the coffin and placed it on his shoulder.</p>
<p>The people who had previously carried the coffin wanted to help, but Zhang Chunqiu stopped them. “I can do it myself.”</p>
<p>Then, Zhang Chunqiu carried the coffin and walked towards the flaming pit.</p>
<p>When the coffin reached the crystallized rock, the flames in the deep pit suddenly erupted, instantly burning the seal set by the Zhang family to ashes.</p>
<p>Thousands of yellow paper talismans rose in the flames and turned to ashes.</p>
<p>Blazing white flames shot into the sky like an aurora, illuminating the nearby mountains. At the same time, the scorching power cooked all the plants. Ordinary animals were no exception.</p>
<p>Amidst the flame pillar, a huge flower that seemed to be condensed from flames appeared.</p>
<p>The flower looked like a lotus flower, but it was somewhat different. Every petal was pure white and crystalline without any impurities. However, the immense power contained in them seemed to be able to turn the entire world into a flaming hell.</p>
<p>“Place her in the flower. My grudge with the Zhang family shall be written off. From now on, you don’t have to endure the pain of the demonic nature.” A strange woman’s voice sounded from the flaming pit.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu carried the coffin and stared at the flower. He said calmly, “Legend has it that the Drought Demon was originally a fairy who had once helped Yellow Emperor defeat Count of the Wind and Lord of the Rain. As she wasn’t able to return to the Heaven Realm in time, she ended up in the north. However, the power of fire from the Drought Demon Fairy was too powerful. Wherever she passed, she left scorched earth. As a result, she was cursed by the masses. In the end, the deities punished her, turning her into a corpse that was buried deep underground. From then on, she never saw the sun.”</p>
<p>“It’s just a legend.” The woman’s voice answered Zhang Chunqiu.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu nodded and continued, “In our Zhang family, there’s another legend.. Back when the ancestral Celestial Master died, he once said that if the Drought Demon wants to reincarnate, it has to satisfy three conditions. I wonder if that’s true?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1317'>Chapter 1317: Zhang Family</h3>
<p>“Chunqiu, what are you doing? Do what you have to do.” Eldest Uncle Zhang felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu ignored him. Without hearing the woman’s answer, he continued, “Stirring of the Earth fire, growth of the Corpse Flower, and the rise of the dead. Only with these three conditions can the Drought Demon Fairy be resurrected.”</p>
<p>“Even if I’m not resurrected, destroying the Zhang family will be as easy as flipping my hand.” Drought Demon Fairy’s voice finally sounded again. Her words seemed to tacitly affirm the three conditions Zhang Chunqiu mentioned.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu continued, “That’s natural. If you want to destroy my Zhang family, there’s no need to go through so much trouble. All you need to do is trigger the demonic nature in our bodies. However, I heard that the Earth fire is an extreme Yin flame. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that it’s the flames of hell. The Corpse Flower born amidst the Earth fire is the source of all Yin. It’s most compatible with your strength.</p>
<p>“You were suppressed here. One-half of you is suppressed, but the other half probably wants to use the Earth fire and Corpse Flower to advance further.”</p>
<p>“Are these also the last words of that Zhang fellow?” Drought Demon Fairy asked.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu didn’t answer as he continued, “From the looks of it, you have more or less succeeded. However, this extreme Yin power can’t break through the power of the rules. It’s not a power that should exist in this world. Therefore, you have to rely on a human’s body to descend into this world again.</p>
<p>“But this person isn’t an ordinary person. What you need is a physique that can withstand extreme Yin flames, but it can’t be of the pure Yin attribute. And this physique is extremely rare. Even in the Zhang family that has been invaded by demonic aura for countless years, I’m afraid only my sis has such a physique.”</p>
<p>“So what?” Drought Demon Fairy didn’t deny it.</p>
<p>“Therefore, no matter how strong you are, even if you can destroy our Zhang family without even moving a finger, if you can’t obtain my sister’s body, you won’t be able to truly stand tall in this world. You can only hide and live an abject life,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“Chunqiu, what are you doing?” Eldest Uncle Zhang’s voice was excited. Clearly, he was infuriated.</p>
<p>If Drought Demon Fairy was angered, the entire Zhang family—even the Zhang family’s children—who had been separated from the main family—would not be able to escape the calamity. This was because the demonic nature had already penetrated deep into the Zhang family’s genes.</p>
<p>“Family Head…” Seeing that Zhang Chunqiu was ignoring him, Eldest Uncle Zhang wanted Zhang Siyou to give the order to stop Zhang Chunqiu from spouting nonsense.</p>
<p>Zhang Siyou said indifferently, “Chunqiu is a child who knows his limits. He knows what to do and what not to do.”</p>
<p>Just as Eldest Uncle Zhang was about to say something, Drought Demon Fairy spoke again. All he could do was hold it back for the time being.</p>
<p>“You are right. Then, do you dare use the lives of your family to prevent my resurrection?” Drought Demon Fairy said indifferently.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t dare. I only have a small condition. If you are resurrected, my Zhang family did something after all. It’s not too much to make a small request, right?” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“Speak; what are your conditions?” Drought Demon Fairy asked.</p>
<p>“I want to contract you.” Zhang Chunqiu seemed to have already thought of it as he said it out loud.</p>
<p>“That really is a tiny request,” Drought Demon Fairy said sarcastically. “Don’t you know that once I fuse with a human’s body, I don’t need to contract with humans like ordinary Guardians? I can also break through the restrictions of Earth’s rules?”</p>
<p>“I know. You don’t need a contract, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t. My condition is that you have to contract with me and become my Guardian for up to ten years. You are free to make a choice of staying or leaving after ten years. Otherwise, even if the Zhang family is wiped out, you can forget about obtaining her,” Zhang Chunqiu said as he stroked the coffin.</p>
<p>“Zhang… Chun… Qiu…” Eldest Uncle Zhang was alarmed and furious. He never expected Zhang Chunqiu to have such plans. He was using the entire Zhang family’s lives to satisfy his selfish desires.</p>
<p>“Do you think you have the qualifications to negotiate with me?” Drought Demon Fairy asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Zhang Chunqiu said firmly. “If you can forcefully snatch her away, you wouldn’t need to negotiate with us. Since you are negotiating with us, we naturally have what it takes to negotiate, right?”</p>
<p>Whoosh!</p>
<p>The Earth fire suddenly expanded and instantly enveloped the nearby area. It wasn’t just Zhang Chunqiu. Everyone in the Zhang family was enveloped by the Earth fire.</p>
<p>Strangely, the Zhang family members weren’t burned to death. Even their clothes weren’t ignited. However, many of the Zhang family members’ hair and eyes began to turn white. Their fingernails also turned into jade as they rapidly grew.</p>
<p>Many members of the Zhang family hugged their heads and fell to the ground in agony. It was as though something was gnawing at their brains.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu was the first to bear the brunt. Others’ hair slowly turned white, but his hair instantly turned completely white. His eyes also turned jade-white. From afar, he looked like a blind man.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu’s body trembled violently, but he didn’t cry out tragically like the others. He didn’t collapse to the ground and hug his head to wail. He continued standing there with the coffin, silently enduring everything.</p>
<p>His hair, eyes, nails, and even his skin turned snow-white in the blazing white flames. Amidst the flames, even his life force seemed to be rapidly drained.</p>
<p>“You will die in thirty seconds.” Drought Demon Fairy’s voice sounded again like a lofty monarch.</p>
<p>“Chunqiu, stop fooling around. You will kill all of us…” Eldest Uncle Zhang endured the excruciating pain and wanted to rush over and replace Zhang Chunqiu to send the coffin into the Corpse Flower.</p>
<p>However, just as he stood up, he was stopped by Zhang Siyou.</p>
<p>“Second Brother, what are you doing? Do you want this to be the end of our Zhang family?” Eldest Uncle Zhang said angrily. He didn’t even call him family head.</p>
<p>Zhang Siyou said expressionlessly, “The Zhang family only has people who live standing, not ghosts who die on their knees. If conditions are negotiable, then it has to be fair. Since she’s taking someone from our Zhang family, she has to return one as well.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense. Go and capture Zhang Chunqiu,” Eldest Uncle Zhang ordered his trusted aides.</p>
<p>However, just as his trusted aides stepped forward, they were stopped by the Zhang family.</p>
<p>“You… Do you have a death wish?” Uncle Zhang was alarmed and furious.</p>
<p>“Our Zhang family had the ancestral Celestial Master and the Hero King. Just as the family head said, from ancient times, there are only Zhang family members who live as heroes. There shall not be any trash from the Zhang family who kneel before death. Even if we become the devil, the Zhang family members have to be the devil incarnate, not the devil’s lap dogs who live abject lives…” An old man from the Zhang family, who was on the brink of death, collapsed to the ground. He grabbed the walking stick with both hands and propped himself up. He shouted at Zhang Chunqiu, “Child, do your best. The Zhang family can be afraid of death, but we can’t be cowardly. Even if we die, we will die an honorable death. I’ll pave the way for you.”</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The elder raised his cane and smashed it on his head. Immediately, blood flowed down from his head and he died on the spot.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1318'>Chapter 1318: Not Necessarily</h3>
<p>“Do you want to see the Zhang family wiped out?” Drought Demon Fairy’s voice sounded again.</p>
<p>“Twenty years.” Zhang Chunqiu’s voice remained as firm as steel. “Every death of the Zhang family adds ten years. You have to return what you have taken from the Zhang family.”</p>
<p>“You still have ten seconds.” Drought Demon Fairy’s cold voice wafted over again.</p>
<p>Time ticked by, but Zhang Chunqiu remained unmoved. He pressed his palm on the coffin and calmly muttered to himself, “Sis, I’ll accompany you in the journey of death.”</p>
<p>Just as Zhang Chunqiu was about to be demonized and he was about to destroy the coffin, the surrounding Earth fire suddenly converged. Although the Zhang family didn’t recover from the symptoms of the demonic transformation, it didn’t worsen.</p>
<p>“Twenty years. I’ll permit it.” Drought Demon Fairy ultimately submitted. Just as Zhang Chunqiu had said, if she had the ability to snatch Zhang Yuzhi away, she wouldn’t have negotiated with the Zhang family.</p>
<p>Killing Zhang Yuzhi was easy, but to fuse with her required Zhang Yuzhi’s willing cooperation. If she really killed all the Zhang family members, it would be impossible for Zhang Yuzhi to fuse with her willingly.</p>
<p>“Then make an oath.” Zhang Chunqiu remained calm. He didn’t feel any joy from escaping death.</p>
<p>“Do you really have a death wish?” Drought Demon Fairy said coldly.</p>
<p>“I just don’t want to die for no reason,” Zhang Chunqiu said indifferently.</p>
<p>“I, Drought Demon, swear on my name that I’m willing to contract with this human for twenty years. If I violate this oath, I will incur the world’s contempt.” Drought Demon ultimately couldn’t resist the temptation of escaping and made the oath.</p>
<p>“Sis, don’t blame me. I had no choice.” After hearing Drought Demon Fairy’s oath, Zhang Chunqiu walked towards the Corpse Flower with the coffin.</p>
<p>The Corpse Flower was snow-white and crystalline. It looked spotless, but it emitted a demonic aura that left one shuddering.</p>
<p>Eldest Uncle Zhang finally heaved a sigh of relief. Although the process was harrowing, the Zhang family was finally safe. Furthermore, to be able to contract an existence like Drought Demon for twenty years, the Zhang family’s meteoric rise was only a matter of time.</p>
<p>In the future, he might even become the true ruler of Earth, not just one of the six hero families.</p>
<p>At that moment, Eldest Uncle Zhang suddenly felt that although Zhang Chunqiu’s actions were too risky, he had obtained huge benefits.</p>
<p>Under everyone’s gaze, Zhang Chunqiu carried the coffin to the Corpse Flower and slowly placed the coffin on it.</p>
<p>Just as the Corpse Flower was about to devour the coffin and Uncle Zhang believed that it was finally over, he suddenly saw a golden glow in Zhang Chunqiu’s hand.</p>
<p>“Supreme Venerable Sovereign… be quick, as if this were a command… Limitless Heaven and Earth… Borrowing from the Universe… Heavenly Five Thunders…” Zhang Chunqiu’s white hair and clothes fluttered. He still had the protection of a spirit as the yellow paper talisman in his hand emitted a golden glow.</p>
<p>He was just too close to the Corpse Flower. No one could stop him in time. The moment the yellow paper talisman that emitted a golden light touched the Corpse Flower that was inches away, golden lightning erupted.</p>
<p>The golden lightning carried an extreme Yang force that instantly charred the Corpse Flower into ashes.</p>
<p>Eldest Uncle Zhang’s mouth gaped open. He was dumbfounded. He muttered to himself nervously, “No… No… Impossible… How can this be… No… Impossible… We can’t die… We can’t die…”</p>
<p>Many people from the Zhang family were also alarmed. They never expected Zhang Chunqiu to dare do such a thing. No one knew that Zhang Chunqiu would do such a thing.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Siyou seemed to feel relieved. The Celestial Master Five Thunders Talisman that the ancestral Celestial Master had left behind was something he had given to Zhang Chunqiu to protect him. Zhang Chunqiu had used it to destroy the Corpse Flower. Although he hadn’t informed Zhang Siyou, Zhang Siyou felt that this was how the usual Zhang Chunqiu acted. Although he knew that the Zhang family would not be able to escape calamity, he wasn’t to be blamed.</p>
<p>“Do you know what you have done?” Drought Demon Fairy’s cold voice sounded.</p>
<p>“Stirring of the Earth fire, growth of the Corpse Flower, and rise of the dead. None of the three conditions can be missing. Now that you don’t have the Corpse Flower, it’s useless even if you rise from the dead. All I know is that you can’t be resurrected.” Zhang Chunqiu remained calm.</p>
<p>“Your rashness will cost the entire Zhang family,” Drought Demon Fairy said again.</p>
<p>“Death? It doesn’t matter. I’ve already done what I wanted. Even if everyone in the Zhang family dies, one person won’t die and that’s enough…” Zhang Chunqiu’s white robe fluttered as he pressed his hands on the coffin. A net-like golden light filled the coffin, causing it to instantly disappear.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid death is only an extravagant hope for you.” Accompanying Drought Demon Fairy’s voice, the Earth fire expanded again and enveloped the Zhang family.</p>
<p>“Go. Go as far as we can.” Although Zhang Siyou knew that escaping was useless, it was better than standing there and waiting for death.</p>
<p>Some of the members of the Zhang family fled. Some were still hesitating when they saw their seventh great-uncle, who had committed suicide, crawl up from the ground. He wiped the blood from his head and quickly flew back. As he flew, he shouted, “What are you waiting for? Why aren’t you running? It’s always the Zhang family who busts ghosts. Do you want to become ghosts?”</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned before they were overjoyed and fled with their seventh granduncle.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, although they fled quickly, how could they be faster than an existence like Drought Demon Fairy? As they flew into the sky, the Earth fire had already enveloped them.</p>
<p>Many Zhang family members fell to the ground. Their hair, skin, nails, and pupils rapidly turned white as they demonized.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu didn’t escape. He knew that he couldn’t escape either. As he looked at the Zhang family members who had been painfully demonized, Zhang Chunqiu felt somewhat guilty, but he didn’t regret his decision.</p>
<p>He had done what he wanted to do and saved the person he wanted to save. It was enough for the Zhang family to have one person live, and one who wasn’t affected by the demonic nature.</p>
<p>“Everyone in the Zhang family will become devils because of your actions. They will no longer have any human feelings. They will neither be human or ghost. They will devour blood like their lives depend on it and feed on their own kind… Do you regret sacrificing everyone for just one person?” Drought Demon Fairy asked coldly.</p>
<p>“Despite knowing the bedevilment, there are things that need to be done. What’s there to regret?” Zhang Chunqiu said calmly.</p>
<p>“Is that so? Some people might not think so.” Drought Demon Fairy seemed to be implying something.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu’s expression changed slightly. This was because he had already seen Zhang Yuzhi, who he had sent away using the Five Ghosts Transfer, walk back.</p>
<p>“Yuzhi, don’t come over. Leave this place immediately.” Zhang Chunqiu wanted to rush towards Zhang Yuzhi, but his body had been severely demonized. He fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi looked at the Zhang family members who had turned into ghostly demons. As she walked over, she cried and said, “Brother, if I live like this, my life will be more painful than death.”</p>
<p>“Fool, it’s useless even if you return now. Without the Corpse Flower, Drought Demon can’t be resurrected. She won’t let us off either. You will be sending yourself to death for nothing by returning…” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“Not necessarily.” Drought Demon Fairy’s voice was filled with mockery. As she spoke, a Corpse Flower condensed in the flames again.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1319'>Chapter 1319: Spare Your Life</h3>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu’s face instantly turned ashen as he looked at Zhang Yuzhi in despair.</p>
<p>“Yuzhi… Don’t…” Zhang Chunqiu tried his best to stand up and stop Zhang Yuzhi, but his body had been severely demonized. He couldn’t even stand up.</p>
<p>“You only want me. Let them go and I’ll agree to fuse with you,” Zhang Yuzhi said.</p>
<p>“Of course. To me, they are no different from ants by the side of the road. There won’t be any benefits even if I stomp them to death, but there won’t be any harm either. As long as you fuse with me, I guarantee you their safety and recovery,” Drought Demon Fairy said.</p>
<p>“Child, go. You’ve done enough for the Zhang family. Now, you are the only one in the entire Zhang family who isn’t affected by the demonic nature. You are the only person in the Zhang family that should live,” Zhang Siyou said.</p>
<p>“Yuzhi… No…” Zhang Chunqiu’s eyes were filled with despair. This was because he knew that with Zhang Yuzhi’s personality, it was impossible for her to leave now.</p>
<p>“Brother, I’ve been a jinx to begin with. I should have died a long time ago. I’m satisfied to be able to do something for you in the end.” Zhang Yuzhi walked towards the Corpse Flower with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>“No…” Zhang Chunqiu struggled with all his might. His fingers pressed against the ground, almost to the point of snapping. The blood at his fingertips dyed the ground.</p>
<p>Zhang Siyou and company were also shouting at the top of their voices, but they couldn’t stop Zhang Yuzhi from walking towards the Corpse Flower.</p>
<p>“The one who deserves death isn’t you, but the people who made you cry.” A voice sounded from nearby.</p>
<p>Everyone was taken aback as they turned to look in the direction of the voice. They saw an armored figure that seemed to be bathed in light walk towards the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>“Human… Human Sovereign…” Immediately, someone recognized the figure and couldn’t help but be overjoyed.</p>
<p>The Prisoned Dragon armor on Zhou Wen and the Immortal Culling Sword at his waist were too eye-catching. Almost everyone on Earth knew them.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi turned to look at Zhou Wen. When she saw him clearly, she was slightly taken aback. Her eyes were filled with pleasant surprise and an odd feeling.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked over step by step into the Earth fire. The strange Earth fire didn’t cause any damage to his body as though it didn’t exist.</p>
<p>He walked past Zhang Yuzhi and towards the Corpse Flower. As Zhou Wen walked, he held the hilt of the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Drought Demon Fairy’s voice sounded from the deep pit.</p>
<p>“Someone who finds you a sore sight and wants to kill you,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Why are humans always so ignorant? Why do they always say such arrogant things?” Drought Demon Fairy’s voice was filled with anger, as though she was really angry.</p>
<p>“That’s because there are too many idiots. They won’t understand if you don’t speak clearly.” With every step Zhou Wen took, the sword intent over his body intensified. At that moment, the sword intent was already unimaginably powerful. Before the Immortal Culling Sword was unsheathed, the sword intent seemed to condense into something corporeal, as though it wanted to split the ground apart.</p>
<p>Amidst the flames, a figure appeared. The Corpse Flower automatically flew towards the figure’s glabella and vanished in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>The figure was wearing a white dress and a white veil. It was impossible to tell what she looked like, but from her voice, she was undoubtedly Drought Demon Fairy.</p>
<p>“Even in the Mythical Era where Calamity entities were everywhere, no one dared to speak to me like that.” Drought Demon Fairy’s eyes turned cold. Clearly, she was infuriated by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll be clearer. If you can withstand my strike without dying, I’ll spare your life. I’ll permit you to continue being imprisoned in the Fiend Tomb,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Die!” The already enraged Drought Demon Fairy transformed the flames over her body into a monstrous aura that filled the entire sky with flames. It was as though the entire world was only left with flames.</p>
<p>Infinite heavenly flames scorched everything within.</p>
<p>The Drought Demon Fairy’s flames could incinerate everything. They weren’t inferior to the Sun True Flames and were even more bizarre and terrifying.</p>
<p>As she watched the towering flames devour the world and suppress Human Sovereign, Human Sovereign’s glowing figure seemed to become much smaller under the flames.</p>
<p>The Zhang family was worried if Human Sovereign could withstand the heavenly fire of Drought Demon. It was a terrifying flame that could defeat the two gods, Count of the Wind and Lord of the Rain.</p>
<p>“You… Don’t…” Zhang Yuzhi’s expression was mixed as though she wanted to say something.</p>
<p>However, before she could finish her sentence, Zhou Wen had already unsheathed his sword.</p>
<p>At the instant the Immortal Culling Sword was unsheathed, everything in the world seemed to freeze. The rainbow-like sword beam sliced through everything in the void, splitting the heavenly flames into two as though it was slicing apart the sky.</p>
<p>A single sword cleaved through the nine heavens.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi and company only saw a sword flash. The sky that was covered by the heavenly fire split into two, revealing the originally clear sky.</p>
<p>When they looked at Drought Demon again, they saw a purple magma-like liquid appear over her snow-white clothes..</p>
<p>The purple liquid dripped to the ground, each drop carrying scorching hot energy. The crystals that came into contact with them would immediately be burned through, forming a deep, indiscernible hole. It was unknown what depth it reached.</p>
<p>“Drought Demon is injured!” The Zhang family was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>They were delighted that the Zhang family might be saved, but they were alarmed that Human Sovereign had injured the legendary Drought Demon with one strike. He lived up to his title of the strongest human.</p>
<p>If he delivered a few more strikes, wouldn’t he be able to kill Drought Demon Fairy?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed. He originally wanted to use the Immortal Slaying and the power of the Immortal Culling Sword to severely injure Drought Demon Fairy or even kill her.</p>
<p>However, his strike only injured her, not causing her any severe injuries, much less killing her. Zhou Wen could sense that Drought Demon Fairy wasn’t seriously injured.</p>
<p>As expected of the legendary Drought Demon Fairy. She’s just too strong. Zhou Wen marveled inwardly.</p>
<p>Drought Demon Fairy’s eyes emitted a ferocious glint as she glared at Zhou Wen as though she wanted to eat him.</p>
<p>Even in the Mythical era, she had never been injured when fighting other powerful Guardians and dimensional creatures. Yet, she had been injured by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Although part of the reason was that she had yet to fuse with humans and was severely suppressed by the rules of Earth, preventing her from fully unleashing her strength, Drought Demon Fairy still couldn’t tolerate such an outcome. Her killing intent surged as she steeled her heart to kill Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Drought Demon Fairy was naturally someone who could identify the strong. She could tell that the Immortal Culling Sword was extraordinary and felt some fear.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen knew that the Immortal Culling Sword was just a decoration in his hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hung the Immortal Culling Sword back on his waist and glanced at Drought Demon Fairy and spoke seemingly casually, “It’s quite rare to endure my strike without dying. It’s not easy to evolve to this stage. It’s a pity to kill you. I’ll spare your life.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s words filled Drought Demon Fairy’s chest with such anger that she almost blew up. Even in the Mythical era with countless experts, no one had dared to speak to her like that.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1320'>Chapter 1320: Ba Killing Technique</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen had attempted to anger the Drought Demon Fairy from the beginning. It was not because he was really arrogant, nor did he really believe that he could surpass a Calamity-grade creature.</p>
<p>It was true that the Immortal Culling Sword was very strong, but Zhou Wen was too weak. He wasn’t able to utilize all of the Immortal Culling Sword’s abilities. It was fine if he occasionally delivered a strike, but if he failed, he basically didn’t have the ability to continue fighting.</p>
<p>The reason why he wanted to anger Drought Demon Fairy from the beginning was because of Truth Listener’s ability.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had basically figured out Truth Listener’s ability. Just as he had imagined, Truth Listener could indeed hear people’s thoughts.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t perfect. Under normal circumstances, one couldn’t hear the other party’s thoughts. Only when the other party’s emotions were especially intense could he hear their thoughts.</p>
<p>Drought Demon Fairy had never been the victim of such wrath. At that moment, her emotions were in extreme undulation. Zhou Wen finally felt the voices around him gradually dissipate. Although Drought Demon Fairy didn’t say a word, a voice sounded from her body.</p>
<p>I want to roast him inch by inch. I want him to experience all the pain in the world until he begs for death and regrets being born into this world… However, the sword in his hand is a little odd. It can actually injure me… I can’t leave the Fiend Tomb without fusing with a human due to the suppression of Earth’s rules… Drought Demon Fairy didn’t say a word, but her thoughts betrayed everything to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately overjoyed when he heard Drought Demon Fairy’s inner thoughts. However, his face remained unperturbed as he wore a composed look.</p>
<p>He had plans of escaping if he couldn’t fight the Calamity grade creature after his single strike failed and Truth Listener couldn’t be summoned.</p>
<p>At best, he could escape with Zhang Yuzhi. With a limit to his abilities, that was all he could do.</p>
<p>He immediately felt relieved knowing that Drought Demon Fairy couldn’t fully unleash her full combat strength due to her inability to leave the Fiend Tomb and the suppression by Earth’s rules.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, Since you can’t come out and can’t use your full strength, and I can hear your thoughts, this matter might still be feasible.</p>
<p>At that moment, Drought Demon Fairy was calculating in her heart. That sword is somewhat strange. It can even slice through my Drought Demon Body. It’s really impressive. However, that human’s strength shouldn’t have reached the Calamity grade yet. He only borrowed the power of the sword. I don’t have to fight that sword. As long as I kill that human, the sword will naturally be useless.</p>
<p>Drought Demon Fairy sized up Zhou Wen and thought to herself, I can’t leave, but if I use a large area of Heavenly Fire, it might be too slow and incapable of injuring him. From the looks of it, I can only expend some of my Intrinsic True Essence and use the Ba killing technique to kill that human.</p>
<p>Drought Demon Fairy stared at Zhou Wen as her Essence Energy flowed towards her fingers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sensed the gradual weakening of Drought Demon Fairy’s inner voice. He knew that it had been a while, and her emotions were gradually stabilizing. Therefore, he continued provoking her. “Why are you still standing there? I already told you that I’ll spare your life since I can’t kill you with one strike. However, although you can be spared from death, a punishment still needs to be meted out. Return to the Fiend Tomb and reflect on your mistakes. As long as I’m alive, you’ll never be resurrected. Go.”</p>
<p>Drought Demon Fairy’s anger was instantly stirred up by Zhou Wen despite having already calmed her emotions.</p>
<p>She was a hot-tempered person to begin with. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been able to defeat two terrifying existences like Count of the Wind and Lord of the Rain alone in the Mythical era.</p>
<p>However, it was also because of that battle that Drought Demon Fairy was severely injured. She had no choice but to recuperate in the Earth fire. Later on, she was sealed by the Zhang family’s ancestral Celestial Master.</p>
<p>Ba killing technique… Die… Drought Demon Fairy was already enraged. One of her hands turned invisible as she grabbed at the void.</p>
<p>At the instant Drought Demon Fairy attacked, Zhou Wen’s figure gracefully moved to the side. After he moved away, the rocks that had turned to crystals beneath him suddenly split apart. A cylindrical crystal several meters in diameter was pulled out of the crystal.</p>
<p>The crystal pillar was pulled hundreds of meters high before it strangely vanished. All that was left was a circular hole that was hundreds of meters deep.</p>
<p>Drought Demon Fairy was alarmed. Her Ba killing technique was unique. It killed people without any warning. The enemy wouldn’t sense any attack and it would be too late to escape when the Ba killing technique showed itself.</p>
<p>Previously, Drought Demon Fairy had relied on her Ba killing technique to dominate the world. She had killed countless terrifying Guardians and dimensional creatures, making people tremble in fear at the sound of her name. The name Drought Demon was synonymous with death.</p>
<p>Even if there were people who could withstand it, they were powerful beings who were in the extreme minority. Almost all of them were invincible powerhouses of their era, but most of them could only barely withstand the Ba-Killing Technique.</p>
<p>Drought Demon Fairy only had one person in her memories who could dodge it like Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Could this fellow be related to that empress? Drought Demon Fairy sized up Zhou Wen in surprise.</p>
<p>However, from the Essence Energy fluctuations emitted by Zhou Wen, he didn’t have any similarities to the one in Drought Demon Fairy’s recollection. Or rather, they were two completely different powers. They had nothing to do with each other.</p>
<p>Is it a coincidence? Drought Demon Fairy activated her Ba killing technique again.</p>
<p>Drought Demon Fairy never expected that the reason Zhou Wen could dodge her Ba killing technique was because of her inner thoughts. She had already told Zhou Wen the timing and location of the Ba killing technique. All Zhou Wen needed to do was dodge it ahead of time.</p>
<p>If he only relied on his senses, Zhou Wen wouldn’t be able to dodge the Ba killing technique.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally dodged Drought Demon Fairy’s Ba killing technique again.</p>
<p>Impossible… Drought Demon Fairy was alarmed when she saw Zhou Wen successfully dodge again.</p>
<p>“I’ve said it before. If you can withstand one strike of mine and survive, I’ll spare your life. However, if you insist on courting death, I can fulfill your wish.” Zhou Wen slowly walked towards Drought Demon Fairy. As he walked, he said, “If you haven’t returned to reflect on yourself by the time I reach the Fiend Tomb, there’s no need for you to return.”</p>
<p>Drought Demon Fairy was alarmed and furious. She steeled her heart and struck out repeatedly with her Ba killing technique.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for her, Zhou Wen had already heard all her thoughts. It even formed an image in his mind, allowing him to know where her next strike would land.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen’s figure floated like an immortal as though he was taking a stroll. Every step he took happened to dodge Drought Demon Fairy’s Ba killing technique. Drought Demon Fairy’s crazy attacks failed to touch Zhou Wen at all.</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhou Wen had already arrived in front of the Fiend Tomb, Drought Demon Fairy was extremely alarmed. Could it be that he really has a great divine power? He’s so powerful that he has hidden all that power deep down, preventing me from telling… Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to easily dodge my Ba killing technique… It’s like he can predict the future…</p>
<p>The way Zhou Wen dodged the Ba killing technique made Drought Demon Fairy think of the empress. Although their Essence Energy fluctuations were completely different, the way they dodged the Ba killing technique was very similar.. This only served to alarm her even more.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1321'>Chapter 1321: I’ll Wait for the Day You Die</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>The people of the Zhang family saw that Human Sovereign did not even draw his sword—he just walked casually and resolved Drought Demon Fairy’s ghostly attack. They were thrilled.</p>
<p>However, some people did not agree with Human Sovereign’s actions. They felt that Human Sovereign should not have been soft-hearted. He should have just killed Drought Demon Fairy. There was no need to give her a chance. This was equivalent to allowing a tiger to return to the mountain.</p>
<p>Drought Demon Fairy was confused. If the person in front of her was really strong, why did he bother spouting all that nonsense with her? He could have just drawn his sword and killed her. Why did he give her a chance?</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen walking over step by step, Drought Demon Fairy remained hesitant. After all, she was once an invincible existence. In that era, humans were inferior to ants in front of her. She traveled a thousand kilometers in a day, not sparing them a glance wherever she passed. Tens of thousands of humans were burned to ashes by the Heavenly Fire from her body, and that was just a result of her unconscious actions.</p>
<p>Yet in this era, she had to admit defeat to a human and reflect on her mistakes. She could not take this lying down.</p>
<p>Drought Demon Fairy felt that even if Human Sovereign really had the ability to kill her, it would just be a fight to the death. It was simply a wishful dream of others to make her bow her head before a human.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen didn’t really want to kill Drought Demon Fairy. He didn’t have the ability even if he really wanted to kill her.</p>
<p>Truth Listener’s ability could scare Drought Demon Fairy and make her think twice, but if they really came to blows, he was no match for her.</p>
<p>Drought Demon Fairy showed no intention of returning to the Fiend Tomb despite him being only a few steps from the Fiend Tomb and closing in.</p>
<p>Three steps… two steps… one step…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already standing in front of the Fiend Tomb, but Drought Demon Fairy still had no intention of returning. She continued attacking, clearly determined to risk her life.</p>
<p>Seeing this, the Zhang family felt that Human Sovereign had no choice but to fight Drought Demon Fairy. They even looked forward to seeing whether Human Sovereign could kill her.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s hand grabbed the hilt of the Immortal Culling Sword again, but he didn’t pull it out. Instead, he sighed softly and said regretfully, “I am supreme in the world. All the gods and devils in the world want to worship me. Do you think I can’t accept your bow?”</p>
<p>Everyone from the Zhang family was slightly taken aback when they heard Zhou Wen’s sudden words. Although Human Sovereign was powerful and was publicly acknowledged as the number one expert of humanity, it was a little overboard for him to claim supremacy and that all the gods and devils in the world had to worship him. It was too arrogant.</p>
<p>Moreover, anyone could tell that Drought Demon Fairy was prepared to fight to the death. How could she bow before him?</p>
<p>However, when Drought Demon Fairy heard that, her body trembled as she stared at Zhou Wen in disbelief.</p>
<p>She was all too familiar with those words. Back then, the empress had also stood before her and said those same words.</p>
<p>Although she couldn’t see Zhou Wen’s face, Zhou Wen’s tone and expression when he spoke resembled the empress back then. Only she and that empress were present back when it happened. No one else would have known.</p>
<p>For a moment, Drought Demon Fairy felt her thoughts go adrift, as if she was seeing the empress again.</p>
<p>“Why are you still standing there? Are you waiting for me to send you off?” Zhou Wen had only said that because he had read her thoughts and knew about her encounter with the empress.</p>
<p>These words struck Drought Demon like lightning. She looked at Zhou Wen with a complicated expression as though she had seen a ghost.</p>
<p>Something unexpected happened. Drought Demon Fairy, who was ready to fight to the death, gave Human Sovereign a perfunctory bow that showed no signs of reverence and disappeared into the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>The Earth fire that soared into the sky also quickly converged with the disappearance of Drought Demon Fairy. In a moment, the flames that filled the sky returned to the Fiend Tomb. Only a voice echoed in the sky. “I’ll wait for the day you die.”</p>
<p>Zhang Siyou and the others were shocked. Drought Demon Fairy’s words were no different from acknowledging what Human Sovereign had previously said. She would not seek resurrection as long as Human Sovereign was alive.</p>
<p>With Drought Demon Fairy’s return to the Fiend Tomb, the Zhang family’s demonization showed signs of amelioration, but they didn’t fully recover. Especially those who had been seriously demonized like Zhang Chunqiu, they didn’t show much change. Their hair remained white, and their eyes and nails were as white as jade.</p>
<p>Their complexions just looked much better, no longer as pale as a corpse like before.</p>
<p>“The Zhang family is unable to repay your kindness. If you need the Zhang family’s help in the future, just say the word. As long as it doesn’t violate human ethics, I, Zhang Siyou, will definitely be there.” Zhang Siyou only said his name, but did not mention the Zhang family.</p>
<p>Although his words sounded like he was avoiding the crux of the matter, on the other hand, it sounded like a serious promise.</p>
<p>“I hope the Zhang family can do as you say in the future—a Zhang family that lives standing on their feet.” After Zhou Wen said that, he glanced at Eldest Uncle Zhang before turning around and tearing through the air, instantly transforming into a stream of light that vanished.</p>
<p>Eldest Uncle Zhang’s face flushed red. He was undoubtedly the representative of the Zhang family who wanted to live on his knees.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi helped up Zhang Chunqiu as she looked in the direction where Zhou Wen had vanished as though in thought.</p>
<p>“Human Sovereign is really beyond our reach. In the past, I felt that Human Sovereign was just one step ahead of me. Sooner or later, I would be able to reach the same level as him. From the looks of it today, it’s not just one step.” Zhang Chunqiu praised before smiling. “Thankfully, that’s the case. Otherwise, our Zhang family would be doomed. Human Sovereign is indeed interesting. I wonder if his true identity is pure human. If he’s pure human, he really deserves the title Human Sovereign.”</p>
<p>“Probably… yes…” There was a complicated look in Zhang Yuzhi’s eyes as though she was somewhat distracted.</p>
<p>On the way back, Zhang Yuzhi suddenly thought of something. She took out her phone and sent a message.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was riding the Earth Elemental Beast when he arrived at a place where there was reception. When he heard the message chime, he took out his phone to take a look.</p>
<p>He saw that it was from Zhang Yuzhi and almost fell off the Earth Elemental Beast’s back when he opened the message.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty Human Sovereign… Come help me garden… and listen to my music next time…</p>
<p>It should be a guess, right? Zhou Wen was alarmed and puzzled. He didn’t know how Zhang Yuzhi could tell that he was Human Sovereign, so he hurriedly replied: “You sent it to the wrong person, right? You know Human Sovereign?”</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen sent the message, he nervously waited for Zhang Yuzhi’s reply. However, after waiting for a while, his message was like a rock sinking into the sea. There was no response at all.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi looked at Zhou Wen’s reply on her phone and revealed a sly smile. She closed the chat box and held her phone to her chest. She closed her eyes and muttered to herself with a smile, “With you around, I won’t be afraid of the darkness anymore.”</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi’s mind kept echoing the words: “The one who deserves death isn’t you, but the people who made you cry.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1322'>Chapter 1322: Luck Companion Egg</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>After waiting for a long time, Zhou Wen finally received a message. It wasn’t from Zhang Yuzhi, but Hui Haifeng.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, I’ve obtained all the lucky Companion Beasts I can. Take a look and see if it’s enough.” Behind Hui Haifeng’s message was a list of names.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a look and realized that there were a total of eleven different Luck Companion Eggs. Two of them were at the Mythical stage, six were at the Epic stage, and two were at the Legendary stage. There was even one at the Mortal stage.</p>
<p>“Mortal Companion Beasts are already very rare, and it actually has a Luck stat. This is really rare. However, even if a Mortal Companion Beast adds Luck, it shouldn’t add much, right?” Zhou Wen replied: “That’s enough. Give me two days to prepare and I’ll contact you when I’m done.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need. Just stay in Luoyang. I’ve already sent the men over and the Companion Beasts will come with them. They should be able to reach Luoyang tonight.” Hui Haifeng replied.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen didn’t insist. His entry into the Venusian dimensional zone didn’t depend on his location as long as there was a Cube.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, I’m handing them over to you. They’re my best men. Don’t lose them.” Hui Haifeng sent another message.</p>
<p>“Actually, I can enter alone.” Zhou Wen felt that it was safer for him to be alone.</p>
<p>“Alright, then you have to wear the Federation uniform. Then, wear a small red flag over your head which says ‘Federation Soldier’ on it…” Hui Haifeng replied.</p>
<p>“I think it’s better I take others along.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that it wasn’t an image he wanted to be associated with.</p>
<p>“Hehe, whatever you say. I spent a huge sum of money obtaining these lucky Companion Beasts for you. I believe no one can gather such a powerful lineup of lucky Companion Beasts again. Why do you need so many? According to what I know, although lucky Companion Beasts can increase the chances of obtaining dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs in some way, this possibility actually has a threshold value. Once it exceeds a certain luck value, no matter how many lucky Companion Beasts you equip, it won’t increase much,” Hui Haifeng asked curiously.</p>
<p>“You’ll know in the future.” Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to talk nonsense with him. He wanted to rush back to Luoyang to see the lucky Companion Beasts. This was because ordinary people could only rely on the information and experience transmitted by the Companion Beasts to determine their stats. They couldn’t see any accurate information.</p>
<p>Therefore, Hui Haifeng only knew that they were Companion Beasts with Luck augmentation, but he wasn’t sure how much Luck would be added.</p>
<p>“Master…” Just as Zhou Wen returned to Luoyang’s An family, he saw Hui Wan rush over.</p>
<p>“Why are you here?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised that Hui Haifeng was willing to let Hui Wan come over.</p>
<p>Now that there were broken-out dimensional zones everywhere on the road, it was difficult to guarantee safety. Hui Wan could be said to be the future hope of the Hui family. It was too risky to let him out now.</p>
<p>“Father agreed to let me come when I said I wanted to learn from you,” Hui Wan said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, Learn from me? What can you learn from me? It’s more like me learning from you.</p>
<p>Hui Wan’s talent was extremely high. He could grasp concepts from learning things once. Things like an eidetic memory and speed reading were nothing to him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suspected that Hui Haifeng had used some advanced technology to produce such a brainy son.</p>
<p>Back when Zhou Wen was in the Hui family, he had taught Hui Wan, but most of the things he knew could only be understood and not instructed. Zhou Wen had already taught him everything that could be instructed. Now, he really didn’t have anything left to teach.</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou, these are the items the president instructed us to bring you. Please check them.” An officer in his thirties came in front of Zhou Wen with a few officers.</p>
<p>He looked very strange as he wore zero facial expression. His eyebrows, beard, and facial features looked fake, but Zhou Wen was certain that it was just a feeling. There was no special disguise on his face. He just had such looks.</p>
<p>There were eleven of them, and each of them had a safe handcuffed to their wrist.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t need to guess to know that they were the eleven Luck Companion Eggs that Hui Haifeng had sent over. These eleven officers were likely Hui Haifeng’s men.</p>
<p>When the officers opened the safes, they used the keys they had to open the safes for the others. And in the safe, there were special devices that seemed to be able to destroy the Companion Eggs in the safes if they were touched.</p>
<p>It was understandable that Hui Haifeng would do such a thing. Although these Companion Eggs weren’t of high levels, they were very valuable. He had to be careful.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen took receipt of the items, the expressionless officer who looked like he was wearing a mask said, “Under the president’s orders, we will obey your orders from now on, Mr. Zhou. Even if you want us to die, we will definitely carry out your orders immediately.”</p>
<p>“Very good. Go back and rest.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes sir.” The soldier didn’t ask further and directly led his men back to rest.</p>
<p>“Master, the things that the coaches at home teach are so boring. I’ve long wanted to find you. What can you teach me?” Hui Wan asked as he followed behind Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“You’ve already done a good job with your learning. Play for the next two days,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Master, I know that you know things in depth. I might not be able to learn them now, but I’ll definitely work hard…” Hui Wan said with a serious expression.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Hui Wan’s serious expression and really couldn’t come up with any excuses.</p>
<p>However, he wasn’t good at teaching others. Despite racking his brains, he couldn’t think of anything that he could teach him.</p>
<p>Just as he was feeling stumped, he suddenly saw Li Xuan walk out of the manor. He had no idea why this fellow had come to the An family residence.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted as he coughed lightly and said to Hui Wan, “Verbal instruction can’t compare to actual practice. When you were at home, you should have learned a lot of theories. It’s time to do some combat training.”</p>
<p>“Master, you want to spar with me?” Hui Wan’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>“I taught you everything. I know you like the back of my hand. Sparring with me won’t have any effect,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Then what should we do?” Hui Wan said anxiously.</p>
<p>“See that person? He’s also your father’s junior. Based on the generation, you should call him Uncle-Master. Train with him first,” Zhou Wen said as he pointed at Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Is he very powerful?” Hui Wan sized up the sloppy Li Xuan and was very suspicious.</p>
<p>“Average I guess. He can only last three moves against me, but it’s enough as your sparring partner,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Master. I’ll work hard.” Hui Wan couldn’t muster up any energy when he heard that, but he couldn’t refute Zhou Wen. He only thought to himself, He can only last three moves against Master. He’s not that strong. I’ll think of a way to defeat him later and let Master see my improvement. He should personally spar with me then.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, whose child is this? What’s he doing?” Li Xuan walked over and asked.</p>
<p>“Hui Haifeng’s son. I was requested to teach him for fun. I happen to have something on. Help me teach him,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Old Hui’s son? Then I have to teach him well. Don’t worry. Leave him to me,” Li Xuan said as he patted his chest.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>“I’ll leave it to you then. I’ll get back to work.” Before Zhou Wen left, he exhorted Hui Wan, “Little Wan, learn well from your Uncle Li. It will be beneficial for you forever.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen returned to his room and eagerly took out the eleven Companion Eggs and used his phone to appraise their stats.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1323'>Chapter 1323: Lucky Dodge</h3>
<p>The two Mythical Companion Beasts were the Lucky Stone Sprite and the Lucky Clover King. Like the Baby Tiger, they had a Luck Life Providence, but they added more Luck than the Baby Tiger.</p>
<p>Stone Sprite +9 Luck, Lucky Clover King +7 Luck. The six Epic Companion Beasts added 3 to 6 Luck.</p>
<p>As for the two Legendary Companion Beasts, they were both +1 Luck.</p>
<p>The Lucky Stone Sprite’s Companion Form was a bracelet, the Lucky Clover King was a ring, and the Epic and Legendary Companion Beasts were myriad in nature. Zhou Wen did some calculations. Apart from two Companion Beasts that conflicted with the Companion Beasts he had to use, there was one that didn’t have a Companion Beast form. The rest could be used together.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised by the Mortal Companion Beast. This was because the Companion Beast didn’t have a Luck stat. As for why it was sent over as a Luck Companion Beast, Zhou Wen guessed that it had something to do with its skill.</p>
<p>It was obvious that a Mortal Companion Beast didn’t have a Life Providence, so it was naturally impossible for it to have a Luck Life Providence. After carefully reading the Companion Beast’s information, Zhou Wen realized that it wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>Death Harbinger Crow: Mortal stage.</p>
<p>Strength: 11</p>
<p>Speed: 11</p>
<p>Constitution: 11</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 11</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Necrology</p>
<p>Companion Form: Wings</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen carefully looked at its stats, he cursed his bad luck. He hurriedly looked at the list Hui Haifeng had given him. He didn’t remember seeing any crows on the list.</p>
<p>Indeed, the only Mortal Companion Beast on the list was Fortuitous Magpie, also known as the bird that delivered good news. It wasn’t the Death Harbinger Crow.</p>
<p>On careful comparison, Zhou Wen knew that Hui Haifeng must have made a mistake when he purchased it. The Death Harbinger Crow Companion Egg was very similar to the Fortuitous Magpie’s. Just by looking at its appearance, it was identical. He had probably mistaken the Death Harbinger for it.</p>
<p>As for whether the person who sold the Companion Egg to Hui Haifeng really didn’t know or was doing it on purpose, that wasn’t something Zhou Wen could know.</p>
<p>This Death Harbinger Crow is a little odd. It’s clearly a low-level Mortal Companion Beast and doesn’t have any Evolvable stat, but it actually has all its stats at 11. This is really rare. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and hatched the Death Harbinger Crow and the other Luck Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>Although being a harbinger of death was indeed annoying, Zhou Wen had always heard from the former principal that good medicine was bitter and the bitter truth hurts. It wasn’t a good thing to be a harbinger, but it was a pretty good ability that gave advance warning.</p>
<p>After the incubation was completed, Zhou Wen entered the game and put on all the lucky equipment he could wear.</p>
<p>Of course, the most important thing was the Heavenly Robe. It had a special Lucky Dodge ability. As long as the Luck stat worked, it could dodge attacks that were originally impossible to dodge.</p>
<p>However, the Heavenly Robe’s luck was limited, and its chance of dodging was very low. Zhou Wen had already tested it before. When facing the Golden Battle God’s bullets, there was only a 10% chance of dodging.</p>
<p>In the face of a Calamity-grade bullet, Zhou Wen hadn’t successfully dodged it once.</p>
<p>What Zhou Wen wanted to test was whether the other pieces of Luck equipment on him would affect Heavenly Robe’s ability to dodge.</p>
<p>After entering the dungeon, the Metal Guard’s bullets shot at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood there without moving. The Heavenly Robe on his body seemed to move without any wind, making him look like an immortal. The bullet strangely circled around Zhou Wen’s body and missed.</p>
<p>A large number of bullets shot over, but none of them hit Zhou Wen. All of them automatically deviated from their trajectories.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly delighted. Although the Heavenly Robe could easily dodge the Metal Guard’s bullets, it wasn’t that exaggerated. Previously, the Heavenly Robe would still yank Zhou Wen’s body aside to dodge the bullets.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen could stand there without moving. Just the fluttering of the Heavenly Robe allowed all the bullets to miss him. Clearly, Heavenly Robe’s dodging abilities had been enhanced.</p>
<p>I wonder how efficient Heavenly Robe’s dodging is when facing the Terror-grade Golden Battle God. Zhou Wen casually killed all the Metal Guards and waited for the Golden Battle God to appear.</p>
<p>Soon, the Golden Battle God Mark I rushed out. His freezing bullets were fired at a speed that the vision of ordinary humans couldn’t keep up with.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t move. He had come purely to experiment. Even if he was shot to death, he had no intention of moving.</p>
<p>The Heavenly Robe fluttered as the Terror-grade Frost Bullet brushed past his sleeve and struck the metal building’s wall, producing an ice fog.</p>
<p>It dodged the first shot. This effect is quite strong. I think there’s at least a 50% chance. Zhou Wen was even more delighted.</p>
<p>He didn’t attack and allowed the Golden Battle God to shoot at him. A scene that surprised and delighted Zhou Wen happened. No matter how crazy the Golden Battle God’s shots were, even if Zhou Wen stood still, none of the Golden Battle God’s bullets could hit him.</p>
<p>Amazing! Could it be that with the augmentation of all this lucky equipment, Heavenly Robe’s Lucky Dodge has reached 100%? Zhou Wen dodged more than a hundred bullets without being hit.</p>
<p>Without continuing the test, Zhou Wen killed the Golden Battle Gods one by one. He wanted to see if the Heavenly Robe could dodge the Calamity-grade bullets.</p>
<p>The alarm blared as Zhou Wen felt somewhat nervous. He failed to react in time when the gunshot rang.</p>
<p>However, the bullet didn’t hit Zhou Wen. The Heavenly Robe yanked Zhou Wen’s body a little and allowed him to fortuitously dodge the Calamity-grade bullet.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t… I really dodged it… I’ve hit the jackpot now… With this divine artifact on me… What’s there to be afraid of a Calamity-grade bullet... Zhou Wen had died too many times in the Venusian instance dungeon. He couldn’t help but be excited by this sudden discovery.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t dare make confirmation. He took another shot as an experiment, and he actually dodged it again.</p>
<p>Ah! This is really awesome. With the Heavenly Robe in hand, I have luck. Who else… Let me ask the world, who else can kill me? Zhou Wen felt as though he had eaten a Ginseng Fruit as he felt so comfortable.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>With a gunshot, Zhou Wen saw the blood-colored avatar’s head explode as the screen went black.</p>
<p>The smile on his face instantly turned into shock as his mouth remained agape.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me? I can be hit by the third shot? Zhou Wen calmed down and thought carefully. He could dodge the first two shots and the third shot was about the same strength as the first two shots. He felt that since the third shot wasn’t the sure-kill seventh, the reason he couldn’t dodge this shot was most likely because he didn’t have enough luck. When facing the Calamity-grade creature, his Lucky Dodge wasn’t 100% effective.</p>
<p>I have to get some more lucky equipment to give it a try. Perhaps I can really dodge the Calamity-grade bullets with 100% certainty. Zhou Wen thought about where he could get some more lucky equipment.</p>
<p>He had even used the Lady Luck Necklace that Jing Daoxian had given him to achieve such an effect. For a moment, he didn’t know where he could get lucky Companion Beasts.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1324'>Chapter 1324: Borrowing A Pet</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen checked a lot of information and realized that Luck Companion Beasts were indeed very rare. They were basically things that could only be chanced upon by luck. Ignoring Mythical Luck Beasts, even Epic Luck Beasts were rare.</p>
<p>After asking Gu Dian for information, the outcome wasn’t too good. Previously, there were two lucky pets on the black market. Due to the high price, no one was willing to buy them. They had been auctioned off a few days ago.</p>
<p>Gu Dian refused to say who had successfully bid for them due to his professional ethics.</p>
<p>However, even if he didn’t say it, Zhou Wen already knew that the two Companion Beasts were on him.</p>
<p>After doing a round of investigations, Zhou Wen knew that he definitely wouldn’t be able to find a lucky pet. Hui Haifeng had basically swept away all the lucky pets he could obtain. Ignoring the huge expenditure, it was very likely that he had used his connections and special items to trade. It was almost impossible for Zhou Wen to obtain a Luck Companion Beast from the market.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly thought of Wang Lu. Wang Lu had a Luck Life Providence to begin with, and she had quite a number of lucky pets. He wondered if any of them had yet to hatch.</p>
<p>“Do you have time? I have something to ask you.” Zhou Wen sent Wang Lu a message.</p>
<p>“So you only think of me when something’s up!” Soon, Wang Lu sent a message.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to explain, but on second thought, it did seem to be the case. Every time he took the initiative to send a message to Wang Lu, he seemed to require her help. He couldn’t help but blush and couldn’t bring himself to ask Wang Lu for help.</p>
<p>“Fine, I know you’re a busy person. If there’s anything, just say it. After all, you haven’t paid off the meals you owe. It won’t hurt to pile on more.” Wang Lu sent another message.</p>
<p>“I’ll treat you to a meal in a few days,” Zhou Wen replied in embarrassment.</p>
<p>“Then I have to rip you off good. I have to make you bleed.” Wang Lu asked again, “What’s the matter? Make it quick.”</p>
<p>“I just want to ask if you still have any Luck Companion Beasts. I want to buy a few,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I have lucky pets, but they aren’t for sale.” Wang Lu quickly sent a message back.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was only somewhat disappointed, but he didn’t fault Wang Lu. Luck Companion Beasts meant more to Wang Lu than ordinary people.</p>
<p>Ordinary people could only increase their luck by a little when they obtained a Luck Companion Beast, but they enhanced Wang Lu’s Life Providence. Its effects were much stronger than ordinary people. It could be said that a Luck Companion Beast was similar to Wang Lu’s exclusive Companion Beast.</p>
<p>I’m being too silly. Wang Lu doesn’t even have the time to collect Luck Companion Beasts. Why would she sell them? Zhou Wen felt that he was a little stupid for not thinking of this before. He shouldn’t have asked Wang Lu. This question put her in a difficult position.</p>
<p>“I’m just asking. It’s not of much use. I’ll look for you in a couple of days and treat you to a feast.” Zhou Wen sent a message.</p>
<p>“I’m definitely not selling it, but if you need it urgently, I can lend it to you for the time being. Why do you need a lucky pet?” Wang Lu sent another message.</p>
<p>“Can I borrow it?” Zhou Wen was delighted as he hurriedly said, “I want to use lucky pets to attempt the Venusian dimensional zone. Is it convenient to borrow it?”</p>
<p>Ordinary people wouldn’t be able to return the Companion Eggs after hatching them, but Zhou Wen had the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art, so it wasn’t difficult for him to return them.</p>
<p>“Alright, come to my place to get it. It’s not convenient for me to go out at the moment,” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>“Wait for me.” Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he immediately rushed to the Wang family home.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen left without a word. The officers Hui Haifeng had sent couldn’t help but grumble inwardly.</p>
<p>They had their doubts about whether Zhou Wen could lead them to the rankings. They only trusted Hui Haifeng, but that didn’t mean they trusted Zhou Wen completely.</p>
<p>At the very least, Zhou Wen’s present performance wasn’t reassuring.</p>
<p>They had been here for two days and had only seen Zhou Wen once on the first day. Then, they hadn’t seen him again. There was no training, no discussion for cooperation—not even a plan. They didn’t have any confidence in attempting the Venusian dimensional zone together. Anyone would feel uneasy. After all, this was a matter that risked their lives.</p>
<p>“Captain Wei, can we count on Zhou Wen?” an officer whispered to Wei Yang.</p>
<p>Wei Yang was the soldier with a stiff face. His facial features looked like they had been drawn on. He was the captain of this special ops team.</p>
<p>Without waiting for Wei Yang to reply, the officer continued, “The creatures that can enter the rankings are either Calamity-grade or large organizations like the Holy Spirit Association and the League of Guardians. The Holy Spirit Association has the augmentation of Fairy Peacock and True Martial, as well as an invincible existence like Ya. The League of Guardians has the guarantee of temporal and spatial powers. What do we have? Can Zhou Wen really lead us into the rankings by himself?”</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn’t just him. Many officers had such concerns. Zhou Wen was indeed famous, but there was still a certain gap between him and large organizations like the Holy Spirit Association and the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it seemed difficult for one person’s strength to beat any collective strength.</p>
<p>As soldiers, they could only obey orders, but to say that they weren’t nervous or afraid was a lie.</p>
<p>Wei Yang said expressionlessly, “Zhou Wen’s strength is undoubtedly top-notch among humans. From his past achievements, we can tell that this person isn’t simple. Furthermore, even the president holds him in such high esteem. I believe he’s definitely a person with true talent. We don’t need to worry about this. All we need to do is make preparations and help him get into the rankings.”</p>
<p>“How do we prepare? The president told us to listen to his orders, but we don’t even see him now,” the officer said gloomily.</p>
<p>Wei Yang’s expression remained unchanged as he said calmly, “The president has always been meticulous and comprehensive. If the president says that Zhou Wen can do it, he definitely can. Zhou Wen probably has his own plans for not meeting us now. All we need to do is stay sharp and unleash our greatest abilities when the time comes.”</p>
<p>Although the officers were somewhat uneasy, they didn’t let this uneasy feeling continue spreading due to Wei Yang’s influence. Instead, it weakened significantly. However, they were still displeased with Zhou Wen’s actions.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen rushed to the Wang family home that very night, but unfortunately, there were too many dimensional zones along the way. With his abilities, he couldn’t directly reach the Wang family. All he could do was constantly use instant transmission to travel and circle around some dimensional zones that had yet to be explored by humans.</p>
<p>Thankfully, nothing happened along the way. In less than two days, Zhou Wen reached the Wang family home.</p>
<p>Wang Lu curled her lips when she saw Zhou Wen. “If you weren’t borrowing a Companion Beast, would you have ever taken the initiative to repay the debt?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1325'>Chapter 1325: Transfer</h3>
<p>“As the saying goes, there’s no disadvantage to having too much debt. I’ll owe you more so that I can repay you later in one shot,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Wang Lu burst out laughing as she rolled her eyes at Zhou Wen. “Which planet did you get that saying from?”</p>
<p>“Of course it’s from Earth,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“On Earth, there’s no disadvantage to having too many skills. I’ve never heard of the phrase that there’s no disadvantage to having too much debt,” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>“Is that so?” Zhou Wen asked, feigning ignorance.</p>
<p>“Alright, stop pretending. Since you’re here today, you have to pay some interest,” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>“Alright, tell me where you want to eat. I still have enough money to buy you a bowl of seafood noodles—the kind that doesn’t have seafood.” After not seeing her for a long time, Zhou Wen didn’t feel unfamiliar with her at all. Wang Lu was still the same Wang Lu as though he had met her not long ago.</p>
<p>“At the very least, you are now Luoyang’s number three figure. Can you not be so stingy?” Wang Lu said angrily.</p>
<p>“What number three figure?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>“Apart from Leng Zongzheng and An Tianzuo, Luoyang is counting you. If you aren’t number three, what are you?” Wang Lu paused before continuing, “Don’t just stand outside. Go in. Tell me, how do you plan on clearing the Venusian dimensional zone?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed Wang Lu into the Wang family residence and realized that it was a back door. There was a garden inside, but he didn’t see anyone.</p>
<p>As Wang Lu led the way, Zhou Wen roughly explained how Hui Haifeng had entrusted him with the mission of entering the rankings and his plans.</p>
<p>“I’ve never heard of using luck to dodge attacks. Are you confident? Against a Calamity-grade creature, if your dodging fails, you will die,” Wang Lu said worriedly.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. It’s not like you don’t know me well. I have other backup plans. Even if I can’t dodge it, I won’t end up being killed. I’ll definitely return alive,” Zhou Wen said confidently.</p>
<p>“It’s good that you have a plan.” Wang Lu sized up Zhou Wen and suddenly said, “Give me your hand.”</p>
<p>“What for?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement as he extended his hand in front of Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you want to borrow a Companion Beast?” Wang Lu said as she pressed her hand on Zhou Wen’s right palm, her palm facing his.</p>
<p>A dazzling light flashed between their palms.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Zhou Wen felt waves of energy enter his palm and was alarmed.</p>
<p>He wasn’t surprised because he was afraid, but because he was worried about Wang Lu.</p>
<p>He originally wanted to borrow Wang Lu’s Companion Eggs and return them to her after using them.</p>
<p>However, he never expected Wang Lu to transfer a contracted Companion Beast to him.</p>
<p>With him possessing the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art, it wasn’t a problem to transfer a Companion Beast, but Wang Lu didn’t know the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art. God knew what price she had to pay to transfer a Companion Beast to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>If an ordinary person transferred a Companion Beast, they would at least lose half their life. If they were unlucky, they might even die.</p>
<p>Although he knew that Wang Lu likely had some special means, there was typically a price to pay. Techniques like the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art were just too rare.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you want me to lend you my pet?” Wang Lu said with a smile, but her actions didn’t stop. The light from her palm intensified as it constantly transformed into a stream of light that stabbed into Zhou Wen’s palm.</p>
<p>“If I had known this would happen, I wouldn’t have come,” Zhou Wen said with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>Now that things were midway, Zhou Wen couldn’t stop it abruptly. If he forcefully stopped it, not only would he injure Wang Lu, the Companion Beast that was being transferred midway would probably be lost.</p>
<p>“It’s just transferring a Companion Beast. It’s not difficult for me. However, I definitely take note of this debt. You have to repay it in the future,” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head and didn’t say a word as he waited for the Companion Beast’s transfer to be completed.</p>
<p>The transfer of Companion Beasts seemed to take a long time. The transfer didn’t complete despite half an hour passing.</p>
<p>What Companion Beast is this? Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. However, the energy that had been transmitted wasn’t as simple as the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>“Of course it’s a lucky Companion Beast. Would I give you an unlucky Companion Beast?” Wang Lu curled her lips.</p>
<p>“Terror grade?” Zhou Wen stared at Wang Lu and asked.</p>
<p>“That’s right. I won’t be able to produce any inferior Companion Beasts,” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown. The higher the level of a Companion Beast, the more difficult it was to transfer it. The price to transfer a Terror-grade Companion Beast was definitely not trivial.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt deep regret. He couldn’t bear the responsibility if anything dire happened to Wang Lu.</p>
<p>About an hour later, the light in Wang Lu’s palm gradually converged until it vanished, revealing an additional star pattern in the middle of Zhou Wen’s palm.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?” Zhou Wen didn’t look at the Companion Beast as he kept sizing Wang Lu up.</p>
<p>“What can happen to me? Are you hoping that I’ll vomit blood and faint? Then, you can take the opportunity to save the damsel in distress and obtain both me and my wealth, so there’s no need to pay the debt of the Companion Beast and all the past debts?” Wang Lu smiled and said, “Stop dreaming. I won’t accept anything less.”</p>
<p>Seeing that Wang Lu was indeed fine, Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief. “Don’t worry. I don’t dare say that I’ll return you double, but I’ll definitely return what I owe.”</p>
<p>“Alright, stop wasting time. Make your preparations. You mustn’t be careless and must have complete confidence. If you feel that something is amiss, don’t force yourself,” Wang Lu exhorted.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll head back now. I’ll touch base with you again after I’m done.” Zhou Wen stood up and prepared to leave.</p>
<p>Wang Lu walked Zhou Wen to the door and waved goodbye. Only when he disappeared from her sight did she turn around and return.</p>
<p>After closing the back door, Wang Lu leaned against it and suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood. Her face turned pale as though she had been enervated. She slowly leaned against the door and sat down, as though she didn’t even have the strength to stand up.</p>
<p>The light and shadows in the garden changed as a dream-like figure walked out of the void. Her figure was holy and charming, like a combination of a devil and an angel. She slowly came in front of Wang Lu—she was actually a Guardian like a goddess from Greek mythology.</p>
<p>“You’re a very strange person. I’ve seen many humans. They yearn to tell the entire world the modicum they’ve done. You paid such a huge price to transfer him the Lucky Star that is of great importance to you. Not only did you suffer serious injuries, you even insisted on sending him out, causing your injuries to aggravate. Do you have masochistic tendencies?” The Guardian used her finger to lift up Wang Lu’s chin and whispered into her ear with her seductive red lips.</p>
<p>Wang Lu turned her head forcefully and shook off the Guardian’s finger. She said calmly, “I don’t need gratitude or pity. I naturally don’t need him to know of such meaningless things.”</p>
<p>“Then what do you need? That man? As long as you are willing to contract with me and have our powers combined, a glance from you will be enough to make all men prostrate before you, much less him.” The Guardian’s eyes shimmered, but her body emitted a holy glow. She reached out to touch Wang Lu’s forehead.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1326'>Chapter 1326: Loss of Luck</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Wang Lu reached out and swatted away the Guardian’s hand. She said calmly, “I said that I won’t contract with you. Not in the past, not now, and not in the future.”</p>
<p>The Guardian didn’t flare up. She retracted her hand and said with a smile, “Don’t forget that you’re not an ordinary person. It’s very difficult for others to injure you, but once you’re injured, it’s very difficult for you to recover. No external force can treat you. You can only rely on your own body to slowly recover.”</p>
<p>“It will eventually recover,” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Although your injuries are very serious, they still won’t take your life. Given time, you’ll eventually recover.” The Guardian’s eyes gradually narrowed. “However, you’ve probably never been injured before. You don’t know much about what will happen after you’re injured. Then let me tell you. After you’re injured, your luck will decrease. With your current injuries, your luck might have already reached a nadir.”</p>
<p>“Do you want to take the opportunity to kill me? Then do it,” Wang Lu said nonchalantly.</p>
<p>“Baby, how can I bear to kill you? If I kill you, where can I find another human like you to contract with? There probably isn’t a second human in this world who is more suitable to contract with me than you.” The Guardian’s expression gradually turned cold. “But without your luck to suppress your sister’s power of misfortune, she will produce the expected effects. With me aiding her, I’m afraid the Wang family will only have the two of you left remaining. Wouldn’t that be fun?”</p>
<p>Wang Lu’s expression changed. She didn’t know that her luck would greatly weaken after she was injured because this was unprecedented.</p>
<p>If the Guardian strengthened Wang Chan’s power of misfortune as she claimed, the Wang family might really suffer a calamity.</p>
<p>“Do you think I’ll believe you?” Wang Lu forced herself to calm down.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Guardian was just bluffing. There was no such thing as having her luck drop because of an injury.</p>
<p>“You don’t believe me?” The Guardian flicked a coin into Wang Lu’s hand and said, “Try flipping it ten times. Under normal circumstances, you should be able to get tails ten times in a row, right? Let me see how many times you can get tails. Five or six times? With your injuries, six times should be your limit, I suppose?”</p>
<p>Wang Lu caught the coin and took a look. Then, she flipped it into the air. When she caught it, she realized that it wasn’t heads, but the number “1”.</p>
<p>“Heh heh, looks like your luck is much lower than I thought.” The Guardian smiled.</p>
<p>Wang Lu’s expression changed as she flipped the coin again. She wanted to get tails, but when the coin landed, it was still 1.</p>
<p>Wang Lu flipped the coin a few times, but she didn’t get a single tails. All she got was 1.</p>
<p>The Guardian sighed and said, “Even I miscalculated. I didn’t expect your sister’s power of misfortune to be so strong. Now that your luck has weakened, her power of misfortune is sufficient to suppress your luck because of her existence. Perhaps Wang Chan’s power can completely bury your Wang family even without my help.”</p>
<p>Wang Lu’s expression was extremely ugly. She knew that the Guardian was right. Wang Chan’s power of misfortune had escalated so quickly that it exceeded everyone’s expectations.</p>
<p>When her luck was still present, she couldn’t sense it. Now that her luck had greatly weakened, Wang Chan’s power of misfortune appeared.</p>
<p>“You have no other choice. Sign a contract with me and, using my power, restore your body. You can suppress Wang Chan’s power of misfortune and return everything to normal. Otherwise, even if Wang Chan’s power isn’t enough to destroy the Wang family, I will help her…” The Guardian was like the devil. Her words were as tempting as the abyss.</p>
<p>Wang Lu’s expression was colored by different emotions. She was momentarily unable to make a decision.</p>
<p>Suddenly, shouts came from the Wang family’s courtyard. It seemed like there was a fire somewhere. The fire was very strong, and soon, thick smoke could be seen rising into the sky from the garden.</p>
<p>“What a potent power of misfortune. It took effect so quickly.” The Guardian looked at Wang Lu and continued, “Actually, I’ve never understood why you aren’t willing to contract with me.”</p>
<p>“The Guardian contract is an equal contract. I won’t affect your body or hinder your life. However, with my strength, you can do many things that you couldn’t do in the past. The contract is only beneficial to you…”</p>
<p>Wang Lu bit her lip and didn’t answer. However, when she heard the various shouts coming from the Wang family’s yard, her eyes gradually lost their firmness.</p>
<p>The Guardian struck while the iron was hot and continued, “Now, if you humans want to become true powerhouses, there aren’t more than three paths. Use the Mythical Serum or fuse with a Guardian. The two are actually similar. They will make you half-human. If you want to keep your human body, contracting with me is undoubtedly the best choice.”</p>
<p>“No, there’s another way,” said Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“Oh, what path?” the Guardian asked.</p>
<p>“Advance to the Mythical stage as a human,” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>The Guardian laughed. “What a joke. You humans have innately flawed bodies. It’s impossible for you to advance to the Mythical stage. Advancing to the Mythical stage as a human only exists in the imagination of humans. You don’t really think that’s possible, do you?”</p>
<p>“It’s not an imagination on my part, but I’m sure it can be done. This is because humans have already advanced to the Mythical stage through their own abilities,” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>“Are you talking about Human Sovereign? It’s unknown if Human Sovereign is a pure human, but I’m guessing that he definitely isn’t. At most, he’s half-human, half-Guardian like Ya.” As the Guardian walked towards Wang Lu, she said with a smile, “Instead of having unrealistic dreams, why don’t you spend some time thinking about how to resolve the problem in front of you? I’m your only choice.”</p>
<p>“I…” Wang Lu wanted to say something, but she was interrupted by a voice.</p>
<p>“I think it’s good to dream. What if it comes true?” A figure appeared out of thin air in front of Wang Lu, blocking the Guardian who was about to reach her.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen… Why are you…” Although she could only see his back, Wang Lu still recognized him at a glance.</p>
<p>“I naturally have to settle the trouble I caused.” In the past, Zhou Wen might have been fooled by Wang Lu, but as Truth Listener’s strength increased, Wang Lu’s bluff in front of him had been betrayed by her strong inner voice.</p>
<p>It was only because Zhou Wen had heard her thoughts and knew that her injuries couldn’t be treated by external forces that he didn’t immediately treat Wang Lu. He never expected such a thing to happen.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid you can’t handle the trouble here..” The Guardian looked at Zhou Wen and curled her lips. “You probably don’t know who I am, right?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1327'>Chapter 1327: Outbreak of Misfortune</h3>
<p>“Who are you? Is that important? In my opinion, it doesn’t matter who you are,” Zhou Wen said calmly.</p>
<p>“The ignorant are fearless. Do you think I’m one of those trash Guardians sent over from the dimension? I’m a Guardian who survived the Mythical era. Even if you can use the Mythical Serum to advance to the Terror grade, in my opinion, you’re just a baby holding a big knife,” the Guardian said as she stared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Are you done? If you’re done, prepare to die,” Zhou Wen said as he summoned the Dragon King armor and Asura Saber.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew a lot about Guardians. A truly powerful Guardian, even a Guardian who had survived the Mythical era, would still be suppressed by Earth’s laws.</p>
<p>Was Drought Demon Fairy impressive? All she could do was be trapped in the Fiend Tomb. Without a human contract, she was suppressed to the point of being unable to leave the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>No matter how powerful this Guardian was in the past, the fact that she could stand here without a contract and not be suppressed meant that she couldn’t be at the Calamity grade. At best, she was at the Terror grade.</p>
<p>“You are Deceit King?” Upon seeing the Dragon King armor and Asura Saber, the Guardian immediately recognized Zhou Wen and her expression changed uncontrollably.</p>
<p>The name ‘Deceit King’ was known by all on Earth now. Even the Guardians knew this name.</p>
<p>The Dragon King Armor and Asura Saber were like the Prisoned Dragon Armor and the Immortal Culling Sword of Human Sovereign. They were easily recognized.</p>
<p>Of course, the Son of Heaven’s Sword was also easily recognized, but Zhou Wen usually didn’t use it because it lacked offensive power.</p>
<p>Deceit King had consecutively defeated Ya and Immortal—both top Terror-grade Guardians. Although this Guardian believed that she wasn’t inferior to them, she didn’t dare say that victory was a cinch.</p>
<p>However, this wasn’t the only thing that alarmed the Guardian. This was because Zhou Wen was clearly a pure human. He had easily broken through to the Terror grade without any external help.</p>
<p>Only then did the Guardian realize that the person Wang Lu had mentioned wasn’t Human Sovereign. It was likely Zhou Wen who was right in front of her.</p>
<p>Can pure humans really advance to the Mythical stage by themselves? That’s impossible. He must have used some external force. It’s just that I can’t tell. Perhaps it’s a Mythical Serum that doesn’t have obvious characteristics of dimensional creatures, the Guardian thought.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wish to speak to her as he slashed with the Asura Saber.</p>
<p>The Guardian’s figure blinked, and many illusions appeared. In an instant, her figure was everywhere in the courtyard. It was impossible to tell which was real and which was fake.</p>
<p>The phantoms from all directions attacked Zhou Wen. They had terrifying auras and powerful Essence Energy fluctuations. It was impossible to tell which attack was real and which attack was fake.</p>
<p>It was naturally impossible for a single person to simultaneously defend against all attacks.</p>
<p>“I have the power of all things. You can’t even tell which one is my real body, so how can you fight me?” The phantoms spoke at the same time—even their voices were the same.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression didn’t change as he ignored all the attacks. The Asura Saber slashed at an empty spot. With a domineering stance, Transcendent Flying Immortal instantly split a fake mountain in half.</p>
<p>The attacks that filled the sky landed on Zhou Wen, but they turned into bubbles and failed to injure him at all.</p>
<p>Behind the rockery, the Guardian’s eyes widened in disbelief as she retreated uncontrollably. In the middle of her forehead, a bloody gash was slowly spreading.</p>
<p>She had only taken a few steps back when her leg hit a rock. Her body immediately split into two and she fell to the ground, her blood staining the grass beside her.</p>
<p>Amongst Mythical creatures, even the transformation technique of the Six-Eared Macaque of the Four Dimitrios Monkeys couldn’t fool Truth Listener, let alone the Guardian.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen retracted the Asura Saber and Dragon King armor. Without looking at the corpse, he came in front of Wang Lu and asked, “Is there really no other way to treat your injuries?”</p>
<p>Wang Lu shook her head. “No. The power of luck makes it very difficult for me to be injured, but once I’m injured, I can only recover on my own. I can’t undergo treatment. I’ve tried using pill essences and healing powers before, but it was useless.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Zhou Wen said with a sigh. If not for her lending him the Companion Beast, Wang Lu wouldn’t have been injured.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you help me now? We’re even.” Wang Lu turned to look at the Wang family’s smoking area and said anxiously, “Now’s not the time to talk about this. I have to think of a way to resolve Little Chan’s bad luck…”</p>
<p>“Leave this to me. I’ll take Wang Chan away for a period of time. When you recover, I’ll send her back,” Zhou Wen said as he flashed away.</p>
<p>“How can you…” Wang Lu wanted to stop him, but Zhou Wen was already gone.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After five years, Wang Chan had grown into a slender and elegant girl.</p>
<p>At that moment, Wang Chan was in a panic. She could sense that the power of misfortune in her body was producing the effects. The commotion in the Wang family was closely related to her power of misfortune.</p>
<p>“Wang Chan, do you still recognize me?” Zhou Wen instant transmitted in front of Wang Chan and called out softly.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen!” Wang Chan was first delighted when she saw Zhou Wen. She wanted to walk over, but she immediately retreated and said anxiously, “Don’t come over. Leave quickly. Don’t approach me. It’s dangerous.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be afraid. I know something is wrong with you. Your sister asked me to come over to resolve the problem with you. Come with me.” Zhou Wen extended his hand in front of Wang Chan.</p>
<p>Wang Chan only hesitated for a moment before giving her hand to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held Wang Chan’s hand and used Singularity Universe’s interstellar teleportation ability to arrive on the moon.</p>
<p>“Stand beside me. Don’t be too far away.” Zhou Wen used Human Sovereign’s power. The powerful life force emitted by Human Sovereign’s power allowed Wang Chan to survive on the moon despite the lack of oxygen.</p>
<p>“Is this the Moon?” Wang Chan looked around curiously. This place was different from what she had imagined.</p>
<p>“Yes, follow me.” Zhou Wen led Wang Chan towards Lady Supreme Yin’s temple.</p>
<p>Wang Chan’s power of misfortune was too strong. It wasn’t appropriate for Zhou Wen to take her anywhere, so he could only come up to the moon first, hoping that Lady Supreme Yin could take Wang Chan in for a while.</p>
<p>As long as Wang Lu’s injuries recovered and her luck powers were activated again, Wang Chan could return.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t manage to walk far before he suddenly tripped himself and fell to the ground with a plop.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Wen didn’t know how he failed to respond to that momentary confusion.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, are you alright?” Wang Chan hurriedly came over to help Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I’m fine…” Just as Zhou Wen said that he was fine, Wang Chan slammed into his face because she wasn’t used to the Moon’s different gravitational strength.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1328'>Chapter 1328: Invincible Lucky Star</h3>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen’s physique was sufficiently strong, so his face was fine. Otherwise, if he was hit on the nose, he would probably tear up from the pain. He might even have a nosebleed.</p>
<p>“Sorry… Sorry…” Wang Chan apologized profusely, not daring to approach Zhou Wen again as she tried her best to maintain her distance.</p>
<p>“I’m fine.” Zhou Wen silently summoned his Luck Companion Beasts and wore them. He thought to himself, Luck and Misfortune are really very special abilities. Wang Chan’s level clearly isn’t high, but she can produce such a huge impact. Even I’m affected by her. Perhaps luck can really help me dodge the fatal seventh shot.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen thought of the Companion Beast that Wang Lu had transferred to him. Previously, he hadn’t had the mood to take a look because of Wang Lu, so he wasn’t sure what Companion Beast it was.</p>
<p>Invincible Lucky Star: Terror-grade (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Lucky Star</p>
<p>Life Soul: Super Lucky Star</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Invincible Lucky Star</p>
<p>Terror Form: Luck Descent</p>
<p>Strength: 99</p>
<p>Speed: 99</p>
<p>Constitution: 99</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 99</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Great Wheel of Fortune, Lucky Time, Lucky Hand.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Soul</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was stunned seeing the stats. They were just too terrifying. It wasn’t that Zhou Wen didn’t have top-notch Terror Companion Beasts that could evolve, but he really didn’t have one that added luck.</p>
<p>The key was that ordinary lucky pets—in other words, their Life Providence—added luck. This thing actually added luck to every ability. It was simply an excellent-grade Companion Beast with the luck attribute.</p>
<p>Just its Life Providence added 36 points of luck. With the augmentation of the Life Soul, Wheel of Destiny, and Terror transformation, Zhou Wen estimated that his luck would exceed 100.</p>
<p>Even if it did not exceed 100, it must have reached the limit of his luck value.</p>
<p>This isn’t right. Wang Lu didn’t even contract a Guardian and hasn’t advanced to the Mythical stage. How did she obtain this Terror-grade Companion Beast? Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>However, with a Companion Beast like Invincible Lucky Star—which could almost be considered a divine artifact—if he couldn’t dodge the Calamity-grade bullets, he could basically give up on the strategy.</p>
<p>Unless there was an even more overpowered dodging skill than Heavenly Robe, it was impossible to dodge the bullets.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at his phone as he walked. Wang Chan carefully followed behind him, not daring to get too close, afraid that her power of misfortune would affect him.</p>
<p>Croak! A huge toad suddenly appeared, startling Wang Chan. She took a few steps back, stepped on Zhou Wen’s foot, and bumped into him.</p>
<p>“Sorry… Sorry…” Wang Chan apologized profusely.</p>
<p>“Don’t apologize to me in the future, understand? With my relationship with your sister, there’s no need for you to apologize to me.” Zhou Wen felt pity for Wang Chan when he saw her like this.</p>
<p>Living under such pressure all the time, one would either explode in despair and become an extremely evil person who didn’t care about anything, or one would always have to bear the pressure and suffer mental problems.</p>
<p>Over the years, it was already quite good that Wang Chan had remained unchanged.</p>
<p>When Wang Chan heard Zhou Wen’s words, she widened her eyes and asked in surprise, “Could it be… you’re going to be my brother-in-law?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nearly choked on his saliva. He took a deep breath and said, “I mean, I have a good relationship with your sister. She has helped me a lot. You don’t have to be polite with me.”</p>
<p>With that said, Zhou Wen was just about to greet Chang’e when she flicked out her tongue and swept Zhou Wen and Wang Chan over. She placed them on her back and headed for Lady Supreme Yin’s temple.</p>
<p>In next to no time, the two of them arrived before Lady Supreme Yin’s temple.</p>
<p>“Lady Goddess, I’m here to visit you.” Zhou Wen got off the toad’s back and shouted into the temple.</p>
<p>“You call this visiting me? It’s more like you want my life!” Lady Supreme Yin’s angry voice came from inside.</p>
<p>“Lady Goddess, what do you mean?” Zhou Wen feigned ignorance.</p>
<p>Lady Supreme Yin said coldly, “You brought a natural Body of Bane to my Moon. Do you think that I’m living too comfortably on the Moon and want the Moon to explode right now?”</p>
<p>“Lady Goddess, don’t say that. She’s just a little girl. She’s not as powerful as you make her out to be. You are very resourceful. This little trouble of hers can easily be resolved by you,” Zhou Wen flattered, but his boot-licking skills were clearly lacking.</p>
<p>Lady Supreme Yin laughed and said, “It’s hard on you. From the sound of it, you haven’t flattered anyone before. This flattery is too fake. However, since you have said so, let her stay.”</p>
<p>“You are agreeable to it?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He never expected Lady Supreme Yin to be so affable.</p>
<p>“Why? You plan on taking her away?” Lady Supreme Yin said with a faint smile.</p>
<p>“I don’t mean that. I just think that her physique is a little special. Will she cause you trouble if she stays here? In fact, I have a golden apple that can change her Life Providence, so I was thinking of using your place to change it for her?” Zhou Wen said as he took out the golden apple.</p>
<p>He had yet to use it. Wang Chan’s Life Providence wasn’t very good. Even if he resolved the current situation, the same thing would happen again if Wang Lu was injured again.</p>
<p>“Change her Life Providence? Has your head been kicked by a donkey? Or did your head get clipped by a door when you were young? You want to change a natural Body of Bane that’s impossibly rare?” Lady Supreme Yin said angrily.</p>
<p>“Although this thing is very rare, it only has disadvantages and no benefits. What’s the point of keeping it?” Zhou Wen deliberately said so when he heard Lady Supreme Yin mention how Wang Chan’s Body of Bane wasn’t simple.</p>
<p>Lady Supreme Yin said, “You are really ignorant. Don’t you know that extreme Yang gives birth to Yin and extreme Yin gives birth to Yang? A Body of Bane does not seem to have any benefits, but haven’t you ever wondered why as the owner of a Body of Bane, she has never been affected? Is this normal?”</p>
<p>“I’m just an ignorant mortal. Please enlighten me.” Zhou Wen was secretly delighted. He never expected to accidentally find someone who knew the ropes.</p>
<p>If he could resolve Wang Chan’s problem, he could provide an explanation when meeting Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“You’ve finally said something pleasant.” Lady Supreme Yin pushed open the door and walked out. She sized up Wang Chan and said, “In the division of dimensional creatures, there are no Mortal, Legendary, or Epic stages. There’s only the Mythical stage. However, Mythical creatures are also divided into three levels. Terror, Calamity, and Apocalypse. These are the three levels of Mythical creatures. Your so-called Mythical creatures are only the nascent form of Mythical creatures.”</p>
<p>“I know all of that,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Since you know everything, why don’t you do the talking.” Lady Supreme Yin rolled her eyes at him.</p>
<p>“Please continue. I’ll shut up.” Zhou Wen shut his mouth.</p>
<p>“But regardless of whether it’s Terror, Calamity, or Apocalypse, do you know the source of these?” Lady Supreme Yin didn’t want Zhou Wen to speak, but she still raised a question for him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen closed his mouth and shook his head.</p>
<p>“That is a bane. Only when humans encounter a bane will they be filled with terror. Only then will they realize how terrifying a calamity is. Only then will they fear the arrival of the apocalypse. In essence, a bane is actually the source of myths. Now, do you understand how precious the attribute of bane is?” said Lady Supreme Yin.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1329'>Chapter 1329: Invincible Dodge</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>This was also the first time Wang Chan had heard someone say that her Body of Bane was good. This was unprecedented. She widened her eyes as she looked at Lady Supreme Yin with an expression filled with anticipation and fear of disappointment.</p>
<p>“Lady Goddess, according to what you said, wouldn’t Wang Chan, who has the Body of Bane, be very powerful? Then can she use the Body of Bane to advance to the Calamity or Apocalypse level in the future?” Zhou Wen asked on Wang Chan’s behalf.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Lady Supreme Yin rolled her eyes at him and said, “Are you dreaming? I only said that the attribute of Bane is very precious, but I didn’t say that one would definitely be very strong if they had a Bane physique. Not to mention the Calamity-grade, you humans can’t even reach the Mythical…”</p>
<p>Halfway through her sentence, Lady Supreme Yin glanced at Zhou Wen and suddenly paused. Then, she continued, “Generally speaking, it’s unlikely for humans to advance to the Mythical stage unless they obtain external help.”</p>
<p>“Let’s put it this way. The attributes of Bane, Hope, Luck, and Lust are very precious and special. With these attributes, one will naturally be much stronger than ordinary people and have greater potential. However, how far one can go depends on one’s cultivation,” explained Lady Supreme Yin.</p>
<p>Wang Chan revealed a look of disappointment when she heard that.</p>
<p>Since it was difficult to advance to the Mythical stage like the average person, and the power of the Bane Body would become stronger and stronger, resulting in an increasing effect on the people around her, it was useless no matter how strong this attribute of hers was.</p>
<p>“Lady Goddess, although the Bane attribute is very strong, it has a very bad influence on the people around you. Is there any way to resolve this?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“It’s impossible to completely eliminate the effects. However, it’s not difficult to control them slightly and not cause too much trouble,” said Lady Supreme Yin confidently.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Wang Chan were overjoyed. Wang Chan knelt down and kowtowed to Lady Supreme Yin, but before she could do so, she was lifted up by an invisible force.</p>
<p>“Don’t kowtow me. I still want to live a few more years.” Lady Supreme Yin turned to Zhou Wen and said, “Take your golden apple and get lost as far as you can. Leave this young lady to me.”</p>
<p>“Wang Chan, are you willing to stay?” Zhou Wen first sought Wang Chan’s opinion.</p>
<p>“I want to stay.” Wang Chan was very opinionated.</p>
<p>Since Wang Chan was willing to stay, Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else. He stayed on the Moon for another day. Firstly, he wanted to see how Lady Supreme Yin planned on modifying Wang Chan. Secondly, he wanted to see if the Invincible Lucky Star was useful.</p>
<p>Entering the game again, Zhou Wen summoned all the Luck Companion Beasts, including the Invincible Lucky Star. He wore whatever he could wear and had whatever he couldn’t wear by his side to boost his courage.</p>
<p>Once again, he saw the Metal Guards and the Golden Battle Gods. Just like before, Zhou Wen didn’t move at all. His Heavenly Robe danced as he dodged all the bullets.</p>
<p>However, the real test had only just begun. When the Calamity-grade gunshot sounded, Zhou Wen’s heart nearly jumped out of his chest.</p>
<p>I dodged it… Zhou Wen saw the Heavenly Robe move by itself. It yanked the blood-colored avatar’s body to the side, dodging the Calamity-grade bullet.</p>
<p>However, this did not prove anything. He had previously dodged the first two shots and was still killed in the end.</p>
<p>Shot after shot—all six consecutive shots missed. None of them hit the blood-colored avatar’s body.</p>
<p>The crucial seventh shot is finally here… Can I dodge it? Zhou Wen was extremely nervous.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The gunshot sounded again. Zhou Wen had already used all his means, but he couldn’t see the trajectory of the seventh shot.</p>
<p>However, after the gunshot, Zhou Wen saw a white halo appear around the blood-colored avatar. It was as though the blood-colored avatar was wearing a large hula hoop. It floated around the blood-colored avatar’s chest, but it failed to injure it at all.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a careful look and was immediately alarmed. It wasn’t a halo at all, but the seventh bullet. It spun around the blood-colored avatar at the speed of light, but it couldn’t touch its body.</p>
<p>This is the power of the Heavenly Robe augmented by the Invincible Lucky Star? Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>The seventh bullet refused to give up unless someone was killed. It kept flying at the speed of light, trying to approach the blood-colored avatar’s body.</p>
<p>However, every time the bullet tried to approach the blood-colored avatar, the Heavenly Robe would use its powers to yank Zhou Wen’s body to the side. Since the bullet couldn’t hit him, it could only chase after the blood-colored avatar. Therefore, it looked like a halo.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>The Calamity-grade gunshots sounded again, but they still failed to touch Zhou Wen. The bullets were dodged by the Heavenly Robe.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t leave as he stood there experimenting. He wanted to know how many times he could dodge the shots with the help of Invincible Lucky Star and other lucky equipment. He wanted to know how likely it was to achieve such an effect.</p>
<p>The outcome made Zhou Wen even happier. After a second round of the seventh bullet, the Calamity-grade bullets still failed to hit the blood-colored avatar protected by the Heavenly Robe. The second round’s seventh sure-kill bullet was also like the first round’s sure-kill bullet. It constantly circled the blood-colored avatar’s body, but it failed to injure the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen experimented again and again, but the results left him pleasantly surprised. He dodged the set of six bullets in a row. Up to now, not a single one of them could injure the blood-colored avatar. Instead, the blood-colored avatar seemed to have six additional halos around it.</p>
<p>This left Zhou Wen somewhat depressed. The sure-kill bullets had been circling him, wanting his life. A single mistake could result in an irreversible outcome. This was a burdensome worry. No one knew if the bullets would penetrate the blood-colored avatar’s body the very next second.</p>
<p>With such a powerful dodging ability, it was not difficult to reach the Golden Palace. Even an ordinary person could complete the task.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was no such thing as a reward for reaching the Golden Palace in-game. It was useless even if Zhou Wen arrived there.</p>
<p>Seeing that he had nothing special to do with Wang Chan on the Moon and that there was no danger, Zhou Wen got up and returned to Earth.</p>
<p>Now, he was completely confident that he could lead Hui Haifeng’s men to enter the rankings, so there was no need to delay any longer.</p>
<p>After returning to Earth, Zhou Wen first sent Wang Lu a message, telling her not to worry about Wang Chan. He also explained the general situation.</p>
<p>Upon hearing that Wang Chan was fine and might even be able to stop the power of calamity, Wang Lu was also very happy. She even exhorted Zhou Wen to be careful. She was fine on her side and Zhou Wen didn’t need to worry.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen heave a sigh of relief, but he was thinking about something else.</p>
<p>I’m finally going to put an end to this! Zhou Wen wasn’t very lucky for some reason.. After traveling for nearly 72 hours, he returned to Luoyang.</p>
<p>2</p>
<h3 id='chapter1330'>Chapter 1330: Federation Suicide Squad</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Wei Yang and the other officers were a little anxious. They had been ordered to help Zhou Wen ascend the rankings, but ever since they arrived, they had only seen Zhou Wen once. It was no wonder they had such thoughts.</p>
<p>When they knew that Zhou Wen had returned, the officers immediately came to see him.</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou, when are we leaving for Venus?” Wei Yang was the calmest among the officers, but he was the commander and had an obligation to speak on behalf of all the officers. His question was mostly asked on the behalf of those officers.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow.” Zhou Wen naturally hoped that it would be as soon as possible. After completing this matter, he had other things to do.</p>
<p>With more and more powerful creatures appearing, he had to think of a way to quickly allow Slaughterer to undergo a Terror transformation. He felt uneasy if he didn’t advance to the Terror grade.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow?” The officers were stunned.</p>
<p>Although they hoped that Zhou Wen could complete the mission as soon as possible, they didn’t have much time to research and practice if it was happening tomorrow.</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou, isn’t tomorrow too rushed?” Wei Yang frowned.</p>
<p>“Not at all. Get ready. We’ll set off at seven tomorrow morning. It won’t affect breakfast.” Zhou Wen planned on eating breakfast after returning.</p>
<p>Wei Yang and company misunderstood him, thinking that Zhou Wen was referring to them getting up early to have breakfast before going.</p>
<p>Wei Yang and company looked at Zhou Wen and asked, “Mr. Zhou, how are we going to practice tonight?”</p>
<p>“Practice? What practice?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he asked Wei Yang in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“We’re going to Venus tomorrow morning. Don’t we need to make sure we can cooperate well?” Wei Yang’s expressionless face revealed a rare trace of doubt.</p>
<p>“There’s no need for practice.” Zhou Wen could do it alone. Furthermore, his order in life would be the highest. The Calamity-grade bullets would only attack him and not Wei Yang and company. There was no point in practicing.</p>
<p>“Then how do you want us to prepare?” Wei Yang asked.</p>
<p>“Just make some preparations. Go back and take a shower and change into clean clothes. It’s best if they have the presidential palace’s emblem on them, so that it’s easy to tell that you are from the presidential palace. That’s all.” Zhou Wen recalled Hui Haifeng’s suggestion from before, so he said to them, “It’s best if you put a flag on your back and write something like Federation Enlisted. It’s easier to let people know who you are representing.</p>
<p>“We are all officers, at least colonels. How can there be any enlisted?” an officer said.</p>
<p>“I didn’t say that you have to be called Federation Enlisted. You can write a name like the Federation Suicide Squad… Of course, this is just my suggestion.” Zhou Wen hurriedly said something else when he realized that the officers’ gazes didn’t look right.</p>
<p>The name ‘Suicide Squad’ was too unlucky. No wonder the officers looked at him strangely.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored them and returned, leaving Wei Yang and company staring at each other.</p>
<p>“Commander, is this Zhou Wen reliable? He didn’t make any plans or do any team building with us. How is he going to lead us? To send us to our deaths?” an officer said indignantly.</p>
<p>“That’s right. What does he take us for? A suicide squad? He’s clearly sending us to our deaths!” The officers didn’t believe that they could enter the rankings without anyone at the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Now, seeing how casual Zhou Wen was, they became even more distrustful.</p>
<p>“Follow what Mr. Zhou said. Go back and prepare. We’ll gather tomorrow morning,” Wei Yang said expressionlessly.</p>
<p>Although he had his doubts, he was still willing to believe Hui Haifeng’s orders.</p>
<p>The next morning, Wei Yang and the other soldiers had already gathered before seven o’clock. When Zhou Wen arrived, they had already lined up and were ready to go.</p>
<p>“You really wrote it!” Zhou Wen realized that everyone was indeed carrying a flag on their backs. The flag was the Federation flag, but on the flag were the words “Federation Suicide Squad” written in white paint. Clearly, they had been added later.</p>
<p>“Isn’t this your order, Mr. Zhou?” Wei Yang said.</p>
<p>They had previously felt that this name was unlucky, but when they thought of how their chances of returning alive were slim if they followed Zhou Wen to take a shot at the rankings, they decided to use the name ‘Suicide Squad.’</p>
<p>“Very good. Let’s set off then. It won’t be too late to come back for breakfast after we get on the rankings.” With that said, Zhou Wen took the lead and walked towards the Cube.</p>
<p>Only then did everyone understand that when Zhou Wen said that it wouldn’t affect breakfast, he meant that he would eat when he returned.</p>
<p>“Damn, now we can only be hungry ghosts,” an officer muttered softly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen heard it, but he didn’t process it. This was because Truth Listener provided him with too many voices. He wasn’t interested in listening to what the officers were saying as he walked towards the Cube.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen and company left the Overseer Manor, An Sheng immediately secretly reported to An Tianzuo, “Overseer, they have set off.”</p>
<p>“Do you think those people can really make it onto the rankings?” An Tianzuo stared in the direction Zhou Wen had left. He held a cup of tea but didn’t drink it.</p>
<p>“Of course. With Young Master Wen around, they can definitely do it. Now it depends on what method they use,” An Sheng replied firmly.</p>
<p>“You sure are confident in him,” An Tianzuo said coldly.</p>
<p>“It’s not that I’m confident, but I’m especially confident. Young Master Wen’s strength is obvious. If the Holy Spirit Association and the League of Guardians can get on the rankings, Young Master Wen can definitely do it. Furthermore, his ranking will definitely be above them,” An Sheng said firmly.</p>
<p>“Let’s hope so,” An Tianzuo said calmly.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The Cube lit up again, immediately attracting the attention of many humans.</p>
<p>“Someone is going to challenge the Venusian dimensional zone again. Who will it be this time?” Everyone was nervous as they watched the live-stream in anticipation.</p>
<p>When they saw more than ten officers carrying the Federation flag on their backs, everyone was stunned.</p>
<p>“Federation Suicide Squad… They really… weren’t particular with this name…”</p>
<p>“Not only are they not particular, they are simply tired of living!”</p>
<p>“I recognize those officers. They should be from the president. Their appearance here means that the presidential palace finally wants to enter the rankings.”</p>
<p>“I know those officers as well. They are all elites from the president’s side, but they should only be at the Mythical stage, right? With just these people, aren’t they dreaming if they want to enter the rankings?”</p>
<p>“Who’s that youth in casual clothes? Why does he look familiar?” Finally, someone focused their attention on Zhou Wen, who wasn’t wearing a military uniform.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was wearing the Heavenly Robe. Although it was wrapped tightly, it didn’t cover his face. Soon, someone recognized him.</p>
<p>“That’s Zhou Wen from Luoyang. He’s an existence second only to the two war gods, An Tianzuo and Leng Zongzheng.”</p>
<p>“So the president hired Zhou Wen. But even if it’s Zhou Wen, it’s impossible for him to appear on the rankings with such Mythical officers? Isn’t the president being too casual with his decision?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1331'>Chapter 1331: Zhou Wen Clears the Level</h3>
<p>The Holy Spirit Association and the League of Guardians were also paying attention to this battle. They naturally weren’t as shallow as the average person and believed that Hui Haifeng would not make such a silly mistake. However, they were very puzzled by Hui Haifeng’s lineup.</p>
<p>Although there weren’t many Terror-grade entities in the presidential palace, they wouldn’t use a group of Mythical entities to make up the numbers, right? This wasn’t something that could be settled with numbers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen unhurriedly led Wei Yang and company to the platform of the metal hemispherical building and entered the dimensional zone by dripping his blood.</p>
<p>“Dripping a drop of blood to enter… This is a situation where they won’t rest until one of them is dead… The presidential palace can’t even find a spatial-type expert… And they actually dared to challenge the rankings?”</p>
<p>As people discussed, Zhou Wen had already given the order to kill the Metal Guard.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng was right. Wei Yang and company were indeed elites. Not only were they well-trained, but they were also very powerful. Due to the usage of the Mythical Serum, all of them had already advanced to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>In a one-on-one or even one-on-two situation, they were not at a disadvantage when fighting the Metal Guards.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw them skillfully blocking the door. The Metal Guards that rushed out were quickly dispatched by them. Occasionally, one or two escaped, but they were killed by an officer who dealt the finishing blow.</p>
<p>With a glance, Zhou Wen knew that they had worked hard to practice and study the dungeon. Furthermore, their research was quite on point.</p>
<p>This method was still effective against the Metal Guards, but it was useless against the Golden Battle Gods, much less the Calamity-grade creature.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen felt that this speed was too slow. Ya’er was still waiting for him to return for breakfast.</p>
<p>Pulling out his Bamboo Blade, Zhou Wen used the saber as a sword and executed the Heart Defying Sword Art. With a slash, all the Metal Guards piled behind the door were killed.</p>
<p>After six slashes, all the Metal Guards were killed. The alarm on one of the doors sounded.</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou, what should we do?” Wei Yang asked. The soldiers looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Wait.” With that said, Zhou Wen walked towards the door with the Bamboo Blade in hand.</p>
<p>The Golden Battle God’s tall and majestic body walked out and shot at Zhou Wen. The Terror-grade bullet was many times faster than the Metal Guards’ bullets.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the Bamboo Blade and ignored the bullets as he charged forward.</p>
<p>Just as everyone thought that Zhou Wen had gone crazy, they saw that the bullet seemed to turn by itself as it avoided Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>Without giving the Golden Battle God a chance to fire a second shot, Zhou Wen’s Bamboo Blade had already stabbed into the Golden Battle God’s body.</p>
<p>With just one strike, it shattered the energy source in its body, causing the Golden Battle God to lose its strength and die. Zhou Wen didn’t even need to deliver a second strike.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew the Golden Battle Gods too well. It was difficult for others to find the location of the energy source immediately, but Zhou Wen didn’t even need to look for it to know where it was.</p>
<p>Although they were displeased with Zhou Wen, the officers still exclaimed in admiration when they saw him kill a Golden Battle God so cleanly.</p>
<p>“That bullet just now acted a little strange!” Cave Era said with a frown.</p>
<p>“So what if it’s a little strange? This is only a Terror-grade Golden Battle God. In front of a Calamity-grade bullet, this move will probably be useless,” Hermit said.</p>
<p>The Golden Battle Gods came out one after another. Zhou Wen held the Bamboo Blade and quickly charged forward, killing all of them with one strike. It was so clean that it left one’s heart cold. No Golden Battle God could withstand a single strike from him.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the situation was rather strange. It was as though every Golden Battle God’s bullet automatically circled around Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Of course, being able to kill them in one strike was mainly because Zhou Wen knew the Golden Battle Gods too well. Not only could he attack their weaknesses, but he could also destroy the energy source. If it were anyone else, even if they were stronger, it would be difficult for them to achieve Zhou Wen’s effect.</p>
<p>It seemed like an ordinary matter to Zhou Wen, but it shocked the Federation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was wearing the Heavenly Robe, and no one discovered any traces of him fusing with a Guardian or using the Mythical Serum. He seemed to be a pure human.</p>
<p>However, a pure human had killed six Terror-grade Golden Battle Gods in the blink of an eye with a single slash. Such a scene was unprecedented.</p>
<p>Although Human Sovereign was known as the strongest human, no one knew if he was a pure human.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s performance was obvious to all.</p>
<p>“Professor Gu, Zhou Wen should be a pure human, right? Apart from Human Sovereign, I’ve never heard of a pure human having such achievements. He killed six Golden Battle Gods using one strike each. Is such a level really something a pure human can achieve?” The host of the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau said excitedly with twinkling eyes.</p>
<p>Professor Gu coughed lightly and explained, “After using the Mythical Serum, there are obvious signs of mutation, but there are also some that aren’t too obvious, especially the Mythical Serum created by humanoid dimensional creatures. After using it, almost no characteristics of the creatures are transferred over. Zhou Wen might also have used such Mythical Serums.”</p>
<p>“Is there no possibility of him being pure human?” The host asked, refusing to give up. Obviously, she was also a patriot and hoped for a high-level pure human powerhouse.</p>
<p>“Of course, the possibility still exists. However, based on the information humans currently have, it’s very difficult. There has yet to be a successful precedent.” Professor Gu seemed to feel that there was no need to continue this topic. He continued, “The information on the Terror-grade Golden Battle Gods has almost been grasped. Killing them isn’t difficult for the top experts of the Federation. The next Calamity-grade bullet is Zhou Wen’s greatest test.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Professor Gu said, “I have a guess. Although it’s just a guess, I can’t think of a greater possibility.”</p>
<p>“Professor Gu, what’s your guess?” the host asked.</p>
<p>Professor Gu said, “The Mythical stage clearly doesn’t play an important role in the Venusian dimensional zone, so why did they bring so many Mythical officers in? Furthermore, we’ve already analyzed it in the past. This Calamity-grade creature can only kill one person at a time. Even the sure-kill seventh shot can’t kill a second person.”</p>
<p>“You mean to say that these Mythical officers are actually there as meat shields? To ultimately achieve the goal of getting Zhou Wen on the rankings?” The host’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>“I didn’t say that. I’m just stating the questions in my heart for everyone’s reference,” Professor Gu said indifferently.</p>
<p>However, Professor Gu’s guess immediately gave many viewers a bad feeling. They felt that it was definitely the case. Otherwise, why would Zhou Wen bring so many useless Mythical officers? They were clearly about to be used as meat shields.</p>
<p>Instantly, there was an outrage on the Internet. To actually use the lives of so many soldiers to get onto the rankings was clearly something that many people could not tolerate.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng instantly became the target of online criticism. He received even more attention than the day he became the Federation President.</p>
<p>Even some officers had similar thoughts. They couldn’t help but secretly retreat, not daring to get too close to Zhou Wen, afraid that he would use them as meat shields.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The Calamity-grade gunshot finally sounded.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1332'>Chapter 1332: Bullet Halo</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“I’ll go in first. You guys can enter later. At the very least, maintain a distance of more than 100 meters from me. Remember not to stand behind me. It’s best if you enter through another door,” Zhou Wen said to Wei Yang and company before walking towards one of the doors. After taking a few steps, he heard a gunshot.</p>
<p>The Calamity-grade bullet was too fast for people’s vision. They only saw Zhou Wen’s figure instant transmit a distance away, and behind him, a hole was punched through the metal wall.</p>
<p>“He dodged it? Instant transmission? This doesn’t make sense!” The hearts of the spectators jumped as Xia Liuchuan said in surprise.</p>
<p>It was no wonder Xia Liuchuan was surprised. Instant transmission was indeed very fast, but it took a certain amount of time to activate it. This time was enough to kill him countless times.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue’s tense nerves relaxed slightly. She thought for a moment and said, “It shouldn’t be instant transmission. It looks like he’s very fast.”</p>
<p>“It’s impossible to dodge a Calamity-grade bullet with pure speed. No matter how fast a Terror-grade is, it’s impossible to be faster than a Calamity-grade. Furthermore, the speed of a bullet is even considered fast among Calamity-grades,” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>“If it was instant transmission, there wouldn’t be any traces left behind, but I saw the remnant traces,” Xia Xuanyue said.</p>
<p>“That’s strange. From the current data, a Calamity-grade attribute has a crushing advantage over a Terror-grade…” Xia Liuchuan naturally trusted Xia Xuanyue because she had a very strong vision.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the Xia family. Many large factions found it unbelievable that Zhou Wen had dodged a Calamity-grade bullet.</p>
<p>“Spatial ability?” Cave Era looked at Jiuyue.</p>
<p>Jiuyue shook his head and said, “No, instant transmission isn’t that fast. He can’t dodge a Calamity-grade bullet unless he can predict the bullet’s arrival time. That’s impossible. There’s no pattern to the Calamity-grade bullet’s timing.”</p>
<p>“Speed? That’s unlikely, right?” Cave Era looked at the screen with a solemn expression.</p>
<p>Such conversations kept repeating among the various factions. No one believed that Zhou Wen could dodge the Calamity-grade bullets with his speed.</p>
<p>The various factions had Terror-grade existences that were known for their speed, but none of them were as fast as Calamity-grade existences. They weren’t even close.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen dodged the bullet and walked through the door.</p>
<p>Wei Yang and company now knew why Zhou Wen didn’t let them stand behind him. Wei Yang led them through another door and took another path.</p>
<p>Indeed, with Zhou Wen attracting the attention of the Calamity-grade creature, no bullets attacked Wei Yang and company as they headed for the Golden Palace.</p>
<p>Not long after Zhou Wen entered the tunnel, a second bullet shot over, but he still managed to dodge it.</p>
<p>With Heavenly Robe’s stats of over 100 Luck, Lucky Dodge was probably maxed out. Zhou Wen didn’t need to move; Heavenly Robe would move his body to dodge the bullet.</p>
<p>Various factions were observing carefully. With their focused attention, it was easier to come to a judgment. They were certain that Zhou Wen didn’t use instant transmission-type abilities. Instead, he dodged the bullet with pure speed.</p>
<p>“This is impossible… How can he be so fast?” Cave Era couldn’t believe that Zhou Wen had such speed.</p>
<p>“It’s not speed,” Immortal who had been silent all this time suddenly said.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>Gunshots kept sounding as Zhou Wen dodged the bullets again and again. None of the bullets hit his body.</p>
<p>“Magical. It’s really magical. This speed is probably comparable to the speed of light, right? It’s a miracle that a human can reach this speed. Professor Gu, what do you think?” the host said excitedly.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s very fast. However, no matter how fast he is, he can’t dodge the fatal seventh shot.” Professor Gu continued deconstructing the situation. “It will definitely consume a lot of energy for a Terror-grade to burst out with the speed needed to dodge a Calamity-grade bullet. According to previous analyses, the seventh shot is a bullet that will never stop unless it kills. Therefore, it’s impossible for Zhou Wen to dodge the seventh shot. From the looks of it, his existence is probably just to be bait. With Zhou Wen stalling for time, the other members of the suicide squad will have a chance of charging into the Golden Palace…”</p>
<p>“You mean to say that Zhou Wen will die under the seventh shot?” the host asked in disbelief.</p>
<p>“I don’t see any possibility of him surviving,” Professor Gu replied with certainty.</p>
<p>“Then let’s wait and see if Zhou Wen will fall under the seventh shot. Regardless, it’s already very impressive for him to reach this stage. For the glory of the Federation and humanity, they have sacrificed too much…” The host seemed to have a good impression of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Professor Gu’s analysis, most people found it reasonable, but those who truly understood Zhou Wen knew that it was impossible for him to do such a thing. He wasn’t that kind of person.</p>
<p>However, many people were still worried for Zhou Wen. At the very least, he looked no different from a human. Compared to the Guardians and the Holy Spirit Association, they were more inclined to support Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen represented the federal government. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that he represented humanity.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen had dodged the first six shots. There was silence in front of the screens. Everyone held their breaths as they heard their hearts beating wildly.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>When the seventh gunshot rang out, many people couldn’t help but tremble. There were even some soft-hearted girls who screamed and covered their faces, not daring to look at the result.</p>
<p>“This… This…” Blood Shaman looked at the scene and his tongue was tied. He couldn’t even say a word.</p>
<p>The other members of the League of Guardians widened their eyes and contracted their pupils as though they had seen something unbelievable.</p>
<p>The people who saw this scene all had the same expression. They opened their mouths and wanted to say something. However, they did not know what to say to express their current feelings.</p>
<p>In the Venusian dimensional zone, the Heavenly Robe on Zhou Wen’s body fluttered like an immortal’s. A shiny halo surrounded him as it constantly flashed.</p>
<p>“What… What’s that… Could it be that the bullet is revolving around Zhou Wen?” someone stammered.</p>
<p>Although ordinary people could only see the halo and not the spinning bullet, as long as they were not stupid, they could roughly guess what it was.</p>
<p>“What the hell? The bullets are circling Zhou Wen, but they aren’t hitting him. Could it be that he has some fling with the Calamity-grade creature on Venus?” Li Xuan widened his mouth in shock. It was enough to swallow a goose egg.</p>
<p>“How did he do it?” Xia Xuanyue was surprised and delighted.</p>
<p>Professor Gu’s eyes were about to pop. He did not speak for a long time.</p>
<p>Different people had the same question.. However, no one was able to answer them.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1333'>Chapter 1333: The Unstoppable Bullets</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen rushed towards the Golden Palace with the spinning bullet around him. The Calamity-grade bullets shot over again, but he dodged them. Before the seventh shot from the second round of bullets was fired, Zhou Wen had already rushed to the steps of the Golden Palace.</p>
<p>However, he did not ascend the steps. Instead, he stopped in front of them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had to thank Hui Haifeng for being here. Since he was working for him, it wasn’t appropriate for him to go up himself, nor could he put his name on the rankings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen didn’t know if the Cube would directly determine their names when they entered the rankings, or if they could write their own names.</p>
<p>It would be better if they could write it themselves. If the Cube determined who he was, Zhou Wen would have to be careful. He couldn’t casually use his other identities to appear on the rankings in the future.</p>
<p>Everyone saw Zhou Wen dodge one bullet after another and finally arrive in front of the Golden Palace. They were excited that Zhou Wen was finally about to reach the destination, but to their surprise, he stopped in front of the steps.</p>
<p>“What’s he doing? He could have gone up before the second round’s seventh shot. Now he’s stopped, won’t he have to take the sure-kill bullet from the second round?” While everyone was puzzled, a gunshot rang out again.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, another halo formed by a rapid spinning bullet appeared around Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“F*ck… That actually works…” Xia Liuchuan jumped up.</p>
<p>No one had ever seen anyone do something like that before. There was no need for him to take the sure-kill bullet, but he chose to stop.</p>
<p>“You’re too showy… We’re both children of our parents, but why are you so showy…”</p>
<p>“What is he trying to do? Who is he showing off to?”</p>
<p>“Is Zhou Wen related to that dimensional creature? Why didn’t he kill him?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood in front of the steps as his body danced with the Heavenly Robe. The halo around him shimmered, making him look like an immortal descending to the mortal world.</p>
<p>He dodged one bullet after another. The third sure-kill bullet formed a halo around him again, but it still failed to hurt him. Everyone began to turn numb towards such a turn of events.</p>
<p>Wei Yang and company were only at the Mythical stage after all, so they weren’t as fast as the Terror grade. They only reached Zhou Wen when the sixth bullet halo formed around him.</p>
<p>Wei Yang and company couldn’t help but be taken aback when they saw Zhou Wen dancing in front of the steps like an immortal with bullet halos around him.</p>
<p>“Go up,” Zhou Wen said to Wei Yang.</p>
<p>Only then did the spectators know that Zhou Wen wasn’t going up himself because he was waiting for Wei Yang and company to do the honors.</p>
<p>“F*ck, what’s the meaning of this? He doesn’t want to go up, but he wants to wait for the others to do it… Is he providing a fighting-substitute service?”</p>
<p>“This isn’t being a fighter-substitute. It should be guaranteed placement, right?”</p>
<p>“Guaranteed placement into the rankings? You can even give that away?”</p>
<p>“That’s way too showy!”</p>
<p>Everyone was rendered speechless as they looked at Zhou Wen, who was surrounded by the halo like a true immortal. Their expressions turned abnormally odd.</p>
<p>This scene was a little different from before. The creatures that had attempted the rankings had tragic outcomes. Each died more miserable than the last. The Holy Spirit Association and the League of Guardians managed to get on the rankings after a thrilling attempt.</p>
<p>However, when it came to Zhou Wen, it was like escorting a primary school student across the road. The scene became extremely discordant.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Wei Yang nodded at Zhou Wen before taking off the Federation flag on his back.</p>
<p>The other members of the ‘Suicide Squad’ followed Wei Yang’s example. They held their flags and followed Wei Yang up the steps.</p>
<p>After Wei Yang and the others reached the top, they raised their flags and waved them—a grand display of ten flags flying high.</p>
<p>“Pfft!” Hui Haifeng spat out the mouthful of water he had just drunk when he saw this scene.</p>
<p>Previously, he had only been joking when he told Zhou Wen to take a flag up. He never expected Zhou Wen to really do it. However, this scene that should have made one’s blood pump with zeal and ardor felt a little funny.</p>
<p>After Wei Yang and company reached the top, the Calamity-grade creature immediately stopped firing. According to the program, a metal bead flew out of the door and landed in Wei Yang and company’s hands. The Cube’s screen switched back to the rankings.</p>
<p>On the ranking board, another name appeared: Federation Suicide Squad.</p>
<p>People didn’t pay attention to what the name was. They were all looking at the end of the words ‘Federation Suicide Squad.’ They wanted to know how many stars they would obtain from this attempt.</p>
<p>“Three stars!” Everyone found three shining stars tailing the name. They immediately crushed the rankings of the Holy Spirit Association and the League of Guardians, and were ranked third.</p>
<p>“Awesome!” Hui Haifeng felt rejuvenated. He originally felt that a single star was sufficient, but now that they had surpassed the Holy Spirit Association and the League of Guardians, he felt very relieved.</p>
<p>Everyone knew the influence of the League of Guardians on the Federation. The presidential palace had little influence, so perhaps a ranking like this was a good start.</p>
<p>Soon, the presidential palace arranged a press conference. Many reporters raised sharp questions on the spot.</p>
<p>For example, was hiring Zhou Wen to get onto the rankings considered a humiliation to the federal government? After all, everyone knew that Zhou Wen was Luoyang’s number three figure.</p>
<p>However, after this battle, many people felt that Zhou Wen wasn’t just ranked third in Luoyang.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng wasn’t angry at all. He looked at them and answered the question, “This question is very silly. Could it be that Zhou Wen isn’t human? Isn’t he a member of the Federation? As a member of the Federation, is it wrong to make contributions to the Federation?”</p>
<p>“Mr. President, is Zhou Wen a pure human?”</p>
<p>“Mr. President, why were those bullets revolving around Zhou Wen?”</p>
<p>“What kind of mystical ability does Zhou Wen have…”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>While Hui Haifeng was holding a press conference, Zhou Wen was very vexed. The six bullets kept revolving around him. Even after leaving the Venusian dimensional zone, the bullets didn’t stop attacking him.</p>
<p>In the past, as long as he exited the game, the bullets would naturally disappear. In reality, it was obviously different. These bullets would not disappear into thin air.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s plan to have breakfast was ruined. He could only think of a way to deal with the six bullets around him. Otherwise, he would have to keep wearing the Heavenly Robe and the Luck equipment.</p>
<p>He definitely had to return the Invincible Lucky Star—he couldn’t keep wearing it.</p>
<p>He tried all kinds of methods—even to the point of walking by the side of a mountain and letting the bullets hit the mountain, but it was useless.</p>
<p>The Calamity-grade bullets seemed to be able to penetrate everything. Nothing could stop them. They would not stop until they killed their target.</p>
<p>The only solution was apparently to find a scapegoat and use their life to take the bullet.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart suddenly stirred. Wait… This might not be a bad thing… These Calamity-grade bullets will constantly revolve around me. Viewing this from another angle, they are equivalent to a weapon of mine… Six Calamity-grade bullets…</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen thought about it, his face almost bloomed with joy.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1334'>Chapter 1334: Returning to Settle Scores</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>These are six sure-kill bullets. Even the Calamity-grade Dragon Turtle couldn’t withstand them. If I can find a Calamity-grade creature… The premise is that if it can’t kill me, all I need to do is rush up and hug it. The six bullets should be enough to kill a Calamity, right? Zhou Wen thought as he took out his phone and entered the dungeon.</p>
<p>However, to his disappointment, there were no bullets surrounding the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>In that case, I can only search for Calamity-grade creatures in reality. Zhou Wen immediately felt that the risk factor was too high.</p>
<p>Heavenly Robe’s Lucky Dodge was indeed amazing, but there was a limit to it. Single-target attacks like bullets were fine, and they might even be very effective against the rain of arrows that covered a wide range.</p>
<p>However, if he encountered an AOE flaming or icy power, there was no room for him to dodge. No matter how high his Lucky Dodge was, it was impossible for him to dodge those attacks.</p>
<p>With this in mind, there were fewer places he could go. The few known Calamity-grade creatures were not easy to approach.</p>
<p>It’s best if I don’t go to Chess Mountain. Drought Demon Fairy couldn’t leave the Fiend Tomb and was only frightened by my words. If I really rush up, I won’t be able to hide once she releases her Heavenly Fire… Zhou Wen thought about it and felt that no matter which Calamity-grade he provoked in reality, it would be very dangerous.</p>
<p>After all, Calamity-grades had their own Calamity Zones, and only a few of them attacked individually.</p>
<p>Is there no Calamity-grade creature like the Dragon Turtle? Zhou Wen searched through his memories, hoping to find a suitable target.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen thought of a place—the Forbidden City he had previously been to.</p>
<p>Now, the owner of the Forbidden City was likely the one inside the log. From what Zhou Wen knew, she had the power of lightning and liked to use lightning for smiting.</p>
<p>That attack seemed dodgeable. With Zhou Wen’s lucky equipment and Heavenly Robe’s dodging abilities, he should be able to dodge it.</p>
<p>I nearly died last time. It’s time to settle this score. Zhou Wen thought to himself, but he didn’t dare immediately head to Forbidden City.</p>
<p>After returning to the Overseer Manor, Zhou Wen went to find the antelope.</p>
<p>This guy was still lazy all day. Other than eating and sleeping, he did nothing else.</p>
<p>Bullets surrounded Zhou Wen. When he entered, the wall near the door instantly shattered. The antelope looked up at him and looked at the bullets in surprise.</p>
<p>“Ahem, Brother Antelope, have you been feeling better recently? Do you want me to buy you some supplements?” Zhou Wen said with a light cough.</p>
<p>“I can’t deal with the bullets around you. Find someone else.” The antelope lazily closed its eyes again.</p>
<p>“No, that’s not what I meant. I just want to ask you. Look at my equipment. Can I dodge the lightning from the fellow in Forbidden City?” Zhou Wen knew that the antelope knew a lot about that fellow. For safety’s sake, he decided to consult it.</p>
<p>“The Heavenly Robe can indeed dodge a Calamity-grade attack with high Luck, but it’s only limited to attacks that can be dodged. It’s useless against large-scale indiscriminate attacks…” The antelope seriously looked at Zhou Wen’s equipment and the six bullets before continuing, “The one from Forbidden City doesn’t just produce single-target attacks.”</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was feeling somewhat disappointed, he heard the antelope say: “But it’s not like you don’t stand a chance. If your plan is good, your six bullets might really make her suffer.”</p>
<p>“What do you plan on doing?” Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. The antelope seemed to be putting way too much effort into this matter, so he stared at it warily.</p>
<p>The antelope chuckled. “I’m not afraid to tell you the truth. My injuries are too serious. I nearly lost my life back on Mount Laojun. Although I’ve recovered a little, the recovery process is too slow. Furthermore, without external help, it’s very difficult for me to fully recover. There are many good things in Forbidden City, and a few of them are of great help to my injuries. If you cooperate with me, how about we split the items obtained from Forbidden City equally?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by even? I’m taking the risk and I have to fight her. All you need to do is speak theory and you want 50% of the spoils?” Zhou Wen naturally disagreed.</p>
<p>“Without me, there’s no chance of getting close to her. I’m providing key technology. As an investor providing the technology, 50% isn’t much,” the antelope said with a smile. “If you’re not afraid of death, you can try doing it yourself.”</p>
<p>“Tell me about the way to safely approach her?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“It’s definitely impossible to fight her head-on. She can activate the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array. When the time comes, you probably won’t even see her, let alone get close to her. It’s even a question if you can escape from the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array.” The antelope lowered its voice and said, “The only way is to ambush her and use the power of the six bullets to finish her off when she’s unprepared.”</p>
<p>“Are you crazy? Sneak an attack on a Calamity-grade? Do you think it’s possible to do so undiscovered?” Zhou Wen didn’t believe that it was as simple as the antelope said.</p>
<p>“You definitely can’t do it yourself. You need my help, so it’s really not much for me to take 50%,” the antelope said.</p>
<p>“What good things are in Forbidden City?” Zhou Wen wondered if he should take the risk.</p>
<p>“There are plenty. After Starlady Polestar returns to the Forbidden City, many hidden dimensional zones there will open…” The antelope’s saliva flew as it recounted what good things were inside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen listened for a while and was really tempted.</p>
<p>“Alright, fifty-fifty. However, you have to tell me the complete plan first. I’ll decide if I want to go. If I do, I’ll definitely give you fifty percent.” Zhou Wen ultimately failed to resist the temptation.</p>
<p>The antelope was very straightforward as it told Zhou Wen its plan in detail.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The weather was terrible during this season in the capital. It was very dry, and there were dust storms. When the wind blew, one’s face would feel itchy because there was too much sand in the air.</p>
<p>Most people were unwilling to go out at this time. Even the shops by the roadside would mostly be closed, and the pedestrians would be in a hurry.</p>
<p>However, there was a blonde girl who looked to be twelve or thirteen years old on the street. Her body was abnormally clean as she slowly sauntered. As she walked, she looked around as if she was looking for something.</p>
<p>The girl was very beautiful. No matter how one looked at her, one could not find a single flaw. She was so perfect that she did not seem like a human. Instead, she looked like a work of art.</p>
<p>“Little girl, the sandstorm outside is strong. Come in and have a cup of milk tea to avoid the wind.” The owner of a milk tea shop seemed to have noticed the blonde girl very early on. When she walked past his shop, he opened the door against the wind and greeted her.</p>
<p>“Ahem, Brother Antelope, have you been feeling better recently? Do you want me to buy you some supplements?” Zhou Wen said with a light cough.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter1335'>Chapter 1335: Sweetie</h3>
<p>“Young lady, what would you like to drink? The most famous thing in my shop is stockings milk tea… Of course, the pearl milk tea here is also very good…” The boss offered with a smile.</p>
<p>“Can I have both?” The blonde girl looked at the beautiful pictures on the brochure and asked expectantly.</p>
<p>“Of course, let’s get you a cup of my best stockings milk tea first.” The smile on the boss’s face deepened as he began to make the milk tea.</p>
<p>Soon, the boss brought a cup of milk tea to the blonde girl and placed it on the table. “Try it. I guarantee you that you won’t be disappointed. You definitely won’t be able to drink a second cup of milk tea that’s this smooth in the capital.”</p>
<p>The blonde girl took a sip of the milk tea and closed her eyes with a blissful expression.</p>
<p>“Is it delicious?” the boss asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, it’s really delicious.” The blond girl took one sip after another and quickly finished the cup of milk tea. She then looked at the shop owner and asked, “You just said that there’s also pearl milk tea. Is it as delicious as this?”</p>
<p>“You’ll know once you try it.” The boss smiled and made a cup of pearl milk tea for the blonde girl.</p>
<p>“This tastes good too!” The blonde girl held the cup, her eyes almost melting from happiness.</p>
<p>Soon, the girl finished another cup of milk tea.</p>
<p>“Do you want to drink something else?” The boss came over and asked.</p>
<p>“Thank you, but there’s no need. I should go,” the blonde girl said as she walked out.</p>
<p>“Wait, you haven’t paid the bill yet?” The boss quickly stopped the blonde girl.</p>
<p>“Bill? What’s that?” The girl looked at the milk tea shop owner in confusion.</p>
<p>Sweetie genuinely didn’t know what money was. The last time she came to Earth was a long time ago. Moreover, at that time, someone took care of her, and Sweetie had never tried to use money.</p>
<p>“Don’t play dumb with me.” The boss’s expression changed immediately. The kind look from before disappeared and was replaced with a fierce look. He reached out to grab Sweetie’s arm and said fiercely, “How dare you drink milk tea when you are penniless? You better…”</p>
<p>The boss’s palm touched Sweetie’s arm, and his voice came to an abrupt halt. A golden light lit up at his fingertips. The golden light instantly spread to his entire body and turned him into gold.</p>
<p>It was real gold that even shone with a golden light. It was like a 24K pure gold statue. It still maintained a fierce expression while reaching out to grab Sweetie.</p>
<p>Sweetie looked at the boss who had turned into a golden statue. She sighed and shook her head, then walked out of the shop.</p>
<p>Soon, a customer came into the milk tea shop and was shocked to see the golden statue.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took Ya’er, Chick, and the antelope to the capital. As he walked, he browsed the news on the Internet.</p>
<p>He originally wanted to see the recent situation in Forbidden City. He wanted to know if humans had already explored the interior. It would be best if he could obtain information about the interior of Forbidden City.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t find any information about the Forbidden City. Instead, he saw many media headlines reporting about golden statues.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a casual look and realized that there were suddenly many golden statues in the capital. These golden people looked identical to the real people in real life, and the gold was pure gold.</p>
<p>However, according to the investigation of the capital’s police station, every golden statue was built using real people as the template, and those who looked identical to the golden statue had all gone missing.</p>
<p>Everyone was discussing this matter. Some people suspected that a powerful dimensional creature had entered the capital and turned those people into golden statues.</p>
<p>Some people said that this was a prank. Some even said that this was a sign that a Calamity-grade creature was about to appear.</p>
<p>In any case, there were all kinds of things being said, causing everyone in the capital to be in a panic. Many people did not dare to go out, afraid that they would also turn into golden statues.</p>
<p>No wonder there are so few people on the streets in the capital. So that’s why. Zhou Wen came to a realization. He had previously found it odd that the capital looked much more desolate than before.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Zhou Wen thought that after Xia Jiuhuang died, the Xia family declined, which led to the capital’s decline. It turned out that it was caused by the golden statues.</p>
<p>“Antelope, what do you think of these golden statues?” Zhou Wen read the news about the golden statues to the antelope.</p>
<p>After the antelope heard that, it frowned and pondered. “Although turning a person into gold isn’t a very powerful ability, it’s still a very rare ability. If a creature really has such an ability, it’s probably at the Mythical stage or above. The possibility of it being at the Terror grade is higher.”</p>
<p>“Since it’s possible to be above the Mythical stage, why is the possibility of being at the Terror grade higher? Can’t it be at the Calamity grade?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“If it’s a Calamity-grade, it wouldn’t be just these few people turning into gold. Besides, unless a Calamity-grade has nothing better to do, why would they run around turning ordinary people into gold?” the antelope said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought about it and realized that it made sense. However, this had nothing to do with them. Their destination was Forbidden City and they wouldn’t stay in the capital for long. Their luck was unlikely to be so unlucky to encounter the monster that could turn people into gold.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>As Sweetie walked, she sensed Zhou Wen’s aura. After arriving on Earth, she first went to Sweetie’s Hut before heading to the capital.</p>
<p>As Yana had sent information on Zhou Wen to Sweetie before she died, she could sense Zhou Wen’s aura and knew that he was approaching that direction. Therefore, she planned on waiting for him.</p>
<p>Sweetie had only wanted to wait quietly for Zhou Wen’s arrival, but she never expected humans to have declined to such a state. Every human who touched her turned into a golden statue without exception.</p>
<p>In fact, it was not Sweetie who intentionally turned them into golden statues. It was just an additional power that was automatically generated from her body. As long as it was a creature with evil intentions or a sinful person, they would turn into golden statues when they touched her.</p>
<p>If it was a kind-hearted person, there wouldn’t be any problems if they touched her. However, up until now, everyone who touched Sweetie had turned into gold.</p>
<p>Has humanity fallen to such a state? I can’t even find a kind person. It’s no wonder that bad person killed Yana. He must be a super bad person. Sweetie had already sensed Zhou Wen’s arrival and walked towards him.</p>
<p>From afar, she saw Zhou Wen carrying Ya’er and walking down the street with the antelope and bird. Sweetie walked towards him.</p>
<p>Such a baddie will definitely turn into gold the moment he touches me. It can be considered revenge for Yana, Sweetie thought as she deliberately walked towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw Sweetie, he couldn’t help but take a few more looks. The blonde girl was just too beautiful. She was like a doll, one that looked flawlessly beautiful.</p>
<p>When Sweetie brushed past Zhou Wen, she seemed to accidentally slip. She staggered and fell towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1336'>Chapter 1336: Entering the Forbidden City Again</h3>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen dodged to the side. Without looking to see if Sweetie had fallen, he turned around and instant transmitted.</p>
<p>Do you think I’m a fool? I’ve always been in my Terror form. Ordinary people can’t see me at all. Besides, there are Calamity-grade bullets spinning around me. Not only can this girl see me, but she can even pass through the bullets and fall towards me. How can such a person slip? Are you kidding me? Zhou Wen carried Ya’er and instant transmitted away with Chick on his shoulder.</p>
<p>The antelope wasn’t slow either. It ran immediately, so fast that its shadow couldn’t be seen. It was in no way slower than Zhou Wen’s instant transmission.</p>
<p>The two of them unanimously ran in the same direction, towards Forbidden City.</p>
<p>Clearly, they all believed that Sweetie’s strength was extremely terrifying. If they were to try to escape normally, there was a high chance they wouldn’t make it. If they fled to the Forbidden City, they might be able to pit the enemy against another and obtain a chance to catch their breath.</p>
<p>Sweetie was still in a daze. She thought that a normal person would definitely help her up, but in her eyes, something normal was not normal at all.</p>
<p>Normal people couldn’t see Zhou Wen, much less pass through the bullet halo. To Sweetie, this couldn’t be any more normal.</p>
<p>Bam! Sweetie fell to the ground and watched in a daze as Zhou Wen and the antelope vanished. After a while, she got up hatefully. He’s indeed a bad person. He didn’t even help me up.</p>
<p>This made Sweetie even more determined to avenge Yana. After sensing Zhou Wen’s location, Sweetie chased after him.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen reached Forbidden City with instant transmission, he realized that the antelope had already arrived. It was even faster than him.</p>
<p>“She didn’t chase after us?” Zhou Wen asked when he saw the antelope standing outside Forbidden City without entering. It didn’t look flustered.</p>
<p>“Probably not. I didn’t sense her following us,” the antelope said firmly. Clearly, it was very confident in its senses.</p>
<p>“Could that girl be the culprit who has turned humans into gold?” Zhou Wen guessed.</p>
<p>“Maybe. Anyway, she’s not simple. Even I can’t see through her. She’s definitely at the Calamity grade.” The antelope looked around but didn’t find any traces of Sweetie.</p>
<p>“Let’s enter the city now. Even if she catches up, she will suffer limitations inside,” Zhou Wen said as he walked towards the entrance of Forbidden City.</p>
<p>“Don’t take the main entrance. Follow me.” The antelope stopped Zhou Wen and headed in another direction along the city walls.</p>
<p>They walked in front while Sweetie followed not far behind them. However, Zhou Wen and the antelope didn’t see her. It was as though she was invisible.</p>
<p>What are the two of them sneaking around for? Sweetie walked to Zhou Wen’s side. She originally wanted to push him and turn him into gold, but when she saw the two of them sneaking around, her curiosity was piqued. She retracted her hand.</p>
<p>Sweetie squatted by the side and watched the antelope and Zhou Wen crawl through a dog hole. She thought to herself, What are they trying to do?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had tried his best to be careful when he crawled in, but the dog hole was just too small. A portion of the wall’s bricks shattered as a result of the bullets around him.</p>
<p>Fortunately, after they crawled in, it was an empty courtyard. Other than some plants, there were no other living creatures.</p>
<p>That blonde girl shouldn’t have caught up. Zhou Wen lay prone in the grass and used Truth Listener to listen. Having not discovered any traces of the blonde girl in the vicinity, he felt slightly relieved.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t know that Sweetie was crouched beside him. She was less than a foot away from him and could reach out to touch his hair.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t seem like she was coming for us. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have given up so easily.” The antelope lay in the grass and looked around. It didn’t notice Sweetie and spat on the ground. It cursed, “Nothing good comes from following you out.”</p>
<p>Sweetie crouched there and listened in on their conversation with great interest.</p>
<p>“How do you know that the girl was coming for me? Perhaps she was coming for you,” Zhou Wen said with a pout.</p>
<p>“Pui! I haven’t been out and about for millennia, but the moment I did, I encountered you, an unlucky piece of trash. How could I possibly have the opportunity to offend such a powerful enemy?” The antelope said in a very displeased manner.</p>
<p>“Let’s not talk about that for now. After all, she didn’t chase after us. Let’s stick to the plan and deal with Starlady Polestar first,” Zhou Wen suggested.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s act according to the plan. We mustn’t make any mistakes. Otherwise, both of us will suffer greatly. The current Starlady Polestar is nothing like last time when she just freed herself,” the antelope exhorted again.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I know what to do.” Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to scan his surroundings.</p>
<p>Truth Listener received too much sound information. Zhou Wen still couldn’t analyze what all the sounds were, but he could accurately pinpoint a portion of the sounds he wanted to hear. It was much better than before.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen heard everything around him.</p>
<p>Forbidden City was indeed very different from before. Although its layout still followed the Eight-Arm Nezha’s setup, there were many independent dimensional zones in the city now.</p>
<p>The situation was roughly similar to Dragon Gate Grotto. They were both large dimensional zones that contained many smaller dimensional zones.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Truth Listener’s strength had improved greatly. Otherwise, Zhou Wen probably wouldn’t have been able to hear the situation outside the courtyard because it was a dimensional zone.</p>
<p>“Strange, what is this place? There’s not a single dimensional creature. Why is this area only a small independent dimensional zone?” As Zhou Wen spoke, he glanced at the dog hole they had crawled through and continued, “Furthermore, why would a dog hole exist in Forbidden City, which has already transformed into a dimensional zone?”</p>
<p>“Don’t be surprised. The dog hole was a part of Forbidden City, so of course it can exist. As for this place, you should have seen the map of Forbidden City before, right? Don’t you know that this is the legendary Cold Palace?” the antelope said.</p>
<p>Cold Palace! Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>Of course, he had heard of the Cold Palace. It was the place where the emperor banished concubines who had committed crimes. However, it was empty here and there were no concubines.</p>
<p>“If it weren’t for the fact that the Cold Palace is isolated from other areas, we would have long been discovered by Starlady Polestar after causing such a huge commotion here. This is one of the few places where Starlady Polestar won’t pay attention to. However, we have to move quickly. If she has a sudden impulse to look over here, we’ll be in trouble,” the antelope said as it slammed its head into the door of the Cold Palace. After shattering the door, it ran out.</p>
<p>The dimensional creatures outside were immediately attracted by it and chased after the antelope.</p>
<p>As per the agreement, Zhou Wen waited for the antelope to lure the dimensional creatures away and cause chaos before sneaking in another direction.</p>
<p>Sweetie looked in the direction the antelope left in, then at Zhou Wen, before walking towards him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1337'>Chapter 1337: Successfully Completed the Plan</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“Starlady Polestar, is this how you treat your old friend and savior?” the antelope shouted as it ran.</p>
<p>From time to time, it would stomp at the dimensional creatures blocking the way, shattering the soldiers in Star Armor. It looked very impressive.</p>
<p>However, there were just too many soldiers in Forbidden City. The ones killed by the antelope were only a drop in the ocean. Soldiers wearing all kinds of Star Armor constantly surged over, and more and more of them appeared.</p>
<p>Those soldiers were quite strange. When there were only one or two soldiers, they looked quite ordinary and did not have much combat strength. However, as more soldiers gathered, each soldier’s combat strength became stronger and stronger, seemingly limitless.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you just stay on Mount Laojun to await death? Why did you come here?” Starlady Polestar’s voice came from the Hall of Supreme Harmony.</p>
<p>“Pui, pui, pui. I’m still in my prime. It won’t be a problem for me to live for another thousand lifetimes. Even if you die a hundred times, I still won’t be dead,” said the antelope as it spat.</p>
<p>“Since you are speaking, it means that you have already lost your bet with him. What’s the use of living for so long? You might as well die. If I were you, I would just kill myself to avoid making a fool of myself,” said Starlady Polestar coldly.</p>
<p>Starlady Polestar seemed to hit the antelope’s sore spot. The antelope immediately flew into a rage out of humiliation. “That’s because I think there’s no point in winning. I deliberately let him win once. Otherwise, how could I lose? Besides, what has this got to do with you? Since when was it your turn to spout nonsense? You’d better mind your own business. Open your eyes wide and take a good look into the future to prevent yourself from being deceived again.”</p>
<p>“Say that again?” Starlady Polestar also seemed infuriated.</p>
<p>“I’m advising caution. Don’t be deceived by others again. Is that wrong? This is for your own good. I don’t want you to be deceived again. For the dignified Starlady Polestar to be abandoned by someone and to lead a depressing life worse than death, that’s just too sad. Even a bystander like me can’t stand watching…” Not only did the antelope repeat those words, it added more.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Purple lightning descended from the sky and struck the antelope.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, Little Star, are you serious?” The antelope jumped and dodged the lightning strikes again and again in a sorry state. As it jumped, it shouted, “Little Star, no matter what, I’m your savior. Without me, you would still be buried and eating dirt. Now that you’ve grown capable, you actually dare to smite me with Firmament Lightning. Do you want me to spank your butt…”</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The lightning exploded like a bolt from the blue. Purple lightning descended from the sky as though a sea of lightning was pouring down—it would not stop until it diced the antelope into pieces.</p>
<p>“I came to visit you out of goodwill, but you’re actually so heartless. If I knew this would happen, I wouldn’t have gotten that punk to carry that bag of sh*t over…” The antelope kept spewing all sorts of vulgarities.</p>
<p>With a clang, the door of the Hall of Supreme Harmony was smashed open. A piece of charred wood tore out and stood erect on the roof like a lightning rod.</p>
<p>After the charred wood appeared, the entire sky above Forbidden City emitted purple light. Clouds gathered and the stars in the sky emitted a brilliance which overlapped and descended from the sky, illuminating the entire Forbidden City.</p>
<p>Now, it was no longer just lightning that descended, but the brilliance of thousands of stars. They were like countless crisscrossing beams of light that sliced at the antelope.</p>
<p>“Little Star, do you really want my life!?” The antelope cried out as it moved rapidly like a phantom. It used the buildings in Forbidden City to avoid the terrifying starlight assault.</p>
<p>The buildings that were originally protected by the dimensional zone’s nomological powers—thus making them virtually indestructible—were easily penetrated by the starlight. Soon, the starlight struck the antelope, causing it to scream.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed the agreement with the antelope and constantly changed his location and route. He traveled unobstructed amidst the starlight array and quickly sneaked to the Hall of Supreme Harmony’s vicinity.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t immediately take action. He hid nearby and waited for the opportunity the antelope mentioned.</p>
<p>Sweetie walked over with Zhou Wen. The starlight failed to injure her at all. It was as though the starlight—like Zhou Wen—failed to discover her.</p>
<p>There was another explosion in the sky. The stars shifted and the stars in the sky changed. One of the purple stars was like the core of the world. It was surrounded by the other stars and shone with strange starlight.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the purple star appear, looking identical to the antelope’s description, Zhou Wen no longer hesitated. He instant transmitted in front of the charred wood and hugged it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was very familiar with this log. Back then, he had carried it all the way to Forbidden City. However, although the current log’s size and appearance were the same as before, its texture was completely different.</p>
<p>It still looked charred, but it was as hard and smooth as jade. It was also abnormally cold.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because all her attention was on the antelope, or because she was at a critical moment controlling the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, Starlady Polestar, who was inside the charred wood, failed to react in time and was hugged by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The six Calamity-grade bullets that surrounded Zhou Wen like a stellar ring slammed into the charred wood, producing six bullet holes.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Zhou Wen immediately heard a woman’s tragic cry from the charred wood. The Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array in the sky immediately collapsed.</p>
<p>“It’s done!” Zhou Wen was delighted when the six Calamity Bullets didn’t fly out again.</p>
<p>“Get out of the way.” The antelope descended from the sky and kicked the charred wood, toppling it from the roof. Then, it opened its mouth and spat out a yellow paper talisman, sticking it on the charred wood.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already retreated to the side and sized up the charred wood that had been pasted with a yellow paper talisman by the antelope. He saw the charred wood constantly tremble violently as though it would shatter at any moment.</p>
<p>He couldn’t help but feel shocked. Starlady Polestar remained alive despite being hit by six sure-kill bullets. Her strength was unimaginably terrifying for her to still resist at this stage.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was very glad that he hadn’t come alone to settle the score with her. Otherwise, he might not have returned alive today.</p>
<p>The yellow paper talisman on the charred wood kept flickering with golden light as though it was suppressing Starlady Polestar.</p>
<p>However, seeing the charred wood shake so violently, Zhou Wen asked worriedly, “Is there a problem with your yellow paper talisman?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I guarantee that nothing can go wrong with my stuff. She definitely won’t be able to rush out in at least 24 hours. Don’t write this yellow paper talisman off just because it doesn’t look remarkable. It has a great origin. As long as it’s pasted on, unless someone helps her tear it off, it’s impossible for anyone to rush out in a short period of time. Besides, she suffered six bullets from you. She must be seriously injured. Just follow me to pick up the treasures in peace,” the antelope said smugly.</p>
<p>These two guys are really big baddies! With me, Sweetie, around, how can I let you evil people have your way? I must make you pay for your evil deeds.. Sweetie came in front of the charred wood and reached out to tear off the yellow paper talisman.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter1338'>Chapter 1338: Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen and the antelope were just about to head to Forbidden City to make a clean sweep of the treasures when they suddenly felt that something was amiss. It was as though the vibration of the charred wood had stopped. They felt that something was wrong as a chill ran down their back. They turned their heads involuntarily.</p>
<p>With a glance, Zhou Wen and the antelope’s expressions changed drastically. They saw the yellow paper talisman that had been stuck to the log gently float down.</p>
<p>“Ol’ Ante, did you forget to apply glue?” Zhou Wen gulped and asked with some difficulty.</p>
<p>“That thing doesn’t seem to need glue, if I recall correctly?” The antelope was a little unsure. It could not figure out why the yellow paper talisman would fall. It should not have fallen after it was stuck on it.</p>
<p>“Can you stick it on again?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>Before the antelope could answer him, an explosion in the sky gave him an answer. Purple lightning descended from the sky and directly reduced the yellow paper talisman to ashes.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me that talisman of yours is fake?” Zhou Wen retreated as he spoke, already having thoughts of escaping.</p>
<p>“That shouldn’t have happened!” The antelope was also retreating.</p>
<p>The human and antelope turned to run, but the starlight in the sky gathered. Thousands of stars enveloped the Forbidden City, and the starlight seemed to isolate the Forbidden City in its entirety from the mortal world.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed to discover that Singularity Universe’s teleportation ability couldn’t teleport him out of here. All he could do was desperately run in the direction of the Forbidden City’s gates.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>He heard the sound of wood cracking behind him. When he turned his head, he saw that the charred wood had already split into two. A female Guardian dressed in purple armor and an ink-black cape that resembled a monarch floated in midair. Her eyes that seemed to contain the stars of the universe were staring angrily at Zhou Wen and the antelope.</p>
<p>There were six bullet holes on her armor that were oozing blood.</p>
<p>However, it seemed that such an injury was not fatal.</p>
<p>With the appearance of Starlady Polestar, the starlight in the sky gathered on her body. It was as if she had become the focus of the spotlight. The other places became dim, and she had the starlight from thousands of stars gathered over her.</p>
<p>In the intense starlight, blood spewed out from the bullet holes. At the same time, the spinning bullets were sucked out by the starlight and floated in front of Starlady Polestar.</p>
<p>Starlady Polestar’s eyes narrowed. Starlight fell and turned into swords of starlight. They poured down like a galaxy’s slide down and flew past Starlady Polestar.</p>
<p>The six bullets were instantly slashed to pieces in the starlight river. As for the countless swords of starlight, they surged towards Zhou Wen and the antelope at an unbelievable speed, reaching the speed of light.</p>
<p>“Wind, pull…” The antelope shouted and spat out a talisman. The talisman turned into clouds and enveloped its four hooves, causing its speed to increase drastically as it charged towards the gates of Forbidden City.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen cursed inwardly. The antelope could produce the speed of a Calamity-grade. Perhaps it could match Starlady Polestar’s speed.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t have that ability. All he could do was charge forward with all his might.</p>
<p>However, the swords of starlight weren’t slower than the Calamity-grade bullets. How could Zhou Wen outrun them? Soon, a large number of swords of starlight stabbed into his back.</p>
<p>Thankfully, his Luck attributes and Heavenly Robe’s Lucky Dodge showcased their effects. Zhou Wen’s Heavenly Robe fluttered as he constantly dodged the rain of swords. None of the swords of starlight could hit him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t feel any joy. Although he hadn’t been stabbed to death for the time being, Starlady Polestar appeared even more terrifying than the Calamity-grade creature in the Venusian dimensional zone. It wasn’t impossible for her to crack Lucky Dodge.</p>
<p>As long as they didn’t rush out of Forbidden City, everything was still unknown. It wasn’t time to rejoice.</p>
<p>The antelope ran very quickly and arrived in front of Forbidden City’s gates in almost an instant. However, the swords of starlight descended from the sky and transformed into layers of airtight sword walls, completely sealing off the way out.</p>
<p>The antelope’s body glowed brightly as it opened its mouth to spit out a cloud. The cloud hit the sword wall, and although it repelled quite a number of swords of starlight, it ultimately failed to break through and was dispersed by the river of starlight swords.</p>
<p>The endless stream of swords that resembled a galactic river rushed towards the antelope, instantly causing it to fall into the dense array of swords. It tried to charge in various directions but failed to escape.</p>
<p>“Ahem, Starlady, it’s just a joke. There’s no need to take it seriously, right?” the antelope said to Starlady Polestar in the air as it blocked the endless sword streams.</p>
<p>“Then continue your joke.” With Starlady Polestar’s cold voice, the starlight sword river became even more violent. It transformed into a terrifying sword array that surrounded Zhou Wen and the antelope.</p>
<p>Greed is indeed an original sin. I shouldn’t have been greedy and followed Antelope to this godforsaken place. Zhou Wen cursed inwardly.</p>
<p>Although Lucky Dodge could temporarily save Zhou Wen’s life, it was only an evasion ability. It didn’t allow Zhou Wen to forcefully break through the sword wall.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled. With the antelope’s personality, it definitely wouldn’t fight a battle it wasn’t confident in. Since it was willing to take the risk, it was definitely confident.</p>
<p>However, it was peculiar that the yellow paper talisman would fall.</p>
<p>Now wasn’t the time to consider this. Zhou Wen’s mind raced as he tried to think of a way to escape.</p>
<p>Lucky Dodge could save his life, but it was impossible to crack the starlight sword array. Furthermore, the swords formed from starlight had already reached the speed of light. Zhou Wen’s speed couldn’t keep up, so it was impossible to crack the sword array.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried his best to use Truth Listener’s ability. In the sword array, the amount of sound he received was much lesser. Most of the sound information was related to the starlight sword array.</p>
<p>After listening for a while, Zhou Wen suddenly realized that the starlight sword array seemed very familiar to him.</p>
<p>Isn’t this the twenty-eight Lunar Mansion skill? Zhou Wen immediately realized something.</p>
<p>When he was in the Endless Sea of Stars, he had always wanted to obtain two skills. One was Star Stealer, and the other was the twenty-eight Lunar Mansion skill.</p>
<p>It was the lowest-level skill, but it was abnormally difficult to have it drop. Out of the 28 skills, Zhou Wen only had 27. He hadn’t had the last one drop.</p>
<p>The 27 Lunar Mansion skills that Zhou Wen knew were all protective skills. They weren’t offensive, so Zhou Wen didn’t connect the two in the beginning.</p>
<p>The peculiarity he felt allowed him to realize that although the starlight sword array was an offensive sword array, it was in a similar vein as the Lunar Mansion skills.</p>
<p>If the pattern of changes in this sword stance is the same as the Lunar Mansion skills, then wouldn’t I be able to predict the future? Even if my speed can’t keep up with the speed of the swords of starlight, I can still predict their positions… However, I’m still lacking one Lunar Mansion skill… As Zhou Wen thought, he used Truth Listener to secretly observe the sword array.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1339'>Chapter 1339: Comprehending the Lunar Mansions</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen could still rely on his Lucky Dodge to protect himself, but the antelope relied on its own strength to withstand the sword array. Only then did Zhou Wen realize that the antelope was quite powerful.</p>
<p>Although the antelope couldn’t rush out of the sword array, it managed to withstand wave after wave of sword array attacks. It had all sorts of means—one moment, it would spew lightning, and the next moment, it would use wind and fire. It was unknown what attributes it had, but it seemed to be able to easily control all kinds of elemental abilities.</p>
<p>Although the antelope was already very impressive, it could only barely protect itself in the sword array. It was still in a sorry state.</p>
<p>“Starlady, no matter what, we suffered together back then and were good comrades who fought bosses together. There’s no need to be so ruthless, right? If you’re really angry, you can just beat that punk up to vent your anger. Why make things difficult for an old friend? If it doesn’t appease you, I’ll help you beat him up.” The antelope spoke with emotion and reason.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Starlady Polestar didn’t buy it at all. She snorted and said, “We suffered together? I never expected that from you? When we were trapped in the Crystal Palace, we were almost exhausted, but you secretly ate and drank well. Afraid of being discovered by us, you pretended to be on your deathbed and wanted to trick us into handing over our inheritance. I can’t afford to have a friend like you, nor do I have a comrade like you.”</p>
<p>The antelope blushed, but it was thick-skinned after all. Having experienced all kinds of upheavals, it coughed to hide its embarrassment and changed the topic. “Let’s not talk about the past. Last time, I got that punk to dig you out and take you back to Forbidden City. It was really out of good intentions. I originally planned to get that punk to form a contract with you and help you find a good contractor, but who knew that things would turn out this way? I still treat you as a friend from the bottom of my heart and consider your wellbeing, Starlady. That punk is a rare genius. Others fought over each other for him, but I couldn’t bear to give him to them. Instead, I brought him to you…”</p>
<p>“Him? You have the nerve to call a person who relies on luck a rare genius?” Starlady Polestar mocked.</p>
<p>She could long tell that Zhou Wen relied on his Lucky Dodge to dodge the sword array’s attacks.</p>
<p>“Starlady, let’s not talk about anything else, but how many people can advance to the Mythical stage as humans? Even in our era, you haven’t seen many, right? He hasn’t contracted a Guardian yet. It’s not too late for you to contract him now.” The antelope tried its best to persuade her, but its situation was getting worse. Sword beams had already swept past its body and shaved off its fur.</p>
<p>“Oh, he advanced to the Mythical stage purely as a human?” Starlady Polestar finally sized up Zhou Wen seriously.</p>
<p>“It’s absolutely true. If I lie, I’ll give my head to you to kick like a ball.” The antelope swore an oath, wishing it could bear its heart to Starlady Polestar.</p>
<p>“So what if I am? Do I need to borrow the power of humans? As long as I am willing, even if I contract with a piece of trash, I can rule the world.” Starlady Polestar said indifferently, “You don’t have to waste your breath. No matter what you say, you will die without a doubt today.”</p>
<p>After she finished speaking, a star crown appeared on her forehead. The stars in the sky resonated with it. The stars that were originally hidden in the universe and couldn’t be seen appeared one after another, almost occupying the entire sky.</p>
<p>Starlight descended the very next moment as if the end of the world had arrived. Everything visible to the naked eye was occupied by starlight.</p>
<p>“F*ck, you old b*tch, am I not submissive enough?? Do you really think that I have nothing on me?” When Ol’ Ante saw this scene, it immediately ripped off its facade and returned to how it was previously—a hooligan. It opened its mouth and spat out a talisman. At the same time, the blood it spat out landed on the talisman, causing it to emit a bright light and forcefully block the sky above.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>The starlight fell on the canopy-like spiritual talisman. Like steel nails piercing into a steel plate, half of them pierced through. Soon, the spiritual talisman was like a hedgehog.</p>
<p>Blood kept gushing out of the antelope’s mouth as it frantically injected its Essence Energy into the spirit talisman to prevent it from shattering.</p>
<p>However, every starlight that stabbed the spirit talisman caused the antelope’s body to tremble. The more starlight that fell, the more the antelope trembled, and the more blood it bled from its mouth.</p>
<p>Starlady Polestar originally didn’t pay attention to Zhou Wen. She knew what kind of ability Lucky Dodge was and how to crack it. Under the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, starlight fell en masse and there was no space to dodge. It was useless no matter how high the probability of Lucky Dodge was. It was ultimately difficult to escape death.</p>
<p>However, moments later, Starlady Polestar realized that Zhou Wen wasn’t dead. She was somewhat surprised; she took a closer look and couldn’t help but be alarmed.</p>
<p>Starlight shimmered around Zhou Wen as though he was surrounded by a galaxy. The stellar sword beams that landed on him were like rain falling into the sea. They fused into the stellar halo around him, causing it to glow brighter and stronger.</p>
<p>“The twenty-eight Lunar Mansions?” Starlady Polestar looked at Zhou Wen in surprise.</p>
<p>She was the Lady of the Stars, so how could she not recognize the power Zhou Wen used?</p>
<p>Due to the lack of one Lunar Mansion skill, Zhou Wen had never used the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions. By observing Starlady Polestar’s Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, he found the part he was lacking. He reverse engineered the Lunar Mansion skill he lacked and finally gathered all twenty-eight.</p>
<p>Using Singularity Universe to power the twenty-eight Lunar Mansion skills and constantly observing the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, he finally understood why the twenty-eight Lunar Mansion skills were so difficult to obtain despite their low levels.</p>
<p>These skills were not as simple as individual skills. Like the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, they could form an array, and its power would increase by several times. Even if it was a low-level skill, after combining 28 skills into an array, its power was immeasurable.</p>
<p>However, it was somewhat different from Starlady Polestar’s starlight sword array which focused on offense. Zhou Wen’s Lunar Mansion skills focused on defense.</p>
<p>The defensive net formed by the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions array could not only resist the external forces, but it could also absorb external Essence Energy.</p>
<p>If it were any other Guardian’s power, the Lunar Mansions array might not have been able to withstand it in the beginning, nor would it have absorbed the powers so smoothly.</p>
<p>However, the starlight sword array and the Lunar Mansions array shared the same origin. They were almost of the same attribute. After the starlight fell into the Lunar Mansions array, it was immediately absorbed without any rejection.</p>
<p>This made Zhou Wen’s Lunar Mansions array stronger and stronger. Furthermore, by observing the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, Zhou Wen constantly perfected the Lunar Mansions array.</p>
<p>After Starlady Polestar watched for a while, the surprise on her face deepened. Zhou Wen’s Lunar Mansions array wasn’t limited to the variations of the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions. It had even begun to evolve in the direction of the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1340'>Chapter 1340: Death Everywhere</h3>
<p>As they stemmed from the same origin and their circulation trajectories were becoming more and more similar, coupled with the absorption characteristics of the Lunar Mansion Array, it failed to kill Zhou Wen, even though Starlady Polestar’s Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array was much stronger than Zhou Wen’s. Instead, a lot of starlight was sucked away.</p>
<p>Of course, this was also because Starlady Polestar wasn’t targeting Zhou Wen. She had focused most of her attention on the antelope, planning on killing Zhou Wen in passing.</p>
<p>That antelope wasn’t completely lying. It’s fine if he knows the Lunar Mansion Array, but he can actually reverse engineer the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array. That isn’t easy. Starlady Polestar looked at Zhou Wen with a hint of hesitation.</p>
<p>Starlady Polestar naturally wouldn’t agree to contract a good-for-nothing. If she could find a powerful partner, why lead a fool to conquer the world?</p>
<p>She had only said those words to the antelope to show her determination.</p>
<p>Upon seeing that not only did Zhou Wen know the Lunar Mansion Array, but he could also reverse engineer the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, Starlady Polestar was somewhat tempted.</p>
<p>The Essence Energy Arts and skills Zhou Wen used were very compatible with her abilities. Coupled with Zhou Wen’s outstanding perception, it would indeed save her a lot of time and trouble if she could contract with him.</p>
<p>There was another important point. Zhou Wen was already at the Mythical stage. After contracting with him, Starlady Polestar no longer needed to hide in the log inside Forbidden City, nor would she be rejected and suppressed by Earth’s laws.</p>
<p>However, when she recalled how Zhou Wen had ruined her plans back then and how she had been schemed against by Zhou Wen again, she couldn’t take it lying down if she let him off just like that.</p>
<p>Starlady Polestar came up with an idea. She thought to herself, So you are perceptive and fond of learning? Then I’ll teach you a good lesson.</p>
<p>Starlady Polestar powered the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, making it constantly transform in a deliberate attempt to show Zhou Wen its variability.</p>
<p>Starlady Polestar wasn’t doing this out of good intentions. The universe was endless and there were countless stars. It was almost impossible to fully comprehend the changes in all the stars in the universe.</p>
<p>There was a limit to life, and there was a limit to one’s brain power. However, the universe was infinite. To comprehend the infinite universe with limited life and brainpower, it was fine if he only wanted to steal some insight from it, but if he really wanted to completely comprehend it, then it was equivalent to forcefully filling a water bottle with only a capacity of one liter with the seawater of the Pacific Ocean. It was needless to say that the bottle would explode.</p>
<p>Starlady Polestar was able to master the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array because of her innate talent. If she didn’t have such talent, even she wouldn’t dare to say that she could remember all the variations in the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array.</p>
<p>It was also impossible to remember them all, because there were infinite variations.</p>
<p>She made up her mind. If Zhou Wen couldn’t comprehend the various profundities of the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array and gave up midway, it meant that Zhou Wen’s talent was nothing much. It didn’t matter if he was killed. There was no need to feel pity.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen really continued comprehending, he would probably go crazy without her doing anything.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Starlady Polestar didn’t plan on letting Zhou Wen off. He would die either way.</p>
<p>Due to the interference, Zhou Wen naturally didn’t know of Starlady Polestar’s plan. However, the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array constantly changed in front of him as beams of starlight fused into his Lunar Mansion Array. Zhou Wen didn’t stand on ceremony as he absorbed them and fully comprehended their profundities.</p>
<p>With limited comprehension, one might indeed go crazy in the end. However, Starlady Polestar had overlooked an important problem.</p>
<p>It couldn’t be said that it was an oversight on her part. It should be said that she didn’t know much about Zhou Wen’s Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art and Singularity Universe.</p>
<p>The Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art itself was a clever Essence Energy Art that could deceive anything. It focused on viewing matters from an overarching manner, and the Singularity Universe simulated the Big Bang—the birth and operation of the universe.</p>
<p>When it came to the grand view of the universe, Zhou Wen’s theoretical knowledge wasn’t necessarily inferior to Starlady Polestar’s.</p>
<p>However, Singularity Universe gave Zhou Wen a large framework. There weren’t many details or content inside—exactly what Zhou Wen lacked.</p>
<p>To determine the framework based on the details and to slowly fill in the content while knowing the framework were two completely different concepts.</p>
<p>The former was truly calculating the infinite with finite limitations. It consumed too much brain power, while the latter was just filling up a framework. The more knowledge he filled up, the more beneficial it was for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>From Starlady Polestar’s point of view, Zhou Wen was inferring from the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions to the Stellar Heavenly Cycle, but in fact, both the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions and the Stellar Heavenly Cycle were within Zhou Wen’s framework.</p>
<p>From a certain point of view, Zhou Wen was actually standing at the same height as Starlady Polestar, so it didn’t produce the situation that Starlady Polestar had imagined.</p>
<p>The changes in the Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array that Starlady Polestar displayed for Zhou Wen were fully absorbed by him. He directly employed it in his system, causing the Lunar Mansion Array to become stronger and more complex.</p>
<p>At that moment, countless stars circled around Zhou Wen as though he was being protected by them. Although they weren’t as dazzling as Starlady Polestar’s, they couldn’t be underestimated.</p>
<p>It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that Zhou Wen’s current technique was the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array.</p>
<p>Starlady Polestar couldn’t help but frown slightly when she saw the array formation around Zhou Wen grow stronger and stronger. The various changes in the Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array were fused into his array formation.</p>
<p>Is this fellow really human? Based on Starlady Polestar’s estimates, even if Zhou Wen had ten heads, he should have exploded from all the changes afforded by the Stellar Heavenly Cycle.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen appeared as though nothing had happened. He continued trying to study her Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array.</p>
<p>The variations in the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array are endless. I want to see how much you can remember. I don’t believe that you have a hundred heads… Even if you really have a hundred heads, there will come a time when they will be filled… Starlady Polestar accelerated the changes in the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array.</p>
<p>However, no matter how the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array changed, Zhou Wen seemed indifferent. He completely merged the changes into his system, found the corresponding spots, and used them for himself.</p>
<p>The antelope was fighting desperately. Many parts of its fur had been shaved off by the starlight, and its body was stained with blood. It looked pathetic.</p>
<p>Not only was Zhou Wen uninjured, but he had also obtained immense benefits. The Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array around him became stronger and stronger. It could even compete with the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array at close distances.</p>
<p>Of course, it only looked more beautiful. The stars surrounded Zhou Wen as though the universe was revolving around him.</p>
<p>In fact, its might was much weaker than the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array. If Starlady Polestar had really used all her strength to kill Zhou Wen, the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array would have long exploded.</p>
<p>However, at that moment, Starlady Polestar still didn’t suppress Zhou Wen with all her might. Instead, she looked at Zhou Wen with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>Although his strength was still very far from hers, the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array around Zhou Wen had already made her waver.</p>
<p>Could it be that this person is really as that antelope said, a rare genius? Starlady Polestar started having different thoughts.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1341'>Chapter 1341: Who Dares to Retain You?</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>The Stellar Heavenly Cycle was infinite. No matter how many changes Zhou Wen could learn, it was only a portion. It could only be called a Minor Heavenly Cycle, but it couldn’t reach a Major Heavenly Cycle like Starlady Polestar.</p>
<p>The true Major Heavenly Cycle was not something that could be mastered through learning, but a realm of comprehension.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was ultimately only at the Mythical stage. Although his realm far exceeded his peers, it wasn’t easy to attain the realm required of the Major Heavenly Cycle.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen quickly realized that although he had learned many variations, they were only accumulations in quantity—there were no qualitative changes.</p>
<p>No matter how many variations my self-taught Minor Heavenly Cycle Array has, it can’t compare to Starlady Polestar’s Major Heavenly Cycle Array. This is a difference in level, not a difference in variation… Zhou Wen thought to himself, pondering over how he could truly reach Starlady Polestar’s level.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen constantly studied and pondered, the antelope couldn’t hold on any longer. The wounds on its body increased, and the spirit talisman above its head couldn’t withstand the starlight’s attacks. It was about to shatter.</p>
<p>“Polestar, don’t force me to go all out. It won’t do anyone any good when the time comes,” shouted the antelope at Starlady Polestar.</p>
<p>“I’m really curious to know how well you have recovered.” Polestar’s expression didn’t change as she spoke calmly.</p>
<p>Seeing that it couldn’t convince Starlady Polestar, the talisman above its head shattered. Swords of starlight rained down like a storm, and the horns on the antelope’s head suddenly lit up. The originally blackish gray horns became like crystal lamps. Not only were they transparent, but they also emitted intense light.</p>
<p>“F*ck you!” the antelope shouted. Before the starlight descended, the lightning from its two shiny horns collided. It was like a collision of lightning, causing a potent spark to erupt and envelop its body.</p>
<p>The terrifying swords of starlight poured down, reducing the area around the antelope to ruins. The ground was peppered with swords of starlight which stacked together like a mountain of sword beams.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>An unbelievable power erupted from the mountain of sword beams, shattering instantly.</p>
<p>A slender figure walked out from the shattered sword mountain. A pure luminance moved with the figure. Even the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array could not suppress the luminance’s power.</p>
<p>Even amidst the starlight, Zhou Wen’s eyes were illuminated by the pure light. He looked at the light and saw a man in a snow-white fur robe walk out.</p>
<p>He wore snow-white clothes and looked handsome. His eyes were like obsidian, deep and bottomless. His long black hair cascaded down over his snow-white fur robe.</p>
<p>The beauty of a person is like jade and the looks of the gentleman are unparalleled.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that this sentence was meant for such a person.</p>
<p>However, when he thought about how this person was very likely transformed from the antelope, such thoughts immediately vanished. He couldn’t connect the two together.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>The lazy antelope, the rogue-like antelope, could actually transform into such a form. It made Zhou Wen find it highly discordant.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>The man walked in the light, and all the swords of starlight that stabbed at him were melted by the pure power of light, as if they were not swords condensed from starlight, but just snowflakes.</p>
<p>With every step the man took, the power of light over his body became stronger. Even the starlight in the sky seemed to pale in comparison.</p>
<p>Polestar was no longer as relaxed as before. Her expression became serious as she stared at the man. The purple gas over her body also bloomed wildly and collided with the man’s light. For a moment, it was difficult to tell who was stronger.</p>
<p>“It seems that you’ve recovered quite well. You can actually return to your human form.” Starlady Polestar stared at the man.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you want to kill me? Let me see if your Polestar Killing Technique can kill me or not.” The man looked straight at the levitating Starlady Polestar. He looked calm, but there seemed to be an indescribable power gathering over his body. It was like an invisible, peerless saber that could be unsheathed at any time and destroy everything.</p>
<p>Starlady Polestar stared at the man. When she saw the man’s stirring aura and how he was about to step out, she suddenly smiled and said, “I was just joking. You told me not to take it seriously, but you took it seriously instead.”</p>
<p>Starlady Polestar swept her cape back and the starlight disappeared. The Forbidden City returned to its original peace.</p>
<p>“It seems that you have mostly recovered from your injuries. Congratulations,” said Starlady Polestar as she looked at the man.</p>
<p>“It’s still far from finished, but it’s enough for me to go all out.” The man stared at Starlady Polestar, but he didn’t restrain his luminance.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly returned to the man who was transformed from the antelope the moment the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array dissipated.</p>
<p>“You and I aren’t enemies. There’s no need to fight to the death. I’m relieved knowing that you can take on your human form again.” As Starlady Polestar spoke, she glanced at Zhou Wen and said, “You helped me return to Forbidden City and helped me seek out a contractor. I still remember this favor. Now that your injuries haven’t healed, it’s best you don’t overexert yourself. It’s best you return early to recuperate. I’ll accept this contractor and I’ll remember this favor.”</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen heard that, he immediately cursed inwardly. This Starlady Polestar is also a scheming b*tch. Seeing that she can’t defeat the antelope, she actually wants to vent her anger on me!</p>
<p>“You didn’t want him when I offered him to you previously. Now that you want him, I’m not giving him to you. Zhou Wen, come with me. Let’s see who dares to retain you.” The antelope snorted coldly and turned to walk towards the entrance of Forbidden City.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he hurriedly followed. He thought that the antelope would abandon him, but he never expected it to transform into a human. Even its personality had become much more unyielding, unlike the beast it used to be.</p>
<p>Starlady Polestar watched Zhou Wen follow the antelope towards the gates with some doubts in his eyes. Her lips moved as though she wanted to say something, but she ultimately didn’t say anything as she watched the two of them leave Forbidden City.</p>
<p>“Ol’ Ante, you’re awesome. I didn’t expect you to be so unyielding today…” After leaving Forbidden City, Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief and patted the antelope’s shoulder.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, the antelope rolled forward like a calabash. As he rolled, he transformed from a human back to an antelope. Its body convulsed as blood kept gushing out of its mouth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed as he reached out to touch the antelope, but before his hand touched it, he felt a heat scald his hand.</p>
<p>The antelope’s body constantly emitted hot steam from its pores. The temperature was much higher than water vapor. It was clear how terrifying the temperature was considering how Zhou Wen could feel the heat despite his physique.</p>
<p>The antelope’s eyes rolled back and its limbs twitched. It looked like it had lost consciousness.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood that the antelope had been putting on a front in Forbidden City. If Polestar had really attacked, both he and the antelope would probably have ended up dead.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly circulated the Ancient Sovereign Sutra and fused with Human Sovereign.. With intense anger, he punched the antelope again and again.</p>
<p>3</p>
<h3 id='chapter1342'>Chapter 1342: An Tianzuo Isn’t the Only One</h3>
<p>Human Sovereign’s power allowed Zhou Wen to use his powerful vitality to heal injuries. Apart from being unable to heal himself, ordinary injuries could be treated.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen’s fist struck the antelope, he felt as though its body was a huge furnace. The moment his vitality entered, it was devoured without a trace.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had never encountered such a situation. The antelope’s condition didn’t show any signs of improvement, but Zhou Wen felt his vitality severely drained. Human Sovereign’s brilliance was becoming weaker and weaker.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to feed the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence and other pills to the antelope before continuing to use the power of Human Sovereign to inject it into its body.</p>
<p>Seeing the pill essences enter the antelope’s mouth like candy, Zhou Wen’s heart ached so much that it was about to bleed. It was fine if it was the other pill essences, but the drop rate of the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence was too low. After grinding Pill Furnace Mountain for so long, he had only obtained one. He also fed the other Mythical pill essences, such as the Vital Dragon Pill, to the antelope.</p>
<p>It was unknown if it was because of the pills or Zhou Wen’s Human Sovereign powers, but the terrifying temperature in the antelope’s body decreased slightly.</p>
<p>Its convulsing body gradually calmed down.</p>
<p>“Stop beating me. With that tiny bit of vitality of yours, it won’t be of much use even if you send it all into my body.” The antelope regained consciousness and struggled to get up from the ground.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s hands were about to break from the punching. The Human Sovereign brilliance over him was almost gone, so he could only stop and decouple with Human Sovereign.</p>
<p>“Are you alright?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Let’s talk when we get back.” The antelope looked around and saw that they were still near Forbidden City.</p>
<p>Although Starlady Polestar was suppressed by the rules of Earth and shouldn’t dare to come out, this couldn’t be confirmed. It was better to stay away.</p>
<p>As the antelope’s injuries were too serious and Zhou Wen was exhausted from expending too much of his vitality, he decided to summon the Earth Elemental Beast and use Earth Escape to travel.</p>
<p>After leaving the capital, the antelope suddenly said to Zhou Wen, “Release Chick.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen released Chick and Ya’er from the chaos space. Chick glanced at the antelope and automatically landed on its head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a careful look and realized that the antelope’s temperature was slowly decreasing. As for Chick, it was in high spirits. Its feathers seemed much brighter.</p>
<p>So Chick can absorb the heat from Antelope. It’s no wonder Antelope likes to bring Chick around. Zhou Wen was enlightened.</p>
<p>“Ol’ Ante, I heard from Starlady Polestar that you have returned to your human form. Could it be that you were a human in the past?” Zhou Wen had questions that he couldn’t help himself from asking.</p>
<p>The antelope said lazily, “Not really.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen couldn’t understand what it meant.</p>
<p>However, the antelope ignored him. It lay on the Earth Elemental Beast’s back as though it was asleep.</p>
<p>Since the antelope wasn’t willing to say anything, Zhou Wen had no choice but to swallow his questions and focus on driving the Earth Elemental Beast.</p>
<p>“Today’s matter is a little strange. It’s impossible for the Spirit Suppression Talisman to fall by itself. Under those circumstances, it’s impossible for Starlady Polestar to break free,” the antelope suddenly said with its eyes closed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded. “I know, but I was paying attention the entire time. I didn’t discover any other creatures nearby.”</p>
<p>The antelope didn’t say anything else and continued to rest with its eyes closed. It was unknown if it had fallen asleep.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen could see it, he would discover a blonde girl standing on the Earth Elemental Beast’s back. Furthermore, she was behind him, less than an arm’s length away.</p>
<p>The golden-haired maiden was naturally Sweetie. She had thought that Starlady Polestar would be able to avenge Yana on her behalf, but who would’ve thought that they would still be able to come out alive?</p>
<p>Looks like I’ll have to avenge Yana myself, the blonde thought, but she didn’t attack immediately.</p>
<p>As the Earth Elemental Beast had been burrowing underground, if Zhou Wen touched her and turned into gold, the Earth Elemental Beast would naturally die as his Companion Beast.</p>
<p>When that happened, Ya’er and the others would be trapped underground. Sweetie was afraid of hurting her.</p>
<p>It won’t be too late to make a move after they return to the surface, Sweetie thought to herself as she continued to stand there and wait.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Ever since Zhou Wen helped Hui Haifeng’s people get on the rankings, many factions had secretly contacted the An family, hoping to get Zhou Wen to help them get on the rankings. They also wanted to figure out what ability Zhou Wen had used to dodge the Calamity-grade bullets.</p>
<p>From their point of view, Zhou Wen was a member of the An family. If they couldn’t contact Zhou Wen, they could contact An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>However, An Tianzuo had no say in Zhou Wen’s matters, nor could he offend all the factions. He could only stall for time, but it also gave An Tianzuo a headache.</p>
<p>“Overseer, the League of Guardians has also sent their men over. Although they didn’t say it explicitly, from what they said, they also want to know how Young Master Wen dodged the Calamity-grade bullets.” An Sheng pushed open the door and saw An Tianzuo leaning back in his chair with his hands massaging his temples.</p>
<p>“Overseer, are you alright?” An Sheng hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“I’m fine.” An Tianzuo lowered his hand and frowned. “That fellow always causes trouble. He always does thankless things without considering the consequences.”</p>
<p>An Sheng explained with a whisper, “Overseer, this isn’t a bad thing. With Young Master Wen’s showcase, the various factions won’t dare touch our Luoyang easily. Even the people from the League of Guardians are polite this time. Their attitude is much better than before.”</p>
<p>“What’s the use of having a good superficial attitude? They yearn to kill him deep down,” An Tianzuo said with a cold snort.</p>
<p>An Sheng thought to himself, If you want to talk about the people the League of Guardians wants to kill, you should be ranked ahead of Young Master Wen. Young Master Wen didn’t do anything to the League of Guardians, but you blew up their Skysplit Tower. Aren’t you still alive and well?</p>
<p>An Sheng naturally didn’t dare say that. He only whispered, “Overseer, you’re right. However, with Young Master Wen’s current strength, even Calamity-grade bullets can’t injure him. They are unlikely to rashly attack Young Master Wen.”</p>
<p>An Tianzuo clearly wasn’t fond of this topic. He didn’t continue the conversation with An Sheng and instead, picked up the document on the table to read it.</p>
<p>“Overseer, we have some clues about the situation in the Holy Land. According to what we know, many Saints like Xiao have appeared from the Holy Land. They are actively contacting the various factions. I wonder what they are up to,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Capture one alive,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“We’ve tried, but we failed. After that saint was captured, he chose to commit suicide. He didn’t give us a chance to question him,” An Sheng said in distress.</p>
<p>“Did you find out how those saints entered and exited the Holy Land?” An Tianzuo asked again.</p>
<p>“We did. They also use teleportation nexuses, but for ordinary humans to enter through them, it’s still the same as before. There’s a level restriction. Even Mythical creatures can’t pass through, much less Terror-grade ones. However, those saints don’t have such restrictions. They can enter and exit from the teleportation array at will,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo pondered for a moment before suddenly looking at An Sheng and asking, “Does anyone else know about the saint’s suicide?”</p>
<p>An Sheng was alarmed when he heard that. “Overseer, don’t tell me you want to disguise yourself as that saint to gain entry into the Holy Land?”</p>
<p>“We can give it a try,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“Absolutely not. It’s too dangerous. Besides, what will happen to Luoyang if you leave?” An Sheng immediately objected.</p>
<p>“An Tianzuo isn’t the only one in Luoyang, right?” An Tianzuo said indifferently.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1343'>Chapter 1343: Fighting Over Chocolate</h3>
<p>“I want to eat this… This… And this…” They passed by a city which was already very far from the capital. Zhou Wen got everyone to take a break and took Ya’er to buy some snacks.</p>
<p>As he had been occupied with numerous matters recently, he hadn’t had much time to accompany Ya’er. He originally thought that his trip to the capital would be relatively easy and that he could take Ya’er on a vacation. Who knew that something like this would happen again?</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen and company exited Earth Escape, Sweetie wanted to attack Zhou Wen, but Ya’er got him to buy her all sorts of snacks.</p>
<p>As Sweetie watched Ya’er eat cotton candy one moment and ice cream the next, she couldn’t help but be stunned.</p>
<p>That… looks delicious… Sweetie couldn’t help but swallow her saliva when she saw Ya’er constantly trying all kinds of delicacies. It seemed like every one of them was delicious.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed behind Ya’er, carrying bags of snacks for her.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, no matter how bad a person is, there are times when they are still alright. Sweetie saw that no matter what Ya’er wanted, Zhou Wen wouldn’t hesitate to buy it for her. She thought to herself, If he dies now, how sad would that young lady be? It’s better to wait for him to finish shopping before ending his sinful life.</p>
<p>“I want that…” Ya’er came to a chocolate shop and pointed at a box of chocolates.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen traced Ya’er’s finger and realized that the box of chocolates was placed in a very obvious spot. Furthermore, there was a special booth. With the lighting, the exquisite chocolate box looked even more eye-catching. It was no wonder Ya’er had taken a fancy to it.</p>
<p>“Please help me get that box of chocolates.” Zhou Wen saw that there was no price tag on the chocolate box and it was obvious that it was very expensive, but that wasn’t important. Money didn’t mean much to Zhou Wen anymore.</p>
<p>“Sir, I’m really sorry. I can’t sell you that box of chocolates for the time being,” the shop assistant said politely.</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement when he heard the store assistant’s words.</p>
<p>The shop assistant explained, “Sir, that box of chocolates was personally made by our boss. It’s also his proudest work. You can call it the centerpiece of our shop. Only one box is made a month. Because it’s so delicious and very popular, many people want to buy it. However, we can only make one box of such chocolates a month. Many people get their friends to get us to sell the chocolates to them. With so many people begging for it, our boss had no choice. He just can’t produce that many. Therefore, our boss made a rule. That box of chocolates can only be sold to the person who knows the most about chocolate.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by knowing the most about chocolate?” Zhou Wen really didn’t understand how one was to determine if someone knew chocolate or not.</p>
<p>When the shop assistant heard Zhou Wen’s words, he knew that he didn’t know anything about chocolate. However, he still said politely, “It’s actually very simple. Every time the chocolate is produced, the boss will set three questions. Those who can answer the three questions correctly are qualified to obtain that box of chocolate for free.</p>
<p>“That’s a pretty good deal. What are the three questions?” Zhou Wen thought to himself, With my ability, I can easily see through things. It shouldn’t be difficult to clear it. I’ll even get that box of chocolates for free.</p>
<p>The shop assistant pointed to the three boxes next to him and said, “There are three different kinds of chocolates in the three boxes. As long as you can determine the specific ingredients of the three chocolates, you can get our store’s centerpiece chocolate.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was taken aback as he was immediately put in a spot.</p>
<p>If he had to guess the brand and type of chocolate in the box, he would be able to guess it even if it was locked in a safe.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had no way of guessing the ingredients in the chocolate. He could see what was inside, but he couldn’t put a name to them.</p>
<p>“Let me try.” Ya’er was very interested in chocolate. She walked over and wanted to reach out for it.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute.” The shop assistant quickly said, “You have to blindfold yourself when eating the chocolate. Moreover, each of these three chocolates is worth three to four hundred bucks. If you eat one, it will be 350. If you eat all three, it works out cheaper—a thousand bucks…”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that it’s free if we can tell the ingredients?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“The store’s centerpiece will be free, but the chocolate used for the test isn’t. Regardless of whether you can tell the ingredients, you have to pay. If you aren’t agreeable to it, you don’t have to make the attempt,” the shop assistant said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen cursed inwardly at the profiteer. Although they claimed that the centerpiece would be given for free, they were actually taking the opportunity to sell ordinary chocolate.</p>
<p>However, it was peanuts to Zhou Wen, so he didn’t care. Just as he was about to pay for Ya’er’s attempt, he suddenly heard a sweet voice behind him say, “I want to give it a try.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found the voice familiar and was alarmed. He turned his head and saw that it was indeed the blonde girl he had met previously.</p>
<p>Previously, the blonde girl had wanted to scam him. Her presence here evoked many thoughts in Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>This place is more than 500 kilometers from the capital. It’s definitely not a coincidence to meet her here. What does she want? Zhou Wen stared at the blonde girl, but he couldn’t see through her. No matter how he looked at her, she looked like an ordinary person who had never cultivated.</p>
<p>Sweetie came prepared. She already knew what money was. She took out a thousand-dollar bill and handed it to the shop assistant.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute. There should be a first-come, first-served rule, right? We came first. If there’s an attempt, we should go first,” Ya’er said.</p>
<p>“You guys only came to the shop first, but you didn’t pay. I paid first, so I naturally get to go first.” Sweetie’s logic was very clear.</p>
<p>In fact, after following Zhou Wen and Ya’er for so long, her appetite was whet. She had swallowed countless mouthfuls of saliva, and when she heard how delicious that box of chocolates was, she couldn’t help but appear, wanting to eat it.</p>
<p>“That’s not right. You’re still serving us. You shouldn’t be taking her money now, right?” Ya’er asked the shop assistant.</p>
<p>The shop assistant was in a dilemma. He felt that what both Sweetie and Ya’er said made sense. They seemed to be right, and he couldn’t find a reason to refute them.</p>
<p>Seeing that neither Sweetie nor Ya’er was willing to budge, the shop assistant coughed and said, “In the past few years, many people have made the attempt every month. However, the chances of them taking our store’s centerpiece is less than one in a hundred. It’s very difficult. Why don’t you try one by one…”</p>
<p>As he spoke, he glanced at Ya’er. Seeing that Ya’er had no intention of backing down, he looked at Sweetie. Sweetie stood there without moving, her eyes equally determined.</p>
<p>The shop assistant could only throw a pleading look at Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen ignored him. All his attention was on Sweetie. I clearly remember that this girl is an existence that can pass through Calamity-grade bullets.</p>
<p>“Since both of you want the centerpiece, let’s have a chocolate competition. Whoever wins will get my centerpiece. Of course, it’s also possible that neither of you will succeed and you’ll end up eliminated. It’s not that easy to get my centerpiece,” someone said as he walked out of a different room.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1344'>Chapter 1344: Gao Dawei</h3>
<p>The person who came out was a large man who was almost as rotund as a ball. He wore a white uniform and a white hat. At first glance, he looked like a chef, but upon closer inspection, there were some differences.</p>
<p>“This is our boss, Mr. Gao Dawei,” the store assistant introduced.</p>
<p>“How should we compete?” Ya’er asked Gao Dawei.</p>
<p>“I’ve recently developed a few types of chocolate. Try them together. Whoever can tell what ingredients I used will win if they guess correctly. If you don’t, you will be eliminated.” When Gao Dawei saw that Sweetie and Ya’er were staring at him, he hurriedly explained, “Don’t worry. The taste test this time is completely free. Whether you win or lose, you don’t have to pay a single cent.”</p>
<p>“That’s more like it. What if both of us are right?” Ya’er asked.</p>
<p>“It’s not that easy. I know the chocolate I made. Even I wouldn’t be able to tell if I hadn’t eaten them in advance,” Gao Dawei said. “Don’t worry, just eat it. I don’t think either of you will be able to get it all right.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Gao Dawei entered the back room and soon brought out a plate of chocolate.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t usually fond of snacks. His impression of chocolate was still those of black squarish bars.</p>
<p>However, the plate of chocolate that Gao Dawei brought out was different from the chocolate in Zhou Wen’s memory.</p>
<p>The chocolate was in the shape of a puppy, a gentleman playing a piano, and a chocolate that seemed to have a layer of snow over it. They looked exquisite.</p>
<p>Ya’er and Sweetie’s gazes were also attracted by the unique-looking chocolate. They looked eager to taste it.</p>
<p>Gao Dawei was very pleased with the three people’s reaction. He said proudly, “For absolute fairness, you have to taste the same kind of chocolate at the same time. Then, write your answer on a piece of paper and give it to me. I’ll be the judge.”</p>
<p>Gao Dawei got the shop assistant to bring paper, pen, and a knife specially used to cut chocolate.</p>
<p>“I call the first chocolate Snowy Mountain. Please try it.” Gao Dawei personally cut two pieces of the snow-covered spherical chocolate and placed them on a small plate before handing them to Ya’er and Sweetie.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that sandwiched within the chocolate was white puffing that flowed out—it seemed to be ice cream.</p>
<p>Ya’er and Sweetie each tasted it. It was delicious. They finished it in a few chomps. Then, the two of them seemed to have an answer. They looked at each other and turned their heads. With their backs facing each other, they found a table and wrote their answers on the paper.</p>
<p>They almost finished writing the answer at the same time and handed them to Gao Dawei.</p>
<p>Gao Dawei took a closer look at their answers and nodded. “Not bad, both of you got it right. Apart from the cocoa and sugar in the chocolate, Snowy Mountain also uses condensed milk, honey, hazelnuts, and ice cream. You even managed to tell the dates that I used in extremely small amounts. Not bad, it seems that your sense of taste is very sensitive. However, don’t get haughty. This is just the simplest and most basic one. Most people can taste it. The ones later are each more difficult than the last. It won’t be that easy to guess.”</p>
<p>Seeing that Ya’er and Sweetie didn’t respond, Gao Dawei had no choice but to cough lightly to ease the awkwardness. He picked another chocolate and said, “This chocolate is called Nature’s Pianist. It’s my latest invention. Try it.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sized up the chocolate curiously. The pianist, bench, and piano formed an exquisite piece of art. It was a pity to eat it.</p>
<p>It was hard to imagine that such exquisite chocolate was made by a rotund man like Gao Dawei.</p>
<p>After the previous round, Zhou Wen had gained a little understanding of chocolate. The suit, bench, and piano were likely made from ordinary chocolate.</p>
<p>The person’s skin and piano’s white keys were likely made from milk.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also knew that it was definitely not that simple. It was impossible for Gao Dawei to pose such a simple problem.</p>
<p>Sniffing, Zhou Wen seemed to detect a familiar smell. He carefully looked at the dark-colored chocolate and immediately made a discovery.</p>
<p>There seems to be something mixed in those dark areas. Zhou Wen only knew that there was something mixed in, but he didn’t know what it was. Although the taste was a little familiar, he couldn’t remember where he had tasted it before.</p>
<p>Ya’er and Sweetie both ate the chocolate that Gao Dawei had cut. Their faces were filled with satisfaction and happiness. One could imagine how delicious this chocolate must be.</p>
<p>This time, Sweetie immediately wrote the answer, but Ya’er hesitated.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t worried that Ya’er would lose. He was just wondering what Sweetie was up to.</p>
<p>Ya’er lowered her head and thought for a while before finally writing down her answer. Meanwhile, Sweetie had already handed the answer to Gao Dawei.</p>
<p>Gao Dawei was surprised by their answers. “Cream and butter taste great, but they can easily mask other flavors. Most people’s taste buds are affected by the taste of chocolate and cream at the same time. Coupled with the rum and the cocoa powder sprinkled over it, it forms a complicated combination, making it difficult to notice the hint of black truffle hidden in it. Most people know that there is no black truffle in black truffle chocolate, but I did the opposite and deliberately added a small amount of black truffle. I didn’t expect you to taste it. What good taste buds you have.”</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen remember that the familiar taste was black truffle. Once, Ouyang Lan had taken him out for a meal, and there were a few flakes of black truffle. Ouyang Lan had specially picked some for Zhou Wen to taste and told him that they were called black truffles.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s mind wasn’t on eating at that time. He was only thinking about how to clear the dungeons when he returned. Therefore, his memory was too vague. Furthermore, he ate very little—just a few thin slices—so he almost couldn’t recall it.</p>
<p>“It won’t be easy for you to guess the next chocolate.” Gao Dawei seemed very confident as he cut open the puppy-shaped chocolate.</p>
<p>He was rather careful when he sliced it, as though he was trying his best to control the cut. Then, he handed the two pieces of chocolate to Ya’er and Sweetie.</p>
<p>Due to their previous two experiences, Ya’er and Sweetie had greater anticipation for the next chocolate. The moment they received it, they couldn’t wait to bite it.</p>
<p>However, after the two of them took two bites, their expressions changed. They chewed slower and slower. Almost at the same time, they spat out the chocolate they had eaten.</p>
<p>“Ya’er, are you alright?” Although Zhou Wen didn’t eat it, he knew that something was wrong with the chocolate when he smelled it. He couldn’t help but stare at Gao Dawei, prepared to attack at any moment.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1345'>Chapter 1345: Snow White</h3>
<p>“Calm down… Calm down… There’s no poison in my chocolate… I just added some stinky tofu…” Gao Dawei immediately waved his hand and explained when he saw Zhou Wen and company’s unfriendly expressions.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sniffed carefully and realized that the stench was really similar to the smell of stinky tofu he had smelled on the streets when he was young.</p>
<p>“Stuffing chocolate with stinky tofu? Are you messing with us?” Zhou Wen’s expression didn’t ease because of Gao Dawei’s explanation.</p>
<p>Gao Dawei shook his head and said with a serious expression, “How is that possible? I’m a professional chocolate chef. I definitely won’t make a mockery of my work. Since the bitterness of cocoa powder can turn into a memorable fragrance, the smell of stinky tofu shares the same principle. I thought about mixing these two extreme flavors together and perhaps creating a new and unique taste…”</p>
<p>Seeing the look in Ya’er and Sweetie’s eyes, Gao Dawei hurriedly said, “Unfortunately, it failed. Combining these two flavors isn’t as easy as I thought. However, this is how experiments are. If you can succeed in one try, it can’t be called an experiment.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw Gao Dawei’s serious expression and realized that he didn’t seem to be lying. Furthermore, there was no need to pull such a prank on them. Besides, it hadn’t been long since they entered the store. It was impossible for Gao Dawei to immediately produce such a thing to mess with them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sniffed it and looked at the puppy-shaped chocolate. He originally found the puppy rather adorable, but now, he found it odd.</p>
<p>Why do I feel like it’s… Zhou Wen didn’t dare think further.</p>
<p>After this development, Ya’er and Sweetie’s expressions didn’t look too good. They looked at the remaining two pieces of chocolate and hesitated about eating them.</p>
<p>Who knew what kind of strange chocolate Gao Dawei would come up with next? The unknown evoked the most terrifying fears.</p>
<p>Even if one could see what was inside the chocolate, one might not know what it was and what taste it would have without eating it. Some subtle components still needed to be distinguished through tasting.</p>
<p>If Gao Dawei were to create some spicy mala chocolates or something even more outrageous, there might be even more terrifying outcomes.</p>
<p>Ya’er and Sweetie wanted to give up, but after looking at each other, they immediately raised their heads. Neither of them was willing to admit defeat.</p>
<p>“Well… Although it tastes awful, you still need to write down what ingredients were used in it so that I can know if you can advance to the next round,” Gao Dawei said carefully.</p>
<p>Ya’er and Sweetie quickly wrote down the answer. Although they only chewed it a few times and spat it out, they still wrote down the ingredients correctly. Apart from the stinky tofu, Gao Dawei had also added durian.</p>
<p>This fellow is really sick. It’s no wonder he said that it’s free from the onset. If he were to take money for this, he would probably be beaten to death. Zhou Wen was rendered speechless. An ordinary chocolate chef would definitely not experiment in such a way unless they had a screw loose.</p>
<p>In the following competition, although Ya’er and Sweetie tried their best not to withdraw and only competed to uphold their pride, they no longer had the anticipation from before.</p>
<p>Eating Gao Dawei’s chocolate felt like they were heading to the execution grounds.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there wasn’t much of a problem with the fourth chocolate. It was a kind of chocolate with alcohol in its center. However, Gao Dawei had used a few special wines to concoct the alcohol. They had to be able to tell which wines were used.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen imagined that Ya’er would not answer correctly this time. Although Ya’er ate a lot of snacks, Zhou Wen never allowed her to drink. Ya’er probably couldn’t even tell the difference between red and white wine. It was indeed impossible for her to tell what wines were inside.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s surprise, not only did Sweetie answer correctly, but Ya’er also answered correctly.</p>
<p>Has Ya’er been drinking behind my back? Furthermore, is she an alcoholic? Otherwise, how would she know the names of the dozens of alcohols that even I haven’t heard of? She can even tell it through taste. How odd! Zhou Wen frowned inwardly.</p>
<p>When it was time for the last piece of chocolate, Gao Dawei perked up. “I didn’t expect your senses to be so sharp. However, it’s impossible for you to taste what the last piece of chocolate is made of. It’s better to give up early.”</p>
<p>“Can we begin?” Ya’er asked expressionlessly.</p>
<p>Ever since she ate the puppy chocolate, she had been nasty to Gao Dawei.</p>
<p>Sweetie was the same. She said impatiently, “Can you hurry up?”</p>
<p>“No rush; we’ll start now.” Gao Dawei pointed at the last piece of chocolate and said, “This is a piece of work that I’ve been particularly proud of recently. It’s called Snow White.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a look and saw that it was made of ordinary white chocolate. However, it was made into the appearance of a woman in a princess dress. Apart from looking good, there was nothing special about it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen directly used his x-ray vision to see the inside of the white chocolate. He realized that it was still white chocolate inside. There was nothing else.</p>
<p>Gao Dawei cut two pieces for Ya’er and Sweetie before asking Zhou Wen, “Do you want to try it? This piece should taste the best of the five chocolates.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen looked at Gao Dawei and nodded slightly.</p>
<p>Gao Dawei cut a piece and handed it to Zhou Wen on a plate. Zhou Wen picked it up and threw it into his mouth, swallowing it in one bite.</p>
<p>“What a waste. You should taste it properly. This taste is unique in this world. Apart from me, no one can produce chocolate with this taste,” Gao Dawei said regretfully.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it just an ordinary white chocolate? What’s so special about it?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“You don’t know anything about chocolate. That piece of chocolate I gave you just now was akin to feeding Pigsy with ginseng fruit. It’s a waste.” Gao Dawei stood up straight and said smugly, “But there’s nothing we can do about it. It’s better than trouble.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen stared at Gao Dawei and asked.</p>
<p>Plop!</p>
<p>Before Gao Dawei could say anything, Sweetie fell to the ground as if she had fainted. Although she was still breathing, she was virtually motionless.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Zhou Wen’s expression changed slightly as he sized up Gao Dawei.</p>
<p>“I’m me, Gao Dawei, a saint of the Sun God Holy Temple. I originally wanted to take a break before going to Luoyang to deal with you guys. I didn’t expect you to come knocking on my door and save me a lot of trouble,” Gao Dawei answered with a smile.</p>
<p>“What’s up with the chocolate?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you? That chocolate is called Snow White. Haven’t you heard of Snow White’s story? After eating my chocolate, you will fall into an eternal sleep.” Gao Dawei smiled and said, “You don’t have to force it. Although your body is much stronger than an ordinary person’s and you can stand for a while longer, you will still fall eventually. Why be in pain?”</p>
<p>“I’m not in any pain.” Zhou Wen outstretched his palm and the chocolate that Gao Dawei had given him was lying in his palm.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1346'>Chapter 1346: Chat After Lying Down</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“What’s it doing there? I clearly saw you eating it!” Gao Dawei’s expression changed slightly.</p>
<p>“What the eyes see might not be the truth,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>Gao Dawei smiled again in the blink of an eye. He pointed at Ya’er and said, “Even if you can remove the chocolate, she ate it…”</p>
<p>Before Gao Dawei could finish his sentence, he saw Zhou Wen outstretch his other hand. There was another piece of chocolate there, the one Ya’er had put in her mouth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was becoming more and more adept at using Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping.</p>
<p>In the past, he could only make a mark before exchanging. Now that he had the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, there was no need to go through so much trouble. As long as it was within the range of the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, Zhou Wen could directly do a swap.</p>
<p>“You… When did you realize that there was something wrong with me?” Gao Dawei immediately knew that he had been exposed. Otherwise, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have taken Ya’er’s chocolate away in advance.</p>
<p>“Not long ago. It was when you offered me Snow White.” Zhou Wen was telling the truth.</p>
<p>Gao Dawei had done everything too naturally without any flaws. In order to lower Zhou Wen and company’s guard, he had even used the smelly chocolate in advance.</p>
<p>If it was an ordinary person, they would write it off as a false alarm. They would have a period when they would let their guard down, making any ploy easier to succeed.</p>
<p>Gao Dawei hadn’t done anything wrong. Everything was fine and natural. However, when he gave Zhou Wen the chocolate in the end, he was too eager for him to accept it.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t show it superficially, he was eager to get Zhou Wen to accept it deep down. Therefore, Zhou Wen heard his thoughts and confirmed that there was something wrong with him.</p>
<p>Of course, even if he didn’t hear his thoughts, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on letting Ya’er eat the last piece of chocolate. Zhou Wen already felt that something was amiss when he saw the stinky chocolate, but he just didn’t have any substantial evidence.</p>
<p>“As expected, I was greedy. I shouldn’t have given you the chocolate. I should have known that you, Zhou Wen, wouldn’t be killed so easily by me,” Gao Dawei said with a sigh.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could say anything else, Gao Dawei suddenly flared up and grabbed the unconscious Sweetie.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen unsheathed his Bamboo Blade and slashed at Gao Dawei’s arm, forcing him to retreat.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s strike wasn’t to save Sweetie, but to save Gao Dawei.</p>
<p>It wasn’t easy to encounter a saint, so Zhou Wen naturally wanted to capture him alive. He hoped to obtain some information. It would be even better if he could obtain information about the former principal.</p>
<p>As for how terrifying Sweetie was, Zhou Wen had seen it with his own eyes. The Calamity-grade bullets that used to surround him had failed to injure her.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t believe that a piece of chocolate from Gao Dawei could take Sweetie down.</p>
<p>He was afraid that Gao Dawei would be killed by her and he would not be able to get anything out of him.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t know that his strike had improved Sweetie’s impression of him. She thought to herself, This person isn’t too bad. He’s good to that young lady and is willing to save me…</p>
<p>Sometimes, being too high-leveled was also a kind of frustration.</p>
<p>It was like an emperor in ancient times: Upon hearing that the victims of a natural disaster did not have rice to eat and had starved to death, he asked them why they didn’t eat meat.</p>
<p>To Sweetie, it was a matter of course, but she didn’t know that she had already exposed her terrifying strength because of those incidents.</p>
<p>Of course, Sweetie was, in fact, even more terrifying than Zhou Wen imagined.</p>
<p>The Bamboo Blade in Zhou Wen’s hand slashed repeatedly, but Gao Dawei’s fat body was shockingly fast. He was like a legendary flying pig. When he rushed into the air, his chef’s uniform had already turned into a chocolate armor that enveloped his body.</p>
<p>The Bamboo Blade struck skyward and slashed toward Gao Dawei again. Gao Dawei surprisingly grabbed the Bamboo Blade with his hands that were wrapped in chocolate.</p>
<p>The moment the Bamboo Blade touched Gao Dawei, the hard blade turned into melted chocolate and dripped to the ground.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen hadn’t retracted his saber fast enough, the entire Bamboo Blade would probably have turned into melted chocolate. Even though he retracted it fast enough, a lot of the chocolate-turned blade had already dripped to the ground, making the Bamboo Blade’s blade turn into a sawtooth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression changed slightly. The Bamboo Blade had been with him for so long, but this was the first time it had been damaged so badly. He had previously used the Bamboo Blade to fight a Terror-grade without it suffering so much damage.</p>
<p>Gao Dawei’s body moved quickly and wherever his body touched, the walls, tables, and chairs would turn into chocolate—melting chocolate.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen put away the Bamboo Blade. It had been with him for so long, so he had some feelings for it. He didn’t want it to be destroyed just like that.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s figure flashed as he dodged Gao Dawei’s repeated attacks. At the same time, he transformed his aura into a sword and used the sword beam to attack Gao Dawei’s vital points.</p>
<p>As he did not dare to touch his body, he could only use sword beam techniques.</p>
<p>Like Xiao, Gao Dawei was at the Terror grade. His movement technique and means were in no way inferior. Furthermore, despite his figure, his movement technique was surprisingly good.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that only saints from the Trajectory Holy Temple were good at movement techniques. He never expected that Gao Dawei, who came from the Sun God Holy Temple, was also good at movement techniques. Furthermore, he had a completely different style from the Trajectory Holy Temple.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used his finger as a sword and brandished his sword aura wantonly, forcing Gao Dawei back.</p>
<p>Gao Dawei wanted to rush out of the shop, but he realized that Zhou Wen’s sword beams seemed random, but they sealed off all his paths of retreat. He couldn’t attack or even escape.</p>
<p>The more Gao Dawei fought, the more discomfort he felt. He felt as if he had been locked up in a cage filled with metal spikes and could not move at all.</p>
<p>“Gao Dawei, I see that you are somewhat different from the other saints. Why don’t we make a deal? Answer a few questions of mine and I’ll ensure your safe departure,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“What do you want to know?” Gao Dawei’s eyes flickered. Clearly, he wanted to stall for time.</p>
<p>“There’s no rush. Let’s chat slowly after you lie down,” Zhou Wen said calmly.</p>
<p>Gao Dawei was first taken aback before he laughed out in anger. “Zhou Wen, you are indeed impressive, but if you think you have me in your grasp, you are sorely mistaken. You can dodge a Calamity-grade bullet, but you might not be able to dodge my strike.”</p>
<p>With that said, Gao Dawei’s body suddenly turned into a coffee-colored liquid like high-temperature chocolate. Like a swamp monster or a liquid demon, he transformed into a tornado that swept towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Clearly, Gao Dawei knew very well that single-target attacks were useless against Zhou Wen. Only AOE attacks could hit him.. As long as Zhou Wen had a drop of chocolate liquid on him, he would turn into chocolate.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1347'>Chapter 1347: Some Clues</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Despite the tornado-like molten chocolate being close at hand, Zhou Wen had no intention of retreating. He used his fingers as a sword and stabbed forward.</p>
<p>Gao Dawei didn’t know why Zhou Wen was stabbing. In his chocolate demon form, he wasn’t afraid of physical attacks. Although the sword beam wasn’t a physical attack, its effects wouldn’t be much different.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, Gao Dawei was alarmed to discover that as Zhou Wen stabbed forward, invisible sword beams appeared around him and they spun at high speeds.</p>
<p>The number of invisible sword beams was uncountable as they enveloped Zhou Wen. When the molten chocolate transformed by Gao Dawei collided with the terrifying vortex of sword beams, the molten chocolate tornado was sucked in by the sword beam tornado.</p>
<p>The invisible sword beam tornado seemed to be quickly dyed with a layer of chocolate. Gao Dawei wanted to escape from the sword beam tornado, but he realized that he couldn’t.</p>
<p>There was an extremely strong suction force in the vortex. No matter how he struggled, he was still firmly sucked into it. Furthermore, countless sword beams spun and diced the molten chocolate into smaller blobs.</p>
<p>Gao Dawei was shocked. Although chocolate demons were unafraid of physical attacks, there was a limit. If the molten chocolate could not even maintain its most fundamental particle state, he would equally die.</p>
<p>Ordinary Terror-grade creatures shouldn’t have such an overwhelming advantage. Ordinary slicing attacks posed little threat to a chocolate demon. Even if a portion of the chocolate could be reduced to its fundamental particle form, it wouldn’t have much of an effect on the overall situation.</p>
<p>A chocolate demon’s true nemesis was the power of ice. Zhou Wen clearly wasn’t proficient in ice, so Gao Dawei wasn’t too worried.</p>
<p>However, he suddenly realized that the invisible sword beams around Zhou Wen were just too terrifying. They kept slicing the molten chocolate, quickly reducing them to their fundamental particles.</p>
<p>Gao Dawei had never seen such abnormal sword beams before. How could he know that Zhou Wen wasn’t purely using sword beams? It was the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array. The sword beams were only the foundation for forming the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was considered to be blessed by the heavens. The Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array was very powerful, but it also needed sufficient stellar power or sword energy to form its foundation. The stronger the foundation, the stronger the array formation.</p>
<p>If it were an ordinary person, even if they were at the Terror grade, the Essence Energy they had was limited. It was impossible for them to condense that much sword energy to form the foundation in a short period of time. Or perhaps it was because their Essence Energy was too scattered and the sword energy they condensed was too weak. It would definitely greatly weaken the strength of the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy was nearly infinite. Every sword beam from the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array could match a full-powered strike of the same level. The sword array formed was enough to crush a peer at the same level.</p>
<p>Although the chocolate demon was very strong, it could only be crushed when facing thousands of Terror-grade sword beams.</p>
<p>“No… that’s impossible… ah…” Gao Dawei was horrified to discover that the molten chocolate form he was in had already begun to vaporize under the attack of the sword beams.</p>
<p>“Stop… what questions do you have… I’ll tell you everything… Ah…” Gao Dawei screamed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s finger froze as an invisible sword beam that resembled a tornado stood fixed in the air like a star in the night sky.</p>
<p>Only then did Gao Dawei fall to the ground and return to his human form. However, the chocolate armor on his body had shattered in many places. Gao Dawei himself was covered in wounds and bleeding profusely.</p>
<p>Around Gao Dawei’s body, countless sword beams surrounded him like a spherical prison. The tips of the swords were aimed at his body.</p>
<p>“I’m a very impatient person, so it’s best you cherish this opportunity. Don’t give me an answer that displeases me. You only have one chance.” Zhou Wen paused before immediately asking, “Do you know someone named Xiao?”</p>
<p>“I know of this person, but I’m not familiar with him. I only know that he’s a Saint of the Trajectory Holy Temple,” Gao Dawei said.</p>
<p>“How many Saints like Xiao are there in the Trajectory Holy Temple?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I’m from the Sun God Holy Temple. I don’t know much about the Trajectory Holy Temple. From what I know, there are 13 to 14 Saints there,” Gao Dawei answered without hesitation.</p>
<p>“Where did those Saints come from?” Zhou Wen continued asking.</p>
<p>Gao Dawei hesitated and did not answer immediately.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Gao Dawei let out a miserable scream as one of his arms was chopped off. In an instant, a bloody mist bloomed thanks to the invisible sword beams before it was vaporized.</p>
<p>“Orphanage! We all came from the orphanage!” Gao Dawei yelled.</p>
<p>“It’ll be your head next.” Zhou Wen continued coldly, “Which orphanage?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know where it is. I was too young at that time. I only know that it was an orphanage built in a valley. There were many orphans there. I have seen many of the Saints I know back in the orphanage. However, the orphanage is also divided into several different districts. They are separated from each other. I don’t know Xiao. Maybe he is an orphan from another district, or maybe he is younger and came later than me. But I can be sure that he came from the orphanage as well.” Gao Dawei did not dare to hesitate and finished his answer in one breath.</p>
<p>“Oh, since you’ve never seen him, how can you be sure that he came from the orphanage?” Zhou Wen looked at Gao Dawei with interest.</p>
<p>“That’s hard to explain. People from the orphanage have a special air about them. Others can’t tell, but I can tell at a glance.”</p>
<p>“Can the air be seen?” Zhou Wen snorted coldly.</p>
<p>Gao Dawei hurriedly explained, “I didn’t make myself clear. Air is just a metaphor. It means that everyone who comes out of the orphanage has a special… how should I describe it…”</p>
<p>“Bearing?” Zhou Wen finished his sentence.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s bearing. It’s that kind of air that they exude. It’s just like how soldiers have the air of soldiers. Even if they’re wearing home clothes, you can tell at a glance that they have been in the military. The people from the orphanage have a special air. Ordinary people can’t feel it, but I can. They’re the same kind,” Gao Dawei explained.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, From the looks of it, it’s very likely. These Saints are most likely orphans nurtured by Dugu Qianqiu.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen asked, “Which Holy Temple is Professor Ouyang in?”</p>
<p>“Which Professor Ouyang?” Gao Dawei was stunned.</p>
<p>“How many Professor Ouyangs are there in your Holy Land?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Two or three,” Gao Dawei answered after some thought.</p>
<p>“Then brief me on all of them.” Zhou Wen was delighted.. After investigating for so long, he was finally close to the truth.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1348'>Chapter 1348: An Tianzuo Has Left</h3>
<p>“Then let’s start with Professor Ouyang Ting…” Gao Dawei’s words immediately attracted Zhou Wen’s attention as his pupils subconsciously constricted.</p>
<p>As Gao Dawei spoke, he lowered his head as though he was thinking. When Zhou Wen focused and listened, he suddenly saw Gao Dawei’s figure transform into his molten chocolate form again. Then, he seeped into the ground like water.</p>
<p>In an instant, the chocolate demon crawled out of the ground again. However, the spot where he crawled out was where Zhou Wen was standing. The molten chocolate instantly enveloped Zhou Wen’s shoes and legs and quickly spread upwards. Zhou Wen’s shoes and clothes had already turned into chocolate as it constantly dripped.</p>
<p>“You’re still too inexperienced to fight me!” The chocolate enveloped most of Zhou Wen’s body as Gao Dawei’s smug laughter sounded from the boiling molten chocolate.</p>
<p>“Is that so?” Zhou Wen’s indifferent voice suddenly sounded, causing Gao Dawei’s smug laughter to stop.</p>
<p>In the next second, the chocolate wrapped around Zhou Wen’s body gathered in his hand like dust absorbed by a vacuum cleaner and instantly vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>Pa!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s fingers moved slightly as he closed the exquisite candy box in his hand. It was Sweetie’s candy box that had sucked away Gao Dawei.</p>
<p>Previously, Zhou Wen had spent considerable time studying the candy box and realized that it was a spatial item. However, this spatial item could only store sweets like candy. Apart from that, nothing else could be placed inside.</p>
<p>Later, when Zhou Wen learned spatial skills, he wondered if he could modify the candy box. If he could modify it into something that could store anything, he would have another spatial artifact.</p>
<p>He studied the candy box, but the outcome wasn’t satisfactory. He didn’t know what method the person who created the candy box had employed, but no matter what spatial skill Zhou Wen used, it couldn’t affect its candy-only characteristic.</p>
<p>At most, it could suck in candy from the outside world. Other than that, there was nothing special.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that the candy box was useless, but when he saw Gao Dawei’s chocolate demon state, he recalled the candy box.</p>
<p>Killing a person like Gao Dawei wouldn’t affect the Holy Land much, but if he could dig out more secrets of the Holy Land from him, it would be of great help to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen had always wanted to keep Gao Dawei alive and not kill him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had long expected Gao Dawei’s sudden attack, thus he took the opportunity to suck him into the candy box. After all, the candy box could only suck in candy after coming into contact with it. It couldn’t suck candy from a distance.</p>
<p>After putting away Gao Dawei and closing the candy box, Zhou Wen turned to look at Sweetie on the ground.</p>
<p>Sweetie had been pretending to be unconscious, but she was alarmed when she saw Zhou Wen take out the candy box.</p>
<p>The candy box had been lost the last time she came to Earth. No matter how she searched, she couldn’t find it. She never expected it to be in Zhou Wen’s hands.</p>
<p>He shouldn’t have been born back when I came to Earth. It can’t be that he stole it. Then, where did he get the candy box? Sweetie felt that it was imperative that she figured out the problem, so she decided to delay Zhou Wen’s punishment. She wanted to figure out the origins of the candy box first.</p>
<p>When he saves me later, I can take the opportunity to approach him and figure out where he got the candy box from. However, if he tries to save me, he will touch my body and immediately turn into gold… But if I don’t let him touch me, how can I get close to him? Sweetie was in a dilemma as countless thoughts flashed through her mind. She was thinking of how she could prevent Zhou Wen from touching her when he came to help her and use the opportunity to approach him.</p>
<p>He’s here… What should I do… He’s coming… Should I wake up on my own… Sweetie sensed Zhou Wen looking over and immediately became nervous. She still couldn’t think of a way to wake up naturally and approach Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, what happened next stunned Sweetie. Zhou Wen turned around and picked up Ya’er, who was beside her. He turned around and instant transmitted away.</p>
<p>He’s definitely a scumbag… baddie… He needs to be punished… Sweetie got up from the ground and looked in the direction Zhou Wen had left. Her eyes were about to spew fire.</p>
<p>If not for wanting to figure out where the candy box came from, she would have gone up to touch Zhou Wen and turn him into gold.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took Ya’er to find the antelope and Chick who were resting. He told them about his encounter with Sweetie. The antelope also concurred that Sweetie wasn’t simple and suggested that Zhou Wen escape immediately.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had the same thought. He took the antelope and Chick with him and didn’t immediately return to Luoyang. Instead, he went to several places, hoping to shake off Sweetie.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and the antelope remained on high alert the entire time, but they heaved a sigh of relief when they didn’t discover Sweetie chasing after them.</p>
<p>Little did they know that Sweetie had been following Zhou Wen all this while. At that moment, she was sitting on the Earth Elemental Beast’s back, just inches from Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, none of them could see Sweetie. They used all sorts of methods to scan their surroundings, but they did not detect her. They imagined that she had not followed them.</p>
<p>After rushing back to Luoyang, Zhou Wen felt physically and mentally exhausted. He originally imagined that he would be able to reap some benefits from this trip, but to his surprise, not only did he fail to reap any benefits, he was nearly killed by Starlady Polestar. He had also provoked a blonde girl who had appeared out of nowhere.</p>
<p>“I don’t plan on going out for the time being. Don’t invite me on your trips to places like dimensional zones,” Zhou Wen said to the antelope.</p>
<p>“Would I still dare to invite you? When did nothing happen when I’m out with you? I almost lost my life this time. Do you think I’ll invite you again?” the antelope said angrily.</p>
<p>“Ahem, it was purely an accident. Get some rest. Let me know if you need anything. I’ll head back now.” Zhou Wen hurriedly left the antelope’s room. He really had no answer to the problem.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen left the room, he saw An Sheng standing not far away, as though he was waiting for him.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, do you have time to chat?” An Sheng came over and asked.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen saw that An Sheng’s expression wasn’t right.</p>
<p>An Sheng nodded. “Let’s talk in Overseer’s study. It’s not convenient to talk here.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to go there, right?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Overseer isn’t around,” An Sheng said meaningfully.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. The meaning behind An Sheng’s statement that the Overseer wasn’t around was somewhat subtle. Zhou Wen knew that something had definitely happened, so he didn’t say anything else and followed An Sheng to An Tianzuo’s study.</p>
<p>This was where An Tianzuo usually worked. There were many special contraptions. Be it using Essence Energy Skills or high-tech methods, it wasn’t easy to eavesdrop on the people inside.</p>
<p>“Overseer has left Luoyang. It might be some time before he returns. Overseer hopes that you’ll take charge of the Overseer Manor while he’s away,” An Sheng said.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1349'>Chapter 1349: Astonishing Price</h3>
<p>“How can the Overseer not preside over the Overseer Manor? Why does he keep running about elsewhere?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>He had no interest in taking charge of Luoyang. Even if An Tianzuo really wanted him to be the Overseer and give him Luoyang, Zhou Wen would find it troublesome. Furthermore, Zhou Wen was really unwilling to help him guard Luoyang.</p>
<p>An Sheng said with a solemn expression, “Overseer has entered the Holy Land.”</p>
<p>Alarmed, Zhou Wen hurriedly asked, “Entered the Holy Land? Isn’t he already at the Terror grade? How did he enter the Holy Land?”</p>
<p>“Madam Lan is still brooding over the professor’s death. She hasn’t had a good night’s sleep in recent years. Overseer can’t bear to see Madam Lan continue like this. There’s no other way, so he plans on pretending to be a Saint and entering the Holy Land to take a look. He hopes to figure out something.” An Sheng told Zhou Wen what had happened.</p>
<p>“Even if he can take on a Saint’s appearance, his body is still his. He won’t be able to enter the Holy Land. What’s the use of impersonating?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about that. Overseer’s impersonation as a Saint isn’t only limited to looks. We also used some special means. Overseer has successfully entered the Holy Land. During this period of time, we hope that you can help guard Luoyang. Actually, just like last time, you can leave the trivial matters to us subordinates. It won’t take up too much of your time,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen agreed.</p>
<p>Since An Tianzuo had taken the risk to investigate the former principal’s matters, it was only right for him to guard Luoyang. Furthermore, his family and friends were here.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, do you think we should settle the urgent matters first?” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“What urgent matters? Could it be that someone has come knocking on our door?” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be taken aback. The last time he guarded Luoyang, nothing urgent had happened.</p>
<p>“Not really, but the representatives sent by the various factions wish to meet you. They also wish to hire you to help them get into the rankings. Of course, many people want to know how you dodged the Calamity-grade bullets. After all, such an ability is so shocking.” An Sheng explained the matter.</p>
<p>Previously, An Tianzuo had held them back. Now that An Tianzuo was gone, Zhou Wen could only deal with these matters himself.</p>
<p>“How will I have the time to help them get on the rankings? Get them to leave,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Ahem, Young Master Wen, I’m afraid that’s not appropriate, right?” An Sheng stammered.</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen asked An Sheng.</p>
<p>“When they came, they brought huge gifts. Even if you aren’t willing to see them, it won’t be good to just send them back,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“What did you receive? I should have a share, right?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>An Sheng seemed to be prepared as he took out a list for Zhou Wen to see.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but widen his eyes when he saw this. From the list, the gifts weren’t trivial. People knew that the An family needed Essence Crystals, so they basically gifted them tons.</p>
<p>Of course, one to two tons of Essence Crystals would not be especially helpful to the An Family either. But with so many people gifting, it was quite a sizable amount.</p>
<p>“You sold me off for just these Essence Crystals?” Zhou Wen said unhappily.</p>
<p>“It’s not just for these few Essence Crystals. It’s mainly because even the six families have sent people over. If we offend all of them, the An family’s days in the future won’t be easy. You also know what kind of environment Earth is in now. The things that Luoyang can produce are very limited. Many things have to be purchased from other places. For example, the most commonly used toilet paper can’t be manufactured in Luoyang now. It can only be imported. Salt is another one. If we offend all of them, we won’t die, but life will be very troublesome in all aspects…”</p>
<p>After saying that, An Sheng took out another piece of paper and handed it to Zhou Wen. “Also, this is the price they offered. I think you should take a look even if you want to refuse their requests.”</p>
<p>“What price can they offer? They can’t offer me a Terror-grade Companion Egg, right?” When Zhou Wen took the piece of paper and read it, his eyes nearly popped out.</p>
<p>“Is this for real?” Zhou Wen asked An Sheng as he read.</p>
<p>The high price offered exceeded Zhou Wen’s expectations.</p>
<p>A tycoon had offered a sky-high price of 1,000 tonnes of Essence Crystals just to get Zhou Wen to help him get on the rankings.</p>
<p>There was also the Zhang family of the six major families who offered ten Vital Dragon Pills, a thousand Rejuvenation Pills, and a Fate Reversing Talisman.</p>
<p>Although there were no Terror-grade Companion Eggs, their combined value wasn’t inferior to a Terror-grade Companion Egg.</p>
<p>The Vital Dragon Pill and Life Recovery Pill were both Mythical pill essences. The healing effects were very good. Although the Rejuvenation Pill’s level was low, it was very good for treating external injuries.</p>
<p>The most precious thing was the Fate Reversal Talisman. It was said that it could change one’s fate.</p>
<p>Of course, changing one’s fate was only an exaggeration. However, if a person who was destined to lose every round when gambling used a Fate Reversal Talisman before going to a casino, then they would be able to win every single time. This type of effect was amazing.</p>
<p>Previously, Liu Yun was able to steal the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General because of the effects of the Fate Defying Talisman.</p>
<p>It was said that they were all left behind by the Zhang family’s ancestral Celestial Master. Now, no one knew how to make them. There were only a few left in the Zhang family.</p>
<p>The prices offered by the other families and local wealthy families were also ridiculously high. There were indeed families that obtained Terror-grade Companion Eggs—the Family Clan of Gods in the West District.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen helped them get on the rankings, he would immediately become rich.</p>
<p>“Of course it’s real. As long as you give the nod, they are even willing to pay first,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Don’t they know that it’s useless to be on the rankings? Only by being first can they become the final winner?” Zhou Wen asked An Sheng in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Of course they do. However, their goal isn’t to obtain a Venusian Companion Beast. Firstly, even if they can’t obtain a Venusian Companion Beast, the metal eggs they obtain after clearing the level will be able to hatch a Companion Beast in the future. It’s just that their level will definitely be lower than a Venusian Companion Beast. We don’t know what it would be when hatched. It won’t be a loss if they get a Terror-grade Companion Beast. Even if they don’t get one, it won’t be a loss. They want the fame of being on the rankings,” An Sheng explained.</p>
<p>“What’s the use of fame?” Zhou Wen didn’t understand. Without strength, what was the use of fame?</p>
<p>“It’s very useful. Do you know what we lack the most now?” An Sheng asked.</p>
<p>“High-level Companion Beasts?” Zhou Wen guessed casually.</p>
<p>“No, what we lack the most now is people,” An Sheng explained. “It’s not just us. All the major factions are lacking people. As the dimensional zones’ restrictions are becoming more and more severe, the isolation in various places is becoming more and more serious. In addition, there are constantly people sacrificing themselves. For example, our Luoyang is already considered good, but the population growth has always been negative. If this continues, the number of people in Luoyang will only decrease. The city will undergo a depression, and the economy will decline. All industries will find it difficult to survive. When the time comes, we will probably have to fight dimensional creatures together because there’s nothing else that can be done. Then, the number of people fighting will only decrease. After all, it’s a life-and-death struggle. No one can guarantee that there won’t be any accidents.</p>
<p>“Although we have already started to formulate policies to encourage childbirth, the effects take a while to show. We will only see the initial results after at least ten years. The fastest way is to attract people from other smaller places. For example, our Luoyang is quite famous, and there are many people who come because of its reputation. For other places, it is not so easy to attract people. However, if they are able to enter the rankings, no matter how you get there, at least the people nearby will know that there is a place that has the ability to hire someone formidable like you. Once they consider moving over, they will have naturally chosen that place.”</p>
<p>An Sheng smiled and continued, “Of course, they have other considerations. For example, the six families have their own ideas. I can’t guess what they are.”</p>
<p>“Then do you think I should take on these jobs?” Zhou Wen asked An Sheng.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1350'>Chapter 1350: Breaking into the Rankings Again</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“You have the final say in Luoyang now. You are the king of Luoyang. If you want to accept it, accept it. If you don’t want to, just let them wait. If anyone dares to fall out with you, just beat them up and chase them away,” An Sheng said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pondered for a moment. “Then I won’t accept it. Prepare yourself. Pick someone to follow me to the Venusian dimensional zone. Let’s get a ranking first.”</p>
<p>“What are your requirements?” An Sheng asked solemnly.</p>
<p>“As long as they run fast,” Zhou Wen said after some thought. As long as they ran fast and saved some time, he could also lower the number of Calamity-grade bullets circling him.</p>
<p>Without a suitable target, even with Calamity-grade bullets, it wasn’t easy to kill a Calamity-grade. Zhou Wen planned on returning the Invincible Lucky Star to Wang Lu after this.</p>
<p>In the future, even if he wanted to rush to the top of the rankings, he would have to rely on his own abilities. After all, Lucky Dodge was not a long-term solution.</p>
<p>Recently, Zhou Wen had a new idea when studying spatial skills. He felt that he might have a chance of dealing with a Calamity-grade bullet.</p>
<p>Although he had used Spacetime Bandit and Absolute Space, he was still unable to form an infinitely looping space. Moreover, he was unable to completely fuse it with the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping technique. He kept feeling like something was missing.</p>
<p>However, after learning the Minor Heavenly Stellar Array, Zhou Wen had a new idea.</p>
<p>If it was not possible to simply cast a skill, then he could use an array to achieve the behavior of an infinitely looping space. By combining the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array and Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping, he might be able to achieve the method of producing infinite space.</p>
<p>However, this required a lot of time for experimentation and modification; it was not something that could succeed quickly.</p>
<p>“Then do you think Miss Jing is up to it?” An Sheng asked.</p>
<p>“Anyone is fine.” Zhou Wen didn’t feel anything special about An Jing. It made no difference to him whether it was An Jing or someone else from the Sunset Army.</p>
<p>“Then let’s have Miss Jing do it. Her speed is considered extremely fast among the Mythical grade,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen recalled something and asked An Sheng, “How did An Jing advance to the Mythical stage?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen still remembered that An Jing had previously contracted a Guardian, but he had killed the Guardian she had contracted with. Ever since then, Zhou Wen hadn’t paid much attention to An Jing.</p>
<p>After returning five years later, he learned that An Jing had advanced to the Mythical stage. Furthermore, she had been pretending to be Zhou Wen for five years.</p>
<p>An Sheng hesitated for a moment before saying, “Actually, it’s hard to say. Miss Jing relied on her own hard work to advance to the Mythical stage. There’s also another thing…”</p>
<p>After a long pause, An Sheng whispered, “Holy Land.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at An Sheng in surprise, hoping that An Sheng could explain himself. There were too many possibilities with what he had just said, so Zhou Wen couldn’t guess.</p>
<p>“In short, it’s not easy for me to say anything about this. It’s better to let Miss Jing tell you herself when there’s an opportunity in the future. Just feign ignorance and don’t mention this in front of her,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Alright, make the preparations. We’ll head to Venus tomorrow morning.” Zhou Wen originally didn’t plan on having much interaction with An Jing. He was just curious.</p>
<p>An Jing’s advancement to the Mythical stage was actually related to the Holy Land. This implied something subtle.</p>
<p>An Sheng informed An Jing that Zhou Wen was going to Venus to obtain a ranking. An Jing was slightly taken aback when she heard that. “Is he taking me along?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. After all, we’re family. Of course, we have to keep such benefits for ourselves,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Why doesn’t he get the rankings himself?” An Jing frowned.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen doesn’t plan on getting on the rankings yet. He’s only helping Luoyang get a ranking,” An Sheng explained.</p>
<p>“What do I need to prepare?” An Jing asked again.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen said that after dealing with the six Golden Battle Gods, you have to reach the Golden Palace as quickly as possible. The faster you reach the Golden Palace, the less pressure he will suffer.” An Sheng naturally wouldn’t tell An Jing that Zhou Wen wanted speed to save him some time.</p>
<p>“Got it.” An Jing nodded.</p>
<p>The next morning, Zhou Wen, An Sheng, and An Jing arrived in front of the Cube.</p>
<p>An Jing stood behind and looked at Zhou Wen with mixed feelings. Over the past few years, she had been using Zhou Wen as her goal to improve herself. She hoped that one day, she could surpass Zhou Wen and use her actions to tell everyone that she wasn’t inferior to him.</p>
<p>However, not only did the disparity between the two of them not decrease, it had instead increased.</p>
<p>She hadn’t advanced to the Terror grade, but Zhou Wen was already able to participate in a Calamity-grade battle. The difference wasn’t small.</p>
<p>However, An Jing didn’t have any thoughts of giving up. Previously, she had been at the Legendary stage while Zhou Wen was at the Mortal stage. Zhou Wen had been able to catch up from behind. Her current situation was very similar to the former Zhou Wen’s.</p>
<p>An Jing believed that since Zhou Wen could do it, as long as she worked hard, she would definitely be rewarded.</p>
<p>After all, the higher one went, the slower the advancement. When Zhou Wen stopped advancing, she still had a chance of catching up, and she believed that she had the ability to do so.</p>
<p>“Activate the Cube,” Zhou Wen said to An Jing.</p>
<p>An Jing’s body naturally reacted. She listened to Zhou Wen’s orders and walked towards the Cube.</p>
<p>After An Jing came to a realization of what she had done, she couldn’t help but be taken aback. This was because she had subconsciously listened to Zhou Wen’s orders as though it was a matter of course. Such a reaction shouldn’t have happened to her.</p>
<p>This was because she was a maverick. There was only one person who could make her carry out orders without thinking—An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>Even Ouyang Lan’s words had to be thought through by An Jing before she decided if she complied.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, her relationship with Zhou Wen wasn’t good, and she viewed him as an opponent. It was impossible for such a situation to happen.</p>
<p>After walking up to the Cube, An Jing turned her head to look at Zhou Wen who was standing on it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood there casually without any powerful aura, but he made people feel abnormally at ease. It was as though even if the sky collapsed, it wasn’t a big deal as long as he stood there.</p>
<p>An Jing had only felt such a feeling from An Tianzuo in the past, but now, she felt it from Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>In a daze, An Jing looked at Zhou Wen as though she was looking at An Tianzuo; it was a rather strange feeling.</p>
<p>“Drip some blood in,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>An Jing snapped to her senses as she lowered her head and dripped a drop of blood into the entrance of the Cube.</p>
<p>The Cube instantly shone with brilliant light. All of the Cubes in the world activated simultaneously.</p>
<p>“Another creature has entered the Venusian dimensional zone… Who is it? Could it be a human?”</p>
<p>“Damn, why is it him again? He even brought a beauty with him this time. Who is that beauty?”</p>
<p>“The An family’s An Jing. She’s said to be very talented and is in no way inferior to An Tianzuo. In a few years, she might become another An Tianzuo.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if she will become another An Tianzuo, but that Zhou Wen is too much. Don’t tell me he wants to lead someone onto the rankings again?”</p>
<p>“Only An Jing is following. Looks like it.”</p>
<p>“This person… can only be described with two words… utterly outrageous…”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Amidst everyone’s discussion, Zhou Wen and An Jing entered the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>It was like a replay of what happened previously.. Zhou Wen dealt with the Metal Guards and the Golden Battle Gods as he entered the corridor.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1351'>Chapter 1351: Give It to Them If They Want It</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>The Calamity-grade bullet sounded as Zhou Wen dodged it without any suspense.</p>
<p>Just like last time, none of the bullets could touch Zhou Wen’s body. The seventh sure-kill bullet could only fly around him.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen dodged the first round of bullets, An Jing didn’t immediately rush out.</p>
<p>An ancient bow appeared in her hand as she aimed at one of the doors. The arrow that shot out was actually connected to a thin thread. The other end of the thread was in An Jing’s hand.</p>
<p>After the arrow flew out, it immediately pulled An Jing’s body out as she instantly disappeared through the door.</p>
<p>The arrow’s speed had almost reached the limits of the Mythical stage. It was even close to the Terror grade.</p>
<p>What was even stranger was that the arrow could actually turn by itself. It flew through the maze-like passage like lightning, but it did not touch any walls.</p>
<p>Only one sure-kill bullet appeared around Zhou Wen. Just as the second round’s sure-kill bullet was about to be fired, An Jing had already arrived in front of the Golden Palace.</p>
<p>Landing in front of the Golden Palace, An Jing exerted force with her fingers and the bow returned to her hand.</p>
<p>The Golden Palace’s door opened as a metal ball flew out and landed in An Jing’s hand.</p>
<p>The scene switched back to the rankings. The name of ‘Sunset Army’ appeared on the rankings. Just like the Federation Suicide Squad, it had three stars.</p>
<p>However, despite having the same three stars, the Sunset Army was actually ranked ahead of the Federation Suicide Squad.</p>
<p>It was obvious that the Cube’s main evaluation criterion was still Zhou Wen. However, An Jing’s performance also played a significant supporting role. Therefore, they were awarded three stars overall, but their ranking was ahead of the Federation Suicide Squad.</p>
<p>Ordinary people weren’t in the mood to care about this. They only felt that Zhou Wen had crossed the line; he was even worse than Deceit King.</p>
<p>At least Deceit King put in some effort to snatch the loot.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen only needed to take one trip to reach the rankings. Not only did he obtain a Venusian Companion Egg, but he could also receive a private carry fee. It was like doing a zero capital business to the extreme.</p>
<p>When the various factions saw Zhou Wen pull off this stunt, they were envious and depressed.</p>
<p>“Investigate. We have to investigate how Zhou Wen dodged the Calamity-grade bullet. It must be a special Companion Beast’s ability.” An old woman from the Cape family stared at the screen and repeatedly watched the video of Zhou Wen dodging the Calamity-grade bullet.</p>
<p>“We have to figure out what Companion Beast Zhou Wen’s clothes are.” A similar order sounded in the Family Clan of Gods.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the six families. Even the League of Guardians was studying what Companion Beasts Zhou Wen had on him to achieve such an effect.</p>
<p>They could tell that Zhou Wen’s ability was definitely related to the clothes. However, no one knew what kind of Companion Beast the clothes were.</p>
<p>Few people had been to Netherworld City, and even fewer could enter the Six Realms. Apart from Zhou Wen and company, only Xiao and the other two Saints had entered. However, they had not entered the Devas Realm and had not obtained the Heavenly Robe.</p>
<p>After this battle, Luoyang became even more chaotic. All kinds of methods, both done in the open and in the dark, kept Overseer Manor busy.</p>
<p>Thankfully, An Tianzuo had already done a purge before he left. It wasn’t easy to find new spies to infiltrate the Overseer Manor. Most people could only think of solutions from the periphery.</p>
<p>“How many has it been today?” Zhou Wen asked as he looked at the intruder he had just captured.</p>
<p>“It’s the eleventh one. From the looks of it, they are determined. No matter what, they have to figure out your mojo, Young Master,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“It appears we need to have a solution. Otherwise, trouble will keep coming,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“If it’s Overseer, he will teach them a lesson they will remember and make them not dare to be so brazen,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, I’m not An Tianzuo. How about this? Spread the word that I want to sell the Heavenly Robe Companion Beast that can dodge the Calamity-grade bullets,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“Are you really selling it?” An Sheng was somewhat surprised. After all, with such a Companion Beast in hand, no one would be willing to sell it. The benefits involved were too great.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Since they want it so much, I’ll give it to them. I don’t want them to keep bothering me.” Zhou Wen smiled and continued, “However, I still need you to do this. You have to make them beg to buy it. You can’t drop the price.”</p>
<p>An Sheng understood and asked softly, “Young Master Wen, is there something wrong with the Heavenly Robe?”</p>
<p>“Would I sell it to them if there was no problem?” Zhou Wen told An Sheng that the Heavenly Robe needed to synergize with a Luck Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“Although Luck Companion Beasts are very rare, those large factions can still obtain some… What if…” An Sheng was somewhat worried.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. They definitely won’t be able to gather Luck Companion Beasts that allow a 100% evasion rate.” Zhou Wen knew very well that without Wang Lu’s Invincible Lucky Star, there was no 100% chance. It was useless even if one obtained more ordinary Lucky Companion Beasts. No matter how high the chance was, it wasn’t 100%.</p>
<p>One had to use the Invincible Lucky Star’s Life Providence, Life Soul, Wheel of Destiny, and Terror transformation to achieve a 100% evasion rate.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had tried it in-game. If he didn’t activate its Terror transformation, or if he didn’t use its Life Soul or Wheel of Destiny, there would be flaws. There was also a chance of dodging the Calamity-grade bullet, but even if he dodged the seventh sure-kill bullet at the beginning, there was still a chance of being hit later. It wouldn’t keep circling around, and it was only a matter of time before the target was hit.</p>
<p>Even if they could gather a high-luck Companion Beast, it was impossible for them to constantly dodge the sure-kill bullets.</p>
<p>“Young Master, it’s good that you’re confident. Leave this to me…” An Sheng’s lips curled up slightly as though he was a devil who had found his prey.</p>
<p>While An Sheng was handling this matter, Zhou Wen took the time to visit the Wang family to return the Invincible Lucky Star to Wang Lu.</p>
<p>Sweetie had been following Zhou Wen all this while, hoping to find an opportunity to figure out where Zhou Wen’s candy box had come from. However, after Zhou Wen returned to the Overseer Manor, there were many people following him. Sweetie failed to find an opportunity to approach him.</p>
<p>Finally, when Zhou Wen came out of the Overseer Manor alone, Sweetie immediately followed him as she planned on how to approach him.</p>
<p>It wasn’t difficult for Sweetie to kill Zhou Wen. The difficult part was getting the answer she wanted.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carried out instant transmission constantly. As he wanted to rush back to the An family as soon as possible, he didn’t rest at all. Sweetie failed to find an opportunity as a result.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the Wang family residence, Zhou Wen teleported to Wang Lu’s building. Wang Lu, who had already received Zhou Wen’s message, opened the door and let Zhou Wen enter before closing it.</p>
<p>What’s he doing? Sweetie followed curiously.. Like a ghost, she passed through the wall and arrived beside Zhou Wen and Wang Lu.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1352'>Chapter 1352: One Takes on the Color of One’s Company</h3>
<p>This fellow, Zhou Wen, is extremely bad. He wanted to use the Heavenly Robe to scam others, and now, he has secretly run into a woman’s room… What does he want to do? Sweetie walked through the building and couldn’t help but feel slightly disappointed when she saw Zhou Wen and Wang Lu sitting at a table and talking. Their clothes were still intact.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here in the middle of the night?” Wang Lu asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I’m here to return the Companion Beast,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You don’t plan on entering the Venusian dimensional zone again?” Wang Lu asked in surprise.</p>
<p>She knew how great of a benefit it was for Zhou Wen to be able to carry people up the rankings. Just doing so led to plenty of resources, resources that couldn’t be bought with money.</p>
<p>“In the future, even if I want to get on the rankings, I want to use my own abilities. I don’t need the Lucky Companion Beasts.” Zhou Wen extended his hand in front of Wang Lu. “Give me your hand.”</p>
<p>“This isn’t the tone a gentleman should use when speaking to a girl.” Wang Lu smiled and placed her finger on Zhou Wen’s palm.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held Wang Lu’s finger and immediately circulated the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art, transferring five Companion Beasts to her.</p>
<p>Other than the Invincible Lucky Star, there was also the Heavenly Robe, the Lady Luck Necklace, the Lucky Stone Sprite, and the Lucky Clover King.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen transferred all his Mythical Luck Companion Beasts to Wang Lu.</p>
<p>Without the Invincible Luck Star, Lucky Dodge was already useless. It was useless keeping so many Luck Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>However, in Wang Lu’s hands, they could play a huge role.</p>
<p>Of course, Luck Companion Beasts could still increase his drop rate. If not for the fact that he wanted to return Wang Lu’s favor, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have handed them to her so easily.</p>
<p>“Is this what you call a fivefold return?” After Wang Lu received the Companion Beasts, she sensed the information from them. Her expression suddenly changed. “If you give me the Heavenly Robe, what about you?”</p>
<p>“You have the Invincible Lucky Star, so the effects of the Heavenly Robe can be maximized. It’s not very useful for me to keep it. Besides, I have more than one Heavenly Robe.” Zhou Wen paused and exhorted, “However, don’t let anyone know that you have the Heavenly Robe and Luck Companion Beasts for the time being.”</p>
<p>“You want to sell the Heavenly Robe?” Wang Lu was extremely smart and immediately figured out what Zhou Wen wanted to do.</p>
<p>“Smart,” Zhou Wen praised.</p>
<p>“In that case, I can take the opportunity to make a killing,” said Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“You want to sell some Luck Companion Beasts?” Zhou Wen also guessed what Wang Lu wanted to do.</p>
<p>After the Heavenly Robe was sold, the person who obtained it would definitely want to exploit it to its fullest. They would go around collecting Luck Companion Beasts like Zhou Wen had done in the past.</p>
<p>When the time came, the price of Luck Companion Beasts would definitely skyrocket. Zhou Wen prepared to sell the low-level Luck Companion Beasts he kept when that happened.</p>
<p>In any case, without the Invincible Lucky Star, there wasn’t much use in keeping so many Luck Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Just as An Sheng had said, there was actually an upper limit to the luck attribute. It meant that the luck attribute wouldn’t stack indefinitely if one brought more Luck Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>“I’ve collected quite a number of Luck Companion Eggs in the past, but because they are duplicates and don’t add much luck, I haven’t hatched them. I only keep them as backup. I can use this opportunity to sell them at a high price. I might be able to earn tens or hundreds of times more,” Wang Lu said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll congratulate you in advance for making a killing,” Zhou Wen said as he raised his teacup.</p>
<p>“To us, for the killing we will make together.” Wang Lu also raised her teacup.</p>
<p>What a shameless couple! Sweetie understood their conversation. She originally thought that Wang Lu was quite pure and pretty, but she never expected her to be so nasty. She couldn’t help but mutter.</p>
<p>Looking at the two of them smiling at each other, Sweetie felt as if her soul had been corrupted.</p>
<p>No, I have to think of a way to find out the origins of the candy box as soon as possible. Sweetie felt that her heart wouldn’t be pure anymore if she continued following Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>After some thought, she felt that it was impossible to approach Zhou Wen under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>There’s no need to worry so much when dealing with such despicable villains. I should fight fire with fire and use some extreme methods. Sweetie already had an idea and planned on using methods similar to Zhou Wen’s.</p>
<p>It was a pity that Sweetie didn’t understand the principle of taking the color of one’s company. Once she was tainted by the color, it would be difficult for her to revert.</p>
<p>When a person used the same method to take revenge on a bad person, she could no longer revert to a pure slate. Moreover, Sweetie’s previous living environment was too clean. It was so clean that she was like a piece of white paper, and white paper was the easiest to dye with color.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen left the Wang family, he spent the entire night traveling, hoping to return to Luoyang as soon as possible.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo wasn’t in Luoyang, so he couldn’t stay outside for long. If something happened, he wouldn’t be able to deal with it in time.</p>
<p>It was a dark night with strong winds. Zhou Wen was instant transmitting when he suddenly saw a blonde girl in white standing at the edge of the forest in front of him. However, on a careful look, the blonde girl had vanished like a ghost.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen almost imagined that he was seeing things. Just as he was about to rub his eyes, he suddenly saw the blonde girl appear in front of him again. She was so close that he could see her eyelashes clearly. Her hair was disheveled and her face was pale. She was as terrifying as a malicious ghost.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed as he immediately instant transmitted in retreat. He kept doing so in an attempt to escape as he muttered inwardly, Why is that blonde girl chasing after me again? How did she find me? Could she be a ghost?</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen finished instant transmission, he realized that the blonde girl was in front of him. He was immediately alarmed as he teleported in another direction.</p>
<p>But no matter where he instant transmitted to, the blonde girl would be standing there, looking at him expressionlessly like a ghost.</p>
<p>After his instant transmission failed to evade her, Zhou Wen teleported to Venus.</p>
<p>However, when he stood on Venus, he realized that the blonde girl was still standing in front of him, staring at him like a vengeful ghost.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had goosebumps as he looked at the blonde girl and forced a smile. He coughed lightly and said, “Um, we don’t seem to have any grudges, right? Why are you chasing me?”</p>
<p>“My death was so unjust. You caused my death. I want you to go to hell with me,” the blonde girl said with a voice that sounded like a malicious spirit.</p>
<p>“When did I cause your death?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he asked the blond girl.</p>
<p>“Back at the chocolate shop, you could have saved me. It was because you left me in the lurch that I died. Now, I want you to die with me.” As the blonde girl spoke, her figure constantly flashed around Zhou Wen. It was impossible for Zhou Wen to determine her location.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t even notice the blonde girl standing behind him.</p>
<p>Could there really be ghosts in this world? Zhou Wen’s legs turned to jelly.</p>
<p>He could only be considered half an atheist because he had heard too many ghost stories from his grandfather when he was young. Therefore, although he knew logically that there were no ghosts in the world and that they were at most dimensional creatures, he still felt fear sometimes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with the hearing that Truth Listener had provided him, it was impossible for him not to sense any movement even if it was a Calamity-grade. It was even more impossible for him not to notice someone standing behind him.</p>
<p>This blonde girl really did seem like a ghost.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1353'>Chapter 1353: I’m Not Sweetie</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“I died so tragically… I died so tragically…” The blonde girl’s hair was disheveled as she floated towards Zhou Wen and let out a terrifying cry. She looked like a haunting ghost.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated as he couldn’t help but take two steps back. He wanted to escape, but he couldn’t think of where to run. Since the other party could keep up with his interstellar teleportation ability, it didn’t seem like there was anywhere he could run.</p>
<p>When a person was forced into a corner, they would not know how to be afraid. Or rather, they would be numb with fear.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was just about to go all out when the blonde girl floated over like a ghost. Perhaps it was because she was too excited, or perhaps it was because she had failed to notice her surroundings after successfully frightening Zhou Wen—</p>
<p>As she flew in the air, she didn’t notice that her blonde hair had been caught by a sharp rock protruding from the side. When she charged forward, her hair was yanked back and she immediately fell to the ground in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the blonde girl who had fallen to the ground. When their eyes met, the air seemed to freeze.</p>
<p>Swoosh!</p>
<p>The blonde girl seemed to instant transmit back into the air as though nothing had happened. She continued floating towards Zhou Wen and once again shouted, “I died so tragically… I died so tragically…”</p>
<p>However, for some reason, Zhou Wen no longer had any fear. He looked at the blonde girl and felt like laughing.</p>
<p>The blonde girl was clearly still terrifying and Zhou Wen was definitely no match for her, but he couldn’t feel the same fear as before.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen could tell that the blonde girl seemed to have some concerns. She only circled around him to scare him and didn’t really attack.</p>
<p>Otherwise, with the strength the blonde girl had just displayed, she could have attacked him from behind without him noticing. There was no need for her to go through all this trouble.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood motionless and all the blonde girl did was appear and disappear around him as she let out terrifying cries. Apart from that, she didn’t do anything else.</p>
<p>“Then what should I do to let you die in peace?” Zhou Wen felt that he should give her a way out. After all, she was a big shot.</p>
<p>If she really didn’t have an out, she might really kill him out of embarrassment.</p>
<p>When the blonde girl heard Zhou Wen, she immediately stopped and pointed at the candy box in his pocket. Without any hesitation, she said, “Tell me, where did you get your candy box from?”</p>
<p>The blonde girl was just too inexperienced. She immediately revealed her goal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he sized up the blonde girl. He seemed to realize something and blurted out, “You are Sweetie, right?”</p>
<p>“How do you know… I’m not the beautiful and cute Sweetie… You’ve got the wrong person…” The blonde girl waved her hand in a hurry to draw a line.</p>
<p>“That’s a pity. I picked up this candy box in Sweetie’s Hut and thought that it should be Sweetie’s. I kept thinking of returning it to the beautiful and cute Sweetie, but I couldn’t find her…” Zhou Wen took out the candy box and held it in his hand.</p>
<p>“Which hut did you find it in?” Sweetie hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“On a doll in the Chaos Hut.” Zhou Wen had already guessed that the blonde girl was most likely Sweetie.</p>
<p>Thinking back to what the woman in the wooden hut had said, Zhou Wen roughly knew that the blonde girl was probably the terrifying existence the woman had mentioned.</p>
<p>“You’re lying. How could my doll steal the candy box?” Sweetie said in disbelief.</p>
<p>That terrifying doll is just her toy doll? What’s the origin of this Sweetie? A dimensional zone like the Time Hut is actually named after her… As Zhou Wen thought, he said, “Why would I lie? You won’t be able to verify it even if I randomly said that I picked it up from a table. Besides, if I didn’t find it on a doll, how would I know that there was a doll?”</p>
<p>Sweetie was stunned by the question. She thought carefully and realized that it was true.</p>
<p>“Give me the candy box,” said Sweetie.</p>
<p>“I can’t give you the candy box,” Zhou Wen said as he retracted the candy box and shook his head.</p>
<p>“Why can’t you give it to me? It’s not yours,” said Sweetie.</p>
<p>“It’s not mine, but it’s not yours either. This is the beautiful, kind, and cute Sweetie’s candy box. I was in danger back in the Chaos Hut. I nearly fell into a hopeless situation. When I was about to give up, it was this candy box that gave me hope. It allowed me to have the courage to continue forging forward. Only then did I come out alive… I have to personally return it to the gentle and kind Sweetie… Even if you want to kill me, I won’t give it to you.” Zhou Wen had been with Li Xuan and the antelope for a long time, so he had clearly been led astray by them.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Sweetie’s face flushed red. Her oppressive aura seemed to dissipate instantly.</p>
<p>“Did you eat the lemon candy inside?” Sweetie pretended to be fine as she asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What lemon candy? I just got an empty box.” Zhou Wen shook his head.</p>
<p>That’s strange. Although the lemon candy has the ability to break one’s order in life, it should be useless for the doll… Sweetie frowned in thought.</p>
<p>She originally imagined that the candy box had been lost in the Past Hut, resulting in her inability to find it. It turned out to be in the Chaos Hut, and it was in the hands of her doll.</p>
<p>It meant that things weren’t as simple as just losing it.</p>
<p>There was no reason why she couldn’t find it in the Chaos Hut. There was only one possibility for not finding the candy box back then—someone had hidden it.</p>
<p>Back then, the only people in the Time Hut were her, Little Chrysanthemum, Yana, Spacetime Piglet, and the doll. Spacetime Piglet and the doll were Sweetie’s toys. The lemon candy was useless to them.</p>
<p>Little Chrysanthemum was a loyal servant. It was impossible for her to steal the candy box and lemon candy. Even if she wanted them, she only needed to ask. There was no need to steal them.</p>
<p>“It can’t be Yana!” Although Sweetie thought of the most likely conclusion, she was unwilling to believe it.</p>
<p>“Is Yana a rather beautiful woman who can grow six wings…” Zhou Wen described Yana.</p>
<p>“Did you kill Yana?” Sweetie bit her lip and asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“If the Yana you mentioned is that woman, I killed her,” Zhou Wen admitted readily.</p>
<p>“Why did you kill her?” Sweetie asked with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>“Because she’s evil. If I didn’t kill her, she would’ve killed me,” Zhou Wen said solemnly.</p>
<p>“Why would she kill you?” Sweetie didn’t believe that Yana was such a person.</p>
<p>“How would I know? She was completely unreasonable. She wanted me dead the moment we met. However, now that I think about it, it might have been because she knew that the candy box was with me and wanted to snatch it away..” Zhou Wen connected the dots, but he deliberately skipped on some of the details.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1354'>Chapter 1354: I Don’t Want To Eat It</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Sweetie was hesitant. She treated Yana as a friend, so it was unlikely that she would steal her candy box.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s sincere expression didn’t seem like he was lying.</p>
<p>“If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave now. I’m still in a hurry to find the gentle and beautiful Sweetie. I need to return the candy box to its rightful owner,” Zhou Wen said as he turned around and left.</p>
<p>“Wait a moment.” Sweetie stopped Zhou Wen and walked towards him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt stifled, but he could only stop and ask Sweetie, “Anything else?”</p>
<p>“If what you said is true, can you…” Sweetie extended her hand as though she wanted Zhou Wen to shake it.</p>
<p>However, Sweetie seemed to realize something and quickly retracted her hand.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Zhou Wen looked at Sweetie in puzzlement, unsure what she meant.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. Sweetie and I are good friends. In order to prevent you from secretly taking the candy box, I’ve decided to follow you until we find Sweetie and return the candy box to its rightful owner.” Sweetie said it very naturally. She didn’t realize that she seemed to be getting better at lying. Even her face didn’t blush.</p>
<p>“But you are a ghost? How can you follow me?” Zhou Wen felt his head ache. If he really kept such a time bomb by his side, who knew when she would explode?</p>
<p>“Why not? Of course. From now on, I’ll follow you closely. If I discover that you lied to me, I’ll take you to hell with me,” Sweetie said, acting all fierce.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment. Since he couldn’t beat her, he had to think of a way to let her leave on her own accord.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Sweetie looked like a gullible girl. It shouldn’t be difficult to fool her.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned around and continued on his way. With Sweetie’s abilities, he didn’t have much room to resist if she really wanted him dead. It was useless to be afraid, so he decided to do whatever he needed to do.</p>
<p>Sweetie followed behind Zhou Wen. No matter how fast Zhou Wen was, be it instant transmission or Earth Escape, he couldn’t shake her off. Every time he turned his head, he would see Sweetie standing silently behind him like a ghost.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen walked, he thought to himself, Sweetie said that the lemon candy has the effect of breaking one’s order in life. I wonder what this order in life refers to? Is it the level? Will eating that thing advance me from the Mythical stage to the Terror grade?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had the urge to take out the lemon candy to give it a try, but with Sweetie by his side, taking it out now was equivalent to having a death wish. Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t do such a foolish thing.</p>
<p>Sweetie followed Zhou Wen like a haunting ghost. She didn’t say a word and just followed. Her thoughts were a mystery.</p>
<p>Sweetie actually didn’t believe Zhou Wen’s words, but she couldn’t find any evidence to prove that Zhou Wen was lying. Therefore, she thought of following Zhou Wen first. If he was lying, his flaws would show sooner or later.</p>
<p>Previously, Sweetie had thought that if Zhou Wen had lied, he would immediately turn into gold the moment he touched her.</p>
<p>However, when she thought of what Zhou Wen had done, Sweetie felt that even if he wasn’t lying, he would definitely turn into gold if he touched her. Therefore, that method was useless to test him. Zhou Wen would turn into gold regardless.</p>
<p>After arriving in a city, Zhou Wen planned on resting and getting some food.</p>
<p>Of course, eating was secondary. The main reason was that he didn’t dare take Sweetie back to Luoyang. He had to think through it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked on the streets for a while before choosing a dessert shop to enter. He also ordered some cake, cookies, and pizza.</p>
<p>Sweetie caught a whiff of the sweet fragrance and her eyes widened. The corners of her mouth turned slightly moist.</p>
<p>“Do you want to eat anything? It’s my treat…” Zhou Wen handed the dessert menu to Sweetie.</p>
<p>Don’t think that you can bribe me with just this… Sweetie only said it in her heart without saying it out loud. The main reason was that she really didn’t have any resistance towards desserts.</p>
<p>“Oh, right, you are a ghost. How can a ghost eat desserts? It’s my fault for not being inconsiderate. When I pass by an incense shop, I’ll buy you some paper money…” Sweetie was already about to reach out to take the dessert menu when Zhou Wen retracted it and placed it on the table before he began eating.</p>
<p>Sweetie was immediately petrified. When she saw Zhou Wen swallow the adorable pudding, her heart ached so much that it almost bled.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Of course I won’t eat these things… Of course… I won’t…” As Sweetie spoke, the corners of her eyes and mouth twitched.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pretended not to see Sweetie staring intently at the desserts in front of him. He quickly finished all the desserts.</p>
<p>“I’ll go settle the bill. Wait outside for me,” Zhou Wen said as he walked over to make payment.</p>
<p>Unable to eat despite wanting to, Sweetie felt that she was better off dead. All she wanted was to leave this place quickly and walk out without looking back.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen walked out.</p>
<p>Sweetie saw that Zhou Wen was holding a box in his hand. When she used her penetrative vision, she saw that it was a very beautiful mini cake. Although it was only a small piece, it was layered and looked very beautiful. It even emitted a rich milky fragrance.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you have your fill just now? Why did you get another piece as takeaway?” Sweetie wished she could stomp Zhou Wen in the face. Not only had he eaten that much, but he had even gotten takeaway while she couldn’t even get a single bite.</p>
<p>“Oh, this piece was an extra. They forgot to serve it. When I made payment, I realized that I had ordered this. I’m stuffed, so I could only do takeaway,” Zhou Wen said as he suddenly handed the bag to Sweetie.</p>
<p>Sweetie was immediately delighted as she thought to herself, Is he giving it to me? Should I accept it? How can I accept something given to me by such a baddy… However, it doesn’t seem appropriate to reject the good intentions of others…</p>
<p>“Help me throw it away,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>Sweetie’s expression immediately darkened as she stared at Zhou Wen and said, “Isn’t it a waste to throw away such nice dessert?”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing I can do about it. I can’t eat anymore. If you find it troublesome and don’t wish to help me, I’ll throw it away myself,” Zhou Wen said as he retracted his hand.</p>
<p>However, Sweetie’s eyes suddenly lit up. She hurriedly reached out and snatched the bag over. As she turned around and walked to the side, she said, “Let me help you. Don’t throw it randomly. It won’t be good if you dirty the streets.”</p>
<p>As she spoke, Sweetie’s figure drifted away and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>After turning a corner, Sweetie sneaked a peek of Zhou Wen. Seeing that he wasn’t paying attention to her and was walking forward slowly, she heaved a sigh of relief. She turned her head and leaned against the wall. She opened the box in the bag and raised the cake in front of her.</p>
<p>It’s not that I want to eat it, but it’s a waste to throw it. It will also pollute the environment. I can only force myself for the better good… Sweetie convinced herself. She puffed up her cheeks and bit off a large piece, filling up her cheeks. She was so happy that she was about to cry.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t turn his head as the corners of his mouth twitched.. He took out his phone and sent several messages.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1355'>Chapter 1355: Clear Answer</h3>
<p>“I’ve found myself ensnared by a terrifying creature that likes to eat desserts. Help me investigate which powerful mythical existence likes desserts. It should be a Mythical creature from the West District.” Zhou Wen sent the message out en masse.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, good luck to you,” Li Xuan replied.</p>
<p>“I’ll investigate now. Wait.” It was An Sheng.</p>
<p>“A terrifying creature that likes desserts. Why would a bastard like you be afraid?” Hui Haifeng teased.</p>
<p>“An hour.” Gu Dian’s reply was somewhat reliable.</p>
<p>“Other than liking desserts, is there any other information?” Wang Lu also replied.</p>
<p>“Do you need my help?” Zhang Yuzhi’s answer was very direct.</p>
<p>“Where are you? I’ll head over immediately.” Feng Qiuyan was very direct.</p>
<p>“Coach, wait for me.” Ming Xiu also sent a message.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen scanned the messages and didn’t receive any useful answers. Clearly, no one knew of such a Mythical creature.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a message popped up in Zhou Wen’s eyes. When he saw the shimmering flower avatar, his heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>The person using the flower as an image was naturally The Thearch. Zhou Wen hurriedly opened the message to take a look.</p>
<p>“Is it a blonde girl?” Zhou Wen was immediately overjoyed when he saw The Thearch’s message. From the looks of it, The Thearch knew about Sweetie.</p>
<p>“Yes, do you know her origin?” Zhou Wen hurriedly replied while Sweetie was still sampling the cake.</p>
<p>“Prepare your funeral as soon as possible. If there’s anything you want to eat, do so quickly. If you have any unfulfilled wishes, well… I reckon it’ll be too late to fulfill them.” The Thearch’s message left Zhou Wen alarmed.</p>
<p>“The Thearch, are you going to tell me that as long as we carry on with our previous deal, I’ll be able to live?” Zhou Wen replied.</p>
<p>“There’s no need for any deal. What deal can you make with a dead person?” The Thearch quickly replied.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen really felt that something was amiss. The Thearch didn’t think of taking the opportunity to make a deal with him. It seemed a little serious.</p>
<p>“What’s her background?” Zhou Wen asked directly.</p>
<p>The Thearch didn’t answer. Instead, she asked Zhou Wen a question. “Are you a believer of any faith?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was taken aback when he saw this. He didn’t know if his beliefs had anything to do with this matter, but he thought carefully and couldn’t say for the moment if he had any.</p>
<p>When it came to faith, he didn’t believe in any religion, nor did he pray to gods. At most, he was a fair weather atheist who turned to god in a pinch.</p>
<p>However, it was actually wrong to say that he had no faith. Although Zhou Wen didn’t respect ghosts and gods, he had his own beliefs. He wasn’t a complete atheist.</p>
<p>“That depends on what you mean by faith. If you mean a particular religion, I don’t have any,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“It’s good that you don’t have one,” The Thearch replied ambiguously, making Zhou Wen confused.</p>
<p>Thankfully, The Thearch immediately sent another message. “Even if you don’t have any faith, you should have heard of the name God, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course I’ve heard of it. I just don’t know which church the God you mentioned is from. According to what I know, the God of our East District refers to the God of Heaven. As for the God of the West District, he’s the omniscient and omnipotent god.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated as he immediately sent another message. “Could that blonde girl be related to God of the West District?”</p>
<p>One had to know that God was the ruler of a pantheon—a supreme existence.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi was only a demigod of a pantheon, but she was already that powerful. If the God of the West really existed, his strength was obvious. To be able to be related to him definitely made one an extremely terrifying existence.</p>
<p>From the six-winged seraphim powers that Yana showed and Sweetie’s appearance, it was not strange that they had something to do with God.</p>
<p>“It does have something to do with it.” The Thearch gave an affirmative answer.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought carefully. With his meager knowledge of West District myths, the women related to God were likely angels.</p>
<p>However, it was really difficult to say if angels were considered women. Although many angels were given the appearance of women, angels were actually genderless.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen’s eyes suddenly lit up as he immediately sent a message to The Thearch. “Could it be that the blonde girl is Eve or her child?”</p>
<p>He could only think of one woman, and she was the one that resulted in Original Sin.</p>
<p>“Your imagination is quite rich, but unfortunately, you guessed wrongly. I’ll give you two more chances. Guess again.” The Thearch rejected Zhou Wen’s guess.</p>
<p>“I’m stumped. Could she be an angel?” Zhou Wen probed.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, you are very smart, but sometimes, you are very stupid. Can’t you see such an obvious answer?” The Thearch’s message was filled with mockery.</p>
<p>“How can I tell? How is there an obvious answer?” Zhou Wen asked. His understanding of the West District myths was limited, so it was normal that he couldn’t guess it.</p>
<p>Beep! Beep! A message was immediately sent. Zhou Wen was surprised to discover that the message The Thearch had sent was a voice message.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen clicked on the message and immediately heard a very charming female voice. Upon hearing this voice, it generated images of a charming and powerful mature lady in his mind, or a lofty queen sitting on a throne with crossed legs—ones wrapped in black stockings.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to appreciate the voice because the words left him stunned.</p>
<p>“I’ve already told you her name, but you ignored it. What a fool.”</p>
<p>The corners of Zhou Wen’s eyes twitched as he stared intently at the phone screen. The Thearch had only mentioned one name—”God.”</p>
<p>“Are you telling me that God is a blonde girl? And she especially likes desserts?” Zhou Wen didn’t believe it at all.</p>
<p>“Otherwise?” The Thearch mocked.</p>
<p>Although I don’t know much about West District’s God, I also know that God is a trinity. Holy Father, Holy Son, and Holy Spirit, there’s no Holy Lady. How can God be a girl? Zhou Wen felt that The Thearch was probably bluffing him.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if you believe me or not. As you are doomed, enjoy whatever’s left of your life. Also, I’ll give you a friendly reminder. Under no circumstances are you to touch her.” After The Thearch said that, she went offline and her avatar dimmed.</p>
<p>God is a blonde girl who likes desserts? Zhou Wen found it a little unreal. No matter how he looked at it, Sweetie didn’t look like God.</p>
<p>If God is really a naive blonde girl, wouldn’t this world be in chaos? Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1356'>Chapter 1356: Terrifying Sweetie</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was ruminating over the problem, Sweetie walked over from afar. She wore a guilty expression, and he could even see tiny breadcrumbs staining the corner of her mouth.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen look at the corner of her mouth, Sweetie seemed to realize something. She reached out and quickly wiped the corner of her mouth as she said, “Why are you looking at me?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. I just found you a little familiar all of a sudden.” Zhou Wen compared Sweetie’s appearance to the legendary God and really couldn’t find any similarities between the two.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen you before,” Sweetie said immediately.</p>
<p>“Mm, that’s alright. It’s time for us to continue on our way.” Zhou Wen felt mixed emotions.</p>
<p>According to The Thearch, as long as he touched Sweetie, there was almost no chance of survival. If he accidentally touched her along the way, wouldn’t he be doomed?</p>
<p>Thinking of the golden statues that had strangely appeared in the capital, Zhou Wen had already guessed what had happened.</p>
<p>The most terrifying thing was that if he took Sweetie back, it would be even more troublesome if the people around him touched her.</p>
<p>No, I can’t return to Luoyang before resolving this problem. Zhou Wen frowned as he thought to himself. But if I don’t return to Luoyang, where can I go? With Sweetie around, it’s not safe for me to go anywhere… Wait…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s eyes suddenly lit up as he thought to himself, The Thearch described Sweetie so well. She seems to be afraid of her. What will happen if I take Sweetie to Chess Mountain?</p>
<p>He couldn’t suppress this thought in his mind once he had it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know how powerful The Thearch was, nor did he know how powerful Sweetie was. He couldn’t predict what would happen if the two of them met.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen thought about it, he turned to look at Sweetie with mixed feelings.</p>
<p>Sweetie felt a little nervous. She thought that her mouth was still stained with breadcrumbs, so she hurriedly wiped it again. She deliberately turned to Zhou Wen’s other side and avoided his gaze.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hesitated when he saw Sweetie’s expression.</p>
<p>Sweetie really didn’t look like God. She was clearly a little girl.</p>
<p>I’ll figure out if she’s God first. Zhou Wen hesitated for a moment and didn’t immediately head for Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>“By the way, I still don’t know your name?” Zhou Wen deliberately asked.</p>
<p>“I…” Sweetie said before pausing. Although her disguise was full of flaws, she didn’t think so herself. She believed that she couldn’t say that she was Sweetie. Furthermore, she wasn’t good at lying. She couldn’t think of an answer and was stunned.</p>
<p>“I know your name,” Zhou Wen suddenly said when she didn’t answer.</p>
<p>“What do you know?” Sweetie jumped in fright as she looked at Zhou Wen nervously.</p>
<p>“You’re so cute and beautiful like an angel, so your name must be related to an angel, right?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, Sweetie immediately heaved a sigh of relief and said with a smile, “Angels aren’t cute. They have cold faces like puppets… Not entirely… A few of them are rather interesting…”</p>
<p>“Which ones?” Zhou Wen continued asking, his heart sinking.</p>
<p>Angels were usually considered apostles of God. The more Sweetie knew about angels, the higher the possibility of her being God.</p>
<p>“Lu…” Sweetie had just said a syllable when she suddenly became alarmed. She glared at Zhou Wen and said, “Why should I tell you?”</p>
<p>“Just a casual chat. It’s fine if you don’t want to say. However, aren’t you a ghost? How do you know about angels? Ghosts and angels are natural enemies, right?” Zhou Wen deliberately asked.</p>
<p>“Can’t I have heard stories about them?” Sweetie didn’t know how to lie, but she couldn’t tell the truth either. She shouted angrily out of embarrassment.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen smiled and didn’t say anything else. He kept walking and stopping along the way. It didn’t seem like he was traveling, but like he was having a holiday.</p>
<p>“I don’t like these. Help me throw them away.” Every time they ate, Sweetie could only watch from the side. After eating, he would give her some of her favorite food.</p>
<p>It was easy to see through Sweetie. Everything she liked and disliked was written all over her face.</p>
<p>“It’s such a waste. You will go to hell for that.” Although Sweetie said that, she was secretly delighted. Thankfully, he’s such a wasteful person.</p>
<p>Every time Sweetie secretly hid to eat, Zhou Wen would receive a message.</p>
<p>Up to now, no one had found any western mythical figures who liked to eat desserts. There were a few demons, but they weren’t at the required levels. It was naturally impossible for them to be Sweetie’s true identity.</p>
<p>“Young Master, the matter with the Heavenly Robe has been settled. In a few days, it will be time to take action.” An Sheng sent a message.</p>
<p>“Can you wait a little longer?” Zhou Wen didn’t dare take Sweetie back to Luoyang.</p>
<p>“This matter has already been set in motion. It won’t be easy to stop. I can only give it a try to stall for a few more days,” An Sheng replied.</p>
<p>“Alright, try your best to stall for a few days and maintain contact. If you really can’t stall any longer, tell me.” Zhou Wen also knew that such matters couldn’t be stopped just like that.</p>
<p>After discussing with An Sheng for a while, Zhou Wen sent messages while paying attention to Sweetie.</p>
<p>Although he couldn’t precisely sense Sweetie’s location, he could determine where she was and what she was doing through the changes in his surroundings.</p>
<p>After all, anyone who saw such a beautiful blonde girl would take a few more glances, allowing Zhou Wen to determine what Sweetie was doing.</p>
<p>A youth’s eyes lit up when he saw Sweetie by the side of the road. He walked to her and said, “Why is such a beautiful girl squatting by the side and eating alone? Are you homeless? Follow me. I guarantee that you won’t have to worry about food and clothes.”</p>
<p>Sweetie ignored him and turned to leave.</p>
<p>When the youth saw that he had been ignored, he was immediately infuriated. He reached out and grabbed Sweetie’s shoulder. At the same time, he said coldly, “Who let you leave? In West Song City, no one dares to not give me, Ximen Leng…”</p>
<p>As he spoke, his fingers had already touched the clothes on Sweetie’s shoulder. A golden light immediately lit up at his fingertips like a lit match.</p>
<p>Almost instantly, the youth’s body turned into gold amidst the golden light. He still maintained the stance of extending his hand and speaking.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared at this scene and felt his heart turn cold. Although he had already guessed it, he was still extremely shocked to see it with his own eyes.</p>
<p>Ximen Leng was likely at the Mythical stage after using the Mythical Serum. He was considered a top-notch expert among humans, but just by touching Sweetie’s clothes, he turned into gold.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was very glad that he hadn’t touched Sweetie before.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1357'>Chapter 1357: Soul Mirror</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen had second thoughts and felt that Sweetie being so strong wasn’t necessarily a bad thing for him.</p>
<p>Sweetie definitely doesn’t want me dead now that she wants to figure out the story behind the candy box and lemon candy. Should I take her around those terrifying dimensional zones? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Whether he died or not was a matter of the future. With God by his side, it didn’t seem right not to carry out some exploitation.</p>
<p>However, where he went was something worth considering.</p>
<p>If he went to Chess Mountain, the risk was still too high. The Thearch knew who Sweetie was. It wouldn’t be easy to control her. He might even have things backfire.</p>
<p>To the Fiend Tomb? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that he should skip it.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that easy to deal with Drought Demon Fairy. More importantly, Drought Demon Fairy was a Guardian. There was no benefit in killing her.</p>
<p>I have to think of a way to kill a Calamity-grade dimensional creature with Sweetie. If a Companion Egg drops or something, I’ll make a killing. Just as Zhou Wen was pondering about it, he suddenly felt the mysterious phone vibrate. He took it out and realized that the fruit produced by the Dead Man Tree after absorbing Unkilling Dugu had ripened.</p>
<p>A golden beam tore through the fruit and fused into the blood-colored avatar’s body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen opened the blood-colored avatar’s Companion Beast window and saw a new Companion Beast.</p>
<p>What surprised Zhou Wen was that the Companion Beasts that the Dead Man Tree transformed into after the absorption were related to their owners when they were alive.</p>
<p>However, the Companion Beast transformed by Unkilling Dugu wasn’t in the form of a human. It had nothing to do with humans.</p>
<p>It was a golden mirror. The mirror was oval in shape, and there were hollowed flower patterns on the edge. Its entire body was like colored glass made of gold.</p>
<p>However, the mirror may look smooth, one would realize that although it was flat, it had the feeling of a multi-faceted surface like a diamond. It seemed to have been cut from different angles.</p>
<p>When one stood in front of the mirror, the figure inside appeared disjointed and distorted. It was impossible to tell that it was a person.</p>
<p>Soul Mirror: Mortal (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Strength: 11</p>
<p>Speed: 11</p>
<p>Constitution: 11</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 11</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Soul-Washing Divine Light</p>
<p>Companion Form: Mirror</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was first taken aback before he was delighted. Although he didn’t know what abilities the Soul Mirror had after obtaining a Life Providence, Life Soul, and Wheel of Destiny. He didn’t know if they were very strong, just the Soul-Washing Divine Light was worth nurturing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously heard from Unkilling Dugu that this skill was an ability that could directly attack the soul and cleanse human souls.</p>
<p>The so-called cleansing wasn’t to purify the heart and make people change for the better. It was to wash away memories and make them forget the past.</p>
<p>There was an even higher level Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light. It was an ability that could completely eliminate one’s soul. If one was hit by the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light, they would either become an idiot or a vegetable.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have any extravagant hopes of obtaining the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light. Just the Soul-Washing Divine Light was enough.</p>
<p>This skill was already powerful enough. An archenemy would suddenly have his memories wiped after using the Soul-Washing Divine Light. When the time came, it might even fool the opponent into thinking that he was one’s son. How sick was this skill? It was practically a brainwashing skill.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and glanced at Sweetie. It would be great if he could brainwash her. He could make her forget about avenging Yana, and all the problems would be resolved.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen knew very well that it was impossible.</p>
<p>Now, the Soul-Washing Divine Light was still at the Mortal stage. It was probably not of much use. Even if it could advance to the Terror grade, it was still unknown if it could be effective against a big shot like Sweetie.</p>
<p>However, that spelled some hope. It might be useful if he slowly raised its level in the future.</p>
<p>The Evil Spirit King he had previously reared had only reached the Mythical stage. He hadn’t found a way to advance it to the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Evil Spirit King: Mythical (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Spirit Thought Body</p>
<p>Life Soul: Evil Spirit King</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Evil King’s Kill</p>
<p>Strength: 81</p>
<p>Speed: 81</p>
<p>Constitution: 81</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 81</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Spirit Devouring (Inferior)</p>
<p>Companion Form: Soul</p>
<p>Spirit Devouring had helped the Evil Spirit King plunder many Essence Energy Skills from other dimensional creatures. The Evil Spirit King had more Essence Energy Skills than Zhou Wen, making him an all-round fighter.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, his level was a little low. The Mythical stage wasn’t very useful for the present Zhou Wen. If he could advance to the Terror grade, he would become an extremely powerful addition to Zhou Wen’s combat strength.</p>
<p>As it had absorbed all sorts of different skills, the Evil Spirit King could almost deal with most situations.</p>
<p>The Spirit Thought Body Life Providence had also allowed the Evil Spirit King to enter a Spirit Thought Body state. Typical attacks were useless against the Evil Spirit King in its Spirit Thought Body state.</p>
<p>Only psyche or soul-type attacks could injure the Evil Spirit King in its Spirit Thought Body form.</p>
<p>The Life Soul, Evil Spirit King, was an extremely powerful self-strengthening ability. It was equivalent to entering a super state.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Under the super Evil Spirit King state, not only would its various stats increase, but the Evil Spirit King’s Spirit Devouring Skill could even devour creatures that exceeded its level and plunder the skills of high-level creatures.</p>
<p>However, the success rate wasn’t high. Zhou Wen had previously attempted to beat a Terror-grade creature to its last breath and let the Evil Spirit King absorb it, but after dozens of attempts, he only succeeded in absorbing the Precision Shooting of the Terror-grade Golden Battle God.</p>
<p>The Evil Spirit King didn’t have a gun. What was the use of Precision Shooting?</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>From then on, Zhou Wen lost his enthusiasm. He let it absorb skills if there was a chance. It was fine if there wasn’t a chance, nor did he deliberately let him absorb all sorts of higher-level skills.</p>
<p>I wonder what Companion Beast that metal flower will give birth to? Zhou Wen was rather expectant of the metal flower. After all, it was the first creature to be absorbed. It was a creature other than humans.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the metal flower’s fruit had only just appeared. It looked like there was still some time before it ripened.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was thinking about it, his phone suddenly rang. This time, it wasn’t a message, but a phone call.</p>
<p>He picked up his phone and took a look. He realized that it was An Sheng. Zhou Wen immediately felt that something was amiss. If it wasn’t urgent, An Sheng wouldn’t call him, knowing that Sweetie was very likely beside him.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen asked directly after the call connected. He was still thinking, Did something happen with the sale of the Heavenly Robe?</p>
<p>“Young Master, there’s trouble. Our Luoyang seems to be producing a Calamity-grade creature…” An Sheng said with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was taken aback when he heard that. Then, his expression changed drastically as he said, “I’ll rush back immediately. How’s the situation now?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew very well what it meant for a Calamity-grade creature to appear. It would bring about a large-scale calamity. It was impossible for an ordinary person to withstand such a calamity. It was very likely that it would cause a large number of casualties. If things weren’t handled properly, the entire Luoyang would become a dead city.. It was no longer up to him to delay his return.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1358'>Chapter 1358: Military Disaster</h3>
<p>The situation wasn’t as bad as Zhou Wen imagined. This was because Luoyang’s defenses and emergency response were very well-planned. Furthermore, it was only the precursor to a calamity. The true Calamity hadn’t descended, so the losses weren’t too great.</p>
<p>Some ordinary citizens had been injured, although the number of deaths was still within single digits. This was also thanks to the rapid deployment of the Sunset Army.</p>
<p>The precursor to the Calamity didn’t come from Dragon Gate Grotto, but from Luoyang City itself.</p>
<p>Recently, ancient soldiers had often appeared in the ancient city ruins. At first, people thought that they had broken out from one of the dimensional zones.</p>
<p>It was later discovered that the ancient soldiers had crawled out from beneath the ancient city like ghosts. Their ever-increasing numbers made people realize that something was amiss.</p>
<p>After An Sheng, Qin Wufu, and company’s investigations, they confirmed that it was a sign that a Calamity-grade creature was about to appear.</p>
<p>However, up to now, they had yet to determine what kind of Calamity creature would appear. They didn’t know which dimensional zone it was from.</p>
<p>Luoyang had been known as the Ancient Capital for thirteen generations. There were multiple ancient cities in the underground ruins. No one knew how many soldiers and imperial generals were buried there.</p>
<p>The spectral soldiers that appeared all wore different clothes. They came from all ages. It was difficult to determine who had triggered their appearance.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, no matter how powerful the emperors and generals in ancient times were, they only had powers of the human world. They weren’t even Mythical, much less Calamity.</p>
<p>However, everything indicated that a Calamity-grade creature related to ancient soldiers was about to appear.</p>
<p>An Sheng and company perused through historical data, but they didn’t find out who the Calamity-grade existence was.</p>
<p>This was because the spectral soldiers that appeared hadn’t reached a very high level. Some spectral generals were only at the Epic stage. Occasionally, a Mythical general would appear. The Sunset Army could still keep the situation under control, but as time passed, under the influence of the Calamity-grade creature, the spectral soldiers and generals’ levels would become higher and higher until the Calamity grade appeared and formed a terrifying military disaster. When that happened, it would probably be difficult to defend Luoyang.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t confident that he could defeat a Calamity-grade, but when he thought of Sweetie beside him, he felt that there was still a chance.</p>
<p>Even God is by my side. I don’t believe that I can’t deal with a mere Calamity. Zhou Wen didn’t continue wandering around as he headed straight for Luoyang with Sweetie. He couldn’t be bothered anymore.</p>
<p>Sweetie had been following Zhou Wen all this time, hoping to discover his flaws and find the truth about the candy box, so she naturally didn’t give up.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen returned to Luoyang, he saw a group of armored soldiers with spears wandering in the forest.</p>
<p>The soldiers’ armor was tattered and their bodies looked like zombies. They were ugly with many rotting spots.</p>
<p>However, they weren’t as stiff as zombies. Not only were they able to move freely, but they were also very agile.</p>
<p>When the soldiers saw Zhou Wen, they immediately charged forward. Zhou Wen slapped them in the air, immediately dismembering them and causing their flesh to fall to the ground.</p>
<p>However, one of the ancient soldiers, who had his lower body severed and only had its upper body left, was still crawling towards Zhou Wen with both hands. It looked extremely strange.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen struck again and blasted the ancient soldier’s body apart before killing him.</p>
<p>This place is still dozens of kilometers away from Luoyang City. Even soldiers have appeared here. From the looks of it, the Calamity is approaching. Zhou Wen continued towards Luoyang City.</p>
<p>Along the way, he saw more and more ancient soldiers. When the numbers increased to the point of him not being able to quickly dispatch them, Zhou Wen decided to ignore them and continuously instant transmitted towards the city.</p>
<p>The vicinity of Luoyang had turned into an ancient battlefield. There were ancient soldiers everywhere. The closer they were to the city, the more ancient soldiers there were.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw from afar that the Sunset Army was relying on defensive fortifications to engage the soldiers in an intense battle. Gunshots sounded incessantly.</p>
<p>The bullets made of Essence Gold constantly shot into the ancient soldiers’ bodies, but the ancient soldiers continued charging at them crazily. Many bullets were needed to knock them to the ground.</p>
<p>Even if their heads exploded, the headless ancient soldiers would still charge over crazily.</p>
<p>The best way to kill them was to penetrate their hearts. As long as their hearts exploded, the ancient soldiers would fall to the ground and never get up again.</p>
<p>However, the ancient soldiers weren’t slow. It wasn’t easy to strike the heart.</p>
<p>Bullets whistled through the air and shells exploded from time to time. There were also Companion Beasts that charged into the battlefield and fought the ancient soldiers under the command of their owners. Although there weren’t any human casualties, it was already rather tragic.</p>
<p>From time to time, Companion Beasts would fall from their injuries or be summoned back by their owners.</p>
<p>Sweetie followed Zhou Wen and couldn’t help but frown when she saw this scene. She seemed extremely uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen returned to Overseer Manor. An Sheng was already waiting for him at the entrance, so he asked, “Ah Sheng, have you found the source of the Calamity-grade existence?”</p>
<p>An Sheng shook his head. “As we can’t find out which Calamity-grade creature it is, it’s very difficult to determine which dimensional zone it’s coming from. All we know now is that it’s definitely a dimensional zone in the dungeon. Deputy Governor Qin and I studied it and found four dimensional zones in the dungeon to be the most suspicious. We’ve already sent investigators out. We’re hoping for good news.”</p>
<p>The two of them chatted as they walked. Zhou Wen naturally knew that it was best to nip a Calamity-grade creature in the bud. If they didn’t allow it to appear, the damage it caused would naturally be minimized.</p>
<p>However, now that they didn’t even know which dimensional zone it came from, they clearly couldn’t count on this plan. The Sunset Army was actually already prepared to deal with the Calamity.</p>
<p>The only thing he was afraid of was that the Calamity creature would stay on Earth for too long. If they couldn’t hold out until it left Earth, Luoyang would be doomed.</p>
<p>Some even suggested that they temporarily evacuate Luoyang.</p>
<p>It may be easy for the Sunset Army and Zhou Wen to evacuate, but it wasn’t easy to evacuate the ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that they couldn’t leave, but how could ordinary citizens survive outside without the city’s protection?</p>
<p>Now that there were break-out creatures everywhere outside, ordinary citizens had no chance of survival. Furthermore, the military couldn’t safely evacuate so many citizens.</p>
<p>“There’s another thorny problem. Due to the Calamity, we have no choice but to distribute our manpower. The Overseer Manor’s defense is much weaker. The fellows who wanted to get your help previously are now stirring. The Overseer Manor isn’t safe anymore.” An Sheng’s eyes were terrifyingly cold.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1359'>Chapter 1359: Capital of the Gods</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“Those aren’t problems. Tell me, which are the four possible dimensional zones?” Zhou Wen knew a little about the dungeon, but because there were too many dimensional zones there, he couldn’t guess which was a viable candidate.</p>
<p>An Sheng said, “After a discussion between a few mythical scholars and historians, we believe that there are four dimensional zones which are most likely. The first is Luoyi City. This city is deep in the underground dungeon. Up to now, we haven’t been able to completely explore it. The area that humans have explored is only its periphery.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said, “King Wu’s expedition against Zhou. After King Wu destroyed the Shang dynasty, he established a city here named Luoyi. In West Zhou, a one-country, two-capital system was enacted. Luoyi City had a total of ten emperors for West Zhou, while East Zhou had twenty-five emperors. That era was the period closest to the Mythical era. If there’s an emperor or general in the human world that can trigger a calamity, I’m afraid it’s only from that era.”</p>
<p>An Sheng nodded. “That’s what we thought too. The second dimensional zone is called Yang City. It’s the lowest-level dimensional zone in the known dungeon. Legend has it that the founding monarch of the Xia Dynasty, Yu the Great, settled in Luoyang City. Back then, it was called Yang City. However, we have all heard of the legend of Yu the Great’s controlling of waters. It happened around the end of the Mythical era. No one has been able to enter Yang City to date. It’s also a suspicious candidate.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded. It was the dungeon at the bottom. Now that there were ancient soldiers from all dynasties, this meant that every part of the dungeon was affected. The lower dimensional zones were a greater suspicion.</p>
<p>“The third dimensional zone is called the Capital of the Gods. During the reign of the only empress in history, she changed the name of Luoyang to Capital of the Gods. It’s also the only place with the official name, Capital of the Gods, in history. It has the meaning of being the capital under the heavens.” An Sheng stopped here, but he didn’t explain why the historian and the theologian had listed it as a candidate.</p>
<p>After a pause, An Sheng continued, “We were very suspicious of the fourth dimensional zone, but the people who went to investigate have already returned. It’s rather stable. It shouldn’t be the birthplace of the Calamity.”</p>
<p>“In that case, the most likely place is Luoyi City, Yang City, or the Capital of the Gods?” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“The people we sent to the three places to investigate haven’t returned. There’s been no news,” An Sheng answered.</p>
<p>“You’ll guard Luoyang. I’ll visit the three dungeons,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You can’t… There’s very little information about those three dimensional zones to begin with… In this situation… I won’t be able to answer Madam Lan and Uncle Zhou… if anything happens…” An Sheng stopped him.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll be fine. Give me your hand,” Zhou Wen said to An Sheng.</p>
<p>“What for?” An Sheng extended his hand in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his hand and pressed it on An Sheng’s palm. Immediately, golden streams of light entered An Sheng’s palm.</p>
<p>“Golden Battle Gods… Five of them… Young Master, what are you doing?” An Sheng asked Zhou Wen in surprise.</p>
<p>“Luoyang must hold before I return. This is just a precaution.” Having failed to obtain the last Golden Battle God, Zhou Wen couldn’t fuse them. He didn’t usually use such Companion Beasts to begin with, so he temporarily gave them to An Sheng to protect himself.</p>
<p>If something really happened, An Sheng would have the ability to adapt and handle the situation with five Terror-grade Golden Battle Gods in hand.</p>
<p>“Young Master, don’t worry. As long as I’m still around, I won’t let anyone trample over Luoyang,” An Sheng said solemnly.</p>
<p>“I’m not An Tianzuo. Why are you telling me this? Don’t force things. If things go south, run. Take Sis Lan and my father with you. Luoyang isn’t that important to me,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Okay, I understand.” An Sheng nodded.</p>
<p>Time was of the essence. They had to figure out the origins of the Calamity creature as soon as possible to make targeted preparations. Only then could they stand a chance of surviving the calamity.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen left Overseer Manor with Sweetie and took a detour to the dungeon.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In a yard outside Luoyang City, Hermit was leisurely drinking tea.</p>
<p>“I’ve already checked. As you said, the origin of the Calamity is the Capital of the Gods,” Cave Era said with a look of delight when she returned.</p>
<p>Hermit smiled and said, “Speaking of which, it was all thanks to luck. Back then, I accidentally entered the Capital of the Gods and saw something unbelievable. I had an inkling that something had happened in the Capital of the Gods recently, but I never really expected it to be the case.”</p>
<p>Cave Era said, “With the information we have on hand, it won’t be difficult for us to make a deal with the An family or Zhou Wen. This information is enough for the An family to survive the calamity. I believe they will be tempted.”</p>
<p>“So what if I make a deal with them? Can we get that Heavenly Robe? If the An family is destroyed, won’t the effect be better than obtaining the Heavenly Robe?” Hermit’s eyes shimmered with a strange glint.</p>
<p>Cave Era was slightly taken aback as she looked at Hermit and said, “Even if the information is accurate, it will at most deal a heavy blow to Luoyang. It probably won’t be that easy to destroy the An family and Sunset College’s Leng Zongzheng, right?”</p>
<p>“What if we secretly give it a push?” Hermit said with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>Cave Era fell into deep thought as she considered the feasibility of this matter.</p>
<p>“Think about it. As long as the An family falls, we don’t have to worry about the threat of that cannon. We can also finish off troublesome fellows like Leng Zongzheng and Zhou Wen. Furthermore, we don’t have to do all of this ourselves. All we need to do is secretly push for it to happen. Is there a better chance than this? It’s not too much to say that it’s a rare opportunity,” Hermit persuaded.</p>
<p>To guide a Calamity-grade creature to destroy Luoyang, he still needed to use the temporal powers of Cave Era.</p>
<p>“Are you confident?” Cave Era was somewhat tempted.</p>
<p>“I need your help. I also need another person.” Hermit seemed to have thought it through.</p>
<p>“Who?” Cave Era was somewhat curious. If it was a member of the League of Guardians, Hermit would have directly taken the person with him. From his tone, he wasn’t a member of the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>“The Special Investigation Bureau’s director-general,” Hermit said.</p>
<p>Cave Era was slightly taken aback. “Wei Ge? He’s only at the Epic stage. The Guardian he contracted is only at the Mythical stage, and one that was teleported over using the Skysplit Tower. What can he do that the members of our League of Guardians can’t?”</p>
<p>Hermit explained, “Wei Ge is a very utilitarian person. He has been unscrupulous in his climb up the ranks. In the past few years, our League of Guardians has been able to firmly control the Federation’s Senate. This person’s ruthlessness was indispensable. Furthermore, he has one ability that others don’t.”</p>
<p>“What ability?” Cave Era was somewhat puzzled. She didn’t remember what special abilities the Guardian that Wei Ge had contracted had. It was only a very ordinary fire-elemental Guardian. Back then, the fire-elemental Guardian had been given to him by the League of Guardians to win Wei Ge over.. Cave Era knew very well what abilities it had.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1360'>Chapter 1360: The Monarch Bee of People</h3>
<p>“He knows how to use people,” Hermit said.</p>
<p>“How so?” Cave Era knew that using people sounded simple, but it depended on how they were used and who was used.</p>
<p>“He has a nickname, Monarch Bee. Do you know what that nickname means?” Hermit asked.</p>
<p>“Isn’t his intelligence network as dense as a bee’s hive?” Cave Era had also heard of Wei Ge’s nickname.</p>
<p>“That’s only a part of it. In fact, the reason he has the nickname of Monarch Bee wasn’t because of his intelligence network, but because of his ability to control his subordinates.” Hermit looked at a honey bee that flew into flower shrubs at the corner of the yard and said meaningfully, “With the existence of the Monarch Bee, all the bees will offer everything they have to the Monarch Bee. They will not betray him even if they die.”</p>
<p>Cave Era traced Hermit’s gaze and looked at the bee. For some reason, she felt a chill.</p>
<p>There was only one queen bee in a hive. Be it the soldier or worker bees, they only served the queen bee. They were willing to give up everything, even their lives. They didn’t have a life of their own at all, as though they were born to serve the queen bee.</p>
<p>However, humans weren’t bees. They had their own desires and selfishness, but for there to be people who treated Wei Ge as a monarch bee, just the thought of it made one’s heart turn cold. It was difficult to imagine what methods Wei Ge had employed to make his subordinates offer up so much that it seemed against humanity.</p>
<p>“Before Wei Ge, there were many spies for the various families in the bureau, but ever since Wei Ge became director-general, the spies of the various families came under his employ. The entire bureau slowly became Wei Ge’s hive.” Hermit’s words were filled with admiration.</p>
<p>“How did he do it?” Cave Era hadn’t paid much attention to the bureau.</p>
<p>From her point of view, the bureau was just a tool. Just like a police hound, they could be replaced.</p>
<p>However, after hearing Hermit’s words, Cave Era felt for the first time that Director-General Wei was really a capable fellow.</p>
<p>A fellow who had only contracted a Mythical Guardian was actually able to firmly hold the bureau in his grasp. Even the six families, who had treated the bureau as their eyes and ears, could no longer extend their tentacles into the bureau. This wasn’t something an ordinary person could do.</p>
<p>“That’s because everyone has a weakness and has something they are afraid of. No one is better at using others’ weaknesses than Wei Ge. If there’s really a devil in this world, Wei Ge will definitely be the most vicious one.”</p>
<p>Hermit continued, “Previously, Lord Immortal gave Wei Ge two choices. One was to contract the Terror-grade Guardian, Ice Demon, while the other was to contract the Mythical Balrog. Although Ice Demon was at the Terror grade, that was the limit to his potential. He couldn’t advance any further. As for Balrog, although it was only at the Mythical stage, there was a possibility of advancing further. The Terror grade isn’t the end. Although the chances of advancing are very low, Wei Ge still chose to contract Balrog. From this, one can tell how ambitious this person is.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, he still fell into Lord Immortal’s scheme. Balrog does have a possibility of advancing further, but he has a flaw that’s not considered a flaw. Ignoring advancing to the Calamity grade, even advancing to the Terror grade is extremely difficult. It’s almost impossible for him to advance to the Terror grade on Earth. That’s also the reason Wei Ge’s Balrog hasn’t advanced to the Terror grade yet.”</p>
<p>Cave Era nodded. “I know about that. Lord Immortal felt that this person was too vicious and was afraid that he would have ulterior motives, so he used such a blatant scheme. Wei Ge naturally knows that it won’t be easy for Balrog to advance to the Calamity grade, but his greed made him make such a choice. It’s not anyone’s fault.”</p>
<p>“Wei Ge hasn’t advanced to the Terror grade, but some of his subordinates have already obtained Terror-grade Guardians. There are even some who advanced to the Terror grade through the Mythical Serum. However, the director-general of the bureau is still Wei Ge, not the Terror-grade ones whose strength is above him. What do you think?” Hermit said.</p>
<p>“This person really can’t be underestimated.” Cave Era agreed with Hermit.</p>
<p>“To lure a Calamity-grade creature to appear and destroy Luoyang, I need the help of a Terror-grade from the bureau. And that person only obeys Wei Ge’s orders, so I need Wei Ge. Of course, he doesn’t only have one subordinate. And we also need some cannon fodder. If we use them as cannon fodder, there’s no need to use our own people. Isn’t it better to use the people from the bureau?” Hermit said.</p>
<p>“Would a person like him be willing to do something so damaging to himself?” Cave Era frowned.</p>
<p>“A person like him would sacrifice everything for himself. If I tell him that I can help him advance Balrog to the Terror grade, he would probably even sell his father to me, much less his subordinates,” Hermit said with a smile.</p>
<p>“If I remember correctly, Wei Ge also came from Sunset College. Aren’t you afraid that there’s something wrong with him?” Cave Era asked.</p>
<p>“Over the past few years, this Director-General Wei’s hands have been stained with the blood of the Sunset Army. He was the one who personally wiped out the An family’s intelligence network in Holy City. The An family hates him to the core. Of course, it’s not just the An family. In fact, other than our League of Guardians, the six families and many wealthy families wish to rip him to pieces. He has no way out and can only be our dog,” Hermit said.</p>
<p>“In that case, call him over.” Cave Era nodded slightly. In fact, although she wasn’t in charge of such matters, she had heard of Director Wei’s style of doing things. She didn’t find it problematic.</p>
<p>“He won’t work for us so easily. I still have to make a trip personally and let him see hope.” As Hermit spoke, he stood up and extended his hand to suck the bee into his palm. He crushed it to dust and scattered it in the wind.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen rushed to the dungeon with Sweetie. However, there were too many dungeons, and not all the entrances were in one place. After some thought, he decided to visit Luoyi City.</p>
<p>It was the dimensional zone that was closest to the Mythical era period-wise. If there was no problem there, he could head to the nearest Yang City.</p>
<p>As for the Capital of the Gods, there didn’t seem to be any existences that could become Calamity-grade existences in that era. As for the First Empress, she probably hadn’t reached that level.</p>
<p>Luoyi City was ancient and eerie, like the Shinra Temple in hell. Zhou Wen had never been here before. He had only heard from An Sheng that many humans who had come here to explore had failed to return alive.</p>
<p>Those who fortunately escaped only saw the periphery of the city. They said that there was a terrifying, invisible force in the city that killed many of their companions.</p>
<p>Now that he thought about it, it was definitely an existence above the Terror grade, but he didn’t know what level it was.</p>
<p>However, with Sweetie by his side, Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of a Calamity-grade creature. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have rashly come here.</p>
<p>When he was outside the city gates, Zhou Wen first searched to see if there was a tiny palm symbol that allowed him to download the dungeon. However, after circling the area, he didn’t find one.</p>
<p>“What are you looking for?” Sweetie asked in puzzlement when she saw Zhou Wen wandering around the city gates without entering.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1361'>Chapter 1361: Lady in the City</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“To see if there are any baddies,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you a baddie?” Sweetie looked at Zhou Wen and asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“To see if there’s anyone worse than me,” Zhou Wen explained casually before walking towards the gates of Luoyi City.</p>
<p>“Probably not,” Sweetie muttered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say a word. When he looked up at the city gates, he suddenly saw a woman standing on them. The woman was staring at him expressionlessly. She looked extremely beautiful, but her coldness was terrifying.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed. He had just looked at the city gates moments ago and hadn’t discovered anyone. Now that a woman had suddenly appeared, he couldn’t help but focus his gaze on her.</p>
<p>However, he realized that the woman standing on the city gate had vanished. Zhou Wen thought he was seeing things.</p>
<p>He rubbed his eyes and took a closer look. There was indeed nothing on the city gates.</p>
<p>“Did you see a person?” Zhou Wen asked Sweetie.</p>
<p>“I didn’t see a person,” Sweetie answered.</p>
<p>Could it be that I was seeing things? Just as Zhou Wen was feeling puzzled, he heard Sweetie continue, “I only saw a beautiful dimensional creature.”</p>
<p>The corners of Zhou Wen’s eyes twitched as he held back the urge to lash out at her. “That dimensional creature looks like a woman and is wearing strange clothes…”</p>
<p>After Sweetie listened attentively, she nodded and said, “It’s her. You saw her too. Why are you asking me?”</p>
<p>“Did you see where she went?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“She went down the city gate from that spot,” Sweetie answered.</p>
<p>That woman’s speed is so fast that I can’t see her trajectory. Could she be a Calamity? Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Sweetie could see her. This meant that the other party’s ability didn’t exceed Sweetie’s. This relieved Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Could the Calamity that’s about to appear be that woman? Zhou Wen thought as he pushed open the gates and walked into Luoyi City.</p>
<p>The scene in the city left him alarmed. There was a straight main street leading from the city gate, but there were no living creatures on the street.</p>
<p>The only things he could see were many soldier corpses and destroyed buildings. The already ghastly Luoyi City looked more like a Shinra Ghost Domain.</p>
<p>The soldiers had died in very different ways. Some had sabers plunged into them, sticking them to the walls, some had their heads chopped off, and some had been crushed to death by wheels. The entire city was filled with dead soldiers.</p>
<p>Although he hadn’t experienced the battle, he could imagine how tragic the battle had been just from the scene of the aftermath.</p>
<p>Not far from Zhou Wen were two standing ancient soldiers. One of them had stabbed the other through the throat, while the other soldier’s sword had penetrated his heart. The two of them provided each one support as they stood there, dead.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen scanned his surroundings the entire time, but he didn’t find any traces of the woman. All he could do was ask Sweetie again.</p>
<p>“Over there.” Sweetie pointed deep into the ancient city where he could vaguely see the palace-like buildings.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen blinked and in a few flashes, he was close. He saw a long stone staircase that led to the entrance of the palace-like hall.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen see a woman advancing on the stone steps. As he could only see her back and robe, Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if this woman was the woman he had seen on the city gate tower.</p>
<p>However, the situation in Luoyi City was different from the information An Sheng had obtained. Zhou Wen was already beginning to suspect that the Calamity-grade dimensional creature that was about to appear was in Luoyi City. Furthermore, it was very likely the woman in front of him.</p>
<p>The woman on the steps walked very slowly. Her long robe was dragged over the steps. Her back was beautiful.</p>
<p>Thinking of her face, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but feel a little regretful. Although she’s very beautiful, she’s just too cold. It makes it difficult for people to get close to her.</p>
<p>The woman didn’t seem to know of Zhou Wen’s arrival as she slowly walked towards the palace. The flight of stairs was long. She walked up step by step like an ordinary person. It would probably take her quite some time to reach the palace.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you curious what she’s doing?” Zhou Wen turned around and asked Sweetie, hoping that she could go over and see what was going on.</p>
<p>“Isn’t she just heading back to her room to get some rest? What’s there to be curious about?” Sweetie asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was rendered speechless. All he could do was stand at the bottom of the steps and watch the woman slowly walk up. He didn’t dare rashly head up.</p>
<p>After walking for a while, the woman finally reached the top of the stairs and arrived in front of the palace.</p>
<p>She stood at the top of the steps and slowly turned around. Zhou Wen immediately felt his eyes light up. It was an extremely beautiful face. Indeed, it was the person he had seen on the city gate tower.</p>
<p>Apart from her cold expression, she was indeed a peerless beauty.</p>
<p>The moment she stood on the steps, shouts suddenly shook the firmaments from the originally silent Luoyi City.</p>
<p>The soldier corpses everywhere in the city seemed to revive as they stood up. They held their weapons and looked at Zhou Wen with dull eyes.</p>
<p>“Charge!” Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. Before he could think carefully, he heard shouts and killing intent.</p>
<p>Then, he saw the ancient soldiers rush towards him from all directions.</p>
<p>Seeing the ancient soldiers reaching him, Zhou Wen waved his hand and immediately reduced the group of ancient soldiers to dust.</p>
<p>These ancient soldiers’ levels weren’t high. Most of them were at the Legendary stage. Occasionally, some generals would be at the Epic stage. Such a level was nothing in front of Zhou Wen. He could kill a row of them with a finger.</p>
<p>However, the ancient soldiers charged forward fearlessly. No matter how many Zhou Wen killed, there were more ancient soldiers that replaced their fallen ranks.</p>
<p>As he had killed so many ancient soldiers, a large number of dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs dropped to the ground. However, their levels were too low for Zhou Wen to bother picking them up.</p>
<p>Why are the levels of the ancient soldiers here so low? If this is really the birthplace of Calamity-grade creatures, shouldn’t there be many Mythical and even Terror-grade creatures appearing? These are all at the Legendary and Epic stage, other than their huge numbers. It doesn’t look like the scene predating a Calamity-grade creature’s appearance. Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>“You’re indeed a big baddie. Why did you kill them for no reason?” Sweetie suddenly said unhappily.</p>
<p>“If they want to kill me, why can’t I kill them?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“But they don’t want to kill you,” Sweetie said with a frown.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he suddenly recalled the feeling that something was amiss. He stopped attacking.</p>
<p>The moment Zhou Wen stopped, the soldiers immediately charged forward like a tidal wave. They quickly rushed in front of him, but they didn’t attack him. They ignored him and charged past him like rapids.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately realized that their target wasn’t him, but the peerless beauty standing at the top of the stone steps.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1362'>Chapter 1362: Mud City</h3>
<p>The horde of ancient soldiers resembling ants rushed up the steps, towards the beauty standing at the end of the stairs. It was as if the beauty had an endless grudge with them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was dumbfounded. It wasn’t like he had never seen dimensional creatures fight dimensional creatures before, but to ignore humans who had killed many of their kind and risk their lives to kill another dimensional creature was a first for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>As there were too many soldiers charging at him, Zhou Wen had no choice but to fly into the air and watch them swarm forward.</p>
<p>The few generals who were leading the charge were about to reach the top of the steps. They looked eager to leap up and stab the beautiful woman with all sorts of weapons.</p>
<p>The beautiful woman didn’t dodge despite facing the legion. She only looked at the soldiers indifferently as though all of this had nothing to do with her.</p>
<p>Just as the swords, sabers, spears, and halberds were about to stab the beauty, the door to the palace behind her suddenly opened. A bright divine light shot out from inside. The ancient soldiers immediately disintegrated when they came into contact with the divine light.</p>
<p>The beauty remained motionless. Her back was facing the divine light, like a fairy bathed in the morning light.</p>
<p>The ant-like ancient soldiers were akin to ghosts encountering light as they screamed and turned to dust. Instantly, gray smoke rose everywhere in Luoyi City. The scene was eerie, bizarre, and spectacular.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gathered his strength to resist the dazzling divine light, but he realized that the divine light didn’t affect him at all.</p>
<p>Sweetie stood there without any intention of resisting the divine light. Similarly, she was fine.</p>
<p>The woman bathed in divine light glanced at Zhou Wen and Sweetie before turning to walk into the palace.</p>
<p>“Are you about to be unleashed onto the world?” Zhou Wen pondered for a moment and asked.</p>
<p>With Sweetie by his side, if he didn’t ask her now, it would be useless asking her alone in the future.</p>
<p>The woman stopped, but she didn’t turn around. She only stood in the brilliant divine light and said, “If I were to be unleashed, it wouldn’t just be such a scene.”</p>
<p>With that said, the woman walked through the door. The door creaked and automatically closed, cutting off the world inside the palace from the outside.</p>
<p>Without the light, Luoyi City immediately became eerie and terrifying. The ancient soldiers in the distance, that weren’t illuminated by the divine light, seemed to finally regain their rationality. After discovering Zhou Wen, they roared and charged forward.</p>
<p>The ordinary ancient soldiers were at most at the Mythical stage, so Zhou Wen didn’t take them to heart. With a casual wave of his hand, he reduced the approaching ancient soldiers to dust. Many dimensional crystals dropped.</p>
<p>What does that woman mean? If she were to be unleashed, it wouldn’t be such a scene? From what she’s saying, it doesn’t seem like she’s going to be released. However, there’s something very problematic with what she’s saying. Does she mean that if she were to appear, the disaster would be even more terrifying? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but worry.</p>
<p>The birth of a Calamity had already plunged Luoyang into a deep abyss. If another one were to appear, Zhou Wen felt that his days would really be numbered.</p>
<p>There’s not much to say about Luoyang. There are too many legends and too many dangers, Zhou Wen thought to himself as he glanced at Sweetie. Seeing that she was indifferent, there was nothing he could do.</p>
<p>He wanted Sweetie to help him kill the woman and even rush into the palace to purge all the dimensional creatures inside so as to eliminate this future threat.</p>
<p>However, Sweetie wasn’t at his beck and call. She even had a grudge with him. Zhou Wen could only sigh helplessly.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, the dimensional zone where the Calamity creature will be unleashed isn’t this,” Sweetie said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up when he heard Sweetie. “If we find the released Calamity creature, will you help me eliminate it?”</p>
<p>“Of course not,” Sweetie immediately answered with certainty and without any hesitation.</p>
<p>“You are so kind. Can you bear to see the Calamity creature appear and cause suffering and misery?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“This is a natural law. Don’t you humans brutally kill many dimensional creatures? You even have to eat large numbers of creature corpses every day. According to your logic, I should kill all of you humans first to prevent any suffering and misery,” Sweetie said seriously.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was momentarily rendered speechless. After some thought, he realized that she wasn’t wrong.</p>
<p>If humans could hunt other creatures, why couldn’t dimensional creatures hunt humans?</p>
<p>After taking a deep look at the tightly shut door of the palace, Zhou Wen turned around and walked out of Luoyi City. He knew very well what was happening.</p>
<p>If he wanted to stay in Luoyang in the future, he would probably have to face the horror and the woman in Luoyi City sooner or later.</p>
<p>After leaving Luoyi City, Zhou Wen went to Yang City that was relatively close.</p>
<p>Yang City was at the bottom of the dungeon. None of the known dungeons were deeper than Yang City.</p>
<p>Legend had it that Yang City had once been the capital of Yu the Great. Instead of saying that Yu the Great was human, it was more accurate to say that it was a myth or legend.</p>
<p>The legend of Yu the Great’s control of waters was known by everyone in the East District. Zhou Wen had naturally heard the stories from his grandfather when he was young.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen even guessed that Yu the Great’s control of waters was likely related to the prehistoric flood.</p>
<p>According to the information Zhou Wen now had, the continent was a whole back then. In order to find Earth’s strongest Companion Beast, a dimensional ship had torn through the air and plunged through the continent to enter the depths of Earth.</p>
<p>As for the continent, it had been torn apart due to the heavy damage, forming the four major districts.</p>
<p>The four districts all had legends of a prehistoric flood. Zhou Wen felt that it wasn’t a coincidence.</p>
<p>Sometimes, Zhou Wen wondered if the flood regarding Yu the Great was really related to that flood. If it were true, things wouldn’t be as simple as he imagined.</p>
<p>The battles of Zhuolu and the Investiture of the Gods were indeed the most famous legendary battles in the East District.</p>
<p>However, if one thought about it carefully, it seemed to be a very well-concealed legendary war. For some reason, the details hadn’t been passed down.</p>
<p>During Yu the Great’s control of the water, he led the human clans, splitting mountains and rivers along the way, slaying countless terrifying creatures. If the legend was true, where did those terrifying creatures come from? Why did Yu the Great have the ability to kill them?</p>
<p>In the myths that Zhou Wen knew, the Godly Sea Steadying Needle used by the Monkey King was a tool that Yu the Great had used to measure the water’s depth.</p>
<p>The legendary Godly Sea Steadying Needle weighed 13,500 jin. It was impossible for an ordinary person to lift it, much less use it to measure the depth of the water.</p>
<p>It was an unsettling thought. Zhou Wen felt even more reverent towards the Yang City dimensional zone. If Sweetie hadn’t been with him, he wouldn’t have dared enter regardless.</p>
<p>He arrived at the deepest dungeon in Yang City. It was somewhat different from what Zhou Wen had imagined. This city wasn’t built with bricks or rock, but a mud city.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1363'>Chapter 1363: Unable to Snap Photos</h3>
<p>The city walls of Yang City were basically made of clay bricks, but they looked extremely hard. The red-yellow clay bricks seemed rather hard. Although they had been through the ravages of time, they only appeared mottled. The entire structure looked extremely strong, giving it a simple and grand aura.</p>
<p>“There’s something iffy about this place,” Sweetie suddenly said before Zhou Wen could approach the Yang City gates.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he turned to look at Sweetie. He saw her staring at the Yang City door with a look of disgust.</p>
<p>“How so? Is there danger inside?” Zhou Wen was secretly alarmed. Sweetie was God. If even God felt that it was dangerous, then Yang City was probably even more terrifying than he imagined.</p>
<p>“No, I just sense an irritating aura,” Sweetie said after some thought.</p>
<p>“An irritating aura? What do you mean?” As Zhou Wen spoke, he carefully sized up Yang City.</p>
<p>The architectural style of Yang City could be considered crude and spartan from a modern perspective.</p>
<p>A large number of buildings were made of clay. From the outside, one could vaguely see the roofs of some wooden buildings, but they didn’t look exquisite. Most of them were ancient and simple.</p>
<p>Truth Listener’s ability couldn’t extend into Yang City. All it could do was observe its external appearance.</p>
<p>There was redness in the clay bricks and a faint fragrance. Zhou Wen sniffed carefully and confirmed that the very faint fragrance was coming from the clay bricks and not the wood.</p>
<p>“Are you talking about the smell in the mud city walls?” Zhou Wen asked Sweetie.</p>
<p>He also felt a little uneasy, but if the Calamity creature was really born in Yang City, he could only enter to take a look.</p>
<p>Of course, that was under the premise that Sweetie was willing to enter. If she wasn’t willing to enter, Zhou Wen planned on returning.</p>
<p>In a land that even God wasn’t willing to step into, Zhou Wen wasn’t so fearless as to sacrifice himself.</p>
<p>“No, there’s something in the city that I hate,” said Sweetie.</p>
<p>“What is it? A creature or something?” Zhou Wen continued asking.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Anyway, I don’t like it.” Sweetie looked at Yang City in disgust. She didn’t seem to want to look at it a second time.</p>
<p>Sweetie only said that she didn’t like it, making Zhou Wen feel a little more at ease. Although Sweetie didn’t like looking at Yang City, he carefully sized it up again and again.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up. In front of the mud city gate was an erected log. He originally imagined that it was a flag pole.</p>
<p>On closer inspection, he realized that there was a tiny palm symbol engraved on the log.</p>
<p>I’ve finally found it! Zhou Wen didn’t wish to enter Yang City to begin with. Now that he had found the tiny palm symbol, there was no need for him to take the risk. He could download Yang City and slowly grind when he returned.</p>
<p>“Stand over there,” Zhou Wen said as he pointed at the log.</p>
<p>“What for?” Sweetie looked over. There was only a log, nothing else.</p>
<p>“I’ll take a picture for you as a commemoration.” Zhou Wen picked up his ordinary phone and took a picture of Sweetie.</p>
<p>“What’s taking pictures?” Sweetie asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“It’s leaving your appearance on the phone…” Before Zhou Wen could finish his sentence, he realized that he couldn’t continue because he couldn’t snap a picture of Sweetie on his phone.</p>
<p>“You used your Terror form?” Zhou Wen asked Sweetie.</p>
<p>“No.” Sweetie shook her head.</p>
<p>“That’s strange. Why can’t I take a picture of you?” Zhou Wen attempted to take another picture, but the outcome was the same. It was as though Sweetie didn’t exist. Apart from Sweetie, there was everything else in the picture.</p>
<p>“Why do you take photos?” Sweetie looked at the photo taken on Zhou Wen’s phone and roughly understood what a photo was.</p>
<p>“There are many reasons. Most of them are for the sake of retaining beautiful scenes. For example, when one encounters a beautiful scene, he wants to take a picture to let himself see it in the future. Or perhaps it’s something that’s very meaningful. For example, when a child is young, his parents would take pictures of him. When he grows up, he can still see his childhood. Or perhaps it’s a couple taking pictures of each other. When they have no choice but to separate, they can take a look at each other’s pictures when they miss each other…” Zhou Wen explained.</p>
<p>“I see. Then take another picture for me.” Sweetie’s interest seemed piqued.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a few more photos of Sweetie, but the outcome was the same. No matter how many photos he took, Sweetie couldn’t be captured.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took the opportunity to snap a picture of the tiny palm symbol with his mysterious phone before putting it away to slowly download the dungeon.</p>
<p>Sweetie seemed to be trying as well. She tried to let herself be captured, but it was completely impossible. Even if she restrained her strength, she still couldn’t be captured.</p>
<p>“I remember now. Ghosts can’t be captured by cameras.” Sweetie wanted to continue trying, but Zhou Wen was tired of taking pictures. He hadn’t wanted to take pictures of Sweetie to begin with. He was just afraid that Sweetie would be interested in his snapping of the tiny palm symbol. He just wanted to mislead her.</p>
<p>“No, I have to take a picture.” Sweetie was pumped. She wanted Zhou Wen to give her the phone so that she could take a picture herself.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, Thankfully, I was afraid that my phone would be damaged so I stocked up quite a number of phones in the chaos space.</p>
<p>He handed a phone to Sweetie. While watching Zhou Wen operate it, she had already learned how to take pictures. She let the phone hang in the air as she took pictures of herself.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to go through so much trouble. There’s a front-facing camera installed in your phone. You just need to switch to the selfie mode.” Zhou Wen walked over and taught Sweetie how to take selfies on her phone.</p>
<p>Sweetie naturally learned it quickly, but the photos she took didn’t show her body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen waited for a while. Seeing that the dungeon hadn’t been downloaded, he planned on returning. He still had some places he hadn’t been to.</p>
<p>Before he could persuade Sweetie, he saw a figure rushing over.</p>
<p>“Thank heavens I’ve finally found you, Young Master Wen. Adjutant An told me to find you and tell you to return immediately.” The person was an officer traveling at extremely fast speeds. Beneath the military cap was a pair of wolf ears. He had probably advanced to the Mythical stage using a wolf-type Mythical Serum.</p>
<p>“Something happened in Luoyang?” Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>“No, Adjutant An told me to tell you not to worry. It’s fine at home, but you have to return immediately. He has something important to discuss with you,” the officer said as he panted.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen turned around and left. An Sheng knew the reason for him being here, but he was in such a rush to send someone to him. Clearly, it was an emergency.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen got back, Hermit, Cave Era, and company were already in the dimensional zone in the Capital of the Gods. Furthermore, they had ventured rather deep.</p>
<p>“Director-General Wei, it’s up to your bureau next,” Hermit said to Wei Ge, who was standing beside him in front of a strange building that was as huge as a tower.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1364'>Chapter 1364: Evil is One Thought Away From Good</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“Follow the plan,” Wei Ge ordered expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“Yes.” A few Censors from the bureau carefully walked towards the tower.</p>
<p>Hermit and Cave Era watched from the side. Only after the Censors entered the tower did Cave Era look at Wei Ge and say, “Director-General Wei, those are likely the capable generals of the bureau, right? If they were to die here, the bureau would probably suffer heavy losses.”</p>
<p>Wei Ge said respectfully, “Your Excellency, you are reading too much into it. As a Censor, they understand the Federation’s need for sacrifices. Furthermore, I’m very confident in my subordinates. They will definitely return safely.”</p>
<p>Cave Era and Hermit exchanged looks and didn’t say anything else.</p>
<p>In fact, they knew very well that it was impossible for the Censors to return. They were offerings to begin with. Only with their sacrifices could the plan continue.</p>
<p>Wei Ge knew this very well, but in order to advance his Guardian, he would rather have his subordinates die. Furthermore, he didn’t even blink. It was as though the deaths of his subordinates were no different from the death of an ant.</p>
<p>Cave Era found it difficult to understand how such a cold, selfish, and cruel fellow could make all the inspectors follow him loyally. Furthermore, they obeyed his orders wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>Not long after, they heard tragic cries coming from the tower. A strange light lit up at the top of the strange tower.</p>
<p>“It’s finally here…” Hermit looked at the light at the top of the tower as excitement flashed in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Is that the legendary Heaven?” Wei Ge narrowed his eyes as he looked at the gradually glowing tower and muttered to himself.</p>
<p>Hermit nodded and said, “That’s right. That place is indeed Heaven. The empress used Devas to sense the land where Buddha is worshiped. It’s known as the place closest to Heaven. There are also people who call him the Skysplit Buddha.”</p>
<p>Wei Ge stared at Heaven and continued asking, “According to what I know, that empress is only an ordinary human. No matter how honorable her status was back then, she shouldn’t have become an existence like an immortal or Buddha, right?”</p>
<p>“An empress of the human world really doesn’t have the right to become a Mythical, much less be an existence that can reach the Calamity grade after death.” Hermit paused and said, “But the one in Heaven isn’t that empress.”</p>
<p>“Not the empress?” Wei Ge was slightly taken aback, his face filled with puzzlement.</p>
<p>Be it Capital of the Gods or Heaven, they were both unique to the empress. It was hard to believe that the owner of this place wasn’t her.</p>
<p>Apart from her, who else had the right to claim sovereignty in the Capital of the Gods and occupy Heaven?</p>
<p>As the two of them spoke, the light in Heaven intensified, almost enveloping the huge tower-like Heaven.</p>
<p>Hermit was in a good mood as he stared at Heaven and explained, “No matter how strong a human is, they are at most Legendary or Epic. It’s impossible for them to advance to the Mythical stage. That empress is also a human, so she naturally won’t be an exception. Furthermore, even if she becomes a Mythical, it’s impossible for her to live to this day, much less advance to the Calamity grade.”</p>
<p>When Wei Ge heard Hermit’s words, he looked at the light around Heaven. It seemed to stir something in him, but he had no intention of saying it.</p>
<p>Hermit saw Wei Ge’s expression and knew that he had guessed something. Therefore, he said, “Since you have already thought of something, say it out and let me see if you are right.”</p>
<p>Wei Ge pondered for a moment before saying, “I heard that there’s a Buddha statue in Dragon Gate Grotto named Lochana Buddha. It’s carved with the likeness of the empress.”</p>
<p>Hermit immediately laughed when he heard Wei Ge say that. “You are indeed a smart person. Losana means shining light, and the name that the empress gave herself has the word Zhao. It basically has the same meaning as Lochana.”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>“So there’s really a Lochana Buddha in Heaven?” Wei Ge’s expression changed slightly.</p>
<p>If the person in heaven was really Lochana Buddha, it would be terrifying.</p>
<p>Buddha had three bodies, and Lochana Buddha was one of them. It was known as Reward Body Buddha, and it was an intelligent Buddha that signified absolute truth.</p>
<p>To put it in layman’s terms, the Lochana Buddha and the famous Gautama Buddha were two of the three Buddhas in one body. They could be considered one of the top Buddhas in Buddhism.</p>
<p>“Buddha has a benevolent heart. If it’s really Lochana Buddha, why would he need to use living people as a sacrifice?” Wei Ge felt that Hermit’s words were somewhat flawed.</p>
<p>“Director-General Wei, have you never heard of the saying that Buddha comes from the heart?” Hermit continued, “The so-called Buddha is a mirror, but this Buddha mirror reflects not a person but the heart. If you are kind-hearted, Buddha is good. If you are evil-hearted, Buddha is a hundred times more evil than you… Evil is just one thought away from good…”</p>
<p>Wei Ge said as though he had figured something out, “Therefore, if this Calamity creature were to appear peacefully, he might be a kind Buddha that won’t cause too much of a disaster?”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” Hermit said with a smile. “That’s naturally not what I want to see. Therefore, I got you to bring someone here to prevent him from becoming a kind Buddha. I need him to become a terrifying devil.”</p>
<p>As the two of them spoke, the Buddhistic glow in Heaven was so intense that it was unbearable to look at. There was a door opening, as though someone had walked out of Heaven.</p>
<p>Wei Ge focused his gaze. The person he discovered was a bhikkhuni wearing a white monk robe.</p>
<p>She walked over step by step as though cleansed the pure moonlight, she didn’t look like the devil Hermit had mentioned.</p>
<p>“She doesn’t look like a devil,” Wei Ge said as he looked at the bhikkhuni.</p>
<p>“Of course not. If she’s already a devil, we won’t be able to escape death,” Hermit said indifferently. “However, after she leaves the Capital of the Gods, she will definitely become a devil.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Wei Ge was even more puzzled.</p>
<p>“Because you are here.” Hermit laughed.</p>
<p>“Me?” Wei Ge was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>Hermit looked at Wei Ge and said, “Yes, it’s you. If your heart is like Buddha, Buddha will be here. If your heart is like a devil, the devil will naturally descend into this world. If a person with a devil’s heart like Director-General Wei were to have an affinity with that bhikkhuni, she would definitely become a devil…”</p>
<p>“What do you need me to do?” Wei Ge asked.</p>
<p>“Nothing at all. All you need to do is wait for her to leave the Capital of the Gods and let her see you.”</p>
<p>Seeing Wei Ge’s confused expression, Hermit said with a smile, “You don’t understand? Then don’t bother thinking about it. When the time comes, you will naturally understand. Let’s wait for her outside the Capital of the Gods.”</p>
<p>Cave Era had already activated her temporal powers to take Wei Ge and Hermit out of the Capital of the Gods.</p>
<p>As for the bhikkhuni, she continued walking forward slowly.. Wherever she passed, the ghost-like ancient soldiers turned back to dust as though they had been liberated.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1365'>Chapter 1365: Two Birds With One Stone</h3>
<p>“Director-General Wei, go. As long as you are in Luoyang, Luoyang will become a dead city. No one will be able to escape. Everyone will sense the brilliance of Buddha and be sent to Paradise,” Hermit said to Wei Ge as he looked at the ancient soldiers crawling out of the ground.</p>
<p>“Although I’m very willing to sacrifice my life for the Federation, I still wish to remain useful and dedicate my life to the Federation and you. Therefore, I still wish to return alive.” Wei Ge didn’t budge his feet at all.</p>
<p>Hermit knew that it was impossible to get Wei Ge to take such a risk if he couldn’t convince him. Therefore, he explained, “The Censors who sacrificed themselves to Buddha are all your men. You were also the one who gave the order to let them enter Heaven. By using them as sacrifices, the bhikkhuni, who has awakened, is already tainted by their obsession. Although they haven’t reached the point of becoming devils, a sliver of a catalyst has been planted. As for you, you are the person who can spark off the catalyst because of that obsession. Therefore, as long as you are in Luoyang City, the bhikkhuni will definitely go to Luoyang City. Once she sees you and senses you, a person ridden with sin, becoming a devil is inevitable.</p>
<p>“Of course, you don’t have to worry. I’ve already prepared a path of retreat for you. When the bhikkhuni becomes a devil, it will be time for you to retreat with your job done,” Hermit said as he looked at Cave Era.</p>
<p>Cave Era took out a pocket watch and handed it to Wei Ge. “This is a temporal pocket watch I made. After bhikkhuni becomes a devil, you can use it to return to a designated time and place I set—the headquarters of our League of Guardians.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Your Excellency Cave Era.” Wei Ge solemnly put away the pocket watch.</p>
<p>“Go. When I return to the headquarters, I’ll help your Balrog advance to the Terror grade. Your future achievements will be limitless,” Hermit said.</p>
<p>“I still have to thank the two of you for your help. I’ll go now.” Wei Ge took a few steps and suddenly turned his head. “Your Excellency, is there any taboo when using this temporal watch? I’m afraid I’ll use it wrongly later.”</p>
<p>“If you are worried, you can give it a try,” Cave Era said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Please enlighten me.” Wei Ge was very careful. How could he be careless in matters that determined life and death?</p>
<p>Cave Era gave him the usage details. Wei Ge pressed it and his body immediately vanished. After a few seconds, his figure appeared again.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency’s temporal powers are indeed divine. You can travel great distances in an instant. It’s like a god’s help,” praised Wei Ge.</p>
<p>“If there’s no problem, go quickly. The bhikkhuni is about to come out,” Cave Era said with a cold expression, as though she was very unhappy that Wei Ge hadn’t trusted her.</p>
<p>Wei Ge knew that she was unhappy, so he didn’t ask for a snub. He bowed and headed for Luoyang City.</p>
<p>After Wei Ge vanished into Luoyang City, Cave Era said, “You were right. This person is too cautious. Thankfully, the temporal pocket watch I gave him was real, or it would have been troublesome.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing wrong with the temporal pocket watch, right?” Hermit asked.</p>
<p>“No problem. Everything is under my control. Without my power to activate it, the temporal pocket watch is useless. It’s useless even if he has it. Furthermore, he can let me know his location.” Cave Era hesitated for a moment before saying, “Why must he die? Although such a person is very annoying, he’s indeed very useful.”</p>
<p>“If he doesn’t die at the hands of the bhikkhuni, how can she truly become a devil?” Hermit said indifferently. “He’s just a dog. As long as we are willing, there will be more people willing to work for us at any time. Furthermore, he’s too ambitious. It’s not suitable for such a person to stay in this position for long. Otherwise, the bureau will become his private property. Must we go through him when we use the bureau in the future?”</p>
<p>Cave Era thought that it made sense. From this operation, it could be seen that Wei Ge’s title of Monarch Bee was definitely not groundless.</p>
<p>The Censors were almost subservient to Wei Ge. They even went against their orders. Without Wei Ge’s orders, it would probably be difficult for them to do anything.</p>
<p>“This time, we can deal with the An family in Luoyang and reshuffle the bureau. It will be killing two birds with one stone. We should celebrate later,” Hermit said with a smile.</p>
<p>As the two of them spoke, the bhikkhuni had already walked out of the dungeon. At the instant she walked out, a large number of the undead crawled out of the ground in Luoyang.</p>
<p>Luoyang City was immediately thrown into pandemonium. The ancient soldiers outside could still withstand the attacks, but at their feet, many ancient soldiers suddenly crawled out. It immediately threw the Sunset Army into disarray. They began engaging in melee combat, and the battle situation became extremely tragic.</p>
<p>Just as Hermit had expected, the bhikkhuni headed for Luoyang City, as though she was pursuing Wei Ge.</p>
<p>Wherever she passed, the dead people who crawled out of the ground transformed into a Buddhistic glow that rose into the sky. Their faces revealed looks of relief as though they had been liberated.</p>
<p>As for the living people near her, they weren’t affected. When they saw this scene, the soldiers and experts guarding the city were overjoyed. They imagined that rescue had arrived.</p>
<p>“The present bhikkhuni will only redeem the dead, but after she becomes a devil, she will redeem the living as well. I hope they can still smile when that happens,” Hermit said indifferently.</p>
<p>“If An Tianzuo wasn’t so overbearing and domineering and ignorant of the times, he wouldn’t have implicated everyone in this city,” said Cave Era with a sigh.</p>
<p>“The success of a general is built up of ten thousand bones. Fate has never been one’s. If anything is to be blamed, blame them for following the wrong person,” Hermit said coldly and mercilessly.</p>
<p>The bhikkhuni walked towards Luoyang step by step. Large swaths of ancient soldiers were being sent to their deaths. When she arrived outside Luoyang City, people imagined that their savior had arrived. They opened the gates to welcome the bhikkhuni in.</p>
<p>“Humans are just that ignorant,” Hermit said with an odd expression.</p>
<p>After the bhikkhuni entered the city, the large number of undead that had crawled out of the ground was redeemed by her strength as they ascended to heaven. The pressure on them immediately decreased.</p>
<p>Although the power of the dead wasn’t enough to destroy Luoyang, they were everywhere. They could appear from anywhere, causing a huge impact on ordinary people. Even someone as strong as Li Xuan couldn’t ensure the safety of the entire Li family.</p>
<p>Many dead people crawled out from the ground. He couldn’t flatten the Li family’s residence with a single punch after all. Furthermore, many people from the Li family were fighting the dead.</p>
<p>The bhikkhuni’s power ignored everything and purified the dead, sending them to heaven. As for the living, they weren’t injured at all.</p>
<p>“Stay happy. The happier you are now, the more miserable you will cry in a while.” Hermit snorted coldly and asked Cave Era, “Where’s Wei Ge?”</p>
<p>“Somewhere closer to the back.” Cave Era sensed the location of the pocket watch.</p>
<p>“Why did he run so far?” Hermit frowned slightly.</p>
<p>“He probably doesn’t dare to approach Overseer Manor too closely for fear of being discovered. It’s good to be careful to prevent him from being discovered and chased out,” said Cave Era.</p>
<p>The two of them could only watch bhikkhuni walk across the streets and redeem large swaths of the undead. She walked faster and faster, and her strength increased. She was almost completely transformed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1366'>Chapter 1366: The Devil Who Wants to Annihilate the Devil</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>With the bhikkhuni making the trip, most of the undead in Luoyang City had been cleared. The remaining few who were relatively far away and hadn’t been cleared didn’t pose much of a threat.</p>
<p>“He’s almost there,” Cave Era said to Hermit as she sensed the location of the temporal pocket watch.</p>
<p>Hermit’s eyes were filled with excitement as though he was looking forward to seeing the process of the bhikkhuni becoming a devil.</p>
<p>Just as the bhikkhuni was about to reach Wei Ge, she suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>Here it comes! Hermit’s heart raced as adrenaline involuntarily pumped through his veins. His palms turned moist from excitement.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the bhikkhuni turned around without any warning and walked back the way she came.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? Isn’t Wei Ge there?” Hermit was slightly taken aback as he hurriedly asked Cave Era.</p>
<p>“He should be there… The temporal pocket watch is there…” Cave Era felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>“No, he’s not there,” Hermit said with certainty. He kept looking around, but he didn’t discover anything.</p>
<p>As for the bhikkhuni, she was getting faster and faster. She had already rushed out of Luoyang and was heading straight for them.</p>
<p>“Wei Ge, come out. I know you are here,” Hermit shouted with a frown.</p>
<p>“Since you know where I am, come over yourself.” Wei Ge’s voice came from behind them.</p>
<p>Hermit’s body was like a phantom as he shot out a cold beam. The cold beam shattered the forest, but Wei Ge was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency Hermit, that’s not right of you. You actually treat one of your own like this. From the looks of it, I should let you have my title of Monarch Bee.” Wei Ge’s voice came from another spot.</p>
<p>This time, Cave Era used Time Acceleration to reach the spot, but she still didn’t see anyone.</p>
<p>Hermit and Cave Era exchanged looks and saw the surprise in each other’s eyes.</p>
<p>It was impossible for Wei Ge to have such abilities. The Guardian, Balrog, he had contracted was fire-elemental. Its explosive strength was very potent, but it shouldn’t be good at speed.</p>
<p>“Balrog, come out,” Hermit shouted coldly.</p>
<p>Balrog was a Guardian who came from the League of Guardians. He was a member of the League of Guardians to begin with. Even if Wei Ge wanted to betray him, Balrog would still accept the order.</p>
<p>Without Balrog, Wei Ge was nothing.</p>
<p>“Are you looking for it?” Wei Ge’s voice sounded again, but this time, he walked out from behind a boulder.</p>
<p>He extended one hand and pointed his fingers at the sky. In his palm was a dancing, mysterious flame. The flame looked like an enchanting woman dancing. It exuded danger and mystery.</p>
<p>“Terror grade?” Hermit and Cave Era’s expressions changed when they saw the flames. Wei Ge had actually advanced Balrog to the Terror grade. This was originally impossible. Balrog’s weakness didn’t seem to be resolvable to date.</p>
<p>“Balrog, what are you doing? Immediately terminate the contract with Wei Ge.” Cave Era still wanted to order Balrog, but Balrog didn’t react at all. It continued dancing in Wei Ge’s palm.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to say another word. Why do you think I chose the Mythical Balrog? It’s not because she will be strong in the future, but because only then will I have a chance of controlling her. I like to be in control of everything,” Wei Ge said calmly.</p>
<p>“A pity. You did something dangerous that you can’t control,” Hermit said as a collapsible fan appeared in his hand. With a move of the fan, a fan-shaped beam shot at Wei Ge.</p>
<p>Wei Ge retracted his fingers as the flames in his palm shattered, turning into purple flames that enveloped his body.</p>
<p>At that moment, the beam had already arrived in front of him. Beams of light shot into the purple flames, boring open huge holes through the humanoid figure inside, but there weren’t any of Wei Ge’s tragic cries.</p>
<p>Soon, the purple flames returned to their humanoid form. They appeared like a fluid purple-flamed robe that Wei Ge donned.</p>
<p>“The first impression flames give is heat and explosion, but that’s not all of it. Flames also have a gentle side.” As Wei Ge spoke, Cave Era had already used Time Acceleration to appear in front of him. With her hands and feet, she struck Wei Ge repeatedly with Terror-grade power.</p>
<p>Wei Ge’s body swayed like flames as he dodged Cave Era’s extremely fast attack. The attack that he couldn’t dodge struck Wei Ge, but it only shook the flames and quickly returned to its original state.</p>
<p>Wei Ge seemed to be dancing a gorgeous tango amidst the flames. Hermit and Cave Era’s combined attacks failed to injure him at all.</p>
<p>The flames were like nothingness and didn’t have any strength. Any force that struck it only made the flames bend around and not injure him.</p>
<p>“I only extracted the nothingness of fire, not its fiery intensity. I do what’s unexpected. Even you won’t be able to harm me after I turn into nothingness,” Wei Ge said calmly.</p>
<p>“Why have you betrayed us?” Hermit knew that he had to finish off Wei Ge before the bhikkhuni arrived. Otherwise, once she came, she would become a devil upon approaching Wei Ge. When that happened, even they would probably perish.</p>
<p>“The temporal pocket watch you gave me can’t save my life,” Wei Ge said.</p>
<p>“If you betrayed us because of this, we can negotiate nicely. Now that you have the right to negotiate with us, you can naturally receive the treatment you deserve. In the future, the league will still need talent like you,” Hermit said.</p>
<p>“I’m just telling you that I know of this matter, but that isn’t the cause.” Wei Ge directly denied Hermit.</p>
<p>“Then what’s the reason?” Cave Era couldn’t help but ask. She originally imagined that Wei Ge had betrayed them because he knew of their plan.</p>
<p>Wei Ge looked up at the starry sky and said, “Because from the beginning, I was just a devil who wanted to destroy devils.”</p>
<p>“Haha, what a joke. Aren’t your hands stained with human blood? Are you going to tell me that you are actually a good person?” Hermit laughed.</p>
<p>Wei Ge said indifferently, “I’ve never been a good person. I’m just a devil who likes to play games with devils. Now, it’s time to end this game.”</p>
<p>“You’re right. It’s time to end this game.” Hermit took a step forward. The surrounding mountain ranges, forests, and rivers suddenly lit up.</p>
<p>The matter in the natural world—mountains, rivers, wind, and fire—actually formed a formation similar to the Eight Trigrams.</p>
<p>“Do you think I came to Luoyang without making any preparations? I originally left a backup plan to deal with An Tianzuo and Zhou Wen, but now, I’ll use it on you. Wind, fire, and everything in the world are in my Myriad Form Eight Trigrams Array. Even if you turn into nothingness, flames need a medium. A flame wisp like yours won’t be able to escape my Myriad Form Eight Trigrams Array. It will only lead to destruction!” Accompanying Hermit’s voice, the surrounding mountains and rivers lit up. The power formed by everything surrounded Wei Ge from all directions.</p>
<p>“Have you ever heard of a single spark wrecking a plain?” The flaming muslin over Wei Ge’s body fluttered like the purple flames of a bonfire that surged into the sky.. It was beautiful and dangerous.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1367'>Chapter 1367: Becoming a Devil or Buddha?</h3>
<p>The flames on the muslin robe turned into butterflies that flew out. Everything that touched the flames burned. The surroundings instantly turned into a purple flaming world: flaming forest, flaming rivers, flaming mountains—everything was ignited. The original Myriad Form Eight Trigrams Array had turned into a pure flaming array.</p>
<p>Hermit’s expression changed drastically as he attempted to stop the Myriad Form Eight Trigrams Array from circulating, but he realized that it was completely useless. It brought with it endless energy, making it unstoppable.</p>
<p>Seeing that the bhikkhuni was already approaching, Hermit and Cave Era attempted to rush out, but they realized that they were trapped in the Myriad Form Eight Trigrams Array. Unable to rush out, they were truly trapped.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you just say that the Myriad Form Eight Trigrams Array contains all matter in the world? Your strength is naturally included, so you can’t leave either. Don’t you remember what you said?” Wei Ge said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Wei Ge, why aren’t you uncasting your fire powers to escape? After the bhikkhuni becomes a devil, the first person to be killed will be you,” Hermit said.</p>
<p>“Have you seen a devil who’s afraid of death? To have two of you die with me is considered a blessing for me,” Wei Ge said indifferently.</p>
<p>The bhikkhuni was close. Hermit and Cave Era couldn’t afford to waste any more time. They attacked Wei Ge with all their might, hoping to break through the array and escape.</p>
<p>However, Wei Ge’s Nihility Fire didn’t focus on powerful explosive strength. Instead, it focused on burning and nothingness. It took an unorthodox path and reached an extreme effect.</p>
<p>If it was a fair battle, Wei Ge might not be able to defeat Cave Era, but it wouldn’t be easy for them to injure Wei Ge.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they didn’t have the time. Cave Era and Hermit were alarmed and furious as they shouted, “Wei Ge, why aren’t you uncasting the array? Do you really want to die together?”</p>
<p>“What benefits will mutual destruction bring you? I’ll tell you a secret regarding Balrog, allowing your Balrog to really have a chance of advancing to the Calamity grade…”</p>
<p>“Open…”</p>
<p>The veins on Hermit’s forehead protruded as he roared.</p>
<p>However, Wei Ge remained unmoved. He danced in the flaming world like a flaming butterfly. No matter how terrifying Hermit and Cave Era’s attacks were, they couldn’t injure him at all.</p>
<p>At that moment, the bhikkhuni finally walked into the array, but the flames of the array were surprisingly unable to touch her robes. She walked all the way as though she was untainted by the mortal world.</p>
<p>It’s over! Hermit and Cave Era’s hearts turned cold.</p>
<p>However, Wei Ge remained calm as before. He transformed into flames and arrived near the bhikkhuni.</p>
<p>“Come. It’s extremely comforting to know that I’m lucky enough to let a Buddha degenerate into a devil.” Wei Ge spread open his hands and waited for the bhikkhuni to become a devil, like a devil lord who nurtured devils with blood.</p>
<p>Hermit and Cave Era were alarmed. Even they couldn’t completely suppress their fear of death.</p>
<p>The bhikkhuni was a Calamity-grade existence. If she became a devil here, all of them would die. They wouldn’t even have a chance to escape.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, the bhikkhuni’s actions left everyone dumbfounded. Wei Ge froze.</p>
<p>The bhikkhuni looked at Wei Ge and calmly sat down. She slowly closed her eyes as her body emitted a Buddhistic glow. Her body gradually changed into the appearance of Buddha.</p>
<p>The Buddhistic glow illuminated everything. Everything that encountered the Buddhistic glow returned to its original natural state.</p>
<p>The flames extinguished as the trees bloomed and the river flowed. Greenery spread over the mountains as flowers bloomed everywhere.</p>
<p>“She… is about to become a Buddha…” Hermit was indescribably shocked.</p>
<p>He really couldn’t believe such a ridiculous thing. A person like Wei Ge who had his hands stained with blood had actually made her become a Buddha instead of a devil when facing him.</p>
<p>“No… Impossible…” Wei Ge was dumbfounded as well. How could a person like him be someone who could make the bhikkhuni Buddha? Even he didn’t believe that he was a good person.</p>
<p>More importantly, once the bhikkhuni became a Buddha, she would be harmless and wouldn’t harm anyone. It was very likely that she would tear through the air and leave Earth immediately.</p>
<p>Without the help of the bhikkhuni, Wei Ge was no match for Cave Era and Hermit. All his plans were in vain.</p>
<p>Wei Ge gritted his teeth and rushed forward to use his flames to burn the bhikkhuni, hoping to use violence to degenerate her into a devil.</p>
<p>However, when his flames burned on the bhikkhuni, her Buddhistic glow intensified as her body rapidly transformed into a Buddha.</p>
<p>“F*cking become a devil!” Wei Ge angrily threw a punch at the bhikkhuni’s face, but his fist was blocked by the Buddhistic glow over the bhikkhuni’s body.</p>
<p>The bhikkhuni had already transformed into Buddha. She nodded at Wei Ge with a smile before slowly rising into the void under the Buddhistic glow. She tore out of Earth and vanished. The scene of calamity that accompanied her vanished.</p>
<p>F*ck… The feeling in Wei Ge’s heart was indescribable. He mechanically turned to look at Cave Era and Hermit, only to see them looking at him with killing intent written all over their faces. Furthermore, they had already surrounded him.</p>
<p>“Will you believe me if I say that this is all a misunderstanding?” Wei Ge said wryly.</p>
<p>“Guess?” Hermit stared coldly at Wei Ge and blocked his escape.</p>
<p>Cave Era stood in front of Wei Ge with a nasty expression. If not for the accident, their lives would have been ended by Wei Ge.</p>
<p>“Director-General Wei, I’ve really underestimated you. However, don’t worry. This time, I’ll definitely do my best to send you to the place you wish to go.” Hermit’s expression was sinister as a strange light swirled around his body. The power of his Terror transformation had already been pushed to its limits.</p>
<p>Wei Ge cursed inwardly. The heavens really want me dead. To think that I wanted a close victory, but I lost before I could even start.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to trouble the two of you about sending him where he wants to go.” A figure appeared beside Wei Ge.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen!” Hermit and Cave Era’s expressions changed.</p>
<p>“What a coincidence. I thought you wouldn’t make it.” Wei Ge finally heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>As Wei Ge had received the news too late and couldn’t contact Zhou Wen, he had no choice but to think of a way to take the risk to send the news to An Sheng. It was unknown if An Sheng believed him, the Monarch Bee. It was also a question if he could contact Zhou Wen and get him to return. He originally didn’t have much hope, but he never expected Zhou Wen to really rush back.</p>
<p>“I’ve been back for quite some time. I couldn’t bear to disturb you when I saw how engrossed you were in your performance, so I watched for a while,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>Wei Ge looked at Zhou Wen in a daze. Now, he had the urge to get the female Buddha to take Zhou Wen away.</p>
<p>“One each. You get first dibs.” Zhou Wen gripped his Bamboo Blade tightly and looked at Cave Era and Hermit.</p>
<p>“I’m not a particular person, nor am I a gentleman. Leave hitting women to me,” Wei Ge said as he looked at Cave Era.</p>
<p>“Alright, this is mine.” Zhou Wen walked towards Cave Era.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1368'>Chapter 1368: Battling Hermit</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“Let’s go,” Hermit said before turning into a beam of light to escape.</p>
<p>“Did I say that you can leave?” Zhou Wen didn’t chase after him as he said coldly.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could finish his sentence, Hermit stopped.</p>
<p>Hermit floated in midair with a look of horror. His left arm was severed at the shoulder as blood spewed out from his stump.</p>
<p>When the severed arm fell from the sky, it was like tofu that had landed on invisible blades. When it landed on the ground, it had already turned into a pile of fragments.</p>
<p>The reason Zhou Wen didn’t appear immediately wasn’t that he wanted to watch Wei Ge’s performance. During that period of time, he had already used the invisible sword aura to set up the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array and seal off the area.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Hermit was lucky. His arm was the first thing that slammed into it; if his head had hit it, he would have been split into two. He wouldn’t even have the chance to react.</p>
<p>Hermit didn’t dare move because he didn’t know where the motionless invisible sword beams were. Rashly charging over was no different from courting death.</p>
<p>Cave Era’s figure flashed as she attempted to approach Hermit. She wanted to take him back to the headquarters of the League of Guardians with her temporal powers.</p>
<p>“I’m your opponent.” Purple flames danced like butterflies that filled the sky, sealing Cave Era’s path. Wei Ge’s flaming figure appeared behind her.</p>
<p>Previously, because he knew that he wasn’t a match for Cave Era and Hermit’s combined forces, Wei Ge had only dodged and had never taken the initiative to attack.</p>
<p>Cave Era counterattacked. Under the effects of Time Acceleration, the palm was unbelievably fast. When it struck Wei Ge, it immediately penetrated a hole in his body.</p>
<p>However, Wei Ge only smiled. Instead of retreating, he advanced as though he didn’t feel any pain. He came in front of Cave Era and reached out to grab her face. As for Cave Era’s entire arm, it penetrated Wei Ge’s body.</p>
<p>Alarmed, Cave Era quickly retreated, causing Wei Ge’s extended palm to miss. Wei Ge’s body was like flames. After Cave Era’s arm retreated, his body was automatically restored as one.</p>
<p>The flames flickered as Wei Ge seemed to really transform into flames. Wherever the fire butterfly appeared, he could instantly reach it like a ghost.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Cave Era’s temporal powers couldn’t be underestimated. Although Wei Ge’s attacks were strange, he failed to touch Cave Era.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you have to think it through carefully. Do you really want to become enemies with the League of Guardians? Do you know how many Guardians there are in the entire Federation? Do you know how many people want to have Guardians? As long as you are willing, you can become one of us and have the best Guardian,” Hermit said to Zhou Wen with a changing expression.</p>
<p>“Guardian? What kind of Guardian can you provide me? Mythical? Terror? Or Calamity?” Zhou Wen didn’t move, but the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Sword Array formed by invisible sword beams had already begun circulating as it tore through the air and attacked Hermit.</p>
<p>The airflow and sonic booms caused by the moving invisible sword beams gave Hermit a way to determine the attacks. As he dodged and blocked the invisible sword beams, he said, “A powerhouse like you naturally has to contract with the top Terror-grade Guardian. It also won’t be difficult for you to advance to the Calamity grade in the future.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen said indifferently, “I didn’t even agree to contract a Calamity-grade Guardian. Do you think I’ll want your Terror-grade Guardian?”</p>
<p>Hermit suddenly transformed into a stream of light and flew away. Instantly, he passed through the layers of invisible blades and arrived hundreds of meters away.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you are still too young. It’s the unknown that people fear. You shouldn’t have let those invisible sword beams circulate and let me figure out their location. The next time we meet will be your death,” Hermit said as he accelerated.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Just as Hermit finished speaking, he let out a tragic cry. His face seemed to slam into an invisible blade as half his facial skin was sliced off.</p>
<p>As he couldn’t dodge in time, a piece of his shoulder was sliced off. Blood gushed out like a fountain.</p>
<p>“Keep talking,” Zhou Wen said to Hermit.</p>
<p>Hermit’s face was livid. He was already severely injured before Zhou Wen had really struck. His combat strength had been halved.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, don’t force me.” Hermit knew that he was in a hopeless situation when he saw that Cave Era was held back by Wei Ge and was unable to help him.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen others fight to the death. I just want to see it for myself,” Zhou Wen said unhurriedly.</p>
<p>With the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Sword Array trapping Hermit, it was impossible for Hermit to escape. Zhou Wen wanted to know how strong the four Heavenly Kings of the League of Guardians were.</p>
<p>“Fine!” Hermit’s eyes turned ferocious as the Guardian armor on his body emitted a demonic glow.</p>
<p>Behind the armor, arm after arm formed. In the blink of an eye, a wheel made of more than a thousand arms appeared behind Hermit.</p>
<p>The palm on the arm was clenched. When the palm opened, one could see eyes growing in the palm. They looked extremely demonic and terrifying.</p>
<p>Why does this fellow’s Guardian armor look a little like the one in myths and legends… Zhou Wen looked at the thousand-handed, thousand-eyed Guardian armor and revealed a thoughtful expression.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>As for Cave Era, who was fighting elsewhere, she was pleasantly surprised when she saw the changes in Hermit’s armor. Hermit has already reached such a stage without anyone noticing. The Guardian has already completely undergone Terror transformation. He’s just one step away from advancing to the Calamity grade!</p>
<p>Such a Hermit gave Cave Era a sliver of hope. If Hermit could defeat Zhou Wen, their plan today wouldn’t be considered a complete failure.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was in thought, Hermit’s body emitted a strange glow that condensed into a thousand-handed, thousand-eyed Bodhisattva projection.</p>
<p>The figure was hundreds of meters tall and its glow illuminated a hundred kilometers. Even Luoyang City in the distance could clearly see the terrifying figure.</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“The legendary thousand-handed, thousand-eyed Bodhisattva… Doesn’t that mean…”</p>
<p>“Then who’s fighting?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Everyone discussed spiritedly. The terrifying might emitted by the thousand-handed, Thousand-Eyed Bodhisattva made one’s heart tremble.</p>
<p>“Should we reinforce Young Master Wen?” An Sheng couldn’t help but worry when he saw that Hermit could produce such terrifying strength.</p>
<p>“There’s no need,” Leng Zongzheng said indifferently as he continued sitting in the city.</p>
<p>Hermit muttered something as the thousand-handed, thousand-eyed Bodhisattva spoke like it was reading scriptures. It held the sky with its palms as its eyes emitted divine light.</p>
<p>Destruction was left in the wake of the terrifying divine light as though it wanted to destroy the world.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, go to hell!” With Hermit’s roar, the thousand hands and thousand eyes aimed at Zhou Wen. Instantly, divine light condensed as a beam that resembled a blazing sun instantly arrived in front of Zhou Wen. The dazzling light seemed to devour everything.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>While everyone was reeling in shock, they saw sword beams cascade down like a galaxy.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1369'>Chapter 1369: The Sunlight Here Is Too Glaring</h3>
<p>Countless sword beams condensed into something corporeal as if a galaxy was pouring out and colliding with the terrifying beam of light.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>The sound of steel nails piercing wooden planks sounded. Countless sword beams tore through the beam of light and surged upward, shattering the beam of light.</p>
<p>The noble and terrifying figure—which resembled a thousand-armed and thousand-eyed Bodhisattva—instantly shattered like glass under the countless sword beams’ impact.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Under the assault of countless sword beams, Hermit’s body was drowned by the sword stream. His tragic scream stopped just as his body and his Guardian armor shattered and dissipated in the torrent.</p>
<p>The terrifying Bodhisattva’s figure vanished. Only the galaxy-like sword stream revolved around Zhou Wen like a dazzling star.</p>
<p>Cave Era was horrified. She had never seen such a terrifying attack at the Terror level in her life. Even Immortal probably didn’t have such terrifying destructive power.</p>
<p>Hermit’s thousand-handed, thousand-eyed power was considered top-notch destructive power at the Terror grade, but it was as weak as tofu around Zhou Wen’s sword stream. What terrifying power was this?</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Cave Era used her temporal powers and instantly vanished. She didn’t dare stay another second.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array had already scared her guts out.</p>
<p>“Hermit, one of the four Heavenly Kings, is nothing much. Can’t he last a little longer?” Zhou Wen said in disappointment.</p>
<p>He said such a thing because he hadn’t considered that using the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array was no longer a one-on-one battle. It was equivalent to countless Terror-grade creatures ganking Hermit. It would be strange if Hermit could withstand them.</p>
<p>Wei Ge looked at Zhou Wen and couldn’t help but shake his head and smile bitterly. He thought to himself, I originally thought that I had done extremely well over the years and might have a chance to compete with this fellow. I never expected this fellow to have already reached this stage…</p>
<p>“President, I really have to thank you for this. If you hadn’t sent the news in time, I probably wouldn’t have been able to rush back in time. Without you attracting the bhikkhuni to finish off the undead in the city, Luoyang would have suffered heavy losses. I wonder how many people would have died.” Zhou Wen still used the title he used to address Wei Ge in school instead of using his present official title.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to thank me. I’m just doing what I want to do to satisfy my selfish desires. Saving them was only in passing.” Wei Ge looked at Zhou Wen and asked, “You should be advancing to the Calamity grade soon, right?”</p>
<p>Calamity? Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback before he shook his head and said with a bitter smile, “Let’s not even talk about the Calamity grade, I don’t even know how to advance to the Terror grade.”</p>
<p>“You… are still at the Mythical stage?” Wei Ge was stunned as he looked at Zhou Wen in disbelief.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded. “I also want to advance to the Terror grade, but I haven’t been able to do so.”</p>
<p>Wei Ge looked at Zhou Wen with an odd expression. After a while, he sighed and said, “You advanced to the Mythical stage as a human?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded again. “Yes, this path is too difficult. I’m still figuring it out.”</p>
<p>“Continue on. I’m beginning to look forward to the day you advance to the Terror grade.” With that said, Wei Ge turned around and left.</p>
<p>“Where are you going? Why don’t you stay in Luoyang?” Zhou Wen extended an invitation.</p>
<p>Wei Ge had helped Luoyang through the calamity and completely severed ties with the League of Guardians. It was too dangerous for him to return now. The League of Guardians probably wouldn’t let him off.</p>
<p>Wei Ge looked at the sky and said indifferently, “Devils can survive anywhere, even in hell. Besides, I don’t like sunlight. The sunlight here is too blinding.”</p>
<p>Sunlight… Blinding… Zhou Wen looked up at the sky. It seemed to be nighttime, and it was cloudy. There wasn’t even a moon.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, Wei Ge vanished into the distance. Only the specks of smoke from his flaming robe hadn’t completely dissipated, like fireflies.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head. He had discovered a very serious problem.</p>
<p>None of the students from their generation who had graduated from Sunset College seemed to be a sociable bunch. Apart from Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan who were considered to be close, most of them were from different factions. There was no talk of cooperation.</p>
<p>After Luoyang’s calamity was over, Zhou Wen returned to Overseer Manor.</p>
<p>Sweetie had followed Zhou Wen to Overseer Manor. Zhou Wen had no choice but to get An Sheng to take good care of her, but he definitely couldn’t let anyone touch her.</p>
<p>However, An Sheng didn’t give Sweetie special attention. He treated her like any ordinary guest. He didn’t even prepare the desserts that Zhou Wen wanted him to prepare for her.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled, and when he asked An Sheng why he was doing this, An Sheng only told him, “You won’t find it sweet if you add too much sugar.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a while before finding An Sheng’s words interesting.</p>
<p>“Why don’t I see Ice Maiden and Nether Lotus?” Zhou Wen had been somewhat puzzled as to why he hadn’t seen them. However, there had been too many things on his plate that he hadn’t had the time to ask.</p>
<p>“They previously helped suppress Chess Mountain, but they recently disappeared. They must have entered Chess Mountain,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“They entered after all?” Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised.</p>
<p>Ice Maiden wanted the Demon God Bloodline Catalog, while Nether Lotus wanted to enter to take the strongest Companion Beast on Earth. It would be strange if they could remain well-behaved.</p>
<p>However, with their strength, they couldn’t cause much of a stir in Chess Mountain. Now, Zhou Wen was afraid that the two of them would end up in The Thearch’s hands.</p>
<p>“Forget it. Let them be.” Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered anymore.</p>
<p>Now, the most pressing matter for him was the advancement to the Terror grade. He still needed to master the infinite spatial circulation skill. Otherwise, it would be impossible to kill the Calamity-grade in the Venusian instance dungeon.</p>
<p>Slaughterer, Slaughterer, how do you advance? Zhou Wen had killed quite a number of high-level creatures, but he had been unable to trigger Slaughterer’s growth. This made Zhou Wen suspect that it wasn’t as simple as killing to advance Slaughterer to the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Since killing doesn’t work, I might as well change my train of thought. Zhou Wen felt that he had to find another way out.</p>
<p>Sweetie’s question gave Zhou Wen a headache. With such a time bomb by his side, no one knew when it would explode. It would be very troublesome when that happened.</p>
<p>Should I give it a try and eat that lemon candy? Zhou Wen was already tempted.</p>
<p>It was just too difficult for him to advance. If the lemon candy could really advance him, all the difficulties would be resolved.</p>
<p>However, after some thought, Zhou Wen gave up on the idea.</p>
<p>Firstly, Sweetie had been following him the entire time. If he took out the lemon candy, it was hard to guarantee that Sweetie wouldn’t discover it immediately and give him no chance to eat it.</p>
<p>Secondly, Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that if he couldn’t truly understand Slaughterer, it would be a hidden danger even if he advanced to the Terror grade.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, Chancellor Leng has invited you over,” An Sheng knocked on the door and said.</p>
<p>“Why is Chancellor Leng looking for me?” Zhou Wen opened the door and asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. However, Chancellor Leng doesn’t like to be disturbed. Even a proud student like Overseer won’t have an easy time meeting him. There’s no harm in meeting him,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that An Sheng was right, so he followed the address An Sheng had given him to Leng Zongzheng’s residence.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1370'>Chapter 1370: Heart Slaying</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Although Leng Zongzheng had a residence on campus, the place Zhou Wen was heading to wasn’t on campus, but in an inconspicuous yard in the old district of Luoyang City.</p>
<p>The yard was very ordinary. As it was very humid nearby, moss grew at the base of the walls. There were also many plants that looked like creepers on the walls.</p>
<p>Underneath all this, a building was constructed of red bricks that were often seen in the past. Although it was very clean, it couldn’t hide the ravages left by time. Some of the bricks on the walls were already showing signs of erosion.</p>
<p>“Chancellor Leng, it’s Zhou Wen. Are you home?” Zhou Wen knocked on the door.</p>
<p>“Come in.” Leng Zongzheng’s voice sounded from the building. When Zhou Wen pushed the door open and entered, Leng Zongzheng had brought out a pot of cactus.</p>
<p>“Chancellor Leng, is this your home?” Zhou Wen sized up the room and saw that the various decorations were very outdated, but they weren’t considered ancient. They gave off a mediocre and dilapidated feeling.</p>
<p>This was very different from the feeling Leng Zongzheng gave Zhou Wen. Be it his looks or actions, Leng Zongzheng had the demeanor of a nobleman. Furthermore, his Life Soul was something that looked very grand like the Demonic Organ Throne, so it made one feel that Leng Zongzheng was a person who placed great importance on the quality of life and details. He shouldn’t be living in such a mediocre home.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t see anything special in the yard. No matter how he searched, they were just daily necessities. There were even many items easily obtainable from street stalls.</p>
<p>“I lived here when I was young. This is my grandfather’s old residence.” Leng Zongzheng placed the cactus by the side and patted the dust off his hands. He continued, “In the past, I hated this place. I always felt that I had to stand out and live in a beautiful big house. I had to live like a decent human. However, I didn’t know when it started, but I suddenly felt that living here was more comfortable, so I moved back.”</p>
<p>“This is about returning to the basics, right?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng glanced at Zhou Wen and curled his lips. “What do you mean by returning to the basics? To put it bluntly, I’ve had too much braised meat and want to eat some vegetables to get rid of the cloying taste. I haven’t reached that stage yet. I haven’t tried many good things and I’m not sick of them.”</p>
<p>With that said, Leng Zongzheng sat down on a wooden stool in the yard. As he basked in the sun, he continued, “I’ve also considered why I wanted to move back. In terms of comfort, this place definitely can’t compare to any place I’ve lived in. In terms of convenience, it’s not convenient here either. If you want to say that it has a nice environment and that it’s quiet enough, this place is far inferior to the villa I bought in the past. To say that I have good neighbors and how conducive it is to stay here, it’s not the case either. No one stays here anymore. The old neighbors have long vanished. Even if they are still here, I don’t have a good impression of them. I never really liked them.”</p>
<p>“Then why do you like living here?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>“I’ve thought about this question for a long time. Later, I confirmed that the reason I like living here is that I’m afraid,” Leng Zongzheng said.</p>
<p>“Afraid?” Zhou Wen was even more puzzled.</p>
<p>In terms of safety, this place was far inferior to the college. There were no defensive measures. It was just a dilapidated old city district. Any Terror-grade could reduce this place to ruins with one swoop.</p>
<p>“Yes, afraid,” Leng Zongzheng said. “People are afraid of death to varying degrees. Some people put the fear of death first, while others put the fear of death behind some other things. Therefore, when they encounter certain things, they appear to be unafraid of death. However, no one is unafraid of death. It’s just that he has encountered something that terrifies him more than death, making death pale in comparison.”</p>
<p>As Leng Zongzheng spoke, he took out a lighter and cigarette box and flicked out a cigarette with great familiarity. He held it in his mouth and lit it up. Then, he took a drag and closed his eyes as though he was enjoying it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Leng Zongzheng in a daze. This was very different from the impression Leng Zongzheng usually gave him. If he didn’t know that this was Leng Zongzheng, he would have imagined him to be a decadent middle-aged man who liked to gamble and drink.</p>
<p>After a while, Leng Zongzheng closed his eyes. Basking in the sun, he continued, “Later on, I thought carefully. My fear of death should be ranked third. There are two things that rank before death. If I were to encounter those two things, I would rather choose death.”</p>
<p>“Are you here because you are afraid of those two things happening?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Leng Zongzheng shook his head and said, “No, those two things have already happened.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Leng Zongzheng in a daze, unsure what he was getting at.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng continued, “In the past, I was very afraid that I would become someone like my parents, but now, I’m fundamentally no different from them. In the past, I was very afraid that Grandpa would leave me. That way, I would be alone in this world, but that day still came. I live here because I’m afraid of loneliness, but in fact, I’ve always been alone.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what to say. He had occasionally had some thoughts about what Leng Zongzheng had said, but he didn’t think them through as clearly as Leng Zongzheng.</p>
<p>However, looking at Leng Zongzheng, Zhou Wen felt that Chancellor Leng wasn’t as difficult to get along with as he had imagined.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng took another drag of his cigarette and pressed the remaining half of it on the cement flower bed beside him. He extinguished the cigarette butt and reached out to flick it into the trash can.</p>
<p>“Living here gives me an inexplicable sense of security. I feel that this is my tiny world. As long as I hide here, I don’t have to worry about anything, nor do I have to worry about anything. As long as I sleep, it’s as though anything bad will disappear.”</p>
<p>With that said, Leng Zongzheng laughed self-deprecatingly. “But in fact, nothing is resolved. I’m just fooling myself.”</p>
<p>“You can’t say that. Humans need a place for their hearts to seek refuge. A place that allows their minds to recover and be nurtured. Perhaps this place doesn’t provide you with any substantial help in resolving problems, but it can calm your mind and allow you to face those problems with a calm mind. That is very important,” Zhou Wen said solemnly.</p>
<p>“You’re right,” Leng Zongzheng said as he suddenly extended his palm and pressed it on the wall beside him. The entire yard and house instantly shattered, turning into fragments that rose up.</p>
<p>“W-what are you doing…” Standing in the ruins, the rubble around him kept rising. Zhou Wen looked at Leng Zongzheng in a daze, unsure why he was doing this.</p>
<p>Amidst the shattered and rising fragments, Leng Zongzheng turned around and left. As he walked, he said, “Just as you said, everyone has a place they seek refuge with. It’s a place of terror that’s closer to the heart than death. If you encounter an enemy that doesn’t rank the terror of Death first one day, you should think about how to find that place that belongs to him. Killing someone is about slaying the heart. Sometimes, the slaying of the heart is even more terrifying than death. You are overall good, but you are too kind. Sometimes, kindness is a sin.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Killing someone… is the slaying of the heart… Zhou Wen stood in the ruins and looked at Leng Zongzheng’s departing figure as emotions stirred in his heart.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1371'>Chapter 1371: There’s No What Ifs</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen’s talent was having focus; it gave him extraordinary focus.</p>
<p>However, there were pros and cons to everything. Zhou Wen could quickly devote himself to everything he did. This made him learn everything faster than the average person. It wasn’t easy for him to be distracted, so he was very difficult to obstruct.</p>
<p>On the contrary, due to his focus, Zhou Wen wasn’t a person with a repertoire of feelings like the average person. He wasn’t that sensitive, so it was very difficult for him to notice things regarding emotion.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s knowledge, defeating an enemy was similar to adding and subtracting. He would only consider the losses between him and his opponent.</p>
<p>In his calculations, killing his opponent was already the enemy’s greatest loss.</p>
<p>However, Leng Zongzheng’s words opened up a new world to Zhou Wen. Killing an opponent wasn’t the greatest loss to the opponent.</p>
<p>Of course, this theory was only effective on some people. Or rather, it was effective at a particular point in time, not an eternal, immutable condition.</p>
<p>Heart Slaying? Many thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind. He actually felt the Slaughterer in his body vaguely respond as though it was telling him that he had found the right path.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked in the direction Leng Zongzheng had left with a complicated expression. Leng Zongzheng had clearly noticed his problem in his battle with Hermit. He had called him over to make him understand this reason.</p>
<p>Although it was enlightening, Leng Zongzheng’s words came from the bottom of his heart. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have stirred Zhou Wen so much.</p>
<p>When he destroyed the yard before he left, it was obvious that Leng Zongzheng wasn’t telling a story, but something that had really happened to him.</p>
<p>It was because of this that he wanted to destroy the yard. Since he had said it, this weakness would be known sooner or later. Therefore, he definitely couldn’t leave it behind.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but bow in the direction Leng Zongzheng had left. The yard was Leng Zongzheng’s last hope of kinship. It had been destroyed because of Zhou Wen. It left him at a loss on how to return the favor.</p>
<p>All Zhou Wen could do now was advance to the Terror grade as soon as possible.</p>
<p>How can I achieve Heart Slaying? How can I know what’s more important to the enemy than life? As Zhou Wen walked back, he thought about this problem.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Hermit is dead?” In the League of Guardians, Immortal looked down at Cave Era and asked.</p>
<p>“I was incompetent. Please mete out your punishment.” Cave Era lowered her head.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, this matter can’t be blamed on Cave Era and Hermit. Who would have expected that the Monarch Bee Wei Ge, whose hands are covered in blood and almost despised by the entire Federation, is actually a man who can make bhikkhuni a Buddha,” said Blood Shaman.</p>
<p>“Hermit has only himself to blame for not utilizing people properly,” Uesugi Nao said.</p>
<p>Blood Shaman frowned slightly and was about to say something when Cave Era beat him to it. “This battle was indeed my oversight. A loss is a loss. There’s no excuse. I’ll take responsibility.”</p>
<p>Immortal just sat there without moving from beginning to end, like a lifeless statue.</p>
<p>After everyone quietened down, Immortal slowly said, “How’s the reconstruction of Skysplit Tower going?”</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao answered, “As too many resources are needed, and there aren’t any excess reserves due to previous expenditure, the progress is very slow now. We can only wait for most of the materials. It’s estimated to take another four months or so to recover to its previous progress.”</p>
<p>“How long would it take to only build the Heavenly Ascension Platform?” Immortal asked again.</p>
<p>“As we were preparing to build the Heavenly Ascension Platform last previously, the materials are still in the warehouse. They aren’t damaged. If we start building it now, we can build the Heavenly Ascension Platform in about two years. However, without the main body of the Skysplit Tower and only the Heavenly Ascension Platform, we won’t be able to connect to the dimension. It’s useless even if we have the Heavenly Ascension Platform, right?” Uesugi Nao said after some thought.</p>
<p>“I want to see a complete Heavenly Ascension Platform in a month,” Immortal said.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao immediately felt stumped, but Immortal’s words probably didn’t allow her to refute. Therefore, she said, “If that’s the case, I need the full support of the Federation.”</p>
<p>“Cave Era, Blood Shaman, from now on, all of you will help Nao build the Heavenly Ascension Platform. Nao has priority with all the resources in the alliance,” Immortal said.</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Excellency.” Cave Era and Blood Shaman answered at the same time.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, do you want to use the Heavenly Ascension Platform to connect to the dimension to think of a way to deal with Zhou Wen and the An family?” Blood Shaman asked.</p>
<p>Immortal said indifferently, “In this era, all kinds of heroes have risen. The six families are definitely not weak. There’s the Hui family in the Federation, and the Holy Spirit Association beyond. Human Sovereign, Deceit King, and Luoyang’s An family are all our greatest problems. However, these aren’t important. What’s really important is the Venusian dimensional zone. As long as we get first place on the rankings and obtain the Venusian Companion Beast, these threats won’t be considered much.”</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, do you mean that you want to borrow the dimensional forces to enter the Venusian dimensional zone again?” Blood Shaman immediately understood that Immortal’s attention was never focused on Zhou Wen or Luoyang’s An family. He thought further.</p>
<p>“Since you want to succeed, you have to pay a price. Be it on Earth or in the dimension, it’s the same principle,” Immortal said indifferently. “In a month, you have to build the Heavenly Ascension Platform.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Excellency,” Uesugi Nao and company answered.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, what are you doing sitting there?” Sweetie was feeling uncomfortable. She hadn’t had desserts for days.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen often got people to buy desserts in the past, so she could enjoy the remaining desserts.</p>
<p>However, over the past few days, Zhou Wen had been sitting there in a daze. He didn’t even eat, much less get someone to buy desserts for him.</p>
<p>“I’m thinking about something,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“What’s on your mind?” Sweetie pressed.</p>
<p>“You ghosts don’t understand these things,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“How do you know that I don’t understand? Let me tell you, there’s nothing I don’t understand,” Sweetie said angrily.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored her. He couldn’t tell Sweetie that he was thinking about how to kill someone, right?</p>
<p>Sweetie was God. To tell God to her face that he wanted to kill someone and wanted to make the other party suffer a fate worse than death would mean that Zhou Wen was crazy.</p>
<p>“I don’t care. I want to eat cake, I want pudding, I want milk tea…” It wasn’t the first time Sweetie had been exposed. She had already given up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the exasperated Sweetie and seemed to think of something. His eyes gradually lit up as he sized her up.</p>
<p>“What are you trying to do?” Sweetie was a little frightened by Zhou Wen’s gaze. She took two steps back and asked Zhou Wen warily.</p>
<p>“If you have an illness that kills you as long as you take one mouthful of something sweet, would you still want something like a cake?” Zhou Wen asked Sweetie.</p>
<p>“I won’t get sick,” Sweetie said.</p>
<p>“I’m saying if.”</p>
<p>“Even so, I still wouldn’t get sick.”</p>
<p>“That’s just an analogy. If you get this illness…”</p>
<p>“There’s no what ifs. It’s impossible for me to get sick.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a little uncomfortable being rendered speechless by Sweetie. He couldn’t say his original thoughts. It was like a fishbone stuck in his throat, something he couldn’t swallow or spit out.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1372'>Chapter 1372: Yang City</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>This discomfort gave Zhou Wen new ideas.</p>
<p>That’s right. The so-called Heart Slaying doesn’t necessarily have to make the other party wish they were dead. From a broader picture, it’s to make one wish they were dead. But drilling down, as long as it can make the enemy feel uncomfortable, it can also be said to be a destruction of heart. The so-called Heart Slaying is actually pointing at the weakness of the other party’s humanity. In other words, what I need to do is to see through the other party’s weaknesses in human nature.</p>
<p>It’s easy to find flaws in a move because the move is right there. I can study ways to crack it at any time, but how can I figure out the weakness in human nature of an enemy I’m not familiar with? Zhou Wen fell into deep thought again.</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhou Wen was in a daze again, Sweetie lowered her head in a daze. Her eyes were focused elsewhere as she gloomily turned around and left the yard. She had the urge to head out to have some desserts.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen specially told me to buy this for you. Eat it while it’s hot.” Just as Sweetie stepped out, she saw An Sheng walk over with a box in his hand.</p>
<p>“This is… the plum blossom cake from Yun’s…” Sweetie’s eyes lit up when she saw the box. She nearly drooled.</p>
<p>The last time she ate with Zhou Wen and Madam Lan, she had seen Zhou Wen eat such a plum blossom cake. Back then, her appetite had been whet, but Zhou Wen hadn’t left any for her. It left Sweetie depressed the entire day.</p>
<p>“Why would I want his things?” Sweetie turned her head to the side as though it was beneath her, but she couldn’t help but glance at the box of plum blossom cake.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen said that you like it, so he got me to specially buy it for you. Since you don’t like it, I’ll throw it away.” An Sheng turned around and left.</p>
<p>“Don’t… It’s a waste to throw it away… Although I really don’t like plum blossom cake… I can’t waste food… I’ll just… accept it…” Sweetie said with a red face.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll leave it to you.” An Sheng handed the box to Sweetie before turning to leave.</p>
<p>After An Sheng left, Sweetie found an empty garden. She opened the box and leaned in to take a sniff. The sweet smell immediately made her face beam with happiness.</p>
<p>Soon, Sweetie’s mouth was filled with plum blossom cake. Her cheeks were full, and the corners of her mouth were stained with red bean stuffing. As she ate, she muttered to herself, “That baddie, Zhou Wen, isn’t too bad at times. He’s not hopeless… Uh… Nice…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still pondering over his problems. He wasn’t in the mood to instruct An Sheng to prepare those. However, An Sheng had found an opportunity to prepare the plum blossom cake for her when he saw that Sweetie liked it a lot.</p>
<p>If it’s someone I’m familiar with, I know their temperament and might discover their weakness in human nature… That’s not right either… No matter how close a person is to me, they will bury secrets in their hearts. Ordinary people wouldn’t show their weakest side to others, much less strangers…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought hard. Since it’s impossible to know the weakness of the other party’s human nature from their words, I can only rely on observation. But what kind of observation can point straight at the human heart?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that he definitely couldn’t figure it out by just thinking about it. He had to personally observe it to discover it.</p>
<p>Who should I observe? Zhou Wen thought for a moment. Although Sweetie was with him all day and he could observe her at any time, she was like a blank piece of paper. Everything was written on her face. He didn’t need to observe to know what she was thinking.</p>
<p>As for people close to them, it didn’t seem appropriate to observe the weaknesses in their nature.</p>
<p>I have to find an enemy, Zhou Wen muttered to himself before creating a list in his heart.</p>
<p>The first to bear the brunt was naturally the League of Guardians. Zhou Wen felt that it was time for him to make a trip to the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>Others were afraid of the Terror-grade Guardians of the League of Guardians, but Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid at all. With the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of a siege.</p>
<p>As long as he was given enough time in advance to set up the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, it was useless no matter how many Terror-grade Guardians there were unless someone could crack it.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be different if a Calamity-grade creature came. Thankfully, the League of Guardians still didn’t have any Calamity-grade creatures.</p>
<p>It was as though the dimension couldn’t create a Calamity-grade Guardian. The Guardians that were teleported to Earth were at most at the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Since they can come to Luoyang, why can’t I go to the League of Guardians? Even if I can’t defeat them, it’s good to see how strong they are. Zhou Wen had no intention of killing anyone on his trip.</p>
<p>Firstly, killing people didn’t benefit him. It didn’t allow Slaughterer to advance. What was key was to figure out a method to discover the weakness of one’s human nature. Secondly, with Sweetie by his side, if he really started a massacre, Sweetie wouldn’t be able to watch on and would represent the kind and righteous Heaven to destroy him. Zhou Wen wouldn’t even have the time to cry.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen told An Sheng about his intention to go to the League of Guardians. He originally imagined that An Sheng would persuade him not to take the risk.</p>
<p>To his surprise, An Sheng’s eyes lit up as he said, “You should have done this a long time ago. Young Master Wen, I’ve long wanted to say that you’re good at everything, but you’re too kind-hearted. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Blood for blood. If others slap you, you have to slap them back. That’s what makes it awesome.”</p>
<p>“You have to continue with the matter of the Heavenly Robe.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said, “I want to sell the Heavenly Robe to the League of Guardians.”</p>
<p>“At this stage, is it still possible?” An Sheng felt that it wouldn’t be easy to sell the Heavenly Robe to the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>“Where there’s a will there is a way. Just continue making preparations. There’s no need to deliberately interact with the League of Guardians. Let’s first interact with other people who are interested in the Heavenly Robe. Have the necessary discussions.” Zhou Wen already had plans.</p>
<p>“Alright, I know what to do.” An Sheng understood what Zhou Wen meant.</p>
<p>After making arrangements for Luoyang, Zhou Wen set off for the headquarters of the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>Sweetie naturally wouldn’t let Zhou Wen off. She continued following him as though she wouldn’t stop until she found a reason to kill him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sat on the Earth Elemental Beast’s back and took out his phone. He switched on the downloaded Yang City to see what was inside Yang City that even Sweetie—God—wasn’t willing to enter.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Yang City was a mud city. The blood-colored avatar pushed open the door and entered. With a turn of the camera, many buildings made of clay bricks and wood appeared on the screen. They looked ancient and backward.</p>
<p>The city wasn’t small. Strangely, Zhou Wen didn’t see any living dimensional creature. The whole of Yang City was dead silent, like a ghost city.</p>
<p>What’s that? Zhou Wen sized up the buildings in Yang City and quickly discovered something strange.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1373'>Chapter 1373: Blood Bone Temples</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that something was amiss with the buildings here, even though they had mud bricks and wooden roofs from the outside.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen saw a gigantic pillar that resembled a femur in the nearest building. It was definitely not made of wood or mud.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully observed the room again and realized that not only were the pillars in the room made of bone, but even the ceiling beam and spine were bones.</p>
<p>Or it should be said that the entire roof was a gigantic spine and rib cage? The columns were leg bones. The interior of the room was propped up by the bones of an unknown beast.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated as he quickly looked at the nearby buildings and realized that it was as he had imagined.</p>
<p>He saw the bones of various beasts in buildings of various sizes. Or rather, these buildings were built according to the bones of the beasts.</p>
<p>Those with relatively smaller bones had smaller buildings. Some of the small houses were only half the height of a person, looking like models. However, the bones inside were real.</p>
<p>The large buildings were like a palace, and the bones inside were astonishingly large. It was difficult to imagine how terrifying a ferocious beast the bones were from when it was still alive.</p>
<p>According to the different skeletal structures, each building had a different appearance. Some were long, some were short, and some were tall. They looked very strange.</p>
<p>The more Zhou Wen looked at it, the more he felt that something was amiss. This place shouldn’t be called a city, but a temple complex.</p>
<p>Of course, the temples here didn’t worship deities but the strange beast bones.</p>
<p>The inside of the temple is the bones of mutated beasts… Then, these mud walls and wooden roofs… Zhou Wen looked at the yellowish-red mud bricks and couldn’t help but associate them with something.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me those mud bricks are formed from mixing mutated beast blood? The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more fearful he became.</p>
<p>If this Yang City was really built using mutated beast blood mixed with soil, how much blood was needed?</p>
<p>There was also something that puzzled Zhou Wen. It was said that no one left Yang City alive. However, he had yet to encounter any danger.</p>
<p>Since he was already here, he naturally couldn’t return empty-handed. Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth and made it head for a blood bone temple. He wanted to try destroying the blood bone temple or see if there was anything hidden inside.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth pounced at the small blood bone temple fiercely. The highest point of the building only reached Tyrant Behemoth’s waist. Tyrant Behemoth activated its Absolute Strength and punched down from above, striking the wooden roof of the blood bone temple.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Before Tyrant Behemoth’s fist could smash into the wooden roof, an evil glow erupted from the blood bone temple. A black sanguine flame soared into the sky and forcefully blasted Tyrant Behemoth’s gigantic body into the air.</p>
<p>The blackish-red flames entrenched themselves above the blood bone temple and actually transformed into a blackish-red blood shadow. It looked like a large tortoise, but its claws were like that of a tiger or wolf. Its head was like a bird’s, and its tail was like an alligator’s with a tip resembling a scorpion’s stinger.</p>
<p>The blood figure looked sinister, evil, and oppressive.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth’s body was in midair when the blood figure jumped up as if it had disappeared. When it appeared again, it had already grabbed Tyrant Behemoth’s body and torn it into two.</p>
<p>Terror-grade! Zhou Wen was surprised.</p>
<p>The blood bone temple he had Tyrant Behemoth attack was already a very inconspicuous one. He didn’t expect a Terror-grade existence to be hidden inside.</p>
<p>If this weren’t a coincidence, it would be shocking enough with so many blood bone temples in Yang City—even if only half of them were at the Terror grade.</p>
<p>After the blood figure killed Tyrant Behemoth, it turned its gaze to the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wait for it to launch another attack; he summoned Banana Fairy.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy sat on the banana leaf that resembled a small boat. Her muslin clothes fluttered despite the lack of wind. She really looked like a fairy that had descended to the mortal world.</p>
<p>The blood figure went berserk again and swept toward Zhou Wen as a bloody beam. Banana Fairy’s red lips opened slightly as she exhaled a gust of Supreme Yin Wind.</p>
<p>The blood figure moved against the wind, and its charging speed became slower and slower. Furthermore, frost formed over its body. Finally, its entire body was wrapped in ice and blown away.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The frozen blood figure slammed into the wall of another blood bone temple, but it failed to break the mud brick wall. Instead, the blood bone temple lit up as a blood figure rushed out.</p>
<p>The blood figure that rushed out looked like a large snake, but its body was as large as a dragon’s. However, it didn’t have claws. Instead, it had a horn on its head.</p>
<p>The moment the blood-red snake appeared, it showed its prowess. It opened its mouth and spewed out blood-like river water that surged toward Zhou Wen and the others like a mountain flood.</p>
<p>Another Terror-grade! Zhou Wen was surprised and delighted.</p>
<p>Any creature that came out of the blood bone temples looked to be at the Terror grade. There were so many blood bone temples here, meaning that there were at least 200 to 300 Terror-grade creatures.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen, this was a holy land for grinding Companion Eggs and dimensional crystals.</p>
<p>However, it was unlikely that there weren’t any Calamity-grade creatures in such a terrifying place. If he encountered a Calamity-grade creature, Zhou Wen’s means of resistance would be very limited without the help of the Heavenly Robe.</p>
<p>After the blood shadow beast slammed into the wall, the ice around it shattered. Its body wasn’t too affected, but its actions looked a little stiff.</p>
<p>It got up from the ground and shook the ice fragments from its body. It opened its beak-like mouth and let out a strange scream, forming an aural ring that quickly spread out.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy was clearly a little peeved as she jumped down from the banana leaf and danced in front of Zhou Wen. She fanned the two monsters with the banana fan that was transformed from the banana leaf with one hand.</p>
<p>A terrifying Supreme Yin Wind swept out as the torrent-like blood froze. Even the sound waves were frozen in midair. With Banana Fairy as the origin, a fan-shaped area of ice was instantly formed. The two blood shadow-like Terror-grade creatures were frozen into ice sculptures and sent flying.</p>
<p>Their bodies slammed into the wall of a blood bone temple. This time, they failed to shatter the ice around them, but they also failed to destroy the temple.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Due to Banana Fairy’s fanning, the hundred-plus blood bone temples in the frozen area emitted terrifying black sanguine flames. Terrifying black and red blood shadows rushed out of the temples.</p>
<p>Every black and red blood shadow emitted a terrifying aura. Without a doubt, they were definitely at the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked around and didn’t see a single creature below the Terror grade. He was alarmed. What’s going on in Yang City? Why are there so many Terror-grade creatures?</p>
<h3 id='chapter1374'>Chapter 1374: Classic of Mountains and Seas Mutated Beasts</h3>
<p>More than a hundred devil-like Terror-grade creatures swept over as though they had a blood feud with Zhou Wen. They wished they could chew him up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the Prisoned Dragon armor. He quickly instant transmitted, but he only managed to dodge a portion of the attacks. Many attacks still landed on him.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Absolute Defense was indeed powerful. It fended off many fatal attacks and even reflected damage, sending a few devil-like blood shadows flying.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy waved the banana fan in her hand and used Chaos Wind to form countless tornadoes, sweeping up all the forces and blood shadows that approached her.</p>
<p>One of the bird-shaped blood shadows stood out by moving against the wind, unafraid of Banana Fairy’s Chaos Wind. It tore through the tornadoes that filled the sky and arrived near Banana Fairy. It spread its wings and blood beams shot at Banana Fairy like a rain of arrows.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy rode the wind and used the banana fan in her hand as a weapon. She blocked all the sanguine light that approached her and fought the blood shadow that resembled a giant bird.</p>
<p>However, she had clearly met her nemesis. The giant bird seemed to be born with the ability to fix the wind. Be it the Supreme Yang Wind, Supreme Yin Wind, or Chaos Wind, they would immediately stop the moment they reached the giant bird.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used the Prisoned Dragon armor’s defense to constantly set up the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, but before the invisible sword beams he set up could stabilize, they were shattered by the overwhelming power. He was unable to form a sword array.</p>
<p>Seeing that setting up the sword array was not going to work, Zhou Wen was just about to go all out when he heard a strange cry that resembled a bull or dragon. Before he could react, the blood-colored avatar’s eardrums ruptured before its entire body exploded, turning into a bloody mist.</p>
<p>Calamity-grade creature! Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>It wasn’t unexpected that there was a Calamity-grade creature in Yang City. However, he didn’t even see what the Calamity-grade creature was before he was killed by the sound. He was truly displeased.</p>
<p>He wanted to enter again, but the notification indicated that he had to wait 24 hours.</p>
<p>Since he couldn’t enter, Zhou Wen used his memories to search for information online. Soon, he realized that the blood shadows he saw in Yang City seemed to be extremely similar to some creatures in the Classic of Mountains and Seas.</p>
<p>Take the blood shadow that appeared in the beginning for instance, it was very similar to the Whirl Turtle in the Classic of Mountains and Seas. The other blood shadows also had inklings of the mutated beasts in the Classic of Mountains and Seas.</p>
<p>Could it be that the blood bone temples in Yang City are built with the bones of the mutated beasts in the Classic of Mountains and Seas? The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that he was right.</p>
<p>Back then, Yu the Great had controlled the waters, splitting mountains and rivers along the way. He had killed countless flood beasts. If there was anyone who was qualified to build such a city, it was probably only Yu the Great.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen thought of this, he was alarmed and delighted. He was delighted that he would definitely gain a lot from grinding Terror-grade Companion Beasts and dimensional crystals in such a treasure land in the future.</p>
<p>What was shocking was that if a Calamity-grade creature was about to appear in Yang City, it wouldn’t be easy to defend Luoyang.</p>
<p>Is there no safe place in the world that can let me game in peace? Zhou Wen sighed before throwing himself into grinding work again.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there were many places that Zhou Wen wanted to grind, but he didn’t have the ability to clear them.</p>
<p>For example, he could grind the first part of the Venusian instance dungeon and Chess Mountain, but he would die when he reached the end.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously attempted to kill the Ant City Guardian, but ended up being killed. The growth of the Ant City Guardian had probably placed it at the Calamity grade, making it seem to be faster than Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Once, when Zhou Wen really didn’t have any dungeons to grind, he ran to Mount Laojun. After entering Mount Laojun’s Golden Peak, he saw an immortal crane that ignored him.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t there to sightsee, so it was naturally impossible for him to just take a look. He went up to kill the immortal crane, but he was killed on the spot by a single wing. The game screen instantly turned black.</p>
<p>This can’t continue. I have to think of a way to kill a Calamity-grade Companion Beast. As long as I kill them enough times, a Calamity-grade Companion Beast will drop no matter what. A Calamity-grade Companion Beast makes everything easy. Zhou Wen really wanted to count on Truth Listener, but it had been in the form of an earring all this while. He couldn’t summon it no matter what.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen planned on thinking of a way to kill a Calamity-grade in-game after this trip to the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the Calamity-grade he had highest hopes of killing was the one on Venus.</p>
<p>The Calamity-grade’s offensive strength was indeed very strong. The seventh shot was almost a sure kill.</p>
<p>However, his weakness was obvious. His offensive abilities were single-target. Also, his defense was definitely mediocre, and his melee abilities were lacking. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have hidden the entire time.</p>
<p>Up to now, no one had seen what he looked like.</p>
<p>As long as one could deal with his bullets, killing him probably wasn’t difficult after finding him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had more or less finished his research on the infinite spatial circulation skill. The progress was very smooth. He believed that it wouldn’t be long before he could withstand the Calamity-grade bullets. When that happened, he would have the confidence to kill the Calamity creature.</p>
<p>Sweetie was rather curious about everything on Earth. She found everything fresh and fun, so she didn’t find it boring.</p>
<p>Finally, they arrived near the League of Guardians. Zhou Wen tried his best to hide his whereabouts and planned on secretly approaching the League of Guardians to set up his Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array.</p>
<p>However, with Sweetie by his side, it wasn’t that easy for him to hide.</p>
<p>“Shall we play a game?” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said to Sweetie.</p>
<p>“I’m not a child. Why are we playing games?” Sweetie immediately followed up with a question. “What game do you have in mind?”</p>
<p>“Let’s play hide-and-seek. The two of us will hide ourselves. Whoever gets discovered first loses,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Sweetie rolled her eyes at him. “Are you afraid of being discovered when attempting something evil?”</p>
<p>“Wow, you actually saw through me. Alright, I can only tell you the truth. I’m actually here to find treasure,” Zhou Wen whispered to Sweetie.</p>
<p>“What treasure?” Sweetie’s eyes lit up as though she was interested.</p>
<p>“In the city over there, there’s a group of villains known as the Forty Great Bandits. They pillage everywhere and gather many treasures, hiding them somewhere in the city. I came here this time to find the treasure of the Forty Great Bandits and distribute it to good people who need it,” Zhou Wen said in all seriousness.</p>
<p>“You want it for yourself, right?” Sweetie seemed to see through Zhou Wen’s thoughts.</p>
<p>“That’s not important. What’s important is to punish those bad people.” Zhou Wen wore a righteous expression as though he was a modern version of Justice Bao.</p>
<p>Noticing Sweetie’s hesitance, Zhou Wen hurriedly added, “With so many treasures, even if most of them are distributed to good people who need them, one-thousandth of the remaining can buy a few plum blossom cake shops.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1375'>Chapter 1375: Clear Plan</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen and Sweetie sneaked to the headquarters of the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>Under Zhou Wen’s persuasion and lies, Sweetie ended up tempted. She hid herself and followed Zhou Wen to the headquarters of the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen still needed to hide along the way, but it was easy for Sweetie. As long as she didn’t want anyone to see her, no one could see her.</p>
<p>How strange. Why isn’t Sweetie’s strength suppressed on Earth? Sweetie’s potent abilities puzzled Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, it shouldn’t have been like this. A Calamity-grade would be suppressed on Earth. If Sweetie was really an Apocalypse-grade big shot, she should be suppressed even more.</p>
<p>However, no matter how Zhou Wen looked at it, Sweetie didn’t seem to be suppressed by the rules.</p>
<p>The headquarters of the League of Guardians was huge. It was already considered a city. Many humans who had contracted Guardians could be seen coming and going.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array wasn’t strong enough to envelop such a huge city, so he could only enter its core first. He originally wanted to use the Invisibility Cloak to sneak in, but he felt that it wouldn’t work.</p>
<p>The Invisibility Cloak was only at the Mythical stage after all. There were many Terror-grade Guardians here, so it was difficult to guarantee that no one could see him.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen summoned Demonic Neonate. “te, get Grim Demon out.”</p>
<p>With a thought, Demonic Neonate automatically unsheathed the Demonic Sword in her arms. Grim Demon also flew out.</p>
<p>“Grim Demon, you should be able to transform into a Guardian armor and possess me, right?” Zhou Wen looked at Grim Demon and asked with uncertainty.</p>
<p>Typical Guardians could transform into armor, but Grim Demon had never done so. He was always inside the Demonic Sword, so Zhou Wen wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>“Yes, I can, but you haven’t contracted with me and can’t use my power,” Grim Demon said smugly. “Why? Do you need to use my power having encountered something that can’t be resolved? Didn’t I tell you so? If you had contracted with me back then… Of course… I wouldn’t have taken a fancy to you…”</p>
<p>“Cut the crap. Just transform into armor and attach yourself to me.” Zhou Wen glared at him.</p>
<p>Grim Demon naturally didn’t care if Zhou Wen glared at him, but when he turned his head and saw Demonic Neonate glaring at him, he immediately cowered. He smiled apologetically and said, “Of course. I’ll do it immediately.”</p>
<p>With that said, Grim Demon transformed into armor and enveloped Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>A black armor enveloped Zhou Wen’s body, making his slender and muscular body exude strength. It was as though he could shoot out like a cannonball with a single step.</p>
<p>“Piece of cake.” Zhou Wen decided to swagger into the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>After unsummoning Demonic Neonate, Zhou Wen led Sweetie to the entrance that resembled a toll booth on a highway. That was the only way to enter the League of Guardians. Unless Zhou Wen forcefully barged in, he had to go through there.</p>
<p>As for using instant transmission, Zhou Wen didn’t believe that with Cave Era and Jiuyue around, they would allow anyone to teleport into the headquarters of the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>As there were many humans who had contracted Guardians entering and exiting, Zhou Wen felt that there shouldn’t be too much of a problem since he was wearing authentic Guardian armor.</p>
<p>“See that? There are solutions to everything. You don’t have to force it. It’s not easy for me to sneak in. You still have a lot to learn.” Zhou Wen walked among the Guardians and no one paid attention to him. There were people wearing Guardian armor everywhere. Zhou Wen was inconspicuous, so he happily lectured Sweetie.</p>
<p>However, just as he entered, he heard an ear-piercing alarm.</p>
<p>Instantly, the Guardians around him looked over. The Guardians in charge of sentry duty also surrounded Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Where’s your pass?” one of the guards asked Zhou Wen with an unfriendly expression.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen cursed inwardly. He never expected the League of Guardians to have such high-tech stuff. He was secretly depressed. Why are a bunch of Guardians dabbling with high-tech stuff? There’s actually such a thing as an entry pass!?</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Sweetie’s face turned red from holding back her laughter. However, she ultimately failed to hold it in and laughed out loud.</p>
<p>However, no matter how she laughed, no one else reacted other than Zhou Wen. It was as though they couldn’t see Sweetie at all.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice. There was no time for him to get the entry card now. Since he had already been exposed, he planned on rushing in.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to take action, he heard a person squeeze out from the crowd beside him. As he squeezed over, he said, “Sorry, his entry pass is with me. I was holding it for him. I forgot to return it to him when I returned.”</p>
<p>As the person spoke, he stuffed a card into Zhou Wen’s hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen caught the card and the shrill alarm immediately stopped.</p>
<p>“Be careful next time. Don’t randomly leave the entry pass around. If anything happens, you won’t even know how you died.” The leading guard saw that the entry passes on Zhou Wen and the person were fine, so all he did was lecture them.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry,” the person apologized.</p>
<p>“Alright, go in. Don’t delay others from entering.” Only then did the guard let them in.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed the person in. When they came to an area with fewer people and no one was paying attention to them, Zhou Wen approached the person and lowered his voice. He asked in puzzlement, “Jiang Yan, why are you here?”</p>
<p>The person who helped Zhou Wen out was none other than Jiang Yan, one of Wang Mingyuan’s students when Zhou Wen was learning from him.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan said, “I contracted a Guardian, so I’m naturally considered a member of the League of Guardians. I’m now doing some idle work in the headquarters. As for you, you are one of the League of Guardians’ greatest enemies. Why didn’t you stay in Luoyang? Why did you come here yourself?”</p>
<p>“Thankfully, you are here. If it wasn’t for you, I would be in trouble.” Zhou Wen was telling the truth.</p>
<p>Although he wasn’t afraid of the League of Guardians and it wasn’t difficult for him to escape, he wouldn’t be able to set up the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array ahead of time if he was discovered ahead of time. It would also make the League of Guardians wary. It wouldn’t be easy to attack again.</p>
<p>“You’re my junior brother after all. I can’t just ignore you when I notice that you’re in danger.” Jiang Yan smiled and said, “No matter what you’re doing here, you have to be careful. It’s beyond imagination how many Terror-grade Guardians are here. If anything happens, it won’t be easy to escape.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t plan on fighting those Guardians to the death,” Zhou Wen said to Jiang Yan. “What do you do in the League of Guardians? If you encounter an enemy attack, will you fight?”</p>
<p>“I’m not a guard. I’m just a clerk. Under normal circumstances, I don’t have to fight,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>“That’s good. When I fight them later, don’t you come out. Think of a way to leave this place. It’s best if you apply for leave in advance…” Zhou Wen exhorted.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll hide far away. What do you want to do? Don’t tell me you really think that you can send shockwaves through the League of Guardians alone?” Jiang Yan asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Why not? I want to turn the League of Guardians upside down and smash that so-called Immortal’s lair singlehandedly,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1376'>Chapter 1376: Immortal</h3>
<p>“You really have what it takes to do that.” Jiang Yan laughed. “However, you still have to be careful. Immortal’s strength is extraordinary, and he has so many helpers. He’s not easy to deal with.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to worry about that. Even if I can’t beat them, I can still run. As for you, you helped me out today. Will they investigate you in the future? Also, will there be a problem with the card you gave me?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. That card isn’t registered with a name. They won’t be able to find me easily. Even if they do, no one can do anything to me without actual evidence. After all, I’m Cave Era’s younger brother,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>“You are Cave Era’s younger brother? Blood-related?” Zhou Wen widened his eyes.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Jiang Yan said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself that it was a close call. Thankfully, he hadn’t had the chance to kill Cave Era; otherwise, he would probably have had a death grudge with Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen’s expression, Jiang Yan seemed to guess what he was thinking. He said to Zhou Wen, “She’s my sister after all. If there’s no deep grudge between the two of you, let her live if you encounter her in the future.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Jiang Yan smiled and said, “If it were anyone else, I definitely wouldn’t make such a request. However, you’re different. You aren’t someone who likes to kill, and you have the ability to do so.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen nodded without saying anything else.</p>
<p>“It’s been a long time since we last met. I wanted to chat with you, but the present time and place don’t allow for it. Let’s chat in the future.” Jiang Yan looked up and pointed in a direction. “If you encounter a hopeless situation, run in that direction. There might be a way out.”</p>
<p>“What’s there?” Zhou Wen also looked in that direction, but he didn’t see anything there. It wasn’t the center of the city.</p>
<p>“If I tell you what’s there, it won’t work. If you don’t need to take that step, it’s useless even if you know. If you need to take that step, you will naturally know when the time comes.” With that said, Jiang Yan reached out and pressed his hand on Zhou Wen’s shoulder. He said seriously, “You aren’t a killer. The past you resembles your true self.”</p>
<p>“I also wish to game in peace every day, but this world doesn’t leave me any peace,” Zhou Wen said helplessly.</p>
<p>“That’s true. Life is unpredictable. Who can stay away from that all? I’m leaving. Be careful.” Jiang Yan lowered his hand and turned to leave.</p>
<p>“I’ll later…” Zhou Wen wanted to say something, but he was interrupted by Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me anything. I don’t want to know. At least not now.” Jiang Yan left without looking back.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shrugged. He hadn’t planned on explaining his plan to begin with. He only wanted to tell Jiang Yan not to get too close to the sword array he would set up.</p>
<p>“Where’s the treasure you mentioned?” Sweetie couldn’t help but ask. She scanned the area for a while but didn’t find any treasure.</p>
<p>“If it was that easy to find it, it wouldn’t be called a treasure. Follow me.” Zhou Wen led Sweetie towards the center of the League of Guardians as he secretly set up the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array.</p>
<p>After Jiang Yan and Zhou Wen separated, he didn’t head to the center of the headquarters. Instead, he left the headquarters and headed for the location of Skysplit Tower.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to reach Skysplit Tower, Jiang Yan summoned the Guardian armor and put it on. At the same time, he extended his hand and a cloak-like robe appeared in it.</p>
<p>He draped the robe over his shoulder and a mask appeared in his other hand at some point in time. Although he was protected by the face armor, Jiang Yan still put the mask on his face and finally put the hood up.</p>
<p>After doing all of this, Jiang Yan walked towards Skysplit Tower.</p>
<p>“Lord Immortal,” the Guardians guarding the area immediately bowed and said respectfully when they saw Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen probably never expected Jiang Yan to be Immortal. He had even said in front of Jiang Yan that he wanted to destroy Immortal’s den.</p>
<p>“Where are Uesugi and Cave Era?” Jiang Yan asked.</p>
<p>“Lord Immortal, Lord Uesugi and Cave Era are supervising the seventh floor of Skysplit Tower. Lord Blood Shaman is also here,” the guard answered.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan nodded slightly before walking into Skysplit Tower.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen set up the sword array as he walked through the headquarters of the League of Guardians, but he quickly realized that there weren’t as many high-level Guardians as he imagined.</p>
<p>Although the League of Guardians had suffered heavy losses previously and had lost the ability to bring Guardians to Earth through Skysplit Tower, it wouldn’t be the case of him not seeing a single Terror-grade Guardian after walking for so long, right?</p>
<p>Strange, there doesn’t seem to be any ambushes. Why don’t I see any high-level Guardians? Where did those Guardians go? Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to listen carefully for a while and realized that there weren’t any high-level Guardians nearby. And this was already the center of the headquarters.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment before his eyes lit up. I get it. The League of Guardians must be rebuilding Skysplit Tower. Apart from Skysplit Tower, there shouldn’t be any other huge project that can make the League of Guardians mobilize so many high-level Guardians.</p>
<p>I wonder if Skysplit Tower is still where it used to be? Zhou Wen only knew where its former location was.</p>
<p>However, according to An Sheng, the compressed and accelerated Essence Energy Bomb which had wiped out the An family’s savings had completely destroyed Skysplit Tower. It was almost impossible to repair it.</p>
<p>The construction of Skysplit Tower took several years previously. Considering the many materials needed, it was no longer easy to obtain them. It would probably take at least eight to ten years to rebuild Skysplit Tower.</p>
<p>If they really went to repair Skysplit Tower, it means that it definitely won’t take that long to rebuild it. Otherwise, it would be impossible for them to invest so much manpower. Zhou Wen knew very well.</p>
<p>The League of Guardians needed a large number of people to operate. It was fine to temporarily deploy so many high-level Guardians. If they were to spend eight to ten years building Skysplit Tower, the League of Guardians would probably be crippled.</p>
<p>There was only one possibility for such a situation to happen. Skysplit Tower could be repaired in a short period of time. At the very least, a portion of it could be repaired, allowing Skysplit Tower to play a certain role.</p>
<p>This won’t do. I have to visit Skysplit Tower. Otherwise, there’s no point in destroying their headquarters. Zhou Wen gave up on his previous plans and headed for the old Skysplit Tower.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen only hoped that they were repairing the original Skysplit Tower. If they were to switch locations to repair it, he might not be able to find the new Skysplit Tower.</p>
<p>“Where are you going? Aren’t you looking for treasure here?” Sweetie asked in puzzlement when she saw Zhou Wen walking out of the city.</p>
<p>“I thought of a place. Perhaps those fellows hid the treasure there,” Zhou Wen said as he walked towards Skysplit Tower.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw the Skysplit Tower which was being repaired from afar, he knew that his guess was right.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1377'>Chapter 1377: I Need Help</h3>
<p>“Your Excellency.” Blood Shaman, Uesugi Nao, and Cave Era immediately bowed when they saw Immortal walking over.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan passed by the three of them and walked to the fence. He looked up at a pillar in the middle of Skysplit Tower. The pillar was made of metal and crystal. Although it was erected in the middle of Skysplit Tower, its current height had exceeded the completed seventh floor.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan stood by the fence on the seventh floor. He had to look up at the Heavenly Ascension Platform to barely see its peak.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, it should be completed in twenty days at the current progress,” Uesugi Nao said from behind.</p>
<p>“That’s too late,” Jiang Yan muttered to himself.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, taking another twenty days makes it only twenty-seven days. It won’t even be a month,” Uesugi Nao said in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan didn’t explain as he said calmly, “All of you can leave. Guard Skysplit Tower outside and don’t let anyone approach.”</p>
<p>The three of them were alarmed as Blood Shaman hurriedly asked, “Your Excellency, what happened?”</p>
<p>“Go. Just guard it well,” Jiang Yan said indifferently as he looked at the Heavenly Ascension Platform without explaining.</p>
<p>“Yes.” With Jiang Yan saying that, Uesugi Nao and company didn’t dare ask further as they left Skysplit Tower together.</p>
<p>Before walking down from the seventh floor, Cave Era looked at Jiang Yan as though she wanted to say something, but she ultimately didn’t. She followed Blood Shaman and company down Skysplit Tower.</p>
<p>Although Jiang Yan didn’t say anything, they knew that something must have happened. Otherwise, Immortal wouldn’t have said that. Therefore, they immediately gathered all the Guardians in Skysplit Tower and began setting up defenses around it.</p>
<p>After all the people who had rebuilt Skysplit Tower left, Jiang Yan walked to the bottom of the huge heavenly pillar and climbed the steps that surrounded the stone pillar, walking towards the top of the Heavenly Ascension Platform.</p>
<p>Now, only a third of the Heavenly Ascension Platform had been built. The highest point was still under construction, but when Jiang Yan arrived at the highest point, he could already look down at his surroundings.</p>
<p>There’s too little time. Although ascending to the heavens in a single step is difficult, I can only give it a try. Jiang Yan looked up into the void, and on the forehead of the Guardian armor he wore, there was a crystal that was as mysterious as a vertical eye that emitted a strange light.</p>
<p>The crystal that resembled an eye seemed to be an endless abyss. Any ray of light that landed on it would be absorbed. However, it emitted a faint light that resembled tentacles. When the light reached it, it was like hair-like tentacles stabbing into the void.</p>
<p>The unfinished pillar at Jiang Yan’s feet came into contact with the tentacle-like beam. The crystal embedded in the metal that looked like a pattern gradually lit up.</p>
<p>As the sky above the Heavenly Ascension Platform lit up, the crystal that resembled an eye on Jiang Yan’s forehead became darker. As for the tentacle-like rays of light, they increased in number, spreading out like countless transparent strands of hair. They filled the void and spread to unknown areas.</p>
<p>The rays of light would flash with strange streams of light from time to time, like cables that transmitted signals. The stronger the light from the Heavenly Ascension Platform, the stronger the streams of light.</p>
<p>As for Jiang Yan, he seemed to be enduring extreme pain as his body involuntarily trembled slightly. His eyes were bloodshot and even the capillaries under his skin began to rupture.</p>
<p>Blood Shaman and company, who were guarding outside Skysplit Tower, were alarmed when they saw the Heavenly Ascension Platform glowing brightly, but the top seemed to be enveloped by darkness.</p>
<p>“We’ve only completed a third of the Heavenly Ascension Platform, so its effects are greatly discounted. Isn’t it too risky for Lord Immortal to use it to contact the dimension?” Blood Shaman exclaimed.</p>
<p>“In order to contact the dimension, one needs to pay a huge price with energy. Skysplit Tower itself is an energy-gathering device, while the Heavenly Ascension Platform is like a signal amplifier. Even without the energy-gathering effects of Skysplit Tower, as long as one has enough energy, one can use the Heavenly Ascension Platform’s signal amplification ability to contact the dimension. However, even if there’s an amplification effect, one needs extremely potent energy to succeed. Now, there’s only a third or even lower magnification effect. It’s difficult to say if the signal can be sent to the dimension. If something goes wrong and the energy isn’t sent out, Lord Immortal will be in danger if the energy rebounds on him,” Uesugi Nao said worriedly.</p>
<p>Cave Era seemed to have already figured out what Jiang Yan was up to. At that moment, she was the calmest person.</p>
<p>“Since Lord Immortal dares to do so, he naturally has his own plans. Let’s guard Skysplit Tower and not let anyone disturb him, lest we fail, bringing everything to naught.” Cave Era knew that Jiang Yan’s words weren’t without reason.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao and Blood Shaman nodded slightly and increased their vigilance. At the same time, they informed the headquarters to transfer the high-level Guardians stationed at the headquarters.</p>
<p>Now, even if the headquarters of the League of Guardians was flattened, it wouldn’t be a loss.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>On the Heavenly Ascension Platform, cracks began to appear on Jiang Yan’s Guardian armor. As his body suffered the terrifying power that seeped through the cracks, his skin rapidly turned gray. His originally crystalline skin instantly turned to dust as specks flew out with the spatial fluctuations.</p>
<p>The Heavenly Ascension Platform hadn’t been completed. It wasn’t as simple as only having a third of its operational effects. The incomplete Heavenly Ascension Platform was extremely harmful to the user.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan ignored his body that was turning gray as he continued staring at the void that was penetrated by the light.</p>
<p>Kacha!</p>
<p>Cracks appeared on the crystal on the Guardian’s forehead. This was due to the direct impact of the Heavenly Ascension Platform’s amplification.</p>
<p>Please, it’ll be done soon. Hold on a little longer. Jiang Yan prayed silently.</p>
<p>However, the cracks on the crystal continued to increase. Soon, they filled the entire crystal. The crystal was like a glass ball that had been burned by fire before being soaked in cold water. Countless cracks crisscrossed. With just a little more energy, it would instantly disintegrate.</p>
<p>Just a little more… Just a little more… Jiang Yan stared intently into the void. At the spot where his armor had cracked, the exposed parts of his body had already turned gray and revealed white bones, but he still didn’t notice anything.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a strange light spread out from the spot where the light penetrated, forming a humanoid figure of light. It was as though a god that couldn’t be stared at by humans had descended.</p>
<p>“Jiang Yan, is this the answer you are giving me?” The figure looked down from above and coldly stared at the unfinished Skysplit Tower and Heavenly Ascension Platform.</p>
<p>“I’ve encountered some trouble and need help,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>“I’ve given you enough help. If I need to resolve everything myself, what else do I need you for? Are you telling me that I need another representative in the human world?” the figure of light said coldly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1378'>Chapter 1378: A Human</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“I believe in your foresight and know what I can do. Even if you were to change to another representative, they wouldn’t do better than me,” Jiang Yan said without fear.</p>
<p>“Ranked second last on the Cube, the destruction of Skysplit Tower. Even the federal government can’t be fully controlled. Is this what you can do?” the figure of light said disdainfully.</p>
<p>“What’s so important about controlling the federal government? What’s the point of me controlling the federal government? Even the Holy Temple hasn’t been able to completely control the six families that we really need to control after so many years, much less me, who has only controlled the League of Guardians for a few years.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Jiang Yan continued, “The Cube’s current ranking doesn’t mean anything. If I’m willing, I can be ranked in the top three now, but so what if I’m in the top three? My goal is first place, and it’s the same for you, isn’t that so? Without first place, it’s useless no matter how high my ranking is. Therefore, I need more time to observe. Of course, if you are willing to provide me with potent strength, I believe it won’t be difficult for me to reach first place now.</p>
<p>“As for the destruction of Skysplit Tower, it’s indeed my fault. However, from the fact that Skysplit Tower can be destroyed, you should be able to understand what kind of enemy I’m facing. You should have seen human powerhouses like Human Sovereign and Deceit King through the Cube. It’s very difficult for Terror-grade powerhouses to fight such a human powerhouse. It’s not that I don’t want to do anything, but our strength is indeed lacking.”</p>
<p>“What else do you want? A Calamity-grade Guardian? If I can send a Calamity-grade Guardian into Earth, what do I need you for? Even if I were to give you a pig, it could sweep through all of humanity,” the figure said coldly.</p>
<p>“If that’s what you think, please wait a moment and decide if you want to change the spokesperson after watching everything.” Jiang Yan wasn’t affected by the figure of light, still looking indifferent.</p>
<p>“What do you want me to see?” the figure asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“A human. My opponent,” Jiang Yan answered.</p>
<p>“Human Sovereign or Deceit King? You want me to help you deal with them? That’s your job to begin with. Otherwise, what would I need you for?” the figure said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Neither.” Jiang Yan cast his gaze outside Skysplit Tower. At that moment, there seemed to be a strange change happening clandestinely outside Skysplit Tower. After taking a look, Jiang Yan continued, “One’s strength dictates what they can do. I can deal with a single Human Sovereign. Even with another Deceit King, I can also think of a solution, but what if there are more and more humans like them? Don’t you think that the help you provide isn’t as useful as you imagine in front of such humans?”</p>
<p>“Are you joking? How many humans like Human Sovereign and Deceit King can you find?” the figure said unhappily.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how many there are, but one has already arrived,” Jiang Yan said calmly as he looked into the distance.</p>
<p>The figure couldn’t help but follow Jiang Yan’s gaze and indeed, he saw something flying over from afar.</p>
<p>On careful look, he immediately realized that a banana leaf that resembled a tiny boat was slowly sliding across the sky. The sky resembled water, like a boat cruising across the sky.</p>
<p>At the stern of the ship, a beautiful girl dressed in muslin clothes that made her look like a fairy was waving her sleeves like a boatman rowing a boat.</p>
<p>A young man stood at the bow of the ship, staring at the unfinished Skysplit Tower.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that human the one who relied on luck to clear the Venusian dimensional zone? Don’t tell me that you can’t even deal with such a person and you want me to help you? If that’s the case, your existence has no more value,” the figure recognized Zhou Wen and snorted coldly.</p>
<p>“There’s no rush. Keep watching,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>Upon realizing Zhou Wen’s appearance, Blood Shaman, Cave Era, and Uesugi Nao’s hearts tightened. However, when they saw that Zhou Wen was alone, they heaved a sigh of relief. The girl who had carried him over was a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you actually dare come here?” Cave Era stared at Zhou Wen and said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>With Hermit killed, Zhou Wen could be considered the archenemy of the League of Guardians. Cave Era yearned to skin him alive.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen smiled without a word. He stood on the banana leaf and observed Cave Era’s expression, hoping to guess her thoughts.</p>
<p>The thoughts Truth Listener could hear needed to be from extremely intense psychological fluctuations. If not for the emotional upheavals, Truth Listener would hardly be able to hear their thoughts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if he could hear them, it was only an ability. What Zhou Wen needed wasn’t just an ability, but innate sharp senses and the ability to manipulate the enemy’s state of mind. Just knowing what the enemy was thinking wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen still needed to rely on himself to reach the realm of Heart Slaying.</p>
<p>As he observed Cave Era’s words and actions and the minute expressions on her face, Zhou Wen realized many things that he hadn’t noticed before.</p>
<p>It turned out that a person’s emotions weren’t what he had imagined. Although their facial expressions were the most varied, their body language was richer than their expressions when it came to emotions.</p>
<p>Apart from anger, it was difficult to see any other emotions on Cave Era’s face. However, from her body language, he could interpret more.</p>
<p>For example, Zhou Wen noticed something. Although Cave Era was expressing her anger, her legs were in a posture of retracting. This wasn’t a sign of a preparatory attack. At the very least, her posture wasn’t beneficial for attacking.</p>
<p>From this, it could be inferred that Cave Era was subconsciously afraid of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Of course, this was something that ordinary people with meticulous sensitivity could tell. It wasn’t difficult for Zhou Wen to notice this. It wasn’t that easy to improve further by perfectly interpreting one’s thoughts through body language.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen didn’t know if this was the right path. Regardless, it was a good start. With a goal, no matter if the path was right or wrong, the scenery along the way was a boon.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen remain silent as he stood on the banana leaf that resembled a tiny boat and looking down at her with a teasing expression, she couldn’t help but be enraged. “Shoot him down. This place isn’t a place for an outsider to act all presumptuous.”</p>
<p>After the dozens of Terror-grade Guardians gathered nearby received the order, they began gathering their strength to strike Zhou Wen down from the sky.</p>
<p>What should I do to make my opponent feel a fear worse than death? Zhou Wen’s mind raced as invisible sword beams appeared.. They appeared and disappeared like shimmering stars that instantly filled the nearby space, enveloping the entire area near Skysplit Tower.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1379'>Chapter 1379: Infinite Sword Beams</h3>
<p>Getting Zhou Wen to consider how to defeat the enemy or how to defeat the enemy most effectively was much easier than letting him consider how to stoke fear in people.</p>
<p>In essence, Zhou Wen was a pacifist. If he hadn’t been born in such an era, he wouldn’t even be willing to kill a chicken, much less kill a human.</p>
<p>However, this was how the times were. It brought about heroes. Many times, people who ended up heroes might not be people who wanted to become heroes.</p>
<p>Alright, let’s start with the basics. Zhou Wen really couldn’t figure out how to make the enemy feel a fear worse than death. He decided to start with the simplest solution.</p>
<p>With a thought from Zhou Wen, the Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array stirred as the star-like invisible sword beams fell crazily.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had arrived late because he had spent a lot of time condensing invisible sword aura to set up the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array.</p>
<p>The universe was infinite; same for the stars. It was the same for the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array. The more invisible sword beams that formed the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, the stronger it became. There was nothing redundant, nor would it be uncontrollable.</p>
<p>However, there was still a flaw between the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array and the real Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array.</p>
<p>The true Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array could automatically reform. In other words, all the shattered powers in the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array would automatically reform and be put to combat again.</p>
<p>The Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array didn’t work. Once the invisible sword beam was shattered, it couldn’t reform itself. Zhou Wen had to condense it himself a second time.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array had its advantages. The Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array could absorb all the energy and reform itself, but the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array couldn’t. As for the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array being a protective stellar array, it could absorb large amounts of energy and provide it for Zhou Wen to use.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The dense rain of invisible sword beams constantly descended, attacking all the Guardians, including the Skysplit Tower. The invisible sword beams were everywhere.</p>
<p>The Guardians who were about to attack Zhou Wen suddenly realized that they were facing invisible sword beams that resembled a flood. They couldn’t divert their attention.</p>
<p>With such a large-scale attack, no one believed that Zhou Wen would be able to last long. They even believed that there would only be one round of invisible sword beams.</p>
<p>Such Essence Energy expenditure was not something a Terror-grade could withstand. To them, it was already unbelievable that Zhou Wen could release one round of invisible sword beams.</p>
<p>Every Guardian used all their strength to shatter the invisible sword beams that were rushing at them. With the determination to fight to the death, they wanted to break through the sword array and charge at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, they soon realized that they had been too naive. The invisible sword beams constantly fell without any gaps as though they were infinite.</p>
<p>Pfft!</p>
<p>Just a few hits by the invisible sword beams left some Guardians collapsing. Blood spewed out of their mouths as the Guardian armor on their bodies was penetrated by the invisible sword beams.</p>
<p>Once they lost their ability to resist, they were constantly struck by the invisible sword beams and nailed to the ground.</p>
<p>Cave Era wanted to penetrate the invisible sword beams to attack Zhou Wen by using her Time Acceleration ability, but she was alarmed to discover that the invisible sword beams were so dense that it was almost gapless. Even if there was a gap, the narrow gap wasn’t enough to fit her body.</p>
<p>Helpless, Cave Era could only use all her strength to resist the invisible sword beams. She didn’t even have room to dodge.</p>
<p>The Guardians were like drowning in a torrent, alarmed and helpless.</p>
<p>This was under the condition that Zhou Wen didn’t have the intention to kill. Otherwise, more than half of these Terror-grade Guardians would have been killed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen spared their lives not because of his kindness. He only wanted to observe their emotions and advance Slaughterer.</p>
<p>Just because he didn’t kill didn’t mean that he didn’t do anything else. As he attacked the Guardians, a large number of invisible sword beams struck Skysplit Tower and the Heavenly Ascension Platform.</p>
<p>In just a moment, the Skysplit Tower that had just been rebuilt to seven levels was nailed with dense, invisible sword beams.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The seven-story Skysplit Tower finally collapsed under the relentless bombardment of invisible sword beams. The ground quaked as though it was the dawn of the apocalypse.</p>
<p>The Terror-grade Guardians that should have left others terrified were filled with terror.</p>
<p>Never had there been a human who was as terrifying as Zhou Wen. He had blasted apart Skysplit Tower with his own strength and suppressed dozens of Terror-grade Guardians.</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhou Wen was no longer human in their eyes.</p>
<p>Impossible… That fellow is definitely not a pure human… Blood Shaman’s body was covered in injuries as he was horrified.</p>
<p>He could seal Companion Beasts, but Zhou Wen wasn’t using them at all. Just the power of the invisible sword beams gave him an overwhelming advantage.</p>
<p>Amidst the invisible sword beams, Blood Shaman felt like a tiny boat rocking in a stormy sea that could shatter at any moment.</p>
<p>Is the advancement as a pure human that strong? Uesugi Nao’s body was like a phantom. The invisible sword beams passed through her body without injuring her.</p>
<p>Great Skyfiend’s Terror transformation gave her the power and ability to ignore the invisible sword beams.</p>
<p>However, Uesugi Nao was reeling in shock and didn’t dare approach Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>More and more Guardians fell in the sword array. Skysplit Tower had already mostly collapsed. Even its foundation was about to be flattened.</p>
<p>They didn’t register any feelings during Skysplit Tower’s previous destruction because of the short time span in which it happened. It had been destroyed in one shot.</p>
<p>However, this time, it was blasted apart by invisible sword beams. The visual impact and shock of those who witnessed this scene far exceeded the previous time.</p>
<p>In their eyes, the present Zhou Wen was like a terrifying devil—nothing like a human.</p>
<p>The only thing that wasn’t affected by the invisible sword beams was the Heavenly Ascension Platform. All the invisible sword beams that struck the Heavenly Ascension Platform seemed to collide with a mysterious force. They shattered before they touched its pillars.</p>
<p>The figure on the rooftop was also surprised.</p>
<p>“Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array? That’s not right. It’s a little different. Strange. Without the power of a Calamity-grade Zone, how can one set up the Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array at such scale? It’s impossible for one’s Essence Energy to keep up with the expenditure. Even dimensional creatures born from Essence Energy can’t have such abundant Essence Energy…” The figure seemed to understand Jiang Yan’s words.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Jiang Yan was lacking, but that the enemy was too terrifying.</p>
<p>Thinking of Human Sovereign, Deceit King, and Zhou Wen, it was indeed not easy for Jiang Yan to last until now with such humans as enemies of the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>“I think you can understand my predicament, right? I do need support,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>“Calamity-grade Guardians can’t enter Earth. Even if they do, their strength will be greatly suppressed. It won’t be of any use,” the figure said after some thought.</p>
<p>“If you don’t mind, I’m willing to use myself as a container to welcome you into the world and cleanse the filth here.” Jiang Yan held his hand to his chest and bowed slightly as he spoke sincerely.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1380'>Chapter 1380: Perfect Sword Immortal</h3>
<p>“Do you know that if I were to descend upon you, your body would definitely be severely damaged or even irreversibly damaged?” the figure said as it stared at Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>“I do,” Jiang Yan said calmly. “An existence like you has power that far exceeds the limits of Earth’s rules. It’s naturally not something my body can withstand. It’s inevitable that there will be damage.”</p>
<p>“Since you know, why do you want me to use your body to descend?” The figure clearly doubted Jiang Yan’s request.</p>
<p>However, Jiang Yan smiled and said, “So what? Compared to this tiny sacrifice, I can obtain more, right?”</p>
<p>“Oh, what do you want to obtain?” the figure asked.</p>
<p>“My Guardian, Skyimmortal, is a Guardian created by the genes of the Immortals, and you are a powerful existence of the Immortals. If you were to descend on me, with your strength, you should be able to advance Skyimmortal to the Calamity grade in an extremely short period of time. After you leave, as the contractor of the Skyimmortal, I naturally will have the power of the Calamity grade. In comparison, that tiny injury is nothing,” Jiang Yan said calmly.</p>
<p>The figure stared at Jiang Yan for a while before saying, “As expected of Wang Mingyuan’s disciple. You’re indeed a smart person. I can help you advance to the Calamity grade, but this is the last time I’ll make an exception to help you. If you have any similar problems that can’t be resolved in the future, I’ll consider changing the representative.”</p>
<p>“If I have the power of a Calamity-grade and still can’t dominate everything, there’s no need for you to do anything. I’ll just commit suicide,” Jiang Yan said firmly.</p>
<p>“In that case, I’ll use your body to temporarily descend to Earth. Remember, my name is Perfect Sword Immortal.” As he spoke, the figure slowly walked towards Jiang Yan, his gaze fixed on him.</p>
<p>Perfect Sword Immortal was taking the initiative to use Jiang Yan’s body. Theoretically speaking, he had the absolute initiative. Furthermore, with his strength and realm, it was enough to crush Jiang Yan. Even if Jiang Yan had ulterior motives, it would be difficult for him to do anything.</p>
<p>However, Perfect Sword Immortal was still very careful. If he discovered anything amiss, he would directly kill Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>However, Jiang Yan didn’t do anything abnormal. He spread out his arms as though he was a fanatic who was wholeheartedly sacrificing himself. He didn’t hold back at all as he completely presented his body in front of Perfect Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>Seeing that Jiang Yan was so unreserved, Perfect Sword Immortal felt relieved. The figure formed by light walked in front of Jiang Yan and overlapped with his body.</p>
<p>As immortal light flowed, the immortal armor around Jiang Yan’s body emitted an immortal aura as it rapidly transformed.</p>
<p>Dimensional creatures would be suppressed by the rules of Earth, but humans weren’t beholden to the rules. With Jiang Yan’s body, Perfect Sword Immortal descended on Earth. Although Jiang Yan’s body was too weak and he couldn’t unleash 100% of his combat strength, he could still unleash the combat strength of a Calamity-grade through the Skyimmortal armor.</p>
<p>Immortal light flowed as sword beams flowed like a river. Jiang Yan’s eyes changed. They were completely different from the deep, calm eyes from before. Replacing them was a gaze that was as sharp as a sword.</p>
<p>Perfect Sword Immortal extended his palm and clenched his fingers. He muttered to himself, “Jiang Yan is a tactful fellow. It’s quite rare for him to offer up his body without any reservations. In comparison, his abilities aren’t weak. He can be considered a usable person. Human Sovereign, Deceit King, Zhou Wen, and the rest are indeed powerful. I wonder where they came from. Ordinary Terror-grade creatures can’t compare with any of them. It’s indeed difficult for Jiang Yan to resolve the problem with such strength. I do need to help him advance to the Calamity grade…”</p>
<p>Outside Skysplit Tower, Zhou Wen’s sword array constantly attacked as Guardians were struck down by the invisible sword beams.</p>
<p>However, they weren’t killed. Their bodies were pierced by the invisible sword beams and they were nailed to the ground. Only five or six Guardians remained to resist.</p>
<p>Blood Shaman was covered in blood as his body was stabbed by many invisible sword beams. His situation was the most tragic.</p>
<p>Cave Era relied on the magical powers of time. Although she wasn’t injured, her situation wasn’t good either.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao controlled the Great Skyfiend armor as her figure passed through the numerous invisible sword beams and circled behind Zhou Wen. Her hand was like a ghastly claw as she stabbed at Zhou Wen’s head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen moved his body and dodged Uesugi Nao’s attack. Uesugi Nao followed up with a deluge of attacks after her first strike.</p>
<p>Her movement technique made her appear and disappear like a ghost as she constantly appeared around Zhou Wen. Her attacks were unpredictable.</p>
<p>However, no matter how her attacks changed, she failed to touch Zhou Wen at all.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, the Guardians felt their hearts turn cold. Only then did they recall that Zhou Wen’s Heavenly Robe could even dodge a Calamity-grade attack, much less Uesugi Nao, who was only at the Terror grade.</p>
<p>In fact, it was purely because Zhou Wen’s movement technique was excellent that he dodged all the attacks. It wasn’t because of the Heavenly Robe.</p>
<p>Of course, Heavenly Robe still played a role. However, without the Invincible Lucky Star, the chances of Heavenly Robe’s Lucky Dodge weren’t high. Zhou Wen had to dodge most of it himself.</p>
<p>Cave Era and company didn’t know this. They only believed that the Heavenly Robe was still the same as before—capable of dodging Calamity-grade attacks. They couldn’t help but feel despair.</p>
<p>The extremely terrifying destructive invisible sword beams and the Heavenly Robe which could dodge any attack, and the perfect, strong Zhou Wen left them without any hope.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that Slaughterer seemed to tremble because of his actions, but the vibrations weren’t too great. It wasn’t as intense as the last time Zhou Wen had comprehended the Heart-Slaying principle.</p>
<p>Clearly, this method of intimidation didn’t have much effect on Slaughterer’s advancement.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was thinking about how to improve, he suddenly realized that the black hole on the Heaven Ascension Platform had vanished. The light on the Heaven Ascension Platform dimmed as a figure tore through the air.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a careful look and realized that the person walking over was wearing a mask and a white robe. His attire was very similar to the League of Guardians’ Lord Immortal he had seen before.</p>
<p>The reason it was only very similar was that the Guardian armor on his body now seemed to be somewhat different.</p>
<p>The Guardian armor emitted a golden immortal glow, making him look like an immortal that had walked out of the immortal clouds.</p>
<p>This fellow seems a little odd. Why does it feel a little different from before? With a thought, Zhou Wen sent a large number of invisible sword beams sweeping towards Perfect Sword Immortal like a tsunami.</p>
<p>Although a lot of the invisible sword beams had been expended, the remaining invisible sword beams were still like a tidal wave. At that moment, they attacked Perfect Sword Immortal at 100% strength. Their might was in no way inferior to a meteorite bombardment.</p>
<p>Countless invisible sword beams rushed in front of Perfect Sword Immortal, but in the next second, something shocking happened.</p>
<p>A strange force field rose up from Perfect Sword Immortal’s body. In the force field, the invisible sword beams remained motionless as though they had frozen in midair.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1381'>Chapter 1381: True Sword Beam</h3>
<p>“Do you think you are worthy of using sword beams with that incomplete Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array?” Step by step, Perfect Sword Immortal walked towards Zhou Wen. As he moved, the invisible sword beams began moving again.</p>
<p>However, this time, the invisible sword beams didn’t charge at Perfect Sword Immortal. Instead, their tips spun around and aimed at Zhou Wen. The sword beams that filled the sky surrounded him.</p>
<p>Calamity-grade! Zhou Wen was alarmed. Without any hesitation, he used Singularity Universe’s interstellar teleportation ability, hoping to leave this place first.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was surprised to discover that the connection between Singularity Universe and the stars seemed to be blocked. He couldn’t sense the location of the stars at all, so he naturally couldn’t teleport out.</p>
<p>“Ignoring you, even if Starlady Polestar were to come personally, she wouldn’t be able to escape my Perfect Sword Immortal Domain,” Perfect Sword Immortal said coldly as he saw through Zhou Wen’s intentions.</p>
<p>Calamity-grade? Zhou Wen didn’t have the luxury of time to think because the invisible sword beams had already descended.</p>
<p>Although the invisible sword beams were condensed by Zhou Wen himself, he had spent a lot of time condensing them one by one.</p>
<p>Now that they had descended together, other Terror-grade creatures couldn’t withstand them, and neither could Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that the Heavenly Robe on him no longer had a 100% dodge rate, even if it could, there was no space to dodge amidst such dense invisible sword beams.</p>
<p>The so-called 100% dodge rate required space to dodge. It wasn’t something that allowed him to dodge any attack.</p>
<p>Many thoughts flashed through his mind as he immediately made a decision. At this moment, if he didn’t immediately make a decision, death was certain.</p>
<p>At the instant the sword beams landed on him, Zhou Wen’s figure suddenly vanished into thin air. He didn’t retreat. Instead, he instant transmitted to the back of Perfect Sword Immortal and pulled out his Bamboo Blade to stab at his back.</p>
<p>After falling into the Calamity-grade Zone, if he couldn’t use interstellar teleportation to escape, the chances of him escaping were almost zero. It wasn’t that he could go from a passive position to an active position. If he could catch his opponent by surprise and have him reveal a flaw, Zhou Wen could take the opportunity to use Singularity Universe’s teleportation to leave during a lapse in the Calamity Zone.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Without looking back, the Perfect Sword Immortal flicked his finger, flicking Bamboo Blade’s blade and causing it to bend. The tip of the blade almost ended up stabbing Zhou Wen’s arm.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt as though his palm couldn’t grip the hilt of the saber any longer. The force was surprisingly powerful, completely exceeding the power of a Terror-grade entity.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen’s arm was about to be snapped by the force, Zhou Wen suddenly flung his arm and went along with the force to spin his arm and body. His body spun like a drill as the Bamboo Blade stabbed at Perfect Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Perfect Sword Immortal flicked the tip of the blade with his finger again, causing Zhou Wen’s saber to tremble as his bones seemed to shake loose.</p>
<p>If not for Zhou Wen’s understanding of strength and sword art exceeding this level, he probably wouldn’t have been able to withstand the two simple finger flicks.</p>
<p>Gritting his teeth, Zhou Wen spun like a spinning top and used the momentum to move the saber out. His figure appeared by the side of Perfect Sword Immortal and slashed at his neck.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s spinning figure was like a ghost as he pushed the Heart Defying Sword Art to its limits. He appeared everywhere around Perfect Sword Immortal, and his sword moves were even stranger and unpredictable. However, every strike was easily repelled by Perfect Sword Immortal’s casual flick. Not a single strike could touch him.</p>
<p>“Your sword art isn’t bad. You have the right for such pride on Earth. Unfortunately, as my enemy, you are far inferior.” Perfect Sword Immortal flicked the Bamboo Blade again. However, this time, a firefly-like light lit up at his fingertip.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>When his fingertip collided with the blade, a light wave rapidly spread out like water ripples.</p>
<p>After the wave of light, the Bamboo Blade that had been with Zhou Wen for a long time instantly shattered. Zhou Wen’s body flew backward like a cannonball. After slamming into the ground, he left a ravine hundreds of meters long.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen spat out a mouthful of blood. Due to the high-speed friction, the Heavenly Robe produced smoke due to the extremely high temperature.</p>
<p>“Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, Lucky Dodge—those are just external forces akin to tricks. It might be a little useful against trash, but it’s useless against me.” Perfect Sword Immortal wasn’t in a rush to immediately finish him off. As he spoke, the invisible sword beams that Zhou Wen condensed were controlled by him again as they swept out like a tidal wave.</p>
<p>However, his words embarrassed Cave Era and company. Their expressions didn’t look good.</p>
<p>If it was still a little useful against trash, wouldn’t they be inferior to trash if they were nearly killed by Zhou Wen?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen endured the pain from his injuries and leaped up from the ground. However, the sword beams that filled the sky had already arrived, giving him no chance to dodge.</p>
<p>He used instant transmission again, but this time, when he appeared, Perfect Sword Immortal seemed to have determined his landing spot. Countless sword beams were already there. At the instant Zhou Wen phased into existence, several invisible sword beams stabbed into his body, immediately dyeing the Heavenly Robe red with blood.</p>
<p>Even more invisible sword beams were already inches away as they tore towards him from all directions.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen summoned the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Instantly, the Chaos Egg was stabbed like a reverse hedgehog. Invisible sword beams constantly stabbed at it as they collided with each other.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Chaos Egg’s defense was good. The Chaos Egg, which could even withstand temporal and spatial powers, managed to withstand the terrifying sword stream’s impact.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t! Why isn’t Sweetie doing a thing at this point in time? Don’t tell me she’s going to watch me die? Zhou Wen crushed the invisible sword aura that had stabbed him and swallowed a Mythical Dragon Resurrection Pill Essence. His injuries immediately healed at a discernible pace. In a moment, his damaged organs recovered and his external injuries were almost healed.</p>
<p>“You aren’t dead yet?” After all the invisible sword beams struck the Chaos Egg and exploded, Perfect Sword Immortal couldn’t help but be surprised that the strange ball hadn’t been pierced through.</p>
<p>However, his surprise only lasted for a moment. To Perfect Sword Immortal, the invisible sword beams that Zhou Wen condensed were still too weak. They just had the numbers.</p>
<p>From the point of view of a Terror grade, so many invisible sword beams were terrifying, but they were nothing to Perfect Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>“Since you aren’t dead, I’ll let you see what a true sword beam is,” said Perfect Sword Immortal as he raised his index and middle fingers together and stabbed at the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>A purple sword beam took form at his fingertip. Like a purple beam of light, it shot at the Chaos Egg and instantly struck it.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg was forced back by the purple sword beam. After slamming into the ground, the purple sword beam continued its onslaught, slamming the Chaos Egg deep into the ground.</p>
<p>The shockwave produced by the sword beam blasted open the ground spanning thousands of meters. Cave Era and the other Guardians had no choice but to quickly retreat.</p>
<p>After the terrifying purple sword beam completely dissipated, a huge crater thousands of meters in diameter appeared in the ground. Even Cave Era and company felt their hearts tremble when they saw it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1382'>Chapter 1382: Battling Perfect Sword Immortal</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Chaos Egg had been put to the test. It didn’t explode back when it was used as a ping pong ball between Calamity-grade existences.</p>
<p>However, the sword beam from Perfect Sword Immortal was truly indomitable. The might of the strike caused many solid Essence Energy Crystals to form in the Chaos Egg, but it failed to shatter it.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the deep pit, Zhou Wen unsummoned the Chaos Egg and summoned the Earth Elemental Beast. He wanted to use its Earth Escape powers to escape.</p>
<p>However, the Earth Elemental Beast didn’t escape far before it suddenly let out a tragic cry. Its body seemed to have been penetrated by invisible swords.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed as he immediately knew that it wasn’t safe underground. He was still in the Calamity Zone, so the Earth Elemental Beast probably couldn’t escape.</p>
<p>However, this allowed Zhou Wen to roughly determine the range of Perfect Sword Immortal’s domain and gain some confidence.</p>
<p>Since the Earth Elemental Beast was about to die, Zhou Wen could only order it to escape from the soil before immediately unsummoning it.</p>
<p>Even so, he failed to keep the Earth Elemental Beast alive. The pattern on Zhou Wen’s body gradually faded before disappearing. Zhou Wen couldn’t sense its existence.</p>
<p>F*ck you! Zhou Wen gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>Perfect Sword Immortal took a step forward and appeared above Zhou Wen. He looked down at him and said, “You actually survived. You really surprised me.”</p>
<p>“I’ll outlive you.” Zhou Wen instant transmitted to the back of Perfect Sword Immortal and swung his arm in a slash.</p>
<p>However, just as he raised his arm, Perfect Sword Immortal turned around and kicked him in the abdomen like a phantom, sending him flying.</p>
<p>“Cough!” Zhou Wen spat out a mouthful of blood. The kick had severely injured him, nearly causing his stomach to explode. As it was so fast, Zhou Wen failed to react in time.</p>
<p>Like a flash, Perfect Sword Immortal was unbelievably fast. He came in front of Zhou Wen and grabbed his head with his palm before squeezing it.</p>
<p>The scene in Perfect Sword Immortal’s mind of his head exploding didn’t happen. His fingers ended up sinking into white rubber-like matter.</p>
<p>The fingers that were originally holding Zhou Wen were now holding the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Perfect Sword Immortal squeezed again, hoping to crush the Chaos Egg. However, he was somewhat surprised to discover that the Chaos Egg was soft and pliable. He failed to crack it and only managed to distort it greatly.</p>
<p>“I want to see how strong this ball’s defense is.” Perfect Sword Immortal exerted strength in his palm and lifted the Chaos Egg before throwing it into the air.</p>
<p>At the instant it was thrown into the air, a purple lotus flower bloomed in Perfect Sword Immortal’s hand.</p>
<p>If one looked carefully, they would realize that it wasn’t a lotus flower, but purple sword beams.</p>
<p>The lotus flower-like purple sword beams stabbed at the Chaos Egg. Sword beams struck the Chaos Egg from different directions. As the sword beams came from different directions, the impact kept the Chaos Egg suspended in midair. The sword beams struck it one after another as it remained stuck in place.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>After being repeatedly struck by several sword beams, the Chaos Egg’s form was distorted beyond recognition. It was very worrying that it would explode at any moment.</p>
<p>However, no matter how distorted the Chaos Egg was, there were a few times when it was like a balloon that had been pricked by a needle. It seemed to explode, but it ultimately didn’t.</p>
<p>Cave Era and company were alarmed. In the past, Zhou Wen had relied on his Lucky Dodge to dodge the Calamity-grade bullets and help others enter the rankings. They felt that Zhou Wen was lucky to have such a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Yet, Zhou Wen was now withstanding a barrage of Calamity-grade attacks with his own strength. This wasn’t as simple as luck.</p>
<p>Cave Era and company asked themselves. If it were them, would they have died on the spot from the sword beams?</p>
<p>Back when the metal flower fought Yana, Zhou Wen had also used the Chaos Egg. The shockwaves from the battle between the two Calamity-grade creatures were too intense, so the satellites failed to capture the Chaos Egg on the battlefield. Therefore, this was the first time Cave Era and company had seen the powerful defense of Chaos.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t having it easy either. The sword beams of Perfect Sword Immortal were just too powerful. Sword beams struck the Chaos Egg, making it condense a large number of solid Essence Energy Crystals.</p>
<p>If this continued, Zhou Wen would be buried alive by the solid Essence Energy crystals.</p>
<p>No, I can’t have this continue. I have to think of a solution. Zhou Wen’s mind kept racing, but the solutions he could think of when facing a Calamity-grade creature seemed very limited.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that he didn’t have anything that could fight a Calamity-grade. Truth Listener and Immortal Culling Sword had the power to fight a Calamity-grade.</p>
<p>The problem was that he couldn’t summon Truth Listener. Using the Immortal Culling Sword required a large amount of Essence Energy to support it. Every use made Zhou Wen lose his combat strength.</p>
<p>As for the strength of Perfect Sword Immortal, it was clearly not a problem that could be resolved with one strike.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen had some concerns that prevented him from using the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>Previously, Perfect Sword Immortal had been able to control his invisible sword beams. Clearly, the other party was very proficient in sword-type powers. If the Immortal Culling Sword was controlled by the other party when he used it, Zhou Wen wouldn’t even have the time to cry.</p>
<p>What should I do? What should I do? Where did Sweetie go? Is she really going to watch me die? Zhou Wen was at his wits’ end as he thought of Sweetie.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found it odd. Logically speaking, Sweetie shouldn’t allow him to die before figuring out the true situation of the candy box. However, Sweetie hadn’t taken action up to now as though she had no intention of saving him.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t know what was happening, Zhou Wen knew very well that he couldn’t count on her.</p>
<p>At that moment, Sweetie was in the sky with an anxious expression. She was indeed very powerful, and wasn’t really restricted while on Earth. However, there were some rules that she had to abide by. She was in a dilemma as to whether she should break the rules to save Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>If the rules were broken, the effect on Earth would be unimaginable.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know this, but he was somewhat glad. He was glad that he had discovered that Sweetie wouldn’t help him. If he really went to Chess Mountain and realized that Sweetie didn’t care about his survival, it would be troublesome.</p>
<p>Although Perfect Sword Immortal was terrifying, Zhou Wen didn’t find him as terrifying as The Thearch.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen had seen a few Calamity-grade existences at the level of Perfect Sword Immortal. For example, Tsukuyomi, Drought Demon Fairy, Ant City’s Guardian, and so on. They didn’t feel any weaker than Perfect Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>The difference was that Tsukuyomi hadn’t fought Zhou Wen seriously. Drought Demon had held back for some reason. This made them appear less strong than Perfect Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>As for the Ant City Guardian, Zhou Wen had never defeated her before. Zhou Wen didn’t know how strong she was or how strong she would become in the future.</p>
<p>Quick, think of a solution… I have to think of a solution… Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to let his imagination run wild. There were too many solid Essence Energy crystals and they were about to fill the Chaos Egg. If this continued, the Chaos Egg would probably explode.</p>
<p>It’s… It’s useless even if I absorb them… Even if my entire body is filled with a sea of energy, how much can I absorb… I’m afraid I’ll die from excessive eating before the Chaos Egg cracks… Hold on… Speaking of eating… I seem to have a glutton here… Zhou Wen’s eyes suddenly lit up as he thought of Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1383'>Chapter 1383: Fight to the Death</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>There was a very difficult technical problem for Tyrant Behemoth to devour the solid Essence Energy crystals in the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had recognized this problem the last time the Chaos Egg was about to explode, but he ultimately chose to use the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>This was because the Chaos Egg was only effective against Zhou Wen. Furthermore, the space was extremely small. Even as Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast, it was impossible for it to enter the Chaos Egg and directly devour the solid crystals inside.</p>
<p>In the past, Zhou Wen had always absorbed the Essence Energy in the Chaos Egg before transferring it to his Companion Beasts. This problem had never been resolved.</p>
<p>However, things were somewhat different now. Although he hadn’t succeeded with his research on the infinite spatial circulation skill, the parts regarding spatial swapping and teleportation could resolve the current problem.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only needed to leave a spatial mark in Tyrant Behemoth’s mouth. Even if he didn’t summon it, he could constantly send solid Essence Energy crystals into its mouth.</p>
<p>The only problem was that Zhou Wen still needed to summon Tyrant Behemoth first before leaving a spatial mark in its mouth. Then, he could constantly teleport solid Essence Energy crystals in.</p>
<p>Of course, this spatial mark couldn’t be exchanged with Tyrant Behemoth’s body. Thankfully, Zhou Wen’s research results had resolved this problem.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could use the mark as the item of exchange instead of the marked item.</p>
<p>The sword beams outside shot out one after another. To unsummon the Chaos Egg and summon Tyrant Behemoth at such a time was clearly not an easy task. He had to do so under the risk of dying.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen still knew Spacetime Bandit. He could use it to cast the skill before unsummoning the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>If he did it in tandem, he might be able to complete a series of actions at the same time and summon the Chaos Egg out again. This way, he would just be exposed for a short period of time and the risk would be minimized.</p>
<p>Of course, this was only a theory. Whether it could be done perfectly was still a question.</p>
<p>I can only take a gamble. Zhou Wen wasn’t too confident, but the solid crystals in the Chaos Egg were about to fill up. He had to take a gamble.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the lotus flower sword beams released by Perfect Sword Immortal were almost depleted. Zhou Wen planned on using the moment when the lotus flower sword beams were expended and before Perfect Sword Immortal released a new skill to carry out his risky operations.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen could only silently pray that Perfect Sword Immortal didn’t immediately cast other skills. Otherwise, he could only take the blow head-on.</p>
<p>Perfect Sword Immortal didn’t do anything new. He kept looking at the Chaos Egg. The lotus flower sword beams he released were probably something even ordinary Calamity-grade entities could hardly withstand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, who was at the Terror grade, was actually able to last for so long. Although he was using pure defensive powers, it was already extremely shocking. It made him increasingly feel that he had to strengthen Jiang Yan. Jiang Yan’s opponents were really powerful.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen silently waited for the last sword beam to strike the Chaos Egg as his heart involuntarily pounded.</p>
<p>There was nervousness and excitement. This extreme challenge in the face of danger made his numbed nerves abnormally active.</p>
<p>How fast is a Calamity-grade creature’s reaction speed? 100 milliseconds? 10 milliseconds or 1 millisecond? Zhou Wen didn’t know how fast Perfect Sword Immortal’s reaction was. Perhaps after he came out, he wouldn’t have the time to use any skills before he was blasted to death by a sword beam from Perfect Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen needed to consider everything and try his best to push each operation to the limit.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The final sword beam struck the Chaos Egg, causing it to distort and shake. It was like a balloon that was filled with water that was being struck by a fist.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Chaos Egg ultimately survived and wasn’t blasted apart by the sword beam.</p>
<p>Perfect Sword Immortal frowned slightly. Just as he was about to use a stronger attack to blast the Chaos Egg apart, he suddenly saw the Chaos Egg vanish at the moment the sword beam vanished.</p>
<p>When Perfect Sword Immortal saw Zhou Wen’s figure appear, he prepared to attack and eliminate him.</p>
<p>As Jiang Yan was relatively weak and was only at the Epic stage, he couldn’t withstand his possession for long. Therefore, he had to end the battle quickly. Otherwise, even if he won, Jiang Yan’s body would be crippled.</p>
<p>However, before Perfect Sword Immortal could take action, he heard Zhou Wen’s voice almost at the same time the Chaos Egg vanished. Zhou Wen had shouted with a roar: “Come out. Earth’s strongest Companion Beast.”</p>
<p>Perfect Sword Immortal wasn’t interested in what Zhou Wen had to say. All he wanted to do was kill Zhou Wen immediately, but when he heard Zhou Wen shout out the words “Earth’s strongest Companion Beast,” he subconsciously paused.</p>
<p>He naturally knew that it was impossible for Zhou Wen to have the strongest Companion Beast on Earth, but the entire dimension wanted Earth’s strongest Companion Beast. This name made him subconsciously want to see what Companion Beast Zhou Wen had summoned.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth was summoned by Zhou Wen. Its strong body landed on the ground, causing an earthquake.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was overjoyed when he saw that Perfect Sword Immortal hadn’t immediately attacked. He immediately used Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping to inject the mark into Tyrant Behemoth’s mouth.</p>
<p>When Perfect Sword Immortal saw Zhou Wen’s actions, he immediately realized that something was amiss. He instantly condensed a sword beam and shot it out. The sword beam flashed and vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth back almost at the same time and used the Chaos Egg again.</p>
<p>Even so, he was still a step too slow. The sword beam from Perfect Sword Immortal stabbed into Zhou Wen’s heart before the Chaos Egg appeared.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg enveloped Zhou Wen’s body, but his chest was penetrated by the sword beam. The sword beam looked like a purple ancient sword as Zhou Wen seemed to be wrapped in lightning.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart was pierced, but he didn’t feel any pain.</p>
<p>Ah! Suddenly, Zhou Wen felt an electric current flow out of the sword beam, causing his entire body to twitch as though he was having a fit.</p>
<p>To be fooled by Zhou Wen made Perfect Sword Immortal’s expression turn cold. He stared at the Chaos Egg and said coldly, “The sword beam you are struck with is the Heavenly Tribulation Sword. Although it won’t kill you immediately, it will release nine Heavenly Tribulation lightning bolts. The first bolt will destroy your body; the second bolt will slice through your bones; the third bolt will kill you, and the fourth bolt will destroy your soul… Even an Apocalypse-grade expert can’t withstand the pain of the nine Heavenly Tribulations. If you come out now, you can die a quick death. If you continue hiding, you will probably wish you were dead…”</p>
<p>“At the very least, I’m not dead,” Zhou Wen said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>He had done his best, but had still been injured by Perfect Sword Immortal. This was a difference in strength that was out of Zhou Wen’s control.</p>
<p>Thankfully, as Perfect Sword Immortal hadn’t attacked immediately, he didn’t have the time to release his other skills. He only used the fastest Heavenly Tribulation Sword, or Zhou Wen would have already been dead.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Zhou Wen had managed to win himself a chance for survival.. Just as he said, he wasn’t dead yet.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1384'>Chapter 1384: Nine Swords of Heavenly Tribulation</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen’s forehead was covered in cold sweat as his face contorted in pain.</p>
<p>The lightning that surged out of the Heavenly Tribulation Sword wasn’t ordinary lightning. If it were ordinary lightning, it would at most electrocute a person to death. However, this lightning seemed to be able to penetrate deep into his cells, making Zhou Wen feel as though every cell in his body was being stabbed by needles. The pain that seeped into his soul was indescribable.</p>
<p>The claim that the first bolt would destroy his body wasn’t the destruction of a body in the traditional sense. Instead, it meant that the pain one suffered would make one embark on a path of self-destruction.</p>
<p>Ordinary people would probably commit suicide if they were struck by the first bolt.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t commit suicide. His body trembled as he gritted his teeth. However, as he continued circulating the Chaos Egg, he circulated the Human Sovereign Sutra and continued using Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping to transmit a portion of the solid crystals in the Chaos Egg to Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Perfect Sword Immortal could hear Zhou Wen’s tragic cries in the beginning, but he stopped hearing them after some time. He couldn’t help but frown slightly.</p>
<p>“To be able to withstand the pain of the Heavenly Tribulation without screaming, you do have some backbone.” Perfect Sword Immortal believed that Zhou Wen was doomed. Even a Terror-grade creature with great perseverance could at most hold through the first three tribulations. The fourth tribulation spelled almost certain death.</p>
<p>Taking ten thousand steps back, even if Zhou Wen was lucky enough to survive the fourth tribulation, there were still the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth tribulations ahead. Each tribulation was more terrifying than the last. It was definitely not something humans could withstand.</p>
<p>However, every tribulation lasted for a period of time. Since Perfect Sword Immortal had possessed Jiang Yan’s body, he naturally couldn’t wait that long.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Perfect Sword Immortal condensed another sword beam. It streaked across the sky like a white beam as it charged at the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg was drowned by the sword beam as though it had melted into it.</p>
<p>The column-like sword beam continued without end. As for the Chaos Egg amid the sword beam, it was being penetrated from every angle.</p>
<p>From Perfect Sword Immortal’s point of view, Zhou Wen was suffering the ravages of the Heavenly Tribulation Sword, so he definitely couldn’t put his all into withstanding the sword beam. Furthermore, the sword beam had a very powerful penetrative ability. Even a defensive skill at the Calamity grade couldn’t withstand it for long.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg around Zhou Wen would definitely be pierced quickly. When that happened, Zhou Wen would die.</p>
<p>However, under the continuous impact of the sword beam, the Chaos Egg remained intact despite being distorted.</p>
<p>Inside the Chaos Egg, Zhou Wen endured the pain brought by the Heavenly Tribulation and constantly sent solid Essence Energy crystals to Tyrant Behemoth. A large number of solid Essence Energy crystals were devoured by Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Of course, there were two preconditions. Firstly, Tyrant Behemoth was Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast. It was equivalent to a part of Zhou Wen’s body, so it could devour the solid Essence Energy crystals condensed from the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Secondly, although Tyrant Behemoth was in its tattoo form, it was still inside the Chaos Egg. If these two conditions couldn’t be satisfied, even if Zhou Wen had the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping technique, he couldn’t move the solid Essence Energy Crystal out.</p>
<p>Perfect Sword Immortal’s attack made large amounts of solid Essence Energy condense. Its speed was several times faster than before.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen hadn’t teleported a large number of solid Essence Energy crystals to Tyrant Behemoth, the Chaos Egg would have long exploded.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was still very worried. This was because after Tyrant Behemoth devoured a large number of solid Essence Energy crystals, the tattoo began to glow and burn like a red-hot brand.</p>
<p>Hold on! Zhou Wen could only hold on. If he were to leave the Chaos Egg, death was almost certain.</p>
<p>However, Tyrant Behemoth was only at the Mythical stage after all. It hadn’t reached the legendary realm of eating a thousand mountains daily. And the solid Essence Energy crystals it ate were not as simple as one or two mountains in terms of energy.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was worried that Tyrant Behemoth would explode, the Tyrant Behemoth tattoo began to change.</p>
<p>This fellow… is evolving while eating? Zhou Wen was surprised and delighted to discover that Tyrant Behemoth had begun evolving. Furthermore, it was directly evolving. It didn’t have the inoculation process that ordinary Companion Beasts needed when evolving.</p>
<p>As expected of Glutton Behemoth. It evolves as it eats. Awesome! Zhou Wen was delighted as he teleported more solid crystals over.</p>
<p>He had no choice. Perfect Sword Immortal’s offensive strength was just too potent. If he didn’t teleport the solid Essence Energy crystals out as quickly as possible, the Chaos Egg would explode at any moment.</p>
<p>Even with the constant teleportation, the Essence Energy crystals in the Chaos Egg remained in a state that occupied most of the space.</p>
<p>This was because the energy of Essence Energy crystals was so high-level and pure. Tyrant Behemoth—which was only at the Mythical stage—completed its evolution because of the high purity and high-level Essence Energy.</p>
<p>The Tyrant Behemoth tattoo was a little indiscernible now. It used to be black, but now, it was the color of a black hole that absorbed all light. One’s gaze was sucked in upon landing on it, making it impossible to see what the Tyrant Behemoth tattoo looked like.</p>
<p>After completing its evolution, Tyrant Behemoth’s devouring capability increased greatly. The solid Essence Energy crystals that Zhou Wen teleported over couldn’t make Tyrant Behemoth glow like before.</p>
<p>This change made Zhou Wen, who was enduring the pain of the Heavenly Tribulation, feel much better.</p>
<p>Although the Heavenly Tribulation lightning made him suffer, Zhou Wen’s willpower was just too tenacious. Such pain couldn’t make him waver.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out to pull the Heavenly Tribulation Sword out of his chest, but when his palm touched it, it passed through it as though it didn’t exist.</p>
<p>Instead, when his palm passed through the Heavenly Tribulation Sword, the pain intensified several times.</p>
<p>What the hell is this? Zhou Wen circulated several powers but failed to produce any alleviating effects. He could only rely on his willpower to resist it.</p>
<p>Three minutes later, the pain of the lightning piercing through his body suddenly vanished. It receded like the tide.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could take a deep breath, lightning suddenly surged out of the Heavenly Tribulation Sword. However, this time, it was different from before. The lightning didn’t cause Zhou Wen any pain. It didn’t even hurt.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, Zhou Wen felt something worse than pain.</p>
<p>Itchiness!</p>
<p>The bone-chilling itch felt as though thousands of ants were crawling under his skin. It made Zhou Wen’s body tremble.</p>
<p>Sometimes, pain could be endured, but not itchiness.</p>
<p>The Perfect Sword Immortal outside was no longer just surprised. His Destruction Sword Flash, which had the strongest destructive power, still failed to shatter the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>It’s already time for the second Heavenly Tribulation. The present him shouldn’t be able to focus.. It will be difficult for him to resist the Major Destruction Sword Flash, right? Perfect Sword Immortal thought.</p>

<h3 id='chapter1385'>Chapter 1385: Slaying the Human Heart</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Uesugi Nao stood at the top of a mountain and watched the battle from afar with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>She had contracted Great Skyfiend to obtain strength. Indeed, she had obtained extremely powerful strength in a short period of time.</p>
<p>For a while, Uesugi Nao even believed that her actions would become mainstream and she, a pioneer of humanity’s future.</p>
<p>However, things didn’t seem to develop in the direction she had expected. Although there were indeed many humans who chose to contract with Guardians and become contractors, Guardians didn’t become humanity’s mainstream. The Holy Spirit Association advanced with Spirit Casting and Hui Haifeng produced Mythical Serum. There were also humans like Human Sovereign and Deceit King who had advanced to the Mythical stage using some unknown method.</p>
<p>As no one had seen the true faces of Human Sovereign and Deceit King, it was impossible to determine if they had used methods like Spirit Casting or the Mythical Serum. All they knew was that they hadn’t contracted Guardians.</p>
<p>However, the Zhou Wen in front of her most likely didn’t use anything like a Mythical Serum. This was because he didn’t have any characteristics of a dimensional creature, nor could any auras other than a human’s could be sensed.</p>
<p>A human can actually reach such a level and even fight a Calamity-grade powerhouse. This dealt a huge blow to Uesugi Nao’s heart.</p>
<p>Can the strength of humans really be that strong? Uesugi Nao’s firm beliefs wavered slightly.</p>
<p>Although she was a very opinionated person and had always done as she wished, Zhou Wen’s performance made Uesugi Nao, who was determined, begin to doubt herself.</p>
<p>Even if the four Heavenly Kings attacked together, they probably wouldn’t last a minute against such a powerful Calamity-grade power. Yet, Zhou Wen had managed to last until now without being completely defeated.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t doing well though. Although the bone-chilling itch didn’t affect him much, it was still troublesome.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s focus was unparalleled. If it was just an itch, it wouldn’t affect him as long as he didn’t think about it.</p>
<p>He was only afraid that the Calamity-grade power wasn’t that simple. If the subsequent Heavenly Tribulations attacked his body, Zhou Wen’s body wouldn’t be able to withstand the impact of the Calamity-grade power and would be instantly killed.</p>
<p>In a battle with a Calamity-grade, I can only summon Truth Listener or use the Immortal Culling Sword. Otherwise, there’s no chance of victory. I don’t even stand a chance at fighting. There might still be a chance if I advance to the Terror grade… Zhou Wen thought of Slaughterer.</p>
<p>Slaughterer could only advance by making the opponent feel fear, but he was the one being suppressed. The opponent held the absolute advantage. It was impossible to even injure the opponent, much less make him feel fear.</p>
<p>Three minutes quickly passed, but Zhou Wen still failed to think of a solution. As for the Heavenly Tribulation, it changed again. This time, Zhou Wen no longer felt itchy, but something even more terrifying happened to him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen instantly felt that his various senses were being magnified countless times. They were even sharper than when he used Great Brahma.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but cry out. Pain, numbness, soreness, and itchiness surged at him under the stimulation of the lightning.</p>
<p>This stimulation was something Zhou Wen could tolerate. He usually wouldn’t even grunt. However, as his perception had been magnified, he became extremely sensitive. The pain was also magnified several times.</p>
<p>This stimulation had already reached the limits of human endurance when it came to pain, but once Zhou Wen focused on other things, the pain in his body weakened.</p>
<p>It couldn’t be said to be weakened. It could only be said that he didn’t feel the pain because of his distraction.</p>
<p>How can I advance Slaughterer to the Terror grade? What should I do? Although Zhou Wen knew that it was difficult, this was the most viable opportunity for him to save himself.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen was thinking about how to advance Slaughterer. The pain he felt became weaker and weaker.</p>
<p>Three minutes was neither short nor long. The third Heavenly Tribulation passed.</p>
<p>In these three minutes, Tyrant Behemoth began glowing and heating up again because it had swallowed too many Essence Energy crystals. Thankfully, it wasn’t as hot as before. It probably wasn’t at its limit.</p>
<p>The fourth Heavenly Tribulation lightning surged out. This time, it wasn’t as simple as physical pain. It penetrated deep into his soul and affected Zhou Wen’s emotions.</p>
<p>Typically, the fourth Heavenly Tribulation would trigger illusions, allowing people to see what they were most afraid of. Many people would die at this stage.</p>
<p>This was because humans often didn’t lose to powerful enemies, but to themselves.</p>
<p>However, this tribulation was easier for Zhou Wen to deal with than the previous ones. As his mind was so focused, the Heavenly Tribulation lightning couldn’t affect his brain or make him hallucinate.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept thinking about how to advance Slaughterer without realizing the fourth Heavenly Tribulation. As time ticked by, Zhou Wen still failed to come up with a solution after three minutes of the fourth Heavenly Tribulation.</p>
<p>However, at that moment, Zhou Wen felt a reaction from Slaughterer. Furthermore, the reaction was very intense.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Why would Slaughterer react at such a time? I’m clearly at an absolute disadvantage now. It’s impossible for me to cause fear to the enemy… Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised, but Slaughterer’s reaction couldn’t be faked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally didn’t know how shocking it was for Perfect Sword Immortal to see him survive the fourth Heavenly Tribulation.</p>
<p>This time, Slaughterer’s reaction was stronger than ever before. Zhou Wen could even sense that Slaughterer’s aura was burgeoning rapidly.</p>
<p>Why is this happening? Could it be that my enemy feels fear? But he’s clearly at an absolute advantage… Wait… Heart Slaying… Having an advantage doesn’t mean that he doesn’t feel fear… Zhou Wen recalled a story his grandfather had told him when he was young.</p>
<p>There was an ancient person who was very worried that the sky would collapse. Every time it rained on a cloudy day, he would try his best to run, afraid that the sky would collapse and kill him.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen thought of this story and connected it to the present situation and Slaughterer’s reaction, he suddenly seemed to understand something.</p>
<p>Humans might be afraid of known dangers, but as they came into contact with them, their fear would gradually decrease. Instead, they were extremely afraid of things that hadn’t happened or had no chance of making contact with.</p>
<p>For example, when one stood at the edge of a rooftop, even if they were tethered to a rope, their legs would still go limp despite knowing that they wouldn’t fall.</p>
<p>Or perhaps many people would be afraid that no one would care for them when they were old. No matter how bad their children were, they would be submissive towards them and not dare disobey them.</p>
<p>Heart Slaying… So that’s how it is… I seem to understand… The slaying of the human heart… lies in them doing it themselves… Zhou Wen gained new insights.. Many things that clouded him previously cleared up.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter1386'>Chapter 1386: Natural Enemy</h3>
<p>It was almost impossible to guess the weakness of a stranger.</p>
<p>Every human or creature’s weakness was different. Unless God personally came, it was impossible to know what anyone’s weakness was.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if Sweetie was really God, as God, even she couldn’t identify the weakness of one’s human nature, much less a mortal.</p>
<p>Although it was indeed effective to guess a person’s weakness in human nature based on their actions and reactions, it was impossible to have enough opportunities to observe and understand the opponent in a real battle.</p>
<p>Not every powerful enemy was like Shangguan Jinhong, a powerful adversary that ended up losing to his weaker opponent, Li Xunhuan[1].</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously wanted to interpret one’s weakness in human nature through observation. This path couldn’t be said to be wrong, but it was a very long path.</p>
<p>He now understood something. Perhaps he didn’t need much observation to obtain the desired outcome. All he needed to do was go from a microscopic view to a macroscopic view.</p>
<p>For example, rats were afraid of cats. Some plants liked water, while others were afraid of water. Some metals were easily oxidized, while others were difficult to oxidize.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t need to understand what a person or creature was afraid of. All he needed to do was grasp what restrained them thanks to nature, making it much easier.</p>
<p>This should be called a natural enemy, right? As his insights deepened, Zhou Wen realized that Slaughterer’s reaction was even more intense. It was unknown if it was because the enemy outside had produced fear that affected Slaughterer or if it was the result of his own epiphany.</p>
<p>Slaughterer constantly released Essence Energy. Zhou Wen felt his body being transformed by a strange force as his flesh and blood gradually changed.</p>
<p>Although it was still a body of flesh and blood, the modified parts seemed to have been given a new characteristic.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t tell what kind of characteristic it was. His body was still the same, and his appearance hadn’t changed, but there was another qualitative change. It was magical and strange.</p>
<p>Slaughterer had fused with Zhou Wen’s body. Zhou Wen could clearly sense that his transformation was happening at the same time as him. The feeling was indescribable. If he had to describe it, it was like a twin that was telepathically connected.</p>
<p>In the past, Zhou Wen’s connection with Slaughterer wasn’t tight. In the beginning, he couldn’t even control Slaughterer because his personality was very different from Slaughterer’s. It could be said that they were antithesis to one another and incompatible.</p>
<p>Only today did Zhou Wen realize that he was truly one with Slaughterer—you are me and I am you. There was no distinction between them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only reached the level that ordinary humans could reach today.</p>
<p>The reason it was so difficult for Zhou Wen to advance to the Terror grade was not only because the Lost Immortal Sutra was difficult to advance, but also because of the conflict between Slaughterer and his personality.</p>
<p>However, at that moment, the two finally found a balance, or rather, a hub that connected them together. Slaughterer finally completely opened itself to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t like killing, but Slaughterer was born from killing. Zhou Wen shouldn’t have condensed such a Life Soul, but did so because of the influence of the Lost Immortal Sutra and the Lost Immortal Sutra’s owner.</p>
<p>The two constantly fused and adapted to each other until this opportunity appeared. Finally, there was no gap between them.</p>
<p>Perfect Sword Immortal was extremely surprised. For a mere human to withstand five Heavenly Tribulations without collapsing was unimaginable.</p>
<p>Although Perfect Sword Immortal had exaggerated the claim that the Nine Tribulations could destroy Apocalypse-grade powerhouses, very few Calamity-grade creatures could withstand the Heavenly Tribulation Sword.</p>
<p>I have to eliminate this fellow. Otherwise, it will definitely be a calamity for our race. A cold glint flashed in the eyes of Perfect Sword Immortal as killing intent subconsciously appeared.</p>
<p>Previously, Perfect Sword Immortal had some qualms and didn’t wish to damage Jiang Yan’s body too much. However, now that he realized how terrifying Zhou Wen was, he immediately made a decision.</p>
<p>I can still find another representative, but I definitely can’t have this Zhou Wen stay alive. Sword aura rose from Perfect Sword Immortal’s body as sword beams surged from his hair and skin. His clothes and long hair fluttered. The Skyimmortal armor that had advanced to the Calamity grade constantly emitted sword beams as terrifying sword intent surged out.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency… Don’t continue… Immortal’s body can’t hold on much longer…” Cave Era kept paying attention to Jiang Yan. She was Jiang Yan’s sister and knew how dangerous it was to be possessed by dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Now, she realized that Immortal’s body had already shown signs of producing Essence Energy Crystals. This meant that Jiang Yan’s body couldn’t hold on any longer. If this continued, his body would completely crystallize. Even if he killed Zhou Wen, Jiang Yan would die.</p>
<p>However, Perfect Sword Immortal ignored her. Now, Perfect Sword Immortal only wanted Zhou Wen, a thorn in his side, dead. Everything else was secondary.</p>
<p>Seeing the sword intent and sword beam over Perfect Sword Immortal rapidly strengthen, Cave Era’s heart turned cold.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao and Blood Shaman wore mixed expressions. Anyone could tell that Perfect Sword Immortal was sacrificing Immortal. If Immortal could be sacrificed, what about them?</p>
<p>Cave Era instantly made a decision. Temporal power rapidly condensed over her body as time seemed to freeze.</p>
<p>“Cave Era, what are you trying to do?” Uesugi Nao and Blood Shaman looked at Cave Era in surprise.</p>
<p>“Immortal can’t die. You can stop me, but today’s Immortal might be you tomorrow,” said Cave Era.</p>
<p>Blood Shaman exchanged looks with Uesugi Nao. Blood Shaman said, “Even if we don’t stop you, will your Guardian help you?”</p>
<p>Blood Shaman spoke gloomily. Guardians were created by the dimension after all. Would they become enemies with dimensional powerhouses for humanity?</p>
<p>After all, a Guardian contract was an equal contract. Guardians could terminate the contract unilaterally at any time.</p>
<p>Cave Era extended her palm and looked at her Guardian armor as she muttered to herself, “Are you… still willing to follow me… This trip might result in death… If you aren’t willing, leave…”</p>
<p>“Why… fight… when… you… know… you’ll… die…” A voice that sounded ancient sounded from Cave Era.</p>
<p>“Because living like this will be more painful than death,” Cave Era answered.</p>
<p>After a second of silence, it wasn’t just Cave Era. Uesugi Nao and Blood Shaman also held their breaths nervously as they stared at the Guardian armor on Cave Era.</p>
<p>The voice that seemed to come from the ashes of history sounded again. “Instead of eternal life in infinite time, why don’t you turn eternal for a limited time? Since you want to fight, as you wish… Time… is infinite…”</p>
<p>The sound seemed to break through the sealed door of history. The entire armor began to emit temporal powers, instantly pushing them to their limits. Everything around them seemed to freeze as they went into super slow motion.</p>
<p>[1] Characters from The Little Li Flying Dagger, novel by Gulong.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1387'>Chapter 1387: The Traitorous Cave Era</h3>
<p>“Thank you!” Cave Era felt the power of Infinite Time erupt from her body. Although she couldn’t reach Infinite Time in the true sense of the word due to her level and make time truly stop, such power was already the limit of the Terror grade. In some aspects, she had even broken through the limits of the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Cave Era knew that this was the power produced by the Guardian consuming her body. It wouldn’t last long. She could only do something—no matter how negligible—during this period of time.</p>
<p>Attack Perfect Sword Immortal? Of course not. Cave Era knew very well that her strength was far inferior. Even if the Guardian consumed her body for power, it wouldn’t be enough to leave Perfect Sword Immortal flinching.</p>
<p>“Therefore…” Cave Era’s eyes flashed as she ran towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Under the influence of Infinite Time, time in the surroundings seemed to come to a standstill. Even the Calamity-grade sword beam didn’t appear fast. At the very least, Cave Era could keep up with the speed of the Calamity-grade sword beam.</p>
<p>Cave Era’s figure shuttled through the sword beam like a ghost in the river of time. She rushed in and landed on the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>“Do you know what the outcome of betrayal will be?” Perfect Sword Immortal stared coldly at Cave Era. The sword intent on his body was still expanding crazily. Jiang Yan’s body was already half crystallized.</p>
<p>“I only know that Immortal is the owner of the League of Guardians.” As Cave Era spoke, she pressed her hands on the Chaos Egg. The condensed temporal powers instantly erupted, causing the surrounding time to distort and change, producing a phenomenon of temporal chaos. Even the Calamity-grade sword beam seemed to be stuck.</p>
<p>“Time… Samsara…” Cave Era screamed as though it was the only way to squeeze out the last bit of her strength.</p>
<p>She knew that she couldn’t injure Perfect Sword Immortal, much less stop him from unleashing his strength. The only thing she could do was take Zhou Wen away.</p>
<p>As long as she took Zhou Wen away, there was no reason for Perfect Sword Immortal to continue unleashing his might. Then, Jiang Yan might be able to live.</p>
<p>Time for the Chaos Egg was distorted as Cave Era and the Chaos Egg vanished into thin air, leaving the range of Perfect Sword Immortal’s domain.</p>
<p>However, less than three kilometers away from Perfect Sword Immortal’s domain, the Chaos Egg and Cave Era fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The glow over the Guardian armor on Cave Era’s body vanished as though it had fossilized.</p>
<p>With Terror-grade strength, Cave Era couldn’t withstand such expenditure required to continuously use two top temporal skills—Infinite Time and Samsara.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw everything from inside the Chaos Egg. At the instant the Chaos Egg and Cave Era dropped, Zhou Wen rushed out of the Chaos Egg and grabbed the enervated Cave Era. He wanted to use interstellar teleportation and head straight for Venus.</p>
<p>However, he soon realized that interstellar teleportation was still unusable. The surroundings lit up as Zhou Wen looked up and saw that the sky was completely enveloped by sword beams.</p>
<p>At some point in time, Perfect Sword Immortal was already floating in the sky like a sun. The light emitted from his body was the omnipresent sword beams.</p>
<p>“We didn’t make it after all?” Cave Era smiled bitterly. She had already tried her best to evacuate Zhou Wen, but the expenditure needed to escape the Calamity Zone was just too great. The spot she had brought Zhou Wen to was still too close.</p>
<p>Now that Perfect Sword Immortal’s Calamity Zone had expanded, she no longer had the strength to take Zhou Wen out.</p>
<p>“Traitor, it’s time to atone for your sins.” Perfect Sword Immortal looked down at Zhou Wen and Cave Era like a true immortal from the nine heavens.</p>
<p>At that moment, his gaze was mostly on Cave Era. At the same time, his body emitted blinding sword beams that illuminated everything like the sun. They were everywhere.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hadn’t advanced to the Terror grade and wanted to send Cave Era into the Chaos Bead, but the Chaos Bead required creatures to enter willingly. Cave Era was worried about Jiang Yan and had no intention of escaping, so Zhou Wen wasn’t able to send her in.</p>
<p>However, the Chaos Egg could only protect Zhou Wen. If he used the Chaos Egg now, he would have to leave Cave Era outside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t a goody two-shoes, but he wasn’t willing to watch Cave Era die. She was, after all, Jiang Yan’s sister and had tried to save him.</p>
<p>“I’ll just make a Hail Mary effort. If it works, you’ll live. If it doesn’t, I’ve done my best. Don’t blame me for escaping when the time comes.” Zhou Wen grabbed Cave Era and quickly instant transmitted.</p>
<p>When they phased into existence, Zhou Wen had already produced the Chaos Egg and shielded Cave Era behind him.</p>
<p>The sun-like sword beams were everywhere. They were struck the moment they phased into existence.</p>
<p>Thankfully, with the Chaos Egg in front of them, Cave Era wasn’t injured. Otherwise, with her present state, she would probably be dead.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg slammed into Cave Era and flew out like a cannonball. It slammed into a mountain range, snapping a mountain peak and smashing into a valley, thereby creating another huge hole at the bottom.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen came out of the Chaos Egg and pulled up Cave Era, who was coughing out blood. When he looked up, he realized that the sun-like Perfect Sword Immortal had already arrived less than five meters in front of them. He was staring coldly at them.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan, Jiang Yan, I hope you weren’t joking with me. Zhou Wen looked around, but he didn’t discover anything special.</p>
<p>This was the place where Jiang Yan had pointed out to Zhou Wen. He had tried his best to bring Cave Era here, hoping that there was something special here that he could utilize in his defense.</p>
<p>However, no matter how he looked at the area, he couldn’t see anything special about it. There wasn’t even a dimensional zone, so it was impossible for him to escape into one.</p>
<p>Perfect Sword Immortal didn’t wish to waste any more time. He once again unleashed a sword beam that resembled the sun, hoping to kill Zhou Wen and Cave Era together.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already planned on hiding in the Chaos Egg, but he suddenly realized that the sword beams stopped less than a meter away from them.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan really didn’t lie to me, but what’s going on? I didn’t discover any special powers nearby. What stopped this sword art? Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised as he looked at the sword beam that resembled sunlight. He looked up at Perfect Sword Immortal and saw him pressing his face with one hand, his body trembling slightly, as though he was in a battle with the heavens.</p>
<p>“You are too naive to think that you can vie for control of your body from me. Everything that belongs to you already belongs to me. What else can you use to vie with me?” Perfect Sword Immortal seemed to be muttering to himself. His tone was ruthless as he gradually lifted his face.</p>
<p>Although one couldn’t see his face under the mask, his eyes seemed to be returning to normal.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a petal that resembled a rose flew out of the valley. It passed through the layers of sword beams and landed on the forehead of Perfect Sword Immortal.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1388'>Chapter 1388: Jiang Yan’s Plan</h3>
<p>The strength of Perfect Sword Immortal was immense. Even the Chaos Egg couldn’t withstand the increasingly powerful sword beam.</p>
<p>As for the petal that looked extremely weak, it didn’t fly very fast. It actually passed through the layers of sword beams and landed on the forehead of Perfect Sword Immortal. This was somewhat unbelievable.</p>
<p>What was even more surprising was that after the petal landed on the forehead of Perfect Sword Immortal, it melted like snowflakes and seeped into his Guardian armor.</p>
<p>In the next second, purplish-red petals appeared over Perfect Sword Immortal’s body. In the blink of an eye, they enveloped his entire body, forming a floral armor.</p>
<p>Fairy Burial! Zhou Wen immediately widened his eyes.</p>
<p>He never expected Immortal to be Jiang Yan because Immortal’s Guardian wasn’t Fairy Burial.</p>
<p>Previously, he had joined Jiang Yan in his trip to contract his Guardian. How could he not be familiar with it? He recognized it at a glance.</p>
<p>So that’s how it is… It’s no wonder Cave Era wanted to save me… She was actually trying to save Jiang Yan… Zhou Wen finally understood. He had been puzzled as to why Cave Era would take such a huge risk to save him.</p>
<p>Just because he was her brother’s junior didn’t seem to make sense.</p>
<p>“You… You actually contracted two Guardians…” Perfect Sword Immortal already understood what had happened and knew why the sword beam couldn’t injure the petal.</p>
<p>He used Jiang Yan’s body to fight. In essence, the current Perfect Sword Immortal was actually Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>As for Fairy Burial, it had a contract with Jiang Yan. Furthermore, it wasn’t an ordinary Guardian contract. It was a Life-and-Death contract that went one step further. Jiang Yan’s injuries were equivalent to Fairy Burial being injured. Likewise for the converse. Therefore, Perfect Sword Immortal couldn’t injure Fairy Burial. Otherwise, he would be injuring himself.</p>
<p>Unless he abandoned Jiang Yan’s body, it was impossible for him to injure Fairy Burial.</p>
<p>That’s not right… What Guardian is this… Perfect Sword Immortal frowned slightly. The floral armor formed by the Guardian was actually absorbing and devouring his Calamity power.</p>
<p>Perfect Sword Immortal naturally sensed that the floral armor was only at the Terror grade, but for some reason, it could absorb his Calamity-grade power.</p>
<p>Although the absorption speed wasn’t fast, it was very rare to absorb something at a higher level. Perfect Sword Immortal vaguely felt that the power of the floral armor seemed to restrain him.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, he would have been able to control the Guardian that Jiang Yan had contracted since he had already occupied Jiang Yan’s body. However, the floral armor rejected him and refused to be under his control.</p>
<p>“Fairy Burial.” Jiang Yan obtained the power of Fairy Burial again and finally regained some control. However, he could only speak. Control over the rest of his body was still in the hands of Perfect Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>“Just this act deserves death. You’ve been hiding and plotting for so long because you want to use its power to devour me?” Perfect Sword Immortal said coldly. “I pity your ignorance. Although I don’t know why this Guardian’s power has a faint restraining effect on me, it’s still too weak. As long as I leave your body, I can easily destroy your body along with it.”</p>
<p>“But do you dare leave my body?” Jiang Yan said indifferently.</p>
<p>Perfect Sword Immortal understood what Jiang Yan meant. Without Jiang Yan’s body as support, he would be ostracized by Earth’s rules. When that happened, his strength would be greatly weakened.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen near him, he would probably die if he was weakened to the Terror grade. It would be useless even if he destroyed Jiang Yan’s body.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter; I can kill you after I’m done with him.” Perfect Sword Immortal turned to look at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Fairy Burial’s powers couldn’t deal much damage to him in a short period of time. The power it absorbed was only a tiny portion that didn’t affect his combat strength much.</p>
<p>All Perfect Sword Immortal needed to do was stick to his original plan and kill Zhou Wen before leaving Jiang Yan’s body to kill Jiang Yan and Fairy Burial.</p>
<p>However, Perfect Sword Immortal was still somewhat puzzled as to why Jiang Yan could contract two Guardians. In theory, an individual shouldn’t be able to contract two Guardians. Furthermore, Guardians wouldn’t be willing to share their contractors with other Guardians.</p>
<p>This was because Guardians were natural enemies with each other. They had been created to defeat each other. Guardians of different species shouldn’t be able to contract with the same person.</p>
<p>“Jiang Yan, what other plans do you have? Quick, tell me,” Zhou Wen shouted at Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>Since Jiang Yan had set up such a trap, there was likely a way to deal with Perfect Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>“My plan was for you to hold him back while I absorb his strength,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback before he flew into a rage. “F*ck you. Are you human? You call this a f*cking plan?”</p>
<p>“Don’t be anxious. That’s just Plan A. I still have Plan B.” Jiang Yan added.</p>
<p>“How can you still be in the mood to joke at a time like this? Quick, tell me,” Zhou Wen felt a little relieved as he retreated with Cave Era.</p>
<p>“Plan B is for you to severely injure Perfect Sword Immortal. This way, my absorption will be faster and the danger will be resolved faster,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>“Are you really speaking anything human?” Zhou Wen’s face darkened.</p>
<p>“Don’t feel so inferior. You have to have confidence in yourself. I’m very confident in you. Work hard and kill him. Also, protect my sister.” Jiang Yan’s tone was very relaxed, as though Perfect Sword Immortal was some random character that could be killed with a single strike.</p>
<p>“Are you done?” Perfect Sword Immortal’s voice seemed to emit a cold aura. It was obvious how furious he was.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan didn’t think much of him. He actually said that he wanted Zhou Wen to kill him.</p>
<p>“Should I say that you are optimistic or ignorant? Humans can’t even leave Earth. From the looks of it, it’s not without reason.” As Perfect Sword Immortal spoke, the sword beams on his body erupted like the sun again in a bid to kill Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Enter this.” Zhou Wen extended his hand and pulled Cave Era. Cave Era didn’t resist this time as she was pulled into the Chaos Bead by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, the Chaos Egg enveloped Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The omnipresent sword beams struck the Chaos Egg, instantly filling it up. Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to transfer it to Tyrant Behemoth as the continuous sword beams stabbed a few spots into the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the Chaos Egg was about to become a porcupine.</p>
<p>Inside the Chaos Egg that was riddled with holes, solid Essence Energy immediately vaporized when it encountered the outside air, turning into white Essence Energy that spewed out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw the sword beams penetrate the Chaos Egg and knew that it was difficult to dodge them. However, he was still a little short of breaking through the final barrier needed to advance to the Terror grade.</p>
<p>What am I short of? More and more sword beams appeared in front of Zhou Wen as some of them nearly stabbed him in the face.</p>
<p>“Die!” Perfect Sword Immortal squeezed out the last bit of his strength, hoping to kill Zhou Wen as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The blazing sword beam seemed to devour the entire world, destroying everything around it. Even dust particles were sliced apart by the sword beam.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1389'>Chapter 1389: Terror-grade</h3>
<p>The indestructible sword beams illuminated everything, wiping out everything. The already riddled Chaos Egg immediately shattered as Zhou Wen was no longer able to hold out.</p>
<p>Instant transmission was useless under such circumstances because the sword beam was everywhere. No matter where Zhou Wen instant transmitted to, he would be killed by the sword beam unless he could leave Perfect Sword Immortal’s Calamity Zone. That was naturally impossible.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hadn’t advanced to the Terror grade, but he had no choice but to make a last-ditch effort. He took out the Immortal Culling Sword, but his heavy heart kept sinking.</p>
<p>This was because the Immortal Culling Sword could only be used once. As for his surroundings, they were filled with sword beams. He would be penetrated by the myriad swords after slashing out.</p>
<p>What was even worse was that Zhou Wen knew very well that even if he used Immortal Slaying, he wouldn’t be able to slay such a powerful Perfect Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>His strength was too weak; he was unable to unleash the full might of the Immortal Culling Sword. A full-powered strike was equivalent to a Calamity-grade strike. Such an attack couldn’t hit Perfect Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen even realized that the speed at which he could draw out his sword couldn’t keep up with his thoughts. The sword beam had already arrived in front of him before he could pull out the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>Am I just dying like that? Zhou Wen held his sword and looked at the dazzling sword beam that was everywhere. He felt fear and indignation.</p>
<p>Although there was no time for him to think too much, the instinctive fear arose spontaneously.</p>
<p>Suddenly!</p>
<p>The sword beam that could destroy everything stopped in front of Zhou Wen. The tip of the sword beam was almost in contact with Zhou Wen’s cornea.</p>
<p>To suddenly live in the face of impending death, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but tremble. It was as though a gust of cold air instantly rushed to his head from the soles of his feet and spread to his entire body. It made Zhou Wen feel a little hot. His face warmed up as though he had a fever; his legs went limp as his head spun.</p>
<p>The feeling of having made a trip to the gates of hell was something that only those involved could understand.</p>
<p>As the saying went, there was great horror between life and death, but it was very difficult to experience it.</p>
<p>This was because the person would already be dead when they experienced it. It was useless even if they experienced it.</p>
<p>Those who could experience the horror of life and death and survive were extremely lucky. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that it was a rebirth.</p>
<p>At that instant, Zhou Wen experienced the horror of life and death. His mind immediately became clear as a mirror. Many things that he usually cared about were nothing when he thought about them. It was ridiculous to be sad over them.</p>
<p>At the same time, Zhou Wen finally understood why he couldn’t take the final step to advance to the Terror grade. This was because he had never experienced true fear, so how could he understand the terror of others?</p>
<p>Only people who had truly experienced fear understood what fear was.</p>
<p>“What are you waiting for? Use your sword to kill him!” Jiang Yan’s voice boomed in almost a roar, but he knew that it was already too late when he shouted.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen still hadn’t reacted; Jiang Yan’s heart immediately turned cold.</p>
<p>The best he could do was use this split second to use all the power Burial Immortal had gathered and its unique abilities. He could regain control from Perfect Sword Immortal while his control over the body was weakest during his delivery of a full-might attack.</p>
<p>He originally imagined that there was this unspoken understanding between him and Zhou Wen. That instant was enough for Zhou Wen to slash out with an earth-shattering strike. The strike that had once killed a dimensional Calamity—the strike that belonged to Human Sovereign.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen blanked out at such a critical moment and missed that instant.</p>
<p>“What a pity. You sure are scheming and resourceful.” Perfect Sword Immortal had already regained control of his body. He too broke out into a cold sweat.</p>
<p>He never expected Jiang Yan to be able to regain control of the body. Although it was only for an instant, it was enough to shock him.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen had reacted in time, he might have been severely injured.</p>
<p>When he saw the Immortal Culling Sword in Zhou Wen’s hand, he recognized Zhou Wen’s identity and knew that Zhou Wen indeed had the ability to severely injure him.</p>
<p>“So Zhou Wen is Human Sovereign. What a pity. Humans are only humans after all. They are ultimately unable to face the extreme fear of death calmly. He missed his only chance and wasted your efforts,” Perfect Sword Immortal said with a sneer. “Jiang Yan, my dear Jiang Yan, you are indeed a talent. However, you chose the wrong person and stood on the wrong side.”</p>
<p>Jiang Yan was exhausted from unleashing all his strength. He didn’t even have the ability to control the body and make sounds.</p>
<p>“Don’t make the wrong choice again in your next life.” Perfect Sword Immortal once again controlled his sword beam to shoot out, hoping to kill Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, when he looked at Zhou Wen, he was surprised to discover that Zhou Wen’s body was emitting a strange aura. The aura made him extremely disgusted and even somewhat afraid.</p>
<p>Terror transformation? Wasn’t that ball his Terror transformation power? Perfect Sword Immortal sized up Zhou Wen suspiciously, having originally believed that the Chaos Egg was Zhou Wen’s Terror-grade power.</p>
<p>However, from the changes in Zhou Wen’s body, it was a sign that he had just advanced to the Terror form. This left him in disbelief.</p>
<p>He couldn’t believe that a human who had fought him for so long wasn’t even at the Terror grade.</p>
<p>However, Perfect Sword Immortal couldn’t care less. He drove ten thousand sword beams downwards. Regardless of whether he was at the Terror or Mythical stage prior to this, that could be discussed after he was dead.</p>
<p>The sun-like sword beams devoured Zhou Wen, and in the blinding sword beam, a very discordant light suddenly appeared.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>The ten thousand sword beams shattered like glass and scattered in all directions. The thousands of sword beams rose up and deflected light, making the surroundings appear dreamy.</p>
<p>A sword beam tore through everything, splitting the shattered sword beams that filled the sky into two. It was as though the sea had been parted as a sword beam charged straight at Perfect Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>Perfect Sword Immortal condensed a sword with his fingers, converging the sword beams around him into one as he faced the sword beam.</p>
<p>“All the swords in this world obey my orders. You have a death wish to fight me with a sword…” As Perfect Sword Immortal spoke, his sword beam had already collided with his adversary’s sword beam.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The sword beams collided, producing a terrifying shockwave.</p>
<p>Perfect Sword Immortal’s heart palpitated as he dodged to the side, but he was still a little slow. A bloody mark immediately appeared on his cheek when the sword beam swept past him. A drop of blood slowly dripped down his cheek.</p>
<p>What’s wrong with that sword… Why is its power able to restrain my sword beam… Impossible… How can there be a sword in the world that I can’t control… The eyes of Perfect Sword Immortal widened into a contortion as he stared opposite him. He saw Zhou Wen walking over with the Immortal Culling Sword in hand. The Heavenly Robe on his body fluttered in the wind. He had not been injured.</p>
<p>“Why wait for the next life? I think I can choose again now.” Zhou Wen felt the power in his body and the sword intent that roared like an evil spirit from Immortal Culling Sword. This was the first time he had been able to freely control the Immortal Culling Sword and not just draw it and slash it once.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1390'>Chapter 1390: Terror-grade Combat Strength</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“All the swords in the world might be under your jurisdiction, but this sword of mine isn’t,” Zhou Wen said as he slashed out with the Immortal Culling Sword again.</p>
<p>It was an onslaught of sword aura!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt Slaughterer constantly spew out Essence Energy. After the Immortal Culling Sword—which had extremely high Essence Energy requirements—accepted the endless Essence Energy, it trembled and hummed.</p>
<p>It was like a parched land’s desire for rain, the satisfaction of a hungry wolf when it ate meat.</p>
<p>The Immortal Culling Sword had been thirsty and hungry for too long. Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy in the past wasn’t enough to power it. Every time Zhou Wen had used the Immortal Culling Sword, it was like giving a person dying of thirst a drop of water. Not only did this drop of water not quench his thirst, but it only made him yearn for more.</p>
<p>Hum! Hum!</p>
<p>Under Zhou Wen’s brandishing, the Immortal Culling Sword produced a humming sword hum as it slashed out sword beams.</p>
<p>Perfect Sword Immortal condensed sword beams to fight Zhou Wen, but he was alarmed to discover that his sword beams were restrained by Zhou Wen’s sword beams. It was like a mortal weapon encountering a divine weapon that could slice through steel as though it was mud. Anything would be sliced apart the moment it came into contact with it.</p>
<p>Retreat! Another retreat!</p>
<p>Perfect Sword Immortal was alarmed to discover that he could only retreat again and again under Zhou Wen’s sword.</p>
<p>He wanted to counterattack with his sword, but for some reason, Zhou Wen’s sword technique made him uncomfortable. It was like a sword beam restraining his sword radiance. It made him feel uncomfortable—he was unable to unleash his full combat strength.</p>
<p>Perfect Sword Immortal suddenly had a feeling—a subconscious feeling—as though he was afraid of Zhou Wen. This fear was in his bones, like it was a part of his nature.</p>
<p>What… What’s going on… A Terror-grade… Just a Terror-grade human… How can this be… How can this be… The eyes of Perfect Sword Immortal flickered as cracks appeared in his defenses. Terror constantly spread in his heart.</p>
<p>Blood Shaman and Uesugi Nao, who were watching from afar, stared blankly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen is Human Sovereign! Uesugi Nao watched as Zhou Wen’s sword forced Perfect Sword Immortal into a retreat. The powerful Perfect Sword Immortal that left one in despair was completely suppressed, as though he didn’t even have the chance to counterattack.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“He… is at the Terror grade, right?” Blood Shaman said with a strange expression.</p>
<p>No one could answer him. Only the earth-shattering sword aura and sword hum echoed in the world.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt as though he was in an invincible state. It wasn’t just because the Immortal Culling Sword had erupted with powerful combat strength, but more because of the power Slaughterer and the advancement to the Terror grade had given him.</p>
<p>In the past, Zhou Wen needed to make all kinds of observations and plans to deduce the enemy’s weakness, but now, it seemed very natural. Without needing much observation, he could attack his opponent’s weakness as though it had become an instinct.</p>
<p>This instinct wasn’t without reason, but a judgment based on some rules.</p>
<p>It was like learning a math formula. No matter how varied the questions were, as long as one grasped the formulas, they could obtain answers without looking at all possible questions.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was such an example. He didn’t need to see the weaknesses of all creatures to determine his opponent’s weaknesses.</p>
<p>This feeling was simply intoxicating. It was as though he could see through everything at a glance. It felt like God.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Together with the power unleashed by the Immortal Culling Sword, as well as its ability to restrain immortals, along with Zhou Wen’s Heart Defying Sword Art, he forcefully suppressed Perfect Sword Immortal to the point of him being unable to counterattack.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for the fact that the body belonged to Jiang Yan, the Immortal Culling Sword would have killed Perfect Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>Perfect Sword Immortal seemed to notice this as well. He stopped defending and transformed into a sword beam, hoping to escape.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen’s speed wasn’t as fast as Perfect Sword Immortal, he had the help of spatial teleportation. After Slaughterer advanced to the Terror grade, Zhou Wen experienced a tremendous change.</p>
<p>This change didn’t only improve his physique a little. In fact, it had a greater effect on his other Terror transformation abilities.</p>
<p>For example, in his true Terror form, he could use the Godfiend Era’s instant transmission almost instantly. It wasn’t like before where there was an obvious pause.</p>
<p>For example, using Singularity Universe’s teleportation ability greatly increased accuracy.</p>
<p>The other Terror transformation abilities seemed to be augmented by a halo under Zhou Wen’s Terror transformation. They were greatly enhanced.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could virtually instant transmit an infinite number of times, so he managed to catch up to the Calamity-grade Perfect Sword Immortal. He constantly slashed out with the Immortal Culling Sword, forcing Perfect Sword Immortal to dodge in a sorry state.</p>
<p>Perfect Sword Immortal had also attempted to let the Immortal Culling Sword slash at Jiang Yan’s body, but he was alarmed to discover that after the Immortal Culling Sword injured Jiang Yan’s body, it carried a strange power. The power directly injured his immortal body, but it didn’t injure Jiang Yan’s body. It was as though it was a power born to deal with immortals.</p>
<p>Perfect Sword Immortal was alarmed, unhinged with anger. He never expected to end up in such a sorry state on his descent to Earth.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, Jiang Yan, I’ll remember you.” Perfect Sword Immortal wanted to escape Jiang Yan’s body and return to the dimension.</p>
<p>However, he was even more alarmed to discover that he couldn’t leave Jiang Yan’s body. The floral armor-like Fairy Burial seemed to have some mysterious power that imprisoned the soul that had descended into Jiang Yan’s body.</p>
<p>How can this be! Perfect Sword Immortal felt extreme regret. He never expected that his casual decision would result in his death.</p>
<p>It was already impossible to destroy Fairy Burial.</p>
<p>This was because the Fairy Burial armor had already fused with the Skyimmortal armor. As for the Skyimmortal armor, it was a Calamity-grade armor that the Perfect Sword Immortal had helped advance. Furthermore, in the battle with Zhou Wen, he had sent a large amount of Immortal Essence sword aura into the Skyimmortal armor. Now, the Skyimmortal armor was truly at the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Coupled with the fusion with Fairy Burial, it had the power to restrain Perfect Sword Immortal’s Essence Energy, preventing him from suicidally destroying Jiang Yan’s body.</p>
<p>“Don’t you think it’s too late to leave now?” Jiang Yan said, finally regaining partial control.</p>
<p>Perfect Sword Immortal immediately felt that things were going south, but it was too late. Jiang Yan unleashed the power of Fairy Burial again and temporarily regained control of his body.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen didn’t miss the opportunity. The Immortal Culling Sword left his hand and transformed into a sword beam that instantly pierced through Perfect Sword Immortal’s body, pinning him to the mountain wall.</p>
<p>The power of Immortal Culling Sword instantly spread across Perfect Sword Immortal’s body. The power was extremely harmful to him, but it didn’t deal much damage to Jiang Yan’s body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already discovered this in the battle just now. Although the Immortal Culling Sword could kill other creatures with similarly powerful destructive power, it had a special lethality against Perfect Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>When it injured ordinary creatures, the wound wouldn’t continue extending, but it was different for Perfect Sword Immortal.. After injuring him, the wound would continue to damage his immortal body.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1391'>Chapter 1391: The Disqualified</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Perfect Sword Immortal was severely injured by the Immortal Culling Sword. Although Jiang Yan’s body was also injured, it wasn’t as serious as Perfect Sword Immortal, nor did he suffer from constant damage.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, he finally regained control of most of his body. At the same time, Fairy Burial, who had fused with the Skyimmortal armor, crazily plundered and absorbed Perfect Sword Immortal’s energy.</p>
<p>Facing the pincer attack of the Immortal Culling Sword and Fairy Burial, Perfect Sword Immortal lost his voice bit by bit amidst the painful roars. Finally, he was completely absorbed by Fairy Burial.</p>
<p>The floral armor on Jiang Yan’s body was red to the point of turning purple. It was extremely beautiful, like red spider lilies that had fallen into hell.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan reached out to grab the hilt of Fairy Burial and pulled it out of his body before throwing it back to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“You came too early. If you had given me more time for preparations, I wouldn’t be in such a sorry state.” Jiang Yan looked at the wound on his body. The blood armor seemed to have a life of its own as it rooted itself in the wound and quickly healed his injured body.</p>
<p>“You didn’t inform me. How would I know what you were up to?” Zhou Wen rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>“If I had told you in advance, even if you could fool everyone, I wouldn’t be able to fool Perfect Sword Immortal who possessed me. Only when everything is real can Perfect Sword Immortal sink deeper and not have the chance to escape again,” Jiang Yan said with a smile. “Thankfully, you didn’t disappoint me. Although there were some tiny mishaps, the goal was finally achieved.”</p>
<p>“My heart isn’t too good. Please get someone else if you are doing this again,” Zhou Wen said angrily.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t the one looking for you, alright? You came knocking by yourself!” Jiang Yan said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was taken aback, but he knew that what Jiang Yan said made sense. Jiang Yan was only taking advantage of the situation. Even without Jiang Yan, the League of Guardians would still deal with him. A figure like Perfect Sword Immortal would still descend. It was only a matter of time.</p>
<p>“What plans do you have for the future?” Zhou Wen released Cave Era and asked Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>“I’m the owner of the League of Guardians. I was in the past and will be in the future.” Jiang Yan looked at Uesugi Nao, Blood Shaman, and the other Guardians.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao, Blood Shaman, and the other Guardians flew over and said in unison, “We are willing to continue following you, Your Excellency.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you afraid that the dimensional fellows will deal with you?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I was afraid in the past, but now that my Skyimmortal and Fairy Burial have advanced to the Calamity grade, there’s no need to be afraid. It’s not that easy for dimensional creatures to come to Earth. Even if they do, they will be greatly suppressed. Up to now, only humans can allow Calamity-grade creatures to exist on Earth. They can’t even send Calamity-grade creatures over. Even if they descend with the help of a body, they will at most be at the Calamity grade. Do you think I need to be afraid?” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>“Alright, take care. Goodbye… No… There’s nothing good about it. It’s best we don’t meet again…” Zhou Wen waved his hand and prepared to leave.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to help you finish that?” Jiang Yan pointed at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He looked down and realized that the Heavenly Tribulation Sword he had been hit with was still embedded in his chest. It was still emitting lightning.</p>
<p>“Well, if you hadn’t mentioned it, I would have forgotten. This thing can’t really injure people. I wonder how Perfect Sword Immortal managed to master such a useless skill.” Zhou Wen felt that although the Heavenly Tribulation was still ongoing, it didn’t affect him much. He had already forgotten about it as he was focused on the battle. It was obvious how useless the Heavenly Tribulation Sword was to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan glanced at Zhou Wen with a complicated expression. He had absorbed Perfect Sword Immortal, so he knew some of his abilities. The Heavenly Tribulation Sword’s attack wasn’t targeted at the body, but the mind. Under the nine instances of Heavenly Tribulation, even a Calamity-grade creature would most likely become an idiot or lunatic. They might even be erased or turned into a vegetative state. There were many who couldn’t withstand it and committed suicide.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t react to the nine tribulations of the Heavenly Tribulation Sword. Others didn’t know how terrifying it was, but Jiang Yan knew very well that this wasn’t a reaction a human should have.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder Teacher said that about him, Jiang Yan thought.</p>
<p>“I’m leaving.” Zhou Wen waved his hand and turned to leave. He didn’t get Jiang Yan to help him pull out the Heavenly Tribulation Sword. After advancing to the Terror grade, his understanding of various powers had improved significantly. He knew that the Heavenly Tribulation Sword would quickly dissipate.</p>
<p>After using teleportation to leave, with the augmentation of his Terror state, Singularity Universe’s location-locking was much more accurate. Zhou Wen teleported to the vicinity of Luoyang, and the deviation was only about five kilometers. It was much better than before.</p>
<p>When he arrived at an empty spot, Zhou Wen eagerly took out his phone and checked his stats.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen: Terror</p>
<p>Life Providence: Sigh of the King</p>
<p>Life Soul: Slaughterer</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: No Engravings (One Spin)</p>
<p>Terror Form: The Disqualified (Beyond S)</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Strength: 82</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at his information and fell into a daze.</p>
<p>He originally imagined that his Terror grade was the upgraded version of Slaughterer, but from the looks of it, that wasn’t the case. Slaughterer had indeed undergone Terror transformation, and its name was Slaughterer. Like the other eight Terror transformation abilities, it had an S-grade Terror transformation ability.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s true Terror transformation ability wasn’t Slaughterer, but The Disqualified. Although it had a certain relationship with Slaughterer, it was somewhat different.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen entered The Disqualified state, he gained an extremely powerful augmentation for the other nine Terror states. He also had the ability to spy on weaknesses like before. However, this ability wasn’t constant. It varied according to the different target creatures.</p>
<p>This ability was relatively powerful for common lifeforms. The effects on rare creatures would be weaker, but it wasn’t completely ineffective.</p>
<p>Apart from that, The Disqualified had a very strong augmentation on various parts of his physique, including his senses. Otherwise, even if Zhou Wen’s strength could keep up with Perfect Sword Immortal in battle, his eyesight and reaction would be far inferior—it would still be difficult for him to match him.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen’s various abilities were very close to the Calamity grade in The Disqualified state.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen still needed to continue studying the other abilities of The Disqualified. After all, he had just condensed it, so he didn’t understand it fully.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pulled out Tyrant Behemoth’s information, hoping to see how far it had advanced.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth: Terror (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Extreme Strength</p>
<p>Life Soul: Violent Crown</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Absolute Strength</p>
<p>Terror Form: Tyrant</p>
<p>Strength: 82</p>
<p>Speed: 82</p>
<p>Constitution: 82</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 82</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Mountain Consuming</p>
<p>Companion Form: Boxing Glove</p>
<p>He switched on his phone and randomly chose a dungeon.. Zhou Wen wanted to see what changes Tyrant Behemoth would undergo when it entered its Terror form.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1392'>Chapter 1392: Blood Spirits</h3>
<p>The Yang City dungeon had happened to finish refreshing, so Zhou Wen entered it with Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Due to his previous experience, Zhou Wen didn’t dare touch the blood bone temples. All he did was make Tyrant Behemoth enter its Terror form—the Tyrant state.</p>
<p>The Terror-form Tyrant Behemoth instantly became as huge as a mountain. A crown appeared on its head as its black iron-like body suffused a red glow.</p>
<p>Its eyes suffused a red glow as a red glow also shimmered in its mouth. It looked like a devil that shimmered with a sanguine glow in the dark night.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth landed. As it was so huge, it stepped onto a blood bone temple.</p>
<p>Terror-grade creatures immediately rushed out of the blood bone temple, transforming into terrifying blood shadows that charged at Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen felt that Tyrant Behemoth couldn’t defeat the dozen or so Terror-grade creatures, he had no intention of helping. He wanted to see how powerful Tyrant Behemoth was.</p>
<p>More than ten Terror-grade blood shadows rushed over from different directions. Tyrant Behemoth roared at the sky as the sanguine light over its body transformed into blood flames that burned around its body.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth suddenly exerted strength at a terrifying speed. As its massive body moved, it produced afterimages.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>A Terror-grade blood shadow suspected to be a Whirl Turtle was pierced through by Tyrant Behemoth’s claw. Its sharp claws sank into its body as it roared and ripped its body apart. Then, it picked up the corpse and threw it into its mouth. It chewed a few times before swallowing. It was as violent as a devil.</p>
<p>Kill! Kill! Kill!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched Tyrant Behemoth fight the group alone with no inkling of what retreat was. It ignored the enemy’s attacks and seemed to only have eyes for its opponents.</p>
<p>Absolute Strength at the Terror grade was too powerful. In a head-on clash, no Terror-grade creature was Tyrant Behemoth’s match. They were either torn apart by Tyrant Behemoth or smashed into meat paste.</p>
<p>However, Tyrant Behemoth kept attacking without delivering any defensive manuveurs. It was also hit by many forces. Although its body was very powerful, it didn’t have Absolute Defense. It still suffered quite a number of injuries and some of them were rather serious.</p>
<p>A blood shadow that resembled an ox or a goat slammed into Tyrant Behemoth’s waist. The horns that were more than ten meters long stabbed right in.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth let out a tragic cry before grabbing the blood shadow and pulling it in front of it. It grabbed its head with one hand and its tail with the other before pulling.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched as the blood shadow’s body gradually extended. Amidst the inhuman screams, its body snapped like a rubber band as blood spewed everywhere.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth fought crazily. What surprised Zhou Wen was that its injuries healed extremely quickly. It could even be said to be abnormally fast.</p>
<p>Under the siege of the Terror-grade creatures, Tyrant Behemoth became more and more ferocious. It didn’t weaken because of its injuries. Instead, as the blood shadows’ numbers decreased, their position of disadvantage became more and more obvious.</p>
<p>After carefully observing for a while, Zhou Wen realized that Tyrant Behemoth could quickly recover from its injuries not because its physique was strong, but because it had devoured many opponents in battle.</p>
<p>The energy obtained from its opponent quickly healed its body. It was simply nourishing itself with food. As long as the injuries on its body weren’t fatal and as long as it had something to eat, it was almost a perpetual motion machine.</p>
<p>This fellow’s combat style is so strange! However, Absolute Strength is really useful. At the same level, Tyrant Behemoth is almost an invincible existence. The more Zhou Wen watched, the more he liked it. He only felt that Tyrant Behemoth’s body was a little weak. If it could have Absolute Defense, it would be perfect.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Absolute Defense was Prisoned Dragon’s ability. It was unlikely it would appear on Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>After understanding Tyrant Behemoth’s true strength, Zhou Wen realized that something was amiss. Tyrant Behemoth had already killed nearly ten Terror-grade blood shadows, but no items had dropped.</p>
<p>There wasn’t even a single dimensional crystal, much less Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at the game’s notification box and realized that the in-game notifications were ‘Killed XXX’s Blood Spirit.” Only then did Zhou Wen come to a realization. The blood shadows here weren’t the true legendary Terror creatures. They were just undead.</p>
<p>There was no problem with being undead, but the problem was that nothing dropped. This left Zhou Wen depressed. He attempted to activate some blood bone temples and killed the blood shadows, but the outcome was the same. Nothing dropped.</p>
<p>What crappy dungeon is this? It doesn’t drop anything. Zhou Wen was greatly disappointed.</p>
<p>He originally imagined that he had found a treasure ground that could spawn some Terror-grade Companion Eggs, but nothing dropped.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen knew that there was definitely something impressive in such a strange place. More importantly, he didn’t know if he could kill the Calamity creature guarding it.</p>
<p>Without the Immortal Culling Sword in-game, Zhou Wen could only rely on himself and his Companion Beasts in battle.</p>
<p>Since I’m already here, let me see what secrets are hidden in Yang City. Zhou Wen summoned Banana Fairy, Demonic Neonate, and other Companion Beasts and stormed in.</p>
<p>There were many Terror-grade blood shadows here, and Zhou Wen had quite a number of Terror-grade Companion Beasts. Furthermore, they were all excellent. Every one of them could fight a group alone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched for a while before he suddenly thought of something.</p>
<p>The Blood Spirits here were likely transformed from the wraiths of the Classic of Mountains and Seas beasts killed during the reign of Yu the Great. The strength of the Blood Spirits is naturally far inferior to the true Classic of Mountains and Seas beasts.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen even saw a phoenix-like Blood Spirit, but its strength was only considered top-notch at the Terror grade. It was probably much weaker than a real phoenix.</p>
<p>Such a Blood Spirit didn’t drop anything, so it could be said to be useless to others.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had The Disqualified which had the ability to sense his opponent’s weakness. This ability actually required a certain level of support. If it was a creature that Zhou Wen had never seen before, the effects of the ability would be much weaker.</p>
<p>Although the Blood Spirits here were much weaker than their original versions, their abilities weren’t fake. All Zhou Wen needed to do was familiarize himself with their abilities and attributes. When he encountered a true Classic of Mountains and Seas beast, he could directly sense their weaknesses. It was equivalent to knowing their weaknesses in advance.</p>
<p>This ain’t too bad. Zhou Wen originally found it pointless, but after this discovery, he became interested and carefully observed the abilities of every Blood Spirit.</p>
<p>As he was observing, a strange temple appeared in front of him.</p>
<p>In Yang City, the buildings Zhou Wen had seen were made of blood bones, but the temple in front of him wasn’t made of bones or clay bricks. It was a stone temple.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth was still burning with its killing fervor as it charged forward. Just as it was about to approach the stone temple, its door suddenly opened. A bull was lying inside.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1393'>Chapter 1393: Kui</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated when he saw the bull. He immediately knew that something was amiss and wanted to unsummon his Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he was still a step too late. The bull opened its mouth and let out a thunderous roar.</p>
<p>The roar was like a bull’s or dragon’s, but it also sounded like a clap of thunder. Zhou Wen even saw light that resembled the sun and moon spew out from its mouth. As the roar sounded, it instantly illuminated half of Yang City.</p>
<p>Why was it half a Yang City? It was because the stone temple was in the middle of Yang City. Only the front of the stone temple was illuminated.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he made a decision without any hesitation. He immediately instant transmited to the area behind the stone temple.</p>
<p>When he phased into existence again, his body was immediately thrown to the ground by the terrifying sound wave. His innards churned as though his blood vessels were about to explode.</p>
<p>However, this was already considered good. Tyrant Behemoth and the other Companion Beasts suffered the power of the terrifying sound wave in the area in front of the stone temple. Their bodies exploded and turned into a bloody mist.</p>
<p>Even a Terror-grade creature with a powerful body like Tyrant Behemoth couldn’t withstand it. Only Banana Fairy acted fast. Like Zhou Wen, she fled to the area behind the stone temple to avoid being killed by the sound waves.</p>
<p>Her situation was similar to Zhou Wen’s. She was also injured from the shock, and her injuries were worse than Zhou Wen’s.</p>
<p>As for Demonic Neonate, she kept hugging the Demonic Sword while sitting on Zhou Wen’s shoulder. Although she had also been attacked by the sound waves, she looked fine.</p>
<p>I was probably killed by this fellow’s roar the last time. I have to investigate what it is. As Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar, he took out his other phone and opened the browser to search online.</p>
<p>This thing… Don’t tell me it’s a Kui… The more Zhou Wen looked at it, the more it looked like it.</p>
<p>Although he had only taken a glance, he knew that the bull in the stone temple didn’t have horns and was still lying there.</p>
<p>According to the information he had found on the Internet, Kui didn’t have horns on its head and only had one leg.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t see how many legs it had, but it was lying there and not standing. It was very likely that it didn’t want to keep standing because it only had one leg.</p>
<p>This discovery excited Zhou Wen because the bull was clearly not a Blood Spirit. It was a creature with flesh and blood.</p>
<p>According to the information on the Internet, every time the Kui appeared, it would be accompanied by a storm. Furthermore, it had the light of the sun and moon on its body as it roared like thunder.</p>
<p>Legend has it that when Yellow Emperor discovered the Kui, the Mysterious Maiden used its hide to make a drum and its bones as drumsticks. One strike of the drum quaked 250 kilometers out, no one could stop it.</p>
<p>This thing was definitely an excellent-grade music-type Companion Beast. Now, Zhou Wen didn’t have any music-type Companion Beasts. If he could obtain Kui, it would make up for the weakness.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still fantasizing when he heard another clap of thunder. It gave him a fright, making him believe that the Kui had roared again.</p>
<p>However, when he looked up, he realized that it was true thunder, not the sound of the Kui.</p>
<p>Dark clouds gathered above Yang City as thunder rumbled. Then, without any warning, it began to pour heavily.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned his head to look in the direction of the stone temple and indeed, he saw the bull exit. Its upper body was raised as it hopped forward. On careful look, it really only had one leg.</p>
<p>It walked with one leg as the light on its body resembled the sun and moon. It was very similar to the information Zhou Wen had obtained.</p>
<p>Kui stood in the rain and looked at Zhou Wen before roaring again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen already knew that Kui’s sound wave attack was directional. Although sound could spread in all directions, being right in front of the wavefront would deal the greatest damage. As long as he dodged the wavefront, the damage he suffered would be minimized.</p>
<p>After unsummoning Banana Fairy, he instant transmitted again. This time, he appeared in a sport furthest behind Kui. The sound waves he suffered were indeed greatly reduced.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s Terror transformation ability, he was basically unaffected by the sound waves.</p>
<p>Kui jumped up and turned its body to face Zhou Wen as it roared again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued instant transmitting in another direction. Kui kept blasting out sound waves, but Zhou Wen dodged them all. He couldn’t help but be furious.</p>
<p>Kui stopped looking for Zhou Wen. It looked up and let out an unhinged roar into the sky.</p>
<p>The dark clouds and storm were dispersed by its roar. The roar was accompanied by light as it radiated in all directions like a sound wave, forming an indiscriminate attack.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen had nowhere to dodge. All he could do was forcefully resist the sound waves.</p>
<p>He summoned the reformed Chaos Egg and the sound waves struck the Chaos Egg, immediately producing many solid crystals. Unfortunately, Tyrant Behemoth was already dead. Otherwise, he could have used them to feed it.</p>
<p>Kui roared a few times consecutively, causing the Chaos Egg to tumble out. It slammed into the city wall and bounced back. It slammed into the various temples like a ball.</p>
<p>In the blood bone temples that Zhou Wen had slammed into, Blood Spirits quickly rushed out, but they had nothing on the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took the opportunity when Kui was exhausted from the roar to instantly appear behind it. Using his hand as a blade, he delivered Immortal Slaying.</p>
<p>Even without the augmentation of the Immortal Culling Sword, Zhou Wen’s Immortal Slaying was still very powerful. The power that erupted was almost comparable to a Calamity-grade.</p>
<p>However, when he struck Kui’s neck, it only produced a shallow wound. Furthermore, the wound quickly healed itself. It was useless.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Kui constantly fought. Neither side could do a thing to the other.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg could withstand Kui’s sound blast, and Kui couldn’t catch up to Zhou Wen. There were no other means to injure Zhou Wen or kill him.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen could injure Kui, due to its powerful physique and how Zhou Wen’s offensive strength was only able to touch the threshold of the Calamity grade, he couldn’t severely injure it. Likewise, he couldn’t kill it.</p>
<p>Finally, Zhou Wen gave up by quitting the game. There was no point in continuing. The injuries he dealt Kui weren’t as fast as its self-healing speed.</p>
<p>This won’t do. I have to think of a way to get a good weapon. Zhou Wen was thinking about where to get a Calamity-grade weapon.</p>
<p>If he couldn’t obtain a Calamity-grade weapon, he had to obtain a Terror-grade weapon with extremely powerful destructive power. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to kill Kui.</p>
<p>The Bamboo Blade has shattered, and the Son of Heaven’s Sword can’t be pulled out. Although the Immortal Culling Sword is useful, it can’t be brought into the game. Where can I get a weapon? After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that only the boxing glove transformed by Tyrant Behemoth could be counted on.</p>
<p>After all, with the augmentation of Absolute Strength, Tyrant Behemoth’s boxing glove’s offensive strength was undoubtedly top-notch among Terror-grade weapons.</p>
<p>The only flaw was that it wasn’t augmented by skills, so it couldn’t produce effects similar to Ever-Victorious and Unstoppable.</p>
<p>If I don’t have one, I’ll fuse one and let Tyrant Behemoth’s boxing glove have those skills. Zhou Wen made up his mind to add all sorts of augmentation skills to Tyrant Behemoth’s boxing glove.</p>

<p>“Who dares to barge into the Octokind’s land?” The Yaksha and Garuda, who were guarding the Octokind Holy Mountain, immediately berated when they saw an outsider walking towards the Holy Mountain.</p>
<p>The person looked like a man in his thirties, but his hair was white; his white clothes were whiter than snow. He walked over step by step. He clearly walked on the ground, but he gave off the feeling that he was walking on clouds.</p>
<p>It was as if the ground beneath his feet was no longer dirty, but pure white clouds.</p>
<p>The man didn’t answer and continued walking over.</p>
<p>The Yaksha and Garuda were immediately enraged. Those who were sent to guard the Holy Mountain were the cream of the crop among the Octokind. They could be said to be elites, so when had they ever been belittled?</p>
<p>They erupted with Terror-grade power and attacked the white-robed man from both sides.</p>
<p>The white-robed man continued walking forward as though he hadn’t seen them. As for the Yaksha and Garuda, they flew up with tragic cries.</p>
<p>It was as though invisible sword intents flashed, slicing their strength and bodies to pieces, turning them into a rain of blood.</p>
<p>The white-haired man stepped onto the stone steps of the Holy Mountain as though nothing had happened. The spot where he stood was clean and flawless, but behind him was blood-stained yellow sand.</p>
<p>The Yaksha and Garuda’s tragic cries before they died had already alarmed the Octokind on the mountain. Many rushed down the mountain and were enraged when they saw the blood on the ground and the white-haired man who was climbing the mountain.</p>
<p>Many irascible Asuras and Yakshas had already charged at the white-haired man. The sky was filled with a strange light as though countless stars were crashing down at him.</p>
<p>The white-haired man didn’t even raise his eyelids as he continued walking up the stone steps.</p>
<p>Without exception, the Octokind that charged at him were all killed by the invisible sword intent. Sabers, swords, spears, musical instruments, and all sorts of broken weapons were sent flying with bloodied flesh.</p>
<p>Wherever the white-haired man passed, no Octokind survived.</p>
<p>On the huge Holy Mountain, more than ten thousand members of the Octokind had gathered, but no one dared to approach the white-haired man.</p>
<p>With every step the white-haired man took, the Octokind that filled the sky involuntarily retreated. No one dared to resist him.</p>
<p>“We Octokind have always had a good relationship with the Immortals. As a member of the Immortals, why are you slaughtering the creatures of our Octokind? Could it be that the Immortals are violating the dimensional agreement?” A dancing, lute-wielding Gandharva floated in the air and stared at the white-haired man who was ascending the mountain as she asked.</p>
<p>The Immortal ignored her and continued walking up the mountain as though he was deaf.</p>
<p>“I’m talking to you. Didn’t you hear me? I’m the Queen of the Gandharva. If there’s anything you need, you can tell me. If there’s nothing, don’t blame me for being heartless if you take another step forward,” said the Gandharva as her expression turned cold. She hugged her lute and stared at the Immortal.</p>
<p>The Immortal ignored her and continued walking forward.</p>
<p>The Gandharva was immediately enraged. She strummed the strings with her finger, and the resonating music transformed into an invisible killing intent that wrapped around the Immortal.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>There was no sword beam or sound of sword beams, but there was an invisible force that minced the music. All the strings on the lute in the Gandharva’s hand snapped at the same time.</p>
<p>The Gandharva was alarmed. It was too late to retreat. She could already sense a terrifying sword intent approaching her. Perhaps she would be beheaded in the next second.</p>
<p>As Queen of the Gandharva, she was a Calamity-grade expert after all. She never expected the other party to force her to such a disadvantageous state without even touching her.</p>
<p>A dragon’s roar resounded through the clouds. Dragon aura that resembled a waterfall cascaded down from the top of the Holy Mountain. It circled around the body of Queen of the Gandharva, as though it was colliding with some divine weapon. The dragon aura instantly shattered.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the sword intent had already vanished. The Queen of the Gandharva hurriedly retreated and distanced herself from the Immortal.</p>
<p>Apart from the monarchs of the Celestials and Dragons, the other six monarchs had already appeared and blocked the Immortal’s path as though they wanted to take him down.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of Octokind had already rushed over. They surrounded him from all directions. They held weapons in their hands and pointed them at the Immortal.</p>
<p>The tens of thousands of Octokind royalty and six Calamity-grade monarchs didn’t seem to exist in the eyes of the Immortal. He continued walking forward, his gaze fixed on a figure standing at the top of the stairs.</p>
<p>When the six monarchs saw him in such a state, they were enraged as they prepared to kill him.</p>
<p>“Let him pass.” A voice sounded from the top of the stone steps. The person standing there was none other than Wang Mingyuan, who had already become the Dragon King. He was also the one who had saved the Gandharva with his dragon aura.</p>
<p>When the six monarchs heard Wang Mingyuan’s words, they had no choice but to order their men to retreat and make way.</p>
<p>However, the tens of thousands of Octokind were eyeing them covetously from both sides. They were everywhere. If it were an ordinary person, they would probably be terrified.</p>
<p>However, the Immortal didn’t notice anything as he walked towards the top of the stone steps.</p>
<p>“Sir, why are you here?” Wang Mingyuan asked when the Immortal came close.</p>
<p>The Immortal ignored him and walked past him. His fluttering white hair brushed past Wang Mingyuan’s face.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan stood there and watched the Immortal walk into the divine temple before sitting down at the main seat.</p>
<p>It was originally the seat of the Lord of the Octokind. Even Di Tian, who had been the leader of the Octokind, wasn’t qualified to sit there. Now, Wang Mingyuan was only taking the deputy’s seat. Only the king of the Exalted which the Octokind relied on had the right to sit there.</p>
<p>Seeing that the Immortal was sitting in that spot, be it the royalty or ordinary members of the Octokind, all of them rushed into the hall to kill the Immortal, but they were stopped by Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>“Sir, what do you want?” Wang Mingyuan asked as he looked at the Immortal sitting high on the platform.</p>
<p>“From today on, the Octokind shall be sealed in the mountain for three years. No Octokind shall take half a step out. All who disobey shall be executed.” The Immortal looked down at Wang Mingyuan and continued, “In the past, Damo faced the wall for nine years and finally gained enlightenment on some principles. You don’t have to face the wall. Just stand there and reflect for three years. No matter how slow-witted you are, you should be able to understand something.”</p>
<p>“What gives you the right to dictate that?” The Yaksha King questioned. Instantly, the masses were enraged. Some of the Octokind couldn’t help but rush into the hall.</p>
<p>Just as the battle was about to begin, a blob of golden light tore through the air.</p>
<p>“Supremacy… He…” When the golden light landed, it was a Buddha with a golden glow. Yaksha King and company hurriedly went forward to bow. Before they could say anything, they were cut off by the Buddha.</p>
<p>Buddha walked in front of the Immortal and pressed his palms together. He bowed slightly and said, “Sword Immortal, please calm down. From today onwards, the Octokind will stay sealed for three years. The Dragon King will reflect on himself for three years and will not be allowed to move half a step. Do you have any other requests?</p>
<p>“A disciple of my Sword Immortal lineage can’t die for nothing. The ones who killed him have to pay with their lives.” As the man spoke, he kept looking at Wang Mingyuan.. He knew that Jiang Yan was Wang Mingyuan’s disciple.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1395'>Chapter 1395: Unhappy About It? Put Up With It</h3>
<p>“Definitely.” Buddha nodded slightly and looked at Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>The news of Perfect Sword Immortal’s downfall on Earth had spread to the higher-ups of the dimension. Although not many people knew the exact situation, most of the higher-ups knew that Perfect Sword Immortal had been tricked by Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>Buddha didn’t find it strange that someone from the Sword Immortal lineage came to settle scores with Wang Mingyuan. However, Wang Mingyuan was now considered the leader of the Octokind. It was still acceptable for him to self-reflect for three years. If he really killed Wang Mingyuan, not only would the reputation of the Octokind be ruined, but even the Exalted whom the Octokind relied on would have their reputation marred.</p>
<p>This matter was done by Wang Mingyuan’s disciple. It was the best outcome to have Wang Mingyuan answer to the Sword Immortal lineage.</p>
<p>Seeing Buddha look at him, Wang Mingyuan naturally knew what he meant.</p>
<p>“How may I address you?” Wang Mingyuan’s expression was as calm as ever. What the Immortal had said seemed to have nothing to do with him.</p>
<p>“Berserker,” the Immortal finally answered casually.</p>
<p>When he mentioned his name, the expressions of the Octokind changed drastically.</p>
<p>Few people in the dimension didn’t know the name of Berserker. He was just too infamous and was known as the number one Calamity under the Apocalypse grade.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this name wasn’t an empty one. Berserker had once killed an Apocalypse as a Calamity, shocking the entire dimension. Everyone knew about it.</p>
<p>Although Wang Mingyuan also had the strength of a Calamity-grade and had impressive combat strength, he was still much weaker than a powerful Calamity like Berserker.</p>
<p>Even most of the Octokind believed that the monarchs of the Octokind were on a completely different level from Berserker. No one treated Berserker as a Calamity-grade. Many people even treated him as an Apocalypse-grade powerhouse.</p>
<p>Previously, due to the Berserker’s insolence, the members of the Octokind were still very indignant. However, after hearing the name of Berserker, they seemed to be doused with a bucket of ice water. It chilled their hearts, and the indignation in their hearts vanished for some reason.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan didn’t show any surprise after learning Berserker’s name. He only nodded slightly before walking towards him.</p>
<p>“Did I give you permission to move?” Sword Intent surged around Berserker as it slashed at Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>As Wang Mingyuan walked, he said, “I believe your race is still determined to retrieve that immortal sword left behind on Earth during the Mythical era, right?”</p>
<p>“You know where that sword is?” The sword intent around Berserker paused as he stared at Wang Mingyuan and asked.</p>
<p>“No.” Wang Mingyuan shook his head frankly.</p>
<p>“If what you say next doesn’t satisfy me, the resolution won’t just involve three years of self-reflection,” said Berserker coldly.</p>
<p>However, Wang Mingyuan didn’t seem to hear him. As he walked towards Berserker, he said, “To retrieve that immortal sword, you need the help of humans on Earth. You don’t have any objections about that, right?”</p>
<p>“Continue,” said Berserker with a frown.</p>
<p>If they could directly descend to Earth to retrieve the immortal sword, the Immortals wouldn’t have to go through so much trouble. They wouldn’t have had to secretly nurture Jiang Yan and the League of Guardians; they could have gone to Earth to find it themselves.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan continued, “Then I’ll provide you with an analysis. Now, the factions on Earth are divided into five major factions. The first faction is the Holy Temple and the six human families. I don’t think this faction will be used by the Immortals. You know the reason better than me.”</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan had already walked into the hall, but he had no intention of stopping. He continued walking towards Berserker who was sitting on the seat of honor. As he walked, he said, “The second faction is the League of Guardians. Currently, Jiang Yan is the leader. According to what I know, his Guardian has already advanced to the Calamity grade. Furthermore, he is no longer under the Immortals’ control.”</p>
<p>“Continue.” Berserker looked at Wang Mingyuan with killing intent brewing in his eyes.</p>
<p>“The third faction is the Holy Spirit Association. The president, Ya, is also my disciple,” Wang Mingyuan said.</p>
<p>Berserker was slightly taken aback. He was unaware that Ya was actually Wang Mingyuan’s disciple. He wasn’t responsible for the matters on Earth. If his disciple, Perfect Sword Immortal, hadn’t died, Berserker wouldn’t have been involved in this matter.</p>
<p>“The fourth faction is the federal government. Compared to the first three, the current federal government is a little weaker. However, due to the appearance of the Mythical Serum, this faction has the greatest potential. Given enough time, more and more powerhouses will definitely be born to this faction in the future. It will definitely become mainstream.” As Wang Mingyuan spoke, he arrived in front of the platform of honor. He still had no intention of stopping.</p>
<p>“Hui Haifeng is your disciple. This isn’t a secret. You don’t have to flaunt it,” said Berserker.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan smiled. “The fifth faction is made up of local elites. Among them, Luoyang’s An family is the strongest. Their strength can already match the six families.”</p>
<p>“It’s true that you came from Luoyang, but your Wang family is nothing in Luoyang. Don’t tell me you want to say that An Tianzuo is also your disciple?” Berserker said coldly.</p>
<p>“No, but the number three figure in Luoyang now is Zhou Wen, who has some ties with the An family. He’s also my disciple. You should know this very well, right?” Wang Mingyuan was already standing within reach of Berserker.</p>
<p>“So what?” Berserker said contemptuously.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan’s disciples might be powerful figures on Earth, but in the eyes of Berserker, they were nothing.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for the fact that they were born on Earth and were protected by Earth, he wouldn’t even need to raise his hands to kill them.</p>
<p>“It’s not a big deal. It’s just that beyond the five factions, may I ask who else can the Immortals use to find the immortal sword?” Wang Mingyuan asked Berserker.</p>
<p>Berserker was slightly taken aback before his expression gradually changed.</p>
<p>These people were nothing in the dimension, so much so that Berserker couldn’t even be bothered to spare them a glance.</p>
<p>However, on Earth, the energy these people possessed was unimaginable.</p>
<p>Now, Earth’s situation was basically stable. There was no need to think about the Holy Temple. The Holy Temple was originally the enemy of the Immortals. If the Holy Temple hadn’t controlled Earth in the past, the Immortals wouldn’t have been in such a disadvantageous position.</p>
<p>However, that immortal sword had an extraordinary meaning to the entire Immortal race. They had to retrieve it no matter what. The Immortals had gathered resources for so long and paid a huge price to teleport so many Guardians into Earth—all done to retrieve that immortal sword.</p>
<p>In this era, Earth had undergone a large-scale aberration. The situation in which the six families ruled had been overthrown. Only then did the Immortals finally usher in an opportunity.</p>
<p>They originally imagined that they could control the League of Guardians for their own purposes, but to their surprise, they ended up being plotted against by Jiang Yan. One could only blame Perfect Sword Immortal for being stupid. He had managed to turn the fine situation into its present state.</p>
<p>Without the League of Guardians, the Immortals could only support another human faction. However, based on the distribution of the present factions, it was probably very difficult for new factions to emerge. Furthermore, the Skysplit Tower was still in the hands of the League of Guardians. Without the Skysplit Tower’s help, there weren’t many resources that the Immortals could send to Earth. It wasn’t that they lacked resources, but there was no stable channel.</p>
<p>Berserker thought carefully and realized that the Immortals had reached a point where no one could be used. The people who they could use were actually Wang Mingyuan’s disciples.</p>
<p>Even if the Immortals weren’t afraid of wasting time and effort to support a new faction, it was probably impossible for them to grow with Wang Mingyuan’s disciples and the Holy Temple around.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan had already made his hint clear—with his disciples around, it was impossible for the Immortals to retrieve the immortal sword from Earth.</p>
<p>Pa! Wang Mingyuan slapped Berserker in the face, causing his face to jerk to the side.</p>
<p>Everyone was alarmed as their eyes widened. Berserker also widened his eyes as he turned his head back and stared at Wang Mingyuan. He was like a beast that was about to devour him. The sword intent over his body stirred crazily as though it wanted to tear the world apart, but he ultimately didn’t attack Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>“Unhappy about it?” As Wang Mingyuan spoke, he slapped Berserker in the face again. With a slap, his face jerked to the other side.</p>
<p>“Put up with it,” Wang Mingyuan said casually as he looked at the enraged Berserker.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1396'>Chapter 1396: Seeking Perfection</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Berserker ultimately didn’t attack Wang Mingyuan as he tore through the air and left the Octokind.</p>
<p>Although the sword intent around him was terrifying when he returned, it no longer delivered the shock and awe from before. Instead, it made him appear to be in a sorry state. The Octokind looked at Wang Mingyuan with strange emotions.</p>
<p>Buddha seemed to acquaint himself with Wang Mingyuan for the first time as he sized him up deeply before leaving the Octokind without a word.</p>
<p>Although Berserker didn’t take action, his departure left a huge impact on the Octokind and their Buddha race. Buddha didn’t know how to deal with it, so he could only choose to do nothing and rush back to report the matter to the Buddha race.</p>
<p>In an ancient temple, the Buddha reported the matter to an ancient Buddha.</p>
<p>The ancient Buddha’s eyebrows were connected and drooped all the way to the ground. His skin was wrinkled like tree bark and his body was covered in dust. He looked like a clay statue as he sat there.</p>
<p>After hearing what had happened, the ancient Buddha finally opened his eyes. The eyes weren’t like an elder’s eyes. They were bright and deep, as though billions of grains of sand were flowing in them.</p>
<p>His entire body was ancient and deathly still. Only his eyes were filled with vitality, making him look like a youth.</p>
<p>“Supreme One, for Berserker to be able to tolerate this and not kill Wang Mingyuan on the spot, there should still be room for negotiation, right?” the Buddha asked with a bow.</p>
<p>However, the ancient Buddha said indifferently, “It’s not that he doesn’t want to kill, but he doesn’t know if he can.”</p>
<p>The Buddha was taken aback, unsure what the ancient Buddha meant. If Berserker wanted to kill someone, there was no one beneath the Apocalypse grade that he couldn’t kill.</p>
<p>The ancient Buddha continued, “Berserker is known as the number one Calamity under the Apocalypse grade. It’s definitely not a lie. Do you think an ordinary Calamity can slap his face just like that? Even if he was momentarily distracted, how could he be slapped a second time?”</p>
<p>Only then did Buddha come to a realization as he said in surprise, “Supreme One, you mean that Wang Mingyuan is stronger than Berserker?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Berserker might not know either. Furthermore, Wang Mingyuan is right. There are only so many humans on Earth who can be used, so Berserker didn’t take action,” said the ancient Buddha.</p>
<p>However, the more the Buddha thought about it, the more alarmed he became. “Apart from the Holy Temple and the six families, the factions that can be used are basically under the control of Wang Mingyuan’s disciples. Did he do it intentionally? If he did, isn’t this too terrifying? The Holy Temple has been plotting for so long, but they ultimately failed to control the situation. Wang Mingyuan only used a few disciples… If it’s unintentional, is that possible?”</p>
<p>“Regardless of whether it was intentional or not, this person will play a decisive role in the future competition for Earth. He can’t be underestimated,” said the ancient Buddha.</p>
<p>“Now that he is a subsidiary of our race, can we…” the Buddha said with suppressed excitement.</p>
<p>“Fortune and disaster are two sides of the same coin. Why bother yourself? Go.” As the ancient Buddha spoke, he slowly closed his eyes and returned to his clay statue-like appearance.</p>
<p>The Buddha looked at the ancient Buddha in a daze before bowing and leaving.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in a good mood. He had already attempted pet fusion several times.</p>
<p>As he was afraid of failure, Zhou Wen used Companion Eggs as supplementary fusion materials every time. Such fusion only allowed him to fuse the skills without changing Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they were all combinations of species with higher success rates. They ensured that Tyrant Behemoth wouldn’t be damaged because of failure.</p>
<p>However, no matter how he tried, Zhou Wen failed to obtain the skills he wanted.</p>
<p>Every time one skill was added, the next skill added would erase the previous skill.</p>
<p>Through repeated fusions, one skill or the other would vanish. It nearly drove Zhou Wen crazy.</p>
<p>He tried the Bloodline function again which allowed Tyrant Behemoth to have a second Life Providence, but he failed many times as well. Thankfully, the Bloodline function only expended supplementary materials and didn’t harm the main pet.</p>
<p>After repeated failures, Zhou Wen had the urge to fuse Deva Asura and Tyrant Behemoth together.</p>
<p>Deva Asura’s offensive strength was very strong, but it was still much weaker than Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength. However, Deva Asura’s lucky critical strike was very useful. It wasn’t bad to be able to fuse it.</p>
<p>However, with so many failures, Zhou Wen didn’t dare take the risk. Furthermore, it wasn’t of much use.</p>
<p>He had to farm for Companion Eggs while fusing. If he couldn’t obtain suitable Companion Eggs, he wouldn’t even have the chance to fuse them.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen had given Tyrant Behemoth five skills from all his attempts—Armor Breaker, Penetration, Ripping, Unstoppable, and God of Combat Blessing. Previously, it had Ever-Victorious, but it was wiped out when he was trying for Unstoppable.</p>
<p>Up to now, he still hadn’t been able to have Ever-Victorious and Unstoppable together. He either lacked this or that.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen had already spent money to buy quite a number of Companion Eggs for fusion. He didn’t know how long it would take for him to obtain one from farming.</p>
<p>This is the last Companion Egg with Ever-Victorious. Zhou Wen looked at the Companion Egg in his hand and hesitated about fusing it.</p>
<p>To be honest, the five skills were already very good. They basically boosted Tyrant Behemoth’s offensive strength, but without Ever-Victorious, Zhou Wen found it a little incomplete.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had bought all the Companion Eggs he could. He wasn’t afraid of spending money, but now, he couldn’t buy them even if he had the money.</p>
<p>Life is about completion and being at ease. I’ll fuse them. Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and slotted in the last Companion Egg with Ever-Victorious.</p>
<p>Amidst the light, the Companion Egg fused with Tyrant Behemoth, shimmering with a successful fusion glow.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was uneasy as he glanced at Tyrant Behemoth that had completed its fusion. He immediately felt a chill run down his spine.</p>
<p>Not only did it fail to fuse Ever-Victorious, but it also wiped out Unstoppable and God of Combat’s Blessing. Apart from Armor Breaker, Penetration, and Ripping, a Poison Fang skill was fused.</p>
<p>My Tyrant Behemoth isn’t a poison-type creature. What’s the point of fusing Poison Fang? Return my Unstoppable! Zhou Wen wanted to cry.</p>
<p>Now, there were no more Unstoppable or Ever-Victorious Companion Eggs. It was over.</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng, is there anyone else selling Overlord Snake Companion Eggs?” Zhou Wen had no choice but to ask An Sheng.</p>
<p>“Young Master, the Overlord Snakes that can be used and bought have all been bought by me. The Overlord Snakes in Dragon Gate Grotto have all been cleaned out. The price of Overlord Snake Companion Eggs has doubled, yet there are none for sale,” An Sheng answered helplessly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen asked about the few more Companion Beasts he needed, but the answer was the same. They couldn’t be bought.</p>
<p>What should I do? Zhou Wen was extremely depressed. If he had known this would happen, he wouldn’t have gone with the fusion. At the very least, there was Unstoppable. The augmentation of the God of Combat’s Blessing wasn’t bad either. It augmented his surroundings pretty well.</p>
<p>Sweetie watched Zhou Wen from the side the entire time, having been by his side all this while. However, she didn’t let him see her. This was because she hadn’t been able to help him when he was in danger, so she was somewhat embarrassed to appear in front of him again.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen’s depressed look, Sweetie seemed to come to a decision.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1397'>Chapter 1397: A Piece of Candy</h3>
<p>1</p>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Although he’s a baddie… Mother said that everyone is equal in front of God… He should have the right to be saved… Sweetie muttered to herself as though she was convincing herself.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was extremely displeased that his fusion hadn’t succeeded. Putting away his phone, he wanted to take a breather, so he entered the garden.</p>
<p>Sitting on the bench, he summoned Banana Fairy, Demonic Neonate, and other Companion Beasts. He got Banana Fairy to fan him. Evil Spirit King massaged his legs while the other Companion Beasts came out to take a breather.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate held the Demonic Sword and stood motionless by the side. Those who didn’t know better would think that she was a wax statue.</p>
<p>I can only put the matter of fusing skills for Tyrant Behemoth aside for now. I’ll think about it when I obtain the Companion Eggs. Since I can’t do anything here, I can only head to Venus to kill the Calamity-grade creature who fires the bullets. If I can kill him, I might be able to have a Calamity-grade gun drop. Then, all my problems will be resolved. Zhou Wen’s infinite looping space had basically taken form. He was just short of the final test in combat. He still needed to experiment to see if he could trap the Calamity-grade bullet in the infinite looping space.</p>
<p>The Venusian instance dungeon hadn’t refreshed. He could only wait until tomorrow to experiment.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen leaned against the bench and closed his eyes to relax, allowing himself to escape the depressing feelings of failure.</p>
<p>At that moment, Sweetie stood not far from him. She was sizing up the Companion Beasts Zhou Wen had summoned. She held a piece of candy in her hand.</p>
<p>Seeing how pitiful he is, I’ll give him a piece of candy. This is to return him the plum blossom cake that he treated me to. I’ll still avenge Yana… Sweetie muttered as she sized up Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>The first thing Sweetie saw was Demonic Neonate. However, a sense of disgust immediately arose in her heart when she saw Demonic Neonate, as though it was innate hate.</p>
<p>Soon, Sweetie rejected Demonic Neonate and looked at Banana Fairy.</p>
<p>Sweetie’s gaze landed on Banana Fairy’s chest before she looked at her flat chest. She then gave up on Banana Fairy and looked at the other Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>She didn’t like Evil Spirit King either. The other Companion Beasts seemed to have their own problems.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had quite a number of Companion Beasts. Although he hadn’t completely summoned them, there were more than ten outside. Sweetie swept her gaze and hesitated for a moment before walking towards the Soul Mirror that Zhou Wen had placed to the side.</p>
<p>Sweetie silently came in front of the Soul Mirror. Although the Soul Mirror was on the bench and was extremely close to Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen didn’t discover her when she came in front of the mirror.</p>
<p>Even the Soul Mirror failed to reflect Sweetie’s figure.</p>
<p>It’s just a mirror. It shouldn’t be lethal, right? I’ll just give him some life-preservation abilities. They won’t be used to harm others, Sweetie muttered as she peeled the wrapper from the candy in her hand and placed it on the mirror.</p>
<p>When the milk candy touched the mirror, it immediately melted and strangely flowed into the mirror.</p>
<p>At that moment, a faint shadow appeared in the mirror. The shadow swallowed the milk candy in one mouthful.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was comfortably sunbathing when he suddenly sensed the unnatural vibrations of the Soul Mirror. He opened his eyes and realized that the Soul Mirror had undergone a tremendous change.</p>
<p>At that moment, the Soul Mirror had already turned jade-white. The mirror’s surface also turned crystalline. It was clearly a smooth mirror, but it appeared to have many angles as though it was the cut surfaces of a diamond.</p>
<p>That wasn’t all. The Soul Mirror kept changing. The jade layer on the surface gradually melted into milky-white liquid that dripped.</p>
<p>Every drop of liquid reduced the jade color of the Soul Mirror, making it even more crystalline and transparent.</p>
<p>Why is this happening? Zhou Wen watched as the Soul Mirror constantly evolved. He was alarmed and puzzled because in a short period of time, the Mortal Soul Mirror had already advanced to the Epic stage and was constantly evolving.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t remember giving the Soul Mirror anything good. In fact, the Soul Mirror didn’t eat anything. It could only absorb some Essence Energy dimensional crystals, but it didn’t absorb much.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted the Soul Mirror to evolve, but he never expected it to evolve on its own.</p>
<p>Could it be that the Soul Mirror’s evolution is triggered by basking in the sun? Zhou Wen looked at the sun in the sky. Apart from this, he really couldn’t figure out why the Soul Mirror would evolve so quickly.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was thinking, the Soul Mirror advanced again and reached the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that he could see a faintly discernible figure in the mirror. It seemed to be the shadow of a woman. He couldn’t see her facial features clearly, but he could see her figure and clothes. She looked very beautiful.</p>
<p>Why is it still evolving! Zhou Wen’s expression turned odd when he saw that the Soul Mirror was still evolving.</p>
<p>Now, even a fool knew that the Soul Mirror’s evolution trigger wasn’t as simple as basking in the sun. Something must have happened to evolve it.</p>
<p>What happened? Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to pay attention to his surroundings. After advancing to the Terror grade, he had adapted to Truth Listener’s ability and could hear all sorts of sounds he wanted to hear.</p>
<p>However, after listening for a while, he didn’t discover anything. It was as though the Soul Mirror could evolve just by sunbathing.</p>
<p>Looking at Zhou Wen’s surprised expression, Sweetie felt a little smug. Isn’t it too early to be surprised? What would you do next?</p>
<p>As the Soul Mirror turned crystalline, the figure in the mirror became clearer. It looked like a woman in a white muslin dress. From her appearance, she looked a little like a fairy.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, Zhou Wen felt that the figure seemed a little ghostly. It wasn’t as elegant and ethereal as a true fairy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t just shocked because he felt that the Soul Mirror was about to break through to the Terror grade.</p>
<p>No way. It’s about to advance to the Terror grade? Zhou Wen was somewhat dumbfounded. He originally imagined that it was An Sheng’s doing.</p>
<p>Now, it couldn’t be An Sheng. No matter how capable An Sheng was, it was impossible for him to obtain something so good and directly advance the Mortal Soul Mirror to the Terror grade.</p>
<p>If there was really such a good item, he should have given it to An Tianzuo first. It was impossible for An Sheng to prioritize him.</p>
<p>Why isn’t An Tianzuo back yet? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but grumble when he thought of An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>He had no intention of guarding An Tianzuo’s home for long. There were many things waiting for him to do. Luoyang was too small for him.</p>
<p>As expected, the Soul Mirror advanced to the Terror grade. Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised when he saw it emit a strange light like glass.</p>
<p>He was delighted that the Soul Mirror had directly advanced to the Terror grade, reducing the trouble of him feeding it. However, he was alarmed that the Soul Mirror continued advancing without any signs of stopping its evolution.</p>
<p>No way… Could it really be advancing to the Calamity grade? Zhou Wen was alarmed and afraid.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1398'>Chapter 1398: Evolving to the Calamity Grade</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that ordinary creatures needed to trigger a Calamity when advancing to the Calamity grade. He just didn’t know if such a situation would happen when a Companion Beast advanced to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Regardless, Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to take the risk. He stored the Soul Mirror into the chaos space.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sank his consciousness into the chaos space and continued observing the changes in the Soul Mirror.</p>
<p>If the Soul Mirror can really advance to the Calamity grade, what kind of ability will it have? Can the Calamity-grade Soul-Washing Divine Light directly turn a Calamity-grade creature into an idiot? Many thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind.</p>
<p>The Soul Mirror became more and more transparent, but the woman’s figure wasn’t completely revealed. She remained blurry and indiscernible despite being visible.</p>
<p>Not long after, the Soul Mirror’s mirror was about to turn transparent. Zhou Wen was worried that he wouldn’t be able to see it when it subsequently turned invisible. What if he accidentally shone it onto himself?</p>
<p>Suddenly!</p>
<p>Rainbow beams of light spewed out from the Soul Mirror, instantly melting a large area of the chaos fog in the chaos space. Zhou Wen felt a pain in his consciousness and couldn’t help but be alarmed as he hurriedly retracted his consciousness.</p>
<p>Even so, he still felt dizzy and his mind went blank for a moment. His consciousness had suffered quite a bit of damage. If he had retreated any later, his consciousness might have been completely destroyed. He would probably have become an idiot.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I put away the Soul Mirror. Otherwise, based on the range of the rainbow beam, the An family would definitely have been wiped out, even if it didn’t affect Luoyang. Zhou Wen felt a lingering fear when he thought about it.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t have a good impression of An Tianzuo, it would be too much to destroy the An family. Furthermore, his father, Ouyang Lan, An Sheng, and company were all here.</p>
<p>In the future, when Companion Beasts advance to the Calamity grade, I have to place them in the chaos space. Zhou Wen didn’t know when the Soul Mirror would finish its evolution, nor did he dare spy on the situation in the chaos space. All he could do was temporarily wait.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully recalled the entire process of the Soul Mirror’s advancement. Before he could figure out why it had suddenly advanced to the Calamity grade, he saw An Sheng walk into the garden.</p>
<p>“Young Master, someone has entered the Venusian dimensional zone again,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Who is it?” Zhou Wen looked at An Sheng’s expression and knew that the person was likely someone he knew.</p>
<p>“Immortal of the League of Guardians,” An Sheng answered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hadn’t told anyone that Jiang Yan was Immortal, so An Sheng didn’t know that Immortal was Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>However, even if he knew, the animosity between Jiang Yan and the An family wouldn’t change much. This was because Zhou Wen already knew that Jiang Yan was Cave Era’s younger brother, and both Cave Era and Uesugi Nao came from overseas. Jiang Yan was likely from overseas as well which made him an enemy of the Federation.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan’s previous attendance at Sunset College was probably not just for studying. It was very likely that he was a spy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and An Sheng went to the Cube to watch Jiang Yan attempt again.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen arrived at the Cube, Jiang Yan had already entered the Venusian dimensional zone. Furthermore, he had killed all the Metal Guards. The first Golden Battle God was about to come out.</p>
<p>The last time someone from the League of Guardians challenged the level, Jiang Yan didn’t come personally. This time, only Jiang Yan came.</p>
<p>After the Golden Battle God came out, he attacked Jiang Yan. Frost bullets shot at him like streams of light.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan was still wearing the Skyimmortal armor. Fairy Burial was not seen.</p>
<p>However, just the Skyimmortal armor was rather terrifying. When the freezing bullets struck the Skyimmortal armor, they exploded into an icy mist, but they failed to injure it at all.</p>
<p>As expected of a Calamity-grade Guardian. Zhou Wen was secretly envious.</p>
<p>An Sheng had obtained five Golden Battle God Companion Beasts from Zhou Wen, so he naturally knew how powerful the Golden Battle God was. Seeing that the Frost Bullets couldn’t injure Immortal, he was immediately alarmed. “Calamity-grade? Immortal’s Guardian has actually advanced to the Calamity grade!”</p>
<p>“Is there a need to be so surprised? The League of Guardians took so many dimensional resources. Isn’t it normal to advance to the Calamity grade?” Zhou Wen said guiltily. He didn’t dare say that Jiang Yan had advanced to the Calamity grade because of him.</p>
<p>An Sheng suddenly turned to look at Zhou Wen and sized him up.</p>
<p>“Why are you looking at me?” Zhou Wen forced himself to calm down.</p>
<p>“Young Master, didn’t you make a trip to the League of Guardians previously? I didn’t hear you mention that Immortal is at the Calamity grade,” An Sheng said as he stared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“That isn’t something honorable for me to profess. What’s there to say?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That’s not right. It doesn’t seem like you, Young Master. When you saw that Immortal was at the Calamity grade, your emotions didn’t change at all. You should have known long ago. It’s obvious that you saw him in the League of Guardians. To be able to see the Calamity-grade Immortal and return in one piece, as well as him not coming to Luoyang to cause trouble, there’s a huge problem in all of this,” An Sheng said slowly as he stared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What problem can there be?” Zhou Wen pretended not to care.</p>
<p>An Sheng seemed to see through Zhou Wen’s thoughts as he revealed a strange smile. “Young Master, with your temper, if there’s danger, you will definitely give a warning. However, you didn’t mention anything about Immortal being a Calamity-grade when you returned. This means that you don’t think it’s a threat. However, how can a Calamity-grade Immortal not be a threat? I believe there are only two possibilities. One is that your strength has already exceeded the Calamity-grade Immortal. Immortal isn’t your match, so he naturally wouldn’t dare come to Luoyang to cause trouble. There’s no need to give the warning. Another possibility is that you know Immortal and are aware that Immortal won’t attack you or Luoyang, so you didn’t say anything.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at An Sheng with an ambivalent expression as he thought to himself, Can An Sheng read minds? How did he guess it right?</p>
<p>An Sheng continued, “Young Master, you are relatively cautious. Even if you have the ability to defeat Immortal, you should have given me the warning. I think the latter is more likely.</p>
<p>“Young Master, are you really very familiar with Immortal? Can you tell me who he is?” An Sheng seemed to have turned his doubts into affirmation as he pressed on.</p>
<p>“Since you are so good at guessing, guess it yourself,” Zhou Wen said expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“I’m stumped. Young Master, you are still the best. You have a wide social circle.” An Sheng lowered his head.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen heard An Sheng’s words, he knew that An Sheng had most likely guessed it. This was because Zhou Wen didn’t have a wide social circle. He only knew a few people, so it wasn’t difficult to work it out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pretended not to hear him as he continued watching Jiang Yan clear the level.</p>
<p>The Golden Battle God was blasted apart by Immortal with a wave of his hand. The Golden Battle Gods that appeared next were the same. They couldn’t injure Immortal at all as they were all destroyed with a wave of his hand.</p>
<p>None of this was surprising. What Zhou Wen really wanted to know was how Jiang Yan planned on dealing with the sure-kill seventh bullet.</p>
<p>Does he want to rush to the Golden Palace before the seventh bullet? As Zhou Wen was pondering, Immortal had already walked into the opened tunnel.</p>
<p>His speed didn’t seem fast. Every step he took made him look like a normal person walking, but with every step he took, his figure had already traveled extreme distances. His speed was even faster than ordinary Terror-grade creatures running at full speed.</p>
<p>The first shot finally sounded. When their eyes focused, people realized that Immortal had a bullet between his fingers. He had actually used his fingers to clamp down on the Calamity-grade attack.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1399'>Chapter 1399: The Person Who Gives A Friendly Nudge</h3>
<p>Gunshots constantly sounded. Six consecutive shots were caught by Immortal’s fingers. Furthermore, they were unable to stop him from advancing.</p>
<p>Others might think that Immortal’s Guardian was extremely powerful, but Zhou Wen knew that this fellow still had Fairy Burial hidden within. In fact, it was the power of two Guardians. Furthermore, it was two Calamity-grade creatures, so it was naturally not something ordinary Calamity-grade creatures could compare with.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen still wanted to know how Jiang Yan was going to deal with the sure-kill seventh bullet.</p>
<p>The seventh bullet wasn’t something that could be blocked with strength. Unless Jiang Yan’s strength had exceeded the Calamity grade, it was impossible.</p>
<p>The people from the other factions were also paying attention to Immortal.</p>
<p>Many people were alarmed, especially the factions that had once been enemies of the League of Guardians. They yearned for Immortal to die in the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>After all, the various factions didn’t have Calamity-grade combat strength. A Calamity-grade like Immortal was like a nuclear bomb. Who wouldn’t be afraid?</p>
<p>In the Venusian dimensional zone, before the Calamity could deliver the fatal seventh shot, Jiang Yan had already arrived in front of the Golden Palace. All he needed to do was take a step onto the steps to successfully clear the dungeon.</p>
<p>However, Jiang Yan didn’t do so. Instead, he stopped in front of the stairs. It was obvious that he was waiting for the sure-kill seventh shot.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The seventh shot finally sounded. Everyone widened their eyes as they stared intently at Jiang Yan, wanting to see how he would deal with it.</p>
<p>When everyone saw the seventh bullet, it had already hit Jiang Yan’s palm. The Skyimmortal armor failed to completely block it.</p>
<p>The bullet tore forward crazily like a drill. Sparks and lightning drilled through the Skyimmortal armor as it continued, almost piercing through Jiang Yan’s palm.</p>
<p>However, Jiang Yan closed his fingers the next second and grabbed the bullet. Sparks flew out between his fingers, but the bullet failed to escape.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan held the bullet and walked up the stairs, opening the Golden Palace door as a metal ball flew out.</p>
<p>The scene switched back to the rankings. Everyone stared at the rankings, wanting to know what rank Immortal would receive.</p>
<p>From Immortal’s performance, his ranking was definitely not low. He had grabbed the Calamity-grade bullet with his bare hands, and it was the sure-kill seventh bullet. Previously, even the Dragon Turtle’s defense couldn’t withstand it, but Immortal had done it.</p>
<p>Others might not know, but Zhou Wen knew that the Skyimmortal hadn’t been able to block the fatal seventh bullet. Jiang Yan had still used Fairy Burial, so the bullet was probably resisting its power.</p>
<p>From the final scene, Fairy Burial wasn’t able to completely suppress the bullet either.</p>
<p>“Five stars… It’s five stars…” someone exclaimed.</p>
<p>Immortal’s name appeared on the rankings, followed by five shiny golden stars. Furthermore, despite both being five stars, Immortal’s name was higher than Tsukuyomi’s, putting him first on the rankings.</p>
<p>This ranking made many people feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>After all, many factions were secretly competing with the League of Guardians. From their point of view, the League of Guardians was just a lackey of the dimension. Immortal had advanced to the Calamity grade and obtained first on the rankings. It was a greater blow to the average person than Tsukuyomi getting first.</p>
<p>It was especially so for humans who had worked hard and even risked their lives to use the Mythical Serum or Spirit Casting. At that moment, their hearts felt as though a boulder was pressing down on them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t concerned. After the last battle, he realized that Guardians weren’t necessarily all tools of the dimension.</p>
<p>Just like the Guardians of Cave Era and Jiang Yan, although they were created in the dimension, they were born on Earth. They had independent thoughts, and the dimension couldn’t completely control them.</p>
<p>Thinking back to a Guardian like Drought Demon Fairy, it wasn’t that easy for the dimension to control her either.</p>
<p>Of course, although Zhou Wen’s view of Guardians had changed, that didn’t mean that he wanted to contract them.</p>
<p>He had been used to being alone since he was young. Companion Beasts like Demonic Neonate and Banana Fairy had already been considered a part of him, so he didn’t feel an aversion towards them.</p>
<p>However, Guardians were independent entities. Zhou Wen wasn’t used to having such an existence inseparable from him, afraid that his secrets would be exposed.</p>
<p>After this battle, the reputation of the League of Guardians was pushed to its peak again. Many youths from the new generation had thoughts of contracting a Guardian.</p>
<p>Compared to the other paths to the Mythical stage, contracting a Guardian was undoubtedly the easiest and fastest way to increase one’s strength.</p>
<p>“Young Master, do you plan on obtaining the Venusian Companion Beast?” An Sheng suddenly asked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that An Sheng’s expression was extremely solemn when he spoke. It was rare to see him speak in such a manner, so he asked, “I did, but I don’t know if it will succeed.”</p>
<p>“If it’s possible, let’s take first place now,” An Sheng said seriously.</p>
<p>“Why now?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Because humans need confidence. Humans nowadays lack confidence.” An Sheng’s expression was solemn as he continued, “In this era, most humans are at a fork in the road where they are at a loss. At this moment, someone needs to step forward to give them a nudge, but the person who steps forward might nudge them to a different path. Now that Immortal has stepped forward, he has nudged many. It might even affect the future choices of an entire generation.”</p>
<p>“That might not be a wrong path,” Zhou Wen said after some thought. He didn’t believe that contracting a Guardian was definitely the wrong path.</p>
<p>An Sheng nodded and sighed. “It’s true that it might not be the wrong path, but at the very least, we have to let the next generation see that there are other paths to take, not just one. The path might be a good one, but with more people taking it, it will become the sole path.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen lowered his head and pondered over An Sheng’s words. After a while, he looked up and said, “Then let me open up a new path.”</p>
<p>“Young Master, go break a leg!” An Sheng’s expression changed instantly when he received Zhou Wen’s affirmative answer. He looked like a fanatic who was rooting for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at An Sheng and was at a loss whether to laugh or cry. He suddenly understood An Tianzuo. An Tianzuo was clearly very satisfied with An Sheng’s capabilities, but he still kept lecturing him.</p>
<p>An Sheng was a person who didn’t let others live in peace. Sometimes, Zhou Wen had the urge to strangle him to death.</p>
<p>“However, I can only give it a try. It’s hard to say what rank I’ll get. Furthermore, I still need some time to prepare.” Zhou Wen didn’t know what rank he would get if he tried his best.</p>
<p>If he wanted to maximize the chances of getting first place, it was best if he waited for the Soul Mirror to complete its evolution. Furthermore, Zhou Wen still had one final step to complete the skill he had created.</p>
<p>Since he wanted to do it, he had to do it big.</p>
<p>“If Young Master needs anything, the Sunset Army will definitely provide you maximum support,” An Sheng said solemnly.</p>
<p>“If you really want to support me, help me get some Companion Eggs. You have the list,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>An Sheng’s expression immediately turned bitter. “Young Master, I’ve already tried all means. There really aren’t any.”</p>
