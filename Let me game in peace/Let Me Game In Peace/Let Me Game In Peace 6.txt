<h3 id='chapter500'>Chapter 500 Golden Harp</h3>
<p>The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon was actually unable to gain the upper hand despite clashing with sound waves head-on. It was forced back by the sound waves again and again, unable to charge forward.</p>
<p>However, those sound waves were unable to harm the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. They could only temporarily hold it back.</p>
<p>Every time the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon launched an attack, a portion of the Musical Note Sprites would be quaked to death. As the number of Musical Note Sprites decreased, the sound wave also weakened.</p>
<p>It was only a matter of time before the harp and the Musical Note Sprites were defeated.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t think the Golden Harp was useless because of this. After all, the Musical Note Sprites that it had gathered were only at the Legendary stage. If a large number of Epic-level Musical Note Sprites could enter its ranks, the sound waves produced wouldn’t be that simple. As long as sufficiently strong ones were included, it might be possible to defeat a Mythical creature.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to wait for the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon to defeat it. He secretly summoned Demonic Neonate and she found an opportunity to secretly release her flying sword.</p>
<p>The flying sword flew through the air during the gap in the sound waves, slicing the Golden Harp in half. After all, it was only at the Epic stage. Without the resonance power of the musical notes, it was unable to block Demonic Neonate’s flying sword.</p>
<p>‘Killed Epic creature, Golden Harp. Discovered Companion Egg.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted. He never expected his luck to be so good today. A Companion Egg dropped in his first try.</p>
<p>After losing the conformity provided by the Golden Harp, the hundreds of thousands of Musical Note Sprites were reduced to a leaderless mob. They were no longer able to fight the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon charged forward and killed large numbers of Musical Note Sprites amid the raging demonic flames. Many crystals and Companion Eggs dropped.</p>
<p>Due to the massive numbers killed, even if the drop rate wasn’t high, many Companion Eggs would drop.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar and picked up the Companion Eggs of the Golden Harp and the ordinary Musical Note Sprites, choosing to hatch them.</p>
<p>In a short while, Zhou Wen hatched more than a hundred Musical Note Sprites. Seven tiny musical symbols appeared on his left arm. Each of the music symbols had a saturated color.</p>
<p>The same Companion Beast would have a tattoo in the same spot. It would overlap, and the more there were, the more saturated the color of the tattoo.</p>
<p>The stats of the Musical Note Sprites were mostly the same. All of them only had sound wave techniques, so there wasn’t much of a difference. Therefore, Zhou Wen didn’t look at them carefully and focused on the stats of the Golden Harp.</p>
<p>Golden Harp: Epic</p>
<p>Life Providence: Symphony of Fate</p>
<p>Life Soul: Spirit of Music</p>
<p>Strength: 32</p>
<p>Speed: 39</p>
<p>Constitution: 31</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 40</p>
<p>Talent Skill: First Movement of the Symphony of Fate.</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be delighted when he read the various information regarding the Golden Harp. Its ability wasn’t as simple as just coordinating the Musical Note Sprites. As long as it was a music-type power, it could add it to the fray.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen could obtain a large number of high-level music-type creatures, Epic or even Mythical creatures, in the future, and then combine them with the power of the Golden Harp, the amount of power he could unleash was unimaginable.</p>
<p>From this point of view, although the Golden Harp was only at the Epic stage, its value was probably higher than some Mythical creatures.</p>
<p>Of course, the premise was that Zhou Wen had enough music-type Companion Beasts to work with the Golden Harp. Otherwise, its strength alone was considered at the bottom of the Epic creatures. After all, the Golden Harp’s attack wasn’t strong. It could even be said to be very weak.</p>
<p>After obtaining the Golden Harp, Zhou Wen was in a good mood. He got the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon to continue killing the Musical Note Sprites. Now, he wasn’t in a hurry to find the Sun Beast. Hundreds of thousands of Musical Note Sprites on the square were wantonly killed by the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. Zhou Wen followed behind to pick up the spoils.</p>
<p>After the musical fountain square was cleared, Zhou Wen obtained a total of more than two hundred Musical Note Sprites. The pitiful baby tiger had been killed when the Golden Harp unleashed its might. Otherwise, there would have been more.</p>
<p>There’s no hurry. There’s plenty of time to grind in the future. Sooner or later, I’ll be able to form an army. Without discovering the Sun Beast, Zhou Wen led the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon forward and entered the temple behind the square.</p>
<p>The moment he entered the temple, he saw a blob of light appear in the innermost hall. When the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon and the blood-colored avatar were seen, the blob of light that resembled a miniature sun immediately shot out a beam of light.</p>
<p>The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon didn’t hesitate to spit out a mouthful of demonic flames. When the light met the demonic flames, it didn’t shatter. Instead, it was reflected away by the demonic flames. Rays of light shone on the walls and pillars of the palace, causing green smoke to appear from the spot that was illuminated.</p>
<p>The demonic flames parted the beam and burned the Sun Beast’s body. Zhou Wen didn’t even see what the Sun Beast looked like before it was killed.</p>
<p>‘Killed Epic creature, Sun Beast. Discovered Dimensional Crystal.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked over and realized that it was only a 34-valued Strength Crystal. It was completely useless.</p>
<p>There were no other Sun Beasts or dimensional creatures in the temple. Zhou Wen circled around and left the temple before heading to the other buildings near musical fountain square.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he had found some other Musical Note Sprites and an Epic-ranked musical frog. It was able to emit sound waves and was extremely fast, but it was still easily dispatched by the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon.</p>
<p>After circling the buildings, apart from the Music Holy Temple which he hadn’t dared enter, Zhou Wen had nearly cleared the entire Music Temple. He didn’t find the Golden Harp or Sun Beast again.</p>
<p>Helpless, Zhou Wen had no choice but to leave the Music Temple dungeon and head to the Metalwork Temple to grind. He was rather lucky to obtain a Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior Companion Egg which he immediately hatched.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was still thinking of a way to obtain an armor-type Companion Beast.</p>
<p>The Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior and the Golden Warrior had a compatibility score of more than 70. The success rate was very high, so Zhou Wen wasn’t that unlucky the second time he fused them.</p>
<p>With the Legendary Golden Warrior as the main pet and the Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior as supplementary, he combined it into an Epic Golden Warrior.</p>
<p>Golden Warrior: Epic</p>
<p>Life Providence: Golden Evasion</p>
<p>Life Soul: Blessed Combat Runes</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was overjoyed when he saw the Life Providence and Life Soul. It was perfect—exactly what he wanted.</p>
<p>However, after looking at his stats, Zhou Wen frowned again. The stats of the Epic Golden Warrior were too low—27, 32, 29, 34. Its skills weren’t ideal either. It only had the Golden Bell and the Fist of War.</p>
<p>What should I use to fuse it again? Zhou Wen thought. The best fusion solution was naturally to obtain the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior’s Invulnerable Golden Body skill. This way, it could increase his stats and also possess a good skill.</p>
<p>With the Golden Bell and Invulnerable Golden Body, its defense could be improved.</p>
<p>The only problem was that the drop rate of the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior Companion Egg was similarly low.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been grinding dungeons recently. Every time he entered Music Temple, he would only encounter one Sun Beast. He also grinded the Metalwork Temple for Three-Eyed Golden Warriors.</p>
<p>As for the Golden Harp, he had not seen it since the first time.</p>
<h3 id='chapter501'>Chapter 501 Peony Garden</h3>
<p>In the huge Music Temple, only one Sun Beast would spawn every time. This made it much more difficult for Zhou Wen to obtain a Sun Beast Companion Egg. He had no choice but to sacrifice his blood to grind for one.</p>
<p>Thankfully, other than the Sun Beast, Zhou Wen could also farm rare dimensional creatures such as the baby tiger, the Elegant Emperor’s Avatar Puppet, the Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior, the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior, Mutated Overlord Snake, and so on.</p>
<p>Some Companion Beasts’ levels weren’t high, but their skills or Life Providences were very useful. If he farmed a few more, he might be able to use them when they were fused in the future.</p>
<p>While grinding for pets, Zhou Wen found a good place.</p>
<p>The place Zhou Wen found wasn’t in Sunset College, but a dimensional zone in Luoyang. It wasn’t very famous, and ordinary people seldom went there because there weren’t many dimensional creatures there. Furthermore, the drop rate was low, making it a chore.</p>
<p>Most people weren’t willing to go, but Zhou Wen felt that it was a good place. The dimensional zone that he had specially applied to go to was Peony Garden.</p>
<p>There was a legend in the region that the first empress of the East District had once ordered a hundred flowers to bloom after she got drunk in Chang’an to cheer her up.</p>
<p>The blooming season was different for a hundred flowers. However, due to the empress’s might, they had no choice but to bloom at the same time. The empress was elated to see this. However, she realized that amongst the hundred flowers, there was a flower that had yet to bloom. It was still standing amidst the hundred flowers with withered leaves. It was a peony.</p>
<p>The empress was furious and demoted the peony to Luoyang. However, who knew that the moment the peony reached Luoyang, it immediately bloomed with a beautiful rosy red color.</p>
<p>The empress got even more furious when she heard of this. She ordered for the peonies to be burnt. To everyone’s surprise, the peonies became even more beautiful amidst the flames.</p>
<p>It was said that this peony garden was the place where the empress demoted the peony.</p>
<p>Of course, that was only a legend. No matter how powerful the empress of the human world was, she couldn’t dictate the blooming of flowers. Therefore, it was still a mystery why Peony Garden could become a dimensional zone.</p>
<p>The peony flowers in the peony garden were dimensional creatures. In the past, there were people who wantonly reaped them. Unfortunately, peony flowers didn’t drop dimensional crystals or Companion Eggs. Eventually, no one came here to cut peonies.</p>
<p>There were two types of dimensional creatures that could be killed in the Peony Garden. One of them was a bee-type dimensional creature, while the other was a butterfly-type. However, there weren’t many of them, so it was rather troublesome to find them. They were all poisonous and didn’t drop any good items. Therefore, Peony Garden gradually lost its importance.</p>
<p>The reason Zhou Wen came to peony garden wasn’t to kill the bees and butterflies. It was because there were very few people here. Furthermore, it was said that there was an immortal root in Peony Garden that was the closest to nature.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only wanted to come here to game. While gaming, he could also sense the flora and fauna. It could be considered a form of intimacy with nature. Perhaps he could gain a deeper understanding of the Dao Body and condense a Life Soul.</p>
<p>Condensing a Life Soul and advancing a Life Soul weren’t simple tasks. Not only did he need a lot of practice, but having perception and opportunities was also very important. He was temporarily stuck at advancing Slaughterer, the Inverse Ancient Sovereign, and Lost Country. All Zhou Wen could do was study the Dao Art and Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra.</p>
<p>He arrived at the peony garden and indeed, he saw a bunch of flowers. At a glance, there was a stretch of colorful flowers that extended for hundreds of kilometers. They were like a breathtakingly beautiful sea of flowers.</p>
<p>The beauty of peony gave people a sense of oppression. Some people felt that it was too beautiful, while others felt that it was a glorious beauty. Some even said that peony was the queen of flowers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know much about flowers. He only felt that the peony flowers were indeed beautiful. As they had transformed into dimensional creatures, the beauty of peony was even more shocking.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked into the garden and found a stone pavilion in the sea of flowers. As he sat in the stone pavilion, he gamed while taking in the flora and fauna.</p>
<p>The peony garden was indeed different from other dimensional zones. It was quiet and tranquil, and the fragrance of flowers was refreshing. Apart from the stunning beauty of the peony flowers, it was indeed a good quiet place.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t have any special insights. As he circulated the Dao Art, he gamed. He didn’t make any progress with the Dao Art, so he focused on gaming and didn’t think too much about it.</p>
<p>After playing for a few hours, he heard footsteps.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally didn’t plan on paying attention to them, but the footsteps approached his stone pavilion. He used Truth Listener’s ability to listen.</p>
<p>Two people came. One was a middle-aged man and the other was a twelve-year-old youth. The two of them were dressed in odd plain clothes. A robe was worn outside, and they did not look like locals.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man walked in front. The young man held a sheathed saber in his hand and followed behind the middle-aged man.</p>
<p>The two of them walked all the way to the stone pavilion. They didn’t walk very fast, as if they were taking a stroll and enjoying the scenery of Peony Garden.</p>
<p>To be honest, the peony was indeed beautiful, but there was a limit to being able to appreciate it. This was also why many people always found the grass greener on the other side.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because the things weren’t good, but because people were prone to change. They believed that what is rare is dear, and they didn’t know how to cherish all that they had seen.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man kept observing the peony flowers, but he still seemed to be in high spirits. He studied the peony flowers closely.</p>
<p>The youth’s temperament was clearly not as staid as the middle-aged man’s. After watching for a while, he found it boring, but he still followed behind the middle-aged man obediently. He did not cross the line and looked like he had a good upbringing.</p>
<p>“Teacher, there’s already someone inside this pavilion,” the youth said in disappointment when they arrived in front of the stone pavilion.</p>
<p>However, the middle-aged man did not mind. He stood outside the pavilion and asked, “Young friend, can you let us rest for a while?”</p>
<p>“Of course. The stone pavilion is a common facility. You can use it as long as you want,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>After thanking him, the middle-aged man walked into the stone pavilion with the young man.</p>
<p>The youth carried a large box on his back. He put the box down and opened it before taking out a cloth and laying it on the ground. Then, he took out a small wooden table and some random items. It looked like a picnic, but the tools on the table looked like they were used for brewing tea.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man and the young man sat down at the small wooden table. The young man could make tea with those complicated tea sets.</p>
<p>“It’s fate that we meet. Young friend, if you don’t mind, why don’t you try our hometown tea?” the middle-aged man said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your kindness. I’m not thirsty.” After saying that, Zhou Wen continued gaming.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man didn’t mind either. As he drank his tea, he enjoyed the flowers. He looked rather pleased.</p>
<p>“Teacher, there are so many famous dimensional zones in Luoyang. Why do we have to come to peony garden? Even dimensional creatures are rare here. Is there anything special about this place?” The youth brewed a cup of tea and sat opposite him, asking the middle-aged man.</p>
<h3 id='chapter502'>Chapter 502 Not On The Same Level</h3>
<p>“Flowers are like life. The plum blossoms are proud to the core and their chrysanthemums are lofty and pure. They bloom when other flowers wilt. Therefore, the first impression you have of them is that they are extraordinary. However, the peony is different. Its blooming time is not unique. Many flowers bloom in the same period of time, but in this season when the flowers bloom, it is still able to stand out. This is a kind of temperament, a kind of fearlessness. The plum blossoms and chrysanthemums are unique, but if they can stand out among the masses, they are extraordinary in different ways, first among extraordinariness,” said the middle-aged man.</p>
<p>The young man did not seem to understand what he was saying. He looked up at the peony flower outside the stone pavilion. It was beautiful, but after looking at it for a long time, he got used to it.</p>
<p>After some thought, the youth said, “I still like the cherry blossoms from our hometown. They aren’t that colorful, but they are still as beautiful. Furthermore, when they are at their most beautiful, they will wither. They won’t slowly wither like the flowers here which serves to remind me of heroes dying at their prime.”</p>
<p>“The momentary brilliance is naturally the most beautiful. However, life is not just an instance. Cherry blossoms do not only bloom for a year,” the middle-aged man said after drinking a cup of tea.</p>
<p>The young man quickly brewed another cup for the middle-aged man. After the middle-aged man drank it, he said, “The temperature of the tea today is still a little lacking.”</p>
<p>“Teacher, we have been out for so long, and you always want me to make tea. When will you teach me the way of the sword?” The youth could not help but ask.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man smiled. “You’ve been with me for seventeen days since we set off. For you to endure asking until now, it’s clear that your father has brought you up rather differently.”</p>
<p>“Please enlighten me.” The youth bowed.</p>
<p>“My way of the sword is a little different from your family’s. It focuses on comprehending. I’ve already taught you for seventeen days, but you haven’t gained any insight yet. When you do figure something out, it will be time for me to teach you the moves involved,” said the middle-aged man.</p>
<p>“You’ve taught me for seventeen days?” The youth was slightly taken aback. He looked at the middle-aged man with some doubt and said, “But in these seventeen days, we’ve been traveling. You either get me to do some chores or make tea. When did you teach me anything?”</p>
<p>“That’s why you haven’t figured it out yet.” The middle-aged man smiled.</p>
<p>The young man was still a young man after all. The past seventeen days had seemingly ground away all his patience. He could not help but retort, “If I knew everything, Father wouldn’t have made me acknowledge you as my master. Please teach me.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, the young man knelt before the middle-aged man.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man shook his head. “Your level of insight is still insufficient.”</p>
<p>The youth was not convinced. He raised his head and said, “I’m twelve years old this year and have already advanced to Legendary. I once went to the East Heaven Academy to compete with the top ten geniuses in the way of the sword. No one in the entire East Heaven Academy was my match. If my level of insight isn’t sufficient, then who can meet the mark?”</p>
<p>“Sparring is ultimately only sparring. It doesn’t mean anything. Moreover, this world is very big. The East Heaven Academy is not equal to the entire world,” said the middle-aged man indifferently.</p>
<p>The youth could not help but feel enraged when he realized that he was unable to move the middle-aged man no matter what he said. However, his teacher was too famous. He was disciplined from a young age to not go against his teacher excessively.</p>
<p>He had nowhere to vent his pent-up anger. Just as the youth was feeling upset, he suddenly thought of Zhou Wen on the other side of the stone pavilion. He stood up and walked in front of Zhou Wen. He bowed slightly and asked, “Are you a local here?”</p>
<p>“No, I study here,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>The youth’s eyes lit up when he heard that. He sized up Zhou Wen and asked, “Which school are you from?”</p>
<p>“Sunset College,” Zhou Wen casually replied when he saw that he was rather polite.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of Sunset College. It’s a college that’s in the Federation’s top ten. It should be the best school here, right?” The youth’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>“Probably,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>When the youth heard that, he turned to the middle-aged man and asked, “Teacher, Sunset College is one of the top ten academies in the Federation. It’s ranked higher than East Heaven Academy. They don’t know who I am, so they naturally won’t give in to me. If I can defeat the best student at Sunset College, will you be able to teach me the way of the sword?”</p>
<p>The middle-aged man merely smiled and did not speak. He picked up the teacup and took a sip.</p>
<p>Without any reply from his teacher, the youth bowed and said, “Then I’ll take it that Teacher has agreed.”</p>
<p>With that said, the youth stood up and walked in front of Zhou Wen. He asked, “May I ask who is the strongest student at Sunset College?”</p>
<p>“Strongest?” Zhou Wen thought carefully before replying, “I guess the publicly recognized number one person should be the president of the student council, right?”</p>
<p>“What’s his name?” The youth asked.</p>
<p>“Wei Ge,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“Wei Ge?” The youth repeated it a few times before walking to the middle-aged man and bowing. “Teacher, I’ll go to Sunset College to challenge its strongest student. After I return victorious, you should be able to teach me the way of the sword, right?”</p>
<p>“There’s a student from Sunset College here. Why do you have to seek someone so far?” the middle-aged man glanced at Zhou Wen and said with a smile.</p>
<p>The youth said, “I want to defeat the strongest student of Sunset College, not an ordinary student.”</p>
<p>“But in my opinion, he is stronger than you,” the middle-aged man said.</p>
<p>The youth naturally refused to believe him. He looked at Zhou Wen and asked, “What’s your standard in Sunset College?”</p>
<p>“Very weak. It’s considered mediocre. You should go to Sunset College to find Wei Ge,” Zhou Wen said. He wasn’t interested in dealing with the child.</p>
<p>The youth looked at the middle-aged man and said, “Teacher, it seems that you have misjudged this time.”</p>
<p>The middle-aged man ignored the youth and looked at Zhou Wen with a smile. “My young friend, may I ask what rank you were in the last comprehensive test at Sunset College?”</p>
<p>“I barely ranked tenth,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>The youth sized up Zhou Wen again when he heard that. After a while, he nodded and said, “Tenth place is indeed lacking. However, since Teacher has spoken, I’ll first defeat you before challenging the best, Wei Ge.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, the youth made a strange hand gesture and said, “Please accept my challenge.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I don’t have time,” Zhou Wen said as he played games. He was completely uninterested in the youth and had no interest in bullying children.</p>
<p>The youth couldn’t help but frown slightly. Zhou Wen’s attitude made him feel belittled.</p>
<p>“I’m Honn Shinsakura. Please enlighten me.” The young man stood as though he was about to draw his saber and held the handle of the saber as if he was about to strike at any moment.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already rejected him, so there was no need for him to repeat himself. He ignored him and continued gaming.</p>
<p>A sliver of anger flashed in Honn Shinsakura’s eyes as he suddenly unsheathed his saber. The saber beam flashed and slashed at Zhou Wen like lightning.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still gaming. He didn’t even raise his eyelids as the saber beams slashed past him. Although it looked dangerous, it didn’t even hit his clothes.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man’s expression changed slightly. He stood up and said, “Shin, step back. He is not on the same level as you.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter503'>Chapter 503 Sei Gasakai</h3>
<p>Honn Shinsakura was not convinced to begin with. After hearing his teacher’s evaluation, he became even more indignant. However, his teacher had already stood up. As a disciple, he had to maintain his etiquette. He could only step aside and sulk.</p>
<p>“I’m Sei Gasakai. May I know your name?” the middle-aged man asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to be this polite with me. My name is Zhou Wen,” Zhou Wen said as he put down his phone.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen had never heard of the name Sei Gasakai, he didn’t think much of it. However, this name was famous in another region and even the entire Federation.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Sword Hero Sei Gasakai, many people who practiced the way of the sword knew that he used to be a first-rate sword master who practiced Niten Ichi-ryū ten years ago, and he was also famous locally for his good looks.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t know any of this.</p>
<p>Seeing his teacher, Sei Gasakai, solemnly mention his name, while Zhou Wen only sat there silently, Honn Shinsakura could not help but snort coldly. He felt that Zhou Wen didn’t respect his teacher, Sei Gasakai.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai didn’t mind as he said with a smile, “Zhou Wen, are you familiar with Chancellor Leng Zongzheng in your studies at Sunset College?”</p>
<p>“It’s very rare to see Chancellor Leng. He’s no longer teaching,” Zhou Wen answered truthfully.</p>
<p>“Isn’t your mentor Leng Zongzheng? Then who is your mentor?” Sei Gasakai was slightly surprised.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was so young, yet he had such a cultivation realm. He believed that Zhou Wen was Leng Zongzheng’s student. His visit to Luoyang was to challenge Leng Zongzheng.</p>
<p>“Wang Fei,” Zhou Wen answered subconsciously.</p>
<p>After Wang Fei left, many things happened to Zhou Wen. He seldom interacted with the new tutor, and he still thought of Wang Fei as his tutor. Furthermore, Wang Fei and Wang Mingyuan were both members of Luoyang’s Wang family. Zhou Wen subconsciously wanted to acknowledge Wang Fei as his tutor.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai thought for a moment. He had never heard of this name before. In fact, Sei Gasakai didn’t like the other teachers of Sunset College. He believed that the only one worthy to fight him at Sunset College was the chancellor, Leng Zongzheng. Therefore, he didn’t know much about the other teachers. He only knew a few of the more famous tutors.</p>
<p>Even though the mentors were rather famous in the Federation, Sei Gasakai did not think of them as opponents.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen wasn’t a student taught by Leng Zongzheng, since he was a student of Sunset College and had such accomplishments at such a young age, Sei Gasakai wanted to know of Zhou Wen’s accomplishments.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai originally could only tell that Zhou Wen’s cultivation level wasn’t bad. He remained unperturbed despite being in front of them. This made him find the young student pretty good.</p>
<p>It was only later, when Honn Shinsakura probed Zhou Wen, hoping to force him to take action, did Sei Gasakai realize that Zhou Wen wasn’t ordinary. His martial realm wasn’t low, but it wasn’t obvious how high it was.</p>
<p>“If there’s nothing else, I wish to continue gaming.” Zhou Wen lowered his head and continued gaming.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai didn’t make any remarks as he looked at the peony flower outside the stone pavilion. A gust of wind blew past, and a withered petal fell, blowing into the stone pavilion. He extended his slender fingers and clamped the petal between his fingers.</p>
<p>“Little friend, take a look at this petal. Do you see anything different about it?” With that said, Sei Gasakai extended his index finger and middle finger towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately felt his body tremble as he couldn’t help but look up at Sei Gasakai.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai’s finger wasn’t fast, but when it landed in Zhou Wen’s eyes, the scenery was completely different.</p>
<p>The life force in the peony garden seemed to have followed Sei Gasakai’s finger. It was as if he was the lord of the peony garden, and the peony garden moved under his power.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that he wasn’t facing Sei Gasakai, but the billions of flowers in the peony garden. The power gathered on the petals was like a boundless sea. He immediately felt immense pressure.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wore a solemn expression as he sat on the bench. His fingers were like swords as he extended them towards the petal delivered by Sei Gasakai, clamping the other side of the petal.</p>
<p>At that instant, Zhou Wen felt a strange force rush over.</p>
<p>Flowers bloomed and fell. The sun rose and set. From life to death, Zhou Wen felt his body rapidly aging as time flew by.</p>
<p>A strange glint flashed across Sei Gasakai’s eyes. In the past, he had cultivated Niten Ichi-ryū. The so-called Niten Ichi-ryū meant that the sky had the sun and the moon, and humans were divided into Yin and Yang. The Niten Ichi-ryū was also about complementing Yin and Yang.</p>
<p>Niten Ichi-ryū warriors usually held a tachi in their right hand and a small tachi in their left hand. This Yin and Yang produced endless changes.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai was extremely talented. After being repeatedly honed by dimensional zones and gaining insights, not only did he reach the pinnacle of Niten Ichi-ryū, but he had also basically created a lineage using the Niten Ichi-ryū as a foundation, allowing his strength to improve greatly.</p>
<p>This lineage not only focused on Yin and Yang, the incorporeal and corporeal, but it also had a great relationship with time and life. Sei Gasakai had yet to name this lineage. This time, he had come to Luoyang to challenge Leng Zongzheng. If he could defeat him, he planned to name the lineage he created.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was a student of Sunset College, Sei Gasakai had originally planned on using his newly created technique to test his cultivation level and realm. He didn’t really want to fight him.</p>
<p>However, when he used the Will Renewal concept in his saber art, he realized that Zhou Wen wasn’t affected at all. With that, he gradually strengthened his will in the sword.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt as though countless flowers had bloomed before waning as time seemed to pass rapidly. It was as though the entire peony garden had turned into a flower graveyard. He had also gone from young to old as though he was about to die.</p>
<p>When Sei Gasakai saw that Zhou Wen remained unmoved, he couldn’t help but be astonished. He had already thought highly of Zhou Wen to begin with, but he never expected the youth in front of him to be even stronger than he had imagined. He couldn’t help but strengthen his sword will as it changed from the Will Renewal to life and death.</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura watched from the side, but he didn’t sense anything. All he saw was Zhou Wen and Sei Gasakai each holding a petal. One of them was standing while the other was sitting, motionless.</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura was somewhat puzzled. He did not know what his teacher Sei Gasakai was doing, but he did not dare disturb him. He could only wait patiently by the side.</p>
<p>But as he watched, Honn Shinsakura’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>His teacher, Sei Gasakai, had his hair band snap and his long black hair flowed down. His long black hair was gradually turning white. In just moments, his long black hair had turned snow-white.</p>
<p>“Teacher, what’s wrong?” Honn Shinsakura was alarmed as he hurriedly stood up. He wanted to rush over and push Zhou Wen away.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>However, just as he took a few steps towards Zhou Wen, he felt a terrifying force slam into him. His body involuntarily flew out and landed outside the stone pavilion. Blood oozed out of his mouth and a few of his bones were broken. He looked at Zhou Wen in the stone pavilion in horror and struggled several times but failed to get up.</p>
<h3 id='chapter504'>Chapter 504 Dao Body“s Soul Condensation</h3>
<p>After Zhou Wen arrived at the Peony Garden, he had been constantly circulating the Dao Art. When Sei Gasakai’s sword will crashed down on him, it made him feel both a Will Renewal and life and death. However, this pressure didn’t cause Zhou Wen’s will to waver. Instead, he suddenly seemed to gain enlightenment.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s enlightenment, the Dao Sutra in his body also underwent some strange changes. His Dao Body and essence, vitality, and spirit were trembling. His entire body and mind seemed to resonate with everything in the world, causing them to constantly transform and condense within his body.</p>
<p>At this moment, Zhou Wen had actually begun condensing a Dao Sutra Life Soul.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai didn’t know that his sword will was useless against Zhou Wen. Instead, it aided Zhou Wen by constantly giving him insights.</p>
<p>Seeing how Zhou Wen remained motionless, Sei Gasakai was alarmed. He pushed the sword will he had comprehended to its limits. His Essence Energy had already been infused into it. It wasn’t as simple as probing anymore. It was a true sparring match. The sword’s force surged towards Zhou Wen through the flower petal that the two were holding.</p>
<p>This nameless sword strike was still unable to shake Zhou Wen despite Sei Gasakai pushing his sword will to the extreme.</p>
<p>His sword force, which carried the Will Renewal as well as life and death, vanished without a trace after entering Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai was shocked. He had relied on his comprehension of this strike to push his Life Soul to Perfect stage. He had even planned on using this strike to challenge Leng Zongzheng.</p>
<p>However, who knew that this strike wouldn’t even be able to do a thing to a mere student of Sunset College? Instantly, Sei Gasakai felt despair. He felt like he had lost all hope in life. His black hair turned white in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai had no idea that even if his strike were to clash with Leng Zongzheng, it was impossible for it to be ineffective. However, Zhou Wen’s Dao Body and the Life Soul he was condensing were the nemeses of his strike.</p>
<p>If he were to use his Life Soul to fight Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen was definitely not his match. However, just the Power of Life and Death alone was unable to do a thing to him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt his essence, vitality, and spirit condense towards his brain. The power of Sei Gasakai’s sword was also sucked in. A certain power in the world was flowing towards his brain, pouring into him like a river.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that a crystal had condensed in his mind. The crystal was very strange, as though it was in his brain, but it wasn’t anywhere in his brain. It was as though it was something that only existed in his consciousness, but Zhou Wen could clearly sense its existence.</p>
<p>Once the Life Soul was formed, Zhou Wen immediately felt refreshed as though he had been reborn. Boundless Essence Energy surged out of the crystal-like Life Soul, making him feel like he was bathing in a spring.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai could not accept the fact that he was inferior to a student at Sunset College. He could not accept that the Sword Dao he had comprehended over the years was completely useless.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen’s Life Soul condensed, the fluctuations of the Life Soul’s power caused Sei Gasakai’s Life Soul to vibrate. A Sword Soul that resembled a devil or a god appeared over Sei Gasakai’s body.</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura was dumbfounded. He had never expected that his teacher, the renowned Sword Hero, Sei Gasakai, would use his Life Soul when he was competing with a student.</p>
<p>That was a Perfect Life Soul, Samsara Sword Sage. Countless Epic experts were defeated by the Reincarnation Sword Sage of Sei Gasakai. It was a supreme existence with the power to determine life and death.</p>
<p>In the next second, Honn Shinsakura saw Sei Gasakai’s white hair fluttering in the wind. The Samsara Sword Sage had merged with Sei Gasakai, and a tachi condensed from light and darkness appeared in his hand. The petal had already melted from the terrifying power.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai held the tachi in his hand. In his despair, he no longer had any other thoughts. All he wanted to do was prove himself and his Sword Dao as he slashed at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Wherever the blade beam passed, the surrounding flowers were affected by it. Half of the flowers were blooming, while the other half was wilting, as though heaven and hell were separated.</p>
<p>Teacher actually used this strike… Honn Shinsakura was extremely shocked.</p>
<p>Not only did Sei Gasakai use his Life Soul, but he also used his most powerful strike. This strike was something Honn Shinsakura had only heard from his father, but he had never seen it before.</p>
<p>His father had seen this move of Sei Gasakai’s. He had originally been comparable to Sei Gasakai in strength, but in the end, he decided to hand over his beloved son, Honn Shinsakura, to Sei Gasakai for guidance. Furthermore, he held Sei Gasakai in high esteem, saying that he was the number one sword practitioner.</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura followed Sei Gasakai and wanted to learn this move the most. However, Sei Gasakai had never used it before, so he had never seen it. Today was the first time he had truly witnessed this attack.</p>
<p>However, the strike that was described as an attack that could kill devils and gods alike was actually used by Sei Gasakai against a student. This made Honn Shinsakura feel incredulous.</p>
<p>However, he had finally witnessed the power of the strike. It was truly an attack that wielded the power of a devil or a god. However, due to the power of the attack, the peony garden was reduced to hell. All the flowers had withered. Such power was truly awe-inspiring.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder even a person like Father holds such high regard for Teacher. With such a powerful strike, who in the world can match it? Honn Shinsakura praised in his heart.</p>
<p>But in the next second, Honn Shinsakura was rooted to the spot. His eyes widened to the extreme, but his pupils constricted like needles as he looked into the stone pavilion in disbelief.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still sitting on the bench in the stone pavilion. He wasn’t moved by Sei Gasakai’s mighty strike, nor did he have any intention of standing up. All he did was grab a jade bamboo in his hand.</p>
<p>There was a flash; a saber revealed itself in the bamboo.</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura had never seen such a magnificent and domineering technique before. The gorgeous saber beam sliced through the void, leaving an inextinguishable mark on his mind.</p>
<p>When Honn Shinsakura looked at the saber beam clearly, he realized that the Bamboo Blade had already returned to its sheath, as though it had never moved.</p>
<p>However, when he looked at Sei Gasakai again, the attack condensed from light and darkness in his hand suddenly broke apart, turning into specks of starlight before dissipating. The terrifying intent also shattered.</p>
<p>“I… lost…” Sei Gasakai stood there and stared at Zhou Wen in a daze, his eyes had already lost focus.</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura sat on the ground. He really could not accept this outcome. Sei Gasakai, the man known as the number one Sword Hero—his teacher—had actually been defeated by a student who was not much older than him.</p>
<p>Looking at Zhou Wen, who was still sitting in the stone pavilion, Honn Shinsakura suddenly felt that he wasn’t a person but a devil. The earlier strike was a devil’s power.</p>
<p>However, that gorgeous saber move had left an inextinguishable mark deep within his soul. He could not help but recall it repeatedly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter505'>Chapter 505 Niten Flying Immortal-ryū</h3>
<p>“Teacher!” Honn Shinsakura suddenly saw a trickle of blood on Sei Gasakai’s neck. He couldn’t help but be shocked and went to rush over.</p>
<p>“If I were you, I wouldn’t touch him,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, Honn Shinsakura’s body trembled. He stood outside the stone pavilion and didn’t rush in. He stared at Zhou Wen and gritted his teeth as he asked, “Your Excellency, since you have already won, why do you have to go so far as to kill him?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pointed at Sei Gasakai and said, “I’m not a murderer. Why would I kill him? Your teacher is probably envisaging a battle in his mind. I don’t know what will happen if you disturb him.”</p>
<p>Doubtful, Honn Shinsakura looked at Sei Gasakai. Seeing that his teacher was standing there in a daze, his eyes empty, and the wound on his neck only a superficial wound, he heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“What’s the name of the strike your teacher used just now?” Zhou Wen asked as he looked at Honn Shinsakura.</p>
<p>He now had comprehended the meaning of Will Renewal and life and death thanks to Sei Gasakai’s sword will. He had understood the relationship between humans and nature, which allowed the Dao Body to condense a Life Soul. From this, one could tell that Sei Gasakai’s move was indeed powerful.</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura didn’t dare belittle Zhou Wen any further. Although there wasn’t much of a difference in age between the two of them, he treated himself as a junior. He cautiously answered, “That move isn’t named. My teacher used the Niten Ichi-ryū as a foundation before comprehending the Four Seasons’ Will Renewal and Life-and-Death Samsara concepts. He then created this blade technique.”</p>
<p>“I see.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly and got up to leave.</p>
<p>He came to the Peony Garden because he wanted to see if he could condense a Dao Body Life Soul. Although the Peony Garden failed to help him, in a way, Sei Gasakai had helped him.</p>
<p>Zero Taboo (Primordial Body): Union of Heaven and Man, Invulnerable to all Spells</p>
<p>With the appearance of the Life Soul, the word “taboo” behind Essence Energy disappeared.</p>
<p>This was a Life Soul condensed from a Dao Body. It was somewhat odd with being a crystal in his consciousness that seemed to have a corporeal form, but it also seemed incorporeal. It was this Life Soul that had blocked Sei Gasakai’s Will Renewal move. It nullified the powers for Zhou Wen, allowing him to defeat Sei Gasakai.</p>
<p>In terms of pure strength, Sei Gasakai’s Perfect-stage Samsara Sword Sage was much stronger than Zhou Wen’s Life Soul. If he hadn’t used that move and had used ordinary Essence Energy to fight Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen’s strike wouldn’t have been able to win so easily.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Zhou Wen walk out of the stone pavilion, Honn Shinsakura anxiously asked, “How’s my teacher?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t hurt him. It’s just that he doesn’t understand something. He’ll naturally recover once he figures it out,” Zhou Wen said without turning his head.</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura hesitated for a moment. Seeing that Zhou Wen was about to leave, he couldn’t help but shout at Zhou Wen’s back, “What’s the name of that strike of yours?”</p>
<p>“Transcendent Flying Immortal,” Zhou Wen answered as he walked. Soon, he entered the flower shrubs.</p>
<p>“Transcendent… Flying… Immortal…” The gorgeous saber flashed through Honn Shinsakura’s mind again. That gesture sent shockwaves into his soul, one that he could not forget.</p>
<p>An old man and a young man stood in the stone pavilion in a daze while the other stood outside the stone pavilion in a daze. After a while, Honn Shinsakura suddenly heard a cry and hurriedly turned to look at Sei Gasakai.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai spat out a mouthful of blood. Honn Shinsakura hurriedly rushed to Sei Gasakai. “Teacher, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai spat out a mouthful of blood, but his expression was much better. He wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and revealed a smile. “So that’s how it is… I see… It’s no wonder I didn’t name the move. It turns out that deep in my heart, I knew that it wasn’t right. Now I finally understand where I was wrong…”</p>
<p>With that said, Sei Gasakai looked around but didn’t see Zhou Wen. He asked, “Where’s Zhou Wen-kun?”</p>
<p>“He went back,” Honn Shinsakura answered.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you stop him?” Sei Gasakai blurted out.</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura thought to himself, How can I stop him when even you can’t?</p>
<p>Of course, he did not say that out loud. Sei Gasakai probably realized that something was wrong with what he said, so he asked him, “Did you ask him what the name of that attack was?”</p>
<p>“He said it was Transcendent Flying Immortal,” Honn Shinsakura replied.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai nodded and said, “So that saber move is called Transcendent Flying Immortal. My blade technique has taken the wrong path. I’ve been blindly pursuing the path of Will Renewal and life and death, but I’ve lost the true essence of Niten Ichi-ryū. To think that I was so arrogant that I thought that my accomplishments had already reached the crest of perfection and even had the thoughts of challenging Leng Zongzheng. I never expected that even a student from Sunset College could nullify my sword technique. That’s good. After this battle, I’ve finally seen the path ahead clearly. I’m going back to revise my blade technique. Are you still willing to cultivate with me?”</p>
<p>“You will forever be my teacher.” Honn Shinsakura immediately bowed.</p>
<p>“Alright, we’ll head back now. I’ll revamp my blade technique. From now on, this lineage will be called the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū,” Sei Gasakai said seriously.</p>
<p>“Niten Flying Immortal-ryū?” Honn Shinsakura looked at Sei Gasakai in confusion.</p>
<p>“My Sword Dao came from the Niten Ichi-ryū , and the strike that Zhou Wen-Kun used to give me a wake-up call is called Transcendent Flying Immortal. In order to show respect, my style shall be called the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū. I hope that after you inherit my Sword Dao in the future, you will be able to advance further and use the blade technique of my Niten Flying Immortal-ryū to defeat his Transcendent Flying Immortal,” said Sei Gasakai.</p>
<p>“Niten Flying Immortal-ryū?” Honn Shinsakura muttered to himself as Zhou Wen’s gorgeous saber appeared in his mind.</p>
<p>The master and disciple no longer went to find Leng Zongzheng and chose to leave Luoyang.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t take this matter to heart, but he didn’t know that in the future, the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū would become a mainstream sword sect overseas. But all of this was in the future.</p>
<p>After returning to his dorm, Zhou Wen began studying the Zero Taboo Life Soul. He wanted to know what use it had.</p>
<p>As of now, what he knew was that it could nullify the Power of Will Renewal and Power of Death, but this was clearly not the true effect of the Zero Taboo.</p>
<p>After launching the game dungeon, Zhou Wen entered the Metalwork Temple. He wanted to see if the Zero Taboo could block the power of the flames, but unfortunately, the blood-colored avatar was nearly burned to death.</p>
<p>It can’t block the power of fire? Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and changed to another dungeon. He went to the Music Temple to try resisting the sound waves.</p>
<p>However, it was useless. After activating the Zero Taboo, the sound wave struck the blood-colored avatar, sending it flying several meters away. It was so painful that Zhou Wen nearly convulsed.</p>
<p>It can’t be? Don’t tell me that this thing can only block the Power of Will Renewal and Death? Just as Zhou Wen was feeling depressed, he saw a Sun Beast rush out of the palace.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t experiment any further. He summoned the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon and made it kill the Sun Beast. After grinding so many times, he didn’t even have a Companion Egg drop. He didn’t hold any hopes this time, but the Sun Beast ended up dropping a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>It’s finally here. Zhou Wen forgot about the Zero Taboo as his emotions became complicated.</p>
<p>With the Sun Beast, he could finally fight Torch Dragon.</p>
<h3 id='chapter506'>Chapter 506 Fusion Armor</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen had killed plenty of Sun Beasts, but this was the first time he had seen one clearly.</p>
<p>As the Sun Beast’s glare was so strong, it usually looked like a small sun. However, in reality, the Sun Beast was just a small crystal-like beast. It wasn’t too big and emitted an intense light.</p>
<p>Sun Beast: Epic</p>
<p>Life Providence: Son of the Sun.</p>
<p>Life Soul: Solar Radiance</p>
<p>Strength: 39</p>
<p>Speed: 38</p>
<p>Constitution: 39</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 39</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Sun Arc.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Crystal Mirror.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the Sun Beast and transformed it into a companion form. An intrinsic, sundial-like mirror appeared in his hand. The mirror clearly reflected Zhou Wen’s shadow. It wasn’t inferior to the modern-day mirrors; it was even clearer.</p>
<p>Looking at the crystal mirror, Zhou Wen thought of a problem.</p>
<p>This mirror was more than enough to block his face, and it was just big enough to block his chest. However, he couldn’t hide his entire body behind the mirror.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if blocking a part of his body was of any use against Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>Taking the Sun Beast with him, Zhou Wen opened the game dungeon and planned on giving it a try.</p>
<p>Once again, he came to the shrine and summoned the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, allowing it to charge into the temple as a vanguard.</p>
<p>Under Zhou Wen’s control, the blood-colored avatar cooperated with the six-winged Guardian Dragon and dealt with Torch Dragon. As Zhou Wen didn’t know when Torch Dragon would use the Bright Torch Vision World, he kept paying attention to Torch Dragon’s eyes.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon’s eyes were usually dim. When it used Bright Torch Vision World, the eyes would first light up before turning into a mirror.</p>
<p>The process in the middle was a brief instant. Zhou Wen had to summon the Sun Beast when Torch Dragon used Bright Torch Vision World. There was some skill involved.</p>
<p>As the Sun Beast was only at the Epic stage, it was impossible to summon it too early or it would die under the intense combat strength. Therefore, Zhou Wen could only use this strategy.</p>
<p>He was extremely familiar with Torch Dragon. When it used Bright Torch Vision World, Zhou Wen summoned the crystal mirror in front of him and blocked the blood-colored avatar’s face.</p>
<p>In the next second, Zhou Wen saw a strange scene. The crystal mirror and blood-colored avatar’s faces were indeed fine, but its body vanished. Then, the game screen turned black.</p>
<p>The Thearch didn’t lie to me. The mirror is indeed useful, but the crystal mirror is a little too small. Zhou Wen wasn’t discouraged. He knew that the mirror could restrain Torch Dragon, so killing it was only a matter of time.</p>
<p>He went online to search for information again to see if there were any bigger mirror Companion Eggs. However, he was somewhat disappointed. All known mirror Companion Beasts were relatively small in size. It was basically impossible to hide behind a mirror.</p>
<p>The biggest known Companion Beast mirror was a magic mirror in the West District. However, the magic mirror was at the Mythical stage. Up to this day, the six families had yet to destroy it.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, getting a big mirror won’t work. Is there any other way? Zhou Wen thought hard about how to use the smaller crystal mirror to perfectly crack Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen constantly came up with new strategies and kept experimenting. He spent a large amount of time grinding dungeons every day.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had yet to finish Torch Dragon, but he had obtained a Three-Eyed Golden Warrior Companion Egg.</p>
<p>He combined it with the Epic Golden Warrior that he had previously combined. Although they were both Golden Warriors, their compatibility was only slightly more than sixty.</p>
<p>After hesitating for a moment, he chose to fuse them. Then, he watched as the Golden Warrior and the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior Companion Egg were gradually devoured by the light before they merged into one.</p>
<p>When the light dissipated and a Golden Warrior appeared on the game’s screen, Zhou Wen finally relaxed.</p>
<p>The stats of the Golden Warrior increased significantly after being fused. All of them were above 30, and his luck was quite different. With the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior as a supplement, it retained its Invulnerable Golden Body. As such, the Golden Warrior had Golden Bell, Invulnerable Golden Body, and the Fist of War.</p>
<p>Fist of War wasn’t of much use to Zhou Wen. He mainly focused on the Golden Bell and Invulnerable Golden Body, which greatly enhanced his defense.</p>
<p>When he went to the temple to attack Torch Dragon again, Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Warrior to see how strong its defense was.</p>
<p>However, what surprised Zhou Wen was that the Golden Bell and Invulnerable Golden Body, along with the augmentation of Blessed Combat Runes allowed it to withstand one blow of the Torch Dragon’s tail. Its body crashed into the palace wall, but it wasn’t seriously injured.</p>
<p>This seemingly ordinary Golden Warrior was finally killed after withstanding Torch Dragon’s four attacks.</p>
<p>This was already out of Zhou Wen’s expectations. Among Epic Companion Beasts, there weren’t many who could withstand a single strike from Torch Dragon. For a Golden Warrior to withstand four strikes was already shocking.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Golden Warrior could not block Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>This Golden Warrior looks like an ordinary Golden Warrior, but its strength far exceeds that of a Golden Warrior. If an ordinary person were to treat it as a Golden Warrior, they would probably suffer terribly. That’s an advantage. Zhou Wen thought to himself if he were to find a publicly recognized weak Companion Beast in the future and combine all sorts of powerful skills with it. This way, he would be able to catch any enemy off guard.</p>
<p>Upon thinking of a weak Companion Beast, Zhou Wen thought of the Lucky Baby Tiger. This fellow was indeed the weakest among Epics. Apart from its Luck stat, it was completely useless.</p>
<p>I’ll try to fuse a powerful baby tiger when I get another baby tiger. Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Warrior and wore it as a golden soft armor.</p>
<p>The moment he wore it, he realized something different. The soft armor that a typical Golden Warrior transformed into was made of gold threads. It was pure gold without any patterns.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s soft armor had shimmering Blessed Combat Runes on it, making it look extremely dazzling.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t like being dazzling because that would make him a striking target.</p>
<p>“The Golden Warrior transforms into soft armor. I can still wear armor outside. I can use the Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior as the main ingredient and a Golden Warrior Companion Egg as a supplementary ingredient to form a Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior with a Golden Body Life Providence. Zhou Wen did as the idea came to him. Runic Heavy-Armored Warriors and Golden Warrior weren’t difficult to kill, but something went wrong when he fused them.</p>
<p>After the two were combined, the Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior did not obtain the Golden Warrior’s Life Providence. It was still his original Life Providence, but he had an additional skill.</p>
<p>After a few tries, the results were all different. Sometimes, there were more skills, and sometimes there were fewer. Only on the third time, did he obtain a Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior with the Golden Body Life Providence and Blessed Combat Runes Life Soul. However, that Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior did not even have a single skill.</p>
<h3 id='chapter507'>Chapter 507 Black Cube</h3>
<p>While Zhou Wen was grinding the dungeons, something strange happened in Luoyang City.</p>
<p>A crossroad in the city was blocked by a huge black cube. The black cube was about 50 meters long. It did not look like metal, but it did not look like stone or plastic either.</p>
<p>Strangely, no one knew when the black cube appeared. An Sheng, who was in charge of investigating the matter, looked at the nearby surveillance cameras and realized that the black cube had appeared out of thin air. It didn’t exist on the video then it appeared in the next second.</p>
<p>Such a strange matter was likely related to dimensional creatures. In order to prevent any accidents, An Sheng mobilized many experts from the Sunset army to research how to take away or destroy the black cube.</p>
<p>However, they tried many methods to no avail. They were unable to move the black cube away, nor were they able to damage it. Even the strongest destructive weapon and Essence Energy Skill that they could muster failed to damage the black cube one bit.</p>
<p>Some people dug up the concrete surface underneath the black cube and used some tools to move it away. However, they soon discovered that the black cube was actually suspended in midair. After the ground was dug open, it did not affect it at all and it still remained in position.</p>
<p>Although the black cube didn’t pose any threat, An Sheng still made preparations for the worst. He evacuated the nearby residents and temporarily isolated the area. He sent troops to guard it to prevent any accidents.</p>
<p>In less than two days, An Sheng received plenty of shocking updates. It wasn’t just Luoyang; many cities in the Federation’s four major districts had similar black cubes.</p>
<p>Now, everyone was studying the black cube. Up to now, no one had been able to determine what it was, nor could anyone destroy or move it.</p>
<p>Many people were worried like An Sheng. The black cube was like a ticking time bomb in the city. Who knew when it would cause a terrifying disaster.</p>
<p>“Strange phenomena are happening rather frequently. It looks like the days ahead will become more and more unpeaceful.” An Sheng sighed.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo was reading the intelligence gathered from all over the world. Even the cities of the six major families had black cubes. Furthermore, the six families were helpless against them.</p>
<p>The six families had sent out Mythical Companion Beasts to destroy or figure out what the black cube was, but the outcome wasn’t promising. The strength of Mythical Companion Beasts was still unable to harm the black cubes.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo frowned when he read the intelligence.</p>
<p>Black cubes had appeared all over the world; this was clearly unusual.</p>
<p>“Did you notice that these black cubes only appear in areas where humans gather? There are no black cubes in the wilderness or dimensional zones,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“You suspect that this is a conspiracy against humans?” An Sheng immediately understood what An Tianzuo was getting at.</p>
<p>“Although I don’t wish to see such a thing happen, the current phenomena’s analysis suggests that the black cubes are targeted at humans,” An Tianzuo said with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>“We shall handle it, come what may. Overseer, when have you ever been afraid of anything?” An Sheng deliberately said in a relaxed tone.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo smiled and stopped talking about the matter. He then asked An Sheng, “How’s the progress at Zhuolu?”</p>
<p>“There’s no progress. After a long analysis, the experts have roughly guessed that the snake is the legendary Torch Dragon. The other Mythical creature is Qiongqi, one of the four mythical ferocious beasts. Apart from that, there’s no progress. Unless a Mythical power involves itself in this matter, it’s impossible to make progress in the temple,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“How’s the mood of the person at home?” An Tianzuo paused before asking again.</p>
<p>“Same as usual. She eats whatever she likes and buys whatever she likes. However, I can tell that she can’t let this matter rest,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>After a long silence, An Tianzuo suddenly said, “How long will it take for a return trip to Zhuolu?”</p>
<p>An Sheng’s expression changed drastically when he heard that. “Overseer, you absolutely can’t do that. You definitely can’t go to Zhuolu. The strength of Torch Dragon and Qiongqi is still unknown. We haven’t even figured out what abilities they have. It’s too dangerous for you to go like this.”</p>
<p>“If we don’t figure out if Grandpa is in the temple, the person at home will probably not be at ease,” said An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>“Overseer, if you were to perish in there, Madam wouldn’t just be sad. Furthermore, there’s the bizarre black cube. A huge problem might happen at any time. This place needs you,” An Sheng said solemnly.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo’s expression changed when he heard that. After a long while, he sighed and said, “Ah Sheng, in the past, we only wanted to have the An family and Luoyang completely in our control. At that time, we thought that we could no longer have any reservations and do whatever we wanted. Now that we have truly become the masters of this place, we realize that the matters to take into consideration have increased.”</p>
<p>An Sheng looked at An Tianzuo and said seriously, “The lesser the burden, the fewer the matters to consider. Overseer, you’re burdened by too many things.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps.” An Tianzuo stood up and walked to the window. He looked at the black cube on the city’s streets as his expression turned more complicated.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had fused multiple pets without obtaining a Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior that he was satisfied with. All he could do was use the unskilled Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior for the time being.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, have you heard? A mysterious cube appeared on the streets in the city,” Li Xuan said mysteriously when he came to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What mysterious cube?” Zhou Wen had been focused on grinding dungeons recently. Apart from sending breakfast to Wang Lu, he hadn’t gone out, nor had anyone told him.</p>
<p>“You don’t know about it?” Li Xuan recounted the mysterious appearance of the black cube. “It’s not just our Luoyang. I heard that the same black cube has appeared all over the world. However, no one knows what it is.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown when he heard that. He was also worried. If the black cubes contained a few Mythical creatures, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and Zhou Wen chatted for a while before he suddenly recalled something. He said to Zhou Wen with a smile, “Gu Dian looks like a ruthless character, but he’s actually quite timid.”</p>
<p>“Why do you say that?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Didn’t we organize an activity previously and got Gu Dian to come with us? Fang Ruoxi brought her pet cat over. That pet cat wasn’t afraid of Gu Dian’s ferocious appearance and even jumped onto him. When he saw the cat, the usually ferocious Gu Dian ended up sitting on the ground in fright. His legs were so weak that he couldn’t even stand up. He just sat and crawled backward as though he was afraid that the cat would eat him… Don’t you think it’s funny… That kid usually looks quite manly. I never expected him to be so timid…” Li Xuan didn’t notice Zhou Wen’s odd expression when he spoke.</p>
<h3 id='chapter508'>Chapter 508 The Thearch“s Hin</h3>
<p>After Li Xuan left, Zhou Wen went online to investigate the news regarding the black cube. As the matter was huge news, and the cubes had appeared in many places, it was impossible to completely conceal the matter. Therefore, many places did an exposé. There were also many clear pictures of it.</p>
<p>One could not tell anything from the pictures. It was just a black cube.</p>
<p>What exactly is this? I wonder if The Thearch knows what it is? Zhou Wen was considering how to ask The Thearch when he suddenly received a message from her.</p>
<p>“Did a black cube appear in the place where you are now?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly replied when he saw The Thearch mention this matter herself. “Yes, a lot of them suddenly appeared in the world. I wonder what it is?”</p>
<p>“If I were you, I would take my Mythical Companion Beasts to the cube,” The Thearch replied.</p>
<p>“How can I have Mythical Companion Beasts?” Zhou Wen denied.</p>
<p>“What’s on your ear? Don’t tell me that’s an earring you bought online,” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>“What do I do with the Mythical Companion Beast there? What is that black cube?” Zhou Wen never expected The Thearch to recognize Truth Listener. However, he wasn’t surprised. He was only curious. The Thearch clearly knew what the black cube was.</p>
<p>“I don’t wish to tell you what it is, but as long as you take a Mythical Companion Beast over, there will definitely be benefits. Do you dare to go?” Before long, The Thearch sent a message.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned when he saw that. He didn’t know what The Thearch was up to. He didn’t trust The Thearch at all, afraid that she would scheme against him.</p>
<p>“The six families have already taken their Mythical Companion Beasts over, but they didn’t receive any benefits.” Zhou Wen replied without saying if he wanted to go.</p>
<p>“How can those ordinary people know of its benefits? With my guidance, naturally, it’ll be different.”</p>
<p>The Thearch immediately sent another message. “After you find the black cube, take a Mythical Companion Beast to the top of it. In the middle of the cube, there’s a circular dot. Get your Mythical Companion Beast to stand there and release all its Essence Energy and send it inside the dot. Remember, it can only be a Mythical Companion Beast. Essence Energy must be injected into the dot, or you will bear the consequences.”</p>
<p>“What will happen after the cube is opened?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you give it a try yourself? If you don’t have the guts, just wait for others to activate the cube. After all, if you don’t take the huge benefits, there are plenty of people who will.” The Thearch gave one final reply before she ignored Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately put in a difficult spot. The Thearch was clearly teasing him. She deliberately didn’t mention what the black cube was to make him feel conflicted.</p>
<p>This really makes me doubt life. You underestimate me too much. Zhou Wen packed his things and planned on taking a look at the black cube.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen planned on using his phone to take a picture. The black cube was definitely something from a different dimension. Perhaps the mysterious phone would react to it. It wouldn’t be too late to decide if he should try using The Thearch’s method.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare go out in the open. He took advantage of the night to sneak to the spot where he discovered the black cube. There was an army stationed there, but it was mainly to prevent any anomalies from happening to the black cube. They didn’t forbid humans from approaching, so it wasn’t difficult to get close.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen arrived at the roof of a nearby building which was already very close to the black cube. Standing at the edge of the building, he was only about ten meters away from the corner of the black cube.</p>
<p>Although it was night time, with Zhou Wen’s eyesight, he could see it clearly, but he couldn’t tell what material it was. It didn’t look like metal or stone, nor did it look like a horn or bone. Instead, it looked like some man-made material.</p>
<p>What is this? I hope the mysterious phone can divulge something. Zhou Wen held the mysterious phone and aimed it at the black cube.</p>
<p>However, it left Zhou Wen somewhat disappointed. The mysterious phone didn’t do a thing or lock-on to it. It clearly wasn’t interested in the black cube.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was put in a difficult spot. The Thearch had said that there were great benefits, but what if she was lying to him? If he really did as The Thearch said, it would be bad if he released a few demon monarch-level dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>However, after careful thought, Zhou Wen felt that The Thearch didn’t seem to have any reason to do so.</p>
<p>If The Thearch really wanted to mess with him, she could just make a wish. There was no need to go through so much trouble to trick him into coming here.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he had not sent the things that the Thearch had asked him to buy. If he were to release a few terrifying creatures and ended up dying, who would deliver the items to her?</p>
<p>Although The Thearch said it so easily as though she could find someone to deliver things to her at any time, how many humans dared to go to Chess Mountain? There were even fewer who dared to enter Chess Mountain to take the Void Flower. Zhou Wen suspected that there was only one pot of Void Flower in Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>After some thought, he believed that The Thearch wouldn’t let him die so easily so he decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already prepared. He wore the most ordinary heavy armor of the Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior. The armor could envelop his entire body. Furthermore, it was rather common in the Peninsula of Gods. Even if he was discovered, it wouldn’t be easy to find out who he was.</p>
<p>The garrison troops were all around the cube, and there wasn’t anyone above. Taking advantage of the darkness, Zhou Wen pushed Ghost Steps to the extreme. He traversed more than ten meters like black smoke and landed on the black cube without anyone noticing.</p>
<p>After stepping onto the black cube, nothing abnormal happened. Only then did Zhou Wen heave a sigh of relief and silently walk towards the center.</p>
<p>At the center, Zhou Wen indeed discovered the circle The Thearch mentioned.</p>
<p>The black cube was about fifty meters in length, but the circle was only the size of a palm. Furthermore, it was only a shallow round mark. If Zhou Wen didn’t know that it was useful, he wouldn’t have noticed it.</p>
<p>Which Mythical Companion Beast should I use to give it a try? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Excluding Tyrant Behemoth who was evolving, Zhou Wen still had four Mythical pets—Truth Listener, Banana Fairy, Demonic Neonate, and Six-Winged.</p>
<p>However, the first three hadn’t reached the Mythical stage yet. The real Mythical stage was Six-Winged.</p>
<p>After sizing up his surroundings, and seeing that there wasn’t anyone above him, he believed that even if he summoned Six-Winged, no one would see him. Zhou Wen decided to summon Six-Winged.</p>
<p>After all, if anything were to happen, Six-Winged was at the Mythical stage. It should be able to deal with the problem, but Truth Listener and Banana Fairy might be instantly killed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter509'>Chapter 509 Famous in the Federation</h3>
<p>When Six-Winged was summoned by Zhou Wen. Its huge body stood on the cube, but it wasn’t too obvious. However, its claws were a little too big. Its claws covered the tiny circle completely when pressed against it. As it was several times bigger than the circle, Zhou Wen didn’t know if this would work.“I’ll give it a try.” Zhou Wen was very careful. He didn’t let the six-winged dragon immediately attempt it. He only made it stand there and left. He returned to the top of the building beside him before letting the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon inject its Essence Energy into the circle.</p>
<p>If anything were to happen, he could immediately retrieve the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon and escape.</p>
<p>Although he felt that it was unlikely that The Thearch would harm him, he still had to be careful.</p>
<p>The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon followed Zhou Wen’s orders and pressed its paw on the circle, injecting its Essence Energy into it.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was mentally prepared, he was still alarmed the moment the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon injected Essence Energy.</p>
<p>The entire black cube instantly lit up, illuminating the surroundings. Zhou Wen was alarmed. He wanted to retrieve the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, but he realized that the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon seemed to have been sucked into the black cube, preventing him from retrieving it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression changed drastically when he saw the black cube’s situation.</p>
<p>It was no longer a black cube. It was like a huge six-sided screen. The four sides of the screen were glowing brightly, resembling liquid crystal displays. There were even images on it.</p>
<p>The images weren’t anything else but the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon that was standing on the cube. Furthermore, it was the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon after it released its Life Soul.</p>
<p>One could imagine the scene. The four sides of the screen were all 50 meters long and were many times clearer than any 4K high-definition screen. Even the tiny dark lines on the scales of the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon could be seen clearly.</p>
<p>The fifty-meter-tall screen could be seen more than ten kilometers away. Anyone who had not slept and was outside could see the image on the cube from all directions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the top of the cube was also glowing brightly, illuminating the Six-Winged Dragon like a statue. It would be impossible not to see it.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was secretly glad that he wasn’t standing on top. Otherwise, he would really be famous.</p>
<p>The military was alarmed, likewise for the reporters and gossip mongers. Phones rang everywhere. In just two to three minutes, the quiet night suddenly became lively.</p>
<p>People rushed to the streets, or ran to the high buildings and looked in the direction of the cube.</p>
<p>“Dear viewers… Dear viewers… This is News Today. I’m Reporter Xiaojing. I’m putting my life at risk going live here at the black cube which appeared a few days ago. Just a minute ago, it suddenly lit up. We can see that the side of the cube has become an ultra-high-definition big screen. And on the cube, there’s a terrifying dimensional creature. It looks like it’s a legendary dragon from the West District. Furthermore, it has six wings, and its body is burning with terrifying black flames. It’s very likely to have escaped from the cube. Will such a terrifying creature bring great disaster to our city…”</p>
<p>The Thearch tricked me again! Zhou Wen was somewhat dumbfounded. He had been trying to retrieve the six-winged dragon, but he couldn’t.</p>
<p>The army had already started advancing, and the sound of police sirens could be heard everywhere. Clearly, they were rushing over.</p>
<p>Now, Six-Winged Guardian Dragon is completely famous. I’m afraid that everyone in Luoyang knows about it! Zhou Wen attempted to retrieve the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon time and time again, but he failed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen thought about things too simply. It wasn’t just known by everyone in Luoyang. In fact, the moment the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon activated the black cube, the black cubes around the world lit up and displayed the projection of the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon.</p>
<p>The high-level officials and ordinary people in the various cities of the Federation all looked at the magnificent Six-Winged Guardian Dragon from every angle.</p>
<p>Even those who didn’t see the cube’s screen with their own eyes would have definitely seen all kinds of headlines. Without a doubt, the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon and the cube made the headlines at the same time. It just took a few minutes.</p>
<p>Everyone in the world now knew that there was such a Six-Winged Guardian Dragon.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was feeling anxious, he saw the cube’s screen change again. The projection of the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon vanished, turning into a ranking with a ranking of 1 to 100.</p>
<p>However, the other rankings were all empty. Only the name of the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon appeared at first place. It gave off a feeling of invincibility.</p>
<p>Everyone in the Federation looked at the lone name on the cube. No one knew what was happening or what it represented.</p>
<p>What the hell is this? Zhou Wen was equally puzzled, but he saw that the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s body seemed to have undergone some minute changes amidst the light.</p>
<p>After three minutes, the military and media helicopters rushed over and the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s glow disappeared.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, who had been trying to retrieve the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, finally managed to retrieve it. The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon vanished, and the radiant cube dimmed, turning pure black again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate any further as he escaped stealthily.</p>
<p>Now, Luoyang was in chaos. People were everywhere on the streets and upstairs. All sorts of vehicles and helicopters were everywhere, but no one noticed Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen left, he saw the car An Sheng usually drove. Clearly, he had rushed over as well, but he didn’t know if An Tianzuo was sitting inside.</p>
<p>Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was on his way back when he heard a message from his phone. He opened it and saw that it was from The Thearch.</p>
<p>“I never expected you to have a real Mythical Companion Beast. I’ve underestimated you. Not bad, not bad.”</p>
<p>“That’s not my Companion Beast.” Zhou Wen held back his frustration and denied.</p>
<p>The Thearch did not seem to believe him at all. She sent another message. “I didn’t lie to you. Take a closer look at your Six-Winged Guardian Dragon and see if it has changed. There will be a surprise.”</p>
<p>“I already said that it’s not my Companion Beast.” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback when he heard that. He sent a message to The Thearch before taking out his mysterious phone to check the information on the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon.</p>
<p>With a single glance, he discovered that the information on the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon had indeed undergone a huge change. He took a closer look at the data and was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<h3 id='chapter510'>Chapter 510 Life Protection</h3>
<p>Six-Winged Guardian Dragon: Mythical</p>
<p>Life Providence: Life Guardian Dragon</p>
<p>Life Soul: Wings of Black Flame</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: The Last Life Guardian</p>
<p>Strength: 80</p>
<p>Speed: 80</p>
<p>Constitution: 80</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 80</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Sanctification, Poison Breath, Dragon’s Rage, Hell Demonic Flame, Six Wing Slash.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Holy Flaming Dragon Wings</p>
<p>Zhou Wen remembered that the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s stats were around 60, but now, all of them had become 80. According to the advancement of his Companion Beasts, the top Mythical creatures likely had 81 stat points. Now that the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s stats had reached 80, it could be considered top-notch.</p>
<p>The Life Providence and Wheel of Destiny had slight changes. He had no idea what the word “life” meant, but he believed that it couldn’t be a bad thing.</p>
<p>It gained an additional Sanctification skill, making it have five skills. It was an obvious upgrade. The Demonic Flaming Dragon Wings had been upgraded into Holy Flaming Dragon Wings as well.</p>
<p>“How is it? Are you surprised?” The Thearch sent another message.</p>
<p>Seeing that The Thearch had already determined that the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon was his Companion Beast, he tacitly acknowledged the truth. He asked, “Can a beast be strengthened as long as it’s recognized by the black cube?”</p>
<p>“Dream on. This is a reward for the first Companion Beast that enters the rankings. It happens only once. You lucked out big time.”</p>
<p>Soon, The Thearch sent another message. “However, your Six-Winged Dragon’s potential isn’t good. You should have just used that earring to receive the enhancement. It should have been able to advance to the Mythical stage directly.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t regret not listening to The Thearch. Truth Listener’s advancement to the Mythical stage was indeed good, but Truth Listener was more inclined towards support abilities. What Zhou Wen needed now was actual combat strength.</p>
<p>After the enhancement of the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, its strength would likely increase significantly. It could play a bigger role when fighting Torch Dragon, boosting Zhou Wen’s chances of killing Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s phone rang again, but this time, it wasn’t The Thearch, but a call from An Sheng.</p>
<p>An Sheng and Zhou Wen killed the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon together. He also knew that Zhou Wen had lured Medusa to fight the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon; therefore, he immediately guessed that the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon was Zhou Wen’s.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, what was the situation with the black cube?” An Sheng didn’t beat about the bush with Zhou Wen and directly got straight to the point.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen recounted what he knew, but he skipped the matter regarding The Thearch.</p>
<p>“You mean to say that the cube is actually a ranking for Companion Beasts?” An Sheng thought and asked after hearing that.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, it’s true. However, we can’t rule out the possibility that there’s something else in the black cube. Otherwise, the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon wouldn’t have been strengthened,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>However, An Sheng’s tone became much more relaxed. “That’s good then. The Overseer has been constantly worried about the cube. From the looks of it, it shouldn’t pose a threat any time soon.”</p>
<p>“By the way, congratulations Young Master Wen. You are now the third person in Luoyang to possess a Mythical creature.” An Sheng sighed. “Back when you first came to Luoyang, you were only at the Mortal stage. In less than a year, you even have a Mythical Companion Beast. In terms of speed, even the geniuses of the six families aren’t as fast as you.”</p>
<p>“Who are the other two?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Naturally, it’s Chancellor Leng and the Overseer. If they weren’t here, how could the An family of Luoyang continue standing, to the point of the six families fearing them?” An Sheng said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t ask what their Companion Beasts were. They were the secrets and trump cards of everyone.</p>
<p>After returning to his dorm, Zhou Wen couldn’t wait to summon the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon in its companion form. Six fiery dragon wings appeared behind him, but they weren’t black anymore. Instead, they were pure white. They looked much prettier, but he didn’t know if there were any changes to their effects.</p>
<p>After dispelling the dragon wings, Zhou Wen took out his phone and entered the Zhuolu instance dungeon. He wanted to try and see if the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon could fight Qiongqi.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon had Bright Torch Vision World which ignored strength and speed. However, Qiongqi was a dimensional creature that relied on strength and speed. Now that the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s prowess had greatly increased, it might perhaps put up a fight with Qiongqi.</p>
<p>Taking the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon to the temple where Qiongqi was, the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s originally black body and wings turned white once it saw Qiongqi. It became a white dragon, a likely manifestation of its additional Sanctification skill.</p>
<p>Even though the Six-Winged Dragon was in its Sanctification state, its speed and strength were still inferior to Qiongqi’s. However, it could still barely put up a fight. It was unlike before when it was completely thrashed with no ability to resist at all.</p>
<p>The stronger the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon was, the more Zhou Wen realized how terrifying Qiongqi was. Such a powerful Six-Winged Guardian Dragon was actually suppressed by Qiongqi.</p>
<p>The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon was barely able to put up a fight and didn’t die instantaneously. However, the blood-colored avatar wasn’t that lucky. With Qiongqi suddenly attacking it, Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to dodge twice before it was smacked to death by Qiongqi’s claw.</p>
<p>Something strange happened. The blood-colored avatar was clearly hit, but it didn’t die. Instead, the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s body suddenly exploded as it died for no reason.</p>
<p>With the death of the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, the blood-colored avatar couldn’t last much longer before being killed by Qiongqi.</p>
<p>Could it be that The Last Life Guardian is the miraculous ability to take the master’s place in death? Zhou Wen guessed as he immediately restarted the dungeon and experimented a few more times.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen had guessed, as long as the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon was still alive, it could help him withstand a single death. Furthermore, this ability could also be used even while it was in its dragon wings form.</p>
<p>This enhancement is just too good! Zhou Wen increasingly felt that his choice of doing the enhancement was right. This way, he would have an additional life. Even if he were to die in the future, the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon could still protect him once. This was even more useful than any Mythical creature.</p>
<p>After all, he only had one life. No matter how many Mythical creatures he had, they would be useless once Zhou Wen died.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was studying the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, the six families and some wealthy families were also studying the matter. People from the East and West District even began arguing.</p>
<p>As the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon had appeared in Luoyang, the people of the East District naturally believed that it belonged to an expert in the East District. However, the West District people said that the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon was clearly a Companion Beast of the West District, one that wasn’t available in the East District, so the owner of the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon was definitely a West District citizen who happened to be passing by Luoyang.</p>
<p>The various large families were also guessing who the owner of the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon was. Their main suspects were naturally Leng Zongzheng and An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>However, after many probes and investigations, both of them denied it.</p>
<p>At the same time, the six families were not idle. They were all researching how the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon had appeared on the cube and what its purpose was.</p>
<p>“You mean that the Mythical Six-Winged Guardian Dragon is Zhou Wen’s?” Inside the An family, An Tianzuo’s expression changed when he heard An Sheng’s report.</p>
<h3 id='chapter511'>Chapter 511 Fighting Torch Dragon Again</h3>
<p>“Yes. Back then, Young Master Wen, Zhang Yuzhi, and I killed a Six-Winged Guardian Dragon together. However, it didn’t drop a Companion Egg. Later on, Young Master Wen lured Medusa to fight with the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. The outcome resulted in a Companion Egg. Now that the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon has been strengthened, its combat strength should be considered high among Mythical creatures,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“That’s not necessarily the case. Wild Mythical Companion Beasts are ultimately inferior to those you nurture,” said An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>An Sheng didn’t refute him and only said with a smile, “Overseer, you are right. However, no matter what, that’s a powerful Mythical creature. With it being Young Master Wen’s, he can be considered a cornerstone of our Luoyang City.”</p>
<p>“When did you degenerate to the point of relying on a student? When did our Luoyang City degenerate to the point of relying on a student as a cornerstone?” An Tianzuo glared at An Sheng.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing I can do about that. I also want to be a cornerstone, but I don’t have a Mythical pet,” An Sheng said as he threw up his hands.</p>
<p>“What’s the rush? Isn’t our plan at White Cloud Mountain underway?” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>An Sheng replied, “We still don’t know if we can kill that Mythical creature on White Cloud Mountain. Even if we can kill it, it might not drop a Companion Egg. You killed three or four Mythical creatures previously, but none of them dropped a Companion Egg.”</p>
<p>“That’s because we were unlucky. The chance of Mythical Creatures dropping Companion Eggs is about a third. It should drop one this time.” An Tianzuo glared at him and continued, “In short, we used to rely on ourselves. We rely on ourselves now. It will be the same in the future. Don’t place your hopes on others.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Overseer.” An Sheng paused before asking, “What if Young Master Wen wants to go to Zhuolu? Should I stop him?”</p>
<p>“Does he have the guts? The Mythical creatures at Zhuolu are not something ordinary Mythical Companion Beasts can match. I don’t think he has the guts to go. To obtain a Six-Winged Guardian Dragon is only his luck. Do you really expect him to kill Mythical creatures?” said An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was reading the news in his dorm. Many of the media outlets he saw on his phone listed the appearance of the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon and the cube’s rankings as the headlines.</p>
<p>The entire Federation probably knew about the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon by now.</p>
<p>I wonder what use is a Companion Beast’s ranking? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>The Thearch didn’t mention what the ranking was for, and Zhou Wen didn’t figure out what it could be used for. However, he believed that it wasn’t that simple.</p>
<p>Black cubes had appeared all over the world. Was such a huge formation just to create a useless ranking? Zhou Wen felt that the terrifying existences in the dimensional zones weren’t that bored. The ranking definitely had some use, but he didn’t know what it was yet.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t grind dungeons today. He was considering how he could kill Qiongqi or Torch Dragon. The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon could only just fight Qiongqi, but Zhou Wen wasn’t strong enough. He couldn’t dodge Qiongqi’s attack and instead became a burden. Every time Qiongqi killed the blood-colored avatar, it was useless no matter how strong the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon was.</p>
<p>If he wanted to kill Torch Dragon, he would have to get over the Bright Torch Vision World. The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon could already face Torch Dragon head-on, but it could not block the Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>It’s still harder to kill Qiongqi. I can only continue to think of something regarding Torch Dragon. Zhou Wen thought for a long time before he came up with a method to kill Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon’s speed was much slower than Qiongqi’s. After the strengthening of the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, its speed had already surpassed Torch Dragon’s by a hair’s breadth. It was only because of Bright Torch Vision World that it could not defeat Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>The crystal mirror Zhou Wen had obtained could restrain Torch Dragon, but it was too small. At most, it could only block his face.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Torch Dragon’s eyes were too wide, as if they were growing on both sides. It was impossible to use the crystal mirror to block his vision. The size of the crystal mirror could only block one of its eyes at most.</p>
<p>After some thought, there was only one way to deal with Torch Dragon—that was to transform Six-Winged into dragon wings to boost Zhou Wen’s flying speed. Then, he could use his movement techniques and speed to dodge the Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World gaze, preventing it from seeing him.</p>
<p>Of course, it was impossible to completely dodge it. After all, no matter how fast Zhou Wen was, it was impossible for Torch Dragon to completely miss him.</p>
<p>However, with the crystal mirror, it shouldn’t be difficult to block one angle of its vision. In that case, it gave Zhou Wen enough space. However, it also required repeated experiments in combat. It wasn’t something he could do just by theorizing it. Plans were one thing, but there were often many problems when executing them. He needed to repeatedly test them.</p>
<p>Now, the last problem is how to kill Torch Dragon. After so many battles with Torch Dragon, Zhou Wen realized that its body was even more powerful than the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s. The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s attack could only damage its scales. A small number of attacks would not be of much use. The effects of Overlord Sword’s sword beam wasn’t too obvious.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen decided to rely on the Poison Dragon Palm or Demonic Neonate’s ancient sword to sneak an attack on Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>After figuring out the steps to kill Torch Dragon, Zhou Wen entered the temple again. Before he went to Torch Dragon, he first put on the soft armor formed by the Epic Golden Warrior and the heavy armor formed by the Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior. The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon appeared behind him in the form of dragon wings.</p>
<p>He wore the Truth Listener earring on his ear, holding the Overlord Sword in one hand, and the banana fan in the other.</p>
<p>At the same time, he summoned Demonic Neonate and got her to lie on the blood-colored avatar’s back. Her mission was to constantly search for an opportunity to launch a sneak attack.</p>
<p>Now, the blood-colored avatar was wearing heavy armor with black magma patterns. It had three pairs of holy dragon wings on its back. It had a huge sword in one hand and a banana fan in the other. It looked odd, but it also gave off a powerful feeling.</p>
<p>However, Demonic Neonate, who was lying on its back, instantly reduced that domineering and powerful feeling to only about thirty percent. In general, it felt like a powerful male nanny.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Zhou Wen opened the temple and sent the blood-colored avatar charging in.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon immediately saw him and spat out a mouthful of black smoke. It churned towards the blood-colored avatar like a tidal wave.</p>
<p>After fanning the banana fan a few times, the Grand Yin Wind immediately sent the black smoke back. Without waiting for Torch Dragon to react, the six dragon wings on the blood-colored avatar’s back flapped. Immediately, the blood-colored avatar’s body flashed behind Torch Dragon like a phantom and slashed at Torch Dragon’s neck domineeringly. The sword beam spun violently as it slashed at Torch Dragon like a wheel of light.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon’s reaction wasn’t slow either. It turned its head to look at the sword beam as a flame-like beam shot out from its eyes, shattering it. At the same time, a lash of its gigantic tail left behind afterimages as it struck the blood-colored avatar in midair. Its speed was unbelievable.</p>
<p>The dragon wings flapped as he moved in midair with Ghost Steps, dodging Torch Dragon’s tail attack. At the same time, Overlord Sword slashed out once again, slashing at Torch Dragon’s vital point.</p>
<h3 id='chapter512'>Chapter 512 The Thearch“s Treasure Trove</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen’s figure flashed like a phantom as he dodged left and right. He kept slashing out sword beams, but they were all stopped by Torch Dragon. He ultimately failed to injure it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush. Instead, Torch Dragon was somewhat impatient. Its body emitted waves of energy that radiated through the entire palace, leaving Zhou Wen with no room to dodge.</p>
<p>Holding the Overlord Sword tightly, he unleashed Transcendent Flying Immortal in passing. Sword beams slashed violently and collided with the ripples as both sword beams and ripples shattered.</p>
<p>There were just too many ripples and Transcendent Flying Immortal couldn’t dispatch all of them. When the ripples struck Zhou Wen’s body, they immediately sent him flying as he slammed into a metal pillar in the palace.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that there were many holes in his armor, but his body wasn’t injured. After the first layer of his heavy armor was penetrated by the ripples, the soft armor inside suffered some damage, but it wasn’t completely penetrated.</p>
<p>This armor and soft armor are indeed useful. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be overjoyed. The hard and soft double armor was actually able to withstand Torch Dragon’s attack. It only caused him to receive some shock damage. This was much better than he had expected.</p>
<p>When Torch Dragon saw that the blood-colored avatar wasn’t dead, its eyes immediately flashed. This was the precursor to using Bright Torch Vision World. Zhou Wen abruptly got to his feet and activated Ghost Steps once again. The six wings on his back flapped as he moved behind Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon quickly turned its head and looked in Zhou Wen’s direction. Its eyes had already turned mirror-like.</p>
<p>No matter how fast Zhou Wen’s movement speed was, it wasn’t as fast as its head turning. It was as though Zhou Wen’s figure was about to be caught by the corner of its eye, when he threw the crystal mirror at Torch Dragon’s eye whilst moving.</p>
<p>He originally imagined that the crystal mirror could block Torch Dragon’s line of sight, but to his surprise, Torch Dragon’s cognitive abilities suddenly sped up. The crystal mirror’s trajectory immediately deviated from its eye. The blood-colored avatar was immediately reflected in its eye, and the game screen turned black.</p>
<p>Even the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s Life Guardian Protection was useless. The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon exploded first before the blood-colored avatar died.</p>
<p>Life Guardian Protection was only a transfer of damage. If Zhou Wen was injured, it would be transferred to it, but there was no way for him to leave the Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I still need more practice to block Bright Torch Vision World. Zhou Wen wasn’t discouraged as he continued grinding by dripping his blood and respawning.</p>
<p>He had long expected that it was impossible to succeed in one attempt. It was unknown how many tens of thousands of failures scientists had to undergo before they could produce results. What Zhou Wen was doing was equivalent to experimenting. What he wanted wasn’t luck, but a hundred percent chance of killing Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>Without sufficient confidence, Zhou Wen wouldn’t go to the temple in reality. That would be harming himself and others.</p>
<p>Before fighting Torch Dragon, Zhou Wen would first grind the rare dimensional creatures—Sun Beast, Baby Tiger, Elegant Emperor’s Avatar Puppet, and so on. If a Companion Egg dropped, it would definitely be useful for future fusion.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that if he could combine rare Life Providences, Life Souls, and skills together, he might be able to form a pet that was even crazier than a Mythical pet. However, the difficulty of fusion wasn’t any easier than having a Mythical pet drop. He would need countless attempts.</p>
<p>On the Dead Man Tree, the flower that Ják bloomed after his death finally withered and produced a tiny fruit. It was unknown how long it would take to ripen.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth remained in evolution. It looked like it needed more time to evolve to the Mythical stage than it did when advancing to the Epic stage.</p>
<p>This fellow won’t really become as big as a mountain after advancing to the Mythical stage, right? Zhou Wen was secretly worried. If it was really that big, it wouldn’t be able to enter many dimensional zones.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still grinding dungeons one day when Li Xuan sent the items that he had previously requested. Apart from one chemical, he had bought everything on the list.</p>
<p>There wasn’t much time left until The Thearch’s deadline. After Li Xuan left, Zhou Wen used the Void Flower to teleport the items over. Then, he sent The Thearch a message saying that the material she wanted wasn’t easy to obtain and couldn’t be bought in the nearby cities. If she really wanted it, she would have to wait for some time.</p>
<p>“A month should be enough, right? You must obtain that material.” The Thearch replied.</p>
<p>“I spent a lot of money buying materials. I’m almost running out of money.” Zhou Wen continued complaining. He wasn’t trying to extort her, but he was afraid that The Thearch would think that it was easy for him to obtain these items. That would only serve to her asking him for items every now and then. He didn’t have the time to buy things for her.</p>
<p>“Are you planning on turning into a cat again? The Skill Crystal I gave you is a Mythical Skill Crystal. There aren’t many of those amongst you humans, right? You only bought those few items and you are telling me that you have no money? Do you think I don’t know the price?” The Thearch’s message quickly returned.</p>
<p>Oh no! Zhou Wen still imagined that The Thearch was as easy to fool as before. He had forgotten that she could surf the Internet. She probably had a better understanding of humans than Zhou Wen himself.</p>
<p>“Although a Mythical Skill Crystal is precious, you know the situation of humans now. No one can use it, and there’s no way to price it. It’s really not easy to sell. The crystal is still in my hands. The money to buy these things came from my savings. I really don’t have much left.” Zhou Wen was certain that he wasn’t wrong to say that there was no way to find the price of the Mythical Crystal online.</p>
<p>“That’s true. You humans are too weak and can’t use good stuff. But the worst things I have here are those. There’s no lower level trash.”</p>
<p>The Thearch’s reply nearly made Zhou Wen, who was drinking water, choke.</p>
<p>How many treasures are there in Chess Mountain? Mythic Essence Energy Skill Crystals are only trash? No, I have to think of a way to crack Chess Mountain in the future. Zhou Wen cursed inwardly.</p>
<p>After obtaining Six-Winged, Zhou Wen did indeed have the right to challenge Chess Mountain in the game. Now, he likely had the strength to deal with the fake fairy in Deer Terrace Pavilion, but there wasn’t just one fake fairy inside. If the six of them were to attack together, Zhou Wen didn’t know if he could handle them.</p>
<p>Now that he was focusing on Torch Dragon, he didn’t plan on going just now.</p>
<p>“If it’s not convenient for you to provide payment now, I’ll just sell everything I have. I’ll put it on the tab.” Zhou Wen sent a message.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. Aren’t you in the city not far from Chess Mountain? I’ll tell you a place. Go and look for it. You should be able to find something valuable.” The Thearch was clearly not as petty as Zhou Wen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter513'>Chapter 513 White Cloud Mountain</h3>
<p>“Where is it? It can’t be inside Chess Mountain, right?” Zhou Wen asked warily.</p>
<p>If The Thearch wanted him to enter Chess Mountain in reality, Zhou Wen wouldn’t go no matter what. That place was a huge trap. Zhou Wen guessed that even if the six families took all their Mythical Companion Beasts with them, they might not be able to conquer it.</p>
<p>According to legend, Chaoge was a place with numerous mythical creatures in ancient times. No one knew if those Mythical creatures that had helped Chaoge fight in the war remained inside.</p>
<p>The Seven Saints of Mount Mei, the Four Generals of the Mo family, and so on were extremely terrifying existences even among Mythical creatures. Killing a dragon was too easy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen guessed that if he encountered them, even with the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, he would probably be killed instantly.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. It’s not in Chess Mountain. I’ve seen your present map. That place is in Funiu Mountain. Now, it should be called White Cloud Mountain.” The Thearch seemed to have seen through Zhou Wen’s thoughts.</p>
<p>“White Cloud Mountain is also a dimensional zone, right?” Zhou Wen had heard of White Cloud Mountain before.</p>
<p>White Cloud Mountain and Mount Laojun were part of the Funiu Mountain range, but their positions were somewhat different. Also, the nature of the two was completely different.</p>
<p>Mount Laojun was safer. As long as one didn’t kill or step on any plants, one’s life wouldn’t be in danger.</p>
<p>However, White Cloud Mountain was different. Ever since it transformed into a dimensional zone, the mountain range had been enveloped by clouds. It was faintly discernible like a divine mountain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen heard that only a few people who entered White Cloud Mountain were able to survive. Occasionally, there would be people who could survive, but they would die for no reason a few days later.</p>
<p>According to the people who came out alive, it was very difficult to tell their bearings inside White Cloud Mountain’s fog. Even companions that were inches away would disappear as they walked, never to be seen again alive. Not even their corpses were found.</p>
<p>According to them, they also saw an immortal palace on White Cloud Mountain. That immortal palace wasn’t built on the mountain, but in the clouds. Jade stones were the foundation, and golden stones were on top. There were fairies dancing in the air.</p>
<p>Without exception, those who saw the immortal palace all died in the end. No one survived. Furthermore, when they died, their faces were filled with joy.</p>
<p>Therefore, White Cloud Mountain was also nicknamed the Immortal Ascension Mountain. Anyone who went there would have their lives taken away by an immortal, and they would ascend to the immortal palace to enjoy life.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if they managed to enjoy life, but he didn’t want to die.</p>
<p>“What valuable things can there be in a place that isn’t a dimensional zone? On a peak on the southeast of White Cloud Mountain, there’s a mysterious stone that looks like a rabbit. The good stuff is beneath that mysterious stone,” said The Thearch.</p>
<p>“I heard that White Cloud Mountain is really terrifying. Everyone who goes there dies. I’m afraid that I won’t be able to bring anything back alive,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I’ve already told you where the item is. It’s up to you whether you want to go or not. No matter whether you want to go or not, don’t tell me that you lack money in the future,” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>“Do you have a way to enter White Cloud Mountain?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Close your eyes and enter without looking at anything. That way, nothing will happen,” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>“But how can I find that mysterious rock with my eyes closed?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Is that thing on your ear just for show? Whether you want to go or not, don’t bother me. I’m busy,” The Thearch replied disdainfully.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was depressed. The Thearch even knew Truth Listener’s ability. It looked like he couldn’t fool her.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen checked White Cloud Mountain’s information online and found the place The Thearch had mentioned. That place was rather famous on White Cloud Mountain. When there wasn’t any dimensionalization in the past, it was a scenic spot named Jade Rabbit’s Lunar Prayer.</p>
<p>Legend had it that Jade Rabbit had descended to the mortal world and gone to White Cloud Mountain to have fun. Due to the stunning scenery at White Cloud Mountain, Jade Rabbit forgot the time and missed its opportunity to return to the Moon Palace. It could only watch helplessly as the moon rose from the east, with it never returning. Thus, Jade Rabbit laid on the mountain peak and prayed to the east day after day, hoping that the Moon Palace Fairy would come to take it back to the Moon Palace.</p>
<p>It was only a legend. After the dimensionalization, no one knew what it had become, nor was it known if the Moon Rabbit stone was still there.</p>
<p>The Thearch said that I’ll be fine as long as I don’t open my eyes. This is very beneficial to me. Zhou Wen considered visiting White Cloud Mountain.</p>
<p>The Thearch had casually produced a Mythical Essence Energy Skill Crystal. Zhou Wen felt that it definitely wasn’t an ordinary item if it managed to catch her eye and let her remember it.</p>
<p>In any case, as he had nothing to do on campus, Zhou Wen decided to pay White Cloud Mountain a visit. After all, he could still game and grind dungeons along the way. It wouldn’t affect anything.</p>
<p>The chick and antelope had to be placed in Wang Lu’s care once again. Although Zhou Wen wanted Li Xuan to raise them, the fellow was cultivating so seriously that he far exceeded Zhou Wen’s intensity. He had no time to take care of the two creatures.</p>
<p>As for taking them to White Cloud Mountain, that was impossible. If the chick were to open its eyes and see the immortal palace, it would be dead.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was counting on it to become a fighter when it grew up. He couldn’t let it take the risk so easily.</p>
<p>“How did Little Feifei lose so much weight after you took care of it for two days? Did you torture it?” Wang Lu rolled her eyes at Zhou Wen when she saw the thin chick.</p>
<p>“How would I dare mistreat it? I serve delicious food and drinks all day long. It’s better than what I eat.” Zhou Wen actually found it odd.</p>
<p>The chick was magically thin. After making a trip to Mount Laojun, it lost weight the moment it returned. Zhou Wen suspected that the antelope was up to no good. Back when he was gaming in front of the Wordless Monument, the antelope had taken it to the top of Mount Laojun. It seemed to have lost weight after coming down. He had no idea what they did up there.</p>
<p>“You owe me a lot of lunches and dinners. If this continues, I’m afraid you won’t be able to pay me back even after I graduate.” Wang Lu seriously wrote down the foster care that Zhou Wen required from her in her diary so that she could settle scores with him.</p>
<p>“I’ll pay you back slowly. I’ll be able to pay it all back eventually.” Zhou Wen had no choice. The two of them were dimensional creatures. He was worried that they might cause trouble if he let any ordinary person rear them.</p>
<p>After returning to his dorm, Zhou Wen called An Sheng, asking him to help him apply for a leave of absence for a few days. If he left the school for a longer period of time, the procedures would be more complicated.</p>
<p>Although White Cloud Mountain wasn’t far away, he didn’t know when he would come out once he entered the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>“No problem. I’ll give you a pass. When you return, you can enter and leave the school freely. There’s no need to go to the trouble of applying for a leave of absence every time,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“There’s such a pass?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>“Generally, it’s for postgraduate students. According to the rules, ordinary university students aren’t allowed to have a pass. However, you are naturally an exception. By the way, Young Master Wen, where are you planning to go this time?” An Sheng asked.</p>
<p>“I want to visit White Cloud Mountain.” Zhou Wen and An Sheng had experienced life-and-death situations, so there was naturally no need to hide it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter514'>Chapter 514 Spatial Crystal</h3>
<p>“Why are you going to White Cloud Mountain?” An Sheng was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>“I heard that the dimensional zone there is quite interesting. I would like to pay a visit.” Zhou Wen naturally couldn’t say that he was going there to dig for treasure after hearing what The Thearch had to say.</p>
<p>“White Cloud Mountain is too dangerous. We’ve already been stationed there for a few years, but we still haven’t been able to ascend the Jade Emperor Peak. If you really want to go to White Cloud Mountain, you have to remember that you mustn’t open your eyes after entering. Otherwise, once you see a mirage like the immortal palace, even a Mythical Companion Beast might not be able to save you,” An Sheng said solemnly.</p>
<p>“Why can’t I open my eyes?” Zhou Wen already knew of this taboo, but he never expected An Sheng and company to know about it.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. It’s just like Small Buddha Temple. They have all kinds of unreasonable things. As long as you open your eyes and see it, you will definitely die. There’s no reason at all.”</p>
<p>An Sheng paused for a moment before saying, “You must not go to Jade Emperor Peak either. Even if you close your eyes, you will still be injured by the strange forbidden power there. There will be no way out.”</p>
<p>“I understand. I’m just paying a visit. I might not even enter the mountain.” Zhou Wen asked for more details before realizing that An Sheng and company had a deep understanding of White Cloud Mountain. Apart from Jade Emperor Peak, they had basically figured everything out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that sacrifices were inevitable to gain such a deep understanding of White Cloud Mountain. They weren’t like Zhou Wen, who had the mysterious phone to explore without any scruples. Even if they were all Epic experts, the strangeness of the dimensional zones was impossible to guard against. Once an unforeseen accident happened, Epic experts would easily die as well.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen planned on taking a look first. If he could find the tiny palm symbol, he wouldn’t go up the mountain first. He could download White Cloud Mountain with the tiny palm symbol and use his phone to figure it out before heading up.</p>
<p>With that said, Zhou Wen hesitated for a moment before asking, “How’s the progress on Zhuolu?”</p>
<p>“I knew that you would definitely have your sights on it after you obtained the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. I can tell you with complete certainty that you can only die if you take the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon there.” An Sheng told Zhou Wen some of the things they had recently discovered.</p>
<p>The experts were actually able to determine that the Mythical creatures in the temple were Torch Dragon and Qiongqi. This surprised Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, they could only determine their names. They had no means of conquering the temple. Their understanding of Torch Dragon and Qiongqi was far inferior to Zhou Wen’s. They couldn’t even figure out what abilities Torch Dragon and Qiongqi had.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I can only rely on myself on this trip to the temple, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>“Since you want to go to White Cloud Mountain, wait another two days. I’ll be going to White Cloud Mountain then. I’ll take you along,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in a hurry to go. He felt that going with An Sheng was a good idea. After all, they had already explored the Jade Rabbit’s Lunar Prayer. If he couldn’t find the tiny palm symbol, it would be better for An Sheng to take him up. It was much better than him going up alone and running around blindly.</p>
<p>After making the arrangements with An Sheng, the two ended the call. Zhou Wen picked up his phone and continued grinding the dungeons. They were leaving in two days, so he couldn’t be bothered to collect the chick and antelope. After all, they were happy to be with Wang Lu. The food and drinks there were better than with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>After repeatedly grinding dungeons, Zhou Wen killed a large number of Musical Note Sprites. Now, there were more than a thousand of the seven different Musical Note Sprites. When summoned together, and under the command of the Golden Harp, the sound waves produced from their combined attacks could break through the defenses of the Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior, but they were still far from being able to fight a Mythical creature.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen estimated that he needed at least tens of thousands of Musical Note Sprites. Only then could the sound wave attacks produced be comparable to the strengthened Six-Winged.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in a hurry. After all, he was here to grind the Sun Beast, so he could also grind the Musical Note Sprites along the way. He obtained a few Musical Note Sprite Companion Eggs on each trip.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the Music Temple, the Goldfish didn’t have the Luck attribute, so he could only have his Luck boosted by the baby tiger.</p>
<p>As usual, Zhou Wen came to the musical fountain square. To his surprise, he saw the Golden Harp again.</p>
<p>He had been to the musical fountain square many times, but apart from the first time, he hadn’t discovered the Golden Harp. Zhou Wen imagined that the Golden Harp wouldn’t appear again, so he was quite surprised to see it again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was overjoyed. He immediately ordered the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon to charge forward. The Golden Harp used its powers to make the hundred thousand Musical Note Sprites release a sonic wave, forming a huge sound blast.</p>
<p>However, the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon was no longer the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon from before. It unleashed its full strength. Its six wings appeared at the same time and its body turned white. Its body forcefully broke through the sound blast and arrived in front of the Golden Harp. With a single slap, it shattered the Golden Harp.</p>
<p>Six-Winged has indeed become much stronger. Zhou Wen wasn’t very happy. Even with more than a hundred thousand Musical Note Sprites joining forces, they couldn’t stop the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. If he wanted to form the army of the Musical Note Sprites, he would probably have to obtain at least hundreds of thousands of them before they could play a decisive role in the battle with Mythical creatures.</p>
<p>The Golden Harp didn’t drop a Companion Egg, but a rare spatial stat crystal appeared. It had a Space attribute +3.</p>
<p>This added another rare attribute to Zhou Wen. It was just that three points were not enough.</p>
<p>In the next two days, Zhou Wen spent two days grinding dungeons at home. He had obtained quite a lot of Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior and Golden Warriors, but the Companion Eggs of the baby tiger and the Elegant Emperor’s Avatar Puppet never dropped.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could understand that it was rare for the baby tiger’s Companion Egg to drop, but he never expected the Elegant Emperor’s Avatar Puppet Companion Egg to be that difficult as well. Furthermore, skill crystals seldom dropped as well.</p>
<p>Apart from Zhou Wen obtaining the Substitute Talisman Skill for the first time, no other skill crystal dropped.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, An Sheng called to inform Zhou Wen that they would be heading to White Cloud Mountain. Zhou Wen packed his things, including the Substitute Talisman he had drawn.</p>
<p>When he arrived outside the school and saw An Sheng’s car, he walked to the window and realized that An Tianzuo was sitting in the back seat. He couldn’t help but be slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>Why didn’t Ah Sheng tell me that An Tianzuo would be coming? Zhou Wen found it a little odd, but he couldn’t say anything. All he could do was open the door to the front passenger seat and get in.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had sat in this car many times in the past, but today, he found it odd. The atmosphere in the car just wasn’t right.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo’s eyes were somewhat odd as well. Clearly, he didn’t know that Zhou Wen was going to White Cloud Mountain as well.</p>
<h3 id='chapter515'>Chapter 515 Birth of the Game</h3>
<p>“Young Master Wen, we are going to White Cloud Mountain’s Red Birch Forest to hunt a Mythical creature. Are you interested in joining us?” An Sheng asked as he drove.</p>
<p>“Hunt a Mythical creature?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. This was the first time he had heard of anyone hunting Mythical creatures.</p>
<p>An Sheng said, “That’s right. There’s a strange Mythical creature in Red Birch Forest. We’ve been investigating it for several years. We’ve already done most of the groundwork. We are quite confident this time. Since you’re going to White Cloud Mountain, why don’t you join us? Take it as gaining some experience.”</p>
<p>“I’m fine with that.” Zhou Wen trusted An Sheng very much.</p>
<p>After all, they were hunting Mythical creatures in real life. It was more dangerous, so they would definitely have done more preparatory work. They definitely wouldn’t risk their lives.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even An Tianzuo was taking action this time, so there shouldn’t be much of a problem.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to have too much contact with An Tianzuo. He felt that he and An Tianzuo weren’t the same types of people.</p>
<p>An Sheng continued, “I still don’t know what that Mythical creature in Red Birch Forest is called. We named it Love Letter. It’s rather interesting. Overseer said that if a Companion Egg drops this time, it will belong to me. Perhaps, I will have a Mythical Companion Beast in the future.”</p>
<p>“Love letter? How can there be such a name?” Zhou Wen was somewhat astonished.</p>
<p>“There’s a story behind it. Legend has it that the bark of the red birch tree is very thin and easily removed. Furthermore, it’s very beautiful. Some people will use the bark of the red birch tree to write love letters to their lover. Although the dimensional creature in Red Birch Forest doesn’t look like a book, the skills it uses are related to words. It’s rather difficult to deal with. It’s unknown how many Companion Beasts have died in Red Birch Forest in the past few years just to roughly understand its various skills…”</p>
<p>An Sheng explained quite a bit of the Mythical creature’s abilities before saying, “However, even if we know its abilities, it’s impossible to kill a Mythical creature without the same powers at the Mythical stage. Therefore, Overseer has to personally take action this time. Otherwise, I won’t be able to handle it myself. If you go with me, I’ll be even more at ease. It’s a good thing that both experts from Luoyang will be helping me kill a dimensional creature.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen really didn’t wish to have any nice stories of him and An Tianzuo, but he couldn’t say anything uncultured. All he could do was remain silent.</p>
<p>“The mountain road is dangerous. Drive carefully,” An Tianzuo, who was sitting behind with his eyes closed, said coldly.</p>
<p>“Yes,” An Sheng replied. Indeed, he didn’t dare say another word. He secretly winked at Zhou Wen before focusing on driving.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no interest in speaking. Just as he was about to close his eyes to rest, he suddenly heard his phone ring.</p>
<p>Seeing that it was Huang Ji who called, Zhou Wen answered the call.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, our game is done.” Huang Ji’s excited voice sounded. Even An Sheng and An Tianzuo heard it.</p>
<p>After the trial run the previous time, Zhou Wen didn’t have much anticipation for Huang Ji’s game. However, he still acted interested and said, “That’s great. Can you send me a copy? I can’t wait to try it.”</p>
<p>“Of course. I’ve already posted it online to begin the closed beta test. Go download this website and give me some suggestions after you’re done playing.” Huang Ji quickly sent a website address to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen opened the page and saw that it was a gaming website. It was filled with closed and open beta games. Their game was called “Dimension.” Zhou Wen saw the game at the top.</p>
<p>It was not because Huang Ji spent money that pushed his ranking so high, but because Huang Ji had just uploaded it. That made it appear at the top.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly downloaded the game. Thankfully, this wasn’t a dimensional zone, or there might not be a signal. They had just arrived in the suburbs, so the signal was pretty good.</p>
<p>After a while, Zhou Wen finished downloading the game and launched it. He realized that although the login interface was very simple, it wasn’t bad. It looked rather good.</p>
<p>After entering the game, Zhou Wen chose Tiger Cage Pass which was the only option. When he entered the game, he couldn’t help but be surprised.</p>
<p>He had originally thought that the game Huang Ji had created was the standard 2D side-scrolling game. But now, it was completely different from when he trialed it.</p>
<p>Even though it was a 2D side-scrolling game, both the NPCs and the details of the scenery had greatly improved. However, there were only two choices for characters—man or woman. After choosing a man, there was no skill selection interface like before. Instead, he entered a game tutorial interface.</p>
<p>The tutorial introduced the game’s operations and skill usage. Apart from the direction key, there were also five buttons in-game. Then, the direction key and the other five buttons could be used in different key combinations for different skills. There were ten skills available in-game. After remembering the method to deliver an attack, he could use the skills he needed.</p>
<p>It’s done pretty well! Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised. He tried the maneuvering, and it was surprisingly fluid. It was similar to the popular fighting games in the past. The controls and feedback were a rather good experience.</p>
<p>After entering the game, Tiger Cage Pass became a black-and-white ink style. Demonic Soldiers were the same style as well. It looked surprisingly immersive. Zhou Wen controlled the game character to kill the Demonic Soldiers in Tiger Cage Pass and discovered that the various techniques and attacks of Demonic Soldiers were very similar to real ones. They were much more agile than when he tried the alpha. There was some difficulty.</p>
<p>This… It’s really not bad… Zhou Wen played for a while before becoming more and more surprised. This was far from what he had imagined. It was surprisingly good.</p>
<p>Although playing games might not necessarily mean one could kill Demonized Soldiers, one could familiarize themselves with the various means of attack by the Demonized Soldiers in-game. They could learn how to deal with them when encountering them in real life. To rookies who had not entered Tiger Cage Pass, it was quite helpful. It was much better than learning from videos.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stormed through the game and killed quite a number of Demonized Soldiers. The controls weren’t a problem for him. He only took a brief look at them before he was able to cast all sorts of skills smoothly. Killing Demonized Soldiers was very easy.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen discovered the mini-boss, Demonized General. After engaging in an intense battle with the Demonized General, he found the game pretty good. The Demonized General’s behavior and skills were replicated very well, similar to the real Demonized General.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gamed the entire time. Behind him, An Tianzuo had been resting with his eyes closed. When he heard Zhou Wen gaming, he couldn’t help but open his eyes and frown.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo clearly didn’t like Zhou Wen playing games all day. From his point of view, this was a form of obsession.</p>
<p>An Sheng was an extremely clever person. When he saw An Tianzuo frown through the rearview mirror, he knew that things were bad. Hence, he said, “Young Master Wen, I heard that you and your classmates worked together to create a game that can be used to teach people about the various abilities of dimensional creatures. Is that it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, production was just completed. It’s my first time playing the closed beta. Currently, there’s only a Tiger Cage Pass dungeon. In-game, there are Demonized Soldiers and Demonized Generals as monsters and one can learn their behaviors and various skills through gaming. Through learning about how to deal with them in-game, it will be useful in real life, but games are games after all; one still needs to practice the combination of various skills in combat,” Zhou Wen introduced.</p>
<p>“That’s pretty good. Overseer, why don’t you play the game that Zhou Wen and company created? If it’s feasible, it’ll be helpful in understanding dimensional creatures. Perhaps it can be promoted,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“A game is just a game after all. If you have the time to play games, why don’t you just spend time watching a video about it?” An Tianzuo closed his eyes again and continued resting.</p>
<h3 id='chapter516'>Chapter 516 Blood Text Scorpion</h3>
<p>After arriving at White Cloud Mountain’s encampment, the person-in-charge took An Tianzuo, An Sheng, and Zhou Wen to White Cloud Mountain. An Tianzuo didn’t have much time, so he had to rush back regardless of whether they killed the Mythical creature today.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at White Cloud Mountain from afar and saw clouds lingering over it. The mountain was partially visible. It was indeed like a legendary immortal mountain.</p>
<p>There were many red birch forests. The Mythical creature was at the foot of White Cloud Mountain, so there was no need to ascend the mountain.</p>
<p>However, it was also within the range of Baiyun Mountain. There was also a chance to see the unusual sight of the immortal palace in the clouds.</p>
<p>“If we continue moving forward, we might end up in an immortal palace illusion. Put this on.” An Sheng handed Zhou Wen a balaclava.</p>
<p>The balaclava was made of chemical fibers mixed with metal wires. After wearing it, it wouldn’t affect one’s breathing, but one’s vision was blocked and it was impossible to see anything outside.</p>
<p>“No matter what you hear or what happens, make sure not to take off the balaclava.” An Sheng put his balaclava on after giving Zhou Wen the rules.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo and the officers from the other encampments also wore balaclavas. They had their own methods. Some relied on their special Companion Beasts for visual, while some relied on their hearing. Some rode their mounts directly, allowing them to replace their eyes.</p>
<p>An Sheng summoned a strange Companion Beast. The Companion Beast looked like a large eye with wings. It flew beside An Sheng and seemingly allowed him to see his surroundings. It was no different from normal.</p>
<p>As for An Tianzuo, he didn’t summon a Companion Beast, nor was it clear what he had used. However, the balaclava didn’t seem to affect his vision. He still moved as freely.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had Truth Listener, so he wasn’t affected.</p>
<p>The group followed an officer riding a Companion Beast into the depths of the red birch Forest.</p>
<p>White Cloud Mountain was mysterious, but there weren’t many dimensional creatures here. However, every dimensional creature that appeared here was extremely terrifying. At the very least, they were Epic creatures.</p>
<p>Rumor had it that the red birch forest was very beautiful, but since Zhou Wen could only listen and not see color, he did not think it looked beautiful.</p>
<p>“Overseer, the Earth Listener Beast has reacted. Love Letter should be somewhere not far ahead,” an officer riding on a Companion Beast suddenly said.</p>
<p>“Prepare for battle.” An Tianzuo gave the order.</p>
<p>Apart from Zhou Wen, everyone began preparing for battle. After advancing for a short while, Zhou Wen heard a dimensional creature appear in front of him.</p>
<p>The dimensional creature looked very strange. It looked like a large scorpion, but it had transparent wings on its back. It was huge and longer than an adult’s height.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen could only hear and couldn’t see its color. Otherwise, he would have discovered many strange things.</p>
<p>The large scorpion was snow-white, but there were many blood-colored patterns on its body. If one looked carefully, they would see that those blood-colored patterns formed strange characters.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen and company discovered the strange scorpion, it had also discovered them. With a flick of its tail, a blood-colored glow immediately appeared on the stinger, forming a strange blood-colored incantation pattern. The incantation pattern was completely condensed from light and looked very magical.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had heard from An Sheng that this fellow had the ability to produce many things that resembled words. This was likely one of them, but Zhou Wen didn’t know which one it was.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was pondering, An Sheng and company had already begun preparing for battle. However, contrary to Zhou Wen’s expectations, the blood text on the scorpion’s tail didn’t shoot at Zhou Wen and company. All he saw was its tail stabbing into the ground as the blood text fused into the ground before disappearing.</p>
<p>At that instant, Zhou Wen saw the ground around him suffuse a blood-colored glow. The soil seemed to have been penetrated by the sanguine light as it emitted a lustrous red glow.</p>
<p>The red beams varied in intensity, making Zhou Wen believe that he was in a huge light formation.</p>
<p>The officers were clearly prepared. A Companion Beast beneath an officer raised its legs and condensed a holy white light. Then, it stomped on the ground. The holy light immediately spread out and covered the red light below, preventing the area where Zhou Wen and company were standing from being affected.</p>
<p>A strange phenomenon happened in the area that was affected by the red light. It was as if everything had slowed down. When the wind blew past the red birch forest, the forest that should have been rustling seemed to be a recording that played slowly. As the leaves swayed, it became extremely slow.</p>
<p>“This is its Slow Text. If we don’t have the corresponding counterforce, our speed will drop drastically. When the time comes, we won’t be able to dodge its attack, much less kill it. We will be killed,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>As though he had discovered that the Slow Text was useless against them, a blood pattern flickered on the scorpion-like Mythical Creature’s back as a blood-colored text rushed out. The blood-colored text wasn’t directed at Zhou Wen and company but towards a red birch tree.</p>
<p>The blood-red text hit the red birch tree and disappeared in a flash. It was as though it had drilled into the tree. In the next second, the tree withered rapidly and died. The blood-red text flew out from the withered tree. However, the blood-red text had clearly changed. Its shape had changed, and the blood-colored light had also become more intense.</p>
<p>The blood-colored text floated above the scorpion and emitted a red light. Wherever the red light shone, all the red birch trees seemed to come alive. The roots broke out of the ground and the branches swayed as they swept towards Zhou Wen and company like tree demons.</p>
<p>A cold light flickered on the back of an officer, and an Ice Fox-like Life Soul appeared. An icy beam erupted from the Life Soul, freezing the nearby demonized red birch trees.</p>
<p>An Sheng no longer had the time to explain to Zhou Wen. The scorpion’s body emitted a sanguine light as red words flew out from its body, transforming into streaks of blood that attacked Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>An Sheng and a few officers collectively resisted the blood beams. An Tianzuo watched from the side, having no intention of attacking from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could roughly tell that the scorpion’s strength was about the same as Six-Winged before it was strengthened, but its abilities were rather strange.</p>
<p>Its blood-red text had many functions. Other than the few that he had seen, it could also transform into the power of wind, fire, lightning, and so on.</p>
<p>If one were to encounter it the first time, or if they were not strong enough, they would easily be killed by it.</p>
<p>However, An Sheng and company had studied it for years. They had already thought of ways to counter its various powers. No matter how it changed its abilities, they could barely contain them.</p>
<p>However, they had just managed to resolve it. Up to now, Zhou Wen had yet to see how they could kill the scorpion.</p>
<h3 id='chapter517'>Chapter 517 Failure</h3>
<p>An Sheng’s personal abilities were definitely top-notch at the Epic stage. However, even he couldn’t approach the scorpion. The scorpion’s speed was too fast. With a flap of its wings, it could easily fly hundreds of meters away. Even Zhou Wen probably couldn’t catch up to it easily with Ghost Steps.</p>
<p>After repeatedly resolving the blood-colored text of wind, fire, and lightning, An Sheng and company seemed to have found an opportunity to counterattack. With An Sheng’s command, the officers unleashed their strongest attack as terrifying forces struck the scorpion.</p>
<p>There was a sanguine flash on the scorpion’s back as a huge blood-red text appeared. It was like a shield that blocked their attacks.</p>
<p>With a series of crashing sounds, their forces were shattered, but the blood-colored barrier remained completely fine.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo, who had remained motionless all this while, finally made a move. Flames rose over his body, turning into a strange Life Soul.</p>
<p>The Life Soul’s entire body was covered in white armor. The armor was neither gold nor jade. It looked more like it was carved from bones.</p>
<p>Behind him was a blood-red cape. In his left hand was a slender bone saber covered in blood patterns. In his other hand was a gun made of bones.</p>
<p>That thing… It can’t be a Gatling, right… Zhou Wen looked at the weapon in the Life Soul’s hand. The bone gun barrel was connected to the recoil mechanism. It looked like an ancient hot weapon that was often seen in movies.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, he heard a terrifying boom. He saw the bone gun barrel shoot out blood-colored bullets like a storm.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Bullets rained down on the scorpion’s blood-red text barrier, causing it to flicker as though it could shatter at any moment.</p>
<p>Buzzing sounds could be heard as the bullets poured freely. The bloody text barrier of the scorpion shattered.</p>
<p>This was the first time Zhou Wen had seen someone’s Life Soul produce a hot weapon. Furthermore, its attack was crazy powerful. It could actually break through a Mythical-stage barrier.</p>
<p>Although it was only a rather weak Mythical creature, Zhou Wen had relied on Ever-Victorious’s characteristic to kill Medusa. His Life Soul alone wasn’t that powerful.</p>
<p>The bullet hit the scorpion’s body, instantly infuriating it. The wings on its back spread open, and there was a blood-red glow on its wings. Its entire body was covered in blood-red light, and the blood-red symbol at the tip of its tail appeared especially terrifying.</p>
<p>The blood text circled around the scorpion’s body and kept spinning, blocking the rain of bullets.</p>
<p>When the bullets struck the blood text, they created a terrifying explosive shockwave that blasted the surrounding forest into pieces.</p>
<p>“Activate the halo,” An Sheng instructed the officers.</p>
<p>Two of the officers’ Companion Beasts shimmered with light as they enveloped An Tianzuo’s body. It caused An Tianzuo and his Life Soul’s bodies to emit two strange beams of light. The Gatling’s attacks became more ferocious as it pumped bullets at a denser and more powerful rate.</p>
<p>“Activate the curse.” An Sheng also used an Essence Energy Skill when he issued the order. He produced a strange gray smoke that enveloped the scorpion.</p>
<p>The other officers also used various powers. Those powers did not have any lethality, but they had a slight effect on the scorpion.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The scorpion was furious after being bombarded by the Gatling’s attacks. The blood-red text surrounding it exploded with a terrifying sanguine light. Almost instantly, it engulfed everything nearby.</p>
<p>“Retreat.” An Sheng issued an order before the blood text exploded.</p>
<p>All the officers retreated with An Sheng in a great display of teamwork. Zhou Wen followed them and retreated, but he realized that An Tianzuo didn’t retreat.</p>
<p>The expanding sanguine light resembled a blood-colored black hole, devouring everything nearby. An Tianzuo was already standing at the edge of the blood hole, about to be devoured.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was frowning when he suddenly saw An Tianzuo’s Life Soul vanish. As for An Tianzuo, he had a white bone armor and a blood cape. He held a bone saber in one hand and a bone Gatling in the other.</p>
<p>Just when the sanguine light was about to devour him, a black figure flew out from his body and landed on the bone blade. Instantly, a demonic black flame rose on the bone blade.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo raised his bone saber and slashed at the sanguine light in front of him. He managed to cleave open a rift as he charged in.</p>
<p>Gunfire roared and saber flames flashed. An Tianzuo fought the scorpion crazily. The madness was completely different from the usual An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>As for An Sheng and company, they constantly used various Essence Energy Skills from behind. They either aimed at An Tianzuo or at the scorpion. The only officer with the Ice Fox Life Soul and the ability to restrain the Slow Text was the busiest. They needed to constantly pump out damage to ensure that An Tianzuo’s region wasn’t affected by the power of the Slow Text.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The scorpion’s body was sent flying by a backslash from An Tianzuo’s bone saber. An Tianzuo raised the Gatling with his hand. The black flames on the bone saber instantly shifted to the bone Gatling before enveloping it.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Bullets with black flames roared towards the scorpion in midair, causing its body to constantly distort and rise in the air. In the end, its carapace was cracked by the bullets, and more and more bullets shot into its flesh and blood. The black flames also burned its flesh and bones.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The blood patterns on the scorpion shattered and fell like glass.</p>
<p>“Success!” An Sheng was overjoyed.</p>
<p>Without the protection of the blood patterns, the storm-like bullets bombarded the scorpion wantonly. The carapace of the scorpion was completely shattered and blood spurted out.</p>
<p>Just as the scorpion’s body was about to explode, a blood-red light suddenly erupted from its abdomen. A strange blood text surfaced, and the blood quickly spread over the scorpion’s body.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The sanguine light exploded as its carapace and flesh transformed into a terrifying energy blast. An Tianzuo had no choice but to retreat.</p>
<p>At the same time the explosion occurred, a sanguine light from the scorpion’s body flew toward White Cloud Mountain at an unbelievable speed.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo’s body flashed as he chased in the direction of White Cloud Mountain.</p>
<p>“Damn it, that fellow actually has such a move!” An Sheng cursed under his breath as he chased with his men.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen chased after him as well. When they caught up to An Tianzuo, they realized that he was standing in front of the mountain entrance. The scorpion that had self-destructed was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>“Love Letter escaped into Jade Emperor Peak?” An Sheng had already guessed what was going on.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo nodded slightly. “We have failed. Let’s head back.”</p>
<p>They knew that the scorpion was no longer able to survive; it was definitely on its last legs. As long as they could find it, even without An Tianzuo’s help, An Sheng could kill it himself.</p>
<p>However, no one dared to enter Jade Emperor Peak. No matter how strong a person was, entering would only lead to death. Even An Tianzuo could only return empty-handed.</p>
<p>Mythical creatures were precious, but they couldn’t trade for one with their lives.</p>
<h3 id='chapter518'>Chapter 518 Companion Egg Inside</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to listen to the area beyond the mountain entrance. He found it dead silent. Unable to hear a thing, it was as though the particles inside were motionless, having not generated any vibrations.</p>
<p>Jade Emperor Peak is indeed terrifying. It’s such a pity. They prepared for so long, but all their efforts were in vain at the final moment. Zhou Wen felt sorry for An Sheng. If a Mythical Companion Egg dropped, An Sheng’s strength would definitely improve greatly. It would be much safer for him to carry out missions in the future.</p>
<p>Along the way, Zhou Wen didn’t find the tiny palm symbol. Although Truth Listener’s ability couldn’t hear the scene around him, he could hear the traces of carvings. If there was a tiny palm symbol, he should have heard it.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo was a decisive person. Since all hope was lost, he did not hesitate to order An Sheng and the officers to leave White Cloud Mountain with him.</p>
<p>Just as they were about to leave, they suddenly heard a miserable scream coming from Jade Emperor Peak. It sounded like a creature’s death cry.</p>
<p>“It’s Love Letter. It died less than twenty meters away from Jade Emperor Peak. It even dropped a Companion Egg,” an officer suddenly shouted.</p>
<p>“How do you know?” An Tianzuo asked.</p>
<p>“I can’t hear it, but I can see it with my eyes. It’s inside. It’s a Companion Egg the size of a football and it resembles white jade. It has blood-colored text on it.” The officer had used his hearing, but he couldn’t hear anything. As he was unwilling to give up, he thought that it would be fine if he stole a glance. He removed his balaclava and had looked inside—seeing the Companion Egg.</p>
<p>“An Sheng?” An Tianzuo had also used his hearing ability but he couldn’t see the situation inside.</p>
<p>This was because An Sheng’s large-eyed Companion Beast gave him the ability of sight. If anyone could see it, An Sheng would be the first, but An Sheng hadn’t said anything.</p>
<p>“Even if it’s twenty meters, it’s within the confines of Jade Emperor Peak. It’s no different from two hundred meters or two thousand meters,” An Sheng answered.</p>
<p>He was obviously the first person to discover the blood scorpion, but he did not say anything. Even though it was right in front of him, he still chose to give up.</p>
<p>With that said, An Sheng said to the officer, “Old He, put on the balaclava. Are you tired of living?”</p>
<p>“Overseer, Adjutant, why don’t we make an attempt? It’s less than twenty meters inside. Perhaps there’s a way to get the Companion Egg out. That’s a Mythical Companion Egg.” The officer put on the balaclava and said to An Tianzuo and An Sheng, unwilling to give up.</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng is right. It doesn’t matter even if it’s two centimeters within Jade Emperor Peak, much less twenty meters,” said An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>“Overseer, let’s try using Companion Beasts. At most, we will sacrifice a few Companion Beasts. We can still afford to lose them.” The officers felt that it was a pity to leave.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to try. Haven’t we done enough experiments in the past? You can’t enter the Jade Emperor Peak, regardless if they are humans or Companion Beasts. The outcome is the same,” Ah Sheng objected firmly.</p>
<p>“Overseer, I have a Companion Beast that I obtained in a dimensional zone previously. It’s called Evil Warding Spirit Rhinoceros. It has the ability to resist evil powers, so why not let it try? If Adjutant An can obtain a Mythical pet, it’ll be a boon for our Sunset Army. In the future, fewer of our brothers will die when we carry out missions…” one of the officers said.</p>
<p>“Then give it a try,” said An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Overseer.” The officer was instantly overjoyed.</p>
<p>“Overseer…” An Sheng wanted to stop him.</p>
<p>“If we don’t let them try, they won’t be willing to give up. Just remember this.” An Tianzuo stopped An Sheng from continuing.</p>
<p>As they were speaking, Zhou Wen circled around the mountain entrance. He wanted to see if there was a tiny palm symbol nearby. He didn’t have much hope because the tiny palm symbol was typically engraved on a more conspicuous spot. It wasn’t on the mountain entrance, so the chances of there being one were rather low.</p>
<p>But he didn’t expect to find the tiny palm symbol on a mountain rock to the east of the mountain entrance.</p>
<p>The tiny palm symbol was engraved on a mountain rock that was about the height of a person. It was unknown what color the mountain rock was, but its shape was nothing special. The tiny palm symbol engraved on it was a small hand holding a small mountain-shaped rock.</p>
<p>He took out his phone and took a picture of the small palm symbol.</p>
<p>The phone quickly locked onto the picture and entered the download interface.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the officer had already summoned a moon-white rhinoceros. The rhinoceros looked very mighty, and it was much bigger than an ordinary rhinoceros. It was even bigger than an adult elephant. Its body was glowing with a jade glow, as though its body was enveloped by moonlight.</p>
<p>“Old He, don’t bother. It’s a pity to lose a precious Companion Beast like the Evil Warding Spirit Rhinoceros,” An Sheng said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. It’s less than twenty meters away. It’s just one step of the Evil Warding Spirit Rhinoceros.” Old He was determined. When the Evil Warding Spirit Rhinoceros stood in front of the stone entrance, Old He gave the order and the Evil Warding Spirit Rhinoceros moved like a tank charging through the entrance. It headed straight for the spot where the Companion Egg had dropped.</p>
<p>After it entered, Zhou Wen couldn’t hear the Evil Warding Spirit Rhinoceros. He thought that since there wasn’t any immortal palace phenomenon, he could take a look at the situation without looking up into the fog.</p>
<p>He lifted the balaclava a little so that he could see the situation at the mountain entrance. He saw the Evil Warding Spirit Rhinoceros’s body four to five meters away from the mountain entrance. Furthermore, it was still charging at high speed. With such a speed, it would only take a few seconds to traverse twenty meters.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also saw the Companion Egg. Indeed, it was less than twenty meters away from the mountain entrance. Just as Old He had said, there were blood-colored patterns on the jade-white egg. There was a pile of blood-colored powder on the ground. It was likely formed after the Blood Scorpion died.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was sizing up the Evil Warding Spirit Rhinoceros, he saw a terrifying scene. After the huge rhinoceros rushed past the mountain entrance, its body turned into a piece of jade. It didn’t get far—perhaps ten meters—before the entire rhinoceros turned into a lifeless jade statue and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>After a loud bang, the Evil Warding Spirit Rhinoceros shattered into pieces of jade. Furthermore, the pieces of jade that landed on the ground kept disintegrating, becoming smaller and smaller. Like sand, they split apart and finally turned to dust.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but shiver. He finally knew what was going on with the pile of blood-colored powder beneath the Companion Egg. Even the Blood Scorpion couldn’t withstand the terrifying power from Jade Emperor Peak. It had ended up in the same state as the Evil Warding Spirit Rhinoceros.</p>
<p>However, the Companion Egg wasn’t affected by the terrifying force.</p>
<p>Ding! Zhou Wen’s phone notified the completion of the download. He looked down and saw a black mountain icon on the screen. However, it wasn’t White Cloud Mountain but Demon Suppression Mountain.</p>
<h3 id='chapter519'>Chapter 519 Zero Taboo</h3>
<p>After tapping open the Demon Suppression Mountain dungeon, he realized that the blood-colored avatar had appeared in front of the black stone. Beside it was White Cloud Mountain’s entrance. Other than the cartoon image, the layout was identical to the real White Cloud Mountain.Zhou Wen thought for a moment and attempted to let the blood-colored avatar enter the mountain entrance. He wanted to see if Truth Listener’s ability could withstand the terrifying power of Jade Emperor Peak.</p>
<p>However, it was useless. The power on Jade Emperor Peak wasn’t an evil force like a curse. After a few steps, the blood-colored avatar turned to dust.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and dripped his blood to revive. He walked into Jade Emperor Peak once again, but this time, he switched his Essence Energy Art to a Dao Art.</p>
<p>His Life Providence had naturally transformed into a Dao Body and Zero Taboo.</p>
<p>The moment the blood-colored avatar took half a step in, the Zero Taboo crystal in his consciousness lit up like a light bulb.</p>
<p>It works! Zhou Wen was delighted as he controlled the blood-colored avatar to continue walking forward. After taking a few steps, his body was fine. Cracks began to appear on the Zero Taboo crystal, as though it was about to shatter.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It really can’t be taken out. In front of the mountain entrance, Old He wore a look of disappointment. He wasn’t sad for the death of his Evil Warding Spirit Rhinoceros, but because he couldn’t retrieve the Companion Egg for An Sheng.</p>
<p>“Old He, with the Overseer around, we will have plenty of chances to kill Mythical creatures in the future. It’s just a matter of time,” An Sheng said. He found it a pity that the Evil Warding Spirit Rhinoceros died. It was one of the few Epic Companion Beasts that could ward off evil. It was a pity to lose it.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.” An Tianzuo gave another order. This time, no one said a word. Although they were unwilling to give up on the Mythical Companion Egg in front of them, they had no choice but to leave.</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng, let me give it a try. Perhaps I can take it out,” Zhou Wen said as he walked over.</p>
<p>If the Companion Egg was An Tianzuo’s, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have stepped forward. He might even have waited for them to leave before secretly returning to retrieve the Companion Egg.</p>
<p>However, the Companion Egg was for An Sheng, so Zhou Wen felt that he should help.</p>
<p>An Sheng had given him plenty of help and had risked his life with him. He had plenty of chances to obtain Mythical Companion Eggs in the future, but it was unlikely to have someone willing to risk his life for him at critical moments.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, if you wish to use a Mythical Companion Beast to take the Companion Egg, there’s no need to bother. Love Letter is also at the Mythical stage. It also failed to withstand the power of Jade Emperor Peak,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“If I just want to take out the Companion Egg, it’s very simple. I don’t need to use a Mythical Companion Beast.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he walked to the mountain entrance and deliberately sounded relaxed. He didn’t say that he was the one entering.</p>
<p>This was because he knew very well that if he said that he was the one entering, An Sheng would have definitely stopped him. It was impossible that he would let him take the risk.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, what solution do you have?” An Sheng asked.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo and the officers looked at Zhou Wen. They also wanted to know if he really had a way to bring out the Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Old He looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Young Master Wen, if you have a way to bring out the Companion Egg, just let me know if there’s anything I can do in the future. I’ll be at your beck and call.”</p>
<p>An Sheng had saved the lives of Old He’s family. Old He had always treated An Sheng’s matters as his own.</p>
<p>“I’ll remember that.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he looked past the mountain entrance. An Tianzuo and company believed that he would summon a Companion Beast, but to their surprise, Zhou Wen suddenly took a step forward and walked through the mountain pass.</p>
<p>“No…” An Sheng turned pale with fright as he rushed towards the mountain entrance.</p>
<p>Someone was faster than him as he appeared in front of the mountain entrance in a flash. He extended his hand to grab Zhou Wen, but he was still a step slower. Zhou Wen had already rushed past the mountain entrance.</p>
<p>When An Sheng rushed to the mountain entrance, he was held back by An Tianzuo, who had arrived a step earlier. He didn’t let him chase after Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Look carefully. His body isn’t affected,” An Tianzuo said to An Sheng in a deep voice as he took off his balaclava.</p>
<p>Old He and company were also alarmed. They originally imagined that Zhou Wen would use a special Companion Beast to make the attempt, they never expected him to walk in by himself.</p>
<p>An Sheng stood outside the stone door and looked at Zhou Wen inside. He quickly walked towards the Companion Egg. His speed was astonishing. More importantly, his body didn’t disintegrate like the Evil Warding Spirit Rhinoceros.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body landed in front of the Companion Egg like a wisp of smoke. He reached out and scooped the Companion Egg into his hand before turning around and retreating.</p>
<p>This back-and-forth was swift and elegant, like a swift saber that had been unsheathed. With a flash, the saber had already returned into the sheath before one could see what the blade looked like.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen returned to the mountain entrance with the Blood Scorpion Companion Egg in hand, Old He and company jolted to attention as though they had been in a dream. They speechlessly looked at Zhou Wen who was standing in front of them in perfect condition.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, you are really too rash.” An Sheng sized up Zhou Wen’s body and only heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that there wasn’t anything wrong with his body.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I won’t do anything that I’m not confident of.” Zhou Wen threw the Companion Egg to An Sheng.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, thank you,” An Sheng received the Companion Egg and said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Not considering the consequences of your actions will one day make you pay the price. Put on your balaclavas and we will head down the mountain,” An Tianzuo said coldly. He put his balaclava on and turned to head down the mountain.</p>
<p>Everyone hurriedly put on their balaclavas and followed An Tianzuo down the mountain.</p>
<p>When they reached a fork on the mountainside, Zhou Wen asked An Sheng, “Ah Sheng, is Jade Rabbit’s Lunar Prayer on the mountain over there?”</p>
<p>“It’s there alright. I’ll take you there,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Old He also said, “Young Master Wen, if you want to pay a visit, I’ll take you there. However, it’s just a stone. There’s nothing to see.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need. There’s no danger there anyway. I just want to take a look myself. You guys can go back now,” Zhou Wen said as he walked up the mountain path.</p>
<p>An Sheng didn’t insist on going with him. Since Zhou Wen could remain unharmed in Jade Emperor Peak, nothing outside posed a danger to him.</p>
<p>“Adjutant An, this Young Master Wen is amazing. He actually managed to enter and exit Jade Emperor Peak safely. He’s really strong. Is he still in school?” Old He asked An Sheng as he watched Zhou Wen disappear on the mountain path.</p>
<p>“Don’t you know whose family Young Master Wen is from? How can a person who can be doted on so much by Madam not be strong?” As An Sheng spoke, he used his large eyes to glance at An Tianzuo, but unfortunately, he couldn’t see An Tianzuo’s expression through the balaclava.</p>
<p>“You’re right. Young Master Wen is Madam Lan’s son. It’s only right for him to be strong.” Old He smiled.</p>
<h3 id='chapter520'>Chapter 520 One Takes on the Color of One“s Company</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen walked all the way up to the mountain where Jade Rabbit’s Lunar Prayer was. Although Zero Taboo seemed to have the ability to counter White Cloud Mountain’s taboo powers, Zhou Wen still wore the balaclava and used Truth Listener’s ability to scout the way.</p>
<p>If he were to see the immortal palace phenomenon, it would be quite an unjust death in the event Zero Taboo failed to work.</p>
<p>There were indeed very few dimensional creatures on White Cloud Mountain. Zhou Wen walked all the way to the peak, but he didn’t even encounter a single one.</p>
<p>After reaching the top of the mountain, Zhou Wen finally saw the legendary jade rabbit’s lunar prayer stone. Perhaps it was because Zhou Wen’s imagination wasn’t good, but no matter how he looked at it, it didn’t resemble a rabbit.</p>
<p>The Thearch said that the item is beneath this stone, but this stone seems to be connected to the mountain? Should I dig it up? Zhou Wen circled the Moon Rabbit stone but didn’t find the good stuff that The Thearch had mentioned.</p>
<p>Although it wasn’t nice to destroy a natural landscape, Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered anymore. He summoned the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon and made it push the Moon Rabbit stone to see if there was anything below.</p>
<p>The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon had 80 Strength after all. With the augmentation of an Essence Energy Skill, it could snap the mountain, much less a mere rock.</p>
<p>However, it was unable to move the Moon Rabbit stone at all despite using all its might.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be surprised. With the strength of Six-Winged, even a piece of titanium alloy should have snapped, much less a rock.</p>
<p>Indeed, there’s something here! Zhou Wen made Six-Winged stop. He probably couldn’t move the Moon Rabbit stone with brute force.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen studied how to deal with the Moon Rabbit stone, but he failed to budge it despite exhausting all the methods he could think of. All he could do was leave White Cloud Mountain and return to the encampment. He planned on contacting The Thearch and asking her how to take the item under the Moon Rabbit Stone.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen returned to the encampment, Old He warmly welcomed him back. He also told him that An Sheng and An Tianzuo had already left because they were needed in Luoyang. They had left a message, saying that if Zhou Wen wanted to return, he could get Old He to drive him back.</p>
<p>On the rugged mountain road, An Sheng was fiddling with his phone while driving.</p>
<p>To him, multitasking was not a difficult task. There was no conflict between driving and playing games. Ordinary people were forbidden from doing this as it was very easy for accidents to happen, bringing harm to themselves and others.</p>
<p>The scene that appeared on An Sheng’s phone screen was the game that Zhou Wen had invested in. He held the phone in one hand as his fingers moved rapidly. It was no different from how others played with two hands. He was even more agile.</p>
<p>The game character used all sorts of odd positioning and releasing of skills to beat the Demonized Soldiers and Generals.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you driving properly? What are you doing there?” An Tianzuo, who was sitting behind with his eyes closed, suddenly asked.</p>
<p>“I downloaded the game that Zhou Wen and company made. Now that I’m trying it, it’s really not bad. The feedback from attacking and the usage of skills are very good. The parameters are also very similar to reality, especially those Demonized Soldiers and Generals. Their behavior and skills are identical to reality. After playing this game, if one were to encounter Demonized Soldiers and Generals, one would know how to deal with them. This game is really not bad. From the looks of it, Young Master Wen isn’t just playing games,” An Sheng said as he played.</p>
<p>“He’s just trying to play to the gallery. Watching a video allows one to understand dimensional creatures better than gaming. It’s not like I see him doing any research. All he does is game. The so-called understanding of dimensional creatures is just an excuse to game,” said An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>An Sheng defended Zhou Wen. “It’s still a little different. From watching the video, one can only know what kind of abilities a dimensional creature has. Ordinary people can’t tell what skills they can use to deal with it just by watching a video. However, in-game, they can attempt to use various skills to attack dimensional creatures. They can then know which skills are effective against them. Furthermore, through in-game combat, it’s easier to remember the timing of the various skills used by dimensional creatures. This game is a high-level strategy guide. It would be even better if we could turn it into a holographic game”</p>
<p>“I realize that ever since you and Zhou Wen went out a few times, you are getting better at clever, but false, arguments,” An Tianzuo said with a cold expression.</p>
<p>“Overseer, you’re right. It’s my fault. Games only make people lose their aspirations. It’s useless,” An Sheng hurriedly said.</p>
<p>“You’ve even learned how to agree overtly despite your private opposition. Indeed, one takes on the color of one’s company. Hand over the phone,” An Tianzuo said coldly when he saw that An Sheng was still playing.</p>
<p>“I was wrong, alright?” An Sheng hurriedly put away his phone.</p>
<p>“I told you to hand me the phone,” An Tianzuo said with a deadpan expression as he stared at An Sheng through the rearview mirror.</p>
<p>An Sheng helplessly handed his phone to An Tianzuo, who was sitting behind him. An Tianzuo reached out and took it. He glared at An Sheng and said, “Drive properly. If you continue with such nonsense, you’ll be punished to guard Chess Mountain.”</p>
<p>An Sheng tersely responded and continued driving. He didn’t dare do anything else.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo closed his eyes to rest for a while, but he had a nagging feeling. After a while, An Tianzuo opened his eyes again and picked up the phone beside him. After unlocking it, his gaze landed on the app icon named Dimension.</p>
<p>The corners of An Tianzuo’s eyes twitched slightly. He reached out and pulled the curtains to give himself privacy from An Sheng. Then, he said to him, “I’ll rest for a while. Don’t disturb me.”</p>
<p>“Got it, Overseer,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo held his phone and turned off the sound. Then, he tapped on the icon. Soon, an ink-styled interface appeared on his phone.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen rested in the encampment. As there was a signal in the encampment, he sent a message to The Thearch, but after waiting for several hours, he still didn’t receive a reply.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen thought that The Thearch wasn’t replying to him on purpose, he finally received a message. He opened it and saw that it was from The Thearch.</p>
<p>“To learn the divine art, one must self-castrate.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen read the message clearly and countless question marks appeared in his mind. Then, he sent a row of question marks.</p>
<p>“It was sent wrongly. It was for someone else. If you want the treasure, you must wait for the moon to rise.” The Thearch replied very quickly this time.</p>
<p>So I have to wait until the moon rises before I can obtain the treasure under the Moon Rabbit stone. Zhou Wen was enlightened, but he suddenly felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>“The Thearch, you said that you sent the message wrongly. Then who were you planning on sending that sentence to?” Zhou Wen’s expression turned odd.</p>
<p>Since The Thearch could use her phone to go online, it was not surprising that she could add friends on the Internet. The strange thing was, why did she send such a message to the other party?</p>
<p>“It’s a guy who wants to learn divine arts. His name seems to be John Cape,” The Thearch replied.</p>
<p>“John… Cape…” Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t forget this fellow. After all, it was because of Liz and John that he and the Cape family had become enemies.</p>
<h3 id='chapter521'>Chapter 521 Immortal Palace Phenomenon</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to ask what The Thearch was doing, but The Thearch didn’t reply to him. Zhou Wen had to temporarily put the matter aside.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Zhou Wen arrived in front of the Jade Rabbit’s Lunar Prayer stone again. There, he waited for the moon to rise from the east.</p>
<p>However, there was a problem. The Thearch said that he had to push the Moon Rabbit stone the moment the moon rose. Although Truth Listener was very powerful and could hear very minute sounds, it was still unknown if he could tell that the moon had risen.</p>
<p>If Truth Listener were to advance further in the future and advance to the Mythical stage, it might be able to hear something even deeper such as the rotations of electrons or the flowing sound of photons. When that happened, it was possible to use one’s hearing to determine if the moon had risen.</p>
<p>However, he definitely couldn’t do it now. After some hesitation, Zhou Wen switched his Essence Energy Art to a Dao Art before removing the balaclava.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen estimated the time. The moon was about to rise. If he were to use his eyes, he wouldn’t be so unlucky to chance upon the immortal palace phenomenon, right?</p>
<p>However, even if he were to see the immortal palace phenomenon, he had the Zero Taboo Life Soul. It was unlikely he would die so easily.</p>
<p>While waiting for the sun to set at the garrison, Zhou Wen studied his Zero Taboo Life Soul. After entering White Cloud Mountain’s Jade Emperor Peak and other dimensional zones, he discovered something.</p>
<p>Zero Taboo and Truth Listener’s Evil Nullification were somewhat different. When Evil Nullification was in effect, it could deal with man-made curses. Zero Taboo did little against them. According to Zhou Wen’s judgment, it worked against powers that came from the laws of nature.</p>
<p>For example, White Cloud Mountain’s Jade Emperor Peak, Small Buddha Temple, or Sei Gasakai’s Will Renewal. They were all unreasonable powers. That was just how the laws of nature worked.</p>
<p>Zero Taboo was very useful in this aspect. However, its effects were difficult to distinguish from Evil Nullification. There was some overlap between the two, and Zhou Wen was still studying them. His understanding of Zero Taboo wasn’t thorough enough, so he was still in the guessing phase.</p>
<p>However, Zero Taboo was not truly without any restrictions. It could last for about ten seconds inside White Cloud Mountain’s Jade Emperor Peak. Any longer, the Zero Taboo Life Soul would explode from the pressure.</p>
<p>In Small Buddha Temple, as long as he did not enter the temple hall, Zero Taboo was fine. However, once he entered the temple hall, it could only last for ten seconds.</p>
<p>Although the immortal palace phenomenon was terrifying, Zhou Wen guessed that it wouldn’t have much of an effect on him. Zero Taboo and Evil Nullification were of some use.</p>
<p>After pulling up the balaclava, Zhou Wen looked east. Although the sun and moon weren’t in the sky, it wasn’t too dark since the sun had just set.</p>
<p>As he looked over, he saw a sea of white clouds. Occasionally, a few mountain peaks would appear out of the sea of clouds, like a few black islands in a white sea. The scene was indeed as beautiful as a fairyland.</p>
<p>It’s a pity that no one has the chance to enjoy such beautiful scenery. If it was before the dimensional storms, I’m afraid this place would have been filled with tourists. Zhou Wen suddenly felt that the dimensional storms might not be a bad thing. If there were tourists crowding the place, no matter how beautiful it was, it would be greatly affected.</p>
<p>The immortal palace didn’t appear. Zhou Wen kept track of time and knew that the moon would rise at any moment. He didn’t wear the balaclava and sat there to watch the sea of clouds.</p>
<p>On the mountains above the sea of clouds, he could see some ancient buildings. However, they weren’t places he could go carelessly. Zhou Wen only admired them for the time being.</p>
<p>After waiting for less than two minutes, a crescent moon slowly floated out from the sea of clouds’ horizon. The moonlight was not strong and it was not bright. It was very mild.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to push the Moon Rabbit stone again, a white jade-like immortal palace appeared where the crescent moon rose.</p>
<p>There were pavilions and pagodas, as well as jade halls and shrines. Beautiful and elegant immortal palaces appeared in the clouds, and he could even see fairies flitting about. Faintly, he could even hear singing coming from those immortal palaces.</p>
<p>Immortal palace phenomenon! Zhou Wen was alarmed. The Zero Taboo Life Soul had already lit up his mind. Clearly, it had a reaction to the immortal palace phenomenon.</p>
<p>The intensity of the Zero Taboo’s reaction wasn’t inferior to the Jade Emperor Peak. Zhou Wen took a careful look before closing his eyes and pulling down the balaclava.</p>
<p>The brightened Zero Taboo Life Soul also dimmed.</p>
<p>Thankfully, my theory is correct. Zero Taboo seems to be useful against all taboo powers in a dimensional zone. Zhou Wen recalled the scene of the immortal palace in his mind.</p>
<p>The immortal palace was extremely magnificent, but it didn’t have much value to Zhou Wen. Instead, it was the dancing fairies that gave him some insight.</p>
<p>The Fairy in Dragon Gate Grotto was only at the Epic stage after all. Transcendent Flying Immortal’s attack was only an Epic Essence Energy Skill. Although through Zhou Wen’s constant insight and creativity, it had reached an outstanding level at the Epic stage, it was still inferior to a true godlike skill.</p>
<p>Having seen the figures of the fairies in the immortal palace, Zhou Wen immediately gained new insights.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, if those fairies really existed, they would all be true Mythical creatures.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fairies’ stances, Zhou Wen extended his hand to push the Moon Rabbit stone just as the moon rose. Although it was still very heavy, it moved slightly with his strength.</p>
<p>Overjoyed, Zhou Wen pushed harder and shoved the Moon Rabbit stone to the side bit by bit. Then, he realized that beneath it was a jade box embedded in the stone’s indentation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out to take out the jade box, only to find it cold to the touch.</p>
<p>After touching the indentation and confirming that there was nothing else, Zhou Wen pushed the Moon Rabbit stone back.</p>
<p>With the jade box in his arms, Zhou Wen planned on looking at what was inside the box when he returned home. Since he had already obtained it, he wasn’t in a hurry.</p>
<p>As he thought about leaving the mountain, he couldn’t bear it. After some thought, Zhou Wen pulled up the balaclava slightly and looked at the rising moon in the east.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of the immortal palace was still there. Numerous immortal palaces floated above the sea of clouds, looking extremely realistic. It was not something ethereal like a mirage.</p>
<p>The fairies danced among the immortal palaces. All of them had elegant and graceful postures. They seemed much more profound than the Fairies in Dragon Gate Grotto.</p>
<p>Zero Taboo kept emitting light. It felt like it would shatter in a few more seconds.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare take another look. Just as he was about to close his eyes, he suddenly saw a beautiful fairy fly out from a palace. The moment she appeared, the other fairies immediately paled in comparison. It was as though the halo around them had vanished as they became mere mortal beauties.</p>
<p>Only the fairy who had just appeared deserved being described as an “immortal fairy.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only took a glance and saw numerous crisscrossing cracks appear on the Zero Taboo crystal. Just as it was about to explode, Zhou Wen hurriedly closed his eyes in fright.</p>
<h3 id='chapter522'>Chapter 522 Change in Ranking</h3>
<p>This time, when he closed his eyes, the Zero Taboo crystal didn’t immediately extinguish. It continued emitting light. The cracks on the crystal were still spreading, and it was about to shatter. It left Zhou Wen shuddering in fear.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the crystal didn’t shatter and the light gradually dimmed.</p>
<p>Now, the Zero Taboo crystal was like a glass bead that had been doused in cold water after being heated over a flame. It was full of cracks, looking as if it would shatter at any moment.</p>
<p>Amazing. I only took a glance at her and she nearly blasted apart my Life Soul. If she really exists, I wonder what status she has among Mythical creatures? Zhou Wen could still recall the scene of the fairy dancing in the air. Her figure seemed to contain some profound charms. It was indescribably beautiful and shocking.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen closed his eyes and sat on the Moon Rabbit stone. He carefully recalled the details of the fairy’s figure, hoping to figure out the true secret of Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could sense that the fairy’s figure was extremely valuable to his Transcendent Flying Immortal, but after thinking for a long time, he felt that there was something in the way between the two. It made him feel like he was looking at a beauty through a layer of frosted glass. He could see her, but not clearly. He couldn’t help but feel vexed.</p>
<p>He stood up and walked down the mountain. He wanted to have a change of environment and mood; perhaps that way, he might be able to understand what was happening. He would never dare to look at that immortal palace phenomenon again.</p>
<p>After returning to the encampment, Zhou Wen took out the jade box and placed it on the table. After studying it for a while, he opened the lid.</p>
<p>Inside the jade box were dozens of crystals the size of cat eyes. They were of different colors and shapes.</p>
<p>I wonder what attributes these dimensional crystals have? Zhou Wen took out his mysterious phone and snapped them.</p>
<p>It turned out that they were all Epic dimensional crystals. Most of them were crystals of the four basic stats. Only two were Essence Energy Skill Crystals. This left Zhou Wen somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>He originally believed that The Thearch’s mention of something would be no trifling matter. Although Epic crystals were not bad, they were far inferior to the Mythical crystal from before.</p>
<p>However, on second thought, it made sense. The Thearch told him about these so that he could exchange them for money, so why would she get him to retrieve Mythical crystals that weren’t easily sold?</p>
<p>Epic crystals were the easiest to produce at present. Furthermore, there was a relatively high demand for them. There were at least ten crystals and they all had different attributes. Some were bad, while others were not bad. The best one was a Speed Crystal with 38 stats. It was likely worth quite a bit of money.</p>
<p>Of course, the most valuable ones were the two Essence Energy Skill Crystals. One was the Cloud Crane Crystal, while the other was the Cloud Deer Crystal. Zhou Wen had never seen these two dimensional creatures before, nor did he know what skills they had.</p>
<p>He placed the crystals back into the jade box and picked it up to put into the chaos space.</p>
<p>The dimensional crystals weren’t very warm, but the jade box was as cold as ice. It didn’t seem ordinary.</p>
<p>Is it possible that this jade box is something good? Zhou Wen held the jade box and began studying it.</p>
<p>The jade box was the color of the moon. It was translucent and he almost could see through it, but it also appeared opaque. It was as if there were clouds within the jade.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen carefully studied the jade box, he found something amiss.</p>
<p>There were many cloud patterns engraved on the jade box. The patterns were of different shapes and sizes. If one were to look at them with the eyes of an ordinary person, they would be clouds of different shapes and sizes. One would write it off as nothing special.</p>
<p>Even though some people felt that the cloud patterns were special, it was difficult to see the true meaning behind them.</p>
<p>However, after Zhou Wen carefully observed them, he realized that the different types of clouds contained the beauty of a fairy’s figure. Every cloud pattern looked like a fairy. If he hadn’t seen the fairies flying, it would probably be difficult for him to tell the charms of these cloud patterns.</p>
<p>This is really something good. Zhou Wen picked up the jade box and continued studying the cloud patterns. As he looked at them, he compared them with the fairy poses he had seen. His understanding deepened.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was studying the cloud patterns, another shocking event happened. The black cube lit up again before another Companion Beast appeared on the ranking.</p>
<p>The second Companion Beast on the ranking was actually the publicly acknowledged number one Companion Beast, Verbis Diablo Holy Angel.</p>
<p>The Verbis Diablo Holy Angel’s ranking had been ranked by a big organization in the Federation. It was known as the number one pet at the Epic stage. Now that it had taken its place on the cube’s ranking, it actually failed to surpass the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. It was only ranked second.</p>
<p>No one could help but speculate how powerful the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon was to be able to suppress the Verbis Diablo Holy Angel. This was truly quite a shock.</p>
<p>In the past few days, there had been no movement. Only Six-Winged had been placed on the list. When the Verbis Diablo Holy Angel entered the rankings, many Companion Beasts sprouted like mushrooms after a rain. They were listed one after another.</p>
<p>On the cube’s screen, various pet creatures constantly appeared. Apart from the angel and dragon, there were also sprites, magical beasts, and other Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, which was originally in first place, dropped to third place in a day. Eight others ranked after it. A total of eleven Companion Beasts were listed.</p>
<p>Two Companion Beasts ranked ahead of the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. The first was Death of the Underworld, while the second was Frost Giant. They were Companion Beasts no one had heard of before.</p>
<p>As for the famous Verbis Diablo Holy Angel, it was ranked dead last among all the Companion Beasts on the list.</p>
<p>This caused a huge wave of discussion across the entire Federation. Only then did many ordinary people realize that the so-called strongest Verbis Diablo Holy Angel was just a bottom-tier existence in the world of truly powerful pets.</p>
<p>The powerful Companion Beasts were enough to make one gasp in excitement. However, at the same time, people were guessing who the extremely powerful Companion Beasts belonged to.</p>
<p>Including Zhou Wen’s Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, there were a total of three dragons that entered the rankings. It could be said that among all the Mythical creatures, they were the most common species.</p>
<p>However, one tidbit was very surprising. All the Companion Beasts that entered the rankings—be they angels, dragons, elemental sprites, or Death—were Companion Beasts from the West and North Districts. They didn’t see any special Companion Beasts from East District and South District on the list.</p>
<p>In fact, all the families that made a move this time came from the West and North Districts. Among them, the Cape family of the West District put in the most work and managed to occupy four ranks in one go.</p>
<p>The East District’s Xia family and Zhang family, and the South District’s Dugu family didn’t have any Companion Beasts appear on the ranking. The four districts seemed to have a completely different attitude towards the rankings.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know anything about the change in ranking. Although Zhou Wen declined Old He’s offer to take him back, Old He insisted.</p>
<h3 id='chapter523'>Chapter 523 Flying Immortal Stance</h3>
<p>After returning to school, Zhou Wen heard the students discussing the Companion Beasts on the rankings. Ordinary students suspected that they were Mythical Companion Beasts, but no one had ever seen one.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also went online to take a look. Many media outlets and individuals had captured the pictures of the Companion Beasts on the cube.</p>
<p>Death of the Underworld looked very strange. He was wearing a gray cloak. Black and blue light filled its insides. He did not have a physical body and looked a little like the legendary Death. However, he did not have a scythe in his hands.</p>
<p>Frost Giant was a giant with a deep blue body. Wherever he went, ice would form on the ground.</p>
<p>The other Companion Beasts were also unique. Angels were holy, sprites were beautiful, and dragons looked about the same. However, for a Companion Beast to be ranked, one could tell that they were extraordinary just from their aura alone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, only the images of the Companion Beasts were shown on the cube. Their skills weren’t listed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what the ranking was for, but he quickly lost interest. He picked up his phone and continued grinding Torch Dragon. After his battle with Torch Dragon, Zhou Wen gradually started to use his speed and crystal mirror to block Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a Sun Beast Companion Egg was a rare drop. If there were two or more crystal mirrors, the success rate of killing Torch Dragon would be much higher.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought of many solutions. For example, using a large number of Companion Beasts to shield him, but it was useless. The blood-colored avatar and all the Companion Beasts in front of him were reflected into the vision world.</p>
<p>Apart from the crystal mirror that could reflect, the other Companion Beasts weren’t of much use.</p>
<p>As for using the crystal mirror to block Torch Dragon’s gaze, he needed to grasp the timing and position perfectly, or it would be very difficult to block.</p>
<p>The problem was that Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World wasn’t a skill that could only be used once. Therefore, Zhou Wen needed to defend against it many times in battle. Otherwise, he would die.</p>
<p>As for Demonic Neonate that remained on the blood-colored avatar’s back, she constantly tried to find Torch Dragon’s flaws to attack it. There were a few times when she really found an opportunity. The ancient sword stabbed at Torch Dragon, but it only managed to penetrate a tiny length of the blade. It did not pose much of a threat to Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>As for the blood-colored avatar, it couldn’t survive until Demonic Neonate killed Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>According to Zhou Wen’s calculations, he needed to survive at least three hours in front of Torch Dragon before Demonic Neonate could kill it.</p>
<p>This was the best situation. If the situation didn’t go as smoothly as Zhou Wen expected, it might take even longer.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s most pressing problem was to 100% block the Bright Torch Vision World for those few hours. Just one mistake meant immediate death. All his efforts would be in vain.</p>
<p>After a bitter battle for an hour, the blood-colored avatar was once again killed by Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World. This was the longest time Zhou Wen had lasted.</p>
<p>I can’t make any mistakes, and I have to be absolutely precise. In a high-intensity battle, I have to ensure that I can throw out the crystal mirror with perfect timing and positioning while facing a powerful creature like Torch Dragon. Furthermore, it’s really difficult to judge Torch Dragon’s actions accurately.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought about it and realized that it was very difficult for him to boost his success rate. After all, the other party was a Mythical creature stronger than him. It wasn’t that easy to determine its actions and motions.</p>
<p>Since it’s very difficult to improve my judgment, I can only increase my speed and ability to adjust my position. I’ll try my best to prevent Torch Dragon from seeing me.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the following battles, Zhou Wen consciously fused Dragon Gate Flying Immortal Skill and Transcendent Flying Immortal into the fairy stance he had comprehended, hoping to improve his movement technique to another level.</p>
<p>This wasn’t an easy task. Zhou Wen felt that there was a barrier between the fairy’s stances and his movement techniques. It was very difficult to achieve perfection, and there would be problems when fusing them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t someone who would give up in the face of adversity. He continued researching and improving, especially the beautiful fairy’s stance. Zhou Wen spent a great deal of time comprehending and researching.</p>
<p>At the bureau’s headquarters, there was a lot of information placed in front of Shen Yuchi. It was all about the black cubes and the Companion Beasts on the ranking.</p>
<p>“Director-General, other than the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, the origins of the other Companion Beasts are almost confirmed,” Qiao Siyuan said.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi nodded slightly. “Why did those families in the West and North District put their Mythical pets on the rankings? Have you investigated?”</p>
<p>In fact, Shen Yuchi didn’t need to investigate to know which families these Companion Beasts came from. The key was why they wanted to expose their Mythical Companion Beasts to the public.</p>
<p>Before this, every family clan hid their Mythical Companion Beasts, afraid that others would know how many they had. But this time, they actually revealed a portion of them.</p>
<p>Although a number were already known to outsiders, it still felt puzzling.</p>
<p>“According to our investigations, those few families seem to have figured out some of the secrets of the black cube. They know that there would be benefits if they were to be ranked, which is why they made such a move. However, this information has not been verified yet, so we don’t know of its veracity,” Qiao Siyuan answered very conservatively.</p>
<p>“What kind of benefits?” Shen Yuchi knew what Qiao Siyuan was getting at. This news should have come from within those few families, but he couldn’t guarantee that they were using it as a smokescreen.</p>
<p>“From what they say, the Companion Beasts on the ranking might be fancied by terrifying existences in the dimensional zones. There might be benefits, but they aren’t sure if the news is real or not, nor do they know what benefits there will be.” Qiao Siyuan explained the information he gathered in detail.</p>
<p>After Shen Yuchi heard that, he remained silent.</p>
<p>“Director-General, what should we do?” Qiao Siyuan asked.</p>
<p>“The Zhang family, the Xia family, and the Dugu family didn’t make a move. The West and North Districts only sent some Companion Beasts as a test. It’s not time for us to step forward. Let’s just wait and see for now.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Shen Yuchi asked again, “How’s the progress of Wang Mingyuan’s students?”</p>
<p>“It’s not going well. Zhou Wen and Hui Haifeng are protected by their families, so it’s very difficult to bring them back. Jiang Yan and Zhong Ziya’s whereabouts are unknown. We’ve been tracking them for so long, but we haven’t been able to catch them. None of Wang Mingyuan’s four students are simple. I think Wang Mingyuan might have other motives for taking them in as his students. It’s not just a coincidence.”</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan paused and said, “Besides, the six families aren’t too concerned about this matter now. For some reason, even the Cape family that wanted to capture Zhou Wen the most seem to have forgotten about it. They’re all focused on the rankings.”</p>
<p>“That’s strange.” Shen Yuchi pondered over the cause and effect of everything.</p>
<h3 id='chapter524'>Chapter 524 In the Name of an Angel</h3>
<p>In a mysterious land of the West District, in front of an ancient, glorious cathedral, John advanced step by step. Every step he took felt as if he was going against the flow. It drained all his strength.</p>
<p>Within the cathedral, a holy light shone out, causing people to involuntarily lower their heads, not daring to look at the light.</p>
<p>When John walked to the door of the cathedral and pushed open the door with all his strength, the holy light instantly illuminated the entire world. John saw a huge angel mural inside the cathedral.</p>
<p>The portrait of the angel drew a holy six-winged seraphim. Strangely, there was a drop of blood at the corner of the six-winged seraphim’s eye. Its eyes seemed to contain endless sorrow.</p>
<p>John’s gaze was only slightly shocked by the six-winged seraphim’s portrait before he was attracted by something in it.</p>
<p>Between the six-winged seraphim’s hands was a strange white cocoon-like object. It was clearly a portrait, but the white cocoon in the picture seemed to exist.</p>
<p>“The Thearch didn’t lie to me… There’s really such a thing… It really exists…” John looked excited as he stared at the white cocoon in the painting. His eyes gradually turned strange.</p>
<p>Gritting his teeth, John walked to the portrait of the six-winged seraphim and cut his palm with a knife, letting his blood drip onto the white cocoon.</p>
<p>It was clearly a mural, but when John’s blood dripped onto the white cocoon, it strangely slid to the side. Not a single drop of blood touched the white cocoon.</p>
<p>Do I really have to do that to hatch it? John’s eyes gradually wore a crazed look as he watched his blood drop to the ground.</p>
<p>No matter what price I have to pay… I must defeat that person… I must… Just as the madness in John’s eyes reached its apex, he suddenly held the knife and slashed at his lower body.</p>
<p>Blood splattered as something fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The blood which flowed from John’s palm was unable to touch the white cocoon in the beginning. It was as though there was a force that kept the blood away from it. But now, the white cocoon no longer rejected John’s blood. Drops of blood landed on it and seeped in. Soon, it dyed the white cocoon red.</p>
<p>As the white cocoon absorbed the blood, it emitted a holy light. John’s body bathed in the holy light as his wounds healed rapidly.</p>
<p>At the same time, his damaged Essence Energy sea was restored. Furthermore, his entire body had undergone a strange transformation.</p>
<p>John felt a pure and holy power flowing through his body. It was stronger and purer than before he was injured.</p>
<p>Under the support of that power, his Holy Emperor Body also underwent an unpredictable change.</p>
<p>John felt his body hurt and itch all over as though he was undergoing puberty again. He felt the strength in his body constantly increasing. John almost couldn’t feel the pain and only felt extremely excited.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>The strength within John’s body burst out uncontrollably. His limbs flailed in the air in an exaggerated manner. His skin was milk-like and he emitted a holy radiance. And behind him, a pair of snow-white angel wings appeared.</p>
<p>However, this pair of angel wings was only an illusion and not a real existence.</p>
<p>John was already handsome to begin with, but now he looked even more handsome. He was like an angel from heaven, as though he was from another world.</p>
<p>Compared to John from the past, this John was less masculine and more feminine.</p>
<p>This wasn’t strange, because angels had no gender.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>When John’s body completed the transformation from a human to an angel, the white cocoon cracked and gradually revealed a figure in the cocoon.</p>
<p>It was an angel who was even more handsome than John. He had six angel wings on his back, and his blonde hair emitted a sun-like radiance. His entire body seemed to be enveloped by holy light.</p>
<p>When he walked out of the white cocoon, the entire world seemed to be subdued by his radiance and turned dim.</p>
<p>John looked at the six-winged seraphim in front of him with a fervent gaze. He felt that the power in his body was getting stronger and stronger, as if it was affected by the six-winged seraphim.</p>
<p>He looked down at John like a god. He extended a hand and pressed it on John’s head. He said calmly, “In the name of an angel, I’ll bestow you the power to be protected…”</p>
<p>With that holy voice, a terrifying holy light erupted from the palm of the six-winged seraphim, enveloping John’s body completely in holy light. Finally, even the six-winged seraphim’s body was devoured by the holy light.</p>
<p>After the holy light dissipated, only John was left in front of the portrait of the cathedral. However, he had an additional snow-white angel armor and six snow-white angel wings on his back. His entire body emitted terrifying holy light.</p>
<p>Did it succeed? How interesting. I wonder if this is the first guardian to appear. Far away in Chess Mountain’s cave, a seductive woman who was chained up suddenly had a strange look in her eyes as though she had sensed something.</p>
<p>However, the strange expression disappeared very quickly. She looked at the cell phone floating in front of her. There were photos on the cell phone interface. The content was actually a picture of Wang Mingyuan breaking into the alternate dimension.</p>
<p>I didn’t expect that there would be such a powerful person among the humans today. He actually devoured the guardian of the dragons? It seems that the human world isn’t as boring as I thought. The seductive woman retracted her gaze and suddenly revealed a strange smile. She opened the chat app and clicked on a friend profile picture to send a message.</p>
<p>In the seductive woman’s friend list, there were only two groups. One group had more friends, while the other group only had one person. Now, she had sent the message to the friend in that one group.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was studying the Flying Immortal pose when he suddenly heard his phone ring. He knew that it was a message from The Thearch. He opened it and couldn’t help but frown slightly.</p>
<p>“You have big trouble awaiting you.” There were only six simple words on the message.</p>
<p>“The Thearch, I haven’t offended you recently, right?” Zhou Wen replied.</p>
<p>“Since when did I say you offended me?” The Thearch replied.</p>
<p>“Then why are you giving me trouble?”</p>
<p>“Other than me, can’t anyone else give you trouble?”</p>
<p>“Apart from you, should there be anyone else? ” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“That might not be the case.” The Thearch then sent another message. “I’ll give you a chance. Be good and come to Chess Mountain to swear loyalty to me. I can help you tide through this calamity.”</p>
<p>“I appreciate your kindness,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll wait for you to come to Chess Mountain to beg me.” The Thearch seemed very confident.</p>
<h3 id='chapter525'>Chapter 525 Official Challenge</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that if The Thearch said that there was trouble, there was a high chance that it was real trouble. However, if he always remained subservient to her, there was no room for negotiation in the future.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wish to be a puppet that was at the mercy of others. Furthermore, he also wanted to know if his Zero Taboo could withstand The Thearch’s wish powers.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen became extra careful, he constantly studied the Flying Immortal stance. The Rank 10 Dragon Gate Flying Immortal Skill and Transcendent Flying Immortal had some improvement, but they had yet to take the final step needed for a breakthrough.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what breaking through an Epic Rank 10 Essence Energy Skill would become. It would be best if he could break through to the Mythical stage, but it clearly wasn’t that easy.</p>
<p>Through his battle with Torch Dragon, Zhou Wen constantly honed himself. It could be said that his posture was very similar to that of a flying immortal, but he was still lacking something. He had yet to reach that realm.</p>
<p>Sometimes, many inventions that shocked the world needed a flash of insight other than continuous experiments. What Zhou Wen lacked now was that glimmer of light in the darkness.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could now last for more than two hours in the battle with Torch Dragon, but it was useless. Even if he lasted 99% of the time, everything was useless if he didn’t kill Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was gaming one day when he suddenly received a call from An Sheng.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, there’s something I have to tell you. This matter can only be decided by you.” An Sheng’s voice was a little solemn. It was different from the usual An Sheng.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen knew that something that could make An Sheng so serious was definitely not simple. He recalled the trouble The Thearch had mentioned.</p>
<p>“John of the Cape family, do you still remember this person?” An Sheng asked after some thought.</p>
<p>“I remember. He once came to our school,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s because he lost to you and had his Essence Energy sea crippled that he made a request to our An family to have a fair battle with you. Furthermore, he took the initiative to propose a duel in Luoyang,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat. He knew that the trouble The Thearch mentioned was most likely John. He remembered that The Thearch had previously chatted with John online.</p>
<p>“Because the other party has officially proposed a duel and is willing to come to Luoyang alone to challenge you, it’s not appropriate for us to reject him on your behalf. You have to decide on this matter yourself. If you aren’t willing, Young Master Wen, you can reject it,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“John’s Essence Energy sea should have been destroyed, right? How did he recover so quickly?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“In theory, it shouldn’t have been possible for him to recover so quickly. However, since he dares to challenge you in Luoyang, I’m afraid he has not only recovered, but he should also have improved.” An Sheng paused for a moment before saying, “From my point of view, I don’t think you need to take the risk to accept the challenge, Young Master Wen.”</p>
<p>“You think I’ll lose?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. An Sheng should know that he had a Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. It was clearly unusual for him to persuade him not to accept the challenge under such circumstances.</p>
<p>“The Cape family has Mythical creatures as well. On the cube’s ranking, there are four Mythical pets from the Cape family. I suspect that John will be bringing a Mythical Companion Beast with him this time.” An Sheng shared his thoughts.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as An Sheng continued, “Mythical Companion Beasts have their own specialties. It’s very dangerous to rashly accept challenges without knowing what abilities they have. I’ve seen some Mythical creatures before. Their abilities are extremely unreasonable. As long as you get hit, death is certain. There’s nothing you can do about that even if you’re stronger than him. Just like Love Letter, we studied it for years and only attacked it after knowing its various abilities. Otherwise, we would definitely suffer heavy losses.”</p>
<p>“I understand what you mean, but I want to accept this challenge,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>From Zhou Wen’s point of view, this wasn’t a battle between him and John, but a secret battle between him and The Thearch.</p>
<p>The Thearch seemed to play both sides, seemingly purposefully but also inadvertently making Zhou Wen rely on her more and more.</p>
<p>Just like the previous few times when she showed her might to him or gave him benefits, she would intentionally or unintentionally show Zhou Wen her strength and invincibility. She would inadvertently create a lofty image, as though Zhou Wen would enjoy endless benefits as long as he remained subservient to her. And if he disobeyed her, he would suffer an irresistible blow.</p>
<p>Although The Thearch hadn’t really harmed Zhou Wen from beginning to end, Zhou Wen could sense that this wasn’t a good thing.</p>
<p>In the past, the former principal had once said to Zhou Wen that one needed to respect everyone, but one couldn’t let respect turn into reliance. Otherwise, one would lose the possibility of reaching the pinnacle because the person you relied on was your end.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen wanted to accept this challenge not because he wanted to defeat John, but because he wanted to break the net that The Thearch had weaved over him. He wanted The Thearch to fail once.</p>
<p>“Alright, since you’ve already decided, I know what to do. I’ll help you choose the location and time. In Luoyang, you won’t be at a disadvantage. No one can use external forces to affect you, but you have to be careful. Don’t underestimate John just because he has lost to you before,” An Sheng said seriously.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Zhou Wen felt a sense of warmth in his heart. An Sheng was truly concerned about him. It had been a long time since someone cared for him.</p>
<p>An Sheng hung up the phone and turned to say to An Tianzuo, who was sitting behind his desk, “Overseer, Young Master Wen has decided to accept the challenge.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, he’s still too young. Since John dares to come to Luoyang alone, he must have made all the necessary preparations. The battle is extremely dangerous, so there’s no need for him to take the risk,” said An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>An Sheng smiled and asked, “Overseer, if it’s you, would you accept or refuse?”</p>
<p>“If I accepted it, that’d be because I have the strength to deal with any situation.” Although An Tianzuo didn’t give a direct answer, anyone could tell that he would accept it if it were him.</p>
<p>“I believe Young Master Wen can handle it as well,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“I’m just afraid that he will be arrogant and think that he’s invincible after obtaining a Mythical Companion Beast. When that happens, he won’t even know how he died,” sneered An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>It wasn’t An Sheng’s place to say anything else. An Tianzuo paused before saying, “Go and set up the venue. If the empress dowager finds out that he suffered, she’ll probably launch a tirade at me again.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” An Sheng accepted the order and left.</p>
<p>Few people knew that John was going to Luoyang to challenge Zhou Wen, but it spread among the six families. The other families found it odd.</p>
<p>It hadn’t been long since John’s Essence Energy sea was crippled, but he had recovered so quickly. He even dared to challenge Zhou Wen in Luoyang. Clearly, this was something unusual. Many families were secretly observing the matter.</p>
<h3 id='chapter526'>Chapter 526 Figuring Out Flying Immortal</h3>
<p>Strangely, the Cape family seemed to have a rather strange reaction towards John challenging Zhou Wen.After some inquiries from the other families, even they didn’t know why John had challenged Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“This matter is indeed a little strange. Xuan Yue, spectate the battle.” Xia Dongyue said to Xia Xuanyue.</p>
<p>“Is it necessary?” Xia Xuanyue asked in doubt.</p>
<p>“Just take it as a vacation.” Xia Dongyue smiled.</p>
<p>The reactions of the families were somewhat different. After investigations, they discovered that John wasn’t challenging Zhou Wen because of the Cape family’s ploy. It was just John acting as an individual. This reduced the attention on the matter.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue packed her stuff and headed to Luoyang.</p>
<p>Ever since she lost her Mythical Companion Beast, Xia Xuanyue hadn’t been doing well. The Xia family had a higher chance of obtaining a Mythical Companion Beast than the average person thanks to the possession of a Mythical Companion Beast.</p>
<p>However, it still wasn’t easy to obtain another Mythical Companion Beast. Even the Xia family needed a lot of investigation time before killing a Mythical creature. They needed to be fully prepared before sending their experts out with their Mythical pets. This typically took months.</p>
<p>And it was uncertain if a Mythical Companion Egg would drop. Even if they obtained a Mythical Companion Egg, with so many people in the Xia family in line for one, it was hard to say when it would be Xia Xuanyue’s turn again.</p>
<p>The incubation of Mythical Companion Beasts was also a huge problem. Wild Mythical Companion Eggs required too much Essence Energy to incubate. Typical Epic humans wouldn’t be able to withstand it. They needed to use some special methods, and the cost was similarly large.</p>
<p>After arriving in Luoyang, before the date of the duel, Xia Xuanyue went to a few famous dimensional zones in Luoyang to take a look. One of them was the famous Dragon Gate Grotto.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue proceeded to explore the caves that she could enter. When she arrived at the Lotus Flower Cave, she saw a familiar person battling with the Fairies inside.</p>
<p>It’s him! Xia Xuanyue instantly recognized that the person battling the Fairies was Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>She had a deep impression of Zhou Wen. After all, she had previously stopped Zhou Wen from killing the girl. Her Mythical Companion Beast had mysteriously disappeared after that.</p>
<p>Furthermore, she had come to Luoyang to watch Zhou Wen and John’s duel.</p>
<p>After watching from the side for a while, Xia Xuanyue realized that rather than a battle, Zhou Wen was imitating the Fairy’s actions.</p>
<p>It was obvious that Zhou Wen was much stronger than the Fairy. It wouldn’t be difficult for him to kill her, but he didn’t do so. All he did was use a movement technique similar to the Fairy as he constantly circled around her.</p>
<p>Is he learning the Fairy’s movement technique? Xia Xuanyue watched from the side for a while, and the more she watched, the more confused she became.</p>
<p>Others became better from imitating and practicing. However, Zhou Wen seemed to become worse. His originally elegant movement technique had turned stiffer and stiffer.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue had seen too many geniuses who improved from learning, but this was the first time she was seeing someone like Zhou Wen who became worse.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Flying Immortal Stance had always lacked meaning. Since he couldn’t see the scenery of the immortal palace in-game, Zhou Wen decided to come to Lotus Flower Cave to fight the Fairy and directly compare the difference between the Fairy and the Flying Immortal. He wanted to see if he could figure out the reason he couldn’t keep up with it.</p>
<p>Through actual combat, he could see some differences.</p>
<p>The Fairy’s movement techniques were the same as the Flying Immortals Zhou Wen saw. They were both elegant and peerless, like fairies dancing in the clouds. Their stances were also very similar.</p>
<p>The only difference was the intent.</p>
<p>They were both fairies that flew, and Fairies originated from Buddhism. As for Flying Immortals, they were from Daoism. There was a huge gap between their auras, and it could even be said that they were completely different.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen understood this, he immediately felt enlightened. He knew why he felt that something was amiss. It was normal for him to have a barrier when learning the Daoist’s Flying Immortal stance with a Buddhist foundation.</p>
<p>During his battle with the Fairy, Zhou Wen constantly considered how he could resolve this problem. The more he practiced, the more he realized that the concept of Fairy was completely different from that of a Flying Immortal, maybe even the opposite. If he wanted to master the Flying Immortal Stance, he had to completely change the concept of his movement technique before he could truly master the Flying Immortal stance of Daoism.</p>
<p>Therefore, while fighting the Fairy, Zhou Wen constantly weakened the similarities between his movement techniques from the Fairy’s, slowly wiping away the concept of the Fairy.</p>
<p>He planned to first master the Flying Immortal Stance before trying to see if he could fuse the two together.</p>
<p>This resulted in the situation that Xia Xuanyue saw. Zhou Wen’s movement technique seemed to be getting worse as he practiced. It left Xia Xuanyue puzzled as to what Zhou Wen was doing.</p>
<p>After watching for a while, Zhou Wen’s movement technique had become terrible. From Xia Xuanyue’s point of view, the movement technique looked showy, but it lacked charm.</p>
<p>However, Xia Xuanyue soon realized that Zhou Wen’s movement technique had changed again. His originally stiff movement technique seemed to become elegant again. However, this grace was different from that of a Fairy.</p>
<p>Strange? It seems to be a Fairy’s movement technique, but why does it feel like the two movement techniques are completely different? Xia Xuanyue could sense a problem.</p>
<p>It was also an extremely elegant movement technique. The movement techniques of a Fairy had a dancing aura, but Zhou Wen’s movement technique looked even more transcendent. It didn’t have the feeling of decadence.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also pleasantly surprised. After completely erasing the concept of the Fairy movement technique, he realized that the barrier he had previously felt seemed to have vanished. His movement technique became more and more fluid.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue could not help but feel a little surprised. Despite Zhou Wen clearly imitating the Fairy’s movement technique, he was able to cultivate something that was completely different. It was her first time seeing such a person.</p>
<p>This Zhou Wen is indeed different from the rest. It’s no wonder even a peer like Lance was defeated by him. Xia Xuanyue nodded inwardly.</p>
<p>Ka-Cha!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t plan on killing the Fairy, all he did was pass by the Fairy and the force from his clothes sliced through her body, causing her to die.</p>
<p>Having lost his opponent, Zhou Wen felt somewhat at a loss. At that moment, he was filled with inspiration and was just about to take another step forward when he suddenly lost his opponent. The inability to unleash his powers made him unable to vent his frustration.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to head to the depths of the cave to look for another Fairy, even if it was a few Fairy Beasts, he suddenly felt a sharp sword intent piercing through the air.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed. He had been using the Truth Listener earring all this while, but he hadn’t discovered that a person was here. Although this had something to do with his focus while practicing the Flying Immortal Stance, it also meant that the person was not one to be trifled with.</p>
<p>The sword intent was like a tidal wave. A black-clothed woman used her finger as a sword as she cut through the air. Her figure was like a long beam of light as a cold wind blew.</p>
<h3 id='chapter527'>Chapter 527 Path to Snatching Heaven</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen was surprised to see that it was Xia Xuanyue.</p>
<p>The shocking scene of Xia Xuanyue having her ancient sword forcefully snatched by Demonic Neonate remained fresh in his mind.</p>
<p>Could it be that Xia Xuanyue knows that I snatched the ancient sword and specially came to settle scores with me? Zhou Wen originally wanted to explain, but Xia Xuanyue’s sword intent was just too powerful and her movement techniques were too fast. He didn’t even have the chance to explain.</p>
<p>Whether I’m right or wrong, I’ll beat her first. The one with the biggest fist has the final say. Zhou Wen understood the logic and didn’t wish to explain further. He used his newly learned Flying Immortal Stance to fight Xia Xuanyue.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue was many times more powerful than the Fairy. She immediately put immense pressure on Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen wasn’t satisfied to begin with. So the pressure made him feel an indescribable joy as he displayed the Flying Immortal Stance he had learned.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue’s movement technique was a secret art of the Xia family, named “Path to Snatching Heaven.” Originally there was no path in the world. Living beings in this world needed to snatch a path from heaven to survive. That was why it had such a strange name as the Path to Snatching Heaven.</p>
<p>“Fighting all living beings for the space for survival means that only one can survive.” This was the first sentence of the Path to Snatching Heaven. Hence, the Xia family’s Path to Snatching Heaven could be said to be a battle for every inch of land. I’ll walk the path you take, leaving you nowhere to go. Thus, the Path to Snatching Heaven’s “snatching” was fully displayed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was initially delighted, but not long after, the carefree feeling vanished without a trace. He felt even more stifled than before.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue’s movement techniques were just too domineering. Zhou Wen could only use half his movement techniques most of the time before the subsequent variations were made impossible by Xia Xuanyue. Therefore Zhou Wen had to use another move.</p>
<p>And this was only the beginning. Xia Xuanyue’s movement technique was like a fearless bandit that constantly repressed Zhou Wen, preventing him from completing a single move. Typically, he had no choice but to change his stance midway.</p>
<p>There was no trace of an immortal air in the Flying Immortal’s stance at all. Even that elegant feeling disappeared. The decadence made one uncomfortable just watching it.</p>
<p>If others could feel aggrieved seeing this, Zhou Wen felt even worse.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was the type of person who would take the risk. The more pressure Xia Xuanyue gave him, the more spirited he became. He had to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>The two of them fought silently in the cave. The space available to Zhou Wen was constantly squeezed and reduced. This was the first time he had encountered such a domineering movement technique. He felt like he had nowhere to go.</p>
<p>If it were someone with a weak will, they would probably give up on such a battle and fight Xia Xuanyue with brute force.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t do that. He continued searching for a way to break through Xia Xuanyue’s suppression.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue became more and more surprised. Zhou Wen was much younger than her—about ten years. He was about the same age as Xia Bing and company.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s determination was far beyond what Xia Bing and company could compare with.</p>
<p>Under her movement technique, even Xia Bing who was well-versed in the Path to Snatching Heaven could only last for a few minutes at most, and her mental fortitude would waver.</p>
<p>However, despite having fought her for so long, Zhou Wen remained highly focused. He constantly tried various methods to compete with her. He didn’t shrink back or risk his life irresponsibly. To be able to maintain such a firm attitude despite being constantly suppressed left Xia Xuanyue somewhat astonished.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder the An family thinks so highly of him. Just this firm willpower alone isn’t something an ordinary person can compare with. Resources can be obtained slowly. Essence Energy Arts, Companion Beasts, and so on can be slowly obtained. However, if a person’s willpower isn’t firm, no matter how many resources they have, it will be very difficult for them to achieve anything. If Zhou Wen doesn’t perish, he will definitely be a candidate to become a Mythical. Xia Xuanyue marveled inwardly.</p>
<p>Under Xia Xuanyue’s suppression, Zhou Wen’s Flying Immortal Stance constantly improved, becoming more and more otherworldly.</p>
<p>His heart calmed down as the pressure Xia Xuanyue exerted on him decreased.</p>
<p>When Xia Xuanyue saw that her Path to Snatching Heaven’s pressure on Zhou Wen was reducing, she raised the strength of her sword technique, instantly pressurizing Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, this pressure didn’t last long. Zhou Wen gradually stabilized the situation. His movement technique was becoming more and more extraordinary. It had the feeling of him ascending to the heavens, completely different from the previous Fairy movement technique.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue’s expression turned serious too. Xia Xuanyue, who had not used her Life Soul, started using her Life Soul.</p>
<p>A vertical eye appeared between her eyebrows. The eye did not have a pupil, but it was as clean as a mirror.</p>
<p>The moment Xia Xuanyue’s Life Soul appeared, Zhou Wen, who had stabilized the situation, was at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen felt like he was lacking in strength. No matter how he changed his movement technique or how perfectly he used the Flying Immortal Stance, he was still firmly suppressed by Xia Xuanyue.</p>
<p>The sword and person sent Zhou Wen into a repeated retreat. Even his path of retreat was sealed. It made Zhou Wen feel like he was trapped in a battle of beasts.</p>
<p>No… It still doesn’t work… Zhou Wen realized that no matter how he changed his movement technique, Xia Xuanyue seemed to be able to predict his movements and seal off all possibilities. It made Zhou Wen feel like a bird in a cage, or like a monkey in Buddha’s palm. He couldn’t escape no matter what.</p>
<p>This pressure was different from fighting a powerful Mythical creature. In his battle against a Mythical creature, he knew he was no match for it, so he could only do his best.</p>
<p>However, when facing Xia Xuanyue, he clearly felt that his strength was not any weaker than hers, but he felt as though he was restricted in every manner. It was as though countless invisible threads bound him, making it impossible for him to unleash his strength.</p>
<p>This sort of stifling feeling was worse than not having the ability to fight.</p>
<p>The Slaughterer Life Soul boosted Zhou Wen’s strength and speed, but it still wasn’t enough to break through Xia Xuanyue’s attacks. After repeatedly retreating, Zhou Wen was forced deep into the cave. Behind him was a stone wall, and there was more room for retreat.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue’s suppression continued. Even Xia Xuanyue had no choice but to admit that even among her peers, there weren’t many who could last so long under her sword.</p>
<p>This wasn’t a matter of strength, but the pressure one felt. It was very easy for others to give up on themselves and put their lives on the line.</p>
<p>And in a true battle between experts, every single move needed to be calculated. The so-called burst of strength and desperation never existed. The more impulsive one was, the more flaws one revealed—it made it easier to die.</p>
<p>Under extreme circumstances, the best solution was not to risk his life but to calm themselves down. Even when one was bleeding and injured, one had to constantly keep calm and think of a way to solve the problem. That was the only way out.</p>
<p>Under such pressure, Zhou Wen had already pushed the Flying Immortal Stance to its limits, but he was still unable to match up to Xia Xuanyue. This made him involuntarily think of the female immortal who had torn out of the door.</p>
<p>Perhaps only such a movement technique can break through the opponent’s suppression. Zhou Wen’s eyes burned as countless thoughts flashed through his mind.</p>
<h3 id='chapter528'>Chapter 528 Wanting to Win</h3>
<p>The image of the Fairy tearing out of the entrance had been replayed countless times in Zhou Wen’s mind. It wasn’t difficult to imitate the Fairy’s stance, but it was difficult for him to understand the insights and profundity within.</p>
<p>Through his understanding of the Flying Immortal Stance, Zhou Wen had gained some understanding of the fairy who tore out of the entrance. However, he didn’t know what effects these insights might have.</p>
<p>However, he was already in a desperate situation. Zhou Wen couldn’t care less. At the instant Xia Xuanyue’s Sword Technique sealed off all his escape routes, he used Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>This Transcendent Flying Immortal technique was completely different from the previous Transcendent Flying Immortal. Although the moves were the same, the concept was completely different.</p>
<p>In the past, Transcendent Flying Immortal was extremely domineering, but now, it had a free and unrestrained feeling that transcended the mortal world. If one had to use a single word to describe it, Zhou Wen felt that this was what a true “immortal” was. Immortals in the traditional view of East District definitely weren’t overbearing in a peerless manner.</p>
<p>Immortals and deities were two completely different concepts. The power represented by deities made them revered by others because of the authority they had in certain aspects; therefore, deities were rulers.</p>
<p>The Chinese character for ‘immortal’ was the word ‘human’ and ‘mountain’ combined. The original meaning was about people seeking transcendence in the mortals. Immortality was simply a pursuit, a form of growth. From a certain perspective, one could even say that they were completely different from the deities who represented power.</p>
<p>Previously, Transcendent Flying Immortal was overly domineering and was closer to a deity. Now, the Transcendent Flying Immortal that Zhou Wen was using had the air of an immortal.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue’s Life Soul was known as Catoptric Eyes. It could allow her to enter an extraordinary ethereal state. Under that ethereal state, not only could she strengthen her physique, but it could also allow her to possess the power of clairvoyance. Although she could not really see the future, she could foresee her opponent’s actions, but it was not 100% accurate.</p>
<p>Relying on the power of the Catoptric Eyes and the Path to Snatching Heaven, coupled with her outstanding sword techniques, Xia Xuanyue was a rather terrifying person in her generation. Some even believed that she could be compared to An Tianzuo, who was about the same age.</p>
<p>In fact, even amongst the older generation, there weren’t many who could match Xia Xuanyue, let alone her peers.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue had already pushed Zhou Wen to a corner and was just about to stop. She wasn’t really planning on fighting a life and death battle with Zhou Wen to begin with. She only felt that Zhou Wen desired more opportunities to use his movement technique. She also wanted to see how far he could go with it. Therefore, she took the initiative to be Zhou Wen’s sparring partner to force him to showcase his movement technique.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s performance had already surprised her. His movement technique was already comparable to the top movement techniques of the six families, but that was all.</p>
<p>Being able to match a top-notch movement technique didn’t mean that he could match a top-notch person. In fact, Zhou Wen’s movement technique wasn’t her match.</p>
<p>Just as she was about to stop, Xia Xuanyue’s pupils constricted. This was because her Catoptric Eyes suddenly seemed to lose their effect, preventing her from deducing Zhou Wen’s trajectory.</p>
<p>The Catoptric Eyes weren’t just having bouts of clairvoyance for no reason. An illusion that reflected in her eye constantly predicted her opponent’s reactions, allowing Xia Xuanyue to know what the opponent might do next so that she could be prepared in advance or deal with them in a targeted manner.</p>
<p>The deduction was extremely fast, just like a computer processing data. Feedback would appear in Xia Xuanyue’s mind in an instant. There was no need for complicated thoughts, as they could be synchronized with the battle.</p>
<p>However, the present situation was different. The Catoptric Eyes were unable to deduce Zhou Wen’s subsequent reactions. Or rather, there were too many subsequent reactions, so they were pointless as a reference.</p>
<p>Just like a person walking on a three-pronged road without considering the path they came from, Xia Xuanyue could easily determine which path the person would choose from the two paths. The chance of determining the correct path was very high, and it was also very easy to prepare for it. At most, she could make preparations for both paths.</p>
<p>But now, Zhou Wen seemed to be standing at a bustling fork with at least a hundred forks. Even if her Catoptric Eyes could deduce all the possibilities, it was meaningless. It would be impossible for Xia Xuanyue to seal off so many subsequent challenges.</p>
<p>The present Zhou Wen gave Xia Xuanyue such a feeling. His movement techniques appeared unpredictable, and even Xia Xuanyue couldn’t predict his trajectory.</p>
<p>At that moment, the boundary between the Dragon Gate Flying Immortal Art and the Transcendent Flying Immortal began to blur. There was no longer any difference between movement techniques and attack moves. It could be unleashed as he wished, but it possessed an unfathomable profundity.</p>
<p>Elegant!</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue could only use that word to describe Zhou Wen’s movement technique. Regardless of how domineering her sword techniques and Path to Snatching Heaven were, they didn’t seem to pose a threat to him.</p>
<p>And Zhou Wen’s casual actions made Xia Xuanyue feel immense pressure. Wherever his clothes passed, cracks would appear in the void.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue realized that she couldn’t keep up with Zhou Wen’s speed.</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but turn serious. She treated Zhou Wen as an equal, not like before when she only wanted to see what Zhou Wen could accomplish.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue’s movement technique was domineering and Zhou Wen’s movement technique was elegant. The two completely different movement techniques constantly clashed, benefiting Zhou Wen and Xia Xuanyue greatly.</p>
<p>In terms of talent, Xia Xuanyue was not weaker than anyone else. Not many people in the Xia Clan could master the Path to Snatching Heaven, and Xia Xuanyue had gained basic mastery when she was just twelve.</p>
<p>But at her current level, be it her Path to Snatching Heaven movement technique or her own level or realm, she had reached a bottleneck.</p>
<p>To advance to the Mythical stage from the Epic stage was as difficult as ascending to the heavens. It was already difficult enough to nurture a Mythical pet. It required large amounts of resources, but for humans to advance to the Mythical stage on their own, it was hundreds or thousands of times more difficult than nurturing a Mythical pet.</p>
<p>There were many members of the six families with resources and talent, but in all these years, how many people could truly advance to the Mythical stage?</p>
<p>With a perfect Life Soul, unparalleled movement and sword techniques, and a Mythical pet, Xia Xuanyue, who wasn’t even thirty years old, was already standing at the pinnacle of the human race.</p>
<p>It’s lonely at the top. In Xia Xuanyue’s eyes, it was not a compliment, but a sense of sorrow. She had no path to herself.</p>
<p>Therefore, even when she lost her Mythical Companion Beast, Xia Xuanyue didn’t think too much about it. This was because she was always stuck. Even if she waited for a few years for a Mythical Companion Beast, things would still be the same. It didn’t make much of a difference to her.</p>
<p>However, today’s battle with Zhou Wen had stirred up her long-awaited desire for victory and a breakthrough. Even her long-tired thoughts seemed to become active.</p>
<p>Victory had become a matter of course in the past few years, not a pursuit. However, Xia Xuanyue was trying to win now.</p>
<h3 id='chapter529'>Chapter 529 John“s Arrival</h3>
<p>With the sword and body combined, Xia Xuanyue fused her sword techniques and movement techniques into one, no longer separating them from each other. The body was the sword, and the sword was the body. Only then could she resist Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>The two of them gradually realized that although their movement techniques looked completely different and were even diametrically opposite, they also seemed to complement each other.</p>
<p>The Path to Snatching Heaven was created on the principle of human strength and the concept of taking fate into one’s hands. As for Zhou Wen’s concept of immortal, it was also a product of human pursuit for transcendence.</p>
<p>However, one was to conquer nature while the other was to return to nature. It could be said that the same pursuit had led to two completely different paths.</p>
<p>In a battle between two techniques, it was difficult to determine who was better. No one could gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>Both of them were pursuing a breakthrough and wanted to suppress each other. However, with every bit of insight they gained, they found their opponents were stronger than before. No matter how hard they tried, they could not defeat the other.</p>
<p>This was the first time they had encountered such a tenacious opponent. Each of them racked their brains, pushed themselves to the limits, and constantly gained revelations and countermeasures.</p>
<p>The two figures in the Lotus Flower Cave constantly intersected like two streams of light. Wherever the streams of light went, forces such as saber beams and sword beams followed. Just the force produced by the fluttering of clothes could easily cut through rocks, leaving behind marks like sword slashes.</p>
<p>Wherever the two of them went, the Fairy Beasts and Fairies were torn apart by the blade beams. The surrounding rocks also shattered, and the Lotus Flower Cave was battle-scarred.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already grasped the concept of the fairy who tore through the entrance. He could perfectly match it with Transcendent Flying Immortal, but he had ultimately failed to defeat Xia Xuanyue. He couldn’t help but wonder…</p>
<p>I wonder if it’ll work if I fuse the two different concepts of Fairy and Flying Immortal into Transcendent Flying Immortal! Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>This was definitely a crazy and bold idea. The moves were the same, but the concepts were different. It might not be impossible.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s mind was constantly bubbling as he waited for the opportunity.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue was also pondering. The Xia family was originally an ancient family in the East District. Before the dimensional storms, they had a deep cultural heritage.</p>
<p>Therefore, after the dimensional storms, the Xia family received Essence Energy Arts early. There were even many Essence Energy Arts and techniques that the Xia family had learned from ancient culture.</p>
<p>The Path to Snatching Heaven was an example. Many of the Xia family’s Essence Energy Arts were the same. Outsiders only believed that the Xia family was powerful because it had produced one of the Six Federation Heroes.</p>
<p>However, they didn’t know that even without the Xia family’s hero, they wouldn’t be any weaker.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Xia family had the confidence to abandon the famous Invincible Connate Divine Art. This was because even without the Invincible Connate Divine Art, the Essence Energy Art that the Xia family possessed was enough to make them stand tall in the world of experts.</p>
<p>The Essence Energy Art that Xia Xuanyue cultivated was one of the Essence Energy Arts that the Xia family had learned in ancient culture. It was called the “Great Emperor Sutra.”</p>
<p>However, as it was derived from ancient culture, it wasn’t as complete as a ready-made Essence Energy Art. After generations of the Xia family researched and improved it, the Great Emperor Sutra was completed in Xia Xuanyue’s generation, with the Mortal, Legendary, and Epic stage done.</p>
<p>However, after reaching the Epic stage, no one knew how to proceed. The Great Emperor Sutra did not have any subsequent followup, so they had to rely on themselves to figure things out.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue had been studying the Great Emperor Sutra, but her improvement was limited. In the past couple of years, she had completely stopped progressing. Even though she had read a lot of ancient books, trying to find a direction for a breakthrough through was minuscule.</p>
<p>However, the battle with Zhou Wen gave Xia Xuanyue new ideas.</p>
<p>How difficult is it to snatch paths from the Heavens? As the leader of the human race, the Emperor is the one who will face Heaven’s Path most directly… A thought was sprouting in Xia Xuanyue’s mind.</p>
<p>The two figures continued to clash. Suddenly, the two of them seemed to come to a tacit understanding and simultaneously withdrew from the battle. Both of them stood at the end of the cave and stared at their opponent. There seemed to be a strange energy brewing within their bodies, like the calm before the storm.</p>
<p>They were in one of the dimensionalized Lotus Flower Caves. On top of the cave was an intricate lotus flower pattern, and there was even a Fairy flying around it.</p>
<p>As the two of them stood in silence, a distorted space suddenly appeared in the middle of the lotus flower pattern. A creature emerged from the lotus flower, appearing right in the middle of the two of them.</p>
<p>It was a Fairy. When the Fairy appeared, a terrifying power suddenly erupted from within the cave.</p>
<p>In an instant, the Fairy seemed to be sliced apart by countless sword beams, turning into fragments. Zhou Wen and Xia Xuanyue’s auras were also stirred as they moved involuntarily.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body went from extreme stillness to extreme movement as he instantly streaked across the void. He looked elegant and graceful, but it made it impossible for anyone to react.</p>
<p>Despite being visible to the naked eye, one’s brain was unable to fire the order to react. One could only watch as the figure flitted away. The despair was enough to destroy a person’s soul.</p>
<p>However, not only did Xia Xuanyue react, but she also took a step forward. The sword intent on her seemed to shatter the heavens. With unparalleled conviction, she faced Zhou Wen’s terrifying strike.</p>
<p>Blood bloomed like flowers!</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue’s finger stopped at Zhou Wen’s glabella. As for Zhou Wen’s finger, it was stuck to Xia Xuanyue’s swan-like neck. Drops of blood slid down their fingers.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>John had come to Luoyang again. This was not his first time here, but his mood was completely different from the last time he came.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, it’s time for you to pay the price for your actions. John walked on Luoyang’s streets. His handsome angel-like face attracted the attention of the passers-by.</p>
<p>There were many handsome men, but they had never seen anyone as handsome as John.</p>
<p>However, John was completely different from the princely gentleman he used to be. There was no expression on his face, and he was as perfect as a sculpture. His every move was elegant and dignified.</p>
<p>“Mr. John, welcome to Luoyang.” An Sheng stood in front of the car and greeted John with a smile.</p>
<p>Although he wasn’t as handsome as John, for some reason he didn’t seem to pale in comparison when standing in front of him.</p>
<p>Two girls who stood on the street opposite them were momentarily lost as to who was more charming.</p>
<p>“Where’s Zhou Wen?” John looked at An Sheng and asked coldly. It was as though he held zero concern about anyone apart from Zhou Wen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter530'>Chapter 530 Divine Skill</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen returned to his dorm and looked at the blood-colored avatar’s information with his mysterious phone. He had a smile that appeared as though he had hit the lottery.</p>
<p>Transcendent Flying Immortal: Mythical</p>
<p>Just one word made Zhou Wen feel sweet inside and out. The Dragon Gate Fairy Skill and Dragon Gate Flying Immortal Skill he had learned previously had vanished, leaving behind only one Transcendent Flying Immortal skill.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this skill didn’t have any rank. What was even more strange was that there wasn’t any Essence Energy consumption.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen soon understood why Transcendent Flying Immortal didn’t have any Essence Energy expenditure. This was because he could use it as he wished. He could freely control how much Essence Energy he expended, so there was naturally no limit to it.</p>
<p>If only advancing to the Mythical stage could be as simple as that, Zhou Wen thought greedily.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, his Life Soul hadn’t advanced to the Perfect stage yet. It was too early to think about the Mythical stage. His most important Life Soul, Slaughterer, was still in its Primordial Body form and had yet to advance.</p>
<p>Regardless, having a divine skill raises my strength greatly. If I can train all my skills to a divine level, I’ll be really impressive. Zhou Wen tried some other skills and realized that it would be difficult for him to train his skills to Rank 10, much less advance to a Mythical level.</p>
<p>In fact, although a divine skill was much easier than advancing to the Mythical stage, not everyone could comprehend a divine skill at the Epic stage.</p>
<p>The reason Zhou Wen was able to comprehend it was partly because of his talent and partly because he had sufficient resources. If he didn’t have so many foundation skills or hadn’t watched the phenomenon of the fairy tearing out of the entrance, it would be impossible for him to advance to the Mythical level.</p>
<p>Another important reason was that his opponent was powerful enough. Moreover, his opponent’s technique was a perfect match for his Transcendent Flying Immortal. Both sides had gained new insights before he advanced to the Mythical level.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen guessed that Xia Xuanyue’s move had probably advanced to the Mythical level as well. However, she didn’t have the mysterious phone to read the information about herself. Even so, she likely knew deep down what had happened.</p>
<p>The heritage of the six families is truly terrifying. Just any random woman has such capabilities. Zhou Wen increasingly felt that the six families had a strong foundation.</p>
<p>However, he was thinking too much. Xia Xuanyue was a top expert among the six families. They weren’t as common as Zhou Wen imagined.</p>
<p>Just as he was admiring his divine skill, his phone suddenly rang. It was An Sheng.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, John has arrived in Luoyang. He came alone. He didn’t bring a single person from the Cape family,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that An Sheng meant that since John had dared to come to Luoyang alone, he definitely wasn’t completely unprepared. He was also reminding Zhou Wen to be careful.</p>
<p>How could An Sheng know that Zhou Wen was more careful than he imagined? This was because Zhou Wen knew that he wasn’t only facing John, but also the terrifying Thearch.</p>
<p>“Where’s the battle location? What time is it?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow. It’ll be held in the city’s arena. The venue has been set up. We definitely won’t let any external forces affect your battle with John. You can rest assured about this. We’ve even invited the Zhang family and the Xia family to watch the battle as witnesses to prevent the Cape family from making an issue afterward. People from the Dugu family will also come, but they haven’t arrived yet. They may appear tomorrow.” An Sheng explained the general situation.</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng, have you met John? Do you feel that he’s different from before?” When Zhou Wen asked this question, he was thinking about the words The Thearch had accidentally sent him.</p>
<p>“He’s indeed a little different. He looks very confident and his aura is very strong. It’s far from the standard of a Legendary. This person is definitely not simple,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Nothing else?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“What else?” An Sheng didn’t know what Zhou Wen was referring to.</p>
<p>“Do you feel that John’s looks, temper, or voice are different from before?” Zhou Wen didn’t know how to put it.</p>
<p>“His temper could be a little different from before. He looks cold, as though he doesn’t care about anything. He’s like a high and mighty god. The way he looks at us is like looking at ants,” An Sheng said after some thought.</p>
<p>“It’s not that. Let’s put it this way. Don’t you feel that he’s a little effeminate?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“Not really,” An Sheng said after some thought.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought, Could it be that The Thearch’s message wasn’t sent to John?</p>
<p>An Sheng said that he would pick Zhou Wen up tomorrow. He told him to make preparations for battle.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The biggest arena in Luoyang was mainly used for Companion Beasts to battle. It was mostly a performance-type battle, but the military had sealed the arena today. Only a few people who were invited could enter the arena.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue was among the crowd. As soon as she entered the arena, she saw a man with a sword on his back standing in front of the guardrail of the arena.</p>
<p>Dugu Ge? Xia Xuanyue was slightly surprised to see the man. She never expected him to come to Luoyang.</p>
<p>Dugu Ge was slightly older than Xia Xuanyue and An Tianzuo by a few years. He had just reached his thirties and Xia Xuanyue had always heard about this legend.</p>
<p>Among the six families, Dugu Ge had a very special nickname: “The only man in the Dugu family who doesn’t cower.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t that the men of the Dugu family were really cowardly. However, they specialized in movement techniques, so when others fought with the Dugu family, they couldn’t even touch their bodies. It was extremely depressing and humbling, which was why they mocked the Dugu family for being cowardly.</p>
<p>In such a family clan, Dugu Ge was quite different. He didn’t use his movement techniques to win battles. When he was out traveling, he had defeated the six families and made them accept the loss wholeheartedly. Among those around the same age as Dugu Ge, no one could beat him.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Dugu Ge was a little older than them and didn’t join the battle between An Tianzuo and the six families’ younger generation. The six families believed that Dugu Ge was definitely no weaker than An Tianzuo and might even be stronger.</p>
<p>Back when Dugu Ge went to the Xia family to challenge them, Xia Xuanyue was only ten years old. However, she had a deep impression of him because even her cousin, whom she had idolized since she was young, was unable to defeat Dugu Ge.</p>
<p>In recent years, she had rarely heard of Dugu Ge. She heard that he spent time conquering a large dimensional zone in the South District. She never expected to see him here.</p>
<p>“I remember you. You’re Loser’s sister, right?” Dugu Ge looked at Xia Xuanyue and recalled.</p>
<p>“My brother’s name is Xia Liuchuan, not Loser.” Xia Xuanyue said in a depressed tone.</p>
<p>“It’s all the same.” Dugu Ge said that and turned to look at the arena. He saw a handsome man standing in the arena.</p>
<p>“That young man from the Cape’s family is very scary,” Dugu Ge said to Xia Xuanyue.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue was slightly surprised. She didn’t expect Dugu Ge to have such a high opinion of John. It was truly terrifying for Dugu Ge to say the word ‘scary’.</p>
<h3 id='chapter531'>Chapter 531 Inside the Cocoon</h3>
<p>Xia Xuanyue could not help but look at John. Although he used to have the title of Saint, titles were just a joke in the six families.</p>
<p>Ignoring Xia Xuanyue’s generation, even amongst John’s peers, there was also a freak like Lance. John paled in comparison.</p>
<p>Now that John had actually been praised by Dugu Ge, Xia Xuanyue could not help but take a closer look at him.</p>
<p>John stood in the arena like an ancient Greek statue. Despite just standing there, he gave off a beautiful, holy feeling. His aura was indeed very strong, making him likely to be at the Epic stage. However, Xia Xuanyue did not know what horror Dugu Ge was referring to.</p>
<p>“Why do you say that?” Xia Xuanyue walked up to Dugu Ge and asked curiously.</p>
<p>“He has a special power,” Dugu Ge said as he looked at John.</p>
<p>“Special?” Xia Xuanyue did not understand what Dugu Ge meant by special.</p>
<p>Many Essence Energy Arts, Essence Energy Skills, Pets, Life Providences, and Life Souls could be called special powers. This description was just too general.</p>
<p>Dugu Ge said, “I entered a dimensional zone with Loser. In that dimensional zone, I found a black cocoon. Did he tell you about it?”</p>
<p>“No, but I’ve heard of such cocoons. The six families have similar records. There will be similar cocoons in certain mysterious dimensional zones. However, there will be powerful Mythical creatures nearby. No one knows what’s inside the cocoons. Most people have guessed that they might be the descendants of Mythical creatures,” said Xia Xuanyue.</p>
<p>“No, they are definitely not the descendants of ordinary Mythical creatures. Back then, Loser and I cracked a black cocoon and saw the creature inside. It was completely different from the Mythical creature that protected it. It was an even more terrifying existence,” Dugu Ge said as his gaze landed on John. He said affirmatively, “There’s a similar aura on John, but it’s not quite the same.”</p>
<p>“What kind of creature is it? Why has my brother never mentioned it?” Xia Xuanyue asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. We originally thought that with our strength and Mythical pets, it wouldn’t be difficult for us to take the black cocoon even if we couldn’t defeat the Mythical creature guarding it. In the end, we used all our strength and only managed to crack open a tiny hole. We were nearly killed by the creature outside the black cocoon. As for the creature inside the black cocoon, it just waved its hand,” Dugu Ge paused before continuing, “and Loser suffered serious injuries. You can say that we barely escaped death. He recuperated at my house for nearly six months before he recovered.”</p>
<p>“I remember now. A year ago, my brother went to the South District. He said that he would be traveling for a month or two, but he only came back after almost a year. It should be that time, right?” Xia Xuanyue paused for a moment before continuing, “Ever since he came back, my brother seems to have changed. He’s checking up on documents every day as if he’s researching something. He’s acting mysteriously. When I ask him, he doesn’t tell me what he’s studying.”</p>
<p>“It was probably then. Anyone who has seen such a terrifying creature would not be indifferent. However, it was too dangerous. He probably didn’t want you to worry and was afraid that you would stop him from going again. That’s why he didn’t tell you,” said Dugu Ge.</p>
<p>“You’re saying that John has the aura of that kind of creature?” Xia Xuanyue looked at John with a strange expression.</p>
<p>“Yes, but it’s different. I’m not sure if it’s the same aura,” Dugu Ge said.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?” A voice came from behind. A long-haired man in a robe walked over.</p>
<p>The man looked ordinary, but his eyes were exceptionally good-looking. They weren’t considered big, nor were they double eyelids, but the contours were especially aesthetic.</p>
<p>“Zhang Chunqiu, why are you willing to come out?” Dugu Ge looked at the man in surprise.</p>
<p>Dugu Ge hadn’t lost when he challenged the young scions of the six families years ago. However, there were also people who could fight him to a draw. Zhang Chunqiu was one of them.</p>
<p>In that era, the geniuses of the six families were numerous. They were known as the Golden Generation. Perhaps that generation had used up all the luck of the six families, and with four to five years as a demarcation line, the number of outstanding people who were born after that was few and far between. When it came to John’s generation, only Lance was outstanding, while the others were lacking.</p>
<p>On the contrary, amazing geniuses outside of the six great family clans appeared.</p>
<p>“The An family requested our Zhang family to bear witness, so I came.” Zhang Chunqiu walked to Dugu Ge’s side and sat down in the spectator stand.</p>
<p>“Over such a small event, you came instead of Zhang Xiao?” Dugu Ge didn’t believe it.</p>
<p>“The world hasn’t been peaceful recently, and the Fiend Tomb has been stirring. With the appearance of the black cubes, I feel like something big is about to happen, so I came out to take a look,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“Something happened with the Fiend Tomb?” Dugu Ge and Xia Xuanyue were shocked.</p>
<p>They knew that the Zhang family had been guarding the Fiend Tomb for years. Many generations of people had ended up being buried there, which was why the creatures in the Fiend Tomb were unable to cause trouble in the human world.</p>
<p>If something really happened to the Fiend Tomb, the Zhang family would definitely be affected.</p>
<p>“It’s temporarily stabilized, so I can come out for a walk.” Zhang Chunqiu’s gaze landed on John, and his eyes narrowed slightly. “This John has something interesting about him.”</p>
<p>“You can tell, too?” Dugu Ge sat down beside Zhang Chunqiu.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue also sat down. Compared to Zhang Chunqiu and Dugu Ge’s generation, her talent and strength were not inferior. However, she lacked their experience.</p>
<p>Years ago, there were very few Mythical Companion Eggs amongst the six families. It was unlike now where they could just give Xia Xuanyue a Mythical Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Back then, if they wanted a Mythical Companion Egg, they had to take the risk in the dimensional zones. This resulted in a difference in experience.</p>
<p>However, their generation was also the most tragic generation when it came to deaths. Very few managed to retrieve Mythical Creatures alive.</p>
<p>“I just came to take a look since it’s along the way. I didn’t expect to see anything so interesting. However, his opponent is a little weak. I wonder if he can force that thing out,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“Not necessarily. Although I don’t know how terrifying that thing is, John’s opponent is definitely not weak,” Xia Xuanyue said.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu smiled. “Zhou Wen should be Wang Mingyuan’s student, right? Speaking of which, I really wanted to meet Wang Mingyuan. Unfortunately, I missed the opportunity.”</p>
<p>Dugu Ge said, “To be able to defeat Lance, he can’t be weak. However, he hasn’t had much time to grow. I wonder how far he has progressed.”</p>
<p>As the trio spoke, Zhou Wen entered the venue. Everyone couldn’t help but look over.</p>
<h3 id='chapter532'>Chapter 532 The Appearance of the Six-Winged Seraphim</h3>
<p>“Tsk, look at his Life Providence. He’s indeed extraordinary. It’s not easy to have one even among the six families,” Zhang Chunqiu said with narrowed eyes as he sized up Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“This person’s aura is deep and reserved, and his eyes are resolute. If he doesn’t die, he will definitely be able to achieve something in the future.” Dugu Ge nodded.</p>
<p>“In recent years, outstanding talents have appeared from all over the world. On the contrary, although there are many talented people born in our six families, they lack the light from providence and perseverance,” Zhang Chunqiu sighed.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue and Dugu Ge remained silent. What Zhang Chunqiu said was something that they were all worried about. The six families seemed to be getting worse with each generation, and they no longer seemed favored by providence.</p>
<p>However, this was a problem that no one could solve. If one’s son was lacking, the father could only worry.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, we finally meet again.” John was standing quietly in the square with his eyes closed. The moment Zhou Wen stepped into the venue, he opened his eyes and stared intently at him.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to see you that much.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he couldn’t help but glance at John’s crotch.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he couldn’t see anything through his clothes. Of course, Zhou Wen only subconsciously took a glance. He didn’t really want to see anything that burned his eyes, so he didn’t use Truth Listener’s hearing ability to take a gander at that spot.</p>
<p>“From today onwards, you probably won’t have the chance to see me again. Today, I’m going to make you repay what you owe me and my sister, along with the interest. I’ll let you have a taste of having your Essence Energy sea crippled. That feeling of living a life worse than death,” John said coldly.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I’ll disappoint you,” Zhou Wen said firmly.</p>
<p>It was easy to kill Zhou Wen, but it was impossible to cripple his Essence Energy sea because he didn’t have any.</p>
<p>John didn’t say a word as he walked towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>An Sheng led many soldiers to guard the stands and he watched every action.</p>
<p>In the An family’s study, An Tianzuo was watching the battle through the surveillance footage from his phone.</p>
<p>In the cave in Chess Mountain, The Thearch was also looking at her phone. The scene was the same as An Tianzuo’s phone.</p>
<p>“You won’t be able to escape from my palm.” Upon seeing Zhou Wen on the screen, The Thearch’s seductive eyes narrowed slightly.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, accept the judgment of God,” John said as he raised his hand up high. Holy light spewed out from his hand and transformed into a towering Blade of Holy Light that slashed down at Zhou Wen. It was the famous Holy Light Judgment of the Cape family. One had to possess the hero bloodline of the Cape family to cultivate this terrifying Essence Energy Skill.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen this move before, but it wasn’t as terrifying as it was now. Clearly, John’s strength had already reached the peak of the Epic stage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no intention of retreating. He also raised his arm and slashed out a blood-colored wheel. It was none other than the Demonic Astral Wheel.</p>
<p>The blood-red wheel of light collided with the Blade of Holy Light and shattered with a terrifying explosion. The light blade and the light wheel tore apart, forming a shock wave that directly lifted the ground of the arena. The surface of the steel-concrete structure ebbed like a wave.</p>
<p>With just one strike, the ground was destroyed.</p>
<p>“Not bad. At this age, he has already reached the Epic stage. He’s much stronger than we were back then,” said Zhang Chunqiu with a smile.</p>
<p>Dugu Ge nodded slightly. “He’s indeed very strong. I wonder if he has a Mythical Companion Beast?”</p>
<p>“It’s hard to say. An Tianzuo is a little terrifying. Perhaps he can get a Mythical Companion Egg for Zhou Wen,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>In the arena, John waved his arms. He repeatedly cast Holy Light Judgment attacks at him. Such a terrifying power seemed to be casually unleashed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no intention of drawing his saber. At the same time, he brandished the Demonic Astral Wheel to fight John, shattering all the Holy Light Judgment attacks.</p>
<p>Dugu Ge and the others originally thought that such a battle would not last for long because the Holy Light Judgment consumed a huge amount of Essence Energy. Even with the hero bloodline and constitution of the Cape family, it was impossible to use it multiple times.</p>
<p>Although they had never seen Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy Skill before, it was clearly an extremely draining Essence Energy Skill for it to be able to resist the Holy Light Judgment. It also couldn’t be delivered forever.</p>
<p>But soon, they were surprised to discover that both John and Zhou Wen were able to continuously slash out Essence Energy Skills without any signs of exhaustion. In a blink of an eye, more than ten Holy Light Judgment attacks and Demonic Astral Wheels were slashed out.</p>
<p>The entire arena was a mess. The terrifying collision created huge craters in the ground.</p>
<p>Seeing that Holy Light Judgment couldn’t gain the upper hand, John didn’t plan on continuing. He stopped and stared at Zhou Wen. “I never expected you to come this far. It looks like I’ve underestimated you.”</p>
<p>“Your improvement isn’t slow either, but is that all?” Zhou Wen stared at John.</p>
<p>Although repeated unleashing of such Essence Energy attacks was indeed very powerful, it was nothing to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>If John had really contacted The Thearch, his strength wouldn’t be that simple. After all, The Thearch knew that Zhou Wen had two Mythical pets—Six-Winged and Truth Listener.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, The Thearch still believed that he was no match for John and even wanted him to beg for mercy at Chess Mountain. No matter how he thought about it, it was impossible for John’s strength to be limited to this.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen also sensed a familiar yet unfamiliar aura from John.</p>
<p>John didn’t fly into a rage because of Zhou Wen’s provocation. His expression didn’t change as he looked up at the sky and said, “Zhou Wen, you were indeed stronger than me in the past. You are indeed a genius. Even I have to admire you for reaching such a level in such a short period of time.”</p>
<p>“What you said is rather pertinent,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>John continued expressionlessly, “But it’s different now. No matter how talented you are and how hard you work, you’re ultimately a mere mortal.”</p>
<p>“As for me, I’m the one chosen by God. I’ll become God.” John’s eyes turned fervent as a terrifying holy light rose from his body. White holy light illuminated the entire arena. The ordinary soldiers could not even open their eyes.</p>
<p>“What’s that? A Mythical Companion Beast?” When the light weakened, everyone stared at the spot behind John in shock.</p>
<p>A six-winged seraphim with holy light was floating behind him.</p>
<p>When the ordinary soldiers saw the six-winged seraphim, they actually had the urge to kneel and worship it.</p>
<p>Dugu Ge and Zhang Chunqiu looked at each other and saw the surprise and excitement in each other’s eyes. They had clearly realized something.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also stared at the six-winged seraphim. He also sensed that there was something amiss with the six-winged seraphim’s aura. It wasn’t an ordinary Companion Beast, but it was somewhat similar to the creatures inside the white cocoons.</p>
<p>“What a terrifying aura. Is it a Mythical Companion Beast?” Xia Xuanyue had never seen the creatures inside the cocoons, so she naturally didn’t know what it was.</p>
<p>“No, that’s an existence even more terrifying than a Mythical Companion Beast,” said Dugu Ge.</p>
<p>“Could it be…” Xia Xuanyue immediately guessed what it was.</p>
<p>533 Mythical Power</p>
<p>John opened his arms as though he was hugging the sky. The six-winged seraphim transformed into feathers that flew towards his body, turning into an angel armor that enveloped John’s body.</p>
<p>However, that angelic armor seemed to grow on John’s body and had already become a part of him. The six wings of the seraphim angel unfurled behind him, exuding a holy glow. Together with the holy armor and his handsome face, he really looked like a god.</p>
<p>Everyone’s eyes were focused on John. Even a blind man could sense the terrifying energy fluctuations emanating from him.</p>
<p>“Is that the creature inside the cocoon? It doesn’t look like a Companion Beast, but it seems different from ordinary dimensional creatures.” Xia Xuanyue frowned as she pondered.</p>
<p>Dugu Ge and Zhang Chunqiu looked at John without saying a word, but the look in their eyes was a little strange.</p>
<p>An Sheng looked at Zhou Wen worriedly. John’s situation was indeed a little odd. He wasn’t sure if Zhou Wen could handle it.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo looked at the surveillance footage on his phone and frowned.</p>
<p>The six angelic wings on John’s back flapped slightly as his body floated in midair. He looked coldly at Zhou Wen and said, “Zhou Wen, I’ll tell you now what the difference between a god and a human is.”</p>
<p>With that said, John extended his hand and aimed his palm at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>John shot out a beam of light from his palm. It was unbelievably fast, as though it was holy light that could destroy everything.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The entire arena exploded like a volcanic eruption. The protective shield shattered and the arena shook.</p>
<p>“Mythical power,” Dugu Ge said with a serious expression.</p>
<p>“It’s indeed power at the Mythical stage.” Zhang Chunqiu nodded slightly.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue had had a Mythical Companion Beast before and knew that John’s strike was definitely at the Mythical stage. She couldn’t help but be alarmed.</p>
<p>The strength at the Mythical stage wasn’t new, but typically speaking, it was released from a Mythical Companion Beast. However, John released the strike himself; it wasn’t a Companion Beast’s strength.</p>
<p>There was a huge difference. No matter how powerful a Companion Beast was, it was only a tool. It was like a firearm. The person who used the firearm didn’t become stronger.</p>
<p>But now, John displayed strength that showed that he had become much stronger. Not only did he improve his destructive power, but his physical constitution had also increased to another level.</p>
<p>The explosion dimmed and everyone immediately realized that Zhou Wen hadn’t been injured by the terrifying force. A gigantic white six-winged dragon appeared in front of him. It was the dragon that had blocked John’s attack.</p>
<p>“Six-Winged Guardian Dragon? So that’s Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast!” Dugu Ge said in surprise.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue and Zhang Chunqiu were somewhat surprised. They never expected the first Mythical Companion Beast on the ranking to belong to Zhou Wen. They originally imagined that it belonged to a local bigwig.</p>
<p>Inside Chess Mountain, The Thearch saw Zhou Wen’s Six-Winged Guardian Dragon through the video on her phone. She curled her lips and said, “Isn’t it a little too naive to use a Six-Winged Guardian Dragon to fight a Guardian?”</p>
<p>John looked at the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon and said coldly, “So that Six-Winged Guardian Dragon belongs to you. Unfortunately, even if you have a powerful Mythical pet, it’s impossible to change the fate of defeat.”</p>
<p>With that said, John made the sign of the cross on the front of his chest. The six wings on his back glowed brightly as terrifying energy fluctuations condensed once again, bursting forth with even more terrifying light waves than before.</p>
<p>The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon roared as the sanctified body burst forth with a blazing-white flame, colliding with John’s beam.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The two forces collided and exploded. The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s huge body tore open a deep ditch on the ground. It retreated more than ten meters before finally stopping.</p>
<p>The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon roared angrily. It flapped its six wings and charged towards John.</p>
<p>John’s expression did not change, but his body disappeared as if he had teleported. When he reappeared, he was already in front of the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. Using terrifying holy light, his fist struck the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s chin.</p>
<p>The massive body of the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon was thrown in the air by the uppercut.</p>
<p>John’s figure flashed again and he arrived in front of the Six-Winged Dragon that was rising up like a ray of light. He punched out expressionlessly, causing the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon to sway left and right. Dragon blood spewed wildly from its mouth, and finally, John punched its head and sent it flying.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon crashed into the spectator stands, causing half of the arena to collapse.</p>
<p>The thing An Sheng was worried about happened in the end. Even the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon couldn’t match John. John, who was floating in the air, was now like a saint that had descended upon the world to represent God.</p>
<p>“What are your thoughts on this?” Dugu Ge asked Zhang Chunqiu.</p>
<p>“Very strong, but it’s still within the scope of a Mythical stage,” Zhang Chunqiu said after some thought.</p>
<p>Dugu Ge nodded in agreement before saying, “Unfortunately, Zhou Wen’s Mythical Companion Beast has been defeated. He shouldn’t be able to continue fighting. It will be difficult for him to force out the full strength of that thing.”</p>
<p>“It’s indeed a pity.” Zhang Chunqiu also felt that the duel would come to an end.</p>
<p>“I don’t think Zhou Wen will admit defeat so easily,” Xia Xuanyue suddenly said.</p>
<p>“Although that Six-Winged Guardian Dragon still has the ability to fight, there’s no point in continuing the battle. It will ultimately lose,” Dugu Ge said.</p>
<p>He was mistaken. Xia Xuanyue’s comment about Zhou Wen not admitting defeat wasn’t because the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon still had the ability to do combat. She was referring to Zhou Wen himself.</p>
<p>However, Xia Xuanyue knew that there was no point in explaining, so she decided not to say anything, and continued watching patiently.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, do you now know the difference between a god and a human? Even if you can advance to the Epic stage and possess a Mythical pet, you are still an ant in front of God.” John wasn’t in a hurry to cripple Zhou Wen. He wanted Zhou Wen to completely collapse in despair.</p>
<p>The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon crawled up from the collapsed pit and roared as it charged forward. However, Zhou Wen extended his hand and beckoned for it. The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon transformed into six Holy Flaming Dragon Wings that appeared behind him.</p>
<p>Although the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon still had the ability to fight, its Strength, Speed, and other aspects were inferior to John’s. There was no point in continuing the battle.</p>
<p>“I don’t see a god. I only see a lunatic with greater strength,” Zhou Wen said indifferently as he looked at John.</p>
<p>His words made Dugu Ge laugh. “This Zhou Wen is rather interesting. I’m beginning to like him.”</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu also said with a smile, “He’s right. John’s strength has only reached the peak of a divine level, but his realm and technique haven’t reached that stage. It’s indeed a little too arrogant to say that he’s God. However, sometimes, when the difference in strength reaches a certain level, even if the opponent is stupid, it’s still very difficult to win.” </p>
<h3 id='chapter534'>Chapter 534 Holy Angel“s Redemption</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen’s words didn’t anger John. John only sneered and said, “Then, let’s give it a try and see how strong the lunatic you’re talking about is.”</p>
<p>With that said, John’s figure instantly appeared in front of Zhou Wen with a flash of light. His palm, brimming with holy light, grabbed at Zhou Wen’s neck at an unbelievable speed.</p>
<p>The dragon wings on Zhou Wen’s back flapped as he used his movement technique to dodge John’s palm. However, he didn’t have any intention of retaliating. All he did was smile at John.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you draw your saber?” John asked as he stared at the Bamboo Blade at Zhou Wen’s waist.</p>
<p>“If I use my saber, you would have already been defeated. What’s the point?” Zhou Wen said seriously.</p>
<p>“Even I like him a little now. I thought that only people from our Zhang family would be so good at bragging.” Zhang Chunqiu laughed.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, An Sheng’s heart relaxed, but he was still worried for him.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo frowned and muttered to himself, “What an arrogant brat.”</p>
<p>John’s pupils constricted when he heard that, but he didn’t fly into a rage. He just stared coldly at Zhou Wen and said, “I hope you still have the courage to say those words later.”</p>
<p>With that said, without waiting for Zhou Wen to react, holy light erupted from his body. Six angelic wings extended horizontally as his body suspended in the air like a javelin. He looked like a humanoid cross as his whole body emitted a terrifying glow.</p>
<p>Beams of light erupted from his body, enveloping the entire fighting arena like a storm. Each sword beam contained an unmatchable amount of power of holy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression didn’t change as he flapped his six wings behind him. His body fluttered gracefully amidst the rain of light swords. It didn’t seem as though he was fast, but he managed to dodge the rain of light swords.</p>
<p>Rumble!</p>
<p>The light sword rain landed on the ground and blasted the ground. Every light sword had the power of the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu suddenly looked at Dugu Ge and said, “Is this Zhou Wen your Dugu family’s illegitimate son?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Dugu Ge asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“If not, why would he have such a freakish movement technique? Such a movement technique probably surpasses the other families. Only your Dugu family can compete with him in terms of movement techniques.” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>Dugu Ge stared at Zhou Wen for a long while before saying, “His movement technique is indeed impressive, but it’s not our Dugu family’s style.”</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu nodded and said, “Although Zhou Wen is a little arrogant, what he said wasn’t wrong. Compared to him, John’s physical constitution is only slightly better. He’s slightly stronger and faster. If his constitution were at the same level, John would probably be defeated by him in seconds. The An family has really picked up a treasure this time. It’s no wonder they would rather offend the Senate to protect Zhou Wen.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, but you and I know very well that John’s strength is immensely powerful. These techniques aren’t enough to make up for the gap between them. Under such inequality, it’d be fine even if John made a hundred mistakes. If Zhou Wen makes one mistake, he might die,” Dugu Ge said seriously.</p>
<p>“Let’s wait and see. I just find this Zhou Wen more and more interesting. It’s no wonder he can become friends with my sister,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“Huh? Your little princess actually has a friend?” Dugu Ge and Xia Xuanyue widened their eyes as if they had heard something unbelievable.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu seemed to know that he had said something wrong and could only say, “They only met a few times by chance, but their relationship isn’t bad. I came to see what kind of person Zhou Wen is.”</p>
<p>“You were worried that Zhou Wen would get close to your family’s little princess and are afraid that he has other motives, so you came to investigate, right?” Dugu Ge said with a twitch of his lips.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu smiled and said, “Don’t make it sound so bad. I just came to take a look.”</p>
<p>Seeing that the light sword rain wasn’t able to injure Zhou Wen, the angelic wings on John’s back spewed out terrifying flames, propelling his body to move at high speed as he slashed at Zhou Wen with terrifying power.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no intention of retaliating. All he did was constantly use his movement technique to dodge John’s barrage of attacks.</p>
<p>John’s every strike was extremely terrifying, reducing the arena into pieces. The ordinary soldiers guarding here had already retreated from the arena under An Sheng’s orders. They waited outside the arena while only An Sheng and a few Epic experts remained inside to guard the arena.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue and the rest had no choice but to retreat a little, before reaching the wall at the back of the arena to avoid being caught in the crossfire of the terrifying battle.</p>
<p>“What a powerful force. The power the six-winged seraphim gave John really makes me envious,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“No matter how strong the power is, it depends on who’s using it. John clearly doesn’t have the ability to use such power. It’s a complete waste. If it were me, I would have long beaten Zhou Wen to the ground,” said Dugu Ge.</p>
<p>“Not necessarily.” Xia Xuanyue unhappily disagreed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s movement technique had been upgraded alongside her. If Dugu Ge said that Zhou Wen was lacking, wouldn’t it also mean she was lacking?</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu praised, “Zhou Wen’s movement technique is truly powerful. Under such a huge disparity in strength, he hasn’t been injured at all. I’ve only seen such movement techniques in your Dugu family before.”</p>
<p>Under John’s storm-like attacks, Zhou Wen’s body flew up. He didn’t seem to be fast, but John didn’t even touch his clothes.</p>
<p>John was very calm in the beginning. He wanted to use various techniques and Essence Energy Skills to hit Zhou Wen, but no matter what technique or Essence Energy Skill he used, he failed to injure him at all.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you should be proud to be able to let me use the power that truly belongs to God.” John stopped his attack as his eyes shimmered. The six angelic wings unfurled behind him like a blooming flower.</p>
<p>“Is it finally coming?” Zhang Chunqiu stopped smiling and stared at John solemnly.</p>
<p>Dugu Ge’s expression turned serious as he stared at John without a word.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue did the same. They knew very well that physical constitution was only one aspect of the difference between the Mythical stage and the Epic stage. It wasn’t a very important aspect.</p>
<p>The true gap between the Mythical stage and the Epic stage was the miraculous power of the Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>Although the Wheel of Destiny of every Mythical creature was different, there was a commonality. The miraculous power was something that no living creature under the Mythical stage could withstand.</p>
<p>The holy light that erupted from John’s body intensified. The six angelic wings on his back turned into an ancient door of light.</p>
<p>“A miracle… Holy Angel’s Redemption…” With John’s mighty voice, the door of light behind him slowly opened, and a brilliant holy light shot out from it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter535'>Chapter 535 Are There Conditions?</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to dodge it, but the light that shot out from the door of light was at literally the speed of light. Unless Zhou Wen’s speed reached the speed of light, it was impossible for him to dodge.The light shone on Zhou Wen as his strength erupted. He wore his heavy armor and soft armor as he attempted to forcefully tank the light.</p>
<p>However, the resplendent light didn’t harm his body. It only made Zhou Wen feel an irresistible force pulling him towards the door of light.</p>
<p>Others only saw Zhou Wen being illuminated by the door’s light before flying towards it.</p>
<p>An Sheng’s expression changed. Although he didn’t know what was inside the door of light, he knew that he couldn’t let Zhou Wen take the risk. He flew into the arena.</p>
<p>A few Epic officers in charge of managing the situation rushed over with An Sheng.</p>
<p>“Please stop. I admit defeat for Zhou Wen.” As An Sheng charged at Zhou Wen, he shouted at John.</p>
<p>A cold glint flashed in John’s eyes as the door of light opened. The light shot towards An Sheng and company.</p>
<p>An Sheng’s gaze focused. At the instant the light scattered, he reached out and pressed down on the ground. His body instantly drilled underground, but the few Epic officers were illuminated by the light. They couldn’t help but fly into the door of light. No matter how they struggled, it was useless.</p>
<p>An Sheng, who had drilled underground, appeared from another side. The light from the door scattered down again, sucking him up.</p>
<p>“It’s over. John is indeed at the true Mythical stage. That should be the power of the Wheel of Destiny,” Zhao Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“It’s truly shocking that the creature inside a cocoon is able to make a person who recently had his Essence Energy sea crippled become a Mythical expert,” said Dugu Ge after some thought.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue was hesitant, unsure if she should help Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried several methods, but he failed to escape the power of the light. He slowly flew towards the door of light.</p>
<p>There was a bright divine light inside the door of light. Although he couldn’t see what was inside, he was certain that there would definitely be a great horror there. If he was pulled into it, he would probably die.</p>
<p>Truth Listener’s Evil Nullification Life Soul didn’t work. Zhou Wen switched his Essence Energy Art to Dao Body, and Zero Taboo immediately lit up like a light bulb.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, the irresistible suction force from the light disappeared.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen remained unperturbed as he continued slowly flying towards the door of light.</p>
<p>“John, do you really want to kill me?” Zhou Wen asked John.</p>
<p>“You will get off lightly if you just die,” John said coldly.</p>
<p>“If you want to kill me, do it. They have nothing to do with this. Let them go,” Zhou Wen added.</p>
<p>“They deserve death for protecting you. Besides, it’s An Sheng who crippled my sister’s Essence Energy sea. He naturally has to repay the debt,” said John.</p>
<p>“In that case, it’s either you die or I die today!” Zhou Wen gripped the Bamboo Blade tightly.</p>
<p>“There’s only your death. I will not die. You don’t have the right to talk about life and death with God. Go to heaven in peace. That’s your final escape.” John stood in front of the door of light and stretched out his hand like a messenger welcoming a soul into heaven.</p>
<p>“I don’t plan on going to a place like heaven. Can you pass the message to the owner of Heaven? Tell him to visit me in the mortal world when he has the time.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he had already arrived in front of the door of light. With the Bamboo Blade in hand, he pulled out his saber.</p>
<p>With all his Strength, Speed, and Essence Energy erupting, he delivered a full-powered strike. Zhou Wen’s figure streaked across the void.</p>
<p>John’s eyes widened as though he couldn’t believe that Zhou Wen could still launch an attack despite the Holy Angel’s Redemption. He wanted to move and resist the strike.</p>
<p>However, he realized that although he had seen the saber, his brain’s reaction speed was unable to keep up with it. He could only watch helplessly as the saber sliced at his neck, but he could not move. His face was twisted with horror.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time Zhou Wen attacked, a white figure with a blood beam behind him tore through the air and landed on the outer wall of the arena. It was none other than An Tianzuo, who had fused with his Life Soul.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue, Dugu Ge, and Zhang Chunqiu also looked at Zhou Wen’s strike in shock. According to what they knew, a creature that wasn’t a Mythical existence should not have the ability to resist a Wheel of Destiny’s miracle. They found it unbelievable that Zhou Wen could actually swing his saber amidst the miracle.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the strike was so fast and stunning. It seemed to exceed the speed of the Epic stage. Only Xia Xuanyue understood that Zhou Wen’s move had reached the level of a Mythical technique.</p>
<p>John was too close to Zhou Wen. Even though he had divine-level speed, he still couldn’t dodge Zhou Wen’s strike.</p>
<p>However, she was also astonished. Even if it was a divine technique, it was impossible for it to violate the miraculous power of the Wheel of Destiny. There had to be other reasons why Zhou Wen could slash out with his saber in the Holy Angel’s Redemption. Even Xia Xuanyue couldn’t guess the reason.</p>
<p>Wherever the blade beam passed, red blood bloomed like flowers on the parts of John’s neck that weren’t protected by the angel armor.</p>
<p>John covered his neck with his hand as he stared at Zhou Wen in disbelief. The six angelic wings on his back had stopped circulating as the door of light shattered and dissipated.</p>
<p>An Sheng and the others who had been sucked up by the light recovered their control and landed in the ruined arena. They looked at Zhou Wen and John in shock.</p>
<p>John held his neck, but blood continued gushing out. He wanted to say something and opened his mouth but did not make a sound. Blood gushed out.</p>
<p>The ferocious-looking John suddenly released the hand that was covering his neck and pounced at Zhou Wen, as though he wanted to fight him to the death.</p>
<p>However, when he pounced at Zhou Wen, the angelic armor on his body automatically dispelled and returned to the six-winged seraphim form as it floated in the air.</p>
<p>Having lost the power of the six-winged seraphim, John, who was already badly injured, fell from the sky before he could reach Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>John slammed heavily onto the ground and struggled to get up. His eyes stared intently at the six-winged seraphim who floated in the air. He was filled with confusion, puzzlement, anger, indignation, and many other emotions.</p>
<p>The six-winged seraphim that he had relied on, had betrayed him at the last moment.</p>
<p>“In the name of an angel, I bestow upon you the right to be protected. Human, are you willing to fight me and make me your guardian?”</p>
<p>John spat out a few mouthfuls of blood when he heard the six-winged seraphim’s words. He never expected such a thing to happen. He had abandoned everything to gain the six-winged seraphim as his guardian. Now, it had abandoned him to pledge its allegiance with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Are there conditions for you to become my guardian?” Zhou Wen’s mind flashed with The Thearch’s words as he subconsciously asked.</p>
<p>“There are no conditions. As long as you are willing, I will become your guardian and bestow you with the power of God,” the six-winged seraphim replied without hesitation.</p>
<p>Pfft!</p>
<p>When John heard this, he could no longer hold it in. He stood up abruptly and widened his eyes. He stretched out his trembling fingers and pointed at the six-winged seraphim in the sky. He opened his mouth as though he wanted to curse, but when he opened it again, blood spewed out and splattered everywhere.</p>
<h3 id='chapter536'>Chapter 536 Guardian</h3>
<p>“How do I know that you won’t treat me like you treated John?” Zhou Wen said to the six-winged seraphim.“Guardians are born to fight. If you lose in battle, what’s the point of me staying with you? As long as you have the ability to fight again, I will always protect you,” the six-winged seraphim said.</p>
<p>“What you said makes sense. Then what should I do to make you my guardian?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“It’s very simple. All you need to do is drip a drop of blood into my palm and then let me complete the ritual,” the six-winged seraphim said as he extended his palm.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen cut his finger and extended his hand towards the six-winged seraphim’s palm. Seeing the drop of blood on his finger about to land on the six-winged seraphim’s palm, the Bamboo Blade in his left hand slashed at the six-winged angel’s neck like a bolt of lightning.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The wings behind the six-winged seraphim protected his body like an umbrella, blocking Zhou Wen’s strike. At the same time, he rapidly retreated.</p>
<p>“Human, you are too emotional.” The six-winged seraphim moved backward.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen slashed at the six-winged seraphim again and again. The six-winged seraphim was different from Companion Beasts. Companion Beasts were completely controlled by their owners, but the six-winged seraphim could abandon its master and had its own consciousness. No matter how powerful he was, Zhou Wen wouldn’t take him along with him.</p>
<p>He had too many secrets. In the future, once the six-winged seraphim betrayed him, those secrets would be exposed. Zhou Wen definitely wouldn’t let such a thing happen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Transcendent Flying Immortal in a bid to kill the six-winged seraphim, but he realized that without John’s control, the six-winged seraphim was even stronger than when John used him. His figure moved in midair, leaving behind afterimages. Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal could only slash at his phantom. After slashing several times, he had failed to touch the six-winged seraphim.</p>
<p>“Human, you will soon learn what you have missed. When the time comes, you will regret everything you have done today.” The six-winged seraphim flew backward, but his speed was terrifyingly fast. He flapped his six wings and left the arena as though he had teleported, disappearing very quickly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned slightly as he looked at John and found that he had already fainted. An Sheng’s men were checking his injuries.</p>
<p>“How do you plan on disposing of him?” An Sheng walked to Zhou Wen’s side and asked.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“The video of your conversation with him was recorded. Even if you kill him, it’s just self-defense. The Cape family can’t say anything. However, killing him is meaningless. If you don’t mind, I hope to let him live and obtain information about the six-winged seraphim from him,” An Sheng whispered.</p>
<p>“Then do as you see fit. Give me a copy of the information if you manage to get anything. I’ll head back now,” Zhou Wen said as he turned and left the arena.</p>
<p>On the outer wall of the arena, Zhang Chunqiu looked at An Tianzuo, who was dressed in military uniform, and said with a smile, “Overseer An, congratulations to your An family for obtaining another powerful general.”</p>
<p>“He’s just an ordinary student at Sunset College. He’s not worthy of Brother Zhang’s claim of general,” An Tianzuo said indifferently before saying, “If the three of you don’t mind, why don’t you come to my place to have some tea?”</p>
<p>“That’d be lovely, I have something to say to you,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Dugu Ge and Xia Xuanyue agreed to go as well. They probably knew why An Tianzuo was inviting them.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was on his way back to school, The Thearch’s ringtone sounded.</p>
<p>“To be able to defeat John, who has the protection of the six-winged seraphim, it seems that I have underestimated you. But why did you reject the six-winged seraphim? Do you know that you have missed a rare opportunity?”</p>
<p>“What’s that six-winged seraphim? He doesn’t appear like a Companion Beast, but he’s different from ordinary dimensional creatures,” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“You’re right. The six-winged seraphim isn’t a Companion Beast or a pure dimensional creature. To put it simply, he’s just a tool,” replied The Thearch.</p>
<p>“A tool? What tool?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Naturally, it’s a tool for combat. It’s also a tool for humans to advance to the Mythical stage. Due to innate limitations, you humans basically don’t have the ability to advance to the Mythical stage. To advance to the Mythical stage, you have to obtain a guardian similar to the six-winged seraphim. By borrowing the guardian’s body, you can advance to the Mythical stage and continue on your path. The six-winged seraphim’s willingness to follow you is equivalent to giving you a chance to advance to the Mythical stage, but you chased him away. Aren’t you regretting it now?” The Thearch gloated.</p>
<p>“You mean borrowing the guardian’s body? Don’t tell me that human bodies won’t improve any further and can only strengthen the guardian’s body in the future?” Zhou Wen acutely sensed something.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I say just now? Due to the innate limitations of the bodies of you humans, it’s nearly impossible for you to advance to the Mythical stage. At most, you can only reach the peak of the Epic stage. The guardian is your way out. Don’t think that it’s that easy for a guardian to betray you. The reason the six-winged seraphim betrayed John was that John wasn’t qualified to form a contract with him. He only used a special method to temporarily form a contract. If it were you, you could truly form a contract with the six-winged seraphim. He wouldn’t betray you so easily. Do you regret rejecting him now?”</p>
<p>“What’s a guardian?” Zhou Wen didn’t regret it. All he wanted to know was what it was.</p>
<p>“They can be considered as the representatives of the various species on your Earth. Every species will have a guardian. They will choose a human to rely on and fight alongside humans to grow, helping you resist the invasion of dimensional creatures,” said The Thearch.</p>
<p>You were the ones who created the dimensional creatures to begin with. Why are you talking about helping us fend off the dimensional creatures’ invasion? Zhou Wen lampooned inwardly, but he didn’t say it out loud.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that the guardian wasn’t as simple as The Thearch had described.</p>
<p>“How many guardians are there on Earth?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought. If he knew how many guardians there were, wouldn’t he know how many dimensional species there were?</p>
<p>“I don’t know that, but you can count. Guardians are born from cocoons. Count the number of cocoons on Earth and that will be the number of guardians,” The Thearch teased Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>That equates to not saying anything. Zhou Wen secretly despised The Thearch. She never answered any important questions.</p>
<p>However, The Thearch’s words reminded Zhou Wen that the cocoon protected by the white dragon in Old Dragon Cave was gone. However, the one in Ant Nest was still around. Perhaps he could target that.</p>
<p>The Ant Nest dungeon on his phone seemed very special. The other cocoons were protected by terrifying Mythical creatures, but there was only a Golden Flying Ant guarding the Ant Nest. The difference was extraordinary.</p>
<p>537 Fighting the Golden Trident Again</p>
<p>“Is there a difference in strength between the guardians?” Zhou Wen felt that the six-winged seraphim was slightly weaker than the one he had seen in the Ant Nest.</p>
<p>“Different species naturally have differences in strength. Why? Are you interested in guardians? As long as you beg me, I can help you contract a powerful guardian,” The Thearch replied.</p>
<p>“I appreciate your kindness.” Zhou Wen thought of John’s fate and didn’t dare get The Thearch to help him.</p>
<p>Is it really impossible for humans to break through to the Mythical stage by themselves? Zhou Wen didn’t believe The Thearch’s words, but he had never heard of anyone advancing to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>After returning to the college, Zhou Wen began grinding Torch Dragon again. A Mythical Transcendent Flying Immortal had greatly increased his speed. Although his Speed stat was only 40, with the augmentation of Transcendent Flying Immortal, his speed was much faster than the dragon wings formed by Sixed-Winged when he used Transcendent Flying Immortal with all his might.</p>
<p>However, that burst of power could only last for a short period of time. It couldn’t last forever under that speed.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because his Essence Energy supply couldn’t keep up, but because his body couldn’t withstand such a huge burden. The burden of a divine skill on his body was too great for any Epic expert.</p>
<p>After grinding Torch Dragon again, Zhou Wen realized that he was much more relaxed. The chances of blocking or dodging the Bright Torch Vision World were even higher. Furthermore, he wasn’t put in such a sorry state as before. He easily lasted for more than three hours, or even more than four hours. If it wasn’t for the fact that he was exhausted, he could have lasted longer.</p>
<p>The problem now was that the toughness of Torch Dragon’s flesh far exceeded Zhou Wen’s imagination. Demonic Neonate’s ancient sword had stabbed it many times, but it had only left a few harmless wounds. They weren’t fatal.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon had a powerful self-healing ability. The wounds on its body healed themselves in battle. Wounds did not have much effect on it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had also attempted to use the Poison Dragon Palm to deal with Torch Dragon, but the results weren’t good. Although he left behind a poison palm print, it vanished shortly after. The poison failed to spread in Torch Dragon’s body.</p>
<p>How can I kill Torch Dragon? Finally, he could block Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World, but he couldn’t kill it. He had to think of another solution.</p>
<p>After some thought, it seemed like no ability was enough to kill Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>There might still be a hope of killing Torch Dragon if Demonic Neonate advances, but she doesn’t eat or drink. How can I help her advance? Zhou Wen had taken quite a lot of things to feed Demonic Neonate during this period of time, but she ate nothing. Zhou Wen was really afraid that she would starve to death.</p>
<p>If I can’t count on Demonic Neonate, I can only wait for the fruit of the Dead Man Tree and Tyrant Behemoth. Zhou Wen looked at Tyrant Behemoth. It was still evolving, and he didn’t know when it would finish. He couldn’t help but worry.</p>
<p>Instead, it was the fruit of the Dead Man Tree that grew bigger by the day, but the fruit’s appearance made Zhou Wen feel that it resembled a black-gray grenade.</p>
<p>It should be coming out soon. I wonder what kind of Companion Beast will appear. If it has Life Blast and curse powers, I might be able to use it against Torch Dragon. Although Zhou Wen thought this, he didn’t place all his hopes on this Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Without heading to the Zhuolu battlefield again, Zhou Wen went to the Metalwork Temple. There was a golden trident there. The golden trident was definitely a Mythical creature. The Companion Egg that dropped was most likely in the form of a weapon.</p>
<p>Although Overlord Sword was very powerful, it was still at the Epic stage after all. It relied on Ever-Victorious to injure Torch Dragon. Otherwise, it couldn’t even tear through Torch Dragon’s hide.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that he had to think of a way to obtain a Mythical weapon. With a Mythical weapon, the possibility of killing Torch Dragon was much higher. Therefore, he placed his sights on the golden trident.</p>
<p>The golden trident had killed the blood-colored avatar once before, but Zhou Wen felt that there was a way to crack it. He had no other options now. As he waited for the Dead Man Tree’s fruit and Behemoth to evolve, he thought of a way to kill the golden trident.</p>
<p>Once again, he arrived at the shrine. The moment the door opened, he saw the golden trident embedded in the furnace. The golden flames burned its body, but it did not cause any reaction.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen took a glance, he saw the golden light shine on the golden trident, as though it wanted to engulf the entire Metalwork Temple.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar was instantly killed the last time. It didn’t even have a chance to dodge.</p>
<p>However, this time, Zhou Wen summoned the strengthened Six-Winged Guardian Dragon and got it to shield him.</p>
<p>The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon directly used Sanctification. Its body turned as white as jade as it unfurled its six dragon wings. Holy flames burned on its body as it spewed out dragon breath to block the golden light in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The terrifying collision shook the entire temple.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw the golden trident fly out of the furnace from behind Six-Winged. It transformed into a golden beam of light that struck at Six-Winged.</p>
<p>Fortunately, its speed was not very fast. However, it had a domineering aura of supremacy. The six dragon wings on the back of the Six-Winged Dragon turned into blades and slashed at the golden trident that was coming at it from above.</p>
<p>Cracking sounds could be heard as the six wings collided with the golden trident. Many of the six dragon wings were broken by it.</p>
<p>What astonishing destructive power! Zhou Wen wasn’t alarmed but delighted. Only with such powerful destructive power could he kill Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>Under Zhou Wen’s command, the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon clashed with the golden trident. However, it didn’t clash head-on with it. Its speed wasn’t as fast as the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. Although its attack was domineering, it couldn’t do a thing to the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon without fighting head-on.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon took the opportunity and struck out with its two front claws, slamming the golden trident down from the sky and pressing it onto the ground.</p>
<p>The golden trident’s body exploded with golden light. It struggled to escape, but it was held down by the Six-Winged. It could not break free no matter what.</p>
<p>Although its destructive power was strong, its strength wasn’t stronger than Six-Winged. Instantly, the two Mythical creatures were in a deadlock. One burst out with golden light and the other spewed holy flames, causing the temple to tremble incessantly.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar watched the battle from outside the temple. Although Six-Winged held a slight advantage, it couldn’t kill the trident. Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and got the blood-colored avatar to charge in with the Overlord Sword. He brandished the Overlord Sword and slashed at the golden trident.</p>
<p>The moment he entered the temple, the divine patterns on the blood-colored avatar’s heavy armor flickered. In a few moments, it collapsed. Thankfully, the blood-colored avatar had already rushed in front of the golden trident. Overlord Sword slashed down with a powerful sword beam.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>There was a deafening sound as a fine crack opened on the golden trident. </p>
<h3 id='chapter538'>Chapter 538 Farming Mythical Creatures</h3>
<p>The golden trident’s body trembled violently as golden light shot forth from its surface.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly used his movement technique to dodge and hide behind Six-Winged so that he was spared from the golden beam’s attack.</p>
<p>The golden light clashed with Six-Winged’s holy flames, slicing apart the holy flames and slicing through its scales, leaving deep wounds that reached to the bone.</p>
<p>As expected of a Mythical creature in the form of a weapon, this destructive power is truly terrifying. Zhou Wen was alarmed. If he was struck by the golden light, even two layers of armor wouldn’t be able to protect him.</p>
<p>It was a pity that no matter how powerful the golden trident’s destructive power was, it was still suppressed by the Six-Winged’s claws. It could not unleash its immense power.</p>
<p>Six-Winged held onto the golden trident tightly. It did not loosen its claws no matter what. Its body was lacerated by the golden light. Fortunately, it was not fatal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly summoned Demonic Neonate and got her to use the ancient sword to attack the golden trident.</p>
<p>Six-Winged was good at almost everything. It could fight, tank, and still survive. The only bad thing about it was that it did not have an offensive Wheel of Destiny. It was also six-winged, but the Six-Winged Seraphim had Holy Angel’s Redemption. That was truly a good weapon.</p>
<p>However, there were pros and cons. The life-saving ability provided by the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon was not something the Six-Winged Seraphim possessed. Otherwise, John wouldn’t have had his throat sliced by him.</p>
<p>Thankfully, apart from the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, Zhou Wen still had Demonic Neonate, a pet with relatively strong offensive powers. Demonic Neonate controlled the ancient sword as she sought out an opportunity, slashing at the golden trident again and again. Furthermore, she targeted a particular spot. She hid behind the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon and was even safer than Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also found all sorts of opportunities to strike at the golden trident. The two pets and the human worked together in a frenzy to slash at the golden trident, leaving it covered in wounds. The deepest impression of the trident was about to be halved.</p>
<p>The golden trident had already gone berserk. Its entire body was shimmering with golden light. In particular, its tip was glowing with a dazzling divine light, as if it could pierce through everything in the world.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it couldn’t move due to Six-Winged’s pressure. The tip couldn’t touch Zhou Wen and company, so it was useless no matter how much strength it unleashed.</p>
<p>After about half an hour, Demonic Neonate’s ancient sword slashed down again. With a clang, the golden trident was cut in half.</p>
<p>‘Killed Mythical creature, Golden Battle God Halberd. Discovered Dimensional Crystal.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but feel somewhat disappointed when he saw that the golden trident didn’t drop a Companion Egg. On careful look, he saw that the dimensional crystal was a Strength +80 crystal. It was high enough, but Zhou Wen’s upper limit was only 40. He couldn’t raise it before breaking through.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen picked up the Strength Crystal and absorbed it. Indeed, his Strength was still at 40. Unless he found a way to raise his Strength to 41 or advance to the Mythical stage, it was impossible for him to raise it any further.</p>
<p>With the experience gained from killing the Golden Battle God Halberd, Zhou Wen kept grinding the Metalwork Temple instance dungeon. He didn’t believe that the Golden Battle God Halberd Companion Egg wouldn’t drop.</p>
<p>After two or three battles, Zhou Wen had roughly figured out the situation with it. Its destructive power was much stronger than the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. Furthermore, the miraculous power of the Wheel of Destiny was also a destructive power. If one was struck by the miraculous power, even the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon would be penetrated. Its Mythical body would be like paper.</p>
<p>However, the Golden Battle God Halberd’s miraculous powers couldn’t hit its target easily. This was because the miraculous powers were actually unable to pierce through the air and injure the opponent. It was only the tip of the trident that carried a tiny blob of resplendent golden divine light. That golden divine light could almost pierce through everything. It was much more powerful than the Overlord Sword’s Ever-Victorious but the attack needed to be close range.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was confident that as long as he had the Golden Battle God Halberd drop, he had more than an eighty percent chance of killing Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>The only regret was that after the Golden Battle God Halberd was killed, even if he respawned the dungeon, he would have to wait 24 hours before a new Golden Battle God Halberd appeared. He couldn’t grind it to his heart’s pleasure. He would still have to wait for some time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t idle. Since he couldn’t grind the Golden Battle God Halberd, he ran to the Curse Demon Palace. There was still Medusa there.</p>
<p>Before it was strengthened, the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon was not Medusa’s match, but it could still fight with her for a while.</p>
<p>Now that Six-Winged had been strengthened, together with Zhou Wen and Demonic Neonate, there was a chance of killing her.</p>
<p>After grinding the rare Epic creatures, Zhou Wen ran to the Curse Demon Palace and charged all the way to Medusa’s hall. He gently touched the beautiful girl and she immediately turned into a terrifying demoness.</p>
<p>The palace was sealed and the blood-colored avatar couldn’t leave. All it could do was fight Medusa in the palace. The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon fought without a fuss as it charged forward with a roar.</p>
<p>With the Sanctification ability, Medusa’s normal Eyes of Petrification was actually much less effective against the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. It could only slightly petrify its surface and cause a minimal effect to the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had the Evil Nullification ability to restrain the Eyes of Petrification, but he could only restrain the ordinary Eyes of Petrification. If he was struck by Medusa’s miraculous Eyes of Petrification, he would still be petrified.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the miraculous Eyes of Petrification shot out substantial light beams from her eyes. As long as he dodged the beam, he wouldn’t be petrified. If it was like the ordinary Eyes of Petrification, he wouldn’t be able to dodge it.</p>
<p>The miraculous Eyes of Petrification was truly invincible. Even the guardian dragon would be petrified upon being hit by the light beam.</p>
<p>What surprised Zhou Wen was Demonic Neonate. This fellow was actually immune to the ordinary Eyes of Petrification despite not having any Evil Nullification abilities.</p>
<p>The human and two pets joined forces to fight Medusa. After spending a great amount of effort, they finally killed Medusa.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>A crisp sound came from the phone, jolting Zhou Wen. He saw that Medusa had dropped an Essence Energy Skill dimensional crystal. Inside the crystal-like dimensional crystal was a demoness-like Medusa shadow.</p>
<p>I actually have Medusa’s skill crystal drop again. Unfortunately, my stats aren’t good enough. I can’t absorb it at all. Zhou Wen was in a dilemma.</p>
<p>The requirement of 41 Constitution and 21 Cursed attributes was too high for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>If he did not absorb it, the skill crystal would be gone after the dungeon respawned. However, if his stats were not enough, he would not be able to absorb it.</p>
<p>In the end, Zhou Wen had no choice but to give up on Medusa’s skill crystal. After all, he could now kill Medusa. There was still a chance for him to grind skill crystals in the future.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen heard from An Sheng that the chance of a Mythical creature dropping Companion Eggs and Skill Crystals was very high. There was about a third chance. After a few days of grinding, it shouldn’t be difficult to obtain the Companion Eggs of Medusa and the Golden Battle God Halberd.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen rested for a while before considering if he should eat something. An Sheng personally came to school and sent over a document that contained John’s testimony.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already guessed most of what had happened. John had obtained the Six-Winged Seraphim from an ancient cathedral in the West District. However, according to him, the ancient cathedral had a terrifying Mythical Creature protecting it. He had avoided the Mythical creature thanks to the advice of a mysterious person, thus obtaining the Six-Winged Seraphim inside the white cocoon. He never expected the Six-Winged Seraphim to betray him.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw a paragraph, his expression turned odd. When An Sheng and company treated John, they realized that John had a body part missing.</p>
<h3 id='chapter539'>Chapter 539 Baby Tiger“s Fusion</h3>
<p>After An Sheng left, Zhou Wen continued grinding. He didn’t know if it was because lady luck had finally smiled at him or because he had spent too much time grinding, but he managed to grind a baby tiger Companion Egg again.</p>
<p>The attributes were about the same, but it didn’t matter. He never expected to have it fight. The key was that the Lucky Baby Tiger’s Life Providence was useful.</p>
<p>However, it was useless bringing two baby tigers with him. Repetition of Life Providences did not stack Luck.</p>
<p>What kind of Companion Beast should I fuse with the tiger? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>This fusion wasn’t easy. If he used the baby tiger as the main pet and used another Companion Beasts to fuse with it, he would still get the baby tiger. The Life Providence obtained from fusion would still be useless.</p>
<p>If he used other Companion Beasts as the main pet and the baby tiger Companion Egg as a supplement, its Life Providence might be the main pet’s Life Providence. Then, there was no point in a fusion.</p>
<p>Therefore, the only way to fuse them was to combine two Companion Beasts without any main or supplement. Then, the Companion Beasts that were combined would randomly combine the various attributes and skills. Even the Life Providences and Life Souls could be changed randomly, just like the Silver-Winged Sky Spider.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the Companion Beasts he currently possessed and then at their compatibility with the baby tiger.</p>
<p>The baby tiger’s compatibility with other Companion Beasts was surprisingly high. It was more than 60%. Very few were below 60.</p>
<p>It can even fuse with Mythical pets? Zhou Wen realized that the baby tiger had a compatibility score of 67% with the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon.</p>
<p>However, after trying out the other mythical pets, they all indicated that they could not be fused.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally didn’t fuse the baby tiger with Six-Winged. After taking a look, Zhou Wen realized that one of the Companion Beasts had a compatibility score of 98% with the baby tiger.</p>
<p>However, when he saw the pet’s stats, a dark cloud hung over Zhou Wen’s head.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast with such a high compatibility rate with the baby tiger was actually Ancient Sovereign City’s Skeleton General.</p>
<p>Strange. One is a skeleton while the other is a beast. Why is the compatibility so high? Zhou Wen looked at the stats of the two Companion Beasts and felt somewhat hesitant.</p>
<p>The Skeleton General was obtained when he went to the Fire God Platform to pluck out the stone saber. He wanted to know if there were any changes in the game’s Ancient Sovereign City. He went in to grind a few times before a Companion Egg dropped. Its stats were rather good, so he hatched it and left it for future pet fusion.</p>
<p>However, no matter how good its stats were, it was ultimately a Legendary Companion Beast. It was useless to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>There was no need to mention the baby tiger. As one of the weakest Epic creatures, any Epic creature could defeat it.</p>
<p>When these two Companion Beasts were fused, they might even form a Legendary Companion Beast. It might not even reach the Epic stage.</p>
<p>However, this was the first time Zhou Wen had encountered such a high compatibility. He carefully observed the stats of the two Companion Beasts and made up his mind to give it a try.</p>
<p>Anyway, what he wanted was the Luck attribute. The level and skills were not that important.</p>
<p>He fused the two hatched Companion Beasts. Amidst a lustrous glow, the fusion succeeded as expected.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at the screen and saw that the Companion Beast he had fused looked like the Skeleton General. However, it wasn’t riding a skeleton horse but a skeleton tiger.</p>
<p>A skeleton general riding on a skeleton tiger holding a bone spear in its hand looked quite powerful.</p>
<p>Tiger Soul General: Epic</p>
<p>Life Providence: Malicious Evil</p>
<p>Life Soul: Tiger Soul</p>
<p>Strength: 29</p>
<p>Speed: 27</p>
<p>Constitution: 27</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 24</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Armor Breaker Spear, Jinxes Master</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>Where’s my Luck Life Providence? What the hell is a Jinxes Master? Questions filled Zhou Wen’s mind.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen regretted it terribly. What the hell were these stats and skills? Not only did none of its stats exceed 30 points as an Epic Companion Beast, but there was even a Jinxes Master skill. Wasn’t this going to jinx him?</p>
<p>The Skeleton General and baby tiger didn’t have such a sinister skill. How did they come up with such a thing?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that he had really screwed up this time. Not only did he fail to have the lucky Life Providence inherit, but he had also obtained a skill that jinxed the master. He definitely couldn’t keep this pet.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had a very deep impression of the Jinxes Husband skill from before. It was a necessary skill to screw one up.</p>
<p>He casually swiped a Companion Beast and placed it with the Tiger Soul General. Zhou Wen didn’t even take notice of what Companion Beast it was. All he saw was that the compatibility was rather low—less than 10%.</p>
<p>He was deliberately trying to make the Tiger Soul General disappear through fusion. He would rather not have it than let it harm him.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen didn’t take a careful look, he roughly knew that the compatibility score was only 7%. He felt that the outcome was doomed to fail, but with a flash of light, a new Companion Beast appeared.</p>
<p>Eh, it succeeded? Zhou Wen was greatly surprised. Although he wasn’t happy, he still looked at the pet’s appearance.</p>
<p>The skeleton tiger and skeleton general were both wearing heavy black armor. However, their faces were exposed. The black armor had dark tiger stripes that looked like lava. It looked domineering.</p>
<p>What I used to fuse with it should be a Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior, right? Zhou Wen vaguely remembered that the one he had casually selected was likely the Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior. He couldn’t help but look at the stats.</p>
<p>Heavy-Armored Tiger Soul General: Epic</p>
<p>Life Providence: Malicious Evil</p>
<p>Life Soul: Tiger Soul Runes</p>
<p>Strength: 34</p>
<p>Speed: 37</p>
<p>Constitution: 38</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 36</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Rampage, Armor Break Spear, Jinxes Master.</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>These stats aren’t bad, but I really can’t keep the Jinxes Master skill. Zhou Wen searched his Companion Beasts again and found one with an even lower compatibility.</p>
<p>The Steel Cauldron Fiend that dropped from the Metalwork Temple was a rare Epic Companion Beast. However, it was too slow and didn’t have any offensive means. It was just a half-fire elemental creature that guarded a steel furnace.</p>
<p>Its compatibility with the Tiger Soul General was only 4%. It was impossible to find Companion Beasts from two different species to have a lower compatibility score.</p>
<p>He placed the Tiger Soul General and the Steel Cauldron Fiend together and pressed the fuse button.</p>
<p>That should be the end of it, right? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>However, with the shimmering light on his phone, Zhou Wen actually heard the notification of a successful fusion. Looking at the new Companion Beast on his phone screen, Zhou Wen’s mouth gaped open for a moment.</p>
<p>He had no idea if it was good or bad luck from succeeding two consecutive fusions with single-digit compatibility.</p>
<p>The newly fused Companion Beast still looked like the Heavy-Armored Tiger Soul General. However, within the heavy-armored tiger and the heavy-armored general’s armor was a bluish-white flame. It looked even more powerful and domineering, like a mighty being that had charged out from hell.</p>
<h3 id='chapter540'>Chapter 540 Jinxes Master</h3>
<p>Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General: Epic</p>
<p>Life Providence: Fierce</p>
<p>Life Soul: Tiger Soul Runes</p>
<p>Strength: 39</p>
<p>Speed: 39</p>
<p>Constitution: 40</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 40</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Tempered Steel Cauldron, Rampage, Armor Breaker Spear, Jinxes Master</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>These stats… It’s almost a top Epic creature… Zhou Wen looked at the stats and his expression changed.</p>
<p>It had to be said that this guy’s attributes were really too good. If he ignored the Jinxes Master skill, its attributes were quite impressive too.</p>
<p>An Epic Armor Breaker Spear was a powerful offensive skill. There was no need to mention Rampage. It was a type of charging Dominance Body.</p>
<p>As for Tempered Steel Cauldron, originally it was not of much use to the Steel Cauldron Fiend as although it was a fire-elemental skill, it could not harm anyone. Instead, it burned flames within the Steel Cauldron Fiend’s body. Under the burning of the flames, its steel armor became harder and harder. It was a skill used to tank.</p>
<p>However, this skill was somewhat different on the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. While he was charging, he could use Tempered Steel Cauldron. It would make the fiend armor on the Tiger Soul General become harder. With Rampage’s effects as a Dominance Body and the Armor Breaker Spear ability, as well as the Tiger Soul Runes to augment him, there were probably not many opponents at the same level who could block the Runic-Armored Tiger Soul General’s charge.</p>
<p>However, the Jinxes Master Skill was a sore sight. Zhou Wen took the Runic-Armored Tiger Soul General to the Metalwork Temple, hoping to see how powerful his combat abilities were.</p>
<p>Seeing the few Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior loitering in the distance, Zhou Wen ordered the Runic-Armored Tiger Soul General to charge over.</p>
<p>With a command, it roared as the bluish-white flames on its body burned. The lava patterns on the black heavy armor also turned into a strange orange-white color. Like a devil, he charged at the Runic Heavy-Armored Warriors.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>With the augmentation of the powerful Essence Energy Skill, the Runic-Armored Tiger Soul General sent the few Runic Heavy-Armored Warriors flying. The spear struck a Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior and penetrated his chest with the bone spear. He slammed into a metal wall and was lifted up by the Tiger Soul General before shattering into pieces in midair.</p>
<p>Then, Zhou Wen saw a shocking scene. They were both at the Epic stage, and they were mainly defense-type beasts. However, the Runic-Armored Tiger Soul General charged forward as though it had entered an invincible state. It killed the Runic Heavy-Armored Warriors one by one. It was like a mighty being that had descended into the mortal world.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s Essence Energy seemed to be endless. The fire within the Tempered Steel Cauldron kept burning. It made the heavy armor on the Demonized General and Demonized Tiger stronger and stronger. Even the Tiger Soul Runes on them glowed brighter and brighter, becoming stronger as the battle progressed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen made him charge the entire way as the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General swept through the area. He wasn’t afraid of being ganked by many Epic creatures. Instead, he became more and more ferocious as he charged back and trampled on the dimensional creatures. It was as though he had entered an invincible state.</p>
<p>Even though all of them were at the Epic stage, a single charge was enough to smash through the Runic Heavy-Armored Warriors’ armor, killing them on the spot.</p>
<p>A Fire Furnace Queen appeared and threw out the fire from a furnace, turning the hall into a sea of flames.</p>
<p>However, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General showed no fear. He rode on the tiger and charged into the sea of flames. The demonic runes and flames flickered on its body as he stabbed the Fire Furnace Queen to death with one strike.</p>
<p>Ferocious… Too ferocious… Zhou Wen was dumbfounded. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that this fellow was the strongest Epic pet. Zhou Wen had never seen such a ferocious Epic creature before.</p>
<p>Even the Mutated Demonized General that combined three skills was much weaker than the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>However, as the dimensional creatures were killed, the flames on the Tempered Steel Cauldron gradually dimmed. His aura and strength seemed to weaken as he slowly returned to a normal standard.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found it strange. After trying a few times, he realized that this fellow was a war machine. He needed to constantly fight and kill in order to have unlimited Essence Energy. The more he killed, the stronger his various abilities became, especially with the augmentation of the Tempered Steel Cauldron.</p>
<p>Due to its limited Essence Energy, the Steel Cauldron Fiend could only last for a short period of time when using Tempered Steel Cauldron. However, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General could use it perpetually, making his heavy armor harder and harder. The Tiger Soul Runes on the heavy armor also became stronger.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen studied it for a while and roughly understood that the combination of his Life Providence, Life Soul, and skills was perfect. It allowed him to become stronger the more he killed. Each one of the three was necessary.</p>
<p>This is indeed a good pet, but why hasn’t the Jinxes Master been removed after so many fusions? Zhou Wen was somewhat conflicted.</p>
<p>The pet was good, but Zhou Wen was still afraid about Jinxes Master rearing its head.</p>
<p>The Ghost King’s lesson remained fresh in his mind. He did not want to be screwed by the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General at a critical moment. By then, it would be too late to cry.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen couldn’t bear to destroy such a powerful Companion Beast.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen decided to fuse it again. However, this time, he didn’t deliberately choose low-success Companion Beasts. Instead, he chose a Companion Egg with a high success rate and wanted to see if he could eliminate the Jinxes Master skill.</p>
<p>If it could be eliminated, he would never find Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General redundant.</p>
<p>However, if he couldn’t eliminate it, Zhou Wen would rather destroy him than keep him by his side.</p>
<p>What kind of pet should I use to fuse with it? Zhou Wen wasn’t so rash this time as he carefully chose.</p>
<p>There were a total of six Epic Companion Eggs with a compatibility score above 60 with the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. Throwing aside those with inferior skills and Life Providences, Zhou Wen was left with three rather satisfactory ones.</p>
<p>After some consideration, Zhou Wen finally chose a Companion Egg that dropped from Curse Demon Palace.</p>
<p>Epic Petrification Beasts had attributes that were more inclined towards their Constitution and Strength. Their Speed was relatively poor, and their Life Providences and Life Souls were relatively ordinary. The only benefit was that they possessed an Essence Energy Skill that was very compatible with the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>This Essence Energy Skill known as the Magic Stone Curse wasn’t considered powerful on the Petrification Beast. The Magic Stone Curse wasn’t a curse on the enemy, but on oneself.</p>
<p>After using the Magic Stone Curse, one’s skin and bones would become as hard as a rock, which would strengthen one’s defense.</p>
<p>Besides that, the Magic Stone Curse had another effect. Once it was used, other people would be affected by the Magic Stone Curse attacking the Petrification Beast’s body. Their bodies would also show signs of petrification.</p>
<p>However, unlike the petrification of the Petrification Beast, the bodies of others would become stiff and their movements would also become slower. It was even possible that they would become stone statues just like Medusa’s Eyes of Petrification.</p>
<p>Of course, the effect of the Magic Stone Curse was far inferior to the Eyes of Petrification. One would suffer complete petrification only if one was injured by the Magic Stone Curse numerous times. Furthermore, the petrification effect was not permanent. There was a time limit.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen believed that if the Magic Stone Curse could replace the Jinxes Master skill, the four-skilled Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General would be invincible. Not only would he become stronger as he fought, but he could even reflect attacks and produce curse effects.</p>
<h3 id='chapter541'>Chapter 541 Infinite Jinxes Master</h3>
<p>The fusion this time had a Petrification Lion Companion Egg as the supplement. This ensured that the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s Life Providence and Life Soul could be retained. It only replaced skills.</p>
<p>However, it was also risky for such a fusion. It was possible that the skills that he needed would end up replaced, leaving behind skills he didn’t need.</p>
<p>In order to minimize the risk, Zhou Wen especially went to Curse Demon Palace to grind for Petrification Lion Companion Eggs. He obtained one before he fused it with the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. He tried his best to reduce the negative consequences of having many skills.</p>
<p>Feeling a little nervous, Zhou Wen added the Petrification Lion Companion Egg. Luckily, the chances of Magic Stone Curse replacing Jinxes Master was relatively low.</p>
<p>The game lit up as the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General successfully fused. Zhou Wen hurriedly checked his stats.</p>
<p>The Life Providence and Life Soul remained unchanged. His Strength attribute had also increased to 40 points. Only his Speed attribute was still at 39. Other than the Mythical Pets, there were very few pets that could match up to such stats.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s gaze quickly shifted down as he saw the skill column.</p>
<p>Tempered Steel Cauldron, Rampage, Armor Breaker Spear, Magic Stone Curse… Zhou Wen’s heart was lifted, but when he saw the words “Jinxes Master,” his heart immediately plummeted.</p>
<p>I’ve already fused so many times. Why is the Jinxes Master skill still here? Zhou Wen felt like crying. Four skills were already the limit of a typical Companion Beast. Although there was a chance of a fusion pet exceeding four skills, the chances weren’t high. Now, the low-probability event of five skills had happened, but Jinxes Master remained.</p>
<p>I need to fuse it again… I have to fuse it again… Although the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General could be considered a perfect Epic pet, Zhou Wen definitely couldn’t keep it thanks to its Jinxes Master skill.</p>
<p>What else can I fuse it with? Zhou Wen was in a dilemma.</p>
<p>Since it had the Magic Stone Curse skill, using Petrification Lion for the fusion would likely result in Magic Stone Curse replacing Magic Stone Curse. It would be difficult to remove the Jinxes Master skill.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to choose from one of the remaining Companion Beasts with higher fusion compatibility. He didn’t care if the skills were suitable or not. He decided to fuse them first. If he could eliminate Jinxes Master, he could slowly fuse the skills again.</p>
<p>This time, he used a Petrification Knight which had multiple skills for fusion. Legend had it that the warrior who defeated Medusa was eventually transformed into a puppet by Medusa after being petrified.</p>
<p>Steeling his mind, Zhou Wen took out the Companion Egg of the four-skilled pet, Petrification Knight. With the four skills of the Petrification Knight and the five skills of the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, there were a total of nine skills. The chance of eliminating a few skills was definite. He hoped to eliminate Jinxes Master.</p>
<p>He placed the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General with the Petrification Knight Companion Egg and pressed the fusion button.</p>
<p>The pet and egg shone brightly as they combined together.</p>
<p>With a crisp sound, the light dissipated and the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General appeared again. The fusion had succeeded again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s stats and realized that all four stats had reached the maximum of 40 points. It didn’t have the foundation of a Mythical creature, so it couldn’t increase to 41.</p>
<p>The Life Providence and Life Soul did not change. They were still Malicious Evil and Tiger Soul Runes.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the skill column, Zhou Wen looked over one skill after another, feeling a little nervous.</p>
<p>Tempered Steel Cauldron, Rampage, Armor Breaker Spear, Magic Stone Curse, Man-Mount As One… Jinxes Master… Zhou Wen was dumbfounded. Another skill had been added to it, but Jinxes Master remained.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General with mixed feelings. For a moment, he didn’t know how to react.</p>
<p>This fellow’s stats and skills were already cream of the crop. Apart from Mythical pets, it would be very difficult to find a pet that was better than it.</p>
<p>But this Jinxes Master… Zhou Wen didn’t have the confidence.</p>
<p>Perhaps a result of having fused too many times, Zhou Wen realized that the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s compatibility score with other Companion Beasts was much lower when he checked it. It went from 60-70 compatibility to about 30-40. Most of them were below 10.</p>
<p>With such compatibility continuing, the chance of failing will be too high if I continue fusing. Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and found the one with the highest compatibility. He would rather have it gone than keep Jinxes Master.</p>
<p>Although it was already the highest compatibility score, it was only 42. The success rate was about 40%.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to press the fusion button, he suddenly heard his phone ring.</p>
<p>He picked up his phone and took a look. Seeing that it was An Sheng, he picked up the call with one hand and was about to press the fusion button with the other.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, there’s news from Zhuolu. The experts have confirmed Qiongqi’s identity and have come up with some solutions…” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen heard Qiongqi’s name, he suddenly had a flash of inspiration. He stopped his finger midway without pressing the button.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen remembered hearing The Thearch say that if he wanted to defeat Qiongqi, it was best to let an evil person go. If a good person were to go, the chances of killing Qiongqi would be very low.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen didn’t know why such a strange thing would happen, the current Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General had a Malicious Evil Life Providence. Was he considered an evil person?</p>
<p>With this thought in mind, he could not bring himself to press down with his finger.</p>
<p>An Sheng informed Zhou Wen about the results of the experts’ research. After hearing it, Zhou Wen felt that their research was rather reasonable. They had determined some of Qiongqi’s skills.</p>
<p>However, this did not have a decisive effect on killing Qiongqi. What was truly scary about Qiongqi was not just those few skills.</p>
<p>The experts also mentioned Qiongqi’s penchant for bullying good, kind people. However, they believed that it was a character of the legendary Qiongqi. No one expected that this character could be exploited.</p>
<p>After An Sheng hung up, Zhou Wen looked at the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General with a thoughtful expression. In the end, he decided to not continue the fusion. He decided to take him to fight Qiongqi to see if it would be of any use.</p>
<p>After entering the Zhuolu ruins, Zhou Wen didn’t go to Torch Dragon. After killing the Aoyin stone statue, he went to Qiongqi.</p>
<p>The moment the temple’s door opened, Zhou Wen summoned his Companion Beasts. The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon took the front, with the other Companion Beasts followed behind. One of them was the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon lunged straight at Qiongqi. Qiongqi also rushed forward like before, but something unexpected happened.</p>
<p>It was as if Qiongqi had not had its fill today. Be it in terms of strength, speed, or various skills, it seemed to have weakened significantly.</p>
<p>The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, which had been suppressed by Qiongqi, was actually able to fight Qiongqi to a standstill.</p>
<p>Does the Malicious Evil Life Providence really work? Zhou Wen was dumbfounded.</p>
<h3 id='chapter542'>Chapter 542 The Effect of the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General</h3>
<p>It was unknown if it was intentional or not, but Qiongqi never took the initiative to attack the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. The other Epic Companion Beasts were killed by Qiongqi in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Although Qiongqi eventually killed the blood-colored avatar, Zhou Wen saw some hope of killing it.</p>
<p>I wonder if there are any other Companion Beasts with similar Life Providences? After Zhou Wen exited the game, he checked online and found a few.</p>
<p>However, those Companion Beasts were too rare. Furthermore, they weren’t any better than the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. The most famous one was Tai Sui. That fellow had a Great Portent Life Providence and had the attribute of misfortune. He was even more terrifying than the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General is still considered gentle. At the very least, Jinxes Master doesn’t appear too obvious. I haven’t seen him jinxing yet. Wasn’t there an emperor in ancient times who had a horse that jinxed its master. Whoever rode it died. However, the emperor managed to escape a calamity by riding this horse… Zhou Wen was purely comforting himself.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t discovered that the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was actually effective against Qiongqi, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have second thoughts about fusing it away. No matter how strong he was, he couldn’t be stronger than a Mythical pet. Keeping him alive was a scourge.</p>
<p>But now, Zhou Wen had the possibility of killing Qiongqi thanks to it. He had no choice but to consider leaving the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General behind.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was wondering about the possibility of the former principal and company not entering Torch Dragon’s temple, but Qiongqi’s temple. If that were the case, it would be useless even if he killed Torch Dragon. He would have to kill Qiongqi again. When that happened, he would need the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, a Companion Beast will only show its effects when summoned. At most, I won’t summon him. That would prevent any obstacles, right? Zhou Wen felt uneasy. He wasn’t confident, but that was the only way.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it’s just a Tiger Soul General. If there’s another Tai Sui, I’ll be dead. Zhou Wen closed the webpage introducing Tai Sui.</p>
<p>When the Golden Battle God Halberd respawned, Zhou Wen eagerly rushed in-game. After an intense battle with the Golden Battle God Halberd, he finally snapped it with Demonic Neonate’s ancient sword.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>A crystal dropped. Zhou Wen saw that it was an Essence Energy Skill Crystal. Inside the amber-like crystal was a golden trident’s shadow.</p>
<p>He picked it up and took a closer look and the game immediately gave him a notification: ‘Insufficient stats… Unmatched Life Providence… Rejected Life Soul…’</p>
<p>The series of notifications left Zhou Wen’s head spinning.</p>
<p>Using his phone to check the Essence Energy Skill Crystal’s information, he discovered that the Golden Battle God Halberd’s Essence Energy Skill Crystal required 41 points of Strength. This requirement was considered the simplest of all the Mythical Essence Energy Skills that Zhou Wen knew. There was no special stat requirement.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen still couldn’t meet the 41 Strength requirement.</p>
<p>Regarding the requirements of having a Constitution-type Life Providence and Life Soul, Zhou Wen attempted by switching to the Small Perfection of Wisdom. The Eight Perfections Wisdom Life Providence was compatible, but his lack of a Life Soul made it a mismatch.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, if I can condense the Small Perfection of Wisdom’s Life Soul and raise my Strength to 41 points, wouldn’t I be able to learn the Golden Battle God Halberd skill? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that there was some hope.</p>
<p>Among all the Mythical Skills that Zhou Wen had seen, this was most likely to be one he could learn.</p>
<p>How can I have my Strength break through to 41 points? Zhou Wen had always been puzzled about the method to increase his stats.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen had an idea. His Life Soul was formed after absorbing the attributes. Therefore, Zhou Wen was wondering if his Life Soul could affect his stats if it advanced to Perfection.</p>
<p>The postfix of Strength was Sun. Later on, it was absorbed by the Inverse Ancient Sovereign Life Soul. If it advanced to Perfection, he wondered if it could influence the Strength attribute and increase his Strength to 41 points.</p>
<p>Of course, this was only Zhou Wen’s speculation. However, he could give it a try. The Inverse Ancient Sovereign was already an Evolved Body. Any further and it would be able to advance to a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was facing a choice. If he decided to gain new insights into his Life Soul and wait to absorb the Golden Battle God Halberd Crystal, he couldn’t respawn the dungeons. Otherwise, he would lose the skill crystal.</p>
<p>If he wanted to continue grinding Mythical Companion Eggs, he had to give up on the skill crystal.</p>
<p>The drop rate of Mythical creatures is still rather high. I should continue grinding Companion Eggs. Zhou Wen thought for a moment before deciding to grind Companion Eggs first. After all, only with the Golden Battle God Halberd could he kill Torch Dragon. This was of paramount importance.</p>
<p>After putting down the Golden Battle God Halberd Crystal, Zhou Wen went to the Curse Demon Palace again. After killing Medusa with great difficulty, he had two crystals drop. One was a Speed Crystal, while the other was a Constitution Crystal. All of them exceeded 70 points, but they were useless to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>After grinding all the rare dimensional creatures, he reserved the Companion Eggs that dropped for pet fusion. Then, he had nothing else to do. He had to wait until tomorrow for the Golden Battle God Halberd and Medusa to respawn.</p>
<p>Since he had nothing to do during this period of time, Zhou Wen took the book he borrowed from the library and continued studying it.</p>
<p>Since Small Perfection of Wisdom hadn’t condensed a Life Soul, Zhou Wen wanted to take this opportunity to study it and condense it so that he could absorb the Golden Battle God Halberd skill crystal.</p>
<p>With the Golden Battle God Halberd and the Golden Battle God technique, he was certain he could kill Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>Wisdom had different types—two, three, and six types.</p>
<p>Shared or Unshared Wisdom, True Insight Wisdom, and Wisdom of Meditative Enlightenment, Mundane Wisdom, and Supramundane wisdom—all of these were Two Wisdoms.</p>
<p>True Insight Wisdom, Wisdom of Meditative Enlightenment, along with Written Wisdom were the Three Wisdoms.</p>
<p>The six Wisdoms were True Insight Wisdom, External World Wisdom, Written Wisdom, Wisdom of Skillful Means, Attendant Wisdom, and Wisdom of Meditative Enlightenment. These combined were also the Diamond Wisdom.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s Life Providence was Eight Perfections Wisdom. There were two more types of Wisdom. Zhou Wen did plenty of research, but he couldn’t figure out what the Eight Perfections of Wisdom meant. Therefore, he hadn’t figured out the profundity of the Small Perfection of Wisdom to condense a Life Soul.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen vaguely felt that this Small Perfection of Wisdom was somewhat different from the real Perfection of Wisdom. The three-faced Buddha in Small Buddha Temple was somewhat different from the Buddhas in ordinary monasteries.</p>
<p>Just as he was thinking, his phone rang again. This time, it was from Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, I’m hungry,” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it noon now?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“You owe me so many breakfasts. Didn’t you say you were going to make up with it using lunch? Are you trying to go back on your word? Quickly get me some food to eat. I’m starving,” said Wang Lu.</p>
<h3 id='chapter543'>Chapter 543 Gold Burial Ground</h3>
<p>“Since you’ve already come out, why don’t you buy the food yourself?” Zhou Wen handed over the food he had bought from the cafeteria to Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“That’s how I roll, isn’t I?” Wang Lu took the food and sat in a flower bed to eat.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sat down by the side and began munching on his roujiamo—meat sandwiched in bread.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, what plans do you have after graduation? With your relationship with the An family, you should be able to directly enter the Sunset army, right?” Wang Lu asked Zhou Wen as she ate her bread.</p>
<p>“No, I plan on returning to my hometown.” Zhou Wen had never planned on entering the Sunset army.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen really planned on returning to his hometown after graduation. He had seen quite a number of dungeons. He had even cleared two of the West District’s dungeons.</p>
<p>However, dimensional zones like the Ancient Sovereign City were very rare. The strongest creature in the Ancient Sovereign City was only at the Legendary stage. It looked like a very weak dimensional zone.</p>
<p>However, things like stone sabers that could be seen in-game, but untouchable and very rare in dimensional zones. Chess Mountain also had a similar jade box, but everyone knew how terrifying Chess Mountain was.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that Ancient Sovereign City wasn’t that simple. Therefore, he wanted to return to Guide City after graduation.</p>
<p>“Your hometown is Guide City, right? There aren’t any overly famous dimensional zones there, so there aren’t many opportunities for development.” Wang Lu paused for a moment before she said jokingly, “Why don’t you consider going to the capital after graduation? That way, you can also repay your debts.”</p>
<p>Wang Lu came from the capital’s Wang family which was not the same Wang family in Luoyang.</p>
<p>“It’s still early. Let’s talk about it when the time comes.” Zhou Wen felt that graduation was still a long way off. Perhaps, the restrictions of the dimensional zone would fail before he graduated. He wouldn’t be at liberty to decide when that happened. All he could do was take things one step at a time.</p>
<p>“Then if you have nowhere to go in the future, remember to look for me in the capital. Our Wang family welcomes talented people very much. Besides, as an old schoolmate of mine, I can still take care of you,” Wang Lu said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>Not far away, a few students were resting on the grass.</p>
<p>“Did you hear that someone found a Gold Burial Ground in the Dungeon?”</p>
<p>“What’s Gold Burial Ground?”</p>
<p>“You don’t even know what Gold Burial Ground is? It’s those you hear of in legends where a piece of gold is buried. After some time, this kind of Gold Burial Ground turns one piece of gold into two pieces of gold.”</p>
<p>“It must be fake. Only ignoramuses would believe such a ridiculous thing.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you doubt me. I don’t know if Gold Burial Grounds existed in the past, but after the dimensional storms, someone really discovered one. Furthermore, it’s been validated. The Gold Burial Ground does have magical powers. This person is famous in the Federation.”</p>
<p>“Who is it?”</p>
<p>“It’s the Xia family’s hero.”</p>
<p>“Are you serious? Why haven’t I heard of it before? Are you making it up?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean I made it up? There really was such a thing. There was more than one hero present at that time. However, that place was discovered by the Xia family’s hero. Besides, only he believed in the legend of Gold Burial Grounds. Hence, he was the only one who managed to find it.”</p>
<p>“What did he bury?”</p>
<p>“He buried a sword and dug out two swords. Can you guess which two swords they are? You must have heard of the names of those two swords.”</p>
<p>“No way? Could it be the famous Twin Dragon Swords of the Xia family?”</p>
<p>“Not bad. What the Xia family hero buried in the Gold Burial Ground back then was a Dragon Blood Sword Companion Egg. When he dug it out the next day, there were two Dragon Blood Sword Companion Eggs…”</p>
<p>The students were having a good time chatting, pumped as though all of that had happened.</p>
<p>“Senior, you were talking about the Gold Burial Ground being found in the Dungeon? Where is it?” Wang Lu eavesdropped for a while before running over to ask for information.</p>
<p>“If someone asks, I definitely won’t tell them. However, you’re so pretty there’s no harm telling you. That place is in the underground Ancient City that we often go to. However, it’s useless for you to go there now. I heard that the Gold Burial Ground only allows one thing to be buried once. It’s useless if you bury more. According to the senior who discovered the Gold Burial Ground, he accidentally dropped a dimensional crystal when he killed a dimensional creature. When he dug up again, he found two identical dimensional crystals…” The senior was very talkative and explained everything clearly.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Senior.” Wang Lu thanked him.</p>
<p>“Junior, don’t be in such a hurry to leave. Do you want me to take you there?” the senior said warmly when he saw Wang Lu’s beauty.</p>
<p>“There’s no need, Senior. Thank you.” As Wang Lu spoke, she had already returned to the flower bed.</p>
<p>“You don’t have anything else to do this afternoon, right? Let’s go and take a look together. Perhaps there’s really a Gold Burial Ground,” Wang Lu said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Didn’t they say that the Gold Burial Ground can only be used once? Then what’s the use of going there?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“To take a look. It’s just a legend that Gold Burial Ground only allows one burial. Perhaps it can be used again?” Wang Lu pulled Zhou Wen towards the underground Ancient City.</p>
<p>The underground ancient city mentioned by the students was actually the Ancient City dimensional zone which was in the uppermost layer. Although there were many dimensional creatures there, most of them were at the Mortal stage. The strongest was at the Legendary stage. Therefore, ordinary students would usually go there to learn how to hunt dimensional creatures. This meant it was very popular.</p>
<p>However, the dimensional creatures there didn’t produce anything particularly good. Therefore, students with some strength wouldn’t choose to stay there for long.</p>
<p>When Wang Lu and Zhou Wen arrived at the underground Ancient City, they realized that there were many students here. They were all searching for something in the dilapidated Ancient City. They must have heard the legend of the Gold Burial Ground, so they had come here to try their luck.</p>
<p>“There are so many people searching for the Gold Burial Ground. Even if there really is one, it’s already been occupied by countless people. Let’s head back.” Zhou Wen was still thinking about how he could condense his Life Soul with the Small Perfection of Wisdom, so he really didn’t wish to waste time on such an iffy matter.</p>
<p>“That’s not necessarily the case. How do you know there’s no chance if you don’t give it a try?” Wang Lu sized up Zhou Wen and said after looking at his feet, “Give me your shoes.”</p>
<p>“What for?” Zhou Wen looked at her in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Take off your right shoe and give it to me. You will know in a while,” urged Wang Lu.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took off his right shoe and gave it to her. Wang Lu picked it up and made a prayer-like action before throwing it into the sky.</p>
<p>After the shoe landed, Wang Lu pointed in the direction of the shoe and said, “Let’s look over there.”</p>
<p>“Will this really work?” Zhou Wen put on his shoes and followed Wang Lu forward.</p>
<p>“Let’s give it a try. Perhaps it will work.” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>The two of them walked all the way into Ancient City. It was really in ruins. Many of the walls were made of clay bricks. After the passage of time, they were pockmarked and covered in dust. No matter how one looked at it, it did not look like an ancient city but more like a village.</p>
<p>As they walked, one of Wang Lu’s ear studs dropped. After falling to the ground, it bounced into a fist-sized hole.</p>
<h3 id='chapter544'>Chapter 544 Hole</h3>
<p>“Let me do it.” Zhou Wen squatted down and reached his hand into the hole.</p>
<p>The hole was along a mud wall. It was probably dug out by something like a rat. As there weren’t any powerful dimensional creatures here, Zhou Wen didn’t activate Truth Listener. The hole wasn’t deep either. Zhou Wen extended his hand and touched it. Soon, he touched something. When he touched it, he realized that it was indeed Wang Lu’s ear stud.</p>
<p>However, what was strange was that Wang Lu had dropped one ear stud, but Zhou Wen touched two identical ear studs.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He looked at Wang Lu’s other ear stud and couldn’t help but ask, “How many ear studs did you drop?”</p>
<p>“One,” Wang Lu replied.</p>
<p>“Why are there two ear studs here? Could it be…” Zhou Wen looked at the hole. He couldn’t believe that it was the legendary Gold Burial Ground.</p>
<p>Wang Lu took the two ear studs and carefully looked at them. Soon, she said with certainty, “These two ear studs are identical. Even the spots I accidentally scratched are identical. From the looks of it, we have really found the legendary Gold Burial Ground. Quick, take something and give it a try.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat hesitant. Wang Lu’s luck was good enough to discover the Gold Burial Ground, but his luck wasn’t that good. Furthermore, he felt that the Gold Burial Ground was somewhat odd.</p>
<p>“It isn’t easy to find a Gold Burial Ground. Don’t you want to give it a try?” Wang Lu asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could answer, he saw a figure rush over. He was originally searching for the Gold Burial Ground nearby. Upon hearing Zhou Wen and Wang Lu’s conversation, he rushed over. Without waiting for Zhou Wen and Wang Lu to react, he stuffed a Companion Egg into the hole.</p>
<p>“Hey, aren’t you being a little impolite?” Zhou Wen said with a frown.</p>
<p>“You have to share the good stuff with everyone. We’re all schoolmates after all. Why be so petty? At most, you can use it later.” The person raised his head as he spoke.</p>
<p>“It’s you?” Zhou Wen exchanged looks with the person and immediately recognized him.</p>
<p>This person’s name was Li Yu. Previously, Zhou Wen had set up a stall to sell Companion Eggs at the school’s trading market. Back then, there were two students who had set up stalls beside him. One was Huang Ji and the other was Li Yu.</p>
<p>Back then, Zhou Wen had a tiny conflict with Li Yu because of Gu Dian. Li Yu had suffered a little, but he never expected to meet him again today.</p>
<p>“So it’s you, Zhou Wen. You caused me so much pain last time. Let me use the Gold Burial Ground this time and we’re even.” Li Yu grinned and asked, “How long will it take for this Gold Burial Ground to take effect?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered to argue with him, so he replied, “The ear stud fell moments ago. There were two once I tried taking it out.”</p>
<p>“Legend has it that we have to bury it for one night. I was just wondering how long it would take for us to pass the time. It turns out that it can be done so soon,” Li Yu said as he reached his hand into the hole.</p>
<p>After touching it a few times, Li Yu’s expression changed. His squatting body suddenly turned into a kneeling position. His face was almost pressed to the side of the hole. Most of his arm was stretched in as he groped about.</p>
<p>“Where… where’s my Companion Egg?” Li Yu’s expression was not not a happy one. He searched the hole several times but failed to find anything.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing?” Zhou Wen activated Truth Listener and listened to the hole.</p>
<p>The hole wasn’t too deep to begin with, so he could hear everything clearly.</p>
<p>It was a small hole about forty centimeters deep. There were no forks or Companion Eggs inside.</p>
<p>“Impossible? I just put it in there. It can’t be wrong. Why is it gone?” Li Yu reached in again and groped about anxiously. However, there was nothing inside. He could not touch it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also found it odd. He had seen Li Yu put the Companion Egg in with his own eyes. Why was it gone?</p>
<p>“Are you deliberately messing with me? That Companion Egg was from the company and not mine. Stop fooling around and return it to me. I know I was wrong. I’ll compensate you, alright?” Li Yu was anxious. Unable to find it, he stood up to bow to Zhou Wen and Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“Don’t spout nonsense. We didn’t take your Companion Egg. You were the one who insisted on putting it in. Who can you blame?” Wang Lu curled her lips and said.</p>
<p>Li Yu was speechless. He also knew that Zhou Wen and Wang Lu’s statuses weren’t ordinary, so he didn’t dare cause trouble with them.</p>
<p>“Wang Lu, give me an ear stud.” Zhou Wen extended his hand in front of Wang Lu.</p>
<p>Wang Lu handed him an ear stud. Zhou Wen threw the ear stud into the hole and used Truth Listener to listen. However, there was no reaction. It was just an ordinary hole.</p>
<p>He reached in and touched. There was only one ear stud.</p>
<p>“It’s indeed a little strange,” Zhou Wen said with a frown as he looked at the ear stud in his hand.</p>
<p>“This hole clearly replicated my ear studs just now. Why did it suddenly fail? It’s very strange,” Wang Lu added.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head slightly. “That’s not what I’m talking about. The reason this news spread is because someone discovered the Gold Burial Ground. In other words, that person used the Gold Burial Ground and knew its effects before he could spread the news. However, if it’s really effective, he should be constantly burying things inside. How can he spread such important news?”</p>
<p>“What you said makes sense. Since he spread the news, it must be that Gold Burial Ground is already useless. Or rather, there’s something wrong with that Gold Burial Ground…” Li Yu also came to a realization. He pounded his chest and stamped his feet, regretting that he hadn’t thought of this in advance. He even took the company’s Epic Companion Egg and stuffed it in. He was truly blinded by wealth.</p>
<p>“My ear studs were clearly replicated, and his Companion Eggs disappeared. Doesn’t that mean that the Gold Burial Ground exists? Furthermore, it’s indeed effective. However, there’s a problem with it?” Wang Lu said as she looked at the hole.</p>
<p>“Is there any way to retrieve my Companion Egg?” Li Yu asked Wang Lu as though he was grasping at straws.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Try again.” Wang Lu shook her head.</p>
<p>Li Yu could not be bothered anymore. He knelt beside the cave and placed some of his trinkets inside. After a while, he took them out. However, it was useless. They were not replicated, neither had they disappeared.</p>
<p>This was within Zhou Wen’s expectations. It was an ordinary hole. He had been listening for a long time. There was nothing around the hole, nor were there any energy fluctuations.</p>
<p>“Wang Lu, can you search again?” Zhou Wen asked Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“Yes, but this will be the last time for today. Give me your shoe,” said Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“Can’t you use something else?” Zhou Wen had to take off his shoe and give it to Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“No.” Wang Lu took the shoe and threw it into the air.</p>
<p>The shoe landed, but this time, it pointed in a different direction, not in the direction of the hole.</p>
<h3 id='chapter545'>Chapter 545 The Secret of the Hole</h3>
<p>This time, when the two of them walked forward, Zhou Wen raised Truth Listener’s powers to the limit as he constantly scanned his surroundings.</p>
<p>After walking for a while, Zhou Wen discovered a strange spot. Beneath a mud wall was a place where Truth Listener couldn’t hear. It was as though something had isolated it, preventing him from hearing anything.</p>
<p>The direction the duo were heading in happened to line up with this area.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen looked, he saw that there was a hole beneath the mud wall. It was similar to the hole just now, but this hole was clearly different. Even Truth Listener couldn’t tell what was going on inside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gave Wang Lu a look before looking in the direction of the hole. Wang Lu looked at the hole, but she couldn’t tell what was wrong with it. She only felt that the hole looked very similar to the one from before.</p>
<p>“Could this hole be the legendary Gold Burial Ground? Why don’t we try using something first?” Zhou Wen deliberately said loudly to Wang Lu.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that there was something wrong with the Gold Burial Ground. Not only was it able to move, but it had also swallowed Li Yu’s Companion Egg. The thing it had replicated was an ear stud with very low practical value. No matter how he thought about it, there was something amiss.</p>
<p>“What if the thing that’s placed inside ends up disappearing like that person’s Companion Egg?” Wang Lu said cooperatively.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. Let’s give it a try first. I remember you have a Mythical Companion Egg on you, right? Try using an unimportant Companion Egg or something first. If there’s no problem, put the Mythical Companion Egg inside,” Zhou Wen said to Wang Lu while winking.</p>
<p>“Is that so? Alright then.” Wang Lu touched her pocket knowingly. She took out something and placed it in the hole.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept observing the hole. After Wang Lu placed the item inside, a strange energy fluctuation immediately appeared in the hole. Unfortunately, Zhou Wen could only sense the energy fluctuation and couldn’t hear what was happening inside.</p>
<p>However, as long as he could sense something unusual in the hole, he could lock onto it. He wasn’t afraid that it would escape. Zhou Wen refused to believe that it was faster than his saber.</p>
<p>After a while, the energy fluctuations in the cave gradually came to a stop. As for the hole, there was still a force that screened his powers. Zhou Wen still couldn’t hear what was happening inside.</p>
<p>He gave Wang Lu a look before she squatted down. As she reached out to reach into the hole, she said, “I wonder if this is the Gold Burial Ground. It should be done, right?”</p>
<p>As she spoke, Wang Lu had already taken out the item from the cave. Zhou Wen had seen what she had previously placed inside. It was a very small saber.</p>
<p>Now, Wang Lu took out two sabers.</p>
<p>“Wow, one saber has turned into two. Is this really the Gold Burial Ground?” Zhou Wen extended his hand to take the small saber. The saber looked somewhat strange. The blade was like a piece of pandan leaf, and the scabbard was the same. It was probably made of Essence Gold. From the looks of it, it seemed pretty good.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pulled the tiny saber out of its sheath, and Wang Lu also unsheathed the tiny saber in her hand. The two sabers had a cold, oppressive glint, making one’s hair stand on end. They looked identical.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew at a glance that it was a good saber, and it wasn’t an ordinary one.</p>
<p>“That’s right. This place is really a Gold Burial Ground. Let’s quickly put a Mythical Companion Egg inside.” As Wang Lu spoke, she gave Zhou Wen another look before looking at the tiny saber in his hand.</p>
<p>“Alright, quickly put the Mythical Companion Egg in. That way, we can have two Mythical Companion Eggs. When the time comes, I’ll have one, and you can have one…” Zhou Wen said as though he had thought of something. He suddenly changed his words and said, “Let’s think it through. The item that was placed inside the second time disappeared. To be safe, let’s try again.”</p>
<p>With that said, Zhou Wen placed the tiny saber in his hand into the hole and continued observing the situation inside with Truth Listener.</p>
<p>The strange energy fluctuation in the cave stirred once again, but this time, Zhou Wen clearly felt that the strange energy fluctuation was much weaker. Not only was it weaker, but it was also very unstable.</p>
<p>Gradually, Zhou Wen realized that in the hole where Truth Listener originally couldn’t hear anything, he could vaguely hear some movement. It was as though something was moving inside.</p>
<p>This time, the energy fluctuation clearly lasted longer than before. After a while, the strange power in the cave decreased significantly. Zhou Wen could roughly hear the situation inside.</p>
<p>He realized that there was a tiny beast inside the cave. Zhou Wen couldn’t tell what it was. It looked a little like a squirrel, but it wasn’t exactly the same. It looked much better than a rat. Its body was slender, and its eyes were huge. Its tail was also very large and fluffy.</p>
<p>Is this fellow a ferret? However, a ferret shouldn’t be living in a mud wall. It should be in the forest, right? Could it be a weasel? Zhou Wen had never seen a weasel before, but the more he thought about it, the more likely it was.</p>
<p>At that moment, the tiny beast was holding the small saber with its two glowing paws. Its eyes were wide open like two little light bulbs staring at the empty space in front of it. From its eyes, a strange light shot out. It was like a three-dimensional printer in a science fiction movie. The light actually printed out a small sheathed saber out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Although Truth Listener couldn’t hear the trajectory of the light beams, it could sense an energy fluctuation shoot out from its eyes before gradually molding the tiny saber in midair.</p>
<p>The portion of the saber’s blade had been completed, but it was still short of the handle. The beast seemed to be lacking in Essence Energy. The ripples that shot out from its eyes were intermittent, as though they would disappear at any moment.</p>
<p>The beast’s fur stood up as it seemed to steel itself. It tried its best to shoot out rays of light from its eyes. Finally, it finished the last portion of the saber handle.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The small saber fell to the ground together with the small saber in its claws. The two small sabers were identical, with no visible difference.</p>
<p>However, the beast was so tired that it sprawled in the hole with its limbs spread out. It stuck out its tiny tongue and panted. It looked like it had consumed a lot of energy.</p>
<p>“It should be done, right?” Zhou Wen muttered to himself before reaching into the cave.</p>
<p>The beast immediately got up and dragged its tired body to the back of the cave.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached in and took out the two sabers. He even unsheathed them and compared them. Indeed, they were identical. It didn’t look any different.</p>
<p>“It’s really identical. Quickly take out the Mythical Companion Egg and put it in.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he noticed the beast’s eyes lighting up. Even its ears pricked up as it wore an excited and expectant look.</p>
<p>“Isn’t the Companion Egg with you?” Wang Lu retorted.</p>
<p>“No way. I thought it was you. Didn’t you bring it?” Zhou Wen feigned surprise.</p>
<p>“No, I thought you brought it. What do we do now?” Wang Lu asked.</p>
<p>“Then let’s try it next time,” Zhou Wen said as he turned to leave. Wang Lu followed him.</p>
<p>The beast in the hole was stunned for a full second before it suddenly screamed and crawled out of the hole.</p>
<h3 id='chapter546'>Chapter 546 Revenge</h3>
<p>The beast transformed into a stream of light as it screamed and charged at Zhou Wen. Unfortunately, it had expended too much Essence Energy. Zhou Wen circulated the Demonic Astral Wheel with one hand and a powerful suction force sucked the beast into his palm. No matter how hard the beast struggled, it couldn’t escape.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t attack it directly because he felt that the beast was likely to be proficient in underground escaping abilities. If it escaped underground, it would be difficult to capture it.</p>
<p>Now that it had rushed out and left the ground, it was naturally the best outcome for him.</p>
<p>“Forget it. Let it go. It hasn’t harmed anyone. It has only cheated people of things,” said Wang Lu.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that killing the beast wouldn’t have a high chance of dropping a Companion Egg. After all, he had already obtained two tiny sabers. It didn’t matter if he let it go.</p>
<p>The power of the Demonic Astral Wheel in Zhou Wen’s hand dissipated, and after landing on the ground, the beast immediately vanished.</p>
<p>It really knows how to use Earth Escape. Zhou Wen was somewhat envious. Earth Escape was extremely practical. It was even more practical than flying. Unfortunately, it wasn’t produced in many places. If he wanted to learn it, he had to depend on luck. He couldn’t buy it even if he had the money.</p>
<p>“That little beast almost died from exhaustion in order to replicate those two sabers. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been so easily caught by me. What saber is this?” Zhou Wen returned the two tiny sabers to Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“You already have a Bamboo Blade, yet you don’t recognize the Orchid Blade of the Plum, Orchid, Bamboo, and Chrysanthemum Blades?” Wang Lu looked at Zhou Wen in surprise.</p>
<p>“You’re telling me that this tiny saber is the Orchid Blade of the Four Gentlemen Blades?” Zhou Wen immediately knew that he had underestimated the little beast.</p>
<p>Initially, he thought that it was just an ordinary Essence Gold saber. It was not surprising that the little beast could replicate it. However, he didn’t expect it to be the Orchid Blade of the Four Gentlemen Blades.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had the Bamboo Blade, so he knew that the Four Gentlemen Blades were extraordinary. Their toughness was comparable to a Mythical creature’s body, and they were extremely rare Essence Gold weapons.</p>
<p>Outside the game, Zhou Wen used Bamboo Blade more than the Overlord Sword because although Overlord Sword’s sword beam was powerful, the sword’s blade was too weak. It was very likely to snap when colliding with powerful forces.</p>
<p>As for Bamboo Blade, it didn’t have any problems in this aspect. Even in a battle with Mythical creatures, it had never been damaged. Just this point alone was enough to prove the value of the Four Gentlemen Blades.</p>
<p>The quality of the Orchid Blade was likely to be the same as the Bamboo Blade; however, it was a little small. Yet, that little beast had actually been able to duplicate the Orchid Blade. This ability was really a little abnormal.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had heard that the Four Gentlemen Blades would bring ill fate to their owners. Now, the Orchid Blade had turned into three. He didn’t know if Wang Lu’s luck could block the ominous fate brought by three Orchid Blades.</p>
<p>“Two Orchid Blades were replicated. Each of us can have one.” Wang Lu handed one of the Orchid Blades to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head and said, “I don’t have your luck. I’ve been unlucky enough recently. How am I supposed to survive if I hold the Orchid Blade? You should keep it yourself.”</p>
<p>However, Wang Lu stuffed the Orchid Blade into Zhou Wen’s hand. “Take a closer look. Although the replica looks similar to the real one, there are still some differences. This replica Orchid Blade definitely doesn’t have the ominous problems that plague the real Orchid Blade.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen picked up the Orchid Blade in his hand and compared it with the real Orchid Blade that Wang Lu had mentioned. However, in terms of external superficialities, it didn’t seem any different.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tested the sharpness and toughness of the replica and realized that it was very similar to the real Four Gentlemen Blades. He couldn’t tell what was different.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen look at her suspiciously, Wang Lu said with a smile, “Don’t worry about using it. I can sense that there’s no ominous power in the replica.”</p>
<p>Since Wang Lu was so certain, Zhou Wen accepted the replica Orchid Blade. Although it was fake, it likely wasn’t inferior to the real deal as a weapon. Furthermore, it wouldn’t be detrimental to its owner like the real one.</p>
<p>The secret of the Gold Burial Ground had been cracked. There was no point in staying here any longer. Zhou Wen and Wang Lu headed for the exit of the underground Ancient City.</p>
<p>After walking for a while, Zhou Wen realized that the little beast had poked its head out from a hole in the distance and was looking at them.</p>
<p>They were walking ahead; yet, the fella continued following them without giving up. It was clearly waiting for an opportunity to take revenge.</p>
<p>Since the little beast wasn’t very aggressive and it hadn’t harmed other students, Zhou Wen ignored it and thought that it wouldn’t be able to keep up after they exited the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>However, he never expected that after leaving the underground Ancient City, the little beast would continue following him. After leaving the dimensional zone, Zhou Wen’s Truth Listener ability discovered that it had been traveling underground all this time. It had actually followed them onto campus.</p>
<p>This fellow can actually break out of the seal? Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. After all, there weren’t many break-out creatures nowadays.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen remained unperturbed as he pretended that he didn’t notice it. He secretly sent a message to Wang Lu on his phone, telling her to be careful.</p>
<p>When they separated in front of their dorms, Wang Lu made a face at Zhou Wen and sent him a message. “It’s best you be careful. I believe it will definitely seek you out.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought that it made sense. With Wang Lu’s luck, even if the little beast wanted to seek revenge, it would definitely come to him instead of Wang Lu.</p>
<p>After returning to his dorm, Zhou Wen realized that the little beast had indeed followed him in. It furtively hid in his building furtively, but it didn’t dare attack Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it knew how powerful Zhou Wen was. It didn’t dare risk its life to fight Zhou Wen. All it did was secretly exact revenge on him.</p>
<p>As it knew how to escape through the earth, it would be difficult to attack it again if he failed to take it down with a single strike. Zhou Wen pretended not to see it and waited for it to leave the ground before attacking.</p>
<p>He got onto bed and gamed on his phone. He also slowly drank the herbal tea that he had brewed. Although his body was in a good condition recently and hadn’t lost much blood, he still needed to maintain his health. He had to be prepared. What if he bled heavily in the future?</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen grinded the dungeons, he waited for the little beast to reveal itself. However, the little beast was very careful. It hid in a wall corner, behind the closet, and various spots. It peeked its head out from time to time without daring to come over.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw that it didn’t dare come over while he gamed, he locked his phone and pretended to be asleep.</p>
<p>The little beast was just too careful. It only began to quietly crawl over and hide under Zhou Wen’s bed after he faked sleep.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally believed that the little beast would attack him at once. Once it left the ground, he would grab it.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, the little beast suddenly changed its target and when it reached the bottom of Zhou Wen’s bed, it pounced at something underneath.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen listened carefully. The little beast had pounced on an iron lump and hugged it with its paws. It opened its mouth and bit it, producing creaking sounds.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen recall that he had obtained a treasure map from Earth Temple and had dug it up. However, Zhou Wen’s treasure map had led him to a dimensional doll. He didn’t know what kind of plant-type dimensional creature it was.</p>
<p>Later, he had saved the baby. The baby had given him a metal lump that resembled a walnut. Zhou Wen studied it for a long time but failed to figure out what it was. He had thrown it under the bed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter547'>Chapter 547 Three Heads and Six Arms</h3>
<p>The tiny beast originally wanted to launch a sneak attack on Zhou Wen, but after discovering the item that resembled a metal walnut, it gave up. It sprawled on the metal walnut and gnawed at it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that its teeth were already creating sparks from gnawing on the metal, but it couldn’t tear the outer shell of the metal walnut apart.</p>
<p>This fellow definitely knows something valuable when it sees it. Could it be that the metal walnut is really something good? After studying it for a period of time, Zhou Wen still couldn’t figure out what the metal walnut was. He thought it was a special metal and planned on finding an opportunity to melt it into a saber or something.</p>
<p>But now, looking at how the little beast wanted to eat the metal walnut, Zhou Wen felt that the walnut wasn’t just as simple as a piece of metal.</p>
<p>The tiny beast was good at replicating, and it had definitely seen a lot of treasures. Moreover, it knew how to hide underground. What kind of metal could it not find underground? It definitely didn’t want to eat the metal on the metal walnut’s surface. It was very likely that there was something inside the metal walnut which had made it forget about revenge.</p>
<p>With its cautious personality, it actually dared to cause such a commotion under Zhou Wen’s bed. Clearly, the item in the metal walnut was extremely attractive to it, making it lose its rationality.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned over and got off the bed. He lifted the bedsheets and looked inside. He saw that the tiny beast was still chewing on the metal walnut. It was as though it had been possessed. It didn’t even seem to notice that Zhou Wen was looking at it as it continued gnawing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out and picked it up.</p>
<p>However, the tiny beast’s four paws had the metal walnut in a firm grip. No matter how hard Zhou Wen pulled, it wouldn’t budge. When he pulled out the metal walnut, the tiny beast came out with it, its paws still on the walnut.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, what’s inside this metal walnut is no trifling matter. Zhou Wen released his hand. The tiny beast didn’t run, instead, it sprawled on the metal walnut and continued gnawing.</p>
<p>This fellow sure is greedy. Zhou Wen shook his head. Humans die for wealth, birds die for food. This little beast had sacrificed its life for a metal walnut. Its intelligence was truly worrying.</p>
<p>Since the tiny beast couldn’t bite through it, Zhou Wen ignored it and let it slowly gnaw at it while he carefully studied the metal walnut.</p>
<p>Truth Listener’s powers couldn’t hear what was inside the metal walnut. It seemed to be solid metal at its core. Doctor Darkness’s Light of Penetration couldn’t penetrate the metal either.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t sense any special energy fluctuations from the metal walnut. This left him puzzled. He didn’t know what could be inside such a metal lump.</p>
<p>He attempted to slash with Overlord Sword, but the sword beam that possessed Ever-Victorious only left a white mark on the metal walnut.</p>
<p>After a while, Zhou Wen realized that the tiny beast had actually produced a shallow bite mark on the metal walnut. At this speed, he didn’t know when it would be able to bite through it.</p>
<p>The tiny beast forgot about running as it greedily nibbled on it. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and placed the metal walnut and the little beast into the chaos space.</p>
<p>In the chaos space, the tiny beast continued nibbling on the metal walnut as if it was possessed.</p>
<p>Before the Golden Battle God Halberd respawned, Zhou Wen took out a Buddhist scripture and pondered as he read it. Could the Eight Perfections correspond to the Eight Consciousnesses?</p>
<p>Six hundred volumes of the Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra are condensed into the Diamond Sutra. The Diamond Sutra is also condensed into the Heart Sutra. It can be said that the Heart Sutra is the essence of the Great Perfection of Wisdom. And its true meaning lies in the Eighth Consciousnesses. It’s also known as Tathagatagarbha Thought, and it’s also known as Ālayavijñāna. However, this is the concept and essence of the Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra. The Small Perfection of Wisdom I cultivate seems somewhat different. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that something was amiss. He then looked at the other information.</p>
<p>He failed to figure out anything new even when the Golden Battle God Halberd respawned. He went to grind the Golden Battle God Halberd and Medusa, but they only dropped stat crystals after expending all his efforts. It made Zhou Wen suspect that the Orchid Blade replica had affected the light that shone on him from providence.</p>
<p>Ah Sheng said that there’s a one-third chance. It should drop next time, right? Although Zhou Wen was anxious, he didn’t have any good ideas. All he could do was wait for tomorrow.</p>
<p>After grinding the rare dimensional creatures again, he was quite lucky this time. Another Three-Eyed Vajra Malla Companion Egg dropped. Zhou Wen hatched it and kept it for future fusions.</p>
<p>After finishing his set of grinding, Zhou Wen began studying his Life Providence, Eight Perfections Wisdom, again. Only by condensing a Life Soul could he learn the Golden Battle God Halberd’s skill.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, are you busy? Do you have time to come with me to Dragon Gate Grotto?” Li Xuan suddenly came to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Li Xuan had been cultivating diligently recently and seldom came out. For him to take the initiative to look for Zhou Wen was definitely something.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Zhou Wen agreed.</p>
<p>The two of them arranged to meet in front of Dragon Gate Grotto. When Zhou Wen arrived, he realized that apart from Li Xuan, Feng Qiuyan and Gu Dian from the Xuanwen Club were present as well as Ming Xiu.</p>
<p>“Now that Zhou Wen is here, I’ll make things clear first before we enter.” Li Xuan recounted what had happened.</p>
<p>Li Xuan had been cultivating diligently recently. He had gone to many dimensional zones to hone his combat abilities. He had discovered a strange dimensional creature in Dragon Gate Grotto’s Southernmost Cave. He had never seen it before.</p>
<p>While battling the dimensional creature, Li Xuan had nearly been killed. Thankfully, he had escaped.</p>
<p>The reason he had called them over was to let them take a look and see if there was a chance of killing that dimensional creature.</p>
<p>According to Li Xuan’s description, the dimensional creature was somewhat different from the other dimensional creatures in Dragon Gate Grotto. The Dragon Gate Grotto’s ordinary dimensional creatures were Warriors, Vajra Mallas, Fairies, and Stone Beasts.</p>
<p>However, that dimensional creature looked as ugly and terrifying as a devil.</p>
<p>After arriving outside the southernmost Cave, Li Xuan said to Zhou Wen and company, “You aren’t familiar with that dimensional creature. Don’t attack first. I’ll fight it first. Watch by the side. It’s best if you can think of a way to counter it. It won’t be too late to attack then.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, Feng Qiuyan, Gu Dian, and Ming Xiu nodded in agreement. The five of them entered the Southernmost Cave together.</p>
<p>There were some Warriors in the Southernmost Cave, but they were not as strong as the Vajra Mallas of the Myriad Buddha Cave. The five of them easily stormed their way in. When they arrived at a stone cave, they saw a three-headed, six-armed monster that looked like black iron rush out of the cave.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the three heads of the dimensional creature. Each face looked more terrifying than the other. All of them looked like evil ghosts. The only difference was that the head in the middle had a single horn while the other two had either two or three horns.</p>
<p>In each of his six hands was a hoop. The hoops were as thick as an infant’s arm and were shimmering with golden light. They looked like they were made of gold and there were many mysterious patterns engraved on them.</p>
<h3 id='chapter548'>Chapter 548 Super Self-Recovery</h3>
<p>Li Xuan directly used his Life Soul. His body was tightly wrapped by the black carapace, and his eyes had turned red. He looked different from his usual demeanor and looked sinister.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s speed was very fast, leaving behind afterimages as he rushed in front of the monster. His body swayed left and right as he dodged the monster’s hoop attacks. He held an Epic Companion Beast saber in his hand and slashed at the monster’s body, but it was blocked by a hoop.</p>
<p>The monster was indeed very powerful. The six hoops delivered strange attacks, preventing Li Xuan’s saber from touching him. All he could do was constantly shift his position.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s moves and movement techniques were exquisite. They looked extremely beautiful. It could be said to be a textbook example, without any flaws.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen felt that this wasn’t Li Xuan. The Li Xuan he knew wasn’t someone who pursued perfection.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t seen Li Xuan rush forward, Zhou Wen would have believed that the person inside the carapace was Li Mobai.</p>
<p>Is it really good to have such a change? Zhou Wen frowned slightly. If a person’s goal was something he didn’t like, Zhou Wen doubted he could go far.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan’s moves are very powerful. I can’t find any flaws, but I have a nagging feeling that something’s amiss,” Feng Qiuyan said as he watched Li Xuan battle the monster.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu nodded and said, “I also find it a little strange. It’s very strong, but it also feels a little odd. I remember seeing Li Xuan fight in the past. His style isn’t like that, right?”</p>
<p>“Coach, what do you think?” Feng Qiuyan asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Not everyone knows the path to take when they are born. They have to slowly experiment. Some people quickly find their own paths, but some people can walk their entire lives only to end up meandering down the wrong path. In fact, I don’t know which path is right or which path is wrong. Li Xuan’s path ultimately needs to be taken by him. I believe that no matter how difficult it is, he will definitely be able to continue down the path,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s saber constantly clashed with the monster’s golden hoop, but Li Xuan kept retreating. The monster’s strength and speed were above his. His saber was unable to penetrate the golden bangle’s defenses. Instead, he was forced to constantly retreat.</p>
<p>After watching for a while, Zhou Wen roughly understood that the monster had Epic levels of Strength and Constitution. Its body was extremely strong, and with its immense strength, even with Zhou Wen’s Constitution, he would probably only be able to tie with him.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s family had plenty of resources, so he had a large number of stat crystals to use. He hadn’t advanced to the Epic stage for long, but his various stats were almost maxed out. However, he couldn’t see his stats. Zhou Wen estimated that his basic stats were about 40 points. Even if it wasn’t, it was probably around 38 or 39.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, Li Xuan cultivated in the Invincible Connate Divine Art, so he shouldn’t have been at a disadvantage in terms of Constitution and Strength. However, he was overly focused on perfection in his moves, causing him to be constantly thrown back by the monster.</p>
<p>“I’m quite aware of its abilities. Let’s go,” Gu Dian said.</p>
<p>“Wait a little longer. I want to watch a little longer.” Zhou Wen stopped them and watched Li Xuan continue fighting.</p>
<p>Gu Dian didn’t ask why. Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu also stopped as they continued watching the battle.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, it’s about time. Hurry up and attack,” Li Xuan shouted at Zhou Wen as he retreated.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t need our help with such a weak dimensional creature, right?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Bullsh*t. If I didn’t need you, would I have called you here?” Li Xuan cursed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen said with a grin, “Didn’t you call us here to show us how amazing you are when slaying monsters? I understand.”</p>
<p>“Understand my ass. Hurry up and attack. I can’t hold on any longer.” Li Xuan was already forced to a corner of the cave. There was no way out.</p>
<p>“Are you lying to me again?” Zhou Wen stood firmly outside the cave, refusing to enter.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen not moving, Feng Qiuyan, Ming Xiu, and Gu Dian didn’t move either. Li Xuan had been forced to the point of having no time to bicker with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Ka-Cha!</p>
<p>There was no room for retreat. Li Xuan, who was leaning against the stone wall, had his arm struck by the monster’s golden hoop. The carapace on his body cracked, and his bones seemed to fracture from the impact. His left arm immediately drooped down.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Li Xuan’s movement technique was good enough, or the strike would have smashed on his head.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, stop fooling around. Are you trying to kill me?” Li Xuan rolled to the side in a sorry state as he yelled.</p>
<p>“I’m not fooling around. The Li Xuan I know doesn’t need help when killing such a dimensional creature, right?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>Li Xuan fell silent as he constantly changed his movement techniques. He brandished his saber with his other hand to circle around the monster, but he couldn’t put up a fight even with two hands. Now, it was even worse after he had one arm injured. The situation was becoming more and more harrowing.</p>
<p>“Coach, will it be dangerous?” Ming Xiu asked worriedly.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. He still has energy left.” Zhou Wen knew Li Xuan too well.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what Life Soul Li Xuan had, but his Life Providence meant that he wouldn’t be killed so easily. Or rather, he wasn’t using his best strengths.</p>
<p>He was escaping from his past self. He wanted to become as mature and steady as Li Mobai so that he could use his exquisite techniques and schemes to defeat his opponent.</p>
<p>His talent was indeed very good, and his technique was also perfect. However, his personality was not compatible with his technique. This made his technique look powerful, but it lacked the decisiveness.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>More and more spots on Li Xuan’s carapace cracked as his injuries worsened.</p>
<p>“Coach, are you sure things will be fine? I think Li Xuan is about to die. Let’s go,” Feng Qiuyan said.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen saw that Li Xuan was still planning on winning using techniques. He knew that if this carried on, he might really die. He nodded and prepared to rush in.</p>
<p>“Stop right there. No one is to enter,” Li Xuan suddenly said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company stopped as they watched Li Xuan battle the three-headed, six-armed monster. He was still persisting with perfecting his techniques, but his injuries were rapidly recovering.</p>
<p>The broken carapace on his body was repaired automatically in just a moment, and the repair speed accelerated. Towards the end, the golden hoops sent him flying upon impact, but in the next second, he stood up again, and the broken carapace was restored to its original state in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>His recovery ability is much stronger than when he was at the Legendary stage! Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be surprised. Such a recovery ability virtually meant an undying body. Unless he was hit by a fatal blow, it was nearly impossible to kill him.</p>
<p>Gradually, Zhou Wen felt that Li Xuan’s aura was a little different. His moves were still pursuing perfection, but they were becoming more and more sinister.</p>
<p>549 Fated to be Beaten Up</p>
<p>“Coach, did you notice that Li Xuan’s bizarre armor seems a little strange?” Feng Qiuyan said as he stared at the carapace on Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“It’s indeed a little strange.” Zhou Wen had long discovered it.</p>
<p>Every time Li Xuan’s carapace was shattered and restored, it would become even more resilient. The monster caused less damage when smashing into his self-healing carapace.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this ability seemed to have no upper limit. It could be shattered repeatedly. Every self-recovery made it stronger. After a few consecutive rounds of self-recovery, the monster’s golden hoop could only cause him minimal damage.</p>
<p>Why is Li Xuan learning from Li Mobai? His Life Providence and Life Soul mean he’s born to be beaten up and injured. How can he become stronger without being beaten up? It’s a waste to learn from Li Mobai! Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was clearly the first person to realize that there was something wrong with his Life Soul. This was because his Life Soul had been condensed under Li Mobai’s pressure. He had even absorbed Li Mobai’s Evil King Gu. Even he himself knew little about his Life Soul. He even believed Li Mobai’s words—his Life Soul was a failed Life Soul.</p>
<p>Indeed, his Life Soul was different from Li Mobai’s expectations, it did not have the Evil King Gu as its primary core; it only absorbed a portion of the Evil King Gu’s characteristics and formed its own Life Soul.</p>
<p>His Life Soul had parts of the Evil King Gu’s characteristics, but they were not completely the same.</p>
<p>Previously, Li Xuan blamed himself. He felt that he needed to mature as soon as possible and become the pillar of support for his family like Li Mobai. Therefore, he deliberately trained himself, hoping to be stronger than Li Mobai.</p>
<p>He wanted to surpass Li Mobai in all aspects, but in the end, he walked a path that was not suitable for him at all. He had been training his skills all this time, trying his best to avoid getting injured. Unbeknownst to him, his Life Soul only became stronger after being injured. He had taken a long detour for nothing.</p>
<p>It was only today that he discovered the secrets of his Life Soul after being injured continuously. He could not help but feel overjoyed.</p>
<p>“To seek victory in defeat, to rebuild a kingdom that belongs to you from ruins. Such strength is similar to a phoenix’s nirvana. It’s a very powerful Life Soul,” Feng Qiuyan said seriously.</p>
<p>Anyone who fought Li Xuan would be under immense pressure. If they couldn’t kill him in one fell swoop, he would become stronger the more they fought. In the end, the opponent might be the one to die.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Li Xuan and felt that his Life Soul wasn’t just becoming strong from every shattering. Zhou Wen vaguely felt that every time the carapace shattered and healed, it would gain an additional sinister power.</p>
<p>The feeling was very strange. Zhou Wen couldn’t tell what it was, but he kept feeling that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Finally, Zhou Wen knew what was amiss. Li Xuan punched out and he realized that his punch was somewhat similar to a monster’s attack. The way he used it was very similar to the three-headed, six-armed monster.</p>
<p>However, if Zhou Wen didn’t remember wrongly, this move was likely the monster’s Essence Energy Skill. It wasn’t something that could be learned just from watching. One had to know the way to circulate Essence Energy.</p>
<p>Li Xuan definitely didn’t know such an Essence Energy Skill in the past. Now that he had used it, there was only one possibility—he had actually learned the three-headed, six-armed monster’s Essence Energy Skill while battling it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but recall something. Li Mobai once said that his Life Soul was called Evil King Gu, a Life Soul formed from cultivating a secret Essence Energy Art from the South District.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had once heard of some legends. South District’s Gu techniques placed many different kinds of poisonous worms and insects in a jar. They constantly hunted each other out of hunger, and the last poisonous worm to survive was a Gu. Not only was this Gu the strongest poisonous object, but it also possessed the ability to hunt and devour other poisonous worms.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s Life Soul wasn’t only becoming stronger as it shattered, but it could also learn the enemy’s Essence Energy Skill in battle. It was very similar to the legends of Gu.</p>
<p>How much power has Li Xuan’s Life Soul inherited from Li Mobai’s Evil King Gu? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Li Xuan had already gained the upper hand. When the golden hoops struck him, there were no longer any cracks on the armor. All it could do was make Li Xuan retreat half a step.</p>
<p>Li Xuan no longer dodged the monster’s golden hoops. While they smashed on his body, his saber slashed at the monster’s body. The battle between the man and monster felt like a battle between two monsters.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was struck by the golden hoops and his injuries rapidly healed. As for the monster’s body, it couldn’t heal from the saber slashes. In this constant battle, the monster that was originally terrifying looked weaker and weaker. It even felt like it was trembling.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu watched with a complicated expression. He wondered if death was the only option if he couldn’t kill Li Xuan with his strike.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan frowned as he pondered. If he were to fight Li Xuan, how could he win? After thinking for a long time, there was only one solution. He had to kill him before he became stronger.</p>
<p>Ka-Cha!</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s strength had clearly increased by a lot. After countless slashes, he cut off one of the monster’s heads.</p>
<p>The monster seemed to be a little afraid as it turned around and ran, not daring to fight Li Xuan again.</p>
<p>“Trying to run after hitting me so many times? It’s too late!” Li Xuan refused to give up. With a flash, he chased after the monster like a phantom.</p>
<p>The monster was truly afraid. It didn’t dare turn back to fight Li Xuan. After Li Xuan caught up with it, it took him a few slashes to slice off the remaining two heads.</p>
<p>Seeing the monster collapse at Li Xuan’s feet, Zhou Wen walked over and asked Li Xuan, “Are you alright?”</p>
<p>He had a nagging feeling that Li Xuan’s Life Soul was a little too strange. It gave off a sinister feeling perhaps of the absorption of the Evil King Gu’s characteristics.</p>
<p>Li Xuan dispelled his Life Soul and revealed his body. He sighed softly and said, “From the looks of it, I won’t be able to be a gentleman like Li Mobai in this lifetime. After all, I’m just a foppish guy who doesn’t care about his life.”</p>
<p>“It’s good being foppish.” Zhou Wen laughed. Since Li Xuan could say that, it meant that he was really fine.</p>
<p>“Sigh, so I can be very strong just by casually practicing. I didn’t need to be so serious,” Li Xuan continued sighing.</p>
<p>“That’s a little overboard…” Zhou Wen was rendered speechless.</p>
<p>Just as Li Xuan was about to say something, the three-headed, six-armed monster’s body suddenly moved. It gave Zhou Wen and company a fright as they stared warily at the monster’s corpse. They saw a bright glow in its chest, as though a blob of golden magma was churning.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The corpse suddenly exploded, and a golden object emerged from the corpse.</p>
<p>They took a careful look and realized that it was another dimensional creature. It was different from the three-headed, six-armed monster. It was very normal with only one head and a pair of arms.</p>
<p>However, its appearance was even more terrifying than the three-headed, six-armed monster. Its entire body seemed to be made of gold, and its body did not seem human. It had two horns on its head, and there was a row of bone spurs on its spine. Its fingers were like golden hooks. Standing at half the height of a person, its body was burning with golden light.</p>
<p>With a wave of its hand, the six golden hoops that landed on the ground automatically flew over and covered its limbs and neck. The remaining golden hoop landed in its hand.</p>
<p>The golden hoops shrank automatically and became the size of a bracelet and a choker. Only the golden hoop in its hand remained the same size.</p>
<h3 id='chapter550'>Chapter 550 Golden Hoop</h3>
<p>The golden hoop in the tiny monster’s hand suddenly flung out. It quickly spun and flew towards Li Xuan, who was closest to it.</p>
<p>Li Xuan didn’t dare be careless. He produced his carapace again and slashed at it with his saber.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The saber struck the golden hoop, tipping the front of the golden hoop downwards. However, the backside flipped over and wrapped around Li Xuan’s neck.</p>
<p>This happened so suddenly. In addition to the force from Li Xuan’s strike, the golden hoop’s spin accelerated, preventing Li Xuan from having the time to react. The moment the golden hoop touched his neck, it suddenly contracted, wrapped around his neck, and instantly shrank.</p>
<p>The little monster didn’t sit idle. It flew towards Gu Dian on the other side. Its speed was unbelievably fast, even faster than the three-headed, six-armed monster.</p>
<p>Gu Dian released his strength and threw a punch at the tiny monster. The tiny monster’s claws collided with his fist, and the hook-like claws immediately left several scratch wounds on Gu Dian’s hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Feng Qiuyan had already unsheathed their sabers and slashed at the tiny monster. Ming Xiu’s sword slashed out as well.</p>
<p>The tiny monster’s legs kicked at Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu respectively. Its calf was short, so it couldn’t reach them. However, the golden hoop on its ankle flew out and expanded in size as it flew towards Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu.</p>
<p>Having seen what happened to Li Xuan, Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan didn’t dare to forcefully slash the golden hoop as they retreated.</p>
<p>The tiny monster’s claws met Zhou Wen’s Bamboo Blade. With a clang, the Bamboo Blade slashed at the tiny monster’s wrist and collided with the golden hoop. The tiny monster was sent tumbling backward as Zhou Wen took a few steps back.</p>
<p>How can this fellow’s strength be so powerful? Zhou Wen was alarmed. In terms of pure strength, without the enhancement of his Essence Energy Skill, the tiny monster’s strength was stronger than his.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had 40 Strength. Apart from the Epic creatures like Truth Listener and Banana Fairy, who were stronger than him, he had never seen an Epic creature being able to defeat him in terms of Strength. At most, it was a draw.</p>
<p>If the tiny monster did not have a Life Providence or Life Soul that boosted its Strength, it implied something scary.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu avoided the golden hoop, but the golden hoop seemed to have a life of its own. It spun in the air and charged at them, forcing the two of them to have no choice but to constantly dodge.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s neck was bound as the golden hoop tightened. The carapace on his neck showed strangle marks as the golden hoop continued shrinking. If this continued, the carapace would be crushed and his neck would be severed.</p>
<p>He used his saber to slash at the golden hoop, but it was useless. No matter how hard he pulled, he couldn’t stop the golden hoop from tightening. If it wasn’t for Li Xuan’s carapace’s firmness and his body’s toughness, anyone else would have been strangled by the golden hoop.</p>
<p>Gu Dian swung his fist at the tiny monster again and pincered it with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The tiny monster’s figure rapidly flashed as it swiped its claws. The two golden hoops on its wrist flew out and wrapped themselves around Gu Dian and Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Gu Dian quickly retreated. He looked tall and big, but he wasn’t clumsy at all. He was extremely fast.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s saber slashed at the golden hoop. The golden hoop flipped over and was about to land on Zhou Wen’s head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen dodged using Ghost Steps, escaping the fate of being latched on by the golden hoop. At the same time, he brandished his saber and slashed at the tiny monster. It reached out to remove the golden hoop around its neck and attacked Zhou Wen’s saber.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal was extremely fast. The tiny monster shouldn’t have been able to withstand it, but when Zhou Wen’s saber slashed down, he suddenly felt a huge suction force just as it was about to hit the monster’s neck. The Bamboo Blade involuntarily shifted its trajectory and slammed into the golden hoop.</p>
<p>The golden hoop was like a super magnet that firmly sucked the Bamboo Blade. Zhou Wen tried his best to pull the saber back, but his strength wasn’t as great as the tiny monster’s. The tiny monster screamed as it pulled the golden hoop. Zhou Wen couldn’t stabilize his body as he moved with it.</p>
<p>As for the other golden hoop, it was already spinning in the air to latch onto his head. Zhou Wen had no choice but to give up on dodging with the Bamboo Blade. At the same time, he took out the Orchid Blade and threw it out as a flying knife.</p>
<p>The Orchid Blade transformed into a cold beam of light as it attacked the tiny monster’s abdomen. However, just as it was about to stab into the tiny monster’s abdomen, it was sucked away by the golden hoop, preventing it from harming the tiny monster’s body.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan was already at the Epic stage and his movement techniques were fast enough. He could still dodge the golden hoop’s attacks, but Gu Dian and Ming Xiu had yet to advance to the Epic stage. It was proving difficult for them to dodge.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu dodged twice before he was at his wit’s end. He could only swing his sword at the golden hoop, but then, his sword was suddenly sucked by the hoop. He could only do a flip to avoid being latched onto by the golden hoop.</p>
<p>Gu Dian gripped the golden hoop as it tried to tighten around his body. However, as he resisted using his tight grip, the golden hoop sent his body flying around in the cave. Gu Dian was injured from crashing into the walls.</p>
<p>Li Xuan desperately tugged at the golden hoop around his neck. His carapace had been shattered and the golden hoop had sunken in. He looked like he was about to suffocate.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have time to think. All he wanted to do was kill the tiny monster as soon as possible, or they would be in danger.</p>
<p>He summoned the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, and with a roar, it slapped the tiny monster.</p>
<p>The speed of the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon was far faster than that of the tiny monster. Unable to dodge the attack, it raised its golden hoop to meet the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s palm.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The tiny monster was slammed into the rocky ground along with the golden hoop.</p>
<p>The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon raised its claws, only to see the tiny monster jump out once again. The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s claw was actually unable to smack it to death.</p>
<p>What’s this fellow’s background? Zhou Wen was alarmed as the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon spewed out a mouthful of Dragon Breath Holy Flames.</p>
<p>Under the surge of the Dragon Breath Holy Flames, the tiny monster spun the golden hoop in its hand, absorbing the Holy Flames into the golden hoop. The golden hoop seemed to be a spatial gate. After being sucked in, the dragon breath disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was even more alarmed. He guessed that the tiny monster was likely a Mythical creature. However, its level might not have reached the Mythical stage yet. It was probably similar to Truth Listener and Banana Fairy.</p>
<p>That’s not right. Its situation is more like Demonic Neonate. The six golden hoops are somewhat similar to Demonic Neonate’s ancient sword. What is this fellow? Zhou Wen thought to himself, but he didn’t stop attacking. He summoned the Overlord Sword and slashed his sword beam at the tiny monster.</p>
<p>He didn’t dare to directly slash the golden hoop with his sword again, afraid that the sword would be sucked away.</p>
<p>As the tiny monster dodged the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s attack, it used the golden hoop to devour the sword beam that Zhou Wen slashed out.</p>
<p>However, its stats were still too low. It was slapped by the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, causing its golden body to crack and golden blood to flow out.</p>
<p>The tiny monster screamed again and again, but it was unable to withstand the power of the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. The golden hoop could only absorb attacks that were in energy form, but it was ineffective against physical attacks.</p>
<p>Although it had the effect of sucking weapons, it wasn’t very effective against the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s claws. With a swipe of its claws, the tiny monster’s body cracked and it immediately died.</p>
<h3 id='chapter551'>Chapter 551 Truth Listener“s Chrysalis</h3>
<p>As soon as the tiny monster died, the golden hoop seemed to lose its life. One by one, they returned to their original size and fell to the ground with tinkling sounds.</p>
<p>“Six-Winged Guardian Dragon… So that’s Coach’s Companion Beast…” Ming Xiu recognized the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon at a glance. In fact, everyone recognized the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. After all, it was the first Companion Beast on the ranking.</p>
<p>“As expected of Coach. He already has a Mythical pet so quickly.” However, Feng Qiuyan felt that it was only natural.</p>
<p>“I’m lucky. I got lucky during a battle between two Mythical creatures.” Zhou Wen was telling the truth. Then, he looked at Li Xuan and asked, “Are you alright?”</p>
<p>The carapace on Li Xuan’s neck had completely shattered. A purple mark lined his neck, and his bones had almost snapped. If he had been any later, his Life Providence probably wouldn’t have been able to save his life. With his head lopped off, no matter how strong his recovery abilities were, it was unlikely he could regrow it.</p>
<p>“I’m fine. I don’t know what weapon that golden hoop is. It was terrifying.” Li Xuan touched his neck and gritted his teeth in pain.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he had powerful recovery abilities. Without the restrictions of the golden hoop, he recovered in moments. There were no signs of injury.</p>
<p>However, this also gave Li Xuan a wake-up call. Although his body and Life Soul were very strong, it didn’t make him truly invincible. Against special attacks, it was useless no matter how strong his body and Life Soul’s self-healing abilities were.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen picked up the Orchid Blade, Bamboo Blade, and a golden hoop. Now that the golden hoop no longer had any magnetic force, the Orchid Blade and Bamboo Blade automatically separated from it. When Zhou Wen touched the golden hoop, there wasn’t any magnetic force.</p>
<p>“Look,” Ming Xiu said, pointing at the tiny monster’s corpse.</p>
<p>They looked across and saw that the tiny monster’s golden body was rapidly melting, quickly turning into a pool of golden liquid. It looked like a pool of blood, but the color was different.</p>
<p>Within that liquid was a crystal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company were somewhat surprised. Reality wasn’t a game where corpses vanished. Typically, after a dimensional creature died, it rotted quickly, but it wouldn’t be that fast. Typically, it would take at least two to three days to decompose.</p>
<p>What was even more strange was that the six golden hoops didn’t disintegrate together. Logically speaking, the golden hoops were part of the dimensional creature. Once a dimensional creature died, the golden hoops should have disintegrated. However, the six golden hoops remained intact. They were still as hard as before.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his hand and sucked the golden dimensional crystal into his palm. He wiped away the golden liquid on it before throwing it at Li Xuan.</p>
<p>They were originally here to help Li Xuan, so they naturally had to give any spoils to him.</p>
<p>Li Xuan didn’t stand on ceremony as he caught the crystal and put it away with a grin.</p>
<p>“Do you want these golden hoops?” Zhou Wen pointed at the other golden hoops on the ground and asked.</p>
<p>“Objects on a monster would usually disintegrate. What’s the use of having them? They can’t be used as weapons,” Ming Xiu said.</p>
<p>“These golden hoops seem a little special. Perhaps they won’t disintegrate.” Zhou Wen tried injecting his Essence Energy into a golden hoop, but there was no reaction.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu shook his head and said, “Regardless of whether they disintegrate, I don’t use such ring-type weapons. They’re useless for me.”</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan and Gu Dian also shook their heads, indicating their lack of interest in them. Zhou Wen didn’t stand on ceremony. He picked up the golden hoops and planned on studying them and figuring out what they were.</p>
<p>This thing was actually so powerful in the hands of an Epic creature. If it didn’t disintegrate and disappear, he could study how it could be used. What if it could be used?</p>
<p>After this trip, Li Xuan returned to his former self. He felt a lot more relaxed, unlike the mentally burdened person he was before.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t reduce the amount of training he did. He only changed the training method. In the past, he had been training his skills crazily. Now, he was also practicing his skills. However, he would often challenge stronger dimensional creatures, allowing his carapace to be injured before healing so as to constantly improve.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen returned to his dorm and studied the hoops for a while, but no matter what kind of Essence Energy he injected, the golden hoops didn’t react.</p>
<p>Could it be that humans really can’t use a dimensional creature’s weapon? Zhou Wen had no choice but to place the golden hoops on the table to see if they would disintegrate over time.</p>
<p>Some dimensional creatures disintegrated relatively slowly. Perhaps the hoops would take several days to disintegrate and disappear.</p>
<p>In the chaos space, the tiny beast was still gnawing on the metal walnut with all its might. However, it had not achieved much. There were still shallow teeth marks, and it did not seem to have made much progress.</p>
<p>He released Banana Fairy, Truth Listener, Doctor Darkness, and Demonic Neonate to give them a breather. They had some self-awareness. Usually, if he didn’t release them for a long time, they would become a little irritable, especially Demonic Neonate and Banana Fairy. If it wasn’t necessary, they hated being in tattoo form.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy leaned on Zhou Wen’s shoulder as she curiously watched him game. She was eager to try.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate stood in a dark corner with the ancient sword in her arms. If one didn’t pay attention, one wouldn’t be able to sense her existence at all.</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness stood there in a daze. It was unknown what he was thinking about.</p>
<p>Previously, when Truth Listener came out, it liked to jump around in the house. This time, it was abnormally quiet. Zhou Wen didn’t hear its voice.</p>
<p>After a while, Zhou Wen was suddenly blinded by a shimmering golden light in the room. He turned his head and saw the six golden hoops on the table. For some reason, they emitted a golden glow and automatically floated up.</p>
<p>The six golden hoops spun. A strange power surged within them as they became smaller and smaller with every spin.</p>
<p>At first, they were still the size of a necklace or bracelet. But later on, they reduced to the size of a ring; yet, continued shrinking.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was feeling alarmed and puzzled, he saw the six golden hoops land and fly towards the table.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen realize that Truth Listener was standing on the table. After the six golden hoops landed, they flew towards Truth Listener’s body.</p>
<p>The six miniature golden hoops were caught onto Truth Listener’s six ears. They looked like six earrings, suiting it in quite a surprising manner.</p>
<p>After the six golden hoops latched on, Truth Listener’s body immediately emitted a golden glow. Wisps of golden light were like silk as they gradually enveloped its body. Soon, it transformed into a golden cocoon.</p>
<p>Is it evolving? Zhou Wen was surprised and delighted. He had never expected the golden hoops to allow Truth Listener to evolve. This was truly a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>After Truth Listener’s evolution, it would definitely be able to evolve to the Mythical stage. When that happened, Zhou Wen would have another super fighter.</p>
<p>I wonder who will be stronger after the evolution—Truth Listener or Tyrant Behemoth? Zhou Wen was delighted. He had not realized that he would be able to evolve Truth Listener from fighting a monster.</p>
<h3 id='chapter552'>Chapter 552 Benevolence of the Battle God</h3>
<p>Why didn’t I encounter such a dimensional creature despite going to Dragon Gate Grotto so many times in-game? After Zhou Wen returned, he entered the game’s Southernmost Cave to take a look. However, there were only a few Warriors and Stone Beasts. There was no such monster.</p>
<p>Not only wasn’t the tiny golden monster seen, but the three-headed, six-armed fellow was also missing.</p>
<p>Truth Listener was put away by Zhou Wen. The process of advancing from an Epic to a Mythical stage was rather lengthy. Tyrant Behemoth had yet to complete its evolution, so Truth Listener probably would take quite some time. He wouldn’t be able to use it anytime soon.</p>
<p>Without Truth Listener’s ability, it was equivalent to having a cheat that gave him an omniscient view turned off. It made Zhou Wen feel a little unaccustomed.</p>
<p>I was a little too reliant on Truth Listener previously. I should take this period of time to recover. The only thing Zhou Wen was worried about was that Truth Listener had yet to complete its evolution. He needed this to happen before he went to Zhuolu otherwise he would be at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>When the Golden Battle God Halberd respawned, Zhou Wen stormed into the Metalwork Temple again. With the Fire Furnace Queen and Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, there was basically no need for Zhou Wen to take action.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen still attempted to control the blood-colored avatar to fight. He switched his Essence Energy Art to the Small Perfection of Wisdom and sensed the changes that Small Perfection of Wisdom and Eight Perfections Wisdom Life Providence brought to his body.</p>
<p>Without Truth Listener, the Eight Perfections Wisdom Life Providence could make Zhou Wen’s six senses extremely sharp. Apart from his hearing being much weaker than Truth Listener’s, his other senses were much stronger.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s nose was even better than a trained police hound. He could distinguish many scents that he couldn’t identify before, and his taste buds had become extremely sensitive. When he ate, he used to only know flavors like sour, sweet, bitter, and spicy. After he activated Eight Perfections Wisdom, he could easily distinguish something.</p>
<p>The only bad thing was that back when he drank the seaweed egg soup from the canteen, he felt that it was fresh and delicious.</p>
<p>However, ever since Zhou Wen drank the seaweed egg soup with Eight Perfections Wisdom activated, he never drank it again.</p>
<p>From the soup, he actually detected the flavor of a fly. His sense of taste was just so sensitive. Zhou Wen felt that as long as he trained, it would be easy for him to tell the year of production for alcohol.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen wasn’t that bored. He didn’t have the time to dabble in those things either. All he did was constantly practice using the Eight Perfections Wisdom.</p>
<p>Gradually, Zhou Wen sensed the benefits of Eight Perfections Wisdom. With his sharp senses, he could discover many things that he usually couldn’t.</p>
<p>His hearing ability aside, his eyes could see further and more clearly. It was like a telescope that allowed him to see the enemy for any preemptive strikes while his sense of smell allowed him to tell the dangers of different poisonous fog.</p>
<p>Some gaseous poisons could not be seen with the naked eye, so this was when his sense of smell became very important.</p>
<p>However, other than that, the Eight Perfections Wisdom didn’t have any other uses. Compared to the other Life Providences, it was a little too simple. Without any outstanding abilities, it only strengthened Zhou Wen’s basic abilities.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen practiced, he grinded. When Demonic Neonate slashed at the Golden Battle God Halberd once again, there was a clang as a golden metal egg fell out.</p>
<p>“An Sheng is really accurate about the one-third probability. It dropped at the first expected value.” Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he hurriedly checked the Companion Egg’s stats.</p>
<p>Golden Battle God Halberd: Mythical</p>
<p>Life Providence: Godly Weapon</p>
<p>Life Soul: Golden Divine Light</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Benevolence of the Battle God</p>
<p>Strength: 80</p>
<p>Speed: 72</p>
<p>Constitution: 79</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 68</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Battle God’s Radiance, Unstoppable</p>
<p>Companion Form: Golden Trident.</p>
<p>The Golden Trident’s stats were rather good—much better than the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon before it was strengthened. However, what puzzled Zhou Wen was why its Wheel of Destiny was called Benevolence of the Battle God.</p>
<p>Could it be that it’s not an offensive miracle like Six-Winged? It can’t be. This is a weapon-type Companion Beast. How can it not be an offensive-type miracle? Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at the Benevolence of the Battle God’s introduction.</p>
<p>Benevolence of the Battle God: Benevolence on the battlefield is to end the enemy’s life and reduce the enemy’s pain. This is the pity of God.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw this note, he immediately felt relieved. It looked like an attack-type miracle.</p>
<p>The golden trident only had two skills. There were certainly several skills missing, but these two skills were very useful.</p>
<p>Battle God’s Radiance was the skill that had instantly killed Zhou Wen. The golden trident glowed brightly as it attacked indiscriminately within a certain range. It was a large AOE attack Essence Energy Skill that was similar to Banana Fairy’s Grand Yin Wind. It consumed a lot of Essence Energy.</p>
<p>Unstoppable was a passive Essence Energy Skill that was similar to Ever-Victorious. Its effects were stronger, and it was exactly what Zhou Wen needed.</p>
<p>Life Providence, Life Soul, and so on needed Zhou Wen’s testing before he knew the specific effects.</p>
<p>He switched back to the Slaughterer Life Soul and used his infinite Essence Energy to hatch the Golden Battle God Halberd.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen held the golden trident in his hand, he knew that the opportunity to kill Torch Dragon had finally arrived.</p>
<p>He took the golden trident to grind Medusa to test its power.</p>
<p>After entering the Medusa temple, the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon restrained Medusa. The tip of the golden trident aimed at Medusa’s heart with Golden Divine Light.</p>
<p>This strike pierced through Medusa’s heart and killed the terrifying existence that had once nearly taken Zhou Wen’s life.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could tell that the golden glow at the tip of the golden trident was likely its Life Soul, Golden Divine Light, but he didn’t see the effects of the Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>Could it be that Medusa is too weak and doesn’t need the Benevolence of the Battle God? With this in mind, Zhou Wen made the golden trident use its miracle to kill some monsters.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen only saw it pierce through the monster’s body and kill it without seeing it deliver any powerful move.</p>
<p>How strange. What kind of miracle is the Benevolence of the Battle God? Why doesn’t it seem to have any effect? Zhou Wen still remembered how gorgeous and dazzling Holy Angel’s Redemption was when John used the miracle. The golden trident was just too disappointing.</p>
<p>Despite such thoughts, Zhou Wen was still very satisfied. The golden trident fulfilled his greatest requirement. It was an excellent weapon that should be able to penetrate Torch Dragon’s body.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Medusa didn’t drop a Companion Egg. All she dropped was a Speed Crystal. It was useless for Zhou Wen as he couldn’t bring it out.</p>
<p>After familiarizing himself with the Golden Battle God Halberd’s abilities and characteristics to the point of using it skillfully, Zhou Wen couldn’t wait to take it, along with Six-Winged, to the Zhuolu ruins.</p>
<p>With the Golden Battle God Halberd and Six-Winged, the Aoyin stone statue that was guarding the door wasn’t able to stand up to them at all. It was instantly killed by the Golden Battle God Halberd. Its ability to devour was useless against the Golden Battle God Halberd.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen entered the temple.</p>
<h3 id='chapter553'>Chapter 553 Think of a Way</h3>
<p>Without Truth Listener, Zhou Wen was at a small disadvantage. However, with the augmentation of Six-Winged’s flying speed and the Transcendent Flying Immortal’s movement techniques, Zhou Wen still found an opportunity.</p>
<p>The Golden Battle God’s halberd stabbed into Torch Dragon’s scales with a glimmer of divine light. Even with such a sharp divine weapon, Zhou Wen still felt a great resistance when tearing apart the scales. It was like a blunt knife slicing through flesh. Although he could stab in, it didn’t feel clean.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon let out a sharp cry after being injured. The scales on its body stood up diagonally as it raised its head to strike backward.</p>
<p>Seeing that the Golden Battle God Halberd failed to stab it to death, Zhou Wen wanted to take the opportunity to strike again, but in the next second, he saw two rows of lanterns-like eyes appear on both sides of Torch Dragon’s body, from head to tail.</p>
<p>Then, that was it. The blood-colored avatar was directly sucked into the Bright Torch Vision World’s world, and the game instantly turned black.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held his phone and lost interest in entering the game again.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon’s entire body was filled with eyes. Unless Zhou Wen’s entire body was covered in mirrors, there was no way he could hide from the activation of the Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>Although the move that covered its body with eyes was only used at the final moment by Torch Dragon, and it was very likely to be greatly limited, no matter how many restrictions it had, as long as it could be used once, Zhou Wen would be doomed. There was no chance of survival.</p>
<p>Suddenly, an idea lit up in Zhou Wen’s mind.</p>
<p>It’s impossible for me to be covered in mirrors. Then, can I turn my armor into a mirror? Zhou Wen thought of this possibility.</p>
<p>The crystal mirror formed by the Sun Beast couldn’t cover his entire body, but if he combined the crystal mirror with another armor-type Companion Beast, would it turn into a mirror-like armor that reflected light?</p>
<p>Although the possibility was very small, he had to give it a try. Otherwise, he would have to find a bigger mirror to completely block his body. If not, it would be impossible for him to dodge Torch Dragon’s final eruption of the Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen only had one Sun Beast on him. The drop rate was pitifully low. After grinding for so long, Zhou Wen had only had one drop.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen did a study and realized that the Sun Beast and Zhou Wen’s armor-type Companion Beasts didn’t have high compatibility. They didn’t even reach 40%, so the success rate definitely wasn’t good.</p>
<p>Even if he succeeded, the outcome might not become a mirror armor as Zhou Wen wanted. Who knew what would happen after the two Companion Beasts combined?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and planned on asking if there was any mirror-like Companion Beast armor. That would save him all the trouble.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sent a message to Li Xuan, but Li Xuan didn’t know where to find such armor.</p>
<p>After asking An Sheng again, An Sheng thought for a while, but he also didn’t think that there would be such an armor. According to him, the armor that was closest to the armor that Zhou Wen mentioned should be an armor made of Ice Nightmares.</p>
<p>However, according to what he knew, Ice Nightmares were Mythical Companion Beasts. Only North District had one, and it belonged to Lance’s family.</p>
<p>However, the armor formed by the Ice Nightmare could not be said to be a complete mirror. It was like a smooth ice surface that could reflect light to a certain extent, but it was not as clear as a real mirror.</p>
<p>So at the end of the day, it’s still impossible? Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, I’ll be away soon. If there’s anything you need, you can call this number.” An Sheng sent a number to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I obtain that Mythical Companion Egg before? However, because I don’t have enough Essence Energy, incubating a Mythical Companion Egg will put my life in danger. Therefore, I can only use some special means. I plan on going to a dimensional zone with rich Essence Energy. Then, I’ll use some special methods to successfully hatch the Mythical Companion Egg. If I’m fast, I’ll be back in a month. If I’m slow, it’ll probably take two to three months,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought and said, “Ah Sheng, I want to go to Zhuolu in the near future.”</p>
<p>“When?” An Sheng didn’t ask why. He knew that Zhou Wen would give it a try after having the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon.</p>
<p>“I haven’t decided on the time yet. I still need to make some preparations. I’ll contact you when I’m ready. It’ll probably take some time.” Zhou Wen wasn’t sure when he would be able to resolve the problem of the mirror armor.</p>
<p>However, even without the mirror armor, Zhou Wen had to make a trip as soon as possible. He couldn’t wait any longer.</p>
<p>No matter how optimistic he was, the former principal probably didn’t have any hope of survival. Now, Zhou Wen only wanted to go in and take a look, or he wouldn’t be able to feel at ease.</p>
<p>If he really couldn’t obtain the mirror armor, Zhou Wen planned on taking a huge mirror made of tempered glass in. He could place the mirror in the chaos space and use it to block Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World when it used it.</p>
<p>This move could only be used in reality. Furthermore, it hadn’t been verified. He didn’t know if an ordinary mirror could block Bright Torch Vision World. Unless it was absolutely necessary, Zhou Wen didn’t want to employ this step.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll hatch the Mythical pet as soon as possible and rush back.” An Sheng went offline after replying to this message.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that An Sheng’s trip was definitely very dangerous. It wasn’t difficult for Zhou Wen to hatch Companion Beasts that were of a higher level, but to ordinary people, it was a grave matter.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only pray that An Sheng would return safely. It was impossible for him to stop him from hatching the Mythical pet.</p>
<p>After entering the temple again, Zhou Wen once again stabbed Torch Dragon with the golden trident. Just like last time, Torch Dragon’s body had countless eyes appear as it used Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>At that instant, Zhou Wen switched to Lost Country and used teleportation to change his location. He wanted to see if he could dodge the Bright Torch Vision World, but it was all in vain. After he appeared from his teleportation, he was directly killed by the Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, other than finding a sufficiently large mirror, the only way is to do it through pet fusion. Zhou Wen really couldn’t think of any other solution.</p>
<p>However, he only had one Sun Beast. Zhou Wen didn’t immediately fuse with it. Instead, he continued grinding the Music Temple to see if he could get another Sun Beast.</p>
<p>At the same time, Zhou Wen began researching the First Order of Chaos. He wanted to see if he could condense a Life Providence using it.</p>
<p>If the First Order of Chaos could condense a Life Providence, it might allow the Invisibility Cloak Companion Egg to hatch again. With the Invisibility Cloak, it might be able to crack the Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>The First Order of Chaos was somewhat similar to the other Essence Energy Art that Zhou Wen had cultivated—Dao Sutra. Zhou Wen cross-checked them and quickly gained insights into the First Order of Chaos.</p>
<p>However, there were still some differences between the two. After studying it for two to three days, Zhou Wen gained insight into many profound mysteries. He vaguely felt that the First Order of Chaos was undergoing some strange changes, as though it was about to condense a Life Providence.</p>
<p>In the past two or three days, Zhou Wen had farmed Medusa and the Golden Trident a few more times, but nothing good dropped. Medusa dropped a skill crystal that Zhou Wen couldn’t absorb.</p>
<p>Is the one-third drop rate An Sheng mentioned true? Zhou Wen was extremely puzzled.</p>
<h3 id='chapter554'>Chapter 554 Breaking the White Cocoon Again</h3>
<p>The one-third probably of what An Sheng said was correct. However, that was the global drop rate across different Mythical creatures. They had never killed the same Mythical creatures consecutively.</p>
<p>In reality, killing a Mythical creature might result in a Mythical creature of the same type taking a long time to come through the dimensional rift. It could take a year or decades. There wasn’t much chance of killing the same Mythical creature.</p>
<p>Some families were rather lucky. They spent very little time researching a Mythical creature. After killing it, they would have Mythical creatures of the same type appear every year for years.</p>
<p>Even after killing many Mythical creatures, the chances of a Companion Egg dropping remained very low. Only when one was extremely lucky would a second Companion Egg of the same type drop.</p>
<p>This was something that only a family with a deep heritage could do. The An family had only just risen to prominence a few years ago. They had killed Mythical creatures, but up till now, they had not seen any Mythical creatures of the same type.</p>
<p>In reality, they hadn’t killed many Mythical creatures. How could they have a lot of experience?</p>
<p>Over time, the An family might have a Mythical Companion Egg of the same type, but the drop rate would probably be less than a third.</p>
<p>This also involved the problem of uniqueness. Mythical Companion Beasts like the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon might produce Companion Beasts of the same type, but for creatures like Banana Fairy and Truth Listener, they were unique. It was impossible to have a completely identical Banana Fairy or Truth Listener appear.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen still didn’t know if the Golden Battle God Halberd and Medusa were unique Mythical Companion Beasts. He could only confirm it after a long time of grinding.</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhou Wen didn’t really care about this problem. He was still studying the First Order of Chaos. Legend had it that it was the Essence Energy Art of the Greek mythology’s Chaos.</p>
<p>Chaos was probably equivalent to the egg that was split apart by Pangu in East District myth. It represented a chaotic world where Yin and Yang had yet to be separated. The Dao Sutra also studied nature.</p>
<p>Although there were some differences between the two, it could be used for reference. It wasn’t difficult for him to understand the profundity of the First Order of Chaos. In just two days, Zhou Wen had a breakthrough.</p>
<p>The Essence Energy in his body circulated continuously, gradually transforming into a strange power that merged with his body and mind.</p>
<p>He couldn’t see the power, but he could sense that it was a Life Providence that Zhou Wen had plenty of experience condensing.</p>
<p>After successfully condensing a Life Providence, Zhou Wen checked his stats. After switching to the First Order of Chaos, there was indeed an additional Life Providence.</p>
<p>Life Providence: Chaos Body</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gave it a try. This Chaos Body was very similar to his Dao Body. It was also extremely effective at recovering Essence Energy. It also strengthened his body, making it similar to his Dao Body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried to use his Chaos Body to inject Essence Energy into the Invisibility Cloak. The Invisibility Cloak vibrated even more intensely, as though it was about to break out of its shell.</p>
<p>But after a long vibration, it still did not come out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t manage to get the Invisibility Cloak out after all his hard work. He knew that he was still lacking something. He probably needed to wait for the First Order of Chaos to condense a Life Soul before he could hatch it.</p>
<p>It won’t be that easy to condense a Life Soul. These Essence Energy Arts are simulated by the Lost Immortal Sutra, not something I really mastered. Previously, those Life Souls were condensed by absorbing a special attribute. To condense a Life Soul for the First Order of Chaos, I’m afraid I have to do something similar, right?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen secretly calculated in his heart. Previously, the Dao Body absorbed the Taboo attribute and condensed a Life Soul. And the Taboo attribute was because I absorbed the blood of the creature inside the Ant Nest cocoon. Could it be that I can help the First Order of Chaos condense a Life Soul if I obtain another drop of blood?</p>
<p>Due to the similarities between the First Order of Chaos and the Dao Sutra, Zhou Wen felt that it was likely easier for the First Order of Chaos to condense a Life Soul than Small Perfection of Wisdom. After all, he had had similar experiences.</p>
<p>What he lacked now was a drop of blood. This was because Zhou Wen didn’t have the physique needed to cultivate the First Order of Chaos. It was purely simulated by the Lost Immortal Sutra. To condense a Life Soul, he needed a foundation.</p>
<p>Having figured this out, Zhou Wen opened the Ant Nest dungeon and went to Ant City.</p>
<p>He hadn’t gone to Ant Nest for days. Now, he suddenly felt like he was in a dream. It was as if he had just obtained the mysterious phone and the time he had come to grind ants was just yesterday.</p>
<p>However, the ants here were completely unable to harm him. Any Companion Beast beside Zhou Wen could finish them off.</p>
<p>The Fire Furnace Queen threw down a ball of molten flames, burning large swaths of ants to death. The notifications of him killing dimensional creatures flooded the screen.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen, the Golden Flying Ant was something he could kill easily. Six-Winged smacked it to death with a single swipe of its claw, akin to squashing an ant.</p>
<p>Apart from this white cocoon, I’ve seen two. One is protected by a white dragon while the other is protected by the chick’s mother. They are extremely terrifying Mythical creatures. In comparison, the guardian, Golden Flying Ant, is highly lacking in qualifications. Seeing nothing drop from the Golden Flying Ant, Zhou Wen flew straight for the white cocoon.</p>
<p>He summoned the Golden Battle God Halberd. He held the trident in both hands while the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon stood in front to protect him.</p>
<p>The last time Zhou Wen came, he had been killed instantly by the creature inside the white cocoon. Although his strength had improved greatly and he had two authentic Mythical Companion Beasts, he still felt that he was probably no match for the creature inside the cocoon.</p>
<p>Attack! Zhou Wen gripped his trident tightly as he stared intently at the white cocoon.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the command, the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s wings transformed into streams of light and slashed at the white cocoon like six blades.</p>
<p>The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon was still quite powerful. Its dragon wings sliced open the white cocoon, revealing the creature that was curled up inside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate at all. At the instant the white cocoon was torn open, the golden trident stabbed at the creature. He used all his strength. This strike was his fastest attack to date.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen felt that he wasn’t a match for the creature inside the cocoon, it wasn’t difficult to get a drop of blood. After all, he had succeeded before when he was weaker than he was now.</p>
<p>Moreover, he had previously used the golden trident and coupled it with Lost Country’s teleportation to kill Medusa from behind with one strike. This proved the powerful destructive power of the golden trident.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought that if the creature inside the cocoon didn’t defend in time, he might be able to luck out and kill her.</p>
<p>I wonder what will drop if she dies? A thought flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind. It was only an instant.</p>
<p>The Golden Divine Light at the tip of the golden trident was about to stab the creature inside the cocoon, the creature didn’t even raise her head to look at the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart raced. Just as he thought he was about to succeed, the golden trident suddenly stopped. It moved from extreme motion to extreme stillness. It only took an instant.</p>
<p>A snow-white hand grabbed onto the golden trident’s edge. The incomparably sharp edge was unable to slice through the fair and slender fingers.</p>
<p>The creature in the cocoon finally raised its head. It turned its head and looked at the blood-colored avatar with its demonic eyes.</p>
<h3 id='chapter555'>Chapter 555 The Terrifying Guardian</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat as he sensed something amiss. He subconsciously switched to the Inverse Ancient Emperor and used the Demon Dragon True Body. The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon roared and spewed out dragon breath.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar and Six-Winged felt as though they had been struck by lightning. The blood-colored avatar’s hands involuntarily released the Golden Battle God Halberd as his body flew backward. Like a cannonball, they slammed into the mountain wall, producing a large and small hole.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that the blood-colored avatar was seriously injured, but thankfully, it wasn’t dead. This time, it wasn’t instantly killed by the creature inside the cocoon. Just as he was about to leave the cave, he saw a golden beam flash in front of him. The Golden Battle God Halberd flew over and nailed the blood-colored avatar’s body. It penetrated its chest and the game screen instantly turned black.</p>
<p>This fellow is a little too strong. The six-winged seraphim should be much weaker than her, right? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. He only wanted to get a drop of blood, but he still ended up being killed.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen realized something. His encounter with her this time was clearly different from before. Her body seemed to have grown quite a bit.</p>
<p>When he first came, the creature in the cocoon was still sleeping. She only woke up after he had injured her.</p>
<p>This time, it was obvious that she had completely woken up. Her body had also developed more perfectly. Every time he saw her, she was somewhat different. This was clearly different from the other dimensional creatures in-game.</p>
<p>According to The Thearch, the creatures in the cocoons should be the guardians of the various species. Then, can I drip my blood on the cocoon like John? If I can obtain her approval, will she become my guardian? It looks like she’s clearly much stronger than the six-winged seraphim. This thought flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind.</p>
<p>However, it was only for an instant. He had many secrets. He definitely could not let an intelligent being who could betray him follow him around 24/7.</p>
<p>Since I can’t do it by force, I’ll have to sneak an attack. Zhou Wen entered Ant City again, but he had learned his lesson this time. He didn’t directly face the creature inside the cocoon.</p>
<p>First, he used the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon as bait. The blood-colored avatar and Demonic Neonate hid in the ant honey pool, silently waiting for an opportunity.</p>
<p>The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon blasted open the white cocoon. The creature inside the cocoon only took a glance at it before it was sent flying.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the third party, it was even more shocking. The powerful Six-Winged Guardian Dragon was already considered a top-notch Mythical creature, yet its huge body was actually blasted away by her gaze.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Demonic Neonate didn’t sit idle. The blood-colored avatar held the Golden Battle God Halberd and instantly teleported behind the creature inside the cocoon. The tip of the Golden Battle God Halberd was about to touch her back. As long as Zhou Wen thrust it a little further forward, the Golden Divine Light could stab through her skin and cause a drop of blood to drip out.</p>
<p>However, just as Zhou Wen teleported out, he saw the creature turn her head to look at him.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body flew out like a cannonball. Soon, the game screen turned black again.</p>
<p>Is the guardian really only at the Mythical stage? Apart from The Thearch whose strength is unknown, she’s many times stronger than any Mythical creature I’ve ever seen. Zhou Wen felt that this fellow wasn’t as simple as a Mythical creature.</p>
<p>The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon was considered a top-notch Mythical creature. Although it did not have any offensive miracle, it should not have been so easily killed by someone of the same level.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suspected that the guardian could break through the limits of the Mythical stage. If not, it meant that her skills, Life Soul, and other aspects were already heaven-defying.</p>
<p>After dying twice, Zhou Wen didn’t head to Ant City again.</p>
<p>“Thearch, how can the guardian you mentioned last time be contracted?” Zhou Wen sent a probing message to The Thearch.</p>
<p>However, The Thearch didn’t reply. He didn’t know what she was doing. He hadn’t seen her appear recently.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen headed to Ant City again, he needed to think of a perfect solution. Making blind attempts was pointless.</p>
<p>I wonder if the crystal mirror transformed from a Sun Beast can reflect her gaze. Zhou Wen thought as he grinded.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a strange sound entered Zhou Wen’s ears. He turned his head and saw a Companion Egg drop beside the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. It was a Sun Beast Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted as he hurriedly went over to pick up the Companion Egg. After hatching it, he had another Sun Beast Companion Beast. Their stats were about the same.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the crystal mirror was too small. Even with two crystal mirrors, they couldn’t completely block Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>There are two crystal mirrors. I can try fusion. Zhou Wen decided to give it a try. If he could produce a full-body mirror armor, his entire body would be equivalent to a mirror. Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World would naturally be useless to him.</p>
<p>However, the crystal mirror’s compatibility with armor beasts was too low. With a fusion compatibility of about 40%, failure was easy.</p>
<p>Typically, armor is made of metal while the crystal mirror is crystal. Could this be the reason why the compatibility is relatively low? Zhou Wen thought for a moment before heading to the Curse Demon Palace and grinding out a Stone Armor Companion Beast.</p>
<p>He placed them together, and indeed, the compatibility was much higher, reaching 61.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is the case. However, the skills and Life Providence of this Stone Armor are lacking. Most importantly, this isn’t a full-body armor. There’s no way to cover my whole body. Zhou Wen searched online and discovered that there were quite a number of jade-type Companion Beasts that could become full-body armor.</p>
<p>After looking through a lot of information, Zhou Wen decided to buy a jade armor-type Companion Beast to fuse.</p>
<p>He still had a large number of Essence Crystals. It wasn’t difficult to buy an Epic Companion Egg. Zhou Wen decided to head to the Companion Egg shop. Whatever Companion Eggs were online might also be on sale at the local Companion Egg shops.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t go to Qin Xiyuan’s shop. He had a nagging feeling that there was something wrong with Qin Xiyuan. If he could avoid him, he would rather not interact with him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen remembered that his classmate, Luo Xuan, owned a Companion Beast shop. Therefore, he contacted Luo Xuan and asked him about jade armor-type beasts.</p>
<p>Luo Xuan said that his shop should have one, but he still needed to take a look at the specific ones before he could tell him in detail. He told Zhou Wen to visit his shop.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen arrived at Luo Xuan’s pet shop, Luo Xuan rushed back.</p>
<p>“Jade armor-type Companion Beasts are considered quite common. Compared to metal and wood armor, the price of the jade armor is relatively cheap, but not by much. After all, you want an Epic Companion Egg.” Luo Xuan personally led Zhou Wen to his store to see the jade-type Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“Is there jade armor that can wrap the entire body? It’s best if there’s no gap at all.” Zhou Wen asked as he looked around.</p>
<p>“It’s really not easy to find. Jade armor is heavy to begin with. If it’s full-body armor, it’s inconvenient for movement.” Luo Xuan thought for a moment before saying, “However, we do have an Epic Companion Egg like that in our shop, but in terms of price, it might be more expensive than the typical Epic Companion Egg.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter556'>Chapter 556 Killing Torch Dragon</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen left the shop with a crystalline jade-type Companion Egg in his bag.</p>
<p>This Companion Egg was an Epic jade terracotta. It had dropped from an ancient tomb dimensional zone. There were more clay terracotta and bronze terracotta. Jade terracotta was a rare breed.</p>
<p>This type of terracotta had armor as their companion forms. Because jade terracotta was rare, it was much more expensive.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used his phone to look at the stats of the jade terracotta Companion Egg. It was pretty good and could be considered quite a top-notch Epic stage.</p>
<p>Spirit-Protecting Jade Terracotta: Epic</p>
<p>Life Providence: Unaging Undying</p>
<p>Life Soul: Guardian Spirit.</p>
<p>Strength: 39</p>
<p>Speed: 28</p>
<p>Constitution: 40</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 40</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Clear Jade Shield.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Armor</p>
<p>Apart from speed, the Spirit-Protecting Jade Terracotta was top-notch at the Epic stage. However, Zhou Wen only wanted its companion form. Speed didn’t matter.</p>
<p>He had used his phone to match with the Sun Beast. The Spirit-Protecting Jade Terracotta had a compatibility of 91% with the Sun Beast, which was much higher than the Stone Armor.</p>
<p>After returning to his dorm, Zhou Wen couldn’t wait to hatch the Spirit-Protecting Jade Terracotta. Then, he placed it in the same panel with the Sun Beast.</p>
<p>I hope there will be a good outcome. Zhou Wen had spent all his money to buy the Spirit-Protecting Jade Terracotta.</p>
<p>Although he had a lot of Essence Crystals, he could not cash them out. Naturally, he couldn’t use them for direct payment.</p>
<p>Would fusing the armor and mirror together have a perfect ending—a mirror-surfaced armor—like Zhou Wen’s imagination? Zhou Wen didn’t have any confidence. However, he had no choice but to give it a try.</p>
<p>Seeing the two pets emit a resplendent glow and gradually fuse into one, Zhou Wen’s heart leaped to his throat.</p>
<p>The fusion easily succeeded, but success wasn’t the main point. It was very difficult to fail with 91% compatibility. Whether it could become what Zhou Wen needed was the crux.</p>
<p>After a while, Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. Why didn’t the light dissipate? On careful look, it had already been successfully fused. However, the new pet emitted a resplendent glow like the sun, preventing Zhou Wen from seeing it clearly.</p>
<p>After taking a closer look, he realized that the new pet was like a crystal and was emitting a dazzling light. It was still in the form of the jade terracotta.</p>
<p>Please let it be armor… Armor… He was delighted and quickly checked the information about his new pet.</p>
<p>Jade Crystal Spirit: Epic</p>
<p>Life Providence: Unaging Undying</p>
<p>Life Soul: Guardian Spirit.</p>
<p>Strength: 40</p>
<p>Speed: 31</p>
<p>Constitution: 40</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 40</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Jade Crystal Light Shield.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Armor</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he hurriedly summoned the Jade Crystal Spirit in companion form. Soon, a crystal armor appeared around him, enveloping his entire body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at himself in the mirror and nearly jumped up in excitement. The armor on his body was like a crystalline mirror, clearly reflecting everything around him. At a glance, he imagined that his body had vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt as though he had eaten the Fruit of Life. All his pores effused with pleasure. He had never had such a smooth, successful fusion of pets. To Zhou Wen, it was a miracle.</p>
<p>He could not wait to enter the game and go to the temple in the Jade Crystal Spirit armor. He wanted to see if such armor could block the Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>Just like before, Zhou Wen flew behind Torch Dragon and stabbed the Golden Battle God Halberd into its back. Amidst the pain, rows of eyes appeared on both sides of its body. Each eye had the Bright Torch Vision World ability.</p>
<p>Almost instantly, the dragon wings on Zhou Wen’s back and the Golden Battle God Halberd in his hand vanished. They reflected in Torch Dragon’s eyes, but the blood-colored avatar in the Jade Crystal Spirit armor was fine.</p>
<p>It really works! Zhou Wen felt relieved. He knew that he could finally kill Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>As expected, Torch Dragon’s enraged state did not last for long. In just a minute, other than its pair of snake eyes, the rest of its eyes closed.</p>
<p>However, that minute felt like a century to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Without the speed augmentation of the dragon wings, Zhou Wen found it a struggle to dodge using only Transcendent Flying Immortal. He was nearly killed a few times.</p>
<p>Thankfully, with Slaughterer’s infinite Essence Energy supporting him, Zhou Wen maintained his Transcendent Flying Immortal state. At the same time, he used Ghost Steps. Under the high pressure, he fused the two Essence Energy Skills and constantly shuttled through the pillars in the palace. He managed to survive until finally, the eyes on Torch Dragon’s body closed.</p>
<p>After Torch Dragon closed its eyes, its aura weakened greatly. It was as if it had been drained of all energy.</p>
<p>However, without the Golden Battle God Halberd, Zhou Wen couldn’t kill it. In the end, he was still killed by Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t feel depressed about the death. He was calm. He knew that he could finally go to the ruins to kill Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>He dripped another drop of blood to revive and entered the game dungeon. Now, Zhou Wen was especially calm because he knew that Torch Dragon was no longer his obstacle.</p>
<p>He came in front of Torch Dragon once again. The instant the Golden Battle God Halberd stabbed Torch Dragon, Zhou Wen unsummoned it and the dragon wings and rapidly retreated.</p>
<p>As expected, Torch Dragon’s eyes opened all across its body like before.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept using his movement technique to circle around the metal columns. Torch Dragon, who was covered in eyes, chased after him desperately like a lantern.</p>
<p>Seconds passed. After barely holding on for a minute, the eyes on Torch Dragon completely shut. Its body seemed to shrivel as its massive body seemed to shrink.</p>
<p>Now… it’s my turn… Zhou Wen summoned the dragon wings and Golden Battle God Halberd again as his eyes burned.</p>
<p>After working hard for so long, he had finally overcome this seemingly impossible mountain.</p>
<p>As though sensing the change in Zhou Wen’s aura, Torch Dragon shrank back in fear.</p>
<p>“It’s too late to be afraid now.” Zhou Wen flapped the dragon wings on his back and instantly appeared beside Torch Dragon. The Golden Divine Light at the tip of the Golden Battle God Halberd tore through the poison fog around Torch Dragon and stabbed at its body.</p>
<p>Blood splattered as the Golden Divine Light tore through Torch Dragon’s scales and flesh.</p>
<p>Amidst a sharp cry, Torch Dragon spewed out poisonous smoke as black beams shot out from the scales on its body. However, it was already at the end of its rope. Its might was much weaker than before, making it impossible for him to injure Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s figure flashed as the Golden Battle God Halberd constantly tore apart Torch Dragon’s flesh. The palace was filled with dragon blood.</p>
<p>The powerful Torch Dragon finally collapsed at Zhou Wen’s feet. When the gigantic body collapsed, the entire palace seemed to tremble.</p>
<p>Looking at Torch Dragon’s corpse in the pool of blood, Zhou Wen felt an indescribable sense of joy.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>As Torch Dragon’s corpse slowly disappeared, a black crystal dropped.</p>
<h3 id='chapter557'>Chapter 557 The Last Day of the Exchange</h3>
<p>‘Killed Mythical Creature, Torch Dragon youngling. Discovered Dimensional Crystal.’</p>
<p>This thing… is a youngling… Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be astonished. If it were an adult Torch Dragon, he wondered how strong it would be.</p>
<p>Only one dimensional crystal dropped. When Zhou Wen saw the number, he thought it was just an ordinary dimensional crystal. He couldn’t help but feel somewhat disappointed. However, upon careful scrutiny, he saw that it was a 37-valued Spatial dimensional crystal.</p>
<p>It’s a rare spatial stat, and it’s 37 points. Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he hurriedly absorbed the Spatial Crystal.</p>
<p>Strands of strange energy fused into Zhou Wen’s body, making him feel like his body had changed, but he couldn’t tell what changes had happened.</p>
<p>After the Spatial Crystal was completely absorbed, Zhou Wen saw the Spatial state of his rare stats reach 37.</p>
<p>Spatial stat of 37. The requirement for the Jade Lute Crystal is 41 Constitution, 21 Spatial stat, and a Spatial Life Providence and Life Soul. In other words, as long as I raise my Constitution to 41 points, I can absorb the Jade Lute Crystal skill. Zhou Wen was still eyeing the Jade Lute Crystal.</p>
<p>Although no Companion Egg dropped, a special stat was still extremely valuable. Zhou Wen was satisfied and planned on doing it again. Unfortunately, Torch Dragon was the same as the Golden Battle God Halberd. It didn’t appear immediately after he respawned the dungeon. It would probably take 24 hours before the Torch Dragon youngling would appear again.</p>
<p>It’s time to go to Zhuolu. Zhou Wen planned on heading to Zhuolu while waiting for the dungeon to respawn. As long as he grinded twice and confirmed that he could kill Torch Dragon safely, he would immediately enter the ruins.</p>
<p>He could ignore the chick and antelope. If the two of them didn’t see Zhou Wen return, they would definitely head to Wang Lu’s place for free food and drink. They wouldn’t starve themselves.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen planned on purchasing some items before heading to Zhuolu.</p>
<p>Just as he walked out of Four Seasons Garden, he bumped into Ming Xiu and Tian Zhenzhen, who were looking for him.</p>
<p>“Coach, our exchange is about to end. I came to say goodbye before we leave,” Ming Xiu said.</p>
<p>“So fast?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He didn’t think it had been three months since Ming Xiu had arrived. His days of gaming really passed quickly.</p>
<p>“The three months are up the day after tomorrow. I’m afraid that the school will have other arrangements and that I won’t be able to bid you farewell, so I came ahead of time,” Ming Xiu said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what to say. He wasn’t good at words, nor did he like to make farewell speeches.</p>
<p>“Coach, if you have the time, can you fight me again before I leave?” Ming Xiu clearly wasn’t the kind of person who would invite others to a farewell dinner. He wasn’t just here to bid Zhou Wen farewell.</p>
<p>“I can do it now,” Zhou Wen said with a nod.</p>
<p>“Then let’s go to the training ground. I’ve improved a lot recently. Although I haven’t advanced to the Epic stage, I already have some insights,” Ming Xiu said excitedly.</p>
<p>The three of them arrived at the training ground and found an empty room. Tian Zhenzhen stood by the side and watched the battle. Zhou Wen and Ming Xiu took their practice weapons and stood there.</p>
<p>“Coach, please give me your guidance.” With the sword in hand, Ming Xiu’s temperament changed instantly. The warmth from before vanished. His being was even more terrifying and cold than the sword in his hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wielded the practice sword and displayed the stance of Transcendent Flying Immortal. Since Ming Xiu specially came to spar with him before leaving, Zhou Wen didn’t want to brush him off.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu held his sword. At the instant his aura reached its peak, he unsheathed his sword and transformed into a stream of light that stabbed Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>It was like the last ray of light on the horizon during sunset. Ming Xiu’s sword was gorgeous and resolute. It was the last ray of light, and also the final bloom.</p>
<p>Although they were both focused on speed, Ming Xiu’s sword techniques and Feng Qiuyan’s saber techniques exuded a completely different feeling.</p>
<p>Tian Zhenzhen watched Ming Xiu’s strike from the side. Her eyes were filled with anticipation, hoping that the strike would surprise Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>She had been practicing with Ming Xiu the entire time. She knew how much hardship Ming Xiu had suffered in order to hone his sword, and she also knew how much Ming Xiu had improved in such a short time. Although she knew that Ming Xiu couldn’t defeat Zhou Wen, she also wished to see a look of surprise on Zhou Wen’s face. That was the greatest reward for Ming Xiu’s hard work.</p>
<p>Tian Zhenzhen knew very well that Zhou Wen’s shocked expression was more important than any other person’s praise for Ming Xiu.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t show any expression. With a slight movement of his practice sword, he blocked Ming Xiu’s sword. Although Ming Xiu’s sword was fast and ruthless, it was still too slow for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu couldn’t help but feel a little discouraged when he saw Zhou Wen easily block his sword that was infused with everything. He stood there with his sword in hand.</p>
<p>“What are you waiting for? Continue,” Zhou Wen said when he saw Ming Xiu pause.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu’s eyes narrowed. He gripped the sword in his hand tightly and swung it again. Like before, his sword was as fast as lightning.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen still casually brandished his sword and blocked Ming Xiu’s sword. However, this time, Ming Xiu didn’t hesitate or stop as he struck again.</p>
<p>Tian Zhenzhen was filled with disappointment. Ming Xiu had clearly put in so much effort, but Zhou Wen was still able to easily block his sword art.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu constantly attacked Zhou Wen from all directions. His sword technique was like meteors that streaked across the sky, but Zhou Wen didn’t use his strongest strike. He even remained in place. All he did was wave his sword and block Ming Xiu’s incoming strikes.</p>
<p>Tian Zhenzhen could not help but smile bitterly. She knew that the difference between the two of them was too great. It was so great that it left one in despair.</p>
<p>Looking at Ming Xiu, who constantly attacked Zhou Wen but failed to make him even take a single step, Tian Zhenzhen felt her heart almost shatter. She really didn’t wish to see Ming Xiu suffer such a blow.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu had put so much effort into improving his sword techniques that when they failed she wanted to rush forward and stop him from continuing the battle. She didn’t want Ming Xiu to suffer such humiliation again.</p>
<p>“If I were you, I wouldn’t disturb him.” A voice sounded beside her. Tian Zhenzhen was too engrossed and hadn’t noticed someone standing beside her.</p>
<p>“President Wei?” Tian Zhenzhen turned around and realized that the person was the president of the student council, Wei Ge.</p>
<p>Wei Ge looked at the battle between Zhou Wen and Ming Xiu and said, “No one is born to be a winner. Every man will experience countless failures in his life. However, some men will never get up again after failing. As for some men, they will get up and continue advancing after failing, ultimately becoming geniuses in the eyes of others. Trust him. Don’t stand in front of him. Don’t block his path. Just trust him.”</p>
<p>Tian Zhenzhen didn’t understand him, but his words dispelled her urge to rush over.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu’s sword constantly slashed out, but it was also constantly blocked by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Wei Ge’s eyes narrowed. He could tell that Ming Xiu’s sword technique was evolving. He was searching for all possibilities. As long as he could get up and continue advancing, he would not lose.</p>
<h3 id='chapter558'>Chapter 558 Tomorrow Sword Ar</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen’s sword art looked ordinary, but he had already used Transcendent Flying Immortal’s technique. However, he didn’t take the initiative to attack and only used it to defend. No one could tell what was so profound about it.</p>
<p>However, even defense alone gave Ming Xiu a lot of pressure. Just like when Zhou Wen and Xia Xuanyue fought, Xia Xuanyue used the Path to Snatching Heaven to pressure Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s movement technique wasn’t the Path to Snatching Heaven. It wasn’t that aggressive. He was only defending, but it made Ming Xiu feel as if he would be killed by Zhou Wen if he didn’t attack.</p>
<p>Therefore, Ming Xiu could only continuously attack and attack. If it was an ordinary person, under such pressure, they would probably be scared out of their wits. Their willpower would soon collapse, and they would give up on resisting or end up risking their lives.</p>
<p>However, Ming Xiu didn’t give up. Under such pressure, he constantly searched for an opportunity to defeat Zhou Wen. He constantly attacked with his sword.</p>
<p>This won’t do… Not this either… Ming Xiu kept trying, but no matter how fast his sword was, no matter how gorgeous his technique was, or how brilliant his strikes were, they were perfectly parried by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>What do I have to do to break through the Coach’s defense? Ming Xiu had already tried his best. He had already tried everything he could, but he couldn’t think of any better methods.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu knew that this couldn’t continue. Once his train of thought was severed, his sword’s might would weaken. When that happened, Zhou Wen would counterattack.</p>
<p>This was his last battle with Zhou Wen before he left. He didn’t wish to leave it just like that.</p>
<p>What should I do… what should I do… Countless thoughts flashed across Ming Xiu’s mind.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu suddenly felt that this situation was a little familiar. He seemed to have experienced this before.</p>
<p>Soon, Ming Xiu remembered why this situation was so familiar. It was because he had faced the same predicament when he was young.</p>
<p>At that time, he had only been practicing his sword techniques for a short period of time. He was small and weak in strength—he was only three years old. The other students who practiced with him were already six or seven years old. Therefore, during any sparring, the difference in strength was huge and Ming Xiu was always defeated by his classmates because he was too weak.</p>
<p>He lost terribly in the daily sparrings. With Ming Xiu’s temper, he naturally couldn’t accept it. At that time, he often thought that if he could grow up faster and become as strong as his classmates, he would definitely not lose.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was impossible for him to grow up overnight. However, ever since then, Ming Xiu constantly upped the ante when it came to training. He kept honing his skills. Although he was very young, after a few months he was able to fight against his classmates who were a few years older than him. A year later, no classmate was his match.</p>
<p>The predicament back then was the same as the present predicament. Zhou Wen was much stronger than him in every aspect. The difference was that even with technique, he still couldn’t beat Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>When I was young, I couldn’t fulfill that fantasy. But now, it’s not impossible to realize it. I can do it in another way… Ming Xiu seemed to have made a decision in his heart, and his gaze became sharper.</p>
<p>“His gaze is different,” Wei Ge said with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>“What do you mean his gaze is different?” Tian Zhenzhen asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>“Watch his next move. Perhaps this will be a very important moment in his life,” Wei Ge said without elaboration.</p>
<p>Tian Zhenzhen had no choice but to stare at Ming Xiu. She wanted to know how different his next strike would be.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu held his sword as sword beams flashed like meteors. From Tian Zhenzhen’s point of view, this strike was no different from many of his previous strikes. They were all so fast and furious, but such strikes couldn’t defeat Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>She had already seen it countless times. Such a magnificent sword art had been easily blocked by Zhou Wen. There had been no exception.</p>
<p>Indeed, Zhou Wen’s sword blocked Ming Xiu’s sword again, but at the instant the two swords clashed, everyone was astonished to realize that Zhou Wen’s sword had missed. It failed to block Ming Xiu’s sword.</p>
<p>As for Ming Xiu’s sword, it acted as a late student. After Zhou Wen’s sword swept over, his sword stabbed towards Zhou Wen’s heart.</p>
<p>“Alright! Zhou Wen made a mistake!” Tian Zhenzhen jumped up in excitement. She thought that it was Zhou Wen’s mistake.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>However, in the next second, Zhou Wen’s sword hilt slumped downwards and struck Ming Xiu’s sword tip. It sent Ming Xiu’s sword to the side, preventing him from stabbing him.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t Zhou Wen’s mistake, but a result of Ming Xiu’s deliberate actions. The late sword wasn’t even seen by Zhou Wen. It nearly hit him. It’s really interesting.” Wei Ge revealed a teasing expression.</p>
<p>Ming Xiu had already ceased his attack. He did not continue fighting and sheathed his sword.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s sword-wielding hand drooped down as he allowed the tip of the sword to stick to the ground.</p>
<p>“Nice sword art. What’s the name of that strike?” Zhou Wen asked Ming Xiu.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t have a name yet. Coach, if you don’t mind, you can give it a name,” Ming Xiu said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t decline. After some thought, he said, “Since it’s a late strike, let’s call it Tomorrow Sword Art.”</p>
<p>“Sword of Tomorrow… Tomorrow Sword Art… Alright… I’ll call it Tomorrow Sword Art…” Ming Xiu seemed to like this name very much and decided to go with it.</p>
<p>“Then, let me see how far your Tomorrow Sword Art can go.” Zhou Wen narrowed his eyes as he stared at the sword in Ming Xiu’s hand. He felt his confidence and inspiration erupt due to Ming Xiu’s strike. His mind was at peak activity.</p>
<p>“Coach, please appraise my Tomorrow Sword Art!” Ming Xiu gripped the hilt of his sword. It was as if he had entered a mysterious realm that was surreal.</p>
<p>Ka-Cha!</p>
<p>The practice sword and scabbard in Ming Xiu’s hand actually broke apart. Cracks spread out on the scabbard. In the blink of an eye, the scabbard shattered, along with the sword hilt that Ming Xiu was holding.</p>
<p>It was not strange that the practice sword shattered. The strange thing was that after the practice sword and scabbard crumbled, he still held a sword in his hand. It was a transparent sword of light, and a terrifying sword intent radiated from it.</p>
<p>“Life Soul… Is that a Life Soul?” Tian Zhenzhen could not believe her judgment and asked Wei Ge.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s a Life Soul. It’s really enviable. He’s still so young, but he has already comprehended a Life Soul,” said Wei Ge. He was truly envious.</p>
<p>If he had met Zhou Wen earlier and come to a realization earlier, he wouldn’t have wasted so much time doing other meaningless things. Perhaps he could have been like Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu, with such shocking achievements at a young age.</p>
<h3 id='chapter559'>Chapter 559 Peerless Duo</h3>
<p>When the terrifying sword intent reached its peak, it suddenly retracted. In an instant, it completely converged, and the transparent sword beam in Ming Xiu’s hand stabbed out.</p>
<p>This wasn’t a late strike, but a strike from the future. Ming Xiu’s sword was unbelievably fast as though it had broken through his limits. It transcended space and time as it stabbed at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The eruption of this strike was so sudden, fast, and bizarre that Tian Zhenzhen was unable to keep up with it. She did not even see how the strike was thrust out when she heard a clang.</p>
<p>The practice sword in Zhou Wen’s hand had already snapped. As for the transparent beam sword in Ming Xiu’s hand, it had been sheathed at some point in time.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow after tomorrow. How many tomorrows would there be? If you have the will, why wait until tomorrow? Live in the moment, and let the Sword of Tomorrow slay all grudges. Good sword technique!” Wei Ge praised.</p>
<p>Tian Zhenzhen only knew that Ming Xiu’s strike was very powerful, but she did not know how strong it was or which aspect of it was strong. She kept staring, but she couldn’t tell.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your guidance, Coach. I’ll be leaving.” Ming Xiu bowed seriously and then turned to leave the practice room.</p>
<p>“Ming Xiu, you have finally won. Furthermore, you have condensed a Life Soul. You are only seventeen years old. It’s great that you reached the Epic stage at seventeen,” Tian Zhenzhen chased after him and said excitedly.</p>
<p>“No, I lost.” Ming Xiu shook his head.</p>
<p>“How can that be? I saw you snap Zhou Wen’s sword. You definitely won!” Tian Zhenzhen exclaimed.</p>
<p>“That’s because Coach used a practice sword, while mine was a Life Soul Sword. That’s why he blocked my sword. It was only because the practice sword was too weak that it snapped. Even so, my sword still failed to injure him, nor was it able to force him to attack. Indeed, I’m still too inferior. However, I now have a direction. There will come a day when I will catch up with Coach,” Ming Xiu said confidently.</p>
<p>“I see. However, you are already very powerful. You are at the Epic stage at 17 years old. If your father knew, he would definitely be overjoyed,” Tian Zhenzhen consoled.</p>
<p>“That’s right. It’s time to go back and make the old man happy. I have to let others decide if the sword art my father passed down is weak or strong.” Ming Xiu’s eyes were filled with excitement. After all, he was only a seventeen-year-old. He had the zeal of youth.</p>
<p>After Ming Xiu and Tian Zhenzhen left, Zhou Wen was about to leave when Wei Ge stopped him.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, can we have a chat?” Wei Ge asked.</p>
<p>“President, what’s the matter?” Zhou Wen didn’t feel anything special about Wei Ge. He didn’t have any negative feelings towards him or a good impression of him. He was just a schoolmate he wasn’t familiar with.</p>
<p>“I have a question for you,” Wei Ge said.</p>
<p>“Just say whatever you have to say. However, I might not necessarily answer you,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Wei Ge smiled and said, “Actually, it’s not a big deal. I just want to ask you. After graduating, do you plan on staying in school or going out to make a name of yourself?”</p>
<p>“Everyone’s choices are different. I only wish to return to my hometown to game,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>When Wei Ge heard Zhou Wen’s answer, he was stunned for a long while before he suddenly laughed. “Not bad, not bad. Everyone’s choices are different. I was overthinking it.”</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, what game are you playing? I should have a lot of free time in the future. I want to play it too,” Wei Ge asked.</p>
<p>“Recently, Huang Ji and I have worked together to develop a new game. If you’re interested, you can download it to play. This is the download address.” Zhou Wen sent the download address of the game, Dimensional, to Wei Ge.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll go back and play.” Wei Ge downloaded the game and waved goodbye to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen went to the supermarket to buy what he needed before storing them in the chaos space. Then, he informed Li Xuan and company before leaving the school. He headed to Zhuolu alone.</p>
<p>He didn’t contact An Sheng. Firstly, An Sheng was still hatching the Companion Egg. Secondly, if he contacted An Sheng, he would definitely enter the temple with him. It would be a meaningless risk.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen already had the confidence to kill Torch Dragon, so it was better for him to do it himself.</p>
<p>Before he left the city, his phone suddenly rang. He took a look at the number and realized that it was from Ouyang Lan. He could not help but mutter inwardly, Don’t tell me Ouyang Lan found out so quickly?</p>
<p>“Little Wen, how’s your exchange with your schoolmates at the moment?” Ouyang Lan asked out of the blue after he picked up the call.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen was puzzled and didn’t understand what Ouyang Lan was getting at.</p>
<p>“I’m talking about the exchange student from Bright Prospects College. Aren’t you his student tutor? How are you two getting along? Are you close?” Ouyang Lan asked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was even more puzzled. Why would Ouyang Lan actually care about this?</p>
<p>He had no idea that Ouyang Lan had arranged for him to become Ming Xiu’s student tutor.</p>
<p>“Our relationship isn’t bad, I suppose?” Zhou Wen felt that their relationship wasn’t bad. At the very least, they hadn’t quarreled.</p>
<p>“That’s good. What do you think if I let you live with Ming Xiu in the future?” Ouyang Lan asked again.</p>
<p>“Wait, Sis Lan, what do you mean? What do you mean by letting me live with Ming Xiu?” Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan said, “Do you know what Ming Xiu’s Life Providence is?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Zhou Wen had never cared about this.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that you have a good relationship with him? Why don’t you even know about his Life Providence?” Ouyang Lan didn’t wait for Zhou Wen to reply before continuing, “His Life Providence is Peerless Duo. Do you know what it means? It means that there will be two peerless geniuses in the same era.”</p>
<p>“And then?” Zhou Wen still didn’t understand what this had to do with him.</p>
<p>“Little Wen, I think that you should read more brain-teasers in addition to your cultivation to strengthen your imagination. That’s a Peerless Duo. Of course, it requires two people to be able to be called a duo. In other words, those who practice with him will be augmented by his Life Providence. Both parties will have their cultivation speed accelerate. Don’t you think that you’ve improved faster in the past three months?” Ouyang Lan said.</p>
<p>“There’s actually such a thing…” Zhou Wen really wasn’t aware. Furthermore, he had never cultivated with Ming Xiu. Instead, it was Feng Qiuyan who practiced with Ming Xiu all day.</p>
<p>“Forget it, forget it. Your emotional quotient and reaction are too slow. My relationship with Ming Xiu’s family elders isn’t bad, so if you can get along well, I can consider letting you live together and cultivate together…”</p>
<p>“Sis Lan… Thank you for your kindness… There’s really no need. I’m more used to living alone…” Zhou Wen finally understood why Wang Fei said that the school had designated him as a student tutor and that he couldn’t reject it. So it was Ouyang Lan’s arrangement.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he had missed Ouyang Lan’s good intentions.</p>
<h3 id='chapter560'>Chapter 560 Unexpected Discovery</h3>
<p>After hanging up, Zhou Wen left Luoyang and rode a Chi towards Zhuolu.</p>
<p>He had been to Zhuolu before, so naturally, he still remembered the way. However, compared to the last trip, the probability of seeing people outside the city was lower.</p>
<p>Many of the roads were already abandoned and lush vegetation could be seen everywhere.</p>
<p>Unless there was a large convoy or a pet transport team passing by, it would be hard to see a lone traveler.</p>
<p>On the way, Zhou Wen encountered some break-out creatures. Although they weren’t very strong—at the Legendary stage—it made him even more uneasy.</p>
<p>As the level for break-out creatures dropped, it was very likely that the dimensional zones’ seals would weaken further. Wang Mingyuan had said that in another ten years, the dimensional zones would completely have their seals released. From the looks of it, it wasn’t a lie.</p>
<p>The Chi’s speed was rather fast. Although it wasn’t as comfortable as sitting in a car, it could traverse complicated terrain, unlike cars that were easily restricted.</p>
<p>Many roads were destroyed by dimensional creatures. It was getting harder and harder to drive outside the city.</p>
<p>There were also many vines and plants that covered the roads. Other than some roads that often had cars drive through them, it was hard to guarantee smooth-flowing roads.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of exhaustion as he traveled day and night. On the third day, he set up a tent and planned on sleeping for a while.</p>
<p>Although he was full of energy and had endless Essence Energy, a person’s body and mind wouldn’t feel good if they did not sleep for prolonged periods.</p>
<p>The path Zhou Wen took wasn’t one visited by convoys, so there weren’t many people around. Furthermore, this was a mountain path in the mountainous area, so the chances of encountering people were even lower.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen set up a tent on a platform by the side of the road. It just so happened that the area was empty. Beside it was a cliff without any obstructions. If any foreign creature appeared, it could be discovered ahead of time.</p>
<p>He summoned Six-Winged, Banana Fairy, Doctor Darkness, and other Companion Beasts and got them to guard him. Only then did Zhou Wen feel at ease to fall asleep.</p>
<p>At midnight, Zhou Wen was sleeping soundly when he was suddenly awoken by a pair of tiny hands.</p>
<p>Opening her eyes, he saw Banana Fairy patting his face with her tiny hands. Upon seeing Zhou Wen wake up, Banana Fairy pulled his hand and pointed outside the tent.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Zhou Wen asked Banana Fairy.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy spoke, but he couldn’t understand what she was saying. It left Zhou Wen somewhat depressed. After all, she was a Mythical pet. It had been so long, yet she couldn’t even learn simple human language.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only get up and leave the tent. Six-Winged was sleeping outside the tent, sleeping even more soundly than Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness stood at the entrance of the tent without any expression, as though he was in a daze.</p>
<p>These two fellows aren’t reliable when compared to Banana Fairy, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy flew in the air with her banana leaf and pointed at the bottom of the cliff. She made a series of sounds as though she wanted to tell Zhou Wen something.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked to the edge of the cliff and looked down. With the help of the moonlight’s illumination, he saw something glowing in the forest below.</p>
<p>The flickering light looked very regular. It didn’t look like fireflies. Firstly, fireflies weren’t that bright. Secondly, Zhou Wen had never heard of a firefly being able to emit red light.</p>
<p>Looking at it from above, it felt like a red alert alarm was flashing under it.</p>
<p>What’s down there? A dimensional creature? Although Zhou Wen’s eyesight was good, he couldn’t see what was glowing red from so far away.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy pulled Zhou Wen and flew down as though she wanted him to follow her down.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly pulled Banana Fairy. The world was too terrifying. Many unknown things could cause people to die without knowing why. It wasn’t that Zhou Wen wasn’t curious, but he couldn’t risk his life out of curiosity.</p>
<p>After grabbing Banana Fairy, Zhou Wen summoned more than ten Poison Bats and made them fly down to take a look.</p>
<p>The dozen or so poison bats quickly flew to the forest below the cliff and tore apart the trees and vines, making the red light even clearer.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen switched to Eight Perfections Wisdom and enhanced his vision. He could vaguely see that there seemed to be a red object glowing underground. As it was buried in the soil, only a tiny portion of it could be seen. Zhou Wen couldn’t tell what it was.</p>
<p>He ordered the Poison Bats to dig up the soil near that object. They lay on the ground, their claws piercing into the soil covered by fallen leaves as they dug up the soil.</p>
<p>Seeing that the object didn’t have any reaction, Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief. However, he didn’t dare to be careless. He kept staring at the object and the Poison Bats. Once the Poison Bats had any abnormal reaction, he could immediately react.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the situation that Zhou Wen had expected didn’t happen. After digging for a short while, the Poison Bats had dug out a huge hole.</p>
<p>However, from above, he could only see a red ball that was more than four meters in diameter. It was shining brightly, but he could not tell what it was.</p>
<p>Before confirming what it was, Zhou Wen didn’t dare let the Poison Bat touch it. After some thought, he put away the tent and other things. Then, he got Six-Winged to fly down the cliff with him.</p>
<p>Looking from the side, it was really a huge ball. It looked like a piece of jade that was half-buried in the soil. The blinking light in it was constantly changing, sometimes strong, sometimes weak. That was why from afar, it looked like it was flickering. In fact, it was constantly glowing.</p>
<p>A dimensional creature? It doesn’t look like it. A Companion Egg doesn’t seem like it either. What is it? Zhou Wen sized it up but couldn’t tell what it was.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy couldn’t help but fly above the red ball. Then, she jumped down from the banana leaf and landed on the red ball.</p>
<p>She jumped on the red ball a few times, then with a pop, the red ball cracked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen jumped in fright. It was already too late to stop her. Thankfully, there wasn’t any danger after the red ball split open. The red ball turned into a flower.</p>
<p>The jade-like outer shell was actually its petals. After peeling open layer by layer, the pink pistil inside was revealed, and the glowing object was the pistil.</p>
<p>The moment the flower bloomed, Zhou Wen immediately smelled a rich floral fragrance. With the augmentation of the Eight Perfections Wisdom, he felt that the fragrance was refreshing, one that relaxed his mind.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy had already landed in the pistil. Her tiny hand grabbed some pollen and placed it in her mouth, as though she was eating cotton candy. She quickly swallowed it.</p>
<p>There was a lot of pollen in the flower. After Banana Fairy ate one blob, she grabbed another with both hands. She stuffed it into her mouth and stuffed her cheeks.</p>
<h3 id='chapter561'>Chapter 561 Competition for the Pollen</h3>
<p>A plant-type dimensional creature? Zhou Wen noticed that the flower didn’t show any abnormal reaction. It didn’t react to anything the Banana Fairy did. He found the plant-type dimensional creature rather strange.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw Banana Fairy enjoying the pollen, he wondered if he should get some flower pollen to give it a try, but that was when he suddenly heard a strange sound nearby.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked around and his expression changed slightly. He saw that in the nearby forest, snakes, insects, rats, and ants were all approaching.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen recognized rats, caterpillars, venomous snakes, and centipedes. However, there were many insects that he didn’t know at all.</p>
<p>These weren’t likely to be real dimensional creatures. Most of them were ordinary creatures in the forest. Some of them were mutated creatures, but they were still a little far from the level of dimensional creatures. They could only be considered mortal.</p>
<p>The snakes, insects, rats, and ants struggled to crawl over. They all rushed towards the huge red flower. As they stepped over each other, many of them either got injured or died.</p>
<p>However, they still charged at the red flower as if they were possessed.</p>
<p>Is it the fragrance of the red flower that attracted them? Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Many insects flew over, but before they could reach the red flower, even more terrifying creatures appeared. They scared the snakes, insects, rats, and ants away. However, the former were unwilling to leave. They loitered around the area.</p>
<p>A caterpillar coruscating with blue light crawled out of the forest. When the ants saw it, they immediately hid far away. They would rather squeeze together and trample on each other than get near it.</p>
<p>Even the temptation of the floral fragrance didn’t stop them from fearing the blue-light-emitting caterpillar.</p>
<p>Another break-out creature. Is there a dimensional zone nearby? When Zhou Wen looked up, he realized that another dimensional creature had appeared. It was a butterfly that was as large as a crane. Its body and wings were golden in color. As it flew, it scattered golden specks of light and dust. It was rather eye-catching in the dark night as though it was dancing in a golden galaxy.</p>
<p>However, when the golden dust landed on the snakes, insects, rats, and ants, they all died immediately. Their bodies also turned a faint golden color.</p>
<p>Both the blue-light-emitting caterpillar and the gold-dust butterfly rushed toward the red flower. Clearly, their target was the same.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy, who was enjoying the pollen, saw the gold-dust butterfly and blue-light-emitting caterpillar rushing over. She reached out and grabbed her banana leaf before fanning at them.</p>
<p>The terrifying Grand Yin Wind immediately sent the two flying. However, they remained uninjured, so they quickly rushed over again.</p>
<p>The gold-dust butterfly swooped down at the red flower from the sky. The gold-dust on its body constantly scattered. Unfortunately, it met Banana Fairy and with a wave of her hand, the gold-dust along with the butterfly was sent flying.</p>
<p>Wherever the blue-light-emitting caterpillar crawled, the leaves and soil burned, leaving a blue trail on the ground. However, the blue mark did not seem like a real flame.</p>
<p>However, it shared the same outcome. Before it even approached the red flower, it was blown away by Banana Fairy.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy’s Grand Yin Wind was extremely powerful. The two dimensional creatures were sent flying, but didn’t suffer any serious injuries. They quickly crawled back, shocking Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy stuffed flower pollen into her mouth as she waved the banana leaf at the two of them. She didn’t allow them to approach the red flower. Clearly, she was afraid that they would snatch the flower pollen from her.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw that the blue-light-emitting caterpillar and the gold-dust butterfly weren’t a threat to Banana Fairy, he didn’t take action and just watched from the side.</p>
<p>Apart from those two dimensional creatures, no other dimensional creatures appeared. Instead, it was the ordinary snakes, bugs, rats, and ants. No one was willing to leave, but they didn’t dare approach. They just watched helplessly from the side.</p>
<p>The butterfly and the caterpillar tried to charge forward many times, but they were blown back by the Grand Yin Wind. However, they still did not give up and continued charging forward.</p>
<p>It seemed a little boring. After a while, Zhou Wen yawned, feeling a little sleepy.</p>
<p>Just as he was thinking about whether he should go back and take a nap, he suddenly felt that something was amiss. Sweeping his gaze over, he saw that many of the snakes, insects, rats, and ants were lying there motionless as if they were dead.</p>
<p>The insects that were flying in the air also staggered and fell from the sky.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a careful look and realized that they weren’t really dead. They were just asleep.</p>
<p>Something’s wrong… Could it be the floral fragrance… Zhou Wen immediately realized the problem.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly stopped breathing. Indeed, he felt much less sleepy.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, there is poison in the floral fragrance. Thankfully, my Poison stat is high enough, so I didn’t fall asleep like those snakes, insects, rats, and ants. Zhou Wen saw that Banana Fairy, the butterfly, and the caterpillar weren’t affected by the floral fragrance and were still warring for the flower pollen.</p>
<p>The ordinary creatures around them had all fallen to the ground and were asleep.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of the floral fragrance, he felt bored. He drew his saber and slashed at the blue-light-emitting caterpillar and the gold-dust butterfly, killing them.</p>
<p>The gold-dust butterfly didn’t leave anything behind, but the blue-light-emitting caterpillar rolled out a sapphire-like bead. It was a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>I never expected my luck to be so good. Zhou Wen took out his phone and snapped at the blue-light-emitting caterpillar’s Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Netherworld Caterpillar: Epic</p>
<p>Life Providence: Netherworld Envoy</p>
<p>Life Soul: Netherworld Poison</p>
<p>Strength: 26</p>
<p>Speed: 28</p>
<p>Constitution: 27</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 40</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Myriad Poisons Augmentation</p>
<p>Companion Form: Pill</p>
<p>These stats are rather interesting. Zhou Wen looked at its stats. It was an Epic creature with three attributes that didn’t reach 30 points, but its Essence Energy stat was maxed out.</p>
<p>Furthermore, its companion form was something he had never seen before. After some thought, Zhou Wen picked up the Companion Egg and hatched it before turning it into its companion form.</p>
<p>Soon, a blue lotus seed-like pill appeared in Zhou Wen’s hand. It looked like a blue medicine pill. It looked beautiful, but Zhou Wen didn’t know what effects it would have if he ate it.</p>
<p>What’s the use of this thing? I wonder if I can feed it to other dimensional creatures and poison them to death? Zhou Wen stored away the pill and planned on giving it a try when he had the chance.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy was about to finish all the flower pollen. Her stomach swelled. However, she didn’t have any intention of stopping. She only stopped when she had finished all the flower pollen and then she returned to Zhou Wen’s side.</p>
<p>The next morning at dawn, the morning sun shone on the red flower. The flower instantly withered at a speed visible to the naked eye. It didn’t take long before it turned into ashes on the ground and was gone, leaving behind a red crystal.</p>
<h3 id='chapter562'>Chapter 562 Entering the Underground Ruins Again</h3>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could see what the red crystal was, Banana Fairy had already flown over. She blew a breath and sent the red crystal flying into her mouth.</p>
<p>The red crystal melted in her mouth and was swallowed by Banana Fairy. She licked her lips as if she hadn’t had enough.</p>
<p>It was only at this moment that those sleeping snakes, insects, rats, and ants woke up. They scattered and returned to the forest.</p>
<p>Seeing that there was nothing else there, Zhou Wen continued on his journey and headed straight for Zhuolu.</p>
<p>It had only been a few months, and this road was very different from the last time he took it. Previously, he had not seen so many break-out creatures on the way, but he could see them now.</p>
<p>Although they were low-level dimensional creatures, it also indicated that the dimensional zones’ sealing powers were rapidly weakening.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen arrived at Zhuolu again, he didn’t head to the encampment. He headed straight for the battlefield and circled around the soldiers stationed there before arriving at the entrance of the ruins.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t see the chariot at the entrance of the underground ruins. For some reason, there was a chariot in reality, but there wasn’t a chariot in-game.</p>
<p>After grinding so many Zhuolu instance dungeons, Zhou Wen still couldn’t find the chariot.</p>
<p>He entered the underground ruins which he was extremely familiar with. After passing through the maze-like underground passageway, he went to the Longevity Tree.</p>
<p>There was no Longevity Tree in-game either, but the Longevity Tree in reality was still fine. The fruits on the tree were as many as Zhou Wen had seen before. No one had touched it.</p>
<p>He aimed his phone at them, but there was still no reaction. He knew that it was impossible to store the Longevity Tree on his phone.</p>
<p>This Longevity Tree is so similar to the Dead Man Tree, but it can’t be shown in-game. I wonder what its origins are. Zhou Wen looked at the fruits. Although he knew that eating them would give him immense strength, he wasn’t willing to try.</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol’s fate made it evident. There were definitely unseen consequences of eating it.</p>
<p>Since he couldn’t store away the Longevity Tree, Zhou Wen was preparing to leave when he suddenly felt a burning sensation on his tattoo. Demonic Neonate was throbbing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he summoned Demonic Neonate. The moment Demonic Neonate landed, she ran towards the Longevity Tree. Before Zhou Wen could call out to her, she had already jumped onto it and opened her mouth to bite the fruit.</p>
<p>Ka-cha! Ka-cha!</p>
<p>One fruit was swallowed by Demonic Neonate in a few seconds. She continued to bite at another fruit.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was surprised. Ever since Demonic Neonate had been born, she hadn’t eaten or drunk. Even when Zhou Wen fed her the best Epic Companion Egg, she wasn’t moved. She even showed disdain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that she didn’t eat at all, but who knew that she would eat the fruits of the Longevity Tree? In just moments, she had swallowed three to four fruits.</p>
<p>Back then, Lord Alcohol only ate one fruit and his body was restored to its youth. He almost broke through to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate had eaten three or four fruits, but she still looked fine. She continued crawling around the tree, looking for fruits to eat.</p>
<p>The Longevity Tree was likely a terrifying Mythical creature. It easily turned Lord Alcohol into fertilizer. Demonic Neonate jumped around its body and ate many fruits, but the Longevity Tree didn’t react at all.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared at the Longevity Tree for a long time as he thought to himself, Could this tree be waiting for Demonic Neonate to finish eating before dealing with her?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood far away and focused. If the Longevity Tree stirred, he would immediately summon Demonic Neonate back and escape.</p>
<p>It was a strange object, and it wasn’t in-game. Zhou Wen didn’t wish to take the risk to fight it.</p>
<p>However, nothing Zhou Wen imagined happened. Demonic Neonate jumped around on the tree and ate many Longevity Fruits, but the tree didn’t react at all.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate finished more than ten Longevity Fruits and was about to eat more, but she suddenly fell from the tree, giving Zhou Wen a fright.</p>
<p>He immediately summoned her back. Demonic Neonate transformed into a stream of light and returned to Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen felt that Demonic Neonate’s tattoo was burning hot, like a piece of burning iron. It was so hot that Zhou Wen nearly cried out. All he could do was summon her out again.</p>
<p>When Demonic Neonate landed in front of Zhou Wen, the Longevity Tree in the distance didn’t move. It made Zhou Wen heave a sigh of relief as he hurriedly checked Demonic Neonate’s body.</p>
<p>Her face was flushed red, and there was even a hint of white air coming out of her body. It was like steam.</p>
<p>However, Demonic Neonate’s aura was completely uniform, and she didn’t appear to have a problem. Instead, her vital energy was constantly surging, as if she was about to advance.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me she’s about to advance to the Legendary stage? Zhou Wen felt that there was a high chance that he was right. However, he didn’t know what changes would happen if this happened.</p>
<p>She already had a Life Providence, Life Soul, and Wheel of Destiny. If she advanced to the Legendary stage, he didn’t know if she would condense a new Life Providence.</p>
<p>The white gas on Demonic Neonate increased in amount as it enveloped her body. Her temperature was shockingly high, so Zhou Wen could only watch from the side. He could do nothing.</p>
<p>If those Longevity Fruits really can make Demonic Neonate evolve, why don’t I pluck them and keep them for her? Zhou Wen looked at the Longevity Tree as many thoughts flashed through his mind.</p>
<p>It was impossible for him to eat them himself, so in the past he had had no intention of doing anything to the Longevity Tree. However, since Demonic Neonate was willing to eat the fruits, he couldn’t just sit around and do nothing.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen summoned a Poison Bat, hoping to see if it could pluck the Longevity Fruit.</p>
<p>The Poison Bat flapped its wings and flew over. Before it could pluck the fruit, a tree root emerged from the ground. It wrapped around the Poison Bat’s body like a flood dragon and pulled it into the ground. Then, nothing else happened.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, not anyone can pluck the fruits. Zhou Wen summoned some of his other Companion Beasts, but the outcome was the same. They were killed by the Longevity Tree the moment they approached. They couldn’t even touch the tree, much less the Longevity Fruit.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wish to touch the Longevity Fruit himself, nor did he wish to take the risk with a Mythical pet. All he could do was wait for Demonic Neonate to complete her evolution. If there was nothing he could do, he would get Demonic Neonate to pluck the fruit herself and take everything away. It would be her food for the future.</p>
<p>After a while, the white gas on Demonic Neonate’s body gradually dissipated, and her body temperature also gradually decreased. However, it didn’t seem like her body had undergone any special changes. She was still tiny, and she was still hugging the ancient sword in her arms.</p>
<p>After Demonic Neonate had fully recovered, she stood up and looked in the direction of the Longevity Tree. However, she seemed to hesitate and did not go over immediately.</p>
<p>“If you can’t eat anymore, why don’t you pluck the fruits now and I’ll help you keep them?” Zhou Wen suggested.</p>
<h3 id='chapter563'>Chapter 563 Take Everything Away</h3>
<p>Demonic Neonate thought about it for a moment before finding it feasible and nodding.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted as he hurriedly took out a huge cloth bag from his chaos space and handed it to Demonic Neonate. He patted her head and said, “Try your best to pick more fruits. I’ll store them for you. You can eat them anytime in the future.”</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate was too short, so she had to drag the cloth bag to the Longevity Tree. Zhou Wen held the Bamboo Blade and stared at the Longevity Tree. If it made any abnormal movements, he would be able to react in time.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s worry was unnecessary. The Longevity Tree seemed to treat Demonic Neonate exceptionally well. It allowed Demonic Neonate to pluck the Longevity Fruit from its body without any reaction.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate was even more greedy than Zhou Wen. Regardless of its size or ripeness, she plucked all of them and stuffed them into the cloth bag.</p>
<p>As expected of an existence with a Supreme True Demon Life Soul. She sure is greedy and ruthless. Zhou Wen didn’t find it strange considering how Demonic Neonate dared to bite him and Xia Xuanyue before her death.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw Demonic Neonate pluck dozens of fruits from the tree. If the energy of a Longevity Fruit was at the peak of the Epic stage and close to the Mythical stage, these fruits would be impressive.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate finished plucking all the Longevity Fruits and stuffed them into the large cloth bag before dragging it back. She placed it in front of Zhou Wen, indicating for him to help her put it away.</p>
<p>“Alright, alright. I’ll help you store it away now.” Zhou Wen picked up the cloth bag and threw it into his chaos space. He glanced at the bald Longevity Tree and thought to himself, I wonder when this Longevity Tree will grow new fruits. I’ll bring Demonic Neonate to pluck the fruits when that happens.</p>
<p>After putting away the items, Zhou Wen also unsummoned Demonic Neonate. At the same time, he launched the game on his phone and took a look at Demonic Neonate’s stats.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate: Legendary (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Child of Dimension</p>
<p>Life Soul: Supreme True Demon</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: One Spin.</p>
<p>Strength: 21</p>
<p>Speed: 21</p>
<p>Constitution: 21</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 21</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Demonic Sword</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate’s stats disappointed Zhou Wen. Apart from her stats increasing to 21, nothing else changed. It was identical to before.</p>
<p>How can this be? She’s clearly so special. Why isn’t there much difference between her and an ordinary Mythical creature after advancement? Zhou Wen looked over and felt that the problem was most likely her Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>The Wheel of Destiny of the other Mythical Creatures were all kinds of miracles. Even if it wasn’t a strong Mythical creature like the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, it still had the miraculous ability to take his place in death.</p>
<p>However, Demonic Neonate’s Wheel of Destiny didn’t seem to have any miraculous abilities. The words “One Spin” didn’t explain anything.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate had a Life Providence, Life Soul, and Wheel of Destiny from the beginning. This means that she has already evolved to the Mythical stage. However, for some reason, she has returned to the Mortal stage and needed to evolve again. According to the words of the Wheel of Destiny, would One Spin mean that she has re-evolved once? If that’s the case, what benefits does it bring her to evolve again? Her Life Providence hasn’t increased, and her stats haven’t increased. If there are any benefits, they’re likely to be on the Wheel of Destiny… Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out why. He probably had to wait for her to advance to the Mythical stage before he knew what secrets her Wheel of Destiny had. All he could do was ignore it for now.</p>
<p>Even without a miracle, Demonic Neonate was already quite strong by relying only on the demonic sword.</p>
<p>After leaving the region where the Longevity Tree was, Zhou Wen passed through the Poison Bat Cave and arrived at the underground sea. He didn’t dare provoke the black dragon which pulled the wagon. The black dragon was bound, so it couldn’t catch up to him. Soon, Zhou Wen crossed the underground sea.</p>
<p>He arrived in front of the temple without any danger. After all, Zhou Wen had made countless runs of the Zhuolu underground ruins. Unless there was something that wasn’t in-game, nothing could harm him.</p>
<p>Upon arriving outside the temple, Zhou Wen saw the chariot. It was parked in front of the temple door and people were moving things.</p>
<p>Some of them were wearing military uniforms, while others were wearing ordinary exploration suits or companion beast armor. Judging from their ages, they must be the experts.</p>
<p>“Who’s there?” When Zhou Wen approached, they immediately discovered him. The soldiers all picked up their weapons and aimed at him.</p>
<p>“Battalion Commander Lu, it’s me,” Zhou Wen said when he saw someone he knew.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian heard Zhou Wen’s voice and took a closer look. He recognized Zhou Wen and immediately said in delight, “It’s Young Master Wen. Lower your weapons. He’s one of us.”</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian had risked his life with Zhou Wen, so their relationship naturally wasn’t ordinary. He welcomed Zhou Wen over and said warmly, “Young Master Wen, why did you come here alone? Didn’t Adjutant An come with you?”</p>
<p>“No, Ah Sheng has something on and can’t come. I came by myself.” Zhou Wen looked at the temple entrance and asked, “How’s the situation inside?”</p>
<p>“It’s not very optimistic. The experts have studied it for a long time and determined some of Torch Dragon’s and Qiongqi’s skills. However, just knowing these skills doesn’t mean we can deal with them. We have attempted to use Companion Beasts to probe. Basically, they are instantly killed. Only some Companion Beasts that are slightly smaller than insects can live longer and obtain some information,” Lu Yunxian explained the situation to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Battalion Commander Lu, this is?” An expert walked over and sized up Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Professor Lei, let me introduce you. This is Zhou Wen, Madam Lan’s son. Previously, it was all thanks to Young Master Wen for finding the stone artifact that we were able to open the temple’s door… Young Master Wen, this is Professor Lei Zhiguo, a folklore professor. Now, the research work of the temple is handled by Professor Lei,” Lu Yunxian introduced the two of them.</p>
<p>Lei Zhiguo nodded and said to Zhou Wen, “Zhou Wen, it’s too dangerous for you to walk through the cave passageway alone. Don’t go that way when you return. Go back on the chariot.”</p>
<p>Lei Zhiguo believed that Zhou Wen had come from the passageway Lord Alcohol and company had found, but he didn’t know that Zhou Wen had crossed the underground sea without the chariot.</p>
<p>“I don’t plan on returning. I want to enter the temple to take a look,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That won’t do. We haven’t researched the situation inside the temple yet. It’s too dangerous to enter the temple,” Lei Zhiguo refused immediately.</p>
<p>“Didn’t we already conquer the front temple? I’ll just go there and take a look. There won’t be any danger.” Zhou Wen didn’t wish to create unnecessary trouble and planned on entering the temple first.</p>
<p>“Crossing the Aoyin stone statue requires sacrifices to appease it. It’s not easy to make a trip back and forth here. It’s also very troublesome to transport the offerings here. There aren’t many offerings left here, and there’s only enough for one use.” Lei Zhiguo still didn’t agree. He paused for a moment before saying, “If you really want to go in, just wait two more days. We’ll be doing the next round of research then. When the time comes, you can come with us.”</p>
<p>What Lei Zhiguo said was reasonable, but Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to wait another two days.</p>
<h3 id='chapter564'>Chapter 564 Folklore Exper</h3>
<p>“I’ll figure out a solution for the sacrifice myself. Battalion Commander Lu, please take me in to have a look,” Zhou Wen said to Lu Yunxian.Before Lu Yunxian could say a word, Lei Zhiguo shook his head and said, “I’m in charge of this place. I have to ensure the safety of everyone here. If you wish to enter, you have to wait two more days. Otherwise, I will not give you permission to enter.”</p>
<p>Lei Zhiguo was just too stubborn. Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian couldn’t convince him at all. Furthermore, he was the one in charge here, so Zhou Wen couldn’t barge his way in.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll wait another two days then.” Zhou Wen thought that although he had already killed the Torch Dragon youngling a few times on the way, killing it two more times to familiarize himself with the process wasn’t a bad thing. Therefore, he agreed to wait two days before following them into the temple.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had recently farmed the Torch Dragon youngling, Medusa, and the Golden Battle God Halberd a few times, but the drop rate wasn’t as high as An Sheng had described. Most of the items dropped were stat crystals. Occasionally, an Essence Energy Skill Crystal would drop. Due to the limitations of his stats, Zhou Wen couldn’t use them nor take them out. All he could do was watch them disappear with each respawn.</p>
<p>Up to now, the Companion Egg that had dropped was only the Golden Battle God Halberd.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, the conditions here are rather poor. You can rest in my tent now.” Lu Yunxian took Zhou Wen into his tent.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian didn’t have a tent for himself because space was limited. Typically, it was three people to a tent. Lu Yunxian’s tent originally had two people living in it, so it was perfect for Zhou Wen to stay there.</p>
<p>The two of them chatted for a while about what happened after they had parted previously. It was mainly Lu Yunxian speaking. Zhou Wen mostly listened silently.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian had been stationed at the ruins all this while, having been responsible for cleaning up the dimensional creatures and protecting the experts.</p>
<p>Those comrades who had been with him previously had been transferred. Most of them were promoted and were deployed to other places.</p>
<p>As the two of them were chatting, a middle-aged man in his thirties walked in. Lu Yunxian introduced, “Young Master Wen, this is Professor Lei’s student, Qu Qingyun. He is also an expert in folklore. During his research on Torch Dragon and Qiongqi, he gave us quite a few valuable opinions.”</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian introduced Zhou Wen to Qu Qingyun. Qu Qingyun only said a few polite words before he went to bed. Clearly, he wasn’t interested in chatting with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian didn’t wish to disturb him, so they went out of the tent for a stroll. They slept immediately after they returned.</p>
<p>The next day, when Zhou Wen and company woke up, they heard the commotion outside. They went out to take a look and saw that the logistics team had sent their supplies over. Everyone was busy moving things.</p>
<p>Qu Qingyun also walked out of the tent. When he saw someone in the logistics team, his eyes lit up. He went over with a smile. “Head Nurse Xu, why are you here alone? It’s so dangerous.”</p>
<p>“We got a batch of newly-made medicine which needs to be injected into the soldiers. I’m afraid that they will get the dosage wrong, so I came here myself,” Xu Wen said to Qu Qingyun. When she saw Lu Yunxian, she immediately saw Zhou Wen, who was standing beside Lu Yunxian. She immediately revealed a look of delight.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, when did you come to Zhuolu? Why didn’t I see you at the encampment?” Xu Wen quickly walked towards Zhou Wen and asked in pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>“I didn’t go to the encampment because I came straight to the ruins. I only wanted to take a look and leave, but I was delayed by some matters. I still need to stay for another two days,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, that’s not very nice of you. Since you’re here in Zhuolu, how can you not visit us?” Xu Wen and Lu Yunxian were the same. They had been through thick and thin with Zhou Wen, so their relationship with him wasn’t something ordinary comrades could compare with.</p>
<p>Qu Qingyun couldn’t help but frown when he saw how friendly Xu Wen was with Zhou Wen, but he didn’t say a word.</p>
<p>“Xu Wen, deliver the injections to the soldiers first. Young Master Wen will be here for two days. It won’t be too late to catch up later,” said Lu Yunxian with a smile.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll get back to work then. Young Master Wen, let’s have a good chat later.” Xu Wen returned to her work.</p>
<p>“Go ahead and busy yourself.” Zhou Wen’s mood improved significantly. To be able to meet such sincere friends in such a dark place made him feel better than getting a treasure.</p>
<p>Two days quickly passed. Zhou Wen had grinded the Torch Dragon youngling twice in this period of time. Although it was a harrowing experience each time, Zhou Wen was confident that he could kill it safely.</p>
<p>Professor Lei and company were already prepared. They brought Zhou Wen and entered the temple. Even Xu Wen followed Lu Yunxian in.</p>
<p>“The dangers in the temple are unimaginable. Remember not to act on your own. You must abide by the arrangements, or you will harm others and yourself.” Lei Zhiguo was a little worried about Zhou Wen as he repeatedly told him.</p>
<p>“I understand.” Zhou Wen agreed seriously.</p>
<p>Only then did Lei Zhiguo feel a little relieved. He was afraid that Zhou Wen was the kind of scion who would disregard everything just because of his temper. He had no idea that Zhou Wen’s understanding of the temple far exceeded his.</p>
<p>Under the lead of Lei Zhiguo and the other experts and professors, Zhou Wen and company finally headed for the passageway where the Aoyin stone statue was.</p>
<p>“Head Nurse Xu, the Aoyin stone statue is extremely evil. If you touch it, it will hurt people. Stay by my side. If there is any danger, I can protect you,” Qu Qingyun said as he walked beside Xu Wen.</p>
<p>Anyone could tell that Qu Qingyun was interested in Xu Wen.</p>
<p>Xu Wen shook her head slightly and said, “Mr. Qu, you must be joking. I’m a soldier. It’s my duty to protect you.”</p>
<p>Qu Qingyun smiled and said, “Outside, you are naturally the one protecting me. However, in such a place, many problems can’t be solved by brute force. I should be the one assuring you.”</p>
<p>He paused for a moment before saying, “Just like this Aoyin stone statue. Even if the Overseer personally came, I’m afraid he wouldn’t be able to do anything to it. A blood sacrifice is needed for safe passage…”</p>
<p>Qu Qingyun kept trying to show off, but he did not know that Xu Wen was not a woman who lacked a sense of security.</p>
<p>On the contrary, she was a qualified soldier. Qu Qingyun’s words were actually questioning her ability as a soldier. This naturally displeased Xu Wen. However, she didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian, who was walking at the back, whispered to Zhou Wen, “Qu Qingyun was born into a rich family. His family background isn’t inferior to the An family’s, and he’s rather talented. Unfortunately, he’s too conceited. He’s not the type Xu Wen likes. I’m afraid he’s just wasting his efforts.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded slightly. Even someone with a low EQ like him could tell that Xu Wen didn’t have a good impression of him.</p>
<p>When everyone arrived in front of the Aoyin stone statue, Lei Zhiguo got Qu Qingyun to use a living creature as an offering to the Aoyin stone statue. Zhou Wen naturally wasn’t unfamiliar with this method. He was the one who had informed An Sheng of the method.</p>
<p>“It’s done. Everyone, please come this way.” Qu Qingyun bowed to the Aoyin stone statue before heading towards the Qiongqi temple.</p>
<h3 id='chapter565'>Chapter 565 No Need for Offerings Anymore</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen, who was walking behind, said to Lu Yunxian and Xu Wen, “I wish to visit Torch Dragon, so I won’t go with you to Qiongqi.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go with you,” Xu Wen said.</p>
<p>Although their conversation was very low, it still attracted Qu Qingyun’s attention.</p>
<p>“Didn’t Professor Lei say that you have to follow the arrangements and not walk around randomly? Are you sick of living?” When Qu Qingyun spoke, Professor Lei and the rest turned around and looked at them.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Professor Lei came over and asked.</p>
<p>“Professor Lei, I’m here to see the Torch Dragon temple. I won’t be going to the Qiongqi temple. Now that there’s an offering, it shouldn’t be a problem to go anywhere, right?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Professor Lei said, “Although that’s true in theory, the temple is very strange. Anything can happen. It’s best if we act separately. If anything happens, we can still collectively think of a solution. Why don’t we go to the Torch Dragon temple after our work is over?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head and said, “Those offerings just now can only last less than an hour. When you return from the Qiongqi temple, I’m afraid there won’t be much time left. I’ll go on my own. I’ll just take a look. Nothing will happen.”</p>
<p>“Don’t pretend to know what you don’t. The offerings we offered can last for at least two hours. If you don’t understand anything, don’t spout nonsense.” Qu Qingyun laughed coldly.</p>
<p>“More than two hours? Professor Lei, is that true?” Zhou Wen ignored Qu Qingyun’s sarcasm and asked Professor Lei with a frown.</p>
<p>“That’s right. For safety reasons, the offerings we provide each time will be enough to last for more than two hours. And our working hours must be controlled to be within one and a half hours. Today, we can end work earlier and take you to the Torch Dragon temple to have a look,” Professor Lei said.</p>
<p>“Professor Lei, I think it’s best if you examine the offerings again. I’m certain that your offerings can only last for an hour at most. If you really wish to stay in there for an hour and a half, I’m afraid it’ll be very difficult for you to come out alive,” Zhou Wen said seriously.</p>
<p>Qu Qingyun sneered and said, “The quantity of the offerings were carefully calculated. It has never gone wrong. As a layman, how can you be so sure?”</p>
<p>The offerings were personally placed by Qu Qingyun. Therefore, wasn’t Zhou Wen’s claim that there was something wrong with the offerings indirectly implying that Qu Qingyun had made a mistake?</p>
<p>Xu Wen couldn’t help but speak up for Zhou Wen. “Young Master Wen isn’t someone who speaks without reason. He definitely has his reasons for saying that there’s a problem.”</p>
<p>“What’s the logic behind this? Could it be that the results of our expert plans are wrong?” Qu Qingyun said disdainfully.</p>
<p>Professor Lei pondered for a moment before asking, “Zhou Wen, why did you say that the offerings can only last for an hour?”</p>
<p>“Professor Lei, the blood you used was obtained from the Poison Bat, right?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.</p>
<p>“That’s right. In the past, we used living sacrifices. Later on, we discovered that it was also possible to use fresh blood. Because it was too difficult to capture the Poison Bats alive, we switched to using blood. The amount used is calculated precisely, so mistakes usually do not happen,” Professor Lei said.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing wrong with the quantity, but there’s something wrong with the blood. The bat’s blood isn’t pure and has been mixed with other things. Therefore, the time it can last will be much shorter than you expected.” After Zhou Wen said that, he looked at Lu Yunxian and said, “Yunxian, this shouldn’t be a coincidence. Check everyone related to this matter carefully. It might be that someone had tampered with it.”</p>
<p>“What gives you the right to say that there’s a problem?” Qu Qingyun still felt that Zhou Wen was being unreasonable because Professor Lei hadn’t allowed him to go to the Torch Dragon temple.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, how did you know that there’s something else mixed in the bat’s blood? This is a very serious problem,” Professor Lei asked Zhou Wen with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>“Professor Lei, was it Adjutant An who told you about using a live sacrifice?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Professor Lei nodded.</p>
<p>“I told Adjutant An the method,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You really dare to say anything. How many times have you come to the temple? How dare you say that you discovered the method of the live sacrifices? Why don’t you just say that you have found a way to kill the Mythical creatures?” Qu Qingyun pouted.</p>
<p>“This matter is of paramount importance, but the blood has already been absorbed by the Aoyin stone statue. There’s no way to test it now.” Professor Lei looked at the Aoyin stone statue and pondered for a moment before saying, “Safety first. Since Zhou Wen said there’s a problem with the blood, let’s temporarily cancel the research.”</p>
<p>“Teacher, why do you have to listen to a layman like him spout nonsense? We have used it so many times with no problems. Why would there be a problem with the blood the moment he’s here? Isn’t this nonsense? Wasting the offerings this time and retrieving the bat’s blood again will take a few days. We can’t do a thing for the next few days.” Qu Qingyun said unhappily.</p>
<p>Professor Lei insisted, “Safety first. Since there are doubts, we can’t take the risk regardless of whether it’s true or not.”</p>
<p>Since Professor Lei had already said so, what else could Qu Qingyun say? He could only feel frustrated.</p>
<p>“Since you said that the offerings can last for about an hour and we have given up our plans for today, let’s go to the Torch Dragon temple to take a look. We can return in about ten minutes. Even if there’s a problem with the blood, it won’t hinder us,” Professor Lei said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, I’m going to kill Torch Dragon. If I take you along, I’m afraid Torch Dragon will be able to kill all of you in one breath.</p>
<p>“Professor Lei, I think it’s best you head to the Qiongqi temple. I’ll go to the Torch Dragon temple myself,” Zhou Wen said to Professor Lei.</p>
<p>Qu Qingyun retorted angrily, “You were the one who said that there’s something wrong with the offerings. You are also the one who said we shouldn’t go. Now, you are also the one saying we should go. You are basically playing every possible role!”</p>
<p>Professor Lei frowned and said, “If what you said is true, the offerings can only maintain the passage for less than an hour. Our preparatory work already takes half an hour. There’s no point in going.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as he looked at the Aoyin stone statue and walked in front of it.</p>
<p>No one knew what he was trying to do as they looked at him. Qu Qingyun opened his mouth to say something, but before he could say anything, he saw Zhou Wen standing in front of the Aoyin stone statue. Wielding the Bamboo Blade in hand, he suddenly unsheathed it.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked. It wasn’t that they hadn’t tried to destroy the Aoyin stone statue, but the result was a terrible loss.</p>
<p>Inside the temple, the Aoyin stone statue was strengthened by some kind of power. Despite being attacked by several Epic Companion Beasts, it could devour all of them.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen were to alarm the Aoyin stone statue, they would probably die.</p>
<p>Someone had already opened their mouth to stop Zhou Wen, but before they could say anything, the Bamboo Blade in Zhou Wen’s hand flashed and returned to its scabbard.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Professor Lei was shocked. The Aoyin stone statue split into two and collapsed on both sides.</p>
<p>“There’s no need for any offerings for the time being,” Zhou Wen said as he took two steps back.</p>
<p>566 Killing Torch Dragon</p>
<p>“Yunxian, you should stay here instead. Let’s investigate the problem with the blood offering first. Before we figure it out, don’t let anyone leave the temple. Also, find some reliable people to protect Professor Lei and company. Don’t let others have a chance of sneaking an attack,” Zhou Wen said to Lu Yunxian.</p>
<p>“Yes, Young Master Wen. I’ll do it now.” Lu Yunxian saluted and left.</p>
<p>Professor Lei and company still hadn’t reacted. Zhou Wen’s splitting of the Aoyin stone statue had shocked them greatly.</p>
<p>“Professor Lei, when Yunxian comes again, you can head to the Qiongqi Temple. Xu Wen, come with me.” Zhou Wen walked towards the passageway to the Torch Dragon temple.</p>
<p>Xu Wen hurriedly followed, leaving Professor Lei and the rest standing there looking at each other.</p>
<p>“I’ve only heard of Zhou Wen causing trouble for the An family in the past, causing the relationship between the An family and the Federation’s upper echelons to worsen. From the looks of it, the rumors are unreliable. The An family’s protection of him does make sense. He should still be in school, right?” Professor Lei sighed as he looked at the two halves of the Aoyin stone statue.</p>
<p>“I heard that he’s only in his freshman year,” another professor said.</p>
<p>“That makes him only seventeen or eighteen years old. To have such achievements at this age, if he were in my Lei family, we would be even more protective of him than the An family,” Professor Lei said.</p>
<p>Qu Qingyun snorted coldly. “He’s Wang Mingyuan’s disciple. Who knows what he has done in private? Otherwise, how could a student produce such achievements?”</p>
<p>Professor Lei glanced at Qu Qingyun and said meaningfully, “Qingyun, as researchers, the greatest taboo is to let our emotions affect our judgment.”</p>
<p>Qu Qingyun’s expression changed slightly when he heard that, but he quickly calmed down. He said respectfully, “Teacher is right. I know what to do.”</p>
<p>“Everyone, let’s rest for a while. When Battalion Commander Lu brings his men over, we’ll head to the Qiongqi temple again. Now that there are no restrictions from the Aoyin stone statue, we can work for longer periods. We have to replan our working arrangements…” Professor Lei picked up a notebook and began studying it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen led Xu Wen into the passageway to the Torch Dragon temple. After walking for a short distance, he stopped and said to Xu Wen, “Help me guard this place. No matter what happens inside, no matter what you hear, don’t come in. Don’t let anyone pass. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, what are you going to do?” Xu Wen was alarmed. She immediately knew that Zhou Wen’s trip wasn’t as simple as taking a look at the Torch Dragon temple.</p>
<p>“To kill Torch Dragon.” Zhou Wen didn’t hide it from her. He couldn’t hide it either. With that said, he headed for the tunnel.</p>
<p>Xu Wen was taken aback. By the time she reacted, Zhou Wen had already walked into the tunnel.</p>
<p>Although he had been in the game countless times, he had a different feeling coming here in real life.</p>
<p>After all, he wasn’t in-game. If he made any mistakes, he might die.</p>
<p>Standing in front of the temple’s metal door, Zhou Wen took a deep breath and closed his eyes, allowing his body and mind to calm down. It wasn’t to adjust himself to an optimal state, but to make himself treat what lay ahead normally.</p>
<p>If one needed to use 120% of their abilities to complete something, it would be a gamble. As for Zhou Wen, he didn’t need to gamble. As long as he completed what he needed to do like he always did, he could obtain the results he wanted.</p>
<p>When he opened his eyes, Zhou Wen had already calmed down. He summoned his armor and Six-Winged and was prepared to release the other crystal mirror at any time.</p>
<p>With the Golden Battle God Halberd in hand, Zhou Wen pushed open the temple’s door.</p>
<p>With the creaking sound of the metal door being pushed open, Zhou Wen saw the snake-like Torch Dragon youngling inside. It was even more ferocious and terrifying than in-game. It was also bigger and more oppressive.</p>
<p>Amidst the swirling poisonous smoke, Torch Dragon opened its mouth and spewed out billowing poisonous smoke.</p>
<p>The six wings on its back flapped as Zhou Wen circled behind Torch Dragon at an unbelievable speed. Torch Dragon swept its tail out, but everything was within Zhou Wen’s control. His body moved in a perfect trajectory, dodging Torch Dragon’s repeated attacks before he finally approached it.</p>
<p>The Golden Battle God Halberd stabbed into its scales with Golden Divine Light. Blood immediately gushed out from where the Golden Battle God Halberd hit as Torch Dragon let out a terrifying cry.</p>
<p>In an instant, rows of lanterns-like eyes lit up on its body. Their eyes reflected light like mirrors, illuminating the entire metallic temple.</p>
<p>The six wings on Zhou Wen’s back and the Golden Battle God Halberd in his hand were immediately unsummoned. The power of the Bright Torch Vision World shone on his armor and was reflected by the mirror, preventing him from being sucked into the vision world.</p>
<p>With his experience in-game, Zhou Wen knew very well that the next minute was the most critical period. As long as he could withstand this one minute, the Torch Dragon youngling would enter a weakened state. It would be incapable of using the Bright Torch Vision World again and all its assortment of skills would be greatly weakened. That would give him the confidence to kill Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>However, this one minute was difficult even in-game. He had to ensure that he didn’t make any mistakes.</p>
<p>He activated Transcendent Flying Immortal not to kill the enemy, but to escape. Zhou Wen’s speed was raised to the limit as he dodged behind a metal pillar. His every move had been carefully calculated and he knew the optimum way to stall for time.</p>
<p>The Torch Dragon youngling chased after him with all its might and circled around the metal pillar. The beams of monstrous lights shot out from the eyes like laser beams that crisscrossed in the temple.</p>
<p>Without any pause, he constantly moved. With the help of the metal pillar in the metallic temple, Zhou Wen dodged the Torch Dragon youngling’s lethal attack time and time again.</p>
<p>As time passed, Zhou Wen remained calm. He knew that he was getting closer and closer to killing the Torch Dragon youngling.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian quickly brought his men over and arranged for them to protect Professor Lei and company. Although it was a form of protection, it was actually a form of surveillance.</p>
<p>This was because those who could tamper with the blood would likely be Professor Lei and the others after excluding the ones who obtained the blood and transported it.</p>
<p>Although it didn’t seem likely for them to do that since they had to enter too, who knew if someone among them would find an excuse to leave early?</p>
<p>Therefore, while protecting them, he also had to prevent any spies from harming them.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian arranged his men and ran over to see Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, just as he reached the tunnel, he saw Xu Wen standing alone at the entrance. “Why are you here? Where’s Young Master Wen?”</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen went in,” Xu Wen said.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you go in with him?” Lu Yunxian felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen didn’t allow me to enter. He also said that no one is allowed in. He wants to kill Torch Dragon,” Xu Wen answered truthfully.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian’s expression changed drastically. “Why didn’t you stop him? You should know how terrifying Torch Dragon is. Although Young Master Wen is very strong, his chances of survival are still very slim when facing a creature like Torch Dragon…”</p>
<p>As Lu Yunxian spoke, he heard a sharp cry from the Torch Dragon temple.</p>
<h3 id='chapter567'>Chapter 567 Metal Block</h3>
<p>“That’s bad; something’s really happened.” Lu Yunxian rushed into the tunnel without any hesitation.“Young Master Wen said that no matter what happens, we can’t go in…” Xu Wen pulled Lu Yunxian back.</p>
<p>“Do you have any idea what’s happening now? If Young Master Wen dies inside, how are we going to answer to Adjutant An and Overseer An? Furthermore, Young Master Wen saved our lives.” Lu Yunxian shook off Xu Wen and rushed in.</p>
<p>Xu Wen gritted her teeth and charged in as well. She couldn’t be bothered anymore.</p>
<p>As the two of them rushed over, they heard terrifying screams and rumbling crashing. They were even more worried. From the sounds, the dragon was probably enraged.</p>
<p>Terrifying sounds and collisions echoed in the tunnel. Even Professor Lei, who was setting up various equipment, heard them.</p>
<p>“Oh no, it’s Torch Dragon. It has been stirred. Could Zhou Wen have opened the Torch Dragon temple’s door?” Professor Lei’s expression changed as he immediately ran over.</p>
<p>Qu Qingyun gloated when he heard that. “That Zhou Wen is so arrogant. He must have thought that he’s amazing and opened the door to the Torch Dragon temple.”</p>
<p>As researchers, they knew very well that Torch Dragon was a true Mythical creature. It wasn’t something Aoyin could compare with. It was almost certain death. They had already sacrificed many Epic Companion Beasts in their attempts to kill it.</p>
<p>When Professor Lei and company ran back to the three forks where the Aoyin stone statue was, Torch Dragon’s sharp cries suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian and Xu Wen had already run to the Torch Dragon temple and saw the gigantic Torch Dragon inside. This was the first time they had seen it with their own eyes.</p>
<p>Although they knew that Torch Dragon was inside, they weren’t the ones who personally saw Torch Dragon. Instead, it was the Companion Beasts they had placed inside.</p>
<p>At that moment, they saw Torch Dragon’s body. Its massive body and ferocious aura gave them immense pressure.</p>
<p>In front of Torch Dragon, they felt as tiny as ants.</p>
<p>However, in front of Torch Dragon was a man wearing silver mirror-like armor. He had six holy white flaming dragon wings on his back. He held a golden trident in his hand as he levitated in front of Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>And on Torch Dragon’s body, there were bloody wounds everywhere. The most terrifying part was that blood gushed out like a fountain from its head.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>In front of the god-like figure, Torch Dragon collapsed to the ground, dead. Blood flowed everywhere in the temple.</p>
<p>However, the figure floating above Torch Dragon looked spotless. Its body emitted a holy glow.</p>
<p>After a long pause, Lu Yunxian gulped and asked in disbelief, “Young… Young Master Wen… Is that you?”</p>
<p>“Why are you here? Didn’t I tell you not to enter?” Zhou Wen was certain that Torch Dragon was dead. He unsummoned his Companion Beasts and revealed his body.</p>
<p>“Sorry, it’s my fault.” Xu Wen hurriedly apologized.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. Since you’re here, help me look around. Is there anything in this temple left behind by the former principal and company?” Zhou Wen had searched the Torch Dragon temple in-game, but he hadn’t found any other way out. If the former principal and company really came here, they would probably leave something behind unless they were eaten clean by Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>For example, paper, backpacks, or instruments. No matter how good Torch Dragon’s appetite was, it probably wouldn’t eat those things.</p>
<p>As for Lu Yunxian and Xu Wen, Zhou Wen didn’t let them come in because he was afraid that they would die when Torch Dragon used the Bright Torch Vision World. Now that Torch Dragon was dead, it didn’t matter if Lu Yunxian and Xu Wen entered.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian and Xu Wen hurriedly searched the Torch Dragon temple with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>All his attention had been focused on Torch Dragon, preventing him from observing the temple. Now, Zhou Wen carefully sized up the temple and realized that the layout and decorations were the same as in-game.</p>
<p>However, the game was cartoonish and this place looked even more real. There were metal pillars and metal carvings everywhere, as well as some metal statues.</p>
<p>The carvings depicted monsters. For example, the ChiMeiWangliang that Zhou Wen had encountered outside had its image engraved on the metal wall.</p>
<p>There were many other monsters that Zhou Wen couldn’t name.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the main point of Zhou Wen’s observation. He wanted to find something, even if it was a skeleton, a piece of tattered cloth, or even a piece of paper.</p>
<p>However, there was nothing in the temple. Apart from the metal items, there was nothing else.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had mixed feelings. He couldn’t see the former principal and company’s belongings. It was possible that they had been swallowed by Torch Dragon, but it was also possible that they hadn’t come here. Therefore, there was still some hope. However, this hope was even more torturous.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, if you only look at it with your naked eye, you won’t be able to see any problems. I wish to use some equipment and the powers of our Companion Beasts to examine the area. Perhaps we can discover something.” Lu Yunxian looked around the temple before saying to Zhou Wen. Clearly, he hadn’t discovered anything.</p>
<p>“Alright, go and prepare.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>“Xu Wen, help Young Master Wen look around and see if Torch Dragon dropped any Companion Eggs and crystals. If there are, get Young Master Wen to put them away. In a while, there will be too many people and it will inevitably be troublesome,” Lu Yunxian told Xu Wen before leaving.</p>
<p>Xu Wen agreed and went to investigate Torch Dragon’s corpse.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that the chances of Torch Dragon dropping a Companion Egg were very low, so he didn’t deliberately search for it. He just carefully observed the temple and compared it to his memories in-game.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen discovered something. It was identical to the metallic style of the temple. It seemed to be something from the temple, but Zhou Wen had never seen it in-game.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked to the side of the temple and saw a metal artifact. It looked cubic like a metal block. It wasn’t too big and was about the size of a brick. Its color was the same as the metallic color of the palace. It was bluish-black.</p>
<p>This metal piece was placed above the head of a monster statue. The metal statue looked like a lion, a tiger, but nothing like them either. However, it looked like a legendary Qilin.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen this statue in-game, but he had never seen the metal piece on its head.</p>
<p>He reached out to push the metal block and realized that it wasn’t one with the statue. It was very easy for him to push it. Zhou Wen took it down and found it rather heavy. It was likely much heavier than a gold block of the same size.</p>
<p>The surface of the metal piece was very smooth and there was nothing on it. Zhou Wen flipped to the side to take a look, but there was nothing. However, when he flipped to the bottom, he realized that there was something different. There were a few carvings on the metal surface, splitting the metal into nine parts.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen seemed to have seen such a nine-part setup somewhere before. On careful thought, he immediately recalled that in Qin Xiyuan’s shop, the chained silver-haired Companion Beast was connected to a metal block. The metal block had a similar nine-number keypad.</p>
<h3 id='chapter568'>Chapter 568 Torch Dragon Egg</h3>
<p>However, the metal block that chained the strange person was many times bigger than this one. Furthermore, there were numbers on the nine-key pad. There were no numbers on the tiny metal block here. Each box was blank.Zhou Wen thought for a moment and stored the metal piece into the chaos space. He planned on studying it when he returned.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen… A Companion Egg… It’s Torch Dragon’s Companion Egg…” Xu Wen suddenly said in pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was just about to examine the temple again, to see if there was anything else that was different from the game, when he heard Xu Wen’s voice. He couldn’t help but be taken aback. He turned his head and saw Xu Wen holding a soccer-ball-sized crystal in her hand. It seemed to have billions of starlights circulating in it. It looked beautiful and surreal.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, quickly put it away. It’s best not to let others see it.” Xu Wen handed the Companion Egg to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took the Companion Egg and looked at it. He couldn’t help but sigh inwardly. I’ve grinded so many times in-game, but nothing dropped. I never expected it to drop in real life.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Outside the tunnel, Professor Lei and company couldn’t hear anything anymore. They were guessing what was happening inside.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Zhou Wen should have been killed by Torch Dragon. Qu Qingyun gloated inwardly, but he said, “Teacher, Zhou Wen is probably doomed. How do we explain this to Overseer An?”</p>
<p>Professor Lei was also feeling vexed. The An family definitely placed great importance on a cultivation genius like Zhou Wen. Although this matter had nothing to do with him, he was still in charge here. He ultimately had to bear some responsibility.</p>
<p>“Let’s head over to take a look first.” Professor Lei summoned his Companion Beast and planned on figuring out the situation to see if Zhou Wen could be saved.</p>
<p>Although the chances were slim, he had to give it a try.</p>
<p>“There’s really no need. Sending Companion Beasts over is just sending them to their deaths for nothing,” said Qu Qingyun.</p>
<p>Professor Lei was about to say something when he saw someone rush out of the tunnel. It was Lu Yunxian.</p>
<p>“Commander Lu, how’s the situation inside? Zhou Wen didn’t enter the Torch Dragon temple, did he?” Professor Lei hurriedly asked when he saw Lu Yunxian come out.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen is in the temple,” Lu Yunxian answered.</p>
<p>“It’s over.” When Professor Lei heard Lu Yunxian say that, he felt that Zhou Wen was definitely dead.</p>
<p>“Professor Lei, where’s your scanning equipment? Bring it with you. Follow me to the Torch Dragon temple,” Lu Yunxian said.</p>
<p>“What’s the use of taking in the equipment? Those instruments can only be used to gather data, not save someone,” Qu Qingyun said with a twitch of his lips.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian said with a smile, “Who are you saving? Young Master Wen has killed Torch Dragon. Hurry up and bring the equipment over. Check the interior of the temple carefully and see if there are any traces left behind by Old Mister Ouyang and the others.”</p>
<p>“What?” Professor Lei and the others thought that something was wrong with their ears.</p>
<p>“Battalion Commander Lu, are you joking with us?” A professor looked at Lu Yunxian in disbelief.</p>
<p>“What do you mean joking? Young Master Wen is waiting for you in the temple. Quickly bring the equipment and follow me,” Lu Yunxian said.</p>
<p>Professor Lei and company were doubtful, but seeing that Lu Yunxian didn’t seem to be joking, they could only gather their equipment and follow him to the Torch Dragon temple.</p>
<p>When they arrived outside the Torch Dragon temple and saw the massive body lying in a pool of blood, everyone was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>They had studied the area for months, but they had never seen Torch Dragon in person. Now, they had seen it with their own eyes, but Torch Dragon had already turned into a corpse.</p>
<p>Qu Qingyun’s expression was even more thoughtful, as if he couldn’t believe it. He was also somewhat horrified.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked back and forth at the temple several times. After confirming that it wasn’t different from in-game, he left the temple and handed it over to Professor Lei, Lu Yunxian, and company to deal with it. He returned to the encampment and waited for their results.</p>
<p>Although many electronic devices couldn’t be used in Zhuolu, there were still some more rather practical investigative methods that could be used. For example, blood tests, fingerprint tests, etc.</p>
<p>Some tiny skin tissues could be collected and tested.</p>
<p>The entire team did a carpet sweep of the area. Since Zhou Wen couldn’t do anything, he had to just wait for the results.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In Luoyang’s An family, An Sheng had just returned to the office. Just as he was reporting the hatching of his Companion Egg to An Tianzuo, the phone on his desk suddenly rang.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo gestured slightly and An Sheng answered the call.</p>
<p>“What?” An Sheng widened his eyes in shock after hearing a few words.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo frowned slightly as he waited for An Sheng to put down the phone before asking him, “What happened?”</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen… He went to the Zhuolu ruins…” An Sheng put down the phone and said to An Tianzuo with a look of shock.</p>
<p>“What did he do?” An Tianzuo asked with a frown. From An Sheng’s expression, he knew that it wasn’t as simple as going to the ruins. Something must have happened.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen… He… He… entered the Torch Dragon temple…” An Sheng said with a pained expression.</p>
<p>“Nonsense… What are Lu Yunxian and Professor Lei doing? How could they let him into the temple?” An Tianzuo immediately slammed the table and asked, “How is he now? Is he dead?”</p>
<p>“Dead,” An Sheng whispered.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo sat down on a chair and said through gritted teeth, “That bastard. How can I answer to the person at home? Does he think he’s a hero? What a bullsh*t hero. He’s just an ignorant boor. Does he think his life belongs to him? Thinking he can do whatever he wants. He doesn’t take anyone seriously and is selfish…”</p>
<p>An Sheng hadn’t seen An Tianzuo so angry in a long time. He realized that he had gone overboard.</p>
<p>“That… Overseer… I mean… Torch Dragon is dead…” An Sheng carefully said when An Tianzuo finally stopped.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo was taken aback. After a while, he stared at An Sheng and said, “What did you say? Say it again?”</p>
<p>“It was news from Zhuolu that Young Master Wen killed Torch Dragon. They have already entered the Torch Dragon temple to begin testing. They haven’t found anything yet,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo looked at An Sheng and his expression gradually turned cold. “Ah Sheng, it looks like you like you have become rather carefree recently.”</p>
<p>“Overseer, I was stunned by the news of Torch Dragon’s death. I couldn’t think straight. It really wasn’t intentional.” An Sheng immediately felt that things were going south.</p>
<p>“Since you are so carefree, go and guard Chess Mountain. You are not allowed to return without my orders,” said An Tianzuo coldly.</p>
<p>“Do I have a choice?” An Sheng said with a bitter expression.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” An Tianzuo said coldly.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll be setting off for Chess Mountain immediately.” An Sheng stood straight and saluted, but he didn’t go out. He said, “Something strange happened over there as well. The blood they used to sacrifice to the Aoyin stone statue seemed to have been tampered with.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen returned to his tent and took out the metal piece he had obtained from the temple to study it. Apart from being a little smaller, it looked very similar to the things that chained the silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<h3 id='chapter569'>Chapter 569 Password Box</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen tried using the mysterious phone’s camera function to snap the metal block, but there was no reaction. Clearly, he couldn’t store it on his phone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried pressing the nine keys again and realized that although it didn’t sink, there seemed to be a glimmer.</p>
<p>These grids can’t really be buttons, right? Zhou Wen pressed a few other keys. As long as the pressure reached a certain level, each grid would emit a flash.</p>
<p>Could it be that this metal block is really a box with a code? Then what’s the code? Could it be the ten numbers the former principal gave me? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>There were no numbers on the nine-key grid. Even if the ten numbers given by the former principal were really the passcode, he didn’t know which one corresponded to 1 or 9.</p>
<p>Typically, numbers are arranged in order. 123 is the first row. 456 is the second row. 789 is the third row. However, the nine-key grid is a square. I don’t know which orientation is the first row. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that he could give it a try.</p>
<p>If it was really arranged in order, he should be able to get results from making a few tries.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen tried using the ten-digit code. 5156942730. He remembered this number very clearly, but he soon realized that something was amiss.</p>
<p>As the grid only had nine buttons, and with one of the ten numbers being zero, there was no way to press this zero.</p>
<p>It doesn’t work at all. From the looks of it, I’m overthinking things. Zhou Wen looked at the metal piece and suddenly recalled that he had seen a similar grid on the metal block that chained the silver-haired Companion Beast. However, there were numbers on that grid.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully recalled what numbers were on the grid.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he had quite a good memory. Back then, he had looked at it carefully, so he quickly recalled it. He remembered that the numbers weren’t arranged according to the order, but were seemingly random.</p>
<p>249… 715… 603… I remember that the numbers on the metal block should be distributed in this way. Strange, there’s no 8 in the grid. Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he thought of the ten-digit code. Indeed, there was no number 8.</p>
<p>Although this didn’t mean anything, Zhou Wen suddenly felt that he could give it a try.</p>
<p>If the numbers on this small metal block are the same as the large metal block, then I should press it this way. Zhou Wen followed the numbers in his memory and pressed the ten-digit code, but the metal block didn’t react.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen spun the grid clockwise ninety degrees before continuing his attempts. After he pressed the tenth button, he suddenly heard a very soft click.</p>
<p>He was immediately delighted and hurriedly looked at the metal piece. Indeed, there was a crack on the side of it. With a gentle twist, the metal piece split into two.</p>
<p>It was different from the box Zhou Wen imagined. The metal piece was almost solid. Only in the middle was a circular crystal that was about the size of a small coin.</p>
<p>After the metal piece cracked, the crystal fell out and landed on the table.</p>
<p>The crystal was transparent, but there were many silver spots of light inside. They resembled countless swirling galaxies. It was extremely beautiful.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen picked up the crystal and took a careful look. It was slightly cold, but there weren’t any special energy fluctuations from it. On the side he saw, there was a symbol of an anchor engraved on it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t unfamiliar with the anchor symbol. He had seen it a few times before. A similar tattoo was on the large metal piece and Gu Dian also had a similar tattoo.</p>
<p>However, the symbol of the anchor was slightly different. There was no woman’s side profile on it. It was just a simple anchor symbol.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s just a coincidence? Zhou Wen thought as he flipped the crystal over to take a look. He couldn’t help but be stunned when he saw it.</p>
<p>The crystal looked transparent, but when he turned around, he realized that it wasn’t the case. There was a woman’s head engraved on this side. It was her side profile and she looked extremely beautiful. It was identical to the one Zhou Wen had seen on the anchor symbol.</p>
<p>It’s really related, but what’s the use of this item that looks like a commemorative coin? Why did the former principal tell me the passcode to the box? Why didn’t he give me the box or the crystal coin? If I hadn’t seen the metal block that chains the silver-haired Companion Beast, or if I didn’t come here to obtain the small metal block, it wouldn’t be of any use even if I had the passcode. Countless thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind, but the more he thought about it, the more suspicious he became.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I won’t be able to answer these questions unless I find the former principal. I wonder what use this crystal coin has? Zhou Wen studied it for a while, but he failed to find any use for it. All he could do was put it back into the metal block.</p>
<p>When the cracked metal pieces were placed together, it immediately seemed to have a powerful magnetic force that firmly sucked both parts together. Even the gap in the middle could not be seen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used his hand to try to pry it open a few times, but it remained solid, as though there was no gap.</p>
<p>This metal block sure is magical. I wonder if the large metal block that chains the silver-haired Companion Beast can be opened with the passcode. Although Zhou Wen felt that it was very likely, he didn’t plan on attempting it.</p>
<p>After putting the metal piece into the chaos space, Zhou Wen was about to take out the Torch Dragon Companion Egg to try hatching it when he suddenly heard someone walk into the tent.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, someone has arrived at the encampment. He wants to see you immediately. Adjutant An wants to talk to you,” Lu Yunxian said as he entered.</p>
<p>“Got it. How’s the investigation of the blood offerings?” Zhou Wen asked casually.</p>
<p>“We’re still investigating. There were more than twenty people involved, but we are investigating every one of them. We haven’t found anything yet. Adjutant An said that he will personally investigate this matter. Before he comes, none of the people related to this matter can leave,” Lu Yunxian said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was relieved when he heard that An Sheng was personally investigating the matter.</p>
<p>He took the chariot with Xu Wen, who was on her way back, and left the underground ruins. After returning to the encampment, Zhou Wen’s phone finally received a signal.</p>
<p>Before he could call An Sheng, An Sheng had already called. “Young Master Wen, didn’t you agree to wait for me to come back? Why didn’t you wait for me? It’s such a huge contribution. It’s really sad that you took all the credit alone.”</p>
<p>“Weren’t you hatching the Mythical pet? I just didn’t want you to be distracted,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, you have to remember to take me with you next time if there’s something this good. Look at how hard I’ve worked for so many years. Now, I’m only an adjutant. I also want to make a contribution. I want to be promoted. The next time you go to the Qiongqi temple, you have to take me along. Now that I have Love Letter, I should be able to help you,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll definitely take you with me next time.” Zhou Wen knew that An Sheng was joking. Although An Sheng was only an adjutant and his official position wasn’t high, his actual power was immense. He could be said to be a true figure of power in the Sunset army.</p>
<p>An Sheng said this mainly because he didn’t wish for Zhou Wen to take the risk alone.</p>
<p>“Did Torch Dragon drop anything good?” Since he got his intent across, An Sheng didn’t say anything else.</p>
<p>“A Companion Egg,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, you’re really lucky. Over the past few years, Overseer has also killed some Mythical creatures. However, his luck with Companion Eggs isn’t that good. When you went with us to kill Love Letter, a Companion Egg dropped. Now that you killed Torch Dragon, another Companion Egg has dropped. You’re just so lucky. If I were to kill Mythical creatures again, Young Master Wen, you have to help me,” An Sheng said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, My luck is good? Joke’s on you. I’ve killed countless Mythical creatures in-game, but none of them dropped Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>“By the way, Young Master Wen, we’ve obtained some information regarding the cube’s ranking,” An Sheng said solemnly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter570'>Chapter 570 Top Mythical</h3>
<p>“Currently, there are internal rumors amongst the six families that as long as a Companion Beast enters the rankings, they will have a chance of being further improved in the future,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by further improved? Enhanced?” Zhou Wen remembered that The Thearch had told him that only the first Companion Egg on the rankings would obtain the opportunity to be enhanced.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. The rumors are all over the place right now. It’s difficult to determine their authenticity. However, the Xia, Zhang, and Dugu families already have Mythical Companion Beasts on the rankings. Furthermore, there are also some unknown Companion Beasts on the rankings. Haven’t you realized that your Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s ranking has dropped?” An Sheng asked.</p>
<p>“I really didn’t notice that.” Zhou Wen had no time to pay attention to those things. He had been studying how to kill Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>“Your Six-Winged’s ranking has already dropped to fifth place. The number one pet is no longer the Death of the Underworld. It has been replaced by a Companion Beast named Primordial Sword Immortal. Death of the Underworld is second, Genie is third, Frost Giant is fourth, and your Six-Winged Guardian Dragon is fifth. There are already more than thirty Companion Beasts on the rankings. The number one Primordial Sword Immortal doesn’t seem to belong to the six families. We haven’t found out who it belongs to. The six families have a real headache now. The number of Companion Beasts that aren’t from the six families on the rankings has increased significantly.” An Sheng explained the situation to Zhou Wen in detail.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you let Love Letter give it a try?” Zhou Wen didn’t care much about the ranking. After all, it was only a ranking for humanity’s Companion Beasts. Compared to dimensional creatures, humans were still too weak. Just thirty Mythical Companion Beasts were nothing in the massive dimensional Mythical system.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t make a difference even if I put it up on the rankings. The current rankings definitely aren’t final. There are still many Companion Beasts from the six families that haven’t been placed. The truly powerful ones haven’t shown up. Furthermore, the bigwigs from all over the world might not be as rich as the six families, but they should have some Mythical pets. When the time comes, the rankings will definitely exceed a hundred entries. Even if my Love Letter gets on the rankings now, it’ll drop out sooner or later.”</p>
<p>After a pause, An Sheng said, “On the other hand, if you obtain the Torch Dragon Companion Beast, quickly hatch it. Its ranking will definitely be very high. It might even have a chance of reaching first place. Rumor has it that the higher the ranking, the greater the opportunities in the future. However, you have to be careful. The stronger a Mythical Companion Beast is, the harder it is to hatch. It might even kill you. I have a few ways to hatch a Mythical Companion Beast. I’ll send you some information later.”</p>
<p>After chatting with An Sheng for a while, Zhou Wen hung up and found a room to rest. He took out the Torch Dragon Companion Egg and planned on hatching it.</p>
<p>No one would mind having too many Mythical Companion Beasts. More importantly, every Mythical Companion Beast had different abilities. No matter how strong a Mythical Companion Beast was, it was impossible for it to be invincible. In different situations, it was best to have Companion Beasts with different abilities.</p>
<p>Just like Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World, it could instantly kill Mythical Companion Beasts of the same level, but an Epic Jade Crystal Spirit armor could restrain it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had infinite Essence Energy, so he naturally didn’t need a special hatching method. He picked up the Torch Dragon egg and began injecting Essence Energy to incubate it.</p>
<p>The moment his Essence Energy touched the Torch Dragon egg, Zhou Wen immediately felt a powerful suction force suck his Essence Energy in like a whale.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt his Essence Energy suddenly empty. Thankfully, he quickly replenished it. If it were anyone else, they would probably be sucked dry.</p>
<p>As the Essence Energy surged in, the Companion Egg gradually lit up. It was as though countless stars were swirling around it. When it finally stopped absorbing Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy, the Companion Egg transformed into a stream of starlight that flew towards Zhou Wen’s left eye and fused into his pupils.</p>
<p>If one took a closer look, there was a Torch Dragon-like dark pattern in Zhou Wen’s black pupils. As the color was similar, it was very difficult for ordinary people to tell.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Torch Dragon tattoo didn’t affect Zhou Wen’s vision, so it didn’t hinder him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen switched on his phone and checked Torch Dragon’s information. This might be the strongest Companion Beast he currently had. Even the Golden Battle God Halberd would be considered inferior.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon Youngling: Mythical (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Son of a World King</p>
<p>Life Soul: Eye of Spacetime</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Bright Torch Vision World</p>
<p>Strength: 81</p>
<p>Speed: 81</p>
<p>Constitution: 81</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 81</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Torch Eyes, Dragon Breath, World King Transformation</p>
<p>Companion Form: Eye Mirror</p>
<p>Indeed, it’s a top-notch Mythical. All its stats are 81. It’s a pleasure looking at it. It’s even stronger than the strengthened Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. Zhou Wen summoned Torch Dragon in-game.</p>
<p>The gigantic Torch Dragon immediately appeared in the game’s interface. It looked identical to the one in real life. Zhou Wen tried all kinds of skills.</p>
<p>Apart from having a few less skills than the real Torch Dragon, there was basically no difference. The few skills that were lacking were not important skills. The core abilities were all present.</p>
<p>The truly invincible ones were the Bright Torch Vision World and the World King Transformation. The Bright Torch Vision World could reflect all things. Once its gaze landed on someone, they would be sucked into the Vision World and vanish without a trace.</p>
<p>The World King Transformation was Torch Dragon’s final transformation skill. With the Eye of Spacetime appearing all over his body and the Bright Torch Vision World, it was practically invincible.</p>
<p>However, after using the World King Transformation, Torch Dragon would enter an overall weakened state. Its combat strength would drop drastically to the same level as the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon in a short period of time. It would take a long time to recover.</p>
<p>Even if it doesn’t use World King Transformation, Torch Dragon is still a top-notch combat force. I wonder if Torch Dragon will be ranked first if it enters the rankings? Zhou Wen guessed inwardly.</p>
<p>Bringing Torch Dragon along, Zhou Wen headed for the temple in-game. He wanted to give it a try and see what effects Torch Dragon and the Bright Torch Vision World had against the Bright Torch Vision World. It would definitely be exciting.</p>
<p>Finally, he arrived at the Torch Dragon temple. Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen ordered his Torch Dragon to use the Bright Torch Vision World. Torch Dragon’s eyes immediately turned into a mirror that emitted a sun-like glow.</p>
<p>As for the Torch Dragon in the temple, it seemed to sense danger. It also used the Bright Torch Vision World. In the next second, a strange scene happened. The two Torch Dragons vanished into thin air. A strange spatial vortex appeared in the temple, sweeping everything in. The game screen immediately turned black.</p>
<p>The Bright Torch Vision World versus Bright Torch Vision World is an annihilative disaster! Zhou Wen realized something unusual as he had an ominous feeling. After entering the game again, Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to head to the Torch Dragon temple. Instead, he headed for the Poison Bat Cave.</p>
<p>571 An Sheng“s Arrival</p>
<p>Groups of Poison Bats flew over. With Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World, large swaths of Poison Bats and a White Shadow of Poison were reflected into the Vision World, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>The large number of Poison Bats in the cave vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>As expected! Zhou Wen’s expression didn’t look good. This was because at least two hundred Poison Bats had been sucked into the Vision World. They were nowhere to be seen, with no corpses indicating their deaths. The key point was that the game constantly indicated that the Poison Bat had been killed, but nothing dropped.</p>
<p>This was a very troublesome problem. The dimensional creatures that were sucked into the Bright Torch Vision World wouldn’t drop anything, or they might have dropped something, only to have them vanish in the Vision World.</p>
<p>If it doesn’t drop, so be it. Zhou Wen didn’t feel overly conflicted. This time, he took the Torch Dragon to the Qiongqi temple.</p>
<p>Qiongqi was very powerful and Zhou Wen was no match for it with the Six-Winged Golden Battle God Halberd and the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General that restrained it. However, Qiongqi was no match for Torch Dragon Youngling.</p>
<p>The trouble was—Qiongqi’s speed was too fast—allowing it to constantly avoid Torch Dragon’s vision. However, by unleashing World King Transformation, Qiongqi had nowhere to run. It was directly sucked into the Vision World and instantly killed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Bright Torch Vision World prevented anything from dropping despite killing Qiongqi.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it won’t be a problem to use Torch Dragon to kill Qiongqi. Zhou Wen was rather satisfied with the outcome. It didn’t matter if anything dropped. As long as he could kill Qiongqi, he could enter the Qiongqi Temple.</p>
<p>If they couldn’t find the former principal in the Qiongqi temple, it meant that he had most likely been killed.</p>
<p>In fact, after discovering the metal piece, Zhou Wen already felt that the former principal and company had gone to the Torch Dragon temple. The chances of them heading to Qiongqi temple were relatively low.</p>
<p>As for why he didn’t discover the former principal and company’s relics, Zhou Wen felt that they might have been sucked into the Bright Torch Vision World, so nothing remained.</p>
<p>Only the metal piece had been left behind for some reason. Or perhaps it was originally something from the temple—the former principal and the others had merely discovered it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to head to the Qiongqi temple. An Sheng said that he would head over in the next two days, so he planned on waiting for him.</p>
<p>After all, with Torch Dragon around, killing Qiongqi wasn’t too risky. It was fine to wait for An Sheng.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed when he took the Torch Dragon with him to grind the Torch Dragon. If Torch Dragon used Bright Torch Vision World, he wouldn’t obtain any benefits even if he killed Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>However, he wasn’t a match for Torch Dragon in the temple without using Bright Torch Vision World. He would still be killed instantly by the Bright Torch Vision World, so Zhou Wen had no choice but to use the old method to kill the Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>When Torch Dragon appeared in his companion form, it gave Zhou Wen a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon’s Companion Form was similar to contact lenses. It directly appeared in Zhou Wen’s left eye. Under such circumstances, Zhou Wen’s left eye could also use Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>Although it drained him greatly, it wasn’t a problem for Zhou Wen who had infinite Essence Energy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this move can only be used to kill enemies, but it can’t drop dimensional crystals or Companion Eggs. Zhou Wen planned on using Torch Dragon as his trump card. He could also use it when grinding Mythical creatures, but without using the Bright Torch Vision World and World King Transformation, its combat strength was only slightly stronger than the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon.</p>
<p>An Sheng arrived very quickly. Zhou Wen didn’t even wait two days before An Sheng arrived at the encampment.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen told An Sheng about hatching the Torch Dragon Youngling and found an uninhabited place. There, he demonstrated Torch Dragon’s abilities to him, telling him that he could kill Qiongqi with Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>“This Torch Dragon Youngling is practically invincible. It’s very likely to be first on the rankings. However, I have to do something before we kill Qiongqi,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Is it related to the blood offerings?” Zhou Wen guessed.</p>
<p>An Sheng nodded slightly. “I’m constantly updated by the news over here. I’ve roughly guessed who it is. If I don’t deal with this fellow now, I’m afraid something will happen in the future. Let’s head to the temple and settle this matter.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen entered the temple with An Sheng. Everyone related to the blood offerings was there.</p>
<p>When Professor Lei saw Zhou Wen and An Sheng, he came over and said excitedly, “Young Master Wen, Adjutant An, our research has made quite a bit of progress recently. From the murals and statues inside the Torch Dragon Temple, that palace should be related to the Mythical Chiyou…”</p>
<p>“Professor Lei, report the details to the Overseer in the future. Please gather everyone. I have something to say,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Alright, Little Zhao, call everyone over,” Professor Lei said to one of his students.</p>
<p>Soon, the student called everyone over. When everyone was present, Professor Lei frowned and asked, “Where’s Qingyun?”</p>
<p>“Senior Brother Qu was a little unwell yesterday and had been resting in the tent. When I called him just now, he seemed to be very sick. He was a little muddle-headed and didn’t wake up,” Little Zhao said.</p>
<p>“In that case, I’ll get him.” An Sheng seemed to realize something as he quickly walked towards Qu Qingyun’s tent.</p>
<p>Everyone followed him. An Sheng pulled open the tent and saw Qu Qingyun sleeping inside with the blanket wrapped around him. His body seemed to be trembling like a patient suffering from a severe cold.</p>
<p>An Sheng walked over and reached out to pull the blanket away. He saw Qu Qingyun curled up into a ball as his body trembled.</p>
<p>“Qingyun, what’s wrong?” Professor Lei saw that Qu Qingyun seemed to be seriously ill and wanted to go up to check on him.</p>
<p>However, An Sheng stopped Professor Lei and pulled out a flying dagger before throwing it at Qu Qingyun.</p>
<p>The flying dagger instantly stabbed into Qu Qingyun’s body. With a bang, a white fog erupted from the body. After the white fog dissipated, they saw the dagger nailing the corpse of a fox to the ground.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Professor Lei and the others were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“Adjutant An, I’ll lead my men to chase after him.” Lu Yunxian’s expression changed. Qu Qingyun slept in the same tent as him, but he had actually failed to notice anything amiss.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. This person isn’t simple. Furthermore, the terrain in the ruins is too difficult. It’s easy for accidents to happen. Watch the vicinity of the temple and investigate the important areas. Don’t let him have another chance,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Lu Yunxian went to make arrangements.</p>
<p>The matter was already very clear. Even Professor Lei and the rest had guessed that there must be something wrong with Qu Qingyun’s sudden disappearance and him playing such a trick. It probably had something to do with the blood offerings.</p>
<p>“Adjutant An, I really didn’t expect Qingyun to do such a thing…” Professor Lei said in embarrassment.</p>
<p>“Professor Lei, don’t blame yourself. Everyone has cavities in their teeth. You weren’t to know.” Having settled the matter, An Sheng headed to the Qiongqi temple with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>572 Killing Qiongqi</p>
<p>The duo went all the way to the Qiongqi temple. With Torch Dragon as their main force, An Sheng and Zhou Wen didn’t even plan on entering.</p>
<p>Before the temple door opened, Zhou Wen summoned Six-Winged and Torch Dragon. At the same time, he summoned the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>“Is this tiger-riding Companion Beast also at the Mythical stage?” An Sheng asked curiously as he sized up the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>“It’s not at the Mythical stage. It’s just an Epic Companion Beast. However, his Life Providence has some restraining effects on Qiongqi. It will make killing Qiongqi easier,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>These words were very honest. Without the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, Torch Dragon could only kill Qiongqi in its World King Transformation state. And with the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, there was no need to use the World King Transformation. A single Bright Torch Vision World would seal the deal.</p>
<p>“There’s actually a Life Providence that can restrain Mythical creatures. Although it’s at the Epic stage, it’s sufficiently precious,” An Sheng commented.</p>
<p>“Yes, it wasn’t easy to obtain it. It’ll probably be difficult to find a second one,” Zhou Wen said as he opened the temple door.</p>
<p>Qiongqi was inside the temple. The moment the door opened, it pounced forward. However, due to the influence of the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, its speed decreased significantly.</p>
<p>Under Zhou Wen’s orders, Torch Dragon activated the Bright Torch Vision World to which Qiongqi dodged. Unfortunately, its speed was greatly reduced and it failed to escape. Torch Dragon immediately swept its gaze at it, making it disappear.</p>
<p>“Torch Dragon is really too strong! It will be unreasonable if it can’t get first on the rankings,” An Sheng praised when he saw Qiongqi being settled so easily.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also felt that Torch Dragon was very strong, but he wondered if it could defeat the guardian of a white cocoon.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, after being killed by the Bright Torch Vision World, nothing will be left. Even if dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs drop, I won’t be able to take them out. There are a lot of limitations,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That’s not too good, but it’s still very strong. There are some mysterious dimensional zones with many good things inside, but they are protected by terrifying Mythical creatures. It’s almost impossible to get the treasures out. Having this Torch Dragon makes things much simpler. When I’m free later, I’ll take you to those places to take a look. After a spin through them, we’ll definitely be able to obtain some good things,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>The duo entered the Qiongqi temple. Inside the stone temple, there were also many stone sculptures and murals. Many of the murals depicted a huge battle. Various creatures that looked like monsters and ghosts were fighting, while humans were just cannon fodder. The monsters were the main combat force.</p>
<p>The two of them carefully explored the temple several times, but they didn’t find any passageway or any clues left behind by the former principal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t discover anything different about the temple versus the in-game temple. It was completely identical.</p>
<p>“Let Professor Lei and the rest come over and study it. They are the professionals in this area. If there are any clues, they will definitely discover them,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“That’s all we can do.” Zhou Wen nodded helplessly.</p>
<p>He now knew that the former principal and company were doomed. They had either been killed by Torch Dragon or eaten by Qiongqi. No matter what the possibility was, there was no need to investigate further.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen planned on returning to school. The outcome was no longer important to him. No matter how the former principal died, it was impossible for him to come back to life.</p>
<p>“Wait another two days for me. When I’m done here, we can return together. I can also take you to kill a few Mythical creatures on the way. It’s a crime not to use such a powerful Torch Dragon and Six-Winged Guardian Dragon,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“What will you be doing here?” Zhou Wen looked puzzled as he asked.</p>
<p>“Of course I have to find Qu Qingyun,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Will he still be here?” Zhou Wen felt that Qu Qingyun had definitely escaped Zhuolu.</p>
<p>“According to the time, he was definitely still inside the underground ruins when we entered. The underground ruins only have one exit. I planted some Companion Beasts at the exit, but I haven’t detected his departure. That means he’s definitely still here,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“When did you set up the Companion Beasts? Why didn’t I know?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“It’s an ordinary Companion Beast. Apart from being small, it doesn’t have any special abilities. However, it’s very useful for monitoring,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Alright, I also want to know why Qu Qingyun did that. Before I came, he hadn’t done anything. Yet, he took action after I came. This clearly isn’t a coincidence.” Zhou Wen felt that Qu Qingyun was targeting him, not Professor Lei and company. Otherwise, he could have done it long ago.</p>
<p>“If I want to find him, I’ll have to rely on Love Letter,” An Sheng said as he summoned Love Letter.</p>
<p>Although its name was Love Letter, it looked like a huge scorpion. There were many strange blood-colored texts on its body. No matter how one looked at it, it had nothing to do with a romantic love letter.</p>
<p>“Does Love Letter have the ability to find people?” Back when An Tianzuo fought Love Letter, he was also present. He had never seen Love Letter display such abilities.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t have the ability to find people, but its language skills will be useful.” An Sheng left the temple with Love Letter.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed beside him and saw that Love Letter would open the wall or the ground at a fixed distance every time. The words quickly fused into the rock.</p>
<p>There were also some words that landed on the plants in the ruins, like grass. It was unknown what they could do.</p>
<p>“Although these words don’t have any offensive power, Love Letter will naturally sense any creature that passes by. I left something in all the necessary areas. Unless Qu Qingyun doesn’t move in the ruins, we will be able to catch him sooner or later,” An Sheng explained.</p>
<p>“Take your time. I wish to visit the underground sea.” Zhou Wen had nothing to do, so he wanted to take a look.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already explored most of the Zhuolu underground ruins. Now, he didn’t even have a place to explore. All that was left was the underground sea.</p>
<p>Ignoring the nine black dragons and the cocoon in the war wagon, there was also something strange inside the sapphire sky. Zhou Wen planned on taking this opportunity to take a look. Perhaps, in reality, he could discover something he couldn’t see in-game.</p>
<p>“Alright, I still need a while. You can take your time.”</p>
<p>After separating from An Sheng, Zhou Wen headed for the underground sea. There weren’t many things that could threaten him in the underground ruins. Even against the nine black dragons, Zhou Wen had the strength to fight them.</p>
<p>Of course, that was under the circumstances that the nine black dragons were chained. If their shackles were unlocked, Zhou Wen would have to rely on Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>When he passed the white desert, Zhou Wen saw the tattered flag and the skeleton sitting under it.</p>
<p>Apart from suddenly waking up the first time Zhou Wen passed by, the skeleton didn’t react.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully sized up the symbol on the animal hide flag. It was indeed the symbol of a ship’s anchor. He wanted to ask the skeleton what their flag meant, but unfortunately, the skeleton remained motionless like a dead object. </p>
<h3 id='chapter573'>Chapter 573 Bone Sand</h3>
<p>I wonder how the skeleton will react if I pull the flag away? Zhou Wen mused. Even if he pulled out the flag, he didn’t know what he could do with it.</p>
<p>After sizing up the vine flag and beast hide, Zhou Wen suddenly realized that the sand beneath the flagpole was different from the white sand elsewhere.</p>
<p>When he walked over to take a closer look, he saw that the sand granules beside the flag pole were rather large. Some of them were about the size of table tennis balls, while the smaller ones were the size of glass beads. Furthermore, the shapes were irregular.</p>
<p>As the graphics in-game were cartoonish, he couldn’t distinguish them clearly. However, when Zhou Wen looked carefully, he realized that the white sand wasn’t sand, but bones.</p>
<p>Could it be that this white desert isn’t a real desert, but made of weathered bones? Zhou Wen looked at the endless white desert and couldn’t help but shiver.</p>
<p>If the sand in the desert were really bone granules, how many creatures had to die here to form such a huge desert?</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was obvious that things weren’t that simple for their bones to become sand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen grabbed a handful of sand and carefully looked at it. The more he looked at it, the more it looked like it was formed from shattered bones. However, the size and shape of the sand grains were very similar. It was unknown how it was formed.</p>
<p>Could it be that this is actually the main battlefield of Zhuolu back then? The dead creatures in the battle were buried here? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and summoned the Guardian Dragon and Torch Dragon. He made the two huge monsters dig open the sand to see if there was anything underneath.</p>
<p>In the Zhuolu battle back then, other than humans, any creature that participated in it was at the Mythical stage. Furthermore, they had quite a number of treasures. If he could dig up one or two, even damaged relics would have huge value.</p>
<p>Six-Winged and Torch Dragon were huge, and they had immense strength. They were even more powerful than excavators. The Guardian Dragon swiped its front claws and dug out a huge hole.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon plunged into the sea of sand and swam beneath it. Soon, it parted the sand, revealing a ravine.</p>
<p>At the spot Torch Dragon had dug out, something was exposed. It looked like ivory—a sharp horn. Zhou Wen hurriedly ordered Torch Dragon to continue digging.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon and Six-Winged dug a huge pit that was more than ten meters deep. Many parts of the object were revealed. They were not teeth, but a huge skeleton. What he saw was the tip of one of the rib cages. There were two rows of such a sternum on the skeleton. There were at least twenty to thirty bones.</p>
<p>The entire skeleton resembled the bones of a cow, but it was many times bigger than cow bones. Furthermore, it didn’t have a skull.</p>
<p>Apart from the skeleton, there was nothing else. However, this left Zhou Wen somewhat expectant. Since there was really a monster’s bones below, there might be something that had been left behind from the battle or some dimensional crystals left behind.</p>
<p>If he could dig up a few Essence Energy Skill Crystals, he would make a killing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen got Six-Winged and Torch Dragon to constantly dig in the desert, hoping to find something.</p>
<p>Not long after, he had dug out quite a number of bones under the desert. The bones had different shapes, so they likely didn’t belong to the same creature.</p>
<p>However, the strange thing was that the bones were crystalline, akin to jade. They seemed to have fossilized, but they maintained a moist texture.</p>
<p>Many bones shattered when Six-Winged and Torch Dragon touched them.</p>
<p>Unlike ordinary bones, these bones were like tempered glass. Once they shattered, they would turn into tiny particles that scattered in the white sand, becoming a part of the white desert.</p>
<p>Indeed, this white desert is a bone sand desert. Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>From the scale of the white desert, the intense battle back then far exceeded anyone’s imaginations. Many Mythical creatures had definitely died here.</p>
<p>Six-Winged and Torch Dragon dug holes in the sea of sand, almost turning half the desert over.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, other than some bones, everything seemed to have decayed and melted. The bones remained for some reason, but most of them had already turned into bone sand.</p>
<p>Most likely, those that hadn’t turned into bone sand were terrifying Mythical creatures.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Six-Winged seemed to dig out something as it roared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen went over to take a look and saw a rhinoceros’s head in the sandpit that was split open by the six wings. However, this head was much bigger than a rhinoceros on Earth. It resembled the size of a train engine.</p>
<p>Although it had turned into jade, the rhinoceros’ head remained intact. It was still very lifelike and there weren’t any scars on its head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen got Six-Winged and Torch Dragon to dig out the rhinoceros’ body. Although there were many bones here, it maintained its complete form like a giant rhinoceros. This was the first one.</p>
<p>However, this gigantic rhinoceros was like a jade statue. Its body had completely transformed into jade and there was no vitality left in its body. It definitely couldn’t come back to life.</p>
<p>Wait, I don’t see any injuries on its body. How did it die? Zhou Wen carefully sized up the rhinoceros and suddenly had an idea.</p>
<p>Perhaps the white desert’s bone sand isn’t purely bone. Instead, the creatures here are affected by some unknown force. Their bodies are like the rhinoceros, turning into stone. Then, they shatter and become bone sand… The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more convinced he was.</p>
<p>What kind of terrifying power made so many creatures turn into bone sand? Which faction does the expert who used this power belong to? Yellow Emperor or Chiyou? Zhou Wen guessed.</p>
<p>The rhinoceros was still intact after being fossilized. It didn’t turn into bone sand like ordinary creatures. It must have been extraordinary when it was alive.</p>
<p>Even so, it still couldn’t escape the influence of the terrifying power, turning into its present state.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out and struck the rhinoceros a few times. With two clangs, the sound was extremely crisp as though he had struck a jade artifact or bone. The rhinoceros’ body didn’t shatter due to the external force.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon and Six-Winged dug the nearby area, but apart from some weak fossilized bones, they didn’t discover anything.</p>
<p>It can’t be? Could it be that only some primitive creatures participated in the battle? They only engaged in melee combat and didn’t even use divine weapons? Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>Cracks suddenly appeared on the rhinoceros’ body. More and more cracks appeared as though it was about to shatter.</p>
<p>Perhaps Torch Dragon and Six-Winged collided into it while they were excavating. What a pity. Bringing it back as a specimen would have been good. After all, it’s an ancient Mythical creature. To be able to participate in such a battle is definitely no trifling matter. Just as Zhou Wen was feeling poignant, the jade-like rhinoceros had already shattered.</p>
<p>Something dropped from the rhino’s cracked abdomen. Unlike the shattered bone sand, the thing was still squirming.</p>
<h3 id='chapter574'>Chapter 574 A Snail</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen was surprised that the thing which dropped from the rhinoceros’ stomach was a living creature. Furthermore, it looked like a snail.</p>
<p>The fist-sized snail shell was crystalline and translucent.</p>
<p>The snail’s body that was exposed was transparent like a flawless crystal. After the snail fell out, it slowly crawled on the sand with its shell.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen retreated as though he was facing a formidable enemy. At the same time, he ordered the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon and Torch Dragon to attack the snail.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know the origins of the snail, but he knew one thing very well. In such a terrifying ancient battle, even a powerful creature like the rhinoceros had fossilized. Yet, this snail had survived inside the rhinoceros’ stomach.</p>
<p>No matter how it did it, it definitely wouldn’t have been easy.</p>
<p>Of course, it was also possible that the fellow had crawled in later, but no matter what, Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to take the risk.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon and Six-Winged simultaneously spat out dragon breath at the snail. The snail immediately shrank into its shell. Two terrifying dragon breaths sprayed on the snail’s shell, melting away the surrounding bone sand and forming a huge crater.</p>
<p>However, after the dragon breaths stopped, the snail shell in the pit remained unharmed. The attacks of the two Mythical pets failed to penetrate the snail shell.</p>
<p>Bright Torch Vision World. Zhou Wen increasingly found the snail terrifying. He ordered Torch Dragon to use its Wheel of Destiny powers.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon’s eyes turned into a mirror as it looked at the snail in the pit, but in the blink of an eye, the snail had vanished.</p>
<p>The power of the Bright Torch Vision World absorbed large amounts of bone sand. A large swath of bone sand vanished as though a huge hole had been dug out of the desert.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully observed his surroundings, but he didn’t find the snail.</p>
<p>Was it absorbed by the Bright Torch Vision World or had it escaped? Zhou Wen didn’t dare be careless as he summoned several important Companion Beasts to prevent any mishaps.</p>
<p>If this lineup still allowed it to escape, it would be terrifying.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon and company stood around Zhou Wen and constantly scanned the nearby desert, but they didn’t find any traces of the snail.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen missed Truth Listener a little. If he had Truth Listener’s ability, he wouldn’t be at such a disadvantage. Now, he had to be more careful.</p>
<p>After waiting for quite some time, the snail still didn’t appear. Zhou Wen felt that it was most likely sucked into Bright Torch Vision World with the bone sand. Otherwise, there was no reason for it not to appear.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t dare be careless. He continued watching carefully. At the same time, he didn’t dare stay in the bone sand desert any longer as he headed straight for the underground sea.</p>
<p>Along the way, he didn’t see the snail reappear. When he arrived at the beach, Zhou Wen didn’t head into the sea. Instead, he watched the sapphire sky from the side. It was a spectacular sight.</p>
<p>An Sheng said that they had people who also wanted to study the sapphire sky, but the Companion Beasts they had sent would die for no reason once they approached it. After losing quite a number of Companion Beasts with no results to speak for, they had to give up exploring the sapphire sky.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at it for a while, but he didn’t find anything in the sapphire sky. The gem-like crystal’s body was entirely blue, looking beautiful and profound.</p>
<p>He attempted to summon a Poison Bat Companion Beast and make it fly towards the sapphire sky.</p>
<p>Back in-game, Zhou Wen had already done similar experiments numerous times. He would only see the Poison Bat flash a faint blue light when it approached the sapphire sky. Then, they would die. He saw nothing else.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen wanted to see it happen in reality, hoping to find some clues.</p>
<p>Indeed, the moment the Poison Bat Companion Beast approached the sapphire sky, a blue light suddenly flashed from its body. In the next second, the Poison Bat’s body turned into a blue transparent crystal. After it exploded into powder, it fell into the underground sea.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked carefully, but he failed to discover where the blue light had shot out from. From his point of view, the blue light appeared to come from within the Poison Bat’s body.</p>
<p>He tried a few more times, but the results were the same. He couldn’t identify the problem.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen felt his neck itch. He reached out to scratch it, but when his fingers touched his skin, it gave him a fright.</p>
<p>When his fingers touched the itchy spot, he found it extremely hard to the touch. It didn’t feel like skin, but rather like jade.</p>
<p>Not good! Zhou Wen thought of something as he hurriedly summoned the crystal mirror and looked at his neck’s reflection. Upon seeing the reflection, his expression changed drastically.</p>
<p>On the right side of his neck, there was a bulge the size of a fingernail. It was very strange. It was neither red nor swollen. It was translucent like jade and had spiral patterns on it. It was like the shell of a snail.</p>
<p>Is this the snail being up to no good? Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen pulled out his Orchid Blade and slashed at his neck, slicing off the jade-like flesh.</p>
<p>Seeing that the flesh under his skin remained tender flesh and blood, he felt a lot more at ease that it hadn’t turned to jade.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen directly used the Orchid Blade to shatter the sliced piece of flesh. At the same time, he summoned the Fire Furnace Queen and burned it to ashes.</p>
<p>Although the wound on his neck still hurt, it didn’t itch. Zhou Wen felt much better.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s current physical strength, the tiny wound quickly contracted and stopped bleeding. It wouldn’t take long to heal itself.</p>
<p>However, after a while, Zhou Wen felt his wound itch again. He thought that it was the itch from the scab, but when his fingers touched it, his expression immediately turned ugly.</p>
<p>He picked up the crystal mirror and took a look. The wound had completely healed, but a snail shell had protruded out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately cut it off and summoned Doctor Darkness to inject large amounts of poison into his wound.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body’s poison resistance was already very high, so the poison couldn’t take his life. He wanted to see if it was effective on the wound or rather, be effective on the snail-like lump.</p>
<p>However, he was disappointed. Despite injecting him with a large amount of poison, making him almost unable to take it, it didn’t take long for the wound to automatically heal, producing a spiral-shaped jade lump. A strange itch also triggered Zhou Wen’s nerves, making him have the urge to grab it.</p>
<p>I’m in big trouble. Zhou Wen knew that things were rather serious. It was definitely the snail’s doing, but he didn’t even know where the snail was. It was unknown when the snail had attacked him.</p>
<p>He switched to Zero Taboo and used all sorts of methods to deal with the jade lump, but it was to no avail. No matter how he tried, the jade lump would regrow and become itchier. It made Zhou Wen have the urge to chop off his neck.</p>
<p>Damn it. Truth Listener is still evolving. Otherwise, its Evil Nullification Life Soul might be useful. Zhou Wen felt his neck itch more and more as he clenched his fists. However, he didn’t dare grab it. He was afraid that the more he scratched at it, the worse it would become.</p>
<h3 id='chapter575'>Chapter 575 Cultivation of Small Perfection of Wisdom</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that he couldn’t delay any further. He had to think of a way to resolve this problem.</p>
<p>Perhaps The Thearch knows what it is. Zhou Wen wanted to leave the Zhuolu battlefield and return to the encampment to contact The Thearch to see if he could obtain any useful information regarding the snail from her.</p>
<p>However, after taking a few steps, Zhou Wen felt his neck itch to the point of being unbearable. He wished he could slice off his neck.</p>
<p>What was even stranger was that Zhou Wen felt his body become heavier as though an invisible boulder was pressing down on him. Every step he took felt extremely difficult. He left deep footprints on the bone sand as his calf sank into it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that it wasn’t an illusion. There really was something pressing down on him. He could clearly sense the pressure, but there was nothing on him.</p>
<p>Plop!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body was pressed into the bone sand. He struggled to stand up, but he couldn’t move.</p>
<p>Not only could he not move, but his neck was getting itchier. He couldn’t even scratch it.</p>
<p>I have to leave this place as soon as possible. Zhou Wen got Six-Winged and Torch Dragon to pull his body back.</p>
<p>However, even with Six-Winged and Torch Dragon’s immense strength, they were unable to move him. Or rather, they didn’t dare use too much strength, afraid that they would directly snap his body.</p>
<p>Indeed, I’m not suited to enter a dimensional zone in real life. Something happens every time. Zhou Wen was beginning to regret digging around.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because he had just obtained a powerful Companion Beast like Torch Dragon that it had gone to his head. He believed that with Torch Dragon around, he could deal with any unexpected situation, but he never expected to have no chance of using it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only endure the itch and let Torch Dragon burrow beneath the bone sand to prop him up from above.</p>
<p>However, when Torch Dragon tried to prop up Zhou Wen’s body with all its might, it nearly flattened Zhou Wen. It still failed to lift his body up even a centimeter.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was pressed down on Torch Dragon’s back. As Torch Dragon retreated, Zhou Wen immediately fell into the sandpit, incapable of moving.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had thought of all the solutions he could, but they were useless. He was trapped there, unable to move.</p>
<p>The pressure on his body was secondary. The itch on his neck was unbearable. It was so itchy that it nearly reached deep into his soul.</p>
<p>All his strength was useless. All Zhou Wen could do was switch to the Small Perfection of Wisdom and circulate the Eight Perfections Wisdom Life Providence.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that the power of the Small Perfection of Wisdom could reduce the pressure on him, nor was it that the Eight Perfections Wisdom could stop the itch. Instead, the Small Perfection of Wisdom had one benefit—it had a high tolerance.</p>
<p>Daoists cultivated life as it was, while Buddhists cultivated their future incarnation. They pursued the great release of the future.</p>
<p>Although Small Perfection of Wisdom was an Essence Energy Art that cultivated his constitution, it was different from the Invincible Connate Divine Art that directly strengthened one’s body. Small Perfection of Wisdom focused on the mind’s management of one’s body.</p>
<p>The Six Perfections Wisdom had all sorts of wisdoms that allowed one to pursue an epiphany mentally without being limited by one’s body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t circulate the Small Perfection of Wisdom to relieve the pain on his body, but to prevent himself from focusing on his pain. He hoped to reduce the itchiness by employing this method.</p>
<p>Although this method didn’t treat the root of the problem, Zhou Wen really didn’t have a better solution. If he didn’t stop the itch, he was afraid that he would go crazy.</p>
<p>If I don’t have Truth Listener with me, I will not touch anything randomly in the future, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>After the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra circulated, the Eight Perfections Wisdom made his six senses sharp. It made the itch go deeper into his bones.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that this was only temporary. He had read quite a number of Buddhist scriptures, so he knew that this was an inevitable process. He needed to first experience pain before he could fully gain enlightenment and achieve the liberation of his body.</p>
<p>Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva had once said that one cannot become a Buddha with hell empty. It was a form of great enlightenment and liberation.</p>
<p>Resisting the almost lethal itch, Zhou Wen constantly circulated the Small Perfection of Wisdom, hoping to achieve a great liberation of his mind. At the same time, he had absolute control over his body, preventing it from being limited by his six senses and circumstances.</p>
<p>If it were an ordinary person, they wouldn’t be able to calm down and think about the meaning behind the scriptures when suffering from such an itch. They wouldn’t be able to fully focus on circulating the Essence Energy Art.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was clearly not an average person. His talent at focusing allowed him to think and gain insights without being affected.</p>
<p>The scriptures he had read previously weren’t for nothing. Zhou Wen had taken the right path. With the circulation and comprehension of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, Zhou Wen’s senses became sharper. The itch on his neck still existed, but the mental effects on Zhou Wen decreased significantly. It made him feel less uncomfortable.</p>
<p>This is indeed feasible! Zhou Wen continued studying from this angle, hoping to break through the Small Perfection of Wisdom’s bottleneck and condense a Life Soul.</p>
<p>Unlike ordinary Essence Energy Arts that strengthened one’s constitution, the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra could not eliminate the pain in one’s body. Instead, it used one’s wisdom to understand the pain.</p>
<p>Of course, being able to understand something didn’t mean that he could resolve it. However, the separation of his body and mind made Zhou Wen feel less pain.</p>
<p>The pressure on him remained as the itch grew more intense. However, despite clearly sensing the pain, Zhou Wen felt that his body wasn’t his. The pain wasn’t that unbearable anymore.</p>
<p>This feeling was very odd. It was clearly his body, but it didn’t feel like it belonged to him. His mind seemed to be taking on an outsider’s view.</p>
<p>If this continues, will I really become a Buddha? Zhou Wen could sense that his body was emitting a treasure glow.</p>
<p>And the source of this treasure glow was not from his physical body, but deeper.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wish to become a Buddha without any desires, but in this situation, he could only continue cultivating. Otherwise, just the itch would drive him crazy.</p>
<p>In such an environment, Zhou Wen quickly separated his mind and body. It sounded contradictory, but it was indeed Zhou Wen’s present state.</p>
<p>It could control his body while his mind wasn’t restrained by his body. The pain from the pressure and itch was already nothing to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, even if Zhou Wen was no longer fazed by it, nor had it affected his mind, the pressure on his body still existed. His body had already been pressed into the bone sand and was about to be flattened.</p>
<p>With his body dead, it was useless no matter how powerful his mind was. Wouldn’t he just be waiting for Buddha to take him into Paradise? Zhou Wen clearly didn’t follow this belief.</p>
<h3 id='chapter576'>Chapter 576 Hell King</h3>
<p>What should I do? If Small Perfection of Wisdom can’t resolve my predicament, it’s akin to drinking poison to quench my thirst. Zhou Wen racked his brains, hoping to find a complete solution.</p>
<p>Although the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra and the Eight Perfections Wisdom couldn’t free Zhou Wen from the pain, it made his mind and six senses sharper. He could observe the details he couldn’t sense before.</p>
<p>His neck protruded. Even without looking in the mirror, Zhou Wen could sense everything that was happening, including the details beneath his skin.</p>
<p>Under the effects of the Eight Perfections Wisdom, Zhou Wen felt as though his body had turned transparent. It allowed him to see many physical details through his consciousness, or it could be said that he could sense the minute parts of his body. That wasn’t a true vision.</p>
<p>This should be the seventh sense mentioned in the Buddhist scriptures, right? Zhou Wen could clearly sense that the spiral jade beneath his neck wasn’t as simple as a lump.</p>
<p>Beneath the lump, there were many invisible silk objects that penetrated his blood vessels and muscles. As they were too minute, one couldn’t see them with the naked eye.</p>
<p>The silk-like objects seeped into his body like a spiderweb and coiled around his flesh and bones. His entire neck was enrooted by the silk as it spread throughout his body. Even his brain was penetrated.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen finally knew why it was useless to slice off the lump. As the saying went, if one didn’t remove the roots when cutting grass, the grass would grow again once the spring wind blew.</p>
<p>He needed to get rid of the threads inside to truly resolve the danger.</p>
<p>However, the power of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra and the Eight Perfections of Wisdom could let him see the problem, but not resolve it.</p>
<p>Such a force that directly penetrated his body made formidable powers like Torch Dragon useless. Unless Zhou Wen wanted to be killed by the Bright Torch Vision World, he could only come up with another solution.</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness was the best in this area, but even his poison couldn’t destroy the fine threads. This showed how powerful this thing was.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I still have the Substitute Talisman on me. Furthermore, I still have the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. If I have no choice, I’ll perish together with this strange snail. With the Substitute Talisman and the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, I should be able to survive. It might not be the case for the snail, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>However, that was the final step. As long as there was a way, Zhou Wen didn’t want to take that final step.</p>
<p>Since the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra can let me see it, is there really no way to resolve it? Furthermore, my comprehension still hasn’t allowed the Small Perfection of Wisdom to advance to the Epic stage or condense a Life Soul. Clearly, it’s because my comprehension isn’t completely correct… Zhou Wen tried hard to meditate.</p>
<p>The treasure glow on his body became more and more crystalline. However, due to the immense pressure, his body was almost unable to withstand it. His bones creaked from the pressure as though they would snap at any moment.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could sense a huge snail shell pressing down on him. It couldn’t be seen with the naked eye or touched, but the pressure existed. It was extremely odd.</p>
<p>Since my mind can’t control my body, why don’t I do the opposite? If I can’t even live this life, what’s the point of a future incarnation? With a thought, Zhou Wen reversed the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally believed that reversing the Small Perfection of Wisdom would definitely damage his body, but he soon realized that after the Small Perfection of Wisdom was reversed, it could also smoothly circulate without any obstruction. It was as though it should have been that way from the start.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart suddenly stirred as he thought of the three-faced Buddha in Small Buddha Temple. The three-faced Buddha had three faces, but they weren’t all smiling benevolently. They were somewhat different from ordinary Buddha statues.</p>
<p>Could it be that the… Small Perfection of Wisdom isn’t a pure Buddhist Essence Energy Art… One body with three sides… Then what’s the last side? Zhou Wen seemed to figure out something.</p>
<p>As the Small Perfection of Wisdom reversed, the Eight Perfections Wisdom also changed. Zhou Wen, who was originally in a state of separating his mind and body, once again fused his mind and body.</p>
<p>The extremely itchy feeling immediately returned to Zhou Wen, making him nearly go crazy.</p>
<p>However, almost at the same time, this crazy itch made Zhou Wen feel like he was brimming with strength. The more painful and itchy his body was, the more mentally sharp he became. Not only did he not feel the pain, but he also felt a sense of pleasure, as though he wanted to tear apart everything.</p>
<p>Humans have three sides. One side is Buddha, the other side is the devil. When Buddha arrives, I will be Buddha. When the devil arrives, I will be a devil. When Buddha and the devil are not present, I am my true self…</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen constantly gained insights, his essence, vitality, and spirit, as well as his Life Providence, erupted with terrifying power. It made his body glow and emit a shocking treasure glow, as though an indescribable power was building up in his body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t unfamiliar with this power. It was the condensation of a Life Soul.</p>
<p>However, it was different from the previous times when he condensed a Life Soul. This Life Soul was not an incorporeal object in the consciousness like Zero Taboo, nor was it a corporeal entity like Lost Country. It also wasn’t an independent entity like the Inverse Ancient Sovereign.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Life Soul seemed to be his body—his body being the Life Soul. It was probably unprecedented.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>As his Life Soul condensed, the jade lump on Zhou Wen’s neck cracked. Wisps of invisible threads peeled out from his body.</p>
<p>It was as though invisible transparent strands of hair had automatically crawled out from his body. However, it wasn’t that the silk that had crawled out by itself. It was because of a strange change in Zhou Wen’s body that prevented any external object from attaching to him. Therefore, the threads had no choice but to leave his body.</p>
<p>The threads separated from Zhou Wen’s body and gathered together. Soon, they transformed into a transparent snail with a milky-white shell on its back. It was the same snail that Zhou Wen had dug out from the rhinoceros’ stomach.</p>
<p>Its tiny eyes sized up the glowing Zhou Wen as though it was pondering over something. However, when it looked at Torch Dragon beside it, it ultimately bowed its head and burrowed into the bone sand. It seemed to be invisible as it disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Wen’s body, it had already turned crystalline, like jade. He looked like a mighty being, as though he was nurturing an immense amount of energy. A vertical eye appeared at his glabella. At the instant the vertical eye opened, it was as though a door to the endless hell had opened. Countless vengeful and ferocious ghosts roared in it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen himself seemed to have become a demon king as he emitted a terrifying aura of death.</p>
<p>Little Perfection of Wisdom had finally condensed a Life Soul, but this Life Soul looked somewhat odd.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen dispelled his Life Soul and returned to his normal state. The bulge on his neck had vanished, and the pressure on him had vanished. At the same time, he came to realize something.</p>
<p>“Hell King?” Zhou Wen muttered to himself as he read out the name of the Life Soul.</p>
<h3 id='chapter577'>Chapter 577 The Thearch“s Drug</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen had naturally sensed the snail’s departure, but he didn’t chase after it.</p>
<p>The Hell King Life Soul could only prevent the tiny threads from clinging onto his body, but if the snail unleashed its strength, it could still destroy Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>The snail’s retreat without fighting Zhou Wen wasn’t due to the Hell King Life Soul.</p>
<p>Although the Hell King Life Soul was good at strengthening his body, even Torch Dragon and Six-Winged’s attacks couldn’t injure the snail. Zhou Wen didn’t believe that the Hell King Life Soul could really threaten it, so he was still somewhat puzzled when the snail retreated.</p>
<p>However, no matter what, he had finally resolved a huge problem. Zhou Wen quickly left the bone sand desert, not daring to stay any longer.</p>
<p>He used his phone to look at his information and realized that the postfix—Guilt—of his Constitution had vanished. The Life Soul that Small Perfection of Wisdom had condensed was also Hell King. It had the effect of strengthening his mind and body, but this wasn’t the most important ability. The strongest aspect of the Hell King Life Soul was turning the body into a Life Soul. Zhou Wen didn’t know what use it had, for now, so he could only slowly study it.</p>
<p>After returning to the temple, Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief when he didn’t see the snail appear.</p>
<p>I should just game in the future. Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to give up. He lay in the tent and launched the game before heading to the bone sand desert to get Torch Dragon and Six-Winged to continue digging.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed. He didn’t find the fossilized rhinoceros in-game, neither did he find the snail. He only found a few bones.</p>
<p>There’s no snail in-game? Zhou Wen spent two days searching the bone sand desert, but he still failed to find the snail or encounter any other danger.</p>
<p>As for treasures, he found nothing.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The hidden forces An Sheng had set up, failed to capture Qu Qingyun. It was unknown if Qu Qingyun had covered his tracks well or if he had already used some method to escape the ruins.</p>
<p>An Sheng didn’t have the time to be stationed here. All he could do was send someone to guard the ruins and bring Zhou Wen back to Luoyang.</p>
<p>On the way, Zhou Wen used his phone to check the Internet. Indeed, just as An Sheng had said, the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s ranking had dropped to fifth place. There were already 37 Companion Beasts on the rankings. There were a few more than what An Sheng had said.</p>
<p>Should I get Torch Dragon on the rankings as well? Zhou Wen had been pondering over this question.</p>
<p>Beep! Beep! A message was sent by The Thearch.</p>
<p>“I have a gift for you. Accept it with the Void Flower.” Zhou Wen immediately had an ominous feeling when he read the message.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen refused to believe that The Thearch would take the initiative to deliver something good to him.</p>
<p>“I’m driving now. The Void Flower isn’t with me. What gift did you send me?” Zhou Wen probed.</p>
<p>“It’s a world-shaking invention that I came up with. You lucked out,” The Thearch replied.</p>
<p>What shocking invention? Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief. If it was just an experimental product made of chemicals, Zhou Wen felt that it couldn’t be too dangerous.</p>
<p>“You’ll know when you get back.” The Thearch kept him guessing.</p>
<p>After returning to school, Zhou Wen took out the Void Flower pot from the chaos space. The Void Flower couldn’t open a portal in the chaos space; therefore, when Zhou Wen took it out, a portal appeared on the flower. Something floated out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a careful look and saw that it was a glass bottle. It was one of the items he had bought for The Thearch. It wasn’t dangerous, so he reached out to catch it.</p>
<p>Inside the glass bottle was half a bottle of purple liquid. It was unknown what it was.</p>
<p>He didn’t know what the purple liquid was, but Zhou Wen definitely didn’t dare use it. Just as he was about to put it into the chaos space, he received a message from The Thearch.</p>
<p>“Have you received it? Let your Companion Beast drink it. Then, it’s time to witness a miracle.”</p>
<p>No matter how Zhou Wen looked at it, The Thearch’s tone was like a scammer online.</p>
<p>However, since it wasn’t for him to drink, Zhou Wen didn’t mind. It didn’t matter if he gave it a try. After all, he had plenty of Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>After randomly summoning a Chi and letting it drink The Thearch’s medicine, Zhou Wen stared at it with widened eyes.</p>
<p>According to what Zhou Wen knew, ordinary chemicals didn’t have much use for Companion Beasts. Instead, they had a certain effect on dimensional creatures that could make them mutate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Companion Beasts were pure energy bodies, so their composition was relatively stable. The possibility of mutation was very low, so chemicals were useless.</p>
<p>However, after the Chi drank the medicine, its body seemed to be dyed purple—the same color as the drug. Its body also rapidly transformed as it underwent a significant change.</p>
<p>After the transformation ended, its body hadn’t appeared to have undergone many changes. Even the purple color faded.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a look at its stats and realized that its stats had greatly increased. It had gained another skill, making it one of the best at the Epic stage.</p>
<p>Ignoring the increase in stats, it had actually allowed the Chi to comprehend a new skill. It went from two skills to three skills; a shocking feat.</p>
<p>“Thearch, what drug did you give me?” Zhou Wen sent a message to The Thearch.</p>
<p>“The Pet Skill Insights Agent I invented can stimulate the potential of a Companion Beast, allowing it to comprehend a hidden talent ability. The effects aren’t bad, right? I’m guessing you didn’t dare give it to your Six-Winged and Truth Listener. Instead, you let an ordinary Companion Beast drink it. Are you regretting it now?” The Thearch seemed to see through Zhou Wen’s thoughts. It was as though she had seen Zhou Wen’s actions with her own eyes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that The Thearch was deliberately trying to see his regret by not mentioning the effects of the drug in the beginning. Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t let her wish come true.</p>
<p>“Who knows if your drug is really useful. Perhaps it’s only effective on low-level Companion Beasts and useless for high-level ones?” Zhou Wen deliberately said.</p>
<p>“Goading me on is useless. You’re too old-fashioned. If you want a Pet Skill Insights Agent, you have to exchange it with something.” The Thearch’s words were filled with contempt.</p>
<p>“No thanks then,” Zhou Wen immediately replied.</p>
<p>Who knew if The Thearch’s medicine had any side effects. Zhou Wen found it unreliable no matter how he thought about it. How could ordinary chemicals allow a Companion Beast to gain insights into a skill? It was highly likely that she had added something else.</p>
<p>“It’s fine if you don’t want the Pet Skill Insights Agent, but you have to return me the items.” The Thearch directly sent a list.</p>
<p>“How much Pet Skill Insights Agent can these items get?” Since he couldn’t reject it, he naturally had to try his best to benefit himself.</p>
<p>“One bottle,” The Thearch replied.</p>
<p>“At least ten bottles. I was the one who bought all the ingredients you used to make the drug, right? It’s not worth that much money.” Zhou Wen deliberately said this to know if The Thearch had added anything else.</p>
<p>However, The Thearch didn’t answer him. “Two bottles. It’s up to you whether you want them or not, but you have to buy and deliver everything on the list in a month.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter578'>Chapter 578 Nine-Headed Pheasant Spiri</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the list. The items The Thearch wanted this time weren’t very expensive. They were all relatively common items. Most of them were electronic products. He had no idea why she wanted them.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen was in Chess Mountain, many electronic devices couldn’t be switched on, much less get any reception. Occasionally, he would switch on the phone only to have it crash with a black screen.</p>
<p>The Thearch clearly had a way to resolve these problems, but it was unknown how she did it.</p>
<p>Now that I have Torch Dragon, I might be able to explore Deer Terrace Pavilion. Even if I can’t get anything to drop, storming my way in to see what’s inside would be good too. Zhou Wen decided to head to Deer Terrace Pavilion in-game.</p>
<p>After getting Li Xuan to help get someone to buy the items on the list, Zhou Wen entered Chess Mountain’s instance dungeon and headed for Deer Terrace Pavilion.</p>
<p>With the Demon God Catalog, Zhou Wen successfully ascended the Deer Terrace Pavilion. However, he didn’t sneak up this time. Instead, he summoned Six-Winged and Torch Dragon to kill all the fake fairies and immortals.</p>
<p>After the fake fairies and immortals were killed, they revealed their true forms—foxes, night cats, rats, and wolves. Killing them wasn’t difficult.</p>
<p>With the two pets leading the way, Zhou Wen soon arrived at the ancient building on the Deer Terrace Pavilion. He could see six male and female immortals drinking and enjoying themselves inside the ancient building.</p>
<p>One of them was the fake fairy who had chased after Zhou Wen last time. When she saw Six-Winged and Torch Dragon, the six fake immortals inside were alarmed. However, Zhou Wen didn’t give them a chance. Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World opened and instantly reflected all six fake immortals into it, instantly killing them.</p>
<p>The phone indicated that he had killed the Mythical Creature, Fox Demon, but unfortunately, they were all pulled into the Vision World. Even if something dropped, it would be impossible to get it out of the Vision World.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t too concerned about this. After killing six Mythical fake immortals, he circled the first level without finding anything valuable.</p>
<p>He headed for the second level of the ancient building through the stairs. Upon reaching the second level, he saw a colorfully dressed fairy sitting in the hall.</p>
<p>The fairy looked extremely beautiful, but she wasn’t as otherworldly as an immortal. Instead, she was just extremely beautiful.</p>
<p>When the fairy saw Torch Dragon and Six-Winged, her expression changed. She flicked her sleeve and flew up. At the instant she flicked her sleeve, she let out a cry as a terrifying sound wave blasted out.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon and Six-Winged could still withstand her sound blasts, but the blood-colored avatar’s body wasn’t that strong. It was shattered by it.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar didn’t die, but the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon died in its place. However, the sound blast didn’t stop. Unable to escape death, the game screen turned black.</p>
<p>Indeed, I have to launch a preemptive attack. Zhou Wen entered the game again and charged up Deer Terrace Pavilion. He slew six fox demons on the first level and rushed to the second level.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen didn’t give the colorful-robed fairy any chance. He got Torch Dragon to use the Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>The colorful-robed fairy turned into a colorful giant bird. It looked like a colorful phoenix, but there were nine heads on its neck.</p>
<p>The nine-headed phoenix flapped its wings and flew out as though it had teleported, avoiding Torch Dragon’s gaze. Its speed was much faster than Zhou Wen’s peak speed.</p>
<p>Seeing the giant, nine-colored, phoenix-like bird about to cry out again, Zhou Wen ordered Torch Dragon to use World King Transformation as he charged down the second level’s exit and returned to the first level.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen heard a sound wave blast down from the second level, the sound came to a halt as his phone gave a notification.</p>
<p>‘Killed Mythical creature, Nine-Headed Pheasant Spirit.’</p>
<p>The notification was very simple, and there weren’t any indications of dimensional crystals. It was probably stored in the Vision World.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sent the blood-colored avatar back up to the second level and indeed, he realized that the Nine-Headed Pheasant Spirit was gone. Only the weak Torch Dragon was lying on the ground. Clearly, it was draining for it to use the World King Transformation.</p>
<p>This building has a total of three levels. The second level is the Nine-Headed Pheasant Spirit. Could the third level be the legendary Demon Consort? Zhou Wen really wanted to head to the third level to take a look.</p>
<p>However, Torch Dragon was too weak. Without Torch Dragon, Zhou Wen couldn’t even defeat the Nine-Headed Pheasant Spirit, much less the Demon Consort.</p>
<p>Could The Thearch be that Demon Consort? Zhou Wen guessed inwardly.</p>
<p>Instead of continuing upstairs, he logged out of the game. Zhou Wen planned on heading to the top of Deer Terrace Pavilion after Torch Dragon recovered.</p>
<p>He first went to other dungeons to grind all sorts of rare dimensional creatures. Just as he was grinding Medusa, his phone suddenly rang.</p>
<p>He took a look at the number and saw that it was an unknown number. It continuously rang a few times before Zhou Wen picked up the call.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, how have you been recently?” A clear and gentle voice came from the phone.</p>
<p>“Jiang Yan…” Zhou Wen nearly jumped up.</p>
<p>Ever since they separated at Holy City, Zhou Wen had not heard of Jiang Yan again. He never expected Jiang Yan to suddenly call him.</p>
<p>“I’ll wait for you at the same old place,” Jiang Yan said before hanging up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew where Jiang Yan was referring to. Unable to hold himself back, he went out and headed for Dragon Gate Grotto.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen arrived at the former laboratory in Old Dragon Cave, he saw Jiang Yan sitting on a stone slab. He was looking at Zhou Wen with a harmless smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company had used the stone slab as a table to eat and play cards. When he saw Jiang Yan sitting there, he couldn’t help but recall the times they had spent here.</p>
<p>“Senior…” Zhou Wen called out, but he didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>Ask him if he was doing well? That was nonsense. How could he be living well while being pursued by the bureau?</p>
<p>Ask him what he had been doing recently? Zhou Wen felt that he shouldn’t ask. That would put Jiang Yan in a difficult position.</p>
<p>If Jiang Yan answered him, he would expose his past whereabouts. If he didn’t answer, it would hurt his feelings.</p>
<p>However, Jiang Yan didn’t seem to mind. He sized up Zhou Wen and said with a smile, “From the looks of it, you have been doing pretty well recently. Your strength has improved greatly. It seems like you have more than one Mythical Companion Beast.”</p>
<p>“Can you tell?” Zhou Wen asked Jiang Yan in surprise.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan probably didn’t know that he had the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon and Torch Dragon; yet, he was able to tell that he had more than one Mythical pet. If everyone could tell, he wouldn’t have any secrets to speak off.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. There aren’t many humans like me who can tell that you have Mythical Companion Beasts. Besides, I can’t tell what your Mythical Companion Beasts are,” Jiang Yan said with a smile as though he had seen through Zhou Wen’s thoughts.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief when he heard Jiang Yan say that.</p>
<p>“I was trying to come up with a solution for a problem I have, but since you already have such strength, help me,” Jiang Yan continued.</p>
<h3 id='chapter579'>Chapter 579 Speedy Solar Lunar Shuttle</h3>
<p>“What help do you need?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I’m going to a dimensional zone to do something and need help. There’s a Mythical creature guarding the area and it’s rather powerful. However, with your help, it shouldn’t be difficult to deal with it,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen agreed.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to ask which dimensional zone I’m going to?” Jiang Yan said with a smile.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. No matter which dimensional zone it is, I’ll accompany you.” Zhou Wen shook his head.</p>
<p>“Alright, go back and prepare. See you here tomorrow morning,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>“I don’t have anything to prepare. I can go with you now.” Zhou Wen brought everything he needed with him, so there was nothing to prepare.</p>
<p>“Let’s do it tomorrow. I don’t know if I’ll be able to come back in the future. I want to stay here for the night,” Jiang Yan said as he looked at the dilapidated laboratory.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else and returned to his dorm.</p>
<p>The next morning, Zhou Wen arrived at Old Dragon Cave again and saw a strange beast carriage in the laboratory.</p>
<p>The carriage looked ancient. Even the wheels were made of bronze. The carriage’s box wasn’t sealed with a baldachin over it. Pulling in front of it were two giant rabbits—one black, one white.</p>
<p>The rabbis were even bigger than an ordinary horse. They were almost the same size as an elephant. They sprawled on the ground, their bodies connected to the reins.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan was already in the carriage. When he saw Zhou Wen walk over, he waved at him. “Ah Wen, get in.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it too ostentatious to drive this carriage out?” Zhou Wen got into the carriage and asked uneasily.</p>
<p>If they were to drive this carriage out of Old Dragon Cave, it would definitely attract the attention of countless people, even onlookers.</p>
<p>“No.” Jiang Yan was very certain. He held a whip and whipped the two giant rabbits.</p>
<p>The two giant rabbits immediately began moving. They moved quickly, and finally, Zhou Wen understood what it meant to start a hare.</p>
<p>The two giant rabbits charged forward like arrows with the carriage in tow.</p>
<p>However, there was a cave wall in front of them. Just as the two giant rabbits were about to slam into the mountain wall, Zhou Wen almost jumped off the carriage to prevent himself from dying in the collision.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen ultimately held back the urge to jump. He knew that Jiang Yan wasn’t such a rash person.</p>
<p>Indeed, the black and white giant rabbits slammed into the mountain wall, but the mountain wall didn’t seem to exist. They pulled the beast carriage and charged in.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched the black and white giant rabbits pulling the beast carriage forward quickly. Streams of light rushed ahead of him and to his side, as though they had entered a spacetime tunnel. He couldn’t see anything around him at all. There were distorted beams of light everywhere.</p>
<p>“What carriage is this?” Zhou Wen could tell that the beast carriage was extraordinary as he looked at Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>“Speedy Solar Lunar Shuttle.” Jiang Yan continued when he saw that Zhou Wen was still in a daze, “The two rabbits pulling the carriage are Day, and the other is Night. When they are together, they can produce the ability to shuttle through space. Although they aren’t strong enough to reverse the flow of time, they can cross space and travel great distances in an instant. It’s best to travel with them.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed when he heard that. The two rabbits were definitely at the Mythical stage. Otherwise, it would be impossible for them to have such powers.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had long felt that Jiang Yan wasn’t a simple person, he was still somewhat surprised that he had obtained such a Speedy Solar Lunar Shuttle.</p>
<p>After a while, the Speedy Solar Lunar Shuttle stopped.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked out of the carriage and realized that he wasn’t anywhere near Dragon Gate Grotto. He wasn’t even in Luoyang. There were towering mountain peaks that pierced through the clouds everywhere. There were no signs of humans. There were primitive forests everywhere, and the air was so clean and fresh that it felt sweet.</p>
<p>“We must walk on our own for the rest of the journey. Even Day and Night won’t be able to go up.” Jiang Yan alighted the carriage and released the reins. The two rabbits flashed and escaped.</p>
<p>“Aren’t they your Companion Beasts?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan shook his head and said, “No, I only temporarily invited them to pull the carriage. They aren’t Companion Beasts.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression turned odd again. To be able to invite wild dimensional creatures to pull carriages wasn’t something an ordinary person could do.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan pointed at the mountain that went straight into the clouds and said, “We have to climb to the top of this mountain. However, this mountain is extraordinary. When we climb it later, we can only advance and not retreat. Under no circumstances are you to retreat. Otherwise, you will be doomed.”</p>
<p>“Why is that?” Zhou Wen asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>“This mountain is called Immortal Seeking. Legend has it that immortals live at the top of the mountain. Anyone who wishes to become an immortal can be reborn as an immortal if they can climb to the top of the mountain. Although this is only a legend, this mountain is indeed different. It has a terrifying taboo protecting it. Once someone steps into this mountain, they will definitely die if they take a step back. There’s no reason. That’s the rule of this mountain,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>I wonder if my Zero Taboo can restrain the taboo of Immortal Seeking Mountain. Zhou Wen thought to himself, but he didn’t plan on trying. All he did was look around the foot of the mountain, hoping to see if there was a tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he didn’t see one. All he saw was a stone staircase spiraling up the mountain. It was like a heavenly staircase that pierced through the clouds, with no end in sight.</p>
<p>“There are many obstacles along the way, but with your willpower, I believe there won’t be any problems. Just remember that you can’t retreat,” Jiang Yan said as he stepped onto the stone steps.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed him. Just as he stepped onto the stone steps, he immediately felt an invisible force tugging at his body. His body sank slightly as he nearly fell onto the stone steps.</p>
<p>With every step Zhou Wen took to climb the stairs, he felt like he was carrying a mountain. After taking a few steps, his clothes were almost drenched in sweat.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan was no different. He could see that his hair was drenched in sweat.</p>
<p>The power on the stone steps was very strange. It didn’t constantly grow stronger, nor would it constantly weaken. This power was just right to reach the limits of Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>In other words, Zhou Wen had to use all his strength to take every step.</p>
<p>After taking a few steps, Zhou Wen felt that he had expended a lot of his strength, but the power on the stone steps seemed to possess intelligence. It would also weaken relatively, but the effort Zhou Wen needed to walk was maintained at maximum.</p>
<p>The first step was the limit. If it was someone with a weak will, their will would quickly collapse and they would have the intention to retreat.</p>
<p>However, Jiang Yan had said that they absolutely could not retreat. Retreat meant certain death.</p>
<h3 id='chapter580'>Chapter 580 Immortal Seeking Path</h3>
<p>They trudged up the mountain step by step. Although they could continue walking no matter how tired they were, seeing the stone steps that seemed to have no end threw one into despair.</p>
<p>As Jiang Yan walked in front, he said, “The ancients believe that there are immortals in the sky. Only by meeting immortals on high ground can one obtain the Great Dao’s heritage. Therefore, since ancient times, the East, West, South, and North Districts have myths regarding the Ascension. For example, in the fairy tales of the West District that we are more familiar with, a young man planted magic beans that ended up growing high into the sky. Then, he climbed up the beanstalk to a giant castle in the sky. There’s also the Foundational Tree legend of our East District.”</p>
<p>“Those are plants. It doesn’t seem to have anything to do with mountains, right?” Zhou Wen added.</p>
<p>“There are mountains too. Don’t many deities in myths and legends live on the mountain? Like the gods of Mount Olympus, the Immortal Palace on Kunlun Mountain, and Mount Buzhou that connects the heavens and earth,” Jiang Yan said as he walked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Jiang Yan chatted not because they wanted to conclude anything, but it was a way to kill time. The mountain was just too tall. They had to do their best with every step and they couldn’t walk fast. They did not know when they would finish climbing. It was really boring.</p>
<p>Furthermore, speaking could also eliminate some negative emotions, making one feel less despair.</p>
<p>“I wonder if these legendary things have corresponding dimensional zones? If there are, I really want to get a few magic beans to plant one. Then, I’ll take a visit to the giant castle in the sky. I want to know if there’s really a goose that can lay golden eggs and the beautiful girl trapped in the cage,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure if there are any magic beans, but I’ve seen the Fusang divine tree of the three divine trees overseas,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>“Is there really a Fusang divine tree? Are there really ten Sun Golden Crows on that tree?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if there are Sun Golden Crows, but that tree grows in the sea. It’s so high that it’s unreachable. It’s covered in sun-like fruits. Just a glance from afar is enough to blind one. No human can approach it.” Jiang Yan paused before continuing, “It’s said that in ancient times, Hou Yi shot down nine suns while standing on the Fusang divine tree. If the legend is true, Hou Yi would definitely be the strongest among humans today.”</p>
<p>“If Hou Yi really exists, doesn’t that mean that the mighty figures in myths like Zhurong, Gonggong, and Kuafu exist as well? If we can also draw a bow and shoot down the sun in the future, drinking a river dry with a mouthful, and destroying a mountain with a single strike, that would be amazing…” Zhou Wen was somewhat excited when he thought of the scene.</p>
<p>“Why wait? If your Mythical pet is an offensive type, it shouldn’t be a problem to slice off a small mountain,” Jiang Yan said with a smile.</p>
<p>“It’s possible, but it’s just a tiny mountain. Even if it’s sliced off, it would be meaningless. At the very least, it should be able to split five famous peaks into two or slice off the entire Mount Everest,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“It’s probably impossible for an ordinary Mythical stage to reach that level,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>As the two of them climbed up the mountain, they chatted, their stamina draining in the meantime. They panted heavily every few steps. Their clothes were drenched, as though they had just been scooped out of the water.</p>
<p>“What are you going to the mountaintop for? Don’t tell me you want to become an immortal?” Zhou Wen joked.</p>
<p>“I really want to seek immortality,” Jiang Yan said seriously.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he asked in disbelief, “Seek immortality? Aren’t the so-called immortals dimensional creatures?”</p>
<p>“Not entirely. On this mountain peak, there’s a cocoon. The creature inside the cocoon can be said to be a dimensional creature, but it’s not completely one,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>“Guardian?” Zhou Wen exclaimed.</p>
<p>“I’m surprised you know about Guardians. That makes it easy to explain things. That’s right. Although there aren’t any immortals on this mountaintop, there’s a Guardian. My goal is that Guardian, but there’s a terrifying Mythical creature guarding it. I’m not its match alone, so I have to find helpers.” Jiang Yan didn’t seem surprised that Zhou Wen knew about Guardians.</p>
<p>“Why are you looking for a Guardian? Kill it? Or is there another way to use it for yourself?” Zhou Wen was somewhat worried. Could Jiang Yan also know of the Spirit Casting Skill? If he knew it as well, would he be following Wang Mingyuan’s path in his search of a Guardian?</p>
<p>This wasn’t impossible. Before Wang Mingyuan tore out of the realm, he had given his research information and experience to Jiang Yan. Perhaps the Spirit Casting Skill was included.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid we won’t be able to kill the Guardian with our current strength. However, I’ve studied the information left behind by Teacher. As long as the method is right, we can obtain the Guardian’s loyalty. Since you know about Guardians, you should have read the information, right?” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>“I haven’t seen information about it, but I’ve seen a living Guardian before.” Zhou Wen recounted John and the six-winged seraphim to Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>“Senior Brother, you have to be careful. Those Guardians are probably unreliable,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan smiled again and said, “What’s absolutely reliable in this world? It’s just like how there are plenty of people who are betrayed by their business partners. There are also quite a number of people who have conflicts. Don’t tell me that one can’t earn money by not doing business? Everyone is just acting in their self-interests. Even blood relatives like parents and brothers can turn against each other and become enemies. Don’t treat the Guardian as personal property and treat them as a partner. That way, it won’t be so difficult to accept certain developments.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. Jiang Yan’s words weren’t without reason, but Zhou Wen didn’t plan on choosing that path because he had too many secrets he couldn’t let others know.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan continued, “Since this is a path to break past the Epic stage, be it right or wrong, someone has to pass it before we know. I’ll try it first.”</p>
<p>The two of them chatted as they walked and exchanged some information regarding Guardians.</p>
<p>According to Jiang Yan, there was indeed an azure silk cocoon on the mountaintop. The Guardian inside might be more compatible with his cultivation attributes and he might have a chance of contracting the Guardian inside.</p>
<p>However, according to the information left behind by Wang Mingyuan, the most basic condition to form a contract with a Guardian was to defeat the Mythical creature guarding the cocoon. Otherwise, there was no way to approach the cocoon, much less form a contract.</p>
<p>The Mythical creature guarding the azure silk cocoon on the mountaintop was a white guardian beast that resembled a horse or a sheep. It had two horns and vertical eyes. It could speak the human language. Every word it said could become reality.</p>
<p>Previously, when Jiang Yan went up alone, the guardian beast only glanced at him and said “Scram.” Jiang Yan rolled down from the mountain peak, unable to control his body. He nearly died.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan had done a lot of research and guessed that the guardian beast was the legendary Bai Ze.</p>
<h3 id='chapter581'>Chapter 581 Immortal Opportunity Stone</h3>
<p>“It’s impossible for us to kill it with our present strength, but I have a way to stall it.” Jiang Yan shared his thoughts.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan had an Epic Companion Beast known as Soundless Snake. It could block sounds from spreading within a small region. As long as they couldn’t hear Bai Ze’s voice, the power in its voice wouldn’t be effective.</p>
<p>Then, Jiang Yan prepared a Mythical Dark Domain Heavenly King. It was a Mythical Companion Beast from overseas. It had the ability to transform a certain area into a region of darkness and could restrain all kinds of vision-type abilities.</p>
<p>As long as Bai Ze was in the darkness, its eyes’ abilities would not be effective either.</p>
<p>Without the ability to speak and see, Bai Ze’s strength would greatly decrease. It wouldn’t even be able to see what Jiang Yan was doing.</p>
<p>At that moment, as long as Zhou Wen could hold back Bai Ze and attract its attention, Jiang Yan could take the opportunity to contract the Guardian in the cocoon.</p>
<p>“Is it impossible to use all vision-type skills in the darkness?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Probably so. I haven’t discovered any vision-type abilities that can be used in the region of darkness,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>I wonder if Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World can be used in the region of darkness? Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Their stamina consumption was immense, exhausting the duo. They stopped talking and walked forward without a word.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gave it a try and switched his Life Soul to Zero Taboo. He realized that the strange force acting on him immediately vanished without a trace, making him feel much more relaxed. He couldn’t help but be overjoyed.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen saw the Zero Taboo crystal emit a terrifying glow, as though it wouldn’t last long before it burned to ashes. He knew that the taboo here was no trifling matter.</p>
<p>He hurriedly deactivated Zero Taboo. The strange force exerted on Zhou Wen again, tormenting him with every step he took.</p>
<p>Although Zero Taboo is useful, it’s only in its Primordial Body form. It can only last for a very short period of time. If I can advance to a Perfect Body, I might really be able to use Zero Taboo. It might even be able to restrain all kinds of taboos in the world, Zhou Wen thought to himself as he wondered how he could raise Zero Taboo to a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>Currently, among Zhou Wen’s Life Soul, only the Inverse Ancient Sovereign was an Evolved Body. The rest were still in their Primordial Body forms, so it was imperative to raise their levels.</p>
<p>The Zero Taboo is used to restrain the taboos of various mysterious lands. Doesn’t that mean that as long as I have some understanding of those mysterious taboos, I can raise Zero Taboo? Zhou Wen didn’t know if this conjecture was right, but there was nothing wrong with trying it.</p>
<p>It just so happened that the taboo power of Immortal Seeking Mountain was extremely powerful. Zhou Wen had nothing else to do, so he decided to study it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen switched his Essence Energy Art to Small Perfection of Wisdom. Under the effects of the Eight Perfections Wisdom Life Providence, his senses became extremely sharp, allowing him to sense the taboo powers of Immortal Seeking Mountain.</p>
<p>If the Eight Perfections Wisdom couldn’t resist the taboo powers, Zhou Wen only wanted to make his senses sharper to better understand the effects of the taboo power.</p>
<p>The taboo power of Immortal Seeking Mountain was indeed very strange. This kind of power didn’t harm others. It matched the person’s strength. It just happened to be at the peak that one could withstand. Every step one took required them to use all their strength. One couldn’t hesitate or their legs might go limp and end up falling down the mountain.</p>
<p>Although the path to becoming an immortal was difficult, as long as one’s willpower was firm, it wasn’t a dead end. However, this path seemed to have no end. Every step one took was extremely difficult. Even a person with a firm will would inevitably show signs of weakness over time. Therefore, very few people could reach the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt the changes in the power in his body and found it strange and unpredictable.</p>
<p>If I take a step back, what changes will this taboo power have? Just as this thought surfaced in Zhou Wen’s mind, he immediately nipped it in the bud.</p>
<p>Goods of every variety are nothing compared to the value of survival. I definitely can’t take risks. Zhou Wen hurriedly steeled his resolve and continued walking forward.</p>
<p>When the sun was about to set, the two of them had only managed to climb around a thousand meters. When they looked up, they still couldn’t see the end to the path. The stone steps circled around the clouds like a coiling dragon. Just one look made them feel a little dizzy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was just about to take out a bottle of water to hydrate himself when he heard Jiang Yan say, “We’re reaching the Immortal Opportunity Stone ahead. You have to be careful after crossing it. If you continue walking up, there will be something that will try to entice you. You have to remember that no matter what happens, you mustn’t retreat or you will die.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that it wasn’t easy to deal with things that Jiang Yan said with such seriousness, so he asked, “What will happen?”</p>
<p>“That’s hard to say. Everyone’s situation is different. You have to experience it before you know what it is,” Jiang Yan answered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked up and indeed, he saw a small platform beside the mountain path. On it was a huge boulder with the words “Immortal Opportunity.”</p>
<p>However, there was nothing special about the stone. It was exactly the same as the ordinary mountain rocks on Immortal Seeking Mountain. It just had two additional words engraved on it.</p>
<p>Soon, the two of them walked past the Immortal Opportunity Stone and took a few more steps. Zhou Wen didn’t sense anything different from before.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, he saw Jiang Yan suddenly turn and strike at his head. His expression was ferocious as he said coldly, “You’ve been fooled. Die!”</p>
<p>The mountain path was narrow to begin with—it only allowed one person to walk along. Jiang Yan’s palm emitted a resplendent divine light as though a sun had smashed down. Zhou Wen had nowhere to hide. Apart from retreating, he could only take the brunt of Jiang Yan’s palm.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression didn’t change as he continued moving up the stairs. At the same time, he used his arms to shield himself from Jiang Yan’s palm.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen still remembered that Jiang Yan had warned him not to retreat no matter what happened. Furthermore, he believed that Jiang Yan wasn’t such a person.</p>
<p>With Jiang Yan’s character, even if he really wanted to harm him, he would have clearly explained why he was doing so. It was impossible for him to sneak an attack like this.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen continued walking forward without any intention of counterattacking. If it was just an illusion, any counterattack would strike the defenseless Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>Indeed, Jiang Yan’s palm passed through his arm before Jiang Yan’s body dissipated.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked up and saw Jiang Yan walking in front of him. He had never turned his head.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen hadn’t thought things through and allowed his body to automatically counterattack, Jiang Yan would probably have died from his strike.</p>
<p>What crappy immortal opportunity is this? It’s basically luring the demon in one’s heart, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<h3 id='chapter582'>Chapter 582 Different Methods of Death</h3>
<p>Jiang Yan walked in front while Zhou Wen followed behind. He moved up step by step. After passing the Immortal Opportunity Stone, it was another long and arduous journey.</p>
<p>The two of them drank and ate a little occasionally, almost without stopping. Even so, they took four days to reach the mountainside.</p>
<p>In just four days, the two of them had lost quite a bit of weight. Their eyes and cheeks were sunken, making them look like skin and bones.</p>
<p>The two rather handsome lads looked like hunched old men.</p>
<p>This wasn’t their fault. They used all their strength with every step. Their bodies were exhausted and they couldn’t stop to rest. The reason they were able to last until now was because of their extraordinary physiques. If it were an ordinary Epic stage, they probably wouldn’t be able to withstand it even if they didn’t die of exhaustion on the Immortal Seeking path.</p>
<p>Looking up, they still couldn’t see the mountain peak. All they saw was endless stone steps. Looking down, there was fog lingering around, and they couldn’t see anything. In this godforsaken place that prevented them from seeing the sky or the ground, the reason they knew that this was halfway up the mountain was that there was the word ‘Half-Cliff’ engraved on a boulder beside them.</p>
<p>“Once we cross Half-Cliff, we still have halfway more to go. However, it’s even more difficult than the first half of the journey. Can you still hold on? If you can’t hold on, you can rest for a day on Half-Cliff’s platform before turning around and leaving the mountain. You won’t be affected by the taboo of Immortal Seeking Mountain. However, once you reach Half-Cliff’s platform, you can never go up the mountain again,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>“We’re already here. No matter what, we have to go up and take a look. It’s impossible for me to give up halfway. I can still persist. Let’s continue,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“After Half-Cliff, if you continue walking forward, you will see things. When the time comes, no matter what you see, don’t speak or make a sound. Just close your mouth and walk forward, or something bad will happen,” Jiang Yan added.</p>
<p>“No speaking. Got it.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly, but he was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>The taboos on Immortal Seeking Mountain weren’t written anywhere. If Jiang Yan knew about these taboos, someone must have tried them. Otherwise, if it was really as Jiang Yan had said, he would have died if he took a step back. Zhou Wen refused to believe that Jiang Yan wouldn’t retreat without knowing about the taboo.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t dig into it since Jiang Yan didn’t say anything more. He continued walking behind Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>The stone steps on the first half of the mountain were very narrow, but after Half-Cliff, the stone steps became much wider. It was more than enough for two to three people to walk side by side.</p>
<p>But now, the two of them couldn’t speak. If they were to walk side by side, it would be even worse if they accidentally spoke. Therefore, they continued walking one after another without saying a word, like two mutes.</p>
<p>Every step Zhou Wen took made him feel like his legs were trembling. No matter how powerful his Essence Energy Arts and Essence Energy Skills were, they were useless in this godforsaken place. Using external forces to strengthen his body would also increase the strange power. It would still push his body to its limits.</p>
<p>As he walked, Zhou Wen’s gaze accidentally swept across the stone steps in front of him. His pupils constricted as he nearly shouted.</p>
<p>If Jiang Yan hadn’t warned him beforehand, he would definitely have shouted. This was because there was a corpse lying in the stone path above. The corpse’s clothes and looks were identical to Zhou Wen’s.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was puzzled, but he couldn’t say a word. All he could do was continue walking forward as he sized up the corpse by the side of the road. No matter how he looked at it, it was identical to him. However, the corpse had collapsed on the stone steps and wasn’t breathing.</p>
<p>It’s definitely the same as before—an illusion. Zhou Wen stopped looking at the corpse and continued walking upwards.</p>
<p>After walking for a while, he circled around a mountain ridge and saw another corpse on the stone steps ahead.</p>
<p>This time, he saw it even more clearly. It was Zhou Wen’s corpse. What Zhou Wen couldn’t tolerate was that it looked like his corpse but without any clothes covering it. Its limbs were spread wide open as it was nailed to the mountain wall by metal nails. It looked like it had died a tragic death.</p>
<p>Everything is an illusion… Everything is fake… I’ll endure it… Zhou Wen secretly calmed himself down. Although he knew that it was only an illusion, it still infuriated him. The crux of the matter was that the person resembled him too much. Even the marks and scars on his body were identical.</p>
<p>As he walked further up, Zhou Wen saw several different ways of dying. Some were hanged to death, while others were cleaved into two. All the deaths were tragic.</p>
<p>However, he became immune to it after prolonged exposure. Along the way, he saw at least hundreds or thousands of different ways of dying. He was no longer surprised.</p>
<p>After walking for another seven or eight days, when the sun rose again, the two of them finally saw the top of the mountain. There were no buildings there, only a crooked tree of unknown species. The branches extended to the edge of the cliff.</p>
<p>On one of the branches of the crooked tree hung a huge green cocoon. On careful look, they saw that the cocoon wasn’t in contact with the tree branch but was floating.</p>
<p>Beneath the crooked tree was a white beast. It was snow-white and had two horns on its head. There was a vertical eye on its forehead, but the vertical eye was closed. It was likely the Bai Ze that Jiang Yan had speculated.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Jiang Yan walked to the top of the mountain. Bai Ze had definitely discovered them, but it completely ignored them. It continued resting and lying there, completely ignoring them. It didn’t even spare them a glance.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had heard from Jiang Yan that the white beast wouldn’t take the initiative to attack them. This was also one of the main reasons why he had determined that the white beast was Bai Ze.</p>
<p>Bai Ze was a kind-hearted auspicious beast. It was knowledgeable and capable of human speech. It could identify all kinds of supernatural beings. Legend has it that it had been entrusted by Yellow Emperor to create a map of tens of thousands of supernatural beings for humans to easily identify them and avoid danger. It was one of the ancient divine beasts that were good at exorcism.</p>
<p>“Did you see those strange corpses earlier?” Jiang Yan asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Yes, all the corpses looked like me,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“How many were there?” Jiang Yan asked again.</p>
<p>“I don’t remember. There were so many that I didn’t count them. There should be more than a thousand.” Zhou Wen paused and asked Jiang Yan, “Why are you asking this? Aren’t those illusions?”</p>
<p>Jiang Yan looked at Zhou Wen with a strange smile. “A thousand? That’s impressive.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen didn’t understand what Jiang Yan was getting at.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan said with a smile, “Legend has it that the path to immortality is a process of transcending one’s mortal coils. Every corpse illusion you see is a crime you once committed. Only by purging the sins you have committed can you not be killed by the Heavenly Tribulation when you become an immortal. You saw more than a thousand corpses—which means that you have committed more than a thousand crimes.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter583'>Chapter 583 Backup Plan</h3>
<p>“It’s just a legend. It might not be accurate. I think any human will see that many corpses, right?” Zhou Wen naturally didn’t believe this. If it was really the process of transcending one’s mortal coils, why hadn’t he become an immortal considering how he finished the journey?</p>
<p>“I don’t know if it’s accurate, but I know a few people who once walked the Seeking Immortality path. One of them only saw three corpses, with the most being a hundred corpses,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>“Then how many corpses did you see?” Zhou Wen asked Jiang Yan.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan glanced at the path they came from and said indifferently, “I don’t know. I didn’t count. The mountain wall along the way was filled with corpses. It’s like a mountain of corpses. All I saw were corpses, without a single part of the mountain exposed.”</p>
<p>“Then it’s even more unlikely to be right. How many people can a student like us kill? How can there be so much sin?” Zhou Wen looked at Jiang Yan. He actually didn’t believe that Jiang Yan could see so many corpses.</p>
<p>“Follow the plan.” Jiang Yan didn’t say anything else as he walked towards the crooked tree on the mountaintop.</p>
<p>As Jiang Yan walked, he summoned two Companion Beasts. The first was a black python with a mouth the size of a bowl. It was more than ten meters long and its entire body was pitch-black.</p>
<p>Strangely, the snake didn’t have eyes. It kept flicking its tongue.</p>
<p>The other Companion Beast was also black, but it was dressed as a warrior in black armor. It wore a black mask and had two sabers on its back. The scabbard and handle were also black. It was probably the Dark Domain Heavenly King.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare be negligent. He summoned Six-Winged and Golden Battle God Halberd while Torch Dragon appeared in the form of an eye mirror. Unless it was absolutely necessary, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on using Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>Firstly, Bai Ze’s reputation was too terrifying. Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if the Bright Torch Vision World was effective against it. If it didn’t work and ended up provoking it, he would ultimately be the one suffering.</p>
<p>Secondly, Bai Ze didn’t take the initiative to attack others. Previously, when Jiang Yan approached the range of the crooked tree, it had only said “Scram”, causing Jiang Yan to roll down the mountain without killing him.</p>
<p>Only then did Bai Ze look up to glance at him. This glance left Zhou Wen alarmed. It didn’t look at Six-Winged or the Golden Battle God Halberd, but straight into Zhou Wen’s eyes.</p>
<p>Could it have already discovered Torch Dragon? Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhou Wen was already prepared, Jiang Yan immediately ordered the Soundless Snake and the Dark Domain Heavenly King to use their powers.</p>
<p>The Soundless Snake opened its mouth. There were no venomous fangs inside, but visible ripples spread out from the mountaintop.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, the Dark Domain Heavenly King pulled out the two sabers on his back and crossed them. A black light instantly devoured the entire mountain peak like a black hole.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately felt his vision turn pitch-black. With the augmentation of Eight Perfections Wisdom and the Hell King Life Soul, his vision remained pitch-black. He couldn’t see or hear anything.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Truth Listener is still evolving. I wonder if Truth Listener’s ability can break through the Soundless Snake’s Soundless Barrier? As Zhou Wen thought about it, he suddenly felt his eyes light up again. He could see and hear.</p>
<p>However, he could see that the entire mountain was enveloped in black. Furthermore, the sound waves produced spread out like water ripples.</p>
<p>“Let’s begin. Use your Companion Beast to attract Bai Ze’s attention. Don’t really fight it. Just attract its attention. It’s best if it can’t see or hear,” Jiang Yan said as he dived towards the crooked tree.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ordered Six-Winged and Golden Battle God Halberd to surround Bai Ze using a pincer movement. At the same time, he made some noise to attract its attention.</p>
<p>Bai Ze continued lying on a huge rock under the tree, motionless.</p>
<p>Six-Winged and Golden Battle God Halberd lunged from the left and right. One stomped on the ground with its huge feet, leaving huge footprints on the rocks, while the tip of the Golden Battle God Halberd slashed across the ground, leaving a deep mark. Wherever the halberd tip touched the rocks, sparks flew everywhere.</p>
<p>However, due to the Soundless Barrier, their actions failed to produce any sound. Only Zhou Wen and Jiang Yan could hear thanks to the Soundless Snake’s special treatment.</p>
<p>Bai Ze still didn’t react and continued lying there, but Zhou Wen and Jiang Yan felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>If Bai Ze really couldn’t see or hear anything, then it shouldn’t be so calm, right?</p>
<p>Indeed, when the Six-Winged and Golden Battle God Halberd approached the crooked tree, Bai Ze suddenly opened its mouth and spat out a word. “Freeze!”</p>
<p>Then, Six-Winged and Golden Battle God Halberd froze. They stopped there as though someone had pressed a pause button in a movie.</p>
<p>As for the Soundless Snake’s Soundless Barrier, it was instantly torn apart by a force and shattered. As though it had suffered a heavy blow, the Soundless Snake collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s face darkened. The Soundless Barrier was completely useless as it was destroyed by Bai Ze.</p>
<p>What was even more depressing was that the Six-Winged and Golden Battle God Halberd were frozen there. No matter how Zhou Wen commanded them, they remained motionless.</p>
<p>Six-Winged’s eyes could still move, but its expression remained ferocious with its agape mouth, and its body couldn’t move.</p>
<p>The Golden Divine Light at the tip of the Golden Battle God Halberd kept flickering, but the halberd was also unable to move.</p>
<p>Even worse, Zhou Wen and Jiang Yan were also frozen. The Dark Domain Heavenly King couldn’t move either. Although his dark domain remained effective, no one could move. What was the use of the dark domain?</p>
<p>“Sorry, I underestimated Bai Ze’s strength. I originally thought that the Soundless Barrier would last for a while, I never expected it to break in the blink of an eye,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen made an attempt. Although he couldn’t move his body, there was no problem with speaking. “We should have expected this. A famous divine beast like Bai Ze isn’t that easily restrained.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I still have a backup plan,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>“What’s your backup plan? Why didn’t you tell me beforehand?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked when he heard that there was a way to turn the tables.</p>
<p>“There was no need to prepare for the backup plan. You just need to execute it. If I told you in advance, I’m afraid you wouldn’t agree to it,” Jiang Yan said with a strange expression.</p>
<p>“We can’t move now. How do we execute it?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“We can still move if we think of a solution. I’m just not sure if my backup plan will work,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>“What is your backup plan?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I studied many myths and legends, and I eventually came to a conclusion. Bai Ze… might be a clean freak…” Jiang Yan’s expression turned odder.</p>
<p>“So what if it’s a clean freak?” Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss as to what Jiang Yan was up to.</p>
<h3 id='chapter584'>Chapter 584 Bacteria</h3>
<p>“Usually, a clean freak wouldn’t be willing to touch something dirty,” Jiang Yan explained.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was enlightened. “You mean to say that you want us to dirty our bodies? Then, Bai Ze won’t be willing to touch us. You should have said so earlier. This isn’t anything difficult. It would have been better for me to make preparations earlier though. I’d have got some pot-bottom soot before coming…”</p>
<p>“That’s not the case. No matter how dirty our bodies are, it doesn’t matter to Bai Ze. This is because it doesn’t need to touch us at all. It only needs one word to finish us. If we’re dirty, it might attract its annoyance. It could chase us off the mountain, but after seeing how dirty we are, it might just throw us down the cliff to our deaths,” Jiang Yan said as he shook his head.</p>
<p>“Then what do you mean?” Zhou Wen really couldn’t figure out what Jiang Yan meant.</p>
<p>“What I mean is that perhaps we have a way to make Bai Ze unwilling to even look at us or even say a word to us,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>“How is this possible? No matter how dirty we are, it’s impossible for it to not even look at us, right? Even if it doesn’t wish to look at us, it just needs to close its eyes. Then, it can just say a word to make us scram down the mountain.” No matter how Zhou Wen thought about it, it was impossible for something like that to happen.</p>
<p>“Of course it’s possible. As long as you do as I say, you can definitely do it,” Jiang Yan said confidently.</p>
<p>“How?” Zhou Wen asked in disbelief.</p>
<p>“You’ll know when you read this.” Jiang Yan’s glabella shimmered with a purple light. His originally immobile body, like Zhou Wen’s, began moving. Then, he threw a book in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>This only lasted for an instant. After doing all of this, the purple light between Jiang Yan’s eyebrows vanished and his body returned to a frozen state.</p>
<p>“Take a good look at the content of the comic book and you will know what to do,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>Bai Ze clearly had absolute confidence in itself. Although it had heard Zhou Wen and Jiang Yan’s conversation and could understand what they were talking about, it didn’t mind at all. It looked at them as though they were two idiots.</p>
<p>From its point of view, no matter what Zhou Wen and Jiang Yan did, it only needed one word to finish off the two idiots.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t move his body. Thankfully, his mouth could still move. He blew at the comic book on the ground and used the airflow to flip the pages.</p>
<p>This was one of the volumes of a comic book. There was zero context to what was happening, and Zhou Wen didn’t understand what it meant, but after reading for a while, his expression gradually changed.</p>
<p>The content of the comic book looked very normal, as though there was nothing special about it. It was just that the scene did not seem to contain any unbearable content.</p>
<p>Bai Ze lay there and secretly opened its eyes to steal a glance. Seeing that there was nothing wrong with the drawing, it closed its eyes and leisurely continued resting.</p>
<p>“Are you sure this will work?” Zhou Wen asked Jiang Yan with a strange expression after reading it.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan said with certainty, “Definitely.”</p>
<p>“Will Bai Ze kill us if we do this?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“Definitely not. Your blood will only make it feel that it has tainted its territory,” Jiang Yan said.</p>
<p>“Wait, what do you mean by saying that I’ve tainted its territory? Shouldn’t it be us?” Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>“Ah Wen, this matter can only be done by you. I can’t do it,” Jiang Yan said sincerely.</p>
<p>“We are all men. Why can I do it but you can’t?” Zhou Wen immediately retorted. He didn’t believe Jiang Yan’s nonsense.</p>
<p>“Actually, I’m also a clean freak. The severity isn’t any better than Bai Ze’s. That’s why I need your help. Otherwise, I could do it myself. I wouldn’t have to bring you here,” Jiang Yan continued sincerely. “It’s also because I’m a clean freak that I know this method will definitely succeed.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe you! If you want to do it, we do it together. No way I’m doing it myself,” Zhou Wen said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Ah Wen. I’ll make it up to you in the future.” As Jiang Yan spoke, the purple light on his glabella lit up again, allowing him to temporarily escape Bai Ze’s control.</p>
<p>In the next second, Jiang Yan flicked his hand and shot out a piece of paper. It landed right above Zhou Wen’s head.</p>
<p>After doing this, the purple light between Jiang Yan’s eyebrows dimmed again and he became immobile.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? What’s that on my head?” Zhou Wen looked up diagonally, but he couldn’t see anything above his head.</p>
<p>“This is an Epic Companion Beast named Head Paper Figurine. As long as it lands on your head, it can control your body. Then, whatever it does, your body will follow. Don’t worry. The Head Paper Figurine’s control of your body is similar to the control of a puppet. Your body is still fixed, but it doesn’t affect what you are needed to do…”</p>
<p>As Jiang Yan explained, the Head Paper Figurine stood up. It was a paper figurine cut out of yellow paper. It didn’t have a nose or eyes. It was a human-shaped paper figurine.</p>
<p>However, when it stood above Zhou Wen’s head, his originally immobile body began moving like a puppet, but it looked extremely stiff.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’ve already gotten someone to teach it all the actions. It will complete them in one go at the fastest speed possible. Remember to say the lines…” Jiang Yan closed his eyes. He didn’t even want to look at the scene or even imagine it.</p>
<p>“No… No…” Zhou Wen’s eyes widened as he looked down. He watched helplessly as his hand pulled at his pants like lightning.</p>
<p>“Ah Wen, it will be hard on you. I’ll make it up to you in the future.” Jiang Yan closed his eyes with an ashamed expression.</p>
<p>However, all of a sudden, Jiang Yan’s expression changed drastically as he suddenly opened his eyes. His pupils darted sideways, but he didn’t see Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The purple light between Jiang Yan’s eyebrows immediately erupted again, but it was already too late. Zhou Wen appeared behind him, revealing a devil-like smile as he held the Head Paper Figurine with one hand as it constantly struggled. However, it couldn’t escape his palm.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Wen’s other hand, he had already grabbed Jiang Yan’s pants and pulled them down. Then, he flew up and kicked Jiang Yan’s buttocks. Jiang Yan’s pupils immediately constricted as he rolled towards Bai Ze with a look of despair.</p>
<p>“Haha, Brother Bai Ze, take a closer look at the spot that this fellow has rolled over. Those places have already been contaminated by his filthy bacteria… The wind will cause the filthy bacteria to constantly spread… Soon, the entire mountain peak will be covered in dirty bacteria… Make sure you don’t let him scram down the mountain… Wherever he rolls will be tainted by dirty bacteria…” Zhou Wen said smugly when he suddenly saw a purple whip wrap around his leg at some point in time.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Jiang Yan, who was rolling towards Bai Ze, gritted his teeth and pulled. Zhou Wen’s pants ruptured as his body fell to the ground and also rolled towards Bai Ze.</p>
<h3 id='chapter585'>Chapter 585 Fairy Burial</h3>
<p>What was an obsessive-compulsive disorder patient most afraid of? Of course, it wasn’t something that could be seen. Whatever could be seen could be removed. For a patient with a serious obsession with hygiene, as long as something could be removed, it wasn’t a problem. They could spend a lot of time getting rid of it.What they really couldn’t tolerate was the psychological hint.</p>
<p>Just like a clean freak who washed his hands after peeing. Turning on the faucet with his hand, he would feel that it was stained with bacteria from the balls. After washing his hands, his hands would be clean, but if he switched it off, he would be touching the balls’ bacteria on the faucet. Such repeated actions made it impossible to feel completely clean.</p>
<p>Unless it was a faucet that had automatic detection, a patient with a severe obsession with cleanliness could struggle in front of the sink for a long time.</p>
<p>Now, two sources of the balls’ dirty bacteria were rapidly rolling on the mountaintop. They tainted wherever they rolled with balls’ dirty bacteria.</p>
<p>If Bai Ze said “scram” now, the two huge sources of infection would continue rolling down the mountain, infecting the entire mountain.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen hadn’t said the sentence, Bai Ze probably wouldn’t have thought too much into it. However, after Zhou Wen’s psychological cue, Bai Ze felt that no solution was appropriate to deal with the two dirty fellows.</p>
<p>He wanted to fix the two of them in place, but for some reason, it was useless against them.</p>
<p>Kill them? Bai Ze only felt that it would contaminate the entire mountain peak. Furthermore, it wasn’t a creature that could easily kill.</p>
<p>Now, Bai Ze didn’t even want to look at the two dirty sources of infection. It was as if it would be infected by the balls’ dirty bacteria if it looked at them.</p>
<p>Retreat! Slowly retreat!</p>
<p>An existence as powerful as Bai Ze was actually retreating.</p>
<p>We’re about to succeed… Zhou Wen was delighted when he saw that he and Jiang Yan were about to roll to the side of the crooked tree.</p>
<p>Although this move was rather despicable and shameless, it was good as long as it could achieve its goal. There was no one else here to see their sorry state, so there was no need to worry too much about it.</p>
<p>The only hateful thing was that Jiang Yan could clearly use this method himself, but he had dragged him over.</p>
<p>It took longer to describe, but it only took an instant for Zhou Wen to kick Jiang Yan to the point of the duo slamming into the crooked tree. The frightened Bai Ze failed to react in such a short period of time. It retreated from the mountaintop with a look of horror and contempt, as though it had all been contaminated by them.</p>
<p>When he slammed into the tree, Zhou Wen had already summoned the Jade Crystal Spirit Armor and put it on. At the same time, he shouted at Jiang Yan, “Senior Brother Jiang, don’t put your clothes on. Otherwise, Bai Ze will definitely charge over when he sees you wearing your clothes. You won’t have the chance to contract the Guardian. You mustn’t fail.”</p>
<p>Jiang Yan wasn’t willing to listen to him. He was even faster than Zhou Wen. He had already summoned his armor and put it on. His first reaction wasn’t to pounce at the black cocoon but to smack away the dirt on himself.</p>
<p>This fellow is really obsessed with hygiene… Zhou Wen immediately rushed over when he saw Jiang Yan’s actions. He kicked him away and sent him flying towards the cocoon.</p>
<p>“Senior Brother, I’ll help you…” Zhou Wen shouted at Jiang Yan who had flown out.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan slammed into the cocoon like a cannonball. He held back the extreme discomfort in his heart and the urge to clean his body. He bit the tip of his tongue and spat out a mouthful of blood on the azure silk cocoon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched as Jiang Yan’s blood slowly seeped into the cocoon. This was the first time he had seen someone contract a Guardian. He didn’t know if Jiang Yan’s method would succeed.</p>
<p>Bai Ze stood above a sea of clouds and saw that Jiang Yan’s blood had already fused into the cocoon. The expression on its face was abnormally complicated. It didn’t move. It just stood there, looking at the azure silk cocoon.</p>
<p>The azure silk cocoon absorbed Jiang Yan’s blood. There wasn’t much blood, but it quickly dyed the huge azure silk cocoon completely red before cracks began to appear on it. Pieces of the cocoon that were wrapped in silk fell off.</p>
<p>Azure light shot out from the openings; they looked extremely pure.</p>
<p>As the cocoon constantly shattered, Zhou Wen saw a curled body inside the cocoon. However, it was different from what Zhou Wen had imagined.</p>
<p>It was an azure-robed fairy with fluttering clothes. She didn’t share any characteristics with Bai Ze.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that the creatures inside the cocoon were typically related to the dimensional creatures protecting them. Just like the one in Ant City, she had some characteristics of an ant.</p>
<p>As for John’s six-winged seraphim, he had heard that the Mythical creature guarding the cathedral was an angel.</p>
<p>However, he had used a trick to circle around the angel and formed a contract with the six-winged seraphim. He had never really fought the angel.</p>
<p>Under that situation, John hadn’t truly obtained the six-winged seraphim’s recognition. Now that Jiang Yan had used a trick, Zhou Wen was worried that he wouldn’t be able to obtain the true recognition of the Guardian. It would be terrifying if he had to pay a certain price to contract the Guardian.</p>
<p>Could this guardian also be from the Association of Eunuchs? An indescribable scene flashed across Zhou Wen’s mind as he looked at Jiang Yan with a strange expression.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was in thought, the cocoon had completely shattered. Azure vines appeared out of thin air and circled around the azure fairy.</p>
<p>When the azure vines transformed into beams of light that resembled dragons that rose into the sky, they shattered and fell, turning into flower petals that filled the sky.</p>
<p>The azure-robed fairy actually turned pink amidst the petals. The petals that filled the sky danced as the fairy moved.</p>
<p>The fairy’s gaze was calm as she walked to Jiang Yan with the flower petals. She extended her hand and said to him, “My name is Fairy Burial. Are you willing to let me become your Guardian and fight with you?”</p>
<p>“I am,” Jiang Yan answered seriously.</p>
<p>“As you wish.” Fairy Burial’s palm pressed on Jiang Yan’s forehead. At the point of contact, a pink light spread out.</p>
<p>At that instant, Fairy Burial’s body transformed into countless petals that surged towards Jiang Yan, condensing into a floral armor that completely enveloped Jiang Yan’s body.</p>
<p>As more and more petals gathered on the armor, the original pink color turned red. The red gradually turned dark red before turning purple. When all the petals fused into the floral armor, the armor turned dark purple. It looked strange, yet gorgeous.</p>
<p>The floral armor looked extremely beautiful as though it was a perfect piece of art, but for some reason, Zhou Wen seemed to sense the aura of a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood from the gorgeous armor. It left him horrified.</p>
<p>As the floral armor fused with Jiang Yan’s body, an unimaginable power erupted from him. This power was no longer at the Epic stage. It was shocking.</p>
<p>The Thearch is right. The Guardian’s power can indeed allow humans to enter the Mythical stage. However, this advancement is mainly due to the Guardian armor, not the human itself, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<h3 id='chapter586'>Chapter 586 Two Ways to Advance to the Mythical Stage</h3>
<p>“Sorry for disturbing,” Jiang Yan, who was wearing floral armor, cupped his fists towards the clouds where Bai Ze was.Bai Ze’s eyes drooped as though it was pondering over something. A moment later, it glanced at Jiang Yan and Zhou Wen before turning around and disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>“Senior Brother, congratulations on obtaining the Guardian as you wished.” Zhou Wen hurriedly went forward to congratulate him.</p>
<p>“Do you think I’ll forgive you just like that? What you did to me was unforgivable…” Jiang Yan stared at Zhou Wen as the corners of his mouth gradually curled up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen cursed inwardly before turning to run down the mountain.</p>
<p>However, it was already too late. Jiang Yan’s finger streaked across the void and a flower that resembled a rose appeared between his fingers. The blood-red flower was beautiful.</p>
<p>“Sixth Sacrifice of the Fairy Burial!” With Jiang Yan’s voice, the flower flew out and instantly vanished.</p>
<p>When the flower appeared again, it was already stuck in Zhou Wen’s hair. It stood straight as though it was a lone flower growing above a grave.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately found himself immobilized as though he was a dead person. Not only was his body unable to move, but even his heart and breathing came to a stop. He collapsed flat on the ground.</p>
<p>Although his bodily functions had completely stopped, he was still conscious and could sense everything around him.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan’s fingers moved slightly as the flower in Zhou Wen’s hair tilted slightly. Zhou Wen opened his eyes and could move his mouth, but his body remained motionless.</p>
<p>“Senior Brother, stop fooling around…” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“How can you call this fooling around? I’m doing this to thank you for your help…” Jiang Yan said through gritted teeth as he kicked Zhou Wen’s ass.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen returned to school, it was already half a month since he had left campus.</p>
<p>After Jiang Yan obtained a Guardian, his strength had indeed become very powerful. This strength was somewhat different from having a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Companion Beasts were ultimately external forces, preventing them from truly improving their basic stats and bodily functions.</p>
<p>However, the armor transformed from a Guardian could fuse with one’s body to a certain extent. It allowed a human’s body to possess the attributes and characteristics of the Guardian. This was a fundamental improvement that directly pushed one into the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>However, this improvement was limited to times when fused with the Guardian armor. After separating from the Guardian armor, Jiang Yan would still be at the Epic stage. His body hadn’t advanced to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>However, Jiang Yan was indeed very strong when he wore the Guardian armor. The Guardian had Essence Energy Skills, Life Providence, Life Soul, and Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>With a Guardian, it was equivalent to having an additional Mythical body.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan used all sorts of powerful powers in a way far stronger than when John used the six-winged seraphim. It was unknown if the Fairy Burial was stronger than the six-winged seraphim, or was it because Jiang Yan was stronger than John, or perhaps both.</p>
<p>This left Zhou Wen somewhat tempted, but he quickly rejected this idea. Unless he was at his wits’ end, he wouldn’t be willing to take the path of contracting a Guardian.</p>
<p>Even if there was really no way out, he still had the method of Spirit Casting to try. However, Spirit Casting seemed to be harder and more dangerous than contracting a Guardian.</p>
<p>From what Zhou Wen knew, there were only two paths for humans to advance to the Mythical stage. He had never heard of anyone advancing to the Mythical stage purely with their bodies.</p>
<p>I should first raise my Life Soul to the Perfect Body. Perhaps there will be a solution when the time comes. Unless it’s absolutely necessary, it’s best I don’t take those two paths. This trip to Immortal Seeking Mountain gave Zhou Wen some ideas.</p>
<p>He could definitely use the mysterious taboo power in the dimensional zone to train his Zero Taboo Life Soul.</p>
<p>However, since he couldn’t find the tiny palm symbol on the Immortal Seeking Mountain, Zhou Wen couldn’t run to Immortal Seeking Mountain himself. Therefore, he planned on giving it a try at Small Buddha Temple.</p>
<p>After entering the game, he switched to the Zero Taboo Life Soul. Without using Blood Meditation, the blood-colored avatar ascended the stone steps of Small Buddha Temple.</p>
<p>As expected, Zero Taboo lit up. However, it wasn’t as terrifying as the other places. It was still within the acceptable range.</p>
<p>As Small Buddha Temple’s forbidden power ate into him, Zero Taboo became brighter and brighter as though it was about to ignite.</p>
<p>This level of taboo power was still within the limits of Life Soul’s tolerance. It was like steel that was undergoing tempering in a furnace. Although burning could reduce the crystal’s size, it also became purer.</p>
<p>It’s indeed useful… Zhou Wen was overjoyed. Zero Taboo could be said to be an excellent life-saving ability. In the future, when he headed to various mysterious dimensional zones, he would definitely encounter unimaginable taboo powers. When that happened, he would have to rely on Zero Taboo to save his life.</p>
<p>If Zero Taboo could be upgraded to a Perfect Body, it would undoubtedly be extremely useful to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen felt that it was a little too slow to raise Zero Taboo that way. Furthermore, staying in-game at Small Buddha Temple prevented him from farming monsters.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen decided to head to Small Buddha Temple in real life to train his Zero Taboo Life Soul. At the same time, he could use his phone to farm monsters. This meant that neither action delayed the other.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was about to pack his things and head to Small Buddha Temple when he heard the doorbell ring.</p>
<p>When he opened the door, he saw Wang Lu bringing the chick and antelope over. When Zhou Wen wasn’t around, the two of them would run to Wang Lu. Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered to pick them up.</p>
<p>“I’ll return Little Feifei and Little Yangyang to you. You have to take good care of them in the future. Don’t just leave them in the dorm,” Wang Lu said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Got it,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>Wang Lu bit her lip and said, “I’m leaving.”</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. When he snapped to his senses, he said, “Didn’t your uncle agree to let you stay in school to study? Did he go back on his word?”</p>
<p>Wang Lu shook her head and said, “That’s not the case. I’m about to advance to the Epic stage, so I have to return.”</p>
<p>“What does advancing to the Epic stage have to do with returning?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>“The Essence Energy Art I cultivate is different from others. Every advancement will result in a regression. After I advance to the Epic stage, I will return to the Mortal stage for a while. Only by cultivating back to the Epic stage can it be stable. During this period of time, my body will be prone to injury. Therefore, Father wants me to return home to advance to the Epic stage,” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>“So that’s how it is. Then you really should return.” Zhou Wen felt that it was too troublesome for Wang Lu to cultivate this Essence Energy Art. However, the might of such a troublesome Essence Energy Art definitely was extraordinary.</p>
<p>As though it understood Wang Lu’s intention to leave, the antelope walked to her side. The chick also flew to her shoulder as though it was unwilling to part with her.</p>
<p>Wang Lu hugged the chick and stroked the antelope’s head. She said with a smile, “If you can’t bear to part with me, come home with me. After all, your master doesn’t care much about you. I don’t know how much hardship you will suffer if you follow him.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter587'>Chapter 587 Little Buddha Temple“s Chance Encounter</h3>
<p>Wang Lu had only jokingly asked. Even if the chick and antelope really followed her, she couldn’t take Zhou Wen’s pets away.</p>
<p>After rearing the chick and antelope for so long, how could she not know that the origins of these two dimensional creatures were extraordinary?</p>
<p>However, just as Wang Lu asked that, the chick that was extremely affectionate to her flapped its wings and flew back to Zhou Wen. It turned its face to the side as though it didn’t know her.</p>
<p>Although the antelope wasn’t that heartless, it had no intention of following her. It slowly walked back to Zhou Wen’s side.</p>
<p>“How infuriating. The pet follows after its owner. They are all heartless cheats. They only know how to scrounge for free food and drink.” Wang Lu angrily pointed at the chick and said, “I dote on you the most. I give you everything that’s good. You little cheat…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised as well. The antelope following him could be reasoned away as having other motives, but he never expected the chick to be so determined.</p>
<p>This fellow was usually very close to Wang Lu and despised Zhou Wen. He never expected it to stand on Zhou Wen’s side at such a critical moment.</p>
<p>“When are you leaving?” Zhou Wen asked Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“Someone will pick me up tonight,” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>“I’ll inform the students in the club to wave you off,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. I don’t like parting scenes.” Wang Lu shook her head slightly before looking at Zhou Wen and saying, “You still owe me a lot of food. I’ve recorded all of it in a notebook. How are you going to repay me?”</p>
<p>“Can I get a discount?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Of course not.” Wang Lu glared at him.</p>
<p>“Then what do you want me to do?” Zhou Wen said as he spread out his hands.</p>
<p>“Just remember this debt.” Wang Lu put away her notebook and turned around to walk out of Four Seasons Garden. After taking a few steps, she stopped and said to Zhou Wen with her back facing him, “If you can’t stand staying in the An family in the future, remember to look for me in the capital. You can work while paying me back.”</p>
<p>With that said, Wang Lu left Four Seasons Garden along the small trail.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched her leave and was somewhat puzzled. He originally imagined that the four years in college would be relatively safe, but fate was just so unpredictable with people he was familiar with leaving one by one.</p>
<p>I hope there’s still a chance to meet again. Zhou Wen really wasn’t sure if he could see Wang Lu again. Once the dimensional zones’ restrictions failed, the roads between the major cities would definitely be cut off. To go from Luoyang to the capital would probably be difficult.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, without strength in the future, there was probably nothing one could do. They might not even have the chance to live, so Zhou Wen wanted to raise his strength quickly.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to become an existence like Wang Mingyuan or contract a Guardian. He wanted to see if he could forge his own path.</p>
<p>Can humans definitely not advance to the Mythical stage with their bodies? Zhou Wen didn’t believe that it was set in stone. Since humans could advance to the Legendary and Epic stage, why couldn’t they advance to the Mythical stage?</p>
<p>He went all the way to Small Buddha Temple. This was a restricted zone that prevented outsiders from approaching. However, Zhou Wen had An Sheng’s pass, so he wasn’t barred from entering.</p>
<p>According to what Zhou Wen knew, there were two Mythical Companion Eggs in Small Buddha Temple. However, no one had managed to master the Small Perfection of Wisdom, so no one had been able to take them away.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo had set this place as a forbidden zone, preventing outsiders from getting close. It was also because he didn’t wish for any enemy faction to master the Small Perfection of Wisdom and obtain the benefits.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked up the stone steps in front of Small Buddha Temple and the Zero Taboo Life Soul immediately lit up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked all the way to Small Buddha Temple. He originally planned on finding a place to sit down and game, but just as he entered Small Buddha Temple, he saw a person standing in the yard.</p>
<p>Although he could only see her back, Zhou Wen still recognized her.</p>
<p>Why is An Jing here? Zhou Wen frowned slightly when he saw her back.</p>
<p>An Jing was standing in front of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra’s stone monument, reading the scriptures. When she sensed someone approaching, she turned her head and saw Zhou Wen. She also frowned slightly.</p>
<p>Ever since the coldness in An Jing’s body was melted by Zhou Wen, An Jing hadn’t suffered a relapse again. Her cultivation level had also advanced by leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>In terms of talent, as siblings, An Jing’s talent wasn’t inferior to An Tianzuo’s. However, her congenital ailment made her progress slow when she cultivated the Sun Strafe Art. Otherwise, her achievements would have far exceeded what it was now.</p>
<p>Now that she did not have relapses, An Jing began to seek a breakthrough to the Epic stage.</p>
<p>The Sun Strafe Art was extreme Yang. It was an Essence Energy Art that focused on combat. To figure out its profundity and condense a Life Soul, she had to constantly challenge herself and surpass herself.</p>
<p>This challenge wasn’t only limited to the cultivation of her body, but it also required the cultivation of her mind and will. She had been in Small Buddha Temple for many days to see the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra stone monument. It wasn’t to cultivate the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra but to use it to train herself.</p>
<p>This training method was very dangerous. If she didn’t control it well, it might cause irreparable damage to her body and mind. However, An Jing was confident that she could control herself.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Zhou Wen, An Jing felt mixed emotions. She was originally angry that Zhou Wen had taken away her qualifications. She had always believed that he was far inferior to her. She even felt that Ouyang Lan was biased, so she had thrashed him. Instead of saying that she was targeting Zhou Wen, it was better to say that she was displeased with Ouyang Lan.</p>
<p>However, what happened after that exceeded An Jing’s expectations. Zhou Wen’s repeated achievements made her look at him in a different light. In just a year, he had advanced from the Mortal stage to the Epic stage, surpassing her in terms of level. He had even accidentally removed her ailment.</p>
<p>Although An Jing didn’t pay much attention to the Sunset Army, she was still a member of the An family. She would still get wind of Zhou Wen’s matters, so she couldn’t help but secretly pay attention to him.</p>
<p>However, many of the rumors regarding Zhou Wen left An Jing in disbelief. She couldn’t believe that Zhou Wen had done those shocking things. She felt as though she had been left behind by him.</p>
<p>If it were anyone else, they might have blamed themselves. They would blame it on the qualifications that originally belonged to her, only to have them taken away by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, An Jing was clearly not such a person. Therefore, she worked harder to become stronger. She believed that even without the qualification, she was still better than Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and An Jing had nothing to say. Since An Jing was here, he decided to enter the temple hall. That way they wouldn’t affect each other.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen already had Truth Listener on him, he didn’t trigger the power of the three-faced Buddha when he entered the temple hall again.</p>
<p>After finding a place to sit, Zhou Wen took out his phone to game.</p>
<p>Although he could get the blood-colored avatar to come to Small Buddha Temple to double the cultivation effects, Zhou Wen didn’t think it was necessary. He still had to grind dungeons and farm the rare dimensional creatures daily.</p>
<h3 id='chapter588'>Chapter 588 Ending the Grudge</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen gamed in the temple hall and didn’t pay much attention to An Jing.</p>
<p>However, An Jing couldn’t ignore Zhou Wen. Although he was inside the temple hall and An Jing couldn’t see him, she had a nagging feeling that there was a pair of eyes looking at her.</p>
<p>I’m not inferior to you. An Jing forced herself to focus and continued reading the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because of the catfish effect. Ever since Zhou Wen had come, An Jing felt that she could persist even more. Her improvement seemed to be faster.</p>
<p>In the past, An Jing would feel that her body and mind had reached their limits after reading the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra for an hour. She could hardly withstand any longer.</p>
<p>However, for some reason—perhaps because she felt that Zhou Wen was watching her from inside—An Jing could now last for an hour and a half. She felt that she hadn’t reached her limit.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no idea that he had such an effect on her. He leaned against a pillar in the temple hall and gamed.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar entered Deer Terrace Pavilion again. The fake immortals on the first two levels had been eliminated. Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to ascend to the highest third level.</p>
<p>Could The Thearch be on the third level? If she’s really here, I can find her weakness in-game. Once I can defeat her, I can teach her a lesson in reality. Zhou Wen was somewhat excited. After getting the blood-colored avatar to ascend to the third level, he quickly sized up the situation inside.</p>
<p>It was similar to the second level. There was only one dimensional creature on the third level. It was a cold, white-robed female immortal sitting on a throne.</p>
<p>Could she be The Thearch? Zhou Wen guessed but didn’t waste any time. He directly ordered Torch Dragon to use the Bright Torch Vision World and look at the white-robed female immortal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also stared at the white-robed female immortal. She waved her hand and a white jade lute appeared in her arms. She strummed the strings with her five fingers and immediately produced a terrifying sound wave.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen was prepared by using the Demon Dragon True Body, but he was still sent flying by the sound wave. He spat out blood and slammed into the stone pillar in the hall.</p>
<p>However, almost at the same time, the white-robed female immortal was pulled into Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World. A notification of the death of a Jade Lute Spirit appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>So it’s a Jade Lute Spirit. It’s not Demon Consort! Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already seen the first two of the legendary three demons of Xuan Yuan—Nine-Headed Pheasant Spirit, Jade Lute Spirit, and Nine-Tailed Fox, but there was no sign of the Nine-Tailed Fox.</p>
<p>Although a Nine-Tailed Fox’s phantom image would appear when flying towards Deer Terrace Pavilion from the sky, it was only a phantom, not the real body. The Bright Torch Vision World could only act on physical bodies, so it was useless against the phantom.</p>
<p>He made the blood-colored avatar search the third level. Logically speaking, Deer Terrace Pavilion wasn’t that simple. Furthermore, he was certain that the Jade Lute Spirit was definitely not The Thearch.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen searched the three levels of the ancient building thoroughly several times, but he didn’t find anything. There weren’t any dimensional crystals, much less treasure.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the true secrets of Deer Terrace Pavilion should be underground, but where’s the entrance? There’s no hole in-game. How can I enter? Zhou Wen had attempted to use Torch Dragon to attack Deer Terrace Pavilion, but it seemed to have some mysterious power protecting it. Even the Bright Torch Vision World couldn’t break through it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen circled the Deer Terrace Pavilion countless times, but he failed to find the underground entrance.</p>
<p>Since he couldn’t find the entrance, Zhou Wen had no choice but to temporarily give up and continue grinding other dungeons. At the same time, he trained his Zero Taboo Life Soul in Small Buddha Temple.</p>
<p>For the next few days, Zhou Wen spent most of his time in Small Buddha Temple. Every time he came, he would see An Jing staring at the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra stone monument.</p>
<p>One day, Zhou Wen was grinding when he suddenly saw a bright glow from the yard. The light shone in from the door of the temple hall, illuminating the interior.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned slightly and walked out to take a look. He saw An Jing standing in front of the stone monument, emitting wisps of light. A sun-like projection condensed on her body.</p>
<p>The projection looked somewhat similar to the Ancient Sovereign that Zhou Wen had condensed. They were both light-based projections with an anthropomorphic character.</p>
<p>The difference was that the Ancient Sovereign was a pure human-shaped projection. As for An Jing’s projection, it looked like it was holding a bow made of light. Furthermore, the projection looked more feminine. It wasn’t as brawny as the Ancient Sovereign and was slightly slimmer.</p>
<p>The Sun Strafe Art is indeed somewhat similar to the Ancient Sovereign Sutra, but the difference is still there. Zhou Wen watched for a while and was about to return to the temple to continue grinding when An Jing stopped him.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, it’s time to settle our grudge,” An Jing said as she stared at him.</p>
<p>“Is there anything between us that needs to be resolved?” Zhou Wen turned around and asked An Jing.</p>
<p>An Jing’s eyes narrowed slightly. “I once defeated you. Don’t you want to beat me?”</p>
<p>“I’ve never treated you as my opponent.” Zhou Wen shook his head slightly and prepared to return to the temple hall.</p>
<p>“Stop.” Zhou Wen’s words stirred An Jing’s fighting spirit. Her Life Soul fused with her body, causing her body to emit a sun-like glow. A bow condensed from light appeared in her hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s words could be understood as never treating An Jing as an enemy, but it could also be understood as he had never thought much of An Jing. An Jing clearly believed that Zhou Wen was referring to the latter.</p>
<p>She pulled open the Light Bow in her hand and pointed at Zhou Wen’s back as she continued, “Take this arrow from me. After which, the grudge between us will be written off.”</p>
<p>Just as An Jing said that, she suddenly felt her vision blur. Zhou Wen’s body emitted light that was even more dazzling than the light on her body. As for him, he was already in front of her. His sun-like fist was about to strike her face.</p>
<p>An Jing gritted her teeth and retreated, raising her bow to block.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>An Jing was sent flying with her bow and arrow by Zhou Wen’s punch. Like a cannonball, she traversed more than ten meters and slammed into the temple’s courtyard wall.</p>
<p>Wah!</p>
<p>She spat out a mouthful of blood as the light on her body dimmed and she fell to the ground.</p>
<p>“As you wish. Don’t bother me again in the future.” Zhou Wen really wasn’t in the mood to play such childish games with An Jing.</p>
<p>After returning to the temple hall, Zhou Wen continued grinding. An Jing sat on the ground in a daze, motionless for quite some time.</p>
<p>She still remembered that she had defeated Zhou Wen with one strike, but now, she couldn’t even withstand a single punch from him.</p>
<p>After a long while, An Jing wiped the blood from the corner of her mouth and stood up. Her eyes gradually turned resolute as she glanced in the direction of the temple hall before turning to head out of Small Buddha Temple.</p>
<p>I have to defeat you. Although her goal was the same as before, An Jing’s attitude was completely different.</p>
<h3 id='chapter589'>Chapter 589 Do You Want to Become a God?</h3>
<p>Luoyang, An family.</p>
<p>“Brother, I wish to join the military,” An Jing came in front of An Tianzuo and said firmly.</p>
<p>“Why?” An Tianzuo asked.</p>
<p>“I’ve already advanced to the Epic stage. What I can learn in school is very limited. I need a place where I can improve faster.”</p>
<p>An Jing hesitated for a moment before saying, “I know this will put you in a difficult position. Mom will definitely not agree, but you will help me, right, Brother?”</p>
<p>“Have you really thought it through? The military isn’t a school. Although it also deals with dimensional zones, those unknown dimensional zones will be hundreds or thousands of times more dangerous than the dimensional zones you’ve come into contact with before,” An Tianzuo stared at An Jing and asked sternly.</p>
<p>“I’ve thought it through,” An Jing answered seriously.</p>
<p>“Alright, you are my precious sister after all.” An Tianzuo stood up and patted An Jing’s head. He said with a smile, “Tell me, where do you want to be deployed?”</p>
<p>“Chess Mountain,” An Jing answered.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo’s expression changed slightly. “Why choose that?”</p>
<p>“Because it’s the most dangerous place,” An Jing answered.</p>
<p>“You can go anywhere other than Chess Mountain.” An Tianzuo firmly rejected An Jing.</p>
<p>“Apart from Chess Mountain, I’m not going anywhere else.” An Jing looked at An Tianzuo without backing down.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo’s gaze softened. He could be ruthless to anyone, but he could do nothing to An Jing and Ouyang Lan.</p>
<p>“I can let you go to Chess Mountain on one condition.” An Tianzuo paused before continuing, ” Little Dao must go with you. During this period of time, she needs to be by your side at all times. You can’t shake her off.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” An Jing knew that this was An Tianzuo’s biggest compromise. If she didn’t agree, An Tianzuo definitely wouldn’t let her go to Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>“How long do you plan on being there?” An Tianzuo asked again.</p>
<p>“I’ll return after my Life Soul advances to a Perfect Body,” An Jing said.</p>
<p>After An Jing left, An Tianzuo called An Sheng over and told him about her going to Chess Mountain before getting him to make the arrangements.</p>
<p>“Isn’t Chess Mountain too dangerous? Although Little Saber is following Miss Jing, no one can guarantee her safety if a large-scale break-out happens at Chess Mountain,” An Sheng said worriedly.</p>
<p>“Don’t underestimate my sister. Besides, Chess Mountain shouldn’t have any major problems in a short period of time. Just do as I say.” An Tianzuo paused before saying, “Have you investigated the origins of the Companion Beasts that have recently been listed?”</p>
<p>“The various factions of the Federation are investigating. We can roughly confirm that most of the Companion Beasts come from overseas. There’s also a few that have been secretly nurtured by various local bigshots,” An Sheng replied.</p>
<p>“Indeed. From the looks of it, there will be problems with the ranking soon,” said An Tianzuo after some thought.</p>
<p>With a large number of Mythical Companion Beasts listed, Zhou Wen’s Six-Winged Guardian Dragon ranking had been demoted to seventeenth. As for the hundred ranks, it had already reached 99, leaving only one empty spot.</p>
<p>The number one spot on the ranking board was still firmly occupied by the Primordial Sword Immortal. The Death of the Underworld was still second. The other top ten rankings had suffered some drops.</p>
<p>Many of the Companion Beasts on the rankings had never been heard of by the Federation.</p>
<p>That night, the black cubes around the world lit up again.</p>
<p>As the black cubes had recently lit up more frequently, people were somewhat numb to it. Only people who passed by on the streets would pay attention to which Companion Beasts would appear on the rankings. It wasn’t like the past where many people would especially get up in the middle of the night to take a look.</p>
<p>A peacock appeared on the cubes’ screens all over the world. It was gorgeous and elegant. Soon, this Companion Beast named Thousand-Eyed Peacock was ranked in the top twenty. It happened to be in front of the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, pushing the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon back one spot.</p>
<p>The hundred spots were completely filled. The people who were watching in front of the cube believed that it was about to end. This was what had happened in the past.</p>
<p>However, the cubes didn’t turn black again. After the ranking screen disappeared, a new image appeared on the screens.</p>
<p>The scene revolved like countless stars were swirling. As the “camera” zoomed in, the screen seemed to shuttle through billions of light-years before gradually turning black.</p>
<p>Everyone was puzzled as they looked at the cube screen, unsure of what was happening.</p>
<p>When the screen lit up again, it had already turned into an emerald-green grassland. There were colorful flowers embellishing it. All the plants emitted a gentle divine glow as though they were protected by a deity.</p>
<p>On the grassland, there was a huge tree. The tree was like a divine tree, also emitting a divine glow as it produced resplendent fruits.</p>
<p>Every fruit was crystalline and seemed to have billions of stars swirling inside. Through the screen, one could sense the terrifying might emitted by the fruits.</p>
<p>As the camera zoomed in, the screen froze under the tree. There was a handsome man with white hair and a white robe sitting there. On his head was a pair of crystal-like dragon horns.</p>
<p>He sat cross-legged under the tree with his eyes closed. He was like a deity that no one could desecrate. It was as though looking straight at his face was an act of disrespect to a deity.</p>
<p>“So handsome… Who’s the man under the tree? Is he human? Or a Companion Beast?” Many women’s eyes lit up when they saw the man sitting under the tree.</p>
<p>However, the faces of those who knew that man changed drastically, especially the members of the six families. Their expressions were so ugly that they were about to freeze.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows on the top floor of a skyscraper. His gaze passed through the night sky and landed on the large square screen in the distance. An Sheng stood beside him and said with a strange expression, “Wang Mingyuan… Could it be that these cubes were his work?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure if it’s his work, but it looks like something is about to happen,” An Tianzuo said indifferently as he looked at the screen.</p>
<p>The members of the six families began to gather in front of the cubes, including the Special Inspector Bureau.</p>
<p>The originally silent night became rowdy. Countless people who were sleeping were woken up by their ringing phones. The lights that were constantly switched on illuminated the cities’ night sky.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi, Qiao Siyuan, and company were all staring at the screen. Many of the inspectors were busy with their work. This was the first time Wang Mingyuan had truly appeared since he charged into the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Although they had not seen Wang Mingyuan in person ever since that fateful night, the bureau had fought Wang Mingyuan for a long time on an intellectual level. Now, there were quite a number of high-level experts in the Federation who had secretly entered a dimensional zone after undergoing mutation. This was clearly Wang Mingyuan’s doing.</p>
<p>Although the bureau had been trying their best to prevent this from happening, the results were minimal.</p>
<p>The citizens around the world also began to focus on the cube’s screen. Although many people didn’t know Wang Mingyuan’s identity, they also felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>“Do you want to become a god? Then fight.” Wang Mingyuan sat under the tree with his eyes closed. His expression was calm and composed as he slowly extended his right hand that emitted a divine glow. A fruit dropped from the divine tree and landed in his hand.</p>
<h3 id='chapter590'>Chapter 590 Divine Frui</h3>
<p>Wang Mingyuan held the fruit in his right hand and rubbed his thumb on it a few times. Wherever he rubbed, divine light would flow from the fruit.</p>
<p>In the next second, Wang Mingyuan flipped his palm and the fruit fell onto the grass before rolling to the side.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan remained unmoved. He continued sitting under the tree with his eyes closed as though he was in meditation.</p>
<p>And at the spot where the fruit fell, a green worm crawled over the grass and slowly crawled onto the fruit before beginning to eat it.</p>
<p>The worm was very small and looked no different from a caterpillar. Its actions were very clumsy as it crawled onto the fruit with great difficulty and slowly ate it.</p>
<p>The fruit was only the size of a palm, and the worm was even smaller. It was inconspicuous lying on top, but very quickly, the green worm that had only eaten a tiny bit of the fruit started to swell up like a balloon.</p>
<p>When its body grew to the point where it could swallow the fruit, it swallowed it in one mouthful before its body swelled up crazily.</p>
<p>The caterpillar turned into a terrifying behemoth in the blink of an eye. Its body became dozens of meters long.</p>
<p>And this change didn’t stop. The worm that had turned into a giant worm emitted a terrifying divine glow. The divine glow burned like flames which enveloped the giant worm’s body and constantly emitted light.</p>
<p>When the glow reached its limit, the light that it emitted almost made one unable to open their eyes. When the light gradually converged, everyone was surprised to discover that the giant worm had already transformed into a beautiful butterfly.</p>
<p>What was even more shocking was that in the middle of the butterfly wings, there was something akin to a human female’s body. It was wearing green, glass-like armor and had a pair of antennae on its head. Its entire body emitted an unparalleled brilliance, like a descending goddess of light that had butterfly wings.</p>
<p>All the humans were dumbfounded. They watched, stunned, as the worm turned into such a terrifying creature. The gaze they used to look at the fruits on the tree turned fervent.</p>
<p>Many people were considering how such a weak worm could become so terrifying and powerful after consuming the fruit. What if they were the ones eating the fruit?</p>
<p>The worm that had turned into the butterfly girl stared greedily at the divine tree’s fruits. Her butterfly wings flapped and the patterns on the wings began to spread out.</p>
<p>It was brighter closer to the center. When the circular pattern lit up, it was like two suns embedded on her butterfly wings.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Two terrifying beams shot out from the center of the butterfly wings, piercing through the void and striking at the divine tree. Such terrifying might made it feel as if it could even penetrate mountains, much less a tree.</p>
<p>However, the two terrifying beams failed to touch the divine tree. Wang Mingyuan, who was sitting cross-legged under the tree with his eyes closed, didn’t move. His body emitted a mysterious glow that shielded the tree from the butterfly girl’s two beams.</p>
<p>The terrifying power of the beam couldn’t even penetrate the glow emitted by Wang Mingyuan. The butterfly girl’s wings shimmered as she gritted her teeth and continued shooting beams, but it was all in vain.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan extended his palm as though he was casually extending his finger. However, the light on the butterfly girl’s wings instantly vanished as her body involuntarily flew towards Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>The closer she got to Wang Mingyuan, the smaller her body became. In a blink of an eye, she landed in his palm like an ordinary butterfly. No matter how she flapped her wings and struggled, she was unable to fly out of his palm.</p>
<p>A strange light rose from Wang Mingyuan’s palm. The light flowed faster and faster, like streams of light circling the butterfly girl. Finally, it completely enveloped the butterfly girl’s body in the spinning light. By the time the light dissipated, Wang Mingyuan’s palm was empty.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The scene on the cube changed. The images of Wang Mingyuan and the divine tree vanished, turning back into the cube itself. The butterfly girl stood on the cube, and beside her appeared her name: “Radiant Butterfly Queen.”</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because the ranking had already been filled with 100 names, the name of the Radiant Butterfly Queen did not appear on the rankings.</p>
<p>However, everyone soon discovered that the name of the Dark Lord, who was ranked ninth, lit up. Not long after, the Dark Lord’s figure appeared on the cube, confronting the Radiant Butterfly Queen.</p>
<p>When the Radiant Butterfly Queen saw the Dark Lord, the light on her wings lit up again without any hesitation. Circles of light lit up before condensing at the center of the circle. Two beams shot out like lasers, so fast that no one could dodge.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord was a black-armored skeleton with black flames burning over its body. The sword representing darkness broke out of its sheath, and the sky behind it turned dark due to the unsheathed Sword of Darkness. As the Sword of Darkness slashed at the Radiant Butterfly Queen, the darkness devoured the light ahead.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Two beams of light shot into the darkness. The Sword of Darkness collided with the power of light. Amidst the clash, the Dark Lord let out a tragic cry. His body and the Sword of Darkness were quickly purified by the power of light, disappearing completely a moment later.</p>
<p>The battle scene disappeared. On the cube screens all over the world, a ranking appeared. The name of the Dark Lord, who was previously ranked ninth, vanished. The name of the Radiant Butterfly Queen appeared at the ninth place, replacing him.</p>
<p>The people watching the battle were alarmed. Previously, when they saw Wang Mingyuan suppress the Radiant Butterfly Queen with a flip of his hand, they thought nothing of her.</p>
<p>However, to their surprise, she could easily defeat the Dark Lord, who was ranked ninth. Although one could tell that she had an attribute advantage over the Dark Lord, it still meant that Radiant Butterfly Queen was ranked in the top ten.</p>
<p>The scene on the cube changed and Wang Mingyuan appeared on the screen again. He continued sitting cross-legged under the divine tree with his eyes closed.</p>
<p>When they saw him again, many people’s expressions changed. The divine tree and fruits behind him became the focus of human attention.</p>
<p>It was just a worm. After eating one fruit, it had become a powerful existence like the Radiant Butterfly Queen, and there were many fruits on the tree.</p>
<p>“The day of ripening of the next fruit will be three months from now. When that happens, the owner of the Companion Beast that ranks first will have the right to pluck a fruit.”</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan’s voice traveled through the cube to every corner of the world. It also generated many complicated thoughts and ideas in the minds of all humans.</p>
<p>After this sentence, the cube’s screen dimmed, turning pitch black.</p>
<p>However, their enthusiasm wasn’t extinguished because of the screen shutdown. It became even more fervent. The media constantly released the video they had recorded. In the middle of the night, many people were discussing the matter of the divine tree and fruits, as well as who had the right to pluck the ripened divine fruit in three months’ time.</p>
<h3 id='chapter591'>Chapter 591 Divine Fruit Suspicions</h3>
<p>An Tianzuo sat back on the sofa and An Sheng poured him a cup of tea before asking, “What do you think of this matter, Overseer?”</p>
<p>“What are your thoughts on the matter?” An Tianzuo placed his finger on the teacup and rubbed it, but he had no intention of raising it.</p>
<p>“Wang Mingyuan is very powerful. He displayed the magical effects of the fruit and proved the power of the Radiant Butterfly Queen. He didn’t say much, but every word he said was filled with irresistible temptation. However, if you think about it carefully, you will realize that he didn’t say a word about the key question,” An Sheng answered.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo raised his teacup and took a sip. After enjoying the aftertaste, he put down the teacup and said, “Tell me. What’s the key?”</p>
<p>“Firstly, we don’t know where the fruit tree is. We can’t be sure if someone can really pluck the fruit. Secondly, the true use of the fruit is unknown. Although he has already shown the fruit’s abilities, we still don’t know if the Radiant Butterfly Queen is a dimensional creature, a Companion Beast, or an ordinary worm. It’s even possible that it was a creature with the strength of a Mythical creature to begin with. The fruit only stimulated it and allowed it to showcase its true strength.”</p>
<p>After a pause, An Sheng continued, “Let’s take a step back. Even if the fruit is really useful, will it be useful for humans? If it’s only useful for Companion Beasts, its value will be greatly reduced. As we can see, there are already a hundred Mythical Companion Beasts on the rankings. With these Mythical Companion Beasts as the foundation, humanity has the ability to kill Mythical creatures. In the future, we will only obtain more and more Mythical Companion Beasts. It doesn’t seem like there’s a need to take the risk to vie for first place.”</p>
<p>“Since it’s something we can figure out, Wang Mingyuan naturally has figured out the same. Yet, he deliberately didn’t say anything. What does this mean?” An Tianzuo pondered.</p>
<p>“It’s not easy to guess. If Wang Mingyuan wants to trigger a battle royale, he shouldn’t have left so much suspicion. It makes people think about it too much. Under such circumstances, I’m afraid not many people will try their best to obtain first place,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Could there be such a possibility? Wang Mingyuan doesn’t want the competition to become too intense?” An Tianzuo said after some thought.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t seem to make sense. What benefits does it bring to him?” An Sheng asked.</p>
<p>The various families were studying Wang Mingyuan’s actions. Most of them had the same thoughts as An Tianzuo and An Sheng.</p>
<p>They were wary of Wang Mingyuan’s goal of delivering the fruit. With such a magical fruit, Wang Mingyuan could have swallowed it himself. Why did he offer it?</p>
<p>There were all sorts of speculations, and ordinary citizens had different opinions. However, most of them were biased towards conspiracy theories, suspecting that this was Wang Mingyuan’s scheme.</p>
<p>Some said that Wang Mingyuan wanted to trigger a war between humans and weaken humanity’s strength. Others said that Wang Mingyuan wanted to use the fruit to lure human experts into a dimensional zone.</p>
<p>In any case, there were all sorts of things to be said. The ranking remained the same. No one challenged it.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen learned of this matter, it was already the third day since the event. This was because he had spent most of his time at Small Buddha Temple. He didn’t watch the news, so he naturally didn’t know that so many things had happened.</p>
<p>Only when Li Xuan sent a message to Zhou Wen did Zhou Wen realize that something like this had happened. He watched the video on the Internet.</p>
<p>What’s Teacher trying to do? Zhou Wen was also guessing Wang Mingyuan’s intentions. He didn’t have a deep understanding of Wang Mingyuan, but if Wang Mingyuan’s original intentions hadn’t changed, he probably wouldn’t weaken humanity’s combat strength.</p>
<p>However, people were prone to change. No one knew if Wang Mingyuan could still abide by his original intent. It was unknown if it changed with his identity.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, you are Wang Mingyuan’s student. Based on your understanding of him, do you think those fruits can really help humans advance to the Mythical stage?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“I really don’t know about that. From beginning to end, Teacher never said that those fruits can allow humans to advance to the Mythical stage. I don’t think you should have too much hope,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“How can I have any hope? Even if I believe that the fruit is real and Wang Mingyuan isn’t lying, I don’t have any Mythical creatures that can vie for first place! Mythical pets aren’t something you can find on the street. Our Li family doesn’t even have a Mythical Companion Beast,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“There will be. There are a hundred Mythical Companion Beasts on the ranking now. With humanity having more Mythical Companion Beasts, their commonness will only accelerate,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Let’s not talk about that. Your Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s ranking has dropped so much. Do you still have the chance to vie for first place?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“Probably not.” Zhou Wen knew very well that Six-Winged was mainly a guardian. Compared to the powerful offensive pets, its combat strength was still lacking.</p>
<p>Ignoring everything else, the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon probably couldn’t defend against the terrifying beam of light from the Radiant Butterfly Queen.</p>
<p>“That’s a pity. I heard from some analysis that only Companion Beasts can participate in the ranking battle. Otherwise, you might be able to give it a try.” Li Xuan felt pity for Zhou Wen. He felt that if the owner of the Companion Beast could participate in the battle, Zhou Wen’s ranking might be higher.</p>
<p>The two of them chatted for a while before Li Xuan went to cultivate. His improvement had been extremely fast recently. In the constant battles with dimensional creatures, the carapace formed by his Life Soul was constantly shattered before being reborn and becoming stronger. Now, he had advanced to an Evolved Body.</p>
<p>However, after advancing to an Evolved Body, it was impossible for the Life Soul to continue evolving by just being injured in battle. Li Xuan was also searching for a way to advance.</p>
<p>I wonder if Torch Dragon will be able to obtain first on the rankings. Zhou Wen coveted the divine tree’s fruits.</p>
<p>He didn’t expect the divine tree’s fruit to advance him to the Mythical stage. As long as the fruit could allow a Companion Beast to advance to the Mythical stage, it was already very attractive to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>He had a few Companion Beasts on him. Although they weren’t at the Mythical stage, their combat strength and abilities were excellent. For example, Doctor Darkness, Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, etc.</p>
<p>If they could advance to the Mythical stage, they would play a very powerful role.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen didn’t dare let a Companion Beast like the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General advance again.</p>
<p>Even if they couldn’t be used, it would be good to get the Banana Fairy to advance to the Mythical stage as soon as possible. Now, Banana Fairy’s Grand Yin Wind couldn’t keep up with his needs.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth has been evolving for a long time. Why hasn’t it completed its evolution? Zhou Wen glanced at the chaos space and couldn’t help but frown when he saw that Tyrant Behemoth still hadn’t evolved.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the mysterious phone vibrated. Zhou Wen took out his phone and saw the Dead Man Tree appear on the screen. The fruit that Ják had formed after absorbing it had finally ripened.</p>
<h3 id='chapter592'>Chapter 592 Explosive Fiend Man</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted as he plucked the grenade-like Companion Egg from the Dead Man Tree and quickly checked its stats.</p>
<p>Explosive Fiend Man: Mortal (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Strength: 11</p>
<p>Speed: 11</p>
<p>Constitution: 11</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 11</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Death List, Time-Blast</p>
<p>Companion Form: Self-detonation Device</p>
<p>Mortal stage! Zhou Wen immediately felt a headache. The time and resources needed to nurture a Companion Beast were astonishing. It was mainly because it was useless for the time being.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully read the Explosive Fiend Man’s skill introductions. The more he read, the more pleasantly surprised he became.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t know what Life Providence and Life Soul Explosive Fiend Man would have in the future, just these two skills alone were terrifying.</p>
<p>Time-Blast was similar to a Life Blast, but it was more flexible. It could turn some life-forms into time bombs, but it needed to be prepared in advance. The stronger the lifeform’s energy was, the more powerful the blast.</p>
<p>This skill was secondary. After all, using Time-Blast required the target to be still. If he used it on living creatures, he had to take down the target first. It was more troublesome.</p>
<p>The truly terrifying skill was Death List. This skill had clearly fused with the Mythical Black Cat’s curse skill. As long as the target signed their name on the Death List, he could control the time of their death, turning the target into a time bomb.</p>
<p>Of course, Death List wasn’t a corporeal existence. It could be cast on any piece of paper, jade, piece of wood, or even walls or floor. As long as the person signed the name, it would be effective.</p>
<p>This Companion Beast was an excellent Companion Beast for assassination.</p>
<p>As for the companion form of the Explosive Fiend Man, it was also terrifying. As the name implied, the self-detonation device allowed it to explode. This skill could only be used once. It would explode with all its force and perish together with the enemy.</p>
<p>To others, this companion form was basically impossible to use. Under normal circumstances, he wouldn’t be willing to let the Explosive Fiend Man self-destruct.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was different. He wouldn’t let the Explosive Fiend Man self-destruct in real life, but he could do it in-game. Thinking of how he could advance Explosive Fiend Man to the Mythical stage before self-destructing it, the energy released would definitely be terrifying.</p>
<p>This was an extreme Companion Beast. If used well, it could kill anything. If used poorly, it might be useless trash.</p>
<p>I wonder what the Life Providence and Life Soul of the Explosive Fiend Man are? Without any second thoughts, Zhou Wen hatched it. He thought highly of this Companion Beast and planned on nurturing it with all his might.</p>
<p>After the Explosive Fiend Man hatched, a black-armored Companion Beast that looked like a Tesla Trooper appeared in front of Zhou Wen. His height and build were about the same as Ják’s, but due to its armor, he couldn’t tell what he looked like.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried the Explosive Fiend Man’s skills in-game. Typical dimensional creatures couldn’t sign their names, making the Death List skill practically useless.</p>
<p>Time-Blast could only be used on some plant-type or immobile animals. The power needed depended on the energy contained in the creature itself. It needed to be used in a specific environment, and it wasn’t suitable to be used in combat.</p>
<p>However, the self-explosion device was what surprised Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>When he transformed into the self-detonation device, it was like a lock. It locked onto the target he could touch, preventing it from escaping.</p>
<p>The might of self-detonation was also very powerful. A Mortal-stage Explosive Fiend Man could severely injure Legendary dimensional creatures when self-destructing.</p>
<p>I have to think of a way to raise the Explosive Fiend Man to the Mythical stage. I’ll have to rely on him to kill bosses in the future. I’ll lock onto a boss and self-destruct. Perhaps I can directly blast a Mythical boss to death, Zhou Wen thought, although he felt a little worried.</p>
<p>It was relatively easy to advance to the Legendary stage and the Epic stage, but advancing to the Mythical stage was extremely difficult.</p>
<p>I’ll take my time to rear him. Zhou Wen attempted to feed the Explosive Fiend Man his Companion Beasts. Thankfully, the Explosive Fiend Man wasn’t picky with food. Be it Companion Beasts or Companion Eggs, he ate without scruples.</p>
<p>I wonder if I can feed the Explosive Fiend Man with the fruit from the Longevity Tree… Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>After Demonic Neonate plucked many Longevity Fruits, she would ask Zhou Wen for one every day. Zhou Wen only dared to use them to feed Demonic Neonate. He didn’t dare feed them to his other pets. Who knew if the Longevity Fruit would have side effects?</p>
<p>Despite Demonic Neonate being fine eating the Longevity Fruit, she was quite odd, so it didn’t mean that the other pets would be fine after eating it. Therefore, Zhou Wen didn’t dare to randomly feed the Longevity Fruit to anything else.</p>
<p>This Explosive Fiend Beast was similarly terrifying. Zhou Wen felt that he could try feeding the Longevity Fruit to him. If he was willing to eat the Longevity Fruit, his evolution speed would be much faster.</p>
<p>However, this seemed risky. Zhou Wen was somewhat hesitant.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen thought of something. The Longevity Fruit could allow a human to quickly evolve and also allow a Companion Beast to rapidly evolve. This function was similar to the divine fruit.</p>
<p>Although the two trees looked different, their functions were very similar. However, the effects of the Longevity Fruit were not as strong as the divine tree’s fruit.</p>
<p>Back then, Lord Alcohol was already at the Epic stage. He ate a Longevity Fruit, but he didn’t truly enter the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and didn’t take the risk with Explosive Fiend Man. There was only one such Companion Beast, and it was impossible for another one to drop. He would rather feed it slowly than cause any problems.</p>
<p>When he arrived at Small Buddha Temple again, Zhou Wen continued cultivating Zero Taboo. After this period of training, the Zero Taboo crystal had already turned fully crystalline and resplendent like a diamond.</p>
<p>The taboo power of Small Buddha Temple was no longer able to hone the crystal as before.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen walked into the temple, the Zero Taboo crystal suddenly emitted a terrifying glow.</p>
<p>The crystal was like a Rubik’s Cube as it began spinning automatically. The crystal structure was spinning and reforming, making it look extremely mysterious.</p>
<p>Is it evolving? Zhou Wen was delighted. After training it for so long, he had finally waited for Zero Taboo to evolve.</p>
<p>As the crystal spun, a strange light emitted from it. The light was misty like clouds and fog, but it also resembled a nebula.</p>
<p>As the light blob inside changed, the crystal’s body constantly shrank. Before long, the light blob expanded over the crystal’s body and enveloped the crystal within the nebula-like light blob.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also felt a mysterious power flowing out from the nebula, making his body feel more relaxed. He almost couldn’t sense the taboo power of Small Buddha Temple.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Suddenly, the nebula blob shrank and when it reached its limit, it exploded.</p>
<p>The huge explosion in his sea of consciousness didn’t really exist, but it left Zhou Wen momentarily dazed. When he snapped to his senses and looked into his sea of consciousness again, his mouth gaped open in surprise.</p>
<h3 id='chapter593'>Chapter 593 Gods Retrea</h3>
<p>Zero Taboo was originally a crystal, but it had transformed into the shape of an infant. It sat cross-legged in Zhou Wen’s mind space like a crystalline jade statue.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the infant’s appearance was very similar to Zhou Wen’s. Zhou Wen vaguely remembered that there was a picture of him when he was young back at his old place. It looked very similar to the baby in the mind space.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was in Small Buddha Temple, but he didn’t sense the taboo power of Small Buddha Temple. The infant jade statue didn’t emit any light either. Its eyes were closed as though it had fallen asleep.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen opened his eyes and checked the blood-colored avatar’s information on the phone. He saw that the name and annotation had changed in the Life Soul column.</p>
<p>Gods Retreat (Evolved Body): Where the Life Soul is, the Gods flee.</p>
<p>This introduction is more impressive than before, but I wonder what its true effects are? Zhou Wen felt that the annotation was a little too crazy.</p>
<p>It was clearly meaning that wherever the Life Soul went, even gods had to avoid it. How could an Evolved Body Life Soul be capable of this?</p>
<p>Regardless, he could indeed sense the growth of his Life Soul. This was because the taboo of Small Buddha Temple was completely ineffective against the jade infant named “Gods Retreat.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that staying here was probably useless. He had to search for a forbidden ground that was even stronger than Small Buddha Temple. He wanted to see if he could use Gods Retreat to continue raising his strength.</p>
<p>I wonder what the Perfect Body will be after Zero Taboo and Gods Retreat? Zhou Wen was more curious about the Life Soul condensed by the Dao Body.</p>
<p>Unlike other Life Souls, every evolution of the Dao Body Life Soul seemed to involve a huge change.</p>
<p>Where else has taboo powers that are stronger than Small Buddha Temple? Immortal Seeking Mountain? It’s too far. Besides, I don’t know the way to Immortal Seeking Mountain… Zhou Wen left Small Buddha Temple and thought about where he could continue cultivating the entire way.</p>
<p>After some thought, he felt that the best place to go was probably White Cloud Mountain’s Jade Emperor Peak. There was an extremely powerful taboo power there that might allow Gods Retreat to improve.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already downloaded the White Cloud Mountain dungeon on his phone, but its name was Demon Suppression Mountain.</p>
<p>After launching the Demon Suppression Mountain dungeon, the blood-colored avatar appeared outside the Jade Emperor Peak’s entrance. Zhou Wen still remembered that the last time he stepped into the mountain, Zero Taboo nearly exploded in less than ten seconds.</p>
<p>I wonder how long I can now last? Zhou Wen activated the Gods Retreat Life Soul and controlled the blood-colored avatar to enter the Jade Emperor Peak’s entrance.</p>
<p>The moment he passed the entrance, the Gods Retreat Life Soul opened his eyes. The crystalline body emitted a strange glow.</p>
<p>Then, Zhou Wen saw a strange force surge towards the baby jade statue. It was not like when he had Zero Taboo. The Life Soul sucked the mysterious taboo power into his body and made it part of him.</p>
<p>The taboo power of Jade Emperor Peak failed to injure the jade infant statue. Instead, it made the glow over him grow stronger as though it was protected by divine light.</p>
<p>What a powerful Life Soul. If that’s the case, wouldn’t I be able to come and go freely on Jade Emperor Peak? I wouldn’t have to worry about the length of time? Zhou Wen made the blood-colored avatar walk up the stone steps, hoping to figure out what secrets White Cloud Mountain’s Jade Emperor Peak held.</p>
<p>After walking up the stone steps, it didn’t take him long to see a huge hall. On both sides of the hall was a stone beast statue. It looked rather strange.</p>
<p>The two stone statues were crouching. They looked like stone tigers, but there were curved horns on their heads. Fiery cloud patterns were engraved on their bodies.</p>
<p>What was even more strange was that there was a word engraved on the foreheads of the two stone tigers. On the left side of the door was the word Suppression. On the right side of the stone tiger was the word “Demon.”</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen approached the temple, he saw the words Demon Suppression on the two stone tigers’ foreheads light up.</p>
<p>As the words ‘Demon Suppression’ lit up, Zhou Wen realized that the strange powers had gushed into Gods Retreat’s body like a heavenly river. The jade infant’s face revealed a look of pain, and its body also began to show signs of abnormality, as though there were faint cracks appearing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly controlled the blood-colored avatar to leave Jade Emperor Peak. Although Gods Retreat didn’t have the ability to make all gods retreat, his abilities were indeed much stronger than Zero Taboo. Furthermore, he could absorb the taboo power.</p>
<p>However, the power of the words Demon Suppression was too powerful, preventing the jade infant from digesting it.</p>
<p>Although I can’t enter the temple, I’ve found a way to evolve the jade infant. I’ll just cultivate on Jade Emperor Peak in the future. It’s only a matter of time before I advance to a Perfect Body. Zhou Wen was considering if he should personally make a trip to White Cloud Mountain. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to grind other dungeons if he stayed on White Cloud Mountain in-game.</p>
<p>I should make a trip to White Cloud Mountain. I might even have a chance to see the immortal palace phenomenon. Zhou Wen thought for a long time before deciding to make a trip to White Cloud Mountain in reality.</p>
<p>He told An Sheng, Li Xuan, and his friends about his trip to White Cloud Mountain. An Sheng told Zhou Wen to be careful. Other than that, there was nothing else.</p>
<p>After Li Xuan heard about White Cloud Mountain, he indicated an interest in going with Zhou Wen. He had recently reached a bottleneck and hadn’t been able to continue his breakthrough. He was thinking of heading out for a spin to change his train of thought.</p>
<p>That afternoon, the two of them went to White Cloud Mountain. As it was in Luoyang, the duo rode their Companion Beasts and soon arrived at White Cloud Mountain.</p>
<p>“Put this on. You can’t take it off no matter what. Otherwise, don’t blame me when you see the immortal palace phenomenon.” Zhou Wen threw a balaclava at Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you wearing one?” Li Xuan asked suspiciously when he saw Zhou Wen prepare a balaclava.</p>
<p>“Let alone the immortal palace phenomenon, even if gods really descend, I wouldn’t need to close my eyes and hide,” Zhou Wen said half-jokingly.</p>
<p>“You’re awesome, aren’t you!” Li Xuan gloomily put on the balaclava. Zhou Wen led the way as the two of them climbed up White Cloud Mountain.</p>
<p>With the Gods Retreat Life Soul, Zhou Wen was still looking forward to seeing the immortal palace phenomenon again. Previously, due to his lacking strength, he hadn’t been able to clearly see what the fairy, who tore out of the entrance, looked like. If she were to come out again, he could see her clearly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no immortal palace phenomenon appeared along the way. Even when the two of them arrived at the entrance of Jade Emperor Peak, they did not see a single dimensional creature, much less any phenomena.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, why aren’t you walking?” Li Xuan asked Zhou Wen since he couldn’t see a thing.</p>
<p>“Jade Emperor Peak is in front. After passing through the entrance, there’s a terrifying taboo power inside. Even Mythical creatures will die in a short period of time if they enter. I cultivate an Essence Energy Art that can withstand that forbidden power. Furthermore, I need to cultivate inside. Don’t come in,” Zhou Wen said to Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“You’ve mentioned it before. I came here for Jade Emperor Peak’s taboo powers. You can enter by yourself. Don’t mind me,” Li Xuan said as he summoned his Life Soul. The black carapace wrapped around his body as a black evil aura rose from the armor. It looked evil and powerful, completely different from Li Xuan’s usual demeanor.</p>
<p>594 Suicidal Farming</p>
<p>“Don’t do anything rash. The taboo power here is very powerful. It will really kill you,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I’m just afraid that it’s not strong enough,” Li Xuan said as he stepped onto the stone steps on Jade Emperor Peak.</p>
<p>Just as he walked in, the carapace on his body crackled. Large amounts of cracks appeared on it, and blood oozed out.</p>
<p>In the next second, Li Xuan leaped out. By the time he landed, most of his carapace had shattered. Only a few remaining pieces were hanging from his body. His body was covered in blood and wounds everywhere, as though he had just been scooped out of a pool of blood.</p>
<p>“Are you alright?” Zhou Wen hurriedly went over to check Li Xuan’s injuries. It was a ghastly sight. There were bone-deep wounds everywhere.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. It’s really strong. This is it. This will be the best training ground for me.” Li Xuan struggled to his feet. The injuries on his body were healing at a discernible pace. Even the shattered carapace was rapidly growing amidst black-gray flames.</p>
<p>In moments, Li Xuan’s injuries and armor had completely recovered, as though he had never been injured.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about me. Just do what you need to do,” Li Xuan said as he charged into Jade Emperor Peak. In the next second, Zhou Wen saw him thrown out again, covered in blood.</p>
<p>Seeing that he was fine, Zhou Wen walked into the Jade Emperor Peak himself. With the Gods Retreat absorbing the taboo power and protecting his body, he naturally wouldn’t be as miserable as Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Not daring to touch the two Demon Suppression beasts, Zhou Wen sat on the stone steps and gamed. He allowed the jade infant to absorb the taboo powers on the Jade Emperor Peak to slowly become stronger.</p>
<p>“Ah… Bam… Ah… Bam…” On Jade Emperor Peak, screams and sounds of falling could be heard from time to time. Even Zhou Wen was surprised by Li Xuan’s perseverance.</p>
<p>Although his recovery abilities were extremely strong and injuries weren’t a big deal to him, such injuries would definitely put Li Xuan in extreme pain. To endure such pain time and time again and even seek out injuries required immense perseverance. This form of self-torture to grow stronger wasn’t something anyone could withstand.</p>
<p>However, the effects of Li Xuan’s actions were obvious. Every time his body and carapace were repaired, he would last a little longer on Jade Emperor Peak. It was obvious that he was becoming stronger.</p>
<p>Seeing that Li Xuan was fine, Zhou Wen began grinding.</p>
<p>This time, he went straight to the Qiongqi temple. He had an idea. Perhaps he could kill Qiongqi without using the Bright Torch Vision World, but he didn’t know if it would work.</p>
<p>After arriving outside the Qiongqi temple, Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to enter. Instead, he summoned Torch Dragon, Golden Battle God Halberd, and Six-Winged Guardian Dragon.</p>
<p>Following that, he summoned Explosive Fiend Man and cast Time-Blast on Torch Dragon, Golden Battle God Halberd, and Six-Winged Guardian Dragon.</p>
<p>Explosive Fiend Man walked in front of Six-Winged Guardian Dragon and extended his palm to press on its stomach.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched from the side as the armor on Explosive Fiend Man’s body lit up. It was as though a red stream of light was flowing through a connected tube, eventually flowing into Explosive Fiend Man’s palm.</p>
<p>A red light pattern immediately appeared on the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s belly. It had lines like a circuit board that spread across its body.</p>
<p>The light patterns spread very slowly. Two hours later, the red light patterns on the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon occupied one of the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s legs.</p>
<p>Explosive Fiend Man is only at the Mortal stage. His Essence Energy is too limited, so he can’t quickly release a Time-Blast. I can only take things slowly. In a real battle, it would be impossible to use the Explosive Fiend Man to fight. Zhou Wen didn’t have a good solution either. All he could do was patiently wait.</p>
<p>After four days, Zhou Wen really couldn’t wait any longer. Thankfully, most of the spots on the Golden Battle God Halberd and Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s bodies were filled with Time-Blast’s red patterns. Zhou Wen didn’t plan on waiting any longer. He planned on giving it a try with this lineup.</p>
<p>Pushing open the temple door, Zhou Wen ordered Six-Winged and Golden Battle God Halberd to charge in. At the same time, he summoned Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to restrain Qiongqi.</p>
<p>When Qiongqi saw Six-Winged and Golden Battle God Halberd rush in, it immediately charged forward ferociously. Just as its claws were about to touch Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, Six-Winged and Golden Battle God Halberd emitted a red glow.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The entire Qiongqi temple shook as dust fell everywhere. Zhou Wen and company had hidden to the side. After the explosion ended, he hurriedly looked into the temple.</p>
<p>The temple was in a mess. Corpse fragments were everywhere. There wasn’t even an intact bone left of Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. The Golden Battle God Halberd had also been reduced to pieces.</p>
<p>However, it could be seen that their bodies weren’t fully exploded and the energy usage was very low. This might be related to the low level of Explosive Fiend Man.</p>
<p>As for Qiongqi, its head and chest were badly mangled. Its legs had snapped. Although it wasn’t dead, it had been severely injured.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly got Torch Dragon to charge in and fight the seriously injured Qiongqi.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon originally could not kill Qiongqi without using the Bright Torch Vision World, but now that Qiongqi was heavily injured and restrained by the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, Torch Dragon immediately gained the upper hand.</p>
<p>After a bitter battle lasting more than an hour, Torch Dragon finally killed Qiongqi in the temple. It was mainly because Qiongqi’s speed was too fast. Even with Qiongqi having its leg injured, Torch Dragon still spent a lot of effort to force Qiongqi into a dead-end before finally killing it.</p>
<p>Ding! As Qiongqi fell, a crisp sound entered Zhou Wen’s ears as a dimensional crystal dropped.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but feel somewhat disappointed. Most dimensional crystals were useless to him now. Even if it was a Mythical Essence Energy Skill Crystal, he couldn’t absorb it due to his lacking stats. He couldn’t bring it out of the game and could only let it disappear during his respawning.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen took a closer look at the crystal, he was somewhat surprised. Beneath the gray crystal was the word “Evil stat 34.”</p>
<p>Evil stat? This was the first time Zhou Wen had heard of such an attribute. He had never seen it before.</p>
<p>However, since it was a rare stat, it would definitely be useful in the future. It should be useful when learning Essence Energy Skills.</p>
<p>After picking up the Evil stat crystal and absorbing it, there was indeed an additional Evil stat among his rare stats. Furthermore, it was as high as 34 points.</p>
<p>Although this method can kill Qiongqi, Explosive Fiend Man’s level is too low. It’s really irritating using him. I have to raise his level. Zhou Wen had the urge to feed the Explosive Fiend Man the Longevity Fruit.</p>
<p>However, on second thought, he did not. After all, Explosive Fiend Man wasn’t picky with food. It could evolve by eating anything, but Demonic Neonate didn’t eat anything other than the Longevity Fruits. There were only so many Longevity Fruits, so there would be nothing left after they were finished. Zhou Wen still planned on reserving the Longevity Fruits for Demonic Neonate to eat.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were cultivating on White Cloud Mountain, something huge happened. Finally, someone issued a Companion Beast ranking challenge. </p>
<h3 id='chapter595'>Chapter 595 Primordial Sword Immortal</h3>
<p>The Companion Beast that was challenged wasn’t the number one Primordial Sword Immortal, but Frost Giant that had been pushed down to sixteen.</p>
<p>A Companion Beast named Deep Frost Behemoth appeared on the screen of the cubes. It looked like a giant octopus. It was ice-blue in color, and its position was on a platform above a huge cube. The cube’s surroundings were empty, making it look nothing like a city.</p>
<p>On the right side of the screen, a ranking appeared. Rank 16’s Frost Giant’s name kept flashing as an alarm rung.</p>
<p>Behind the Frost Giant’s name was a 72-hour countdown. People guessed that this was the time given to the owner of Frost Giant to consider accepting the challenge. If the countdown ended and the owner hadn’t accepted the challenge, it would probably be determined as a loss.</p>
<p>Everyone was discussing if Frost Giant would accept the challenge, but this question quickly had an answer. The alarm stopped and Frost Giant’s name was completely lit up. Then, the ranking vanished. Frost Giant also appeared on the cube where the Deep Frost Behemoth was. They stared at each other.</p>
<p>Frost Giant was covered in ice-blue skin. Its head, shoulder, waist, and other parts were covered in frost metal armor. It also had an iron ax in its hand.</p>
<p>Although Frost Giant was huge, it appeared a little shorter in front of the Deep Frost Behemoth.</p>
<p>With a roar, Frost Giant’s ax slashed at the Deep Frost Behemoth. After all, they were all Companion Beasts, so there wasn’t any need for unnecessary communication.</p>
<p>Frost powers tore out of the ax, forming a huge ice streak that spread to the Deep Frost Behemoth.</p>
<p>The tentacles of the Deep Frost Behemoth danced, producing frost as they shattered the ice streaks.</p>
<p>The two gigantic monsters clashed intensely on the cube’s platform. As they were both frost-type Companion Beasts and strength-based, the intense battle between the two terrifying Mythical Companion Beasts sent frost shards flying everywhere, like fireworks formed from frost.</p>
<p>The two Companion Beasts were evenly matched as they used various frost-elemental skills. However, both parties had high resistance against the cold. Their bodies were extremely tough, so they were only slightly injured. Neither of them could do a thing to the other.</p>
<p>The Deep Frost Behemoth finally couldn’t help but take the initiative to launch an attack. The huge tentacles on its body were raised as dark-blue suction cups lit up. Rays of freezing light shot out from them towards Frost Giant.</p>
<p>Frost Giant didn’t give in either. He raised his ax over his head and cleaved down. The ice-like power roared out like an ice river and collided with the Deep Frost Behemoth’s ice beams.</p>
<p>Cracking sounds constantly rang out as the entire platform began to freeze due to the two extremely terrifying cold forces. In just a moment, Frost Giant and Deep Frost Behemoth were wrapped in ice. The entire platform seemed to be covered by glaciers as everything became silent.</p>
<p>“Who won?” The spectators were puzzled.</p>
<p>Now, the two Mythical creatures were frozen in ice, making it difficult to determine the victor.</p>
<p>Suddenly, cracks appeared on the ice. A moment later, the huge ice block shattered and Frost Giant broke out. He held the ax in his hand and roared as he slashed at the Deep Frost Behemoth.</p>
<p>Just as everyone reeled in excitement and thought that they were about to see the scene of a Mythical Companion Beast being killed, the Deep Frost Behemoth’s body suddenly transformed into a stream of light and vanished. It seemed to have teleported away from the cube platform.</p>
<p>The first Companion Beast challenge ended in failure. Deep Frost Behemoth failed to win over the ranking, but this battle made many people discover something.</p>
<p>It turned out that the challenge didn’t have to be fought to the end. One could even admit defeat and withdraw. This gave a variety of ideas to people.</p>
<p>Many Companion Beasts might not have the qualifications to clinch first place, but they could challenge their opposing faction’s Mythical Companion Beasts to figure out their strength and come up with a counter in the future.</p>
<p>This was especially so for the opposing factions in the Federation and overseas factions. There was very little information about overseas, so the Federation’s knowledge of their Companion Beasts was limited. Perhaps they could take this opportunity to understand the abilities of the Companion Beasts overseas.</p>
<p>Challenges on various Companion Beasts increased after the first battle. The battles of top-notch Companion Beasts were like a visual feast for ordinary people. It allowed many people who might never come into contact with Mythical Companion Beasts in their lifetime to witness their strength and horror.</p>
<p>The challenge wasn’t limited to Companion Beasts that weren’t ranked. The Companion Beasts on the ranking board could also challenge each other, but they could only challenge those ranked higher than them.</p>
<p>To initiate a challenge, one only needed to find a cube and inject Essence Energy from the top. This was how they got onto the rankings. The Companion Beast would then be teleported to a black cube in the void.</p>
<p>The black cube was extremely large. Fighting on it didn’t affect anyone or any city. After the battle ended, Companion Beasts would be teleported back to their respective cubes.</p>
<p>During the battle, the owner could also choose to withdraw their Companion Beast. Withdrawing was equivalent to admitting defeat.</p>
<p>The cube’s initial ranking was determined by the Companion Beasts’ stats, skills, Life Providence, Life Soul, and Wheel of Destiny, but it wasn’t completely accurate, nor did it represent actual combat abilities.</p>
<p>Ever since the beginning of the challenge, there had been quite a number of Companion Beasts, which were ranked at the bottom, defeating those ranked at the top.</p>
<p>The overall combat strength ranking did not mean actual combat strength.</p>
<p>However, the first few challenges were basically from low-ranking Companion Beasts. The top ten Companion Beasts were never challenged.</p>
<p>However, it only took a few days before this changed. A Companion Beast that had never been on the rankings and had never been heard of actually challenged first place—Primordial Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>This battle attracted the attention of the entire Federation and people from overseas. To be ranked first, even if it was only determined by the cubes, the strength of Primordial Sword Immortal was not to be underestimated.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, someone finally can’t hold back. They want to test Primordial Sword Immortal. Do you think that Dark Demon Snake is from the Federation or from overseas?” An Tianzuo looked at the video and asked An Sheng.</p>
<p>“Both are possible, but I think the possibility of it coming from overseas is higher,” An Sheng replied.</p>
<p>“Why?” An Tianzuo asked An Sheng with interest.</p>
<p>“Although we haven’t found out who the owner of Primordial Sword Immortal is yet, based on its appearance and other aspects, the possibility of it being a Companion Beast in the Federation is very high. Logically speaking, the overseas faction should be more eager to understand its abilities,” An Sheng replied.</p>
<p>“That makes sense. Let’s see how much strength that Dark Demon Snake can force out of Primordial Sword Immortal.” An Tianzuo’s gaze landed on the screen again.</p>
<p>596 Azure and Purple Ligh</p>
<p>All the factions that were interested in the divine fruits were also paying close attention to this battle. In order to obtain the right to pluck a divine fruit, one had to defeat Primordial Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>However, no one knew what kind of abilities Primordial Sword Immortal had for it to be given such an evaluation by the cube. It had always been ranked first; no Companion Beast could pose a threat to it.</p>
<p>Even the powerful Mythical Companion Beast like Death of the Underworld could only rank beneath it.</p>
<p>The Federation knew more about Death of the Underworld. It was considered one of the top Companion Beasts among the six families. Its strength was just terrifying.</p>
<p>Dark Demon Snake was a huge snake. At this moment, it was coiled on the cube’s platform, waiting for Primordial Sword Immortal to accept the challenge.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Primordial Sword Immortal accepted the challenge without letting the spectators wait too long. With a flash, a sheathed stone ancient sword appeared on the platform.</p>
<p>Primordial Sword Immortal was actually just a stone sword. There wasn’t any immortal, so it was a question whether to call it a sword immortal or an immortal sword.</p>
<p>The stone sword was grayish-white in color. The scabbard and hilt were carved from ancient gray stone. Only the guard was embedded with a ruby.</p>
<p>As no one had seen it unsheathed, no one knew what the sword looked like on the inside.</p>
<p>Dark Demon Snake didn’t hesitate when it saw the Primordial Sword Immortal appear. It used its strongest force.</p>
<p>Dark Demon Snake’s master clearly knew that it was no match for Primordial Sword Immortal. They only wanted to force out the strength of Primordial Sword Immortal as much as possible.</p>
<p>Dark Demon Snake opened its mouth and spat out a turbulent Dark Demon Tide. Like a tidal wave, it drowned the cube’s platform. Once one was stuck in it, they would be demonized by it.</p>
<p>Primordial Sword Immortal remained suspended silently in midair. Just as it was about to be drowned by the Dark Demon Tide, the ruby at the guard suddenly lit up.</p>
<p>A red sword beam shot out from the ruby and instantly penetrated Dark Demon Snake’s head. It killed it without giving it a chance of surrendering.</p>
<p>The spectators looked at each other. Although they knew that Primordial Sword Immortal would definitely win, they never expected it to win so easily. The sword wasn’t even unsheathed.</p>
<p>“Who is the owner of Primordial Sword Immortal? We have to find out no matter what.” Senator Cape stared at Primordial Sword Immortal on the screen and issued the strict order.</p>
<p>The other families and even those overseas gave the same order.</p>
<p>On the rankings, Primordial Sword Immortal was indeed very strong. Even though people had yet to see the true strength of Primordial Sword Immortal, just that strike alone was enough to make one feel fear.</p>
<p>The six families did not have absolute confidence in defeating Primordial Sword Immortal on the platform. Even if they could defeat it, they would have to pay a huge price.</p>
<p>However, things were different if they could find the owner of Primordial Sword Immortal. No matter how powerful a Companion Beast was, its owner was at most at the Epic stage. Dealing with an Epic human was naturally much easier than dealing with the terrifying Primordial Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>The rules in the arena were fixed, but in reality, there were many ways to clinch victory. There was no need to defeat Primordial Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were on White Cloud Mountain, so they had no idea what had happened. Over the past few days, they had been constantly training themselves.</p>
<p>The jade infant had absorbed a lot of taboo power and had started undergoing some changes. The treasure glow on its body intensified, but within two days of absorbing the taboo power, not much more happened. It looked like the taboo power here was useless against the jade infant.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to use the Demon Suppression statues to stimulate the jade infant for continual evolution.</p>
<p>This actually worked. However, this way, Zhou Wen joined Li Xuan in his predicament. Li Xuan suffered injuries every time he entered Jade Emperor Peak.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen approached the Demon Suppression statues once and the jade infant nearly exploded. It needed half a day of rest before it could completely digest the powerful taboo power that it had absorbed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took the opportunity to continue grinding while the jade infant digested the forbidden power. The time needed for Explosive Fiend Man to cast Time-Blast was just too long. With the time needed, Zhou Wen might as well farm Medusa a few more times. After grinding for so long, he still failed to get a Medusa Companion Egg. He did grind quite a number of Essence Energy Skill Crystals, but his stats were insufficient, so he couldn’t absorb them. In the end, he had to lose them with each respawn.</p>
<p>Ding! When Zhou Wen was farming the Golden Battle God Halberd again, another Golden Battle God Halberd Companion Egg dropped. Its stats and skills were very similar to the first Golden Battle God Halberd.</p>
<p>With the second Golden Battle God Halberd, Zhou Wen held one while the other outside of the game auto-attacked. Killing Mythical creatures became much easier and faster.</p>
<p>However, he felt that having two Golden Battle God Halberds made one of them a little redundant.</p>
<p>If only I could fuse it. Zhou Wen looked at it and realized that the Golden Battle God Halberd could indeed be fused. However, its compatibility with ordinary Epic Companion Beasts wasn’t very high, so he temporarily didn’t have a good candidate. He had to dispel this thought.</p>
<p>After grinding the rare dimensional creatures, Zhou Wen went to Deer Terrace Pavilion. With the four Mythical Companion Beasts, he could storm his way onto Deer Terrace Pavilion even without using Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to kill the six Mythical fox demons, he suddenly felt a glow appear in front of him. He looked up and saw the scene of Jade Immortal Palace appear above the sea of clouds.</p>
<p>“The immortal palace phenomenon! Li Xuan, quickly close your eyes,” Zhou Wen hurriedly reminded Li Xuan.</p>
<p>As they hadn’t seen any immortal palace phenomena over the past few days, Li Xuan usually didn’t wear the balaclava.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Li Xuan knew that the immortal palace phenomenon was dangerous, so he usually didn’t look into the sky. He only looked in the direction of the Jade Emperor Peak. At that moment, he was recovering from his injuries, so he had his eyes closed.</p>
<p>When Li Xuan heard that, he hurriedly took out the balaclava and put it on his head to prevent himself from accidentally seeing the immortal palace phenomenon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally wasn’t afraid of the phenomenon. He stared at the pavilions and buildings in the clouds; there were many fairies circling them. However, the immortal palace he saw this time seemed different from what he had seen the last time. He didn’t see the palace from before, nor did he see the fairy who had broken out of the entrance.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was feeling disappointed, he suddenly saw a strange scene appear in the immortal palace’s phenomenon. He saw an azure and a purple beam pass through the immortal palace’s phenomenon like two rainbows, constantly circling and dancing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully looked at the two beams of light, but he couldn’t see them clearly. All he could see was the streams of light dancing in the air. At the same time, two indescribable pressures made his heart tremble. He felt as though his body was about to be penetrated by the two beams of light at any moment. </p>
<h3 id='chapter597'>Chapter 597 Absolute Strength</h3>
<p>Two streams of light—one azure and one purple—danced amidst the immortal palace. Even the fairies and immortal children avoided them, afraid that they wouldn’t be able to dodge in time. Instantly, chaos broke out. Even the jade buildings that were touched by the two streams of light cracked.Zhou Wen couldn’t see what was inside the two streams of light, but just by looking at their auras, he felt an indomitable aura. It was as though everything in the world would be mercilessly sliced apart if they stood in front of these two beams.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen’s willpower was extremely firm. Otherwise, just the aura of the purple and azure light would have left him shuddering.</p>
<p>Just as he was wondering what the two beams of light were, he suddenly saw them separate. The azure light landed on the top of a jade pavilion and the purple light landed on a small building.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen see that the azure light was an azure bird. The purple light was a purple bird. The two birds looked somewhat similar. They had long feathers and phoenix tails. Their bodies glowed with immortal light and they looked extremely beautiful.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what birds they were, but the moment they spread their wings and took off, Zhou Wen saw their flying stance and was immediately amazed.</p>
<p>This only lasted for an instant. Zhou Wen could only see their taking-off postures. After they took off, he couldn’t see their figures again. All he could see were two streams of light—one azure, one purple—that danced around the immortal palace.</p>
<p>After watching for a moment, the immortal palace phenomenon vanished. However, the flying stance of the azure and purple birds was imprinted in Zhou Wen’s mind, unable to be dispelled.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, what’s in that phenomenon? Tell me about it.” Unable to see it, Li Xuan was burning with curiosity as he asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“There’s an immortal palace in the phenomenon. There are pavilions and buildings. Fairies and immortal children dance among them. There are two birds—one azure, and one purple bird…” Zhou Wen roughly described it.</p>
<p>After the phenomenon, Zhou Wen kept pondering over the flying stance of the two birds. He had a nagging feeling that the stance was very different from the fairy’s flying stance. It was two completely different styles.</p>
<p>I wonder if I can fuse the flying stances of the two birds into my movement technique. Unfortunately, I only saw their flying postures. There’s too little information I can use for reference. As he was pondering, he felt an intense idea come to mind.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted when he analyzed it. He hurriedly looked at the chaos space and saw that Tyrant Behemoth had finally finished evolving. It had already broken out of its shell.</p>
<p>A terrifying beast that resembled a mountain stood in the chaos space. Its body was like black iron. It had two horns on its head and its tail was like a gigantic whip. Its claws were like metal hooks.</p>
<p>A motorcycle that Zhou Wen placed in the chaos space was as tiny as an ant in front of the behemoth. Zhou Wen couldn’t even estimate how big it was.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was naturally happy that Tyrant Behemoth had advanced to the Mythical stage, but this size put him in a difficult spot. Where could he put such a huge Companion Beast?</p>
<p>It was fine in the chaos space, but if it came out, Jade Emperor Peak probably couldn’t contain its body.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was in the middle of this dilemma, he saw Tyrant Behemoth slowly shrink. In just a moment, it changed from a mountain-like beast to about three meters tall.</p>
<p>Can it actually shrink? Zhou Wen was overjoyed. He summoned Tyrant Behemoth back to him and entered the game to check its information.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth: Mythical (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Extreme Strength</p>
<p>Life Soul: Violent Crown</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Absolute Strength</p>
<p>Strength: 81</p>
<p>Speed: 81</p>
<p>Constitution: 81</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 81</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Mountain Consuming</p>
<p>Companion Form: Boxing Glove</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth’s stats were very good. Just like Torch Dragon, every stat reached 81 points. Everything else was the same as before it evolved.</p>
<p>However, after advancing to the Mythical stage, he gained the Wheel of Destiny—Absolute Strength. Zhou Wen had only learned that for every action, there was an equal and opposite reaction. He didn’t know what Absolute Strength was, but he carefully checked its description.</p>
<p>Absolute Strength: A miracle that crushes everything with strength.</p>
<p>Strength can crush everything. How far can it go? Zhou Wen launched a game dungeon and it happened to be in front of Deer Terrace Pavilion. He summoned Tyrant Behemoth to see how strong its Wheel of Destiny was.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar hid outside with Six-Winged, Torch Dragon, and the two Golden Battle God Halberds by its side. However, it didn’t let them enter the ancient building and only allowed Tyrant Behemoth to charge in.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth entered the ancient building and immediately alarmed the six fox immortals. One of them shot out a rainbow beam that slashed at Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth didn’t take action. It opened its mouth and bit down, sucking the light into its stomach as though it was drinking cold water.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, this Mythical Mountain Consuming Skill is quite powerful. It can even devour a Mythical Essence Energy Skill. Zhou Wen was delighted.</p>
<p>The six fox immortals attacked Tyrant Behemoth one after another. Tyrant Behemoth opened its mouth and swallowed all sorts of Essence Energy Skills. It was insolent, violent, and unreasonable.</p>
<p>The six fox immortals weren’t stupid. They attacked Tyrant Behemoth from different directions, but all Tyrant Behemoth did was open its mouth and they were immediately left helpless.</p>
<p>All sorts of colorful light struck Tyrant Behemoth’s body. Tyrant Behemoth roared and a crown appeared on its head. Its physique immediately increased drastically as it forcefully used its body to tank the rainbow light. The fox immortals’ attacks could only leave a shallow wound on its body.</p>
<p>However, the fox immortals specialized in movement techniques and illusions. Tyrant Behemoth’s speed and strength were much stronger than theirs, but it failed to hit them. Often, a fierce claw strike only struck their phantoms.</p>
<p>In its rage, Behemoth finally used its Wheel of Destiny. A black light emitted from Tyrant Behemoth’s body as though all light had been absorbed by it.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The floor beneath Behemoth’s feet collapsed, but it wasn’t just the floor. Even space seemed to be crushed by its strength, creating a spatial vortex.</p>
<p>Everything around it flew towards Behemoth. It was like a black hole, sucking everything around it.</p>
<p>The six fox immortals were no exception. They struggled to escape, but the powerful suction force made it difficult for them to move.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth charged forward and smashed the six fox immortals into pieces with one punch after another. The six fox immortals counterattacked with all their might, but their attacks left zero effect when landing on Tyrant Behemoth’s body. It was akin to scratching an itch. When Tyrant Behemoth landed a punch on them, it directly shattered their bodies. Their strengths were on completely different levels.</p>
<p>How mighty! It’s thrashing them despite it being one against six. Zhou Wen was overjoyed. With Tyrant Behemoth, he didn’t need to go through so much trouble to kill Qiongqi.</p>
<h3 id='chapter598'>Chapter 598 There“s a Demon at the Bottom of the Mountain</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen was thinking of getting Tyrant Behemoth to ascend to the second and third floor to kill the Nine-Headed Pheasant Spirit and Jade Lute Spirit.With Absolute Strength, Tyrant Behemoth remained completely immune to their attacks. All sorts of aural attacks landed on Tyrant Behemoth’s body, but they didn’t hurt at all. However, they could only use their movement techniques and speed to circle around Tyrant Behemoth. Otherwise, they would have died from a single punch from it.</p>
<p>What was terrifying was that Absolute Strength caused space to collapse. It produced a suction force that resembled gravity, hindering their movement and speed. They didn’t last long before they were killed by Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth alone had stormed through three levels of the ancient building. Before that, only Torch Dragon could do it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was excited. He was just about to take Tyrant Behemoth to Zhuolu’s underground temples to see if it could kill Qiongqi when he realized that Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength couldn’t be used again.</p>
<p>What the hell… Does absolute Strength still have a time limit? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>However, on second thought, it made sense. This was equivalent to an invincible state. It was impossible for there to be no restrictions. Otherwise, wouldn’t Tyrant Behemoth really be invincible?</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen grinded dungeons, he waited for Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength to finish the cooldown. He waited 24 hours before he could use it again.</p>
<p>Charging for twenty-four hours for half an hour of usage. It is a little short, but the pro is that it’s for invincibility. Zhou Wen was satisfied. Half an hour’s invincibility should be enough for him to do many things.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen led Tyrant Behemoth and the other Mythical Companion Beasts into the Zhuolu underground temple with great aplomb. When he arrived at the Aoyin stone statue, for no reason, a sudden thought came to him. He planned on getting Tyrant Behemoth to kill Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>Which one is stronger? Absolute Strength or Bright Torch Vision World? Zhou Wen got Tyrant Behemoth to use Absolute Strength before charging into the Torch Dragon temple.</p>
<p>However, without any room for suspense, Tyrant Behemoth was directly reflected by the vision world. Its Absolute Strength failed to protect its body.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth’s strength can even crush space. Can’t it distort Torch Dragon’s gaze? Zhou Wen had no choice but to use his old method to deal with Torch Dragon. It wasn’t easy for him to kill the Torch Dragon youngling, but nothing dropped.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Primordial Sword Immortal remained at the top of the rankings with no one questioning its placing. Ever since the Dark Demon Snake was killed, another two Mythical Companion Beasts had challenged it, but the outcome was the same. They were unable to force the stone sword out of its scabbard. The sword beam from the ruby was something they couldn’t withstand.</p>
<p>However, the Companion Beasts that challenged Primordial Sword Immortal survived. They weren’t killed like the Dark Demon Snake. Their owners were already prepared.</p>
<p>It was naturally a good thing that they could survive, but to not have the qualifications to make Primordial Sword Immortal unsheath itself made many people who wanted to vie for first place, secretly frown.</p>
<p>Unless one sent a top Mythical creature to fight it, it was very difficult to figure out Primordial Sword Immortal’s plethora of abilities.</p>
<p>However, up till now, no one was willing to reveal their top combat strength and fight to the death with Primordial Sword Immortal. Everyone was just watching.</p>
<p>During this period of time, a Companion Beast challenged the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, but because Zhou Wen was on White Cloud Mountain, he didn’t have the chance to receive the news about him being challenged. Therefore, after 72 hours, the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon automatically admitted defeat and gave up its original position.</p>
<p>An Sheng had also sent a message to Zhou Wen, but because there was no signal on White Cloud Mountain, Zhou Wen didn’t receive it.</p>
<p>“Haha… I’ve finally succeeded…” A couple of weeks later, on White Cloud Mountain’s Jade Emperor Peak, Li Xuan laughed out loud in excitement.</p>
<p>His body stood on the stone steps as the carapace on his body shattered and healed itself. The self-healing speed was even faster than the shattering. The taboo power on Jade Emperor Peak failed to kill Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Old Li, your self-healing powers are impressive! It’s an undying body,” Zhou Wen exclaimed. He was indeed envious of Li Xuan’s self-healing abilities.</p>
<p>Although Small Perfection of Wisdom also had Constitution enhancement, it was very different from the typical Constitution enhancement. In terms of self-healing, it was far inferior to Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“It’s indeed good, but it freaking hurts!” Li Xuan retreated out of the Jade Emperor Peak and said with gritted teeth.</p>
<p>The wounds could heal, but the pain from the injuries remained.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, I have to head back now. Do you want to go back together?” Li Xuan asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I still need to cultivate here for a period of time. You go back. By the way, remember to prepare the things I asked you to buy for me. I’ll be needing them when I return in a few days.” Zhou Wen still remembered the items The Thearch wanted. They weren’t anything valuable, so there was no need to fall out with her over this.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen was very interested in The Thearch’s Pet Skill Insights Agent.</p>
<p>Typically, Companion Beasts that dropped wouldn’t have all their skills, especially Mythical pets. Most Mythical creatures had plenty of skills, but Companion Eggs that dropped typically only had four skills. If the Pet Skill Insights Agent was useful, it might allow Mythical Companion Beasts to have all their skills.</p>
<p>Just like the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, it lacked several skills. If it could comprehend those skills, its combat strength would increase a little.</p>
<p>“I got the purchasing department to buy it. It’s almost done. I’ll go back and take a look. If there’s anything missing, I’ll get them to quickly purchase it. I’ll head back first.” Li Xuan couldn’t wait to return home.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sent him off White Cloud Mountain before returning to Jade Emperor Peak. However, just as he came in front of the door to Jade Emperor Peak, he looked up and trembled.</p>
<p>At the end of the Jade Emperor Peak’s stone steps stood a white-robed, white-haired man. He stood in front of the Demon Suppression statues and looked at Zhou Wen with a smile.</p>
<p>“Teacher!” Zhou Wen called out, but he didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>“I’ve implicated many of you, yet you are still willing to call me teacher. It makes me feel ashamed,” Wang Mingyuan sighed.</p>
<p>“You taught me before. It’s only right for me to call you teacher.” Zhou Wen looked at Wang Mingyuan and continued, “Teacher, can I ask you why you are using the divine fruit to initiate the ranking battles?”</p>
<p>“If I tell you that I only wish to give the fruit to someone, would you believe me?” Wang Mingyuan said with a faint smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say a word, but Wang Mingyuan laughed. “You’re still the same as before. You haven’t changed at all. You’re so stubborn and don’t know how to hide your feelings.”</p>
<p>“Teacher, you aren’t here just to tell me this, right?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I came here to retrieve something, but I never expected to meet you. Since we are fated to meet again and you are still willing to call me teacher, I’ll tell you a secret.” Wang Mingyuan pointed at his feet and said, “There’s a demon at the bottom of the mountain. It can help you break through to the Mythical stage.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter599'>Chapter 599 Demon Suppression Hall</h3>
<p>“What demon?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.“It’s just a title. You can also call him Guardian,” Wang Mingyuan answered.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to advance to the Mythical stage like you using Spirit Casting on a Guardian?” Zhou Wen asked Wang Mingyuan. He actually wanted to know if Wang Mingyuan had advanced to the Mythical stage using Spirit Casting or not.</p>
<p>“Did Ziya give you the Spirit Casting Skill?” Wang Mingyuan frowned slightly.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan sighed and said, “The body of humans is innately lacking. If you wish to advance to the Mythical stage, you must have a way to make up for it. Now, there are two viable paths. First, it’s to form a contract with a Guardian to advance to the Mythical stage with the body of a Guardian. This path looks simple, but in fact, it has extremely high requirements. It’s very difficult to get a Guardian’s acknowledgment if one doesn’t have a compatible physique and talent. Even if one obtains the recognition, they will be abandoned if they fail to meet the Guardian’s requirements in their future growth and in combat. By choosing this path, it’s equivalent to boarding a train that can’t be stopped. There’s no chance of retreating. Once it fails, one will be left with nothing as they fall to the lowest point possible.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Wang Mingyuan continued, “The second path is Spirit Casting. By borrowing the bodies of powerful creatures to make up for your shortcomings, one can choose Mythical creatures or Guardians as targets for Spirit Casting. Both have their pros and cons, but using a Guardian will make one remain more human. After Spirit Casting, your body will still maintain most of its human form, but that’s all.”</p>
<p>What Wang Mingyuan said was similar to Zhou Wen’s previous guess. He couldn’t help but ask, “Can’t humans really rely on their bodies to advance to the Mythical stage?”</p>
<p>“Difficult.” Wang Mingyuan looked at the churning sea of clouds beyond the mountain and said, “Everything has its limits. Just like many human sports before the dimensional storms, such as a one-hundred-meter sprint. It’s relatively easy to raise the results at the beginning, but when the results reached about ten seconds, the chances of a breakthrough were minimal. This is because ten seconds was the limit of humans. What humans are facing now is the same problem. If the limits of human bodies are 10, then the requirement to advance to the Mythical stage is 100. No matter how hard humanity works, it’s impossible to reach 100. This is a limit we were born with. It’s difficult to resolve it without external help.”</p>
<p>With that said, without waiting for Zhou Wen to say a word, Wang Mingyuan said, “I should go. The demon at the foot of the mountain is a Guardian. If you wish to contract it, you can use this method. Even if your physique and talent aren’t compatible with him, he will still contract with you. Furthermore, he won’t easily betray you.”</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan reached out and flicked a piece of paper at Zhou Wen. When Zhou Wen caught it and looked at Wang Mingyuan again, he saw him turn around and walk into a huge spatial door.</p>
<p>After Wang Mingyuan walked in, the spatial door closed with a bang. Jade Emperor Peak returned to normal. There was nothing besides the two Demon Suppression statues as though no one had ever been there.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared blankly for a moment before retracting his gaze to look at the note in his hand.</p>
<p>The content on it was somewhat unbelievable. Zhou Wen definitely wouldn’t believe it if it had come from someone else. However, the person who wrote this was Wang Mingyuan, so it was naturally a whole different matter.</p>
<p>Should I give it a try? Zhou Wen looked at the slip of paper with a strange expression. This was because the method on the slip was rather unbelievable.</p>
<p>Gods Retreat has yet to advance to a Perfect Body, so I can’t enter Demon Suppression Hall. If I wish to enter, I can only try using the method on this. Zhou Wen decided to give it a try at night. Even if he failed, he wouldn’t suffer any losses.</p>
<p>There was still a long time before sunset. Zhou Wen sat on the stone steps and thought of what Wang Mingyuan had said to him.</p>
<p>Is there really no way to advance to the Mythical stage with the human body? If I’m really at an impasse, which path should I choose? Spirit Casting or contracting? Zhou Wen ultimately felt that he didn’t want to choose either path.</p>
<p>I’ll decide after advancing Slaughterer to a Perfect Body. It’s still too early to consider such things now. Zhou Wen thought of the divine fruit again.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan said that he only wanted to give the divine fruit away. Although it wasn’t necessarily credible, Wang Mingyuan didn’t need to go through so much trouble to lie to him if he wanted to harm him.</p>
<p>Since Wang Mingyuan said that there are only two ways to advance to the Mythical stage, that meant that the divine fruit isn’t able to advance humans to the Mythical stage. In that case, the divine fruit is only effective against Companion Beasts and dimensional creatures. Zhou Wen felt that he could give it a try to see if he could vie for the divine fruit.</p>
<p>If he could really obtain the divine fruit, he could feed it to either Banana Fairy or Explosive Fiend Man—especially Explosive Fiend Man. Once he advanced to the Mythical stage, he would be of great help to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Even if that divine fruit is a trap, Teacher probably won’t cheat me on account of our teacher-student relationship, right? After some thought, Zhou Wen felt that vying for the divine fruit had more pros than cons.</p>
<p>The crux of the matter was whether he could obtain first place as well as decide which Companion Beast to vie for first place.</p>
<p>I wonder if Tyrant can handle Primordial Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>Time passed as Zhou Wen pondered. The sun quickly set and the sky darkened.</p>
<p>I’ll give it a try and see if Teacher’s method really works. Zhou Wen looked at the sky that had completely darkened and a crescent moon emitted a faint light.</p>
<p>Looking at the two Demon Suppression statues in front of the Demon Suppression Hall, Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and turned his back to them. Then, he pressed his hands on the stone steps and held himself up vertically.</p>
<p>With his hands as his feet, Zhou Wen moved towards the door of Demon Suppression Hall.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a little uneasy as he looked at the two Demon Suppression statues. He didn’t feel confident at all.</p>
<p>Gods Retreat was powerful, yet it couldn’t even cross the Demon Suppression statues to enter the hall. Yet, Wang Mingyuan said that he could enter just by walking upside down. This was unbelievable.</p>
<p>If Wang Mingyuan hadn’t been the one informing him of this method, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have even tried it. It sounded like a joke.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was making an attempt, he still found it unbelievable that he could enter the Demon Suppression Hall so easily.</p>
<p>When he was close to activating the Demon Suppression statues, the two words—Demon Suppression—on their respective foreheads lit up again.</p>
<p>Will it really work? Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, although the word Demon Suppression on the two statues lit up, Zhou Wen didn’t feel the pressure on the jade infant increase.</p>
<p>Is it really feasible? Zhou Wen continued moving upwards. Indeed, he didn’t feel the pressure from the Demon Suppression words. Just like that, he reached the end of the stone steps and arrived at the entrance of the Demon Suppression Hall.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen still remembered the method on the slip of paper. He didn’t use his feet to kick the door, nor did he push it with his hands. Instead, he used his hands to prop himself up on the ground and slammed his head against the door of the Demon Suppression Hall.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>With a dull thud, Zhou Wen felt his head spin as he saw stars.</p>
