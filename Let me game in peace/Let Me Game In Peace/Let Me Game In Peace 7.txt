<h3 id='chapter600'>Chapter 600 The Imprisoned Guardian</h3>
<p>What happened to definitely opening when hitting the door with all my might? Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and prevented himself from falling to the ground. Then, he heard a rumbling sound as the door slowly rose. It opened.Zhou Wen suspected that there was no need for him to slam the door with all his strength as Wang Mingyuan had said. However, Zhou Wen didn’t have any evidence.</p>
<p>After the door rose, Zhou Wen saw the scene in the temple. There weren’t any statues of consecrated deities or predellas. There were many stone monuments scattered in the hall.</p>
<p>There were many strange lines and patterns engraved on each stone monument. He did not know what they meant.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood outside the door and counted. Indeed, it was arranged exactly as drawn on the slip of paper.</p>
<p>As he alternated his hands to move forward, Zhou Wen followed the path Wang Mingyuan had described and entered the stone monument’s formation. When he passed some stone monuments, he propped himself up with one hand and pressed the stone monument with the other.</p>
<p>After circling the stone monument array for a while, he finally finished all necessary actions. The stone monument spun, revealing a stone staircase that led underground.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly entered the stone steps and finally heaved a sigh of relief. He placed his feet on the ground and returned to his normal state.</p>
<p>He sized up the stone staircase and saw that the stone walls on both sides were engraved with symbols that Zhou Wen knew nothing of. Most of them were simple lines and points that were arranged in a certain way.</p>
<p>He walked down the stone steps all the way. Before long, the stone steps turned a little. They continued downwards, like the stairs in a building.</p>
<p>He walked all the way down. After walking for more than a hundred storeys worth of steps, he still couldn’t see the end. The patterns on the stone wall remained, but he didn’t know what they were for.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen thought that there was no end, he saw that the stone steps below were somewhat different.</p>
<p>The stone steps below turned into jade and emitted a cold aura.</p>
<p>After stepping onto the jade stairs, he continued walking down. Not long after, he reached the end. Beneath him was a room made of jade. Floating in the middle of the room was a black cocoon.</p>
<p>There were many cracks on the cocoon’s body as black gas seeped out from the cracks. However, the black gas failed to emit as it was absorbed by the white circles on the black cocoon’s body.</p>
<p>There were a total of seven circles on the black cocoon. They looked like they were made of jade and had mysterious incantations engraved on them.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen looked at the black cocoon, he suddenly realized that a black eye was staring at him through a crack.</p>
<p>“Human, do you want me to become your contractor?” When Zhou Wen saw the eye, he heard an ethereal voice coming from the black cocoon.</p>
<p>“No,” Zhou Wen answered without any hesitation.</p>
<p>He could naturally tell that there was something wrong with the Guardian inside the black cocoon.</p>
<p>There was no Mythical creature guarding him here, and the black cocoon was clearly imprisoned. This was completely different from the Guardians that Zhou Wen had seen before.</p>
<p>“Human, don’t you wish to obtain powerful strength? As long as you form a contract with me, you can obtain immense power and advance to the Mythical stage.” The voice from the black cocoon sounded again.</p>
<p>“If you were really that strong, you wouldn’t have been imprisoned here.” Zhou Wen said, but he thought to himself, Who has the ability to imprison a Guardian here? Is it a human? I’m afraid humans don’t have such powerful abilities.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, the black cocoon’s Guardian seemed to turn irascible. Large amounts of black demonic aura surged out of the cracks. Due to the massive amount of demonic aura that they absorbed, even the jade hoops turned raven-black.</p>
<p>“Human, I’m the strongest Guardian. No one can imprison me. I was the one who imprisoned myself.” The black cocoon’s voice sounded again.</p>
<p>“Then why did you imprison yourself?” Zhou Wen naturally didn’t believe him.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to know the reason. All you need to know is that after signing a contract with me, you will become the most powerful human, and you will become the most powerful existence in the future. That’s enough. The power I will give you is something you humans can never imagine, even in your dreams,” the voice said again.</p>
<p>“I heard that signing a contract with a Guardian requires a special physique and talent. Are you sure that my physique and talent are what you need?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“You being able to come here proves that you have the qualifications to sign a contract with me,” said the Guardian in the cocoon.</p>
<p>“Sounds good, but isn’t it because you are just looking for any random human to contract with so you can escape?” Zhou Wen curled his lips.</p>
<p>“Human, it looks like you don’t understand how great an opportunity you will miss.” The Guardian continued, “Don’t tell me you don’t wish for strength? Don’t you wish to become the greatest hero of humanity? In the future, there will definitely be a terrifying battle in the human world. When that happens, no one will be spared. Those below the Mythical stage don’t even have the right to struggle for survival. Sign a contract with me and you will still have a chance of survival. Otherwise, you can only wait for death. This is your chance to live.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to scare me. I don’t believe anything you say.” Zhou Wen looked at the black cocoon and asked, “After talking for so long, I still don’t know your name?”</p>
<p>“Grim Demon,” said the voice from the black cocoon.</p>
<p>“Dim Demon?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. The name sounded a little odd. Was he dim?</p>
<p>Grim Demon clearly heard Zhou Wen’s pronunciation error. Demonic aura spewed out from the black cocoon as though it was furious. “A fiend born to kill, I’m the grim reaper incarnate, Grim Demon.”</p>
<p>“So it’s Grim Demon. This name… is domineering…” Zhou Wen said, but due to his preconceived impression, he couldn’t forget the name “Dim Demon.”</p>
<p>“Human, have you thought it through? As long as you contract with me, not only will you be able to survive in the terrifying battle, you will also have the chance to defeat all the species in the universe and become the strongest existence…” Grim Demon continued.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen many Guardians before, but they weren’t anything impressive either. They weren’t as powerful as you say.” Zhou Wen wore a questioning look.</p>
<p>“Guardians differ in strength too. Which Guardians have you seen?” Grim Demon didn’t believe Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen a seraphim with six wings. He can open the Door to Heaven. It looks rather impressive,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That birdman, I can tear it apart with one hand. It’s not worth mentioning at all. After signing the contract with me, it will be easy for you to defeat him,” Grim Demon said disdainfully.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, Just keep bragging. After all, bragging isn’t against the law. But I can’t verify it either.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t say it out loud. He continued, “I’ve also seen a Guardian named Fairy Burial. She looked pretty impressive.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter601'>Chapter 601 Grim Demon</h3>
<p>Grim Demon clearly paused for a moment before saying, “Fairy Burial does have some ability, but she’s not my match either.”“I’ve also seen a Guardian before…” Zhou Wen described the Guardian of Ant City.</p>
<p>Grim Demon said coldly, “I’ve never heard of such a Guardian. It probably isn’t that strong. I’ll also be able to easily kill it.”</p>
<p>“You said you were powerful, but there’s no way to prove it. How do you want me to believe you?” Zhou Wen didn’t believe in the bragging of Grim Demon. He then asked, “How is the strength of Guardians demarcated?”</p>
<p>“You will find out after contracting me.” Grim Demon didn’t answer Zhou Wen’s question.</p>
<p>“Forget it. The other Guardians have Mythical creatures protecting them. Only you are imprisoned here. It’s obvious that you aren’t that great. You might very well be the weakest Guardian. I think I’ll find another Guardian,” Zhou Wen said, preparing to turn around and leave.</p>
<p>Grim Demon nearly died from exasperation because of Zhou Wen. He gritted his teeth and said, “Human, after I leave, I can naturally prove to you that I’m powerful.”</p>
<p>“Forget it. I heard that a person can only contract one Guardian. I still wish to leave my contract opportunity to a stronger Guardian. Even if it’s not a top-notch Guardian, it needs to be at least average. You don’t meet my requirements.” Zhou Wen shook his head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t want to contract a Guardian at all. He only entered to take a look.</p>
<p>The method Wang Mingyuan had given him was to force Grim Demon to sign a special contract. Then, Grim Demon couldn’t easily betray him like the other Guardians.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen felt that such a contract wasn’t too safe. Although the special contract prevented the Guardian from defecting, the Guardian could still regain his freedom if his master died.</p>
<p>If Grim Demon really had the intention to betray him, he could plot his death before obtaining freedom.</p>
<p>The demonic aura in the black cocoon surged like a tidal wave. The seven jade hoops were unable to completely block the demonic aura. The mysterious incantations and patterns on the jade room’s walls lit up.</p>
<p>All sorts of patterns lit up on the stone walls of the tunnel. They suppressed the terrifying demonic aura, illuminating the entire mountain belly.</p>
<p>Grim Demon was truly infuriated. He wished he could tear this human to pieces.</p>
<p>He had never suffered such humiliation. If he wasn’t trapped here, even if Zhou Wen knelt down to beg him for a contract, he would have to consider Zhou Wen’s aptitude and talent before making an informed decision.</p>
<p>Now that he was lowering himself and taking the initiative to form a contract with Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen was still so picky. He even said something that he needed one that was at least average. This nearly made Grim Demon go mad.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t been suppressed by Demon Suppression Mountain and unable to use his powers to harm Zhou Wen, he would choose to kill Zhou Wen first to appease his anger even if he had to wait another few decades or a century.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be alarmed when he saw how powerful Grim Demon was when in a rage. This fellow isn’t completely bragging. He might really be able to fight Fairy Burial.</p>
<p>“Don’t be angry. If it wasn’t because you were too weak, why would you be imprisoned here by humans?” Zhou Wen wanted to see if he could obtain some secrets.</p>
<p>These Guardians seemed to come from different species. It was unknown why the species of dimensional zones had created them and allowed them to contract with humans.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to know. If you don’t wish to sign a contract, scram. Don’t disturb my slumber,” Grim Demon said coldly.</p>
<p>“Wait, I just said that you were imprisoned here by humans. You didn’t refute me. Could it be that you were really imprisoned here by us humans?” Zhou Wen suddenly realized a problem. When he spoke just now, he had said it subconsciously.</p>
<p>However, from Grim Demon’s point of view, he looked down on humans. He should have retorted when he heard Zhou Wen’s words.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen waited for a while, but Grim Demon didn’t say a word. There was no reaction from the black cocoon.</p>
<p>It can’t be. Was this fellow really imprisoned here by humans? Look at how dim and silly he is. Could it be that he was trapped here because of a human scheme? The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that it was right.</p>
<p>However, after saying a few more words, Grim Demon didn’t react at all. From the looks of it, he planned on ignoring him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s hope of learning more insider stories was shattered. Seeing that there was nothing else here, all he could do was retreat and return to Jade Emperor Peak.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have too many secrets about me. Otherwise, it would be a good choice to contract with Grim Demon. That fellow’s strength is indeed extraordinary.</p>
<p>With so many secrets about him, he definitely couldn’t let a Guardian with self-awareness and independent behavior follow him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used the Demon Suppression power on Jade Emperor Peak to raise Gods Retreat. Occasionally, when he was free, he would run down to take a look at Grim Demon and attempt to chat with him, hoping to obtain more information.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after Grim Demon realized that he wasn’t willing to contract, he ignored him. Occasionally, he would say a few words, but there were no secrets to speak of.</p>
<p>During this period, Zhou Wen also discovered something. Indeed, there was no need for him to slam the door with all his might. All he needed to do was gently hit it to have it open.</p>
<p>Is it fun to trick me? Zhou Wen gritted his teeth, but there was nothing he could do.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen finally understood that neither Wang Mingyuan nor his disciples were decent and serious people. He definitely couldn’t believe their words completely.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also tried entering the Demon Suppression Hall in-game. Wang Mingyuan’s method was equally effective in-game. There was a black cocoon and Grim Demon down below in-game.</p>
<p>However, Grim Demon didn’t speak in-game, so there was no way to communicate.</p>
<p>“Grim Demon, have you heard of a Guardian with the word ‘Thearch’ in its name?” Zhou Wen had always suspected that The Thearch might also be a Guardian.</p>
<p>Typical Mythical creatures didn’t seem as intelligent as The Thearch.</p>
<p>“There are naturally Guardians with Thearch in their names, but compared to me, they are far inferior,” Grim Demon said coldly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had come many times. Being bored, Grim Demon would chat with Zhou Wen indifferently at times.</p>
<p>“Then are there any women among these Guardians with Thearch in their names?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“Of course. However, even the strongest Netherworld Female Thearch isn’t my match,” Grim Demon said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already used to the bragging nature of Grim Demon. He wasn’t affected at all as he continued probing, “I’ve been to Chess Mountain before and met a Guardian who calls herself The Thearch. Do you know who she is?”</p>
<p>“What kind of place is Chess Mountain?” Grim Demon frowned.</p>
<p>“It’s probably where ancient Chaoge is. There’s a Deer Terrace Pavilion there…” Zhou Wen revealed some information about Chess Mountain.</p>
<h3 id='chapter602'>Chapter 602 Strange Response of Grim Demon</h3>
<p>Grim Demon didn’t react when he heard that. When he heard Zhou Wen mention the Power of Wishes, he said, “I don’t know. I’ve never heard of it.”Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed. He originally imagined that he would be able to obtain some information regarding The Thearch from him, but he failed to obtain anything.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen attempted to use the jade infant to resist the power of the Demon Suppression statues every day. As he absorbed a large amount of Demon Suppression forces, the treasure glow on the jade infant’s body intensified. Later on, Zhou Wen could hardly see the jade infant in the treasure glow.</p>
<p>Now, the jade infant was almost able to resist the Demon Suppression statues. With the jade infant’s strength, Zhou Wen could rush to the entrance of the Demon Suppression Hall.</p>
<p>However, even so, the jade infant still failed to advance to the legendary Perfect Body.</p>
<p>And at this moment, the power of Demon Suppression was almost negligible to the jade infant. Zhou Wen felt that there was no point in staying any longer. He planned on leaving White Cloud Mountain and returning to school.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen left White Cloud Mountain, he went to inform Grim Demon, “Grim Demon, I’m leaving. Let’s meet again if fate allows it.”</p>
<p>“Are you really not considering signing a contract with me?” There was silence within the black cocoon before the voice of a Grim Demon sounded.</p>
<p>“I don’t have the intention of contracting a Guardian for the time being, but I might be able to help you find someone to become your contractor.” Zhou Wen felt that it was better to find a friend who was willing to contract since he wasn’t willing to do so. It was better than letting an enemy contract Grim Demon.</p>
<p>Although White Cloud Mountain was mysterious and ordinary people couldn’t enter, with the passage of time, the secrets of the various dimensional zones would slowly be resolved. It was difficult to guarantee that no one would enter.</p>
<p>“Do you think I will contract anyone?” Grim Demon said coldly.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll definitely help you find an outstanding human.” Zhou Wen felt that he could return and ask An Sheng or Li Xuan if they wanted to contract the Guardian.</p>
<p>“I’ll take a step back and form an eternal contract with you,” Grim Demon said after a moment of silence. At the same time, he explained what an eternal contract was.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen already knew what an eternal contract was. The contract Wang Mingyuan had wanted him to force Grim Demon to sign was an eternal contract. After signing such a contract, unless Zhou Wen died, Grim Demon wouldn’t be able to obtain freedom.</p>
<p>“I’m really sorry. I just don’t plan on contracting a Guardian at the moment.” Zhou Wen couldn’t accept the circumstances unless he tried advancing to the Mythical stage by himself.</p>
<p>Even though Grim Demon was an excellent choice, Zhou Wen still firmly declined.</p>
<p>“In that case, can you do me a favor before you leave?” Grim Demon said after some thought.</p>
<p>“What favor?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I have an Essence Energy Art here. Help me take it out and find a human who can learn it to be my contractor. As a reward, I can agree to do three things for you after I’m out. As long as it’s within my abilities, I will do anything,” said Grim Demon.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Zhou Wen agreed. It didn’t affect him much.</p>
<p>“I’ll reveal my Essence Energy Art outside the cocoon. You have to remember every word.” Accompanying Grim Demon’s voice, the demonic aura in the black cocoon surged and condensed into words.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen memorized the words one by one, but he was also wary. As he memorized them, he kept controlling his Essence Energy to prevent any accidents.</p>
<p>Grim Demon’s Essence Energy Art was just too long. It was like a sutra. Zhou Wen took two to three hours to memorize everything.</p>
<p>“Recite the Essence Energy Art once and I’ll check to see if you make any mistakes,” said Grim Demon.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. Show me the Essence Energy Art again. I’ll just compare,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Grim Demon didn’t persist and displayed his Essence Energy Art again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen read for a while. It had been too long. When it was time to feed Demonic Neonate the Longevity Fruit, he summoned her and handed her one.</p>
<p>The Essence Energy Art on the black cocoon suddenly stopped scrolling. Zhou Wen asked curiously, “Why aren’t you continuing?”</p>
<p>There was still no sound in the black cocoon. The demonic aura also seemed to freeze, motionless.</p>
<p>“Grim Demon, what are you doing?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown, but there was no answer.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly realized that something was amiss. The abnormal actions of Grim Demon seemed to have begun when he summoned Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>He glanced at Demonic Neonate who was chewing on a Longevity Fruit and then at the motionless black cocoon. Zhou Wen pulled Demonic Neonate and nudged her towards the black cocoon.</p>
<p>Finally, the black cocoon reacted. Demonic aura spewed out from the black cocoon, but it didn’t spray at Zhou Wen and Demonic Neonate. Instead, it seemed to lunge the black cocoon back to dodge them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was trapped by the seven jade hoops and the entire mountain’s Demon Suppression array. It was unable to move.</p>
<p>“Don’t come over!” Grim Demon’s voice finally sounded again. However, there was a hint of horror in his voice.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed. Although Demonic Neonate is powerful, her strength isn’t even comparable to the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. Why is Grim Demon so afraid of her?</p>
<p>“Grim Demon, don’t you claim to be the strongest guardian? Why are you so afraid now?” Zhou Wen mocked.</p>
<p>With Grim Demon’s temper, he would definitely retort angrily with the way Zhou Wen mocked him.</p>
<p>However, this time, he didn’t retort. He fell silent again.</p>
<p>Indeed, there’s something odd. Is Grim Demon actually afraid of Demonic Neonate? Is there something on Demonic Neonate that’s worth being afraid of? Zhou Wen carefully sized up Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>He didn’t allow Demonic Neonate to continue approaching the black cocoon. If Grim Demon was just pretending to be afraid, but in fact, had ulterior motives towards Demonic Neonate, wouldn’t Zhou Wen be harming her if he pushed her over?</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate’s strength in every aspect isn’t enough to threaten Grim Demon. If there’s really something that can make him afraid, I’m afraid it’s only her Life Providence, Life Soul, or Wheel of Destiny. Life Providence and Life Soul Wheel seem to have nothing to do with demons. Could it be that Grim Demon fears the Supreme True Demon Life Soul? Many thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind.</p>
<p>The more he thought about it, the more likely it was. However, Zhou Wen had no intention of letting Demonic Neonate take the risk. He turned around and left with Demonic Neonate. He planned on letting Demonic Neonate approach the black cocoon in-game after returning.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen’s Mythical Companion Beasts had increased recently, he seldom used Demonic Neonate in battle. He hadn’t tried getting her to attack the black cocoon.</p>
<p>“Wait.” To his surprise, just as Zhou Wen was about to leave the jade room, the Grim Demon’s voice sounded again to stop him.</p>
<p>Could it be that the Grim Demon really wants to trick Demonic Neonate into going over? Zhou Wen became even more wary as he unsummoned Demonic Neonate to prevent any accidents from happening.</p>
<h3 id='chapter603'>Chapter 603 Master-Slave Contrac</h3>
<p>“Please… Please agree to sign a master-slave contract with me…” Grim Demon’s words left Zhou Wen alarmed.“What’s a master-slave contract?” Zhou Wen learned from Wang Mingyuan the two types of guardian contracts.</p>
<p>One was a Guardian contract. This contract was relatively fair. Both parties could terminate the contract at any time and had the right to give up on each other.</p>
<p>The second was the eternal contract that could only be terminated after one party died. Relatively speaking, it was relatively fair. However, Guardians had unlimited lifespans, so typically speaking, humans would die first before the contract could be terminated.</p>
<p>“I’m willing to sign a contract as a slave. Life and death depend on Master’s will…” Grim Demon explained the effects and methods of the master-slave contract in detail.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen finished hearing the description, he felt that the contract was excellent. Grim Fiend’s life was at his will. Furthermore, if the master died, the Guardian would also die. It was perfect.</p>
<p>With the master-slave contract, Zhou Wen no longer needed to consider his previous worries. It was just too good.</p>
<p>“Since you are so sincere in your request, it wouldn’t be nice for me not to agree. Alright, I’ll agree to be your master,” Zhou Wen agreed readily.</p>
<p>“Who wants you to be my master? I want to invite… that lady… to be my master…” Grim Demon immediately said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression froze as he immediately understood what Grim Demon meant. Grim Demon wanted to sign a master-slave contract with Demonic Neonate, not him.</p>
<p>“You want to sign a master-slave contract with my Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen asked the black cocoon.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Grim Demon replied with certainty.</p>
<p>Could it be that Demonic Neonate really had a huge background when she was alive? Or could it be because of the Supreme True Demon Life Soul she has? Zhou Wen summoned Demonic Neonate again and pointed at the black cocoon, asking her, “Do you know what that is?”</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate looked at the black cocoon and shook her head. Her tiny face was also filled with confusion.</p>
<p>“He wants to be your Guardian. Are you willing?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate shook her head with a blank expression. It was unknown if she knew what a Guardian was.</p>
<p>“As you can see, she’s unwilling to accept you,” Zhou Wen said to the black cocoon.</p>
<p>There was no sound from the black cocoon. Zhou Wen led Demonic Neonate out of the Demon Suppression Hall, but he didn’t hear Grim Demon’s voice again.</p>
<p>What’s so different about Demonic Neonate? It actually made Grim Demon so reverent to the point of even being willing to sign a master-slave contract? Zhou Wen couldn’t guess.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he had the mysterious phone. He planned on bringing Demonic Neonate here in-game to see the black cocoon’s reaction.</p>
<p>Outside Jade Emperor Peak, Zhou Wen launched the Demon Suppression Mountain instance dungeon and led Demonic Neonate into the Demon Suppression Hall before arriving in front of the black cocoon.</p>
<p>The black cocoon in-game wasn’t as intelligent as the Grim Demon in real life. No one spoke. Zhou Wen attempted to get Demonic Neonate to approach the black cocoon.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate held the ancient sword and slowly walked to the black cocoon. She extended a tiny hand and pressed it on the black cocoon.</p>
<p>The demonic aura in the black cocoon immediately erupted and sent Demonic Neonate flying. Thankfully, Demonic Neonate seemed to have a high resistance to the demonic aura and wasn’t injured.</p>
<p>That’s strange. Demonic Neonate’s strength isn’t enough to fight Grim Demon. It can’t even withstand the demonic aura he emits. Why does Grim Demon think so highly of her? He even said that he’s afraid of her? Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out the crux of the problem.</p>
<p>However, Demonic Neonate was somewhat odd. After coming into contact with the black cocoon and the demonic aura, she began to take the initiative to attack the black cocoon. She even opened her mouth as though she wanted to bite the black cocoon.</p>
<p>Although the demonic aura forced her back time and time again, the powerful demonic aura could not harm Demonic Neonate’s body. However, Demonic Neonate’s strength was still too weak, so she failed to break through the demonic aura’s defenses.</p>
<p>There’s indeed a problem. Zhou Wen held back Demonic Neonate and summoned her in reality. He stared into her eyes and asked, “Why do you want to attack the black cocoon?”</p>
<p>“Eat,” Demonic Neonate answered simply. She didn’t know many words. Zhou Wen had tried to teach her how to speak for a long period of time, but she still didn’t really speak.</p>
<p>It was already very rare for her to say a word.</p>
<p>“You want to eat that black cocoon?” Zhou Wen confirmed again.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate didn’t say anything this time and only nodded.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood why Grim Demon restrained his demonic aura after Demonic Neonate appeared. He didn’t dare move because he was afraid of attracting Demonic Neonate’s attention.</p>
<p>“What benefits do you get from eating the black cocoon?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate shook her head with a blank expression. Clearly, this was only her instinct. Even she herself didn’t know why she wanted to eat the black cocoon, or rather, what use Grim Demon had.</p>
<p>“Do you know what a contract means?” Zhou Wen asked her again.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate nodded slightly. From the looks of it, she knew what the contract was about.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression changed constantly. There was indeed a chance in front of him, but he didn’t know what would happen if a Companion Beast had a Guardian.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, Demonic Neonate is my Companion Beast. If Grim Demon is her slave guardian, it should be easy to control him, right?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen asked Demonic Neonate again, “If I let you sign a master-slave contract with the creature inside the black cocoon, will it harm you?”</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate thought for a moment before shaking her head.</p>
<p>“If the contract’s initiative is in your hands, you can consider signing a master-slave contract with the guardian inside the black cocoon. In that case, won’t his life be in your hands? If you want to eat him, you should be able to do so at any time, right? Just treat it as a food reserve, alright?” Zhou Wen only suggested, unsure if this method was feasible.</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, Demonic Neonate lowered her head as though she was deep in thought. After a while, she nodded and said, “Okay… Contract… Food reserve…”</p>
<p>Although Demonic Neonate didn’t speak clearly, Zhou Wen still understood the meaning behind her words. In his delight, he led Demonic Neonate into the Demon Suppression Hall once again.</p>
<p>As he walked, Zhou Wen persuaded, “Don’t be in a rush to eat him after signing the contract. There are still many fruits here. Just treat that as a food reserve. Eat him when the fruits are finished.”</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate thought seriously for a moment before nodding. “Food reserve… No eating…”</p>
<p>“Very good. How smart.” Zhou Wen patted Demonic Neonate’s head and praised her.</p>
<p>Soon, the two of them arrived at the spot where Grim Demon was suppressed. Zhou Wen went up and said to Grim Demon, “Grim Demon, it took me a long time to persuade her before she finally agreed to contract with you, but it has to be a master-slave contract.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” Grim Demon answered quickly. From his tone, it was as though Zhou Wen was spouting nonsense. It was only natural for him to sign a master-slave contract with Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to tell Demonic Neonate how to use the master-slave contract and to warn her to be careful when contracting. If she felt something amiss, she should immediately stop the contractual process.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, Demonic Neonate seemed to be more familiar with the contract than him. She walked straight to the black cocoon and pressed one hand on it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter604'>Chapter 604 Food Reserve</h3>
<p>The black cocoon automatically cracked, revealing a ghastly face formed from black smoke. Demonic Neonate pressed her tiny hand on the face.The entire process felt like a guardian contract reversed. When the contractual process was completed, the black cocoon shattered. The seven white jade hoops that bound the black cocoon fell to the ground with tinkling sounds.</p>
<p>Grim Demon escaped and was like a devil formed from black gas that swept towards Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate glared at him, and Grim Demon immediately stopped in midair, not daring to approach her.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate held the ancient sword in her arms. As though unwilling, Grim Demon eventually flew towards the ancient sword and transformed into wisps of black gas that fused into it.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the black gas formed by Grim Demon completely fused with the ancient sword, causing the ancient sword to undergo some strange changes. The original purple color became darker. At a glance, one would think it was black, but it was actually a dark-purple color.</p>
<p>There were even more runes on the scabbard, making it look even more mysterious and strange than before.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched, dumbfounded. He had never seen a Guardian acting so lowly and submissive. Not only had he signed a master-slave contract, but he didn’t even dare possess her. All he could do was attach himself to the ancient sword.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate carried the ancient sword and returned to Zhou Wen’s side. “Food reserve… acquired.”</p>
<p>“Alright, save it for now.” Zhou Wen calmed down Demonic Neonate before entering the game to take a look. Indeed, the black cocoon in-game was gone. From the looks of it, all the Guardians had a uniqueness.</p>
<p>The seven white jade hoops on the ground were of unknown use, but Zhou Wen stored them in his chaos space.</p>
<p>After leaving White Cloud Mountain, Zhou Wen rode on a Chi and headed for school while grinding the game dungeons.</p>
<p>It happened to be Golden Battle God Halberd’s respawning time, so Zhou Wen wanted to give it a try. After Demonic Neonate had Grim Demon as a Guardian, how much had her strength increased?</p>
<p>A Guardian’s strength was a mystery to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Some of the guardians were very strong, just like the one in Ant City and a Guardian like Fairy Burial. They were very powerful.</p>
<p>However, the six-winged seraphim he had encountered previously seemed very weak on John.</p>
<p>Yet, after the six-winged seraphim left John, he seemed to become much stronger.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen guessed that after the guardians fused with humans, the amount of strength they could produce depended on how strong the human was.</p>
<p>He entered the Metalwork Temple where the Golden Battle God Halberd had just respawned. When it saw Zhou Wen and Demonic Neonate, the tip of the trident immediately lit up.</p>
<p>If it was in the past, Demonic Neonate wouldn’t have dared to face the trident’s golden divine light due to her low level. She would have hidden in the dark and released her sword to deal sneak attacks.</p>
<p>However, this time, the ancient sword in Demonic Neonate’s arms broke out of its scabbard. Its surging black-purple demonic aura blocked the golden beam.</p>
<p>The ancient sword’s body appeared above the Golden Battle God Halberd as if it had teleported, slicing the Golden Battle God Halberd into two.</p>
<p>Although Demonic Neonate’s strength hadn’t increased, her Demonic Sword was much stronger than before. It was able to slice through the Golden Battle God Halberd in one strike. Furthermore, she had won cleanly without any scruples.</p>
<p>Not bad… Not bad… Zhou Wen was delighted. The Demonic Sword’s offensive power had greatly increased, and it also had demonic aura effects. It made it much easier for him to kill Mythical creatures in the future.</p>
<p>After the fusion of the Demonic Sword and Guardian, I still have to slowly study how strong it is. Zhou Wen was in a good mood as he rushed back to school.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was in a good mood, Grim Demon was not in a good mood. He originally imagined that Demonic Neonate would sincerely sign a contract with him. He found it acceptable being a slave Guardian.</p>
<p>However, after hearing Zhou Wen and Demonic Neonate’s conversation, Grim Demon’s heart turned cold. How was he a slave? They were treating him as food reserves. Who knew when Demonic Neonate would eat him if she wasn’t happy?</p>
<p>Grim Demon hated Zhou Wen to the core because he knew that Demonic Neonate definitely wouldn’t have such complicated thoughts. It had to be Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, there was nothing he could do. All he could do was try his best to showcase himself and please Demonic Neonate. He hoped that he could obtain Demonic Neonate’s approval so that she wouldn’t eat him up for the sake of it.</p>
<p>And what made Grim Demon feel uneasy was that he often found himself appearing in strange dimensional zones. He had no idea how he had entered them.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was the fact that after he died in battle once, he imagined he was doomed. However, before long his consciousness returned to normal, it was as though the death had never happened.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Grim Demon was alarmed and afraid. He was constantly on tenterhooks.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen experimented several times and realized that the Grim Demon’s ability wasn’t as powerful as he had claimed. However, it also allowed the Demonic Sword to reach the level of a top-notch Mythical.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen didn’t know that the ancient sword possessed by Grim Demon wasn’t strong itself and was only a supplementary tool. As the level of its master, Demonic Neonate, was too low, it limited Grim Demon’s abilities. Grim Demon’s strength wasn’t just limited to this. The result was purely because he was restricted.</p>
<p>After returning to the city, Zhou Wen heard everyone discussing the ranking war.</p>
<p>Most people were discussing which Companion Beast was stronger and which one was weaker. They talked about the rising of Companion Beast rankings yesterday and which Companion Beast was defeated.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had never heard of many of the Companion Beasts they discussed.</p>
<p>However, the one which was discussed the most was Primordial Sword Immortal. Zhou Wen quickly learned that Primordial Sword Immortal remained at the top of the rankings. After several challenges, none of the Companion Beasts could shake its dominance.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also had the intention to vie for first place. He wanted to get a divine fruit and feed it to his Companion Beast, but he wasn’t in a rush. There were still three months before the deadline. Zhou Wen still wanted to wait a little longer to see if there were any truly powerful Mythical Companion Beasts that could challenge Primordial Sword Immortal. He wanted to understand Primordial Sword Immortal’s abilities before deciding which Companion Beast to send to fight for first place.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen returned to school, he realized that it was especially lively. It was actually a farewell party. Another class of students had graduated.</p>
<p>Time really flies. Unknowingly, I’ve already been at Sunset College for a year. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but sigh.</p>
<p>These days, schools didn’t have the long winter and summer vacations like in the past. Vacations were at most around ten days. New students would matriculate, and Zhou Wen and company would be promoted to second years.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, I didn’t think I would be able to see you before I leave. I never expected you to rush back in time,” Wei Ge walked over and said to Zhou Wen with a smile.</p>
<p>“Senior, aren’t you staying on campus?” Zhou Wen asked Wei Ge in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Wei Ge smiled and said, “The school wants me to stay, but I rejected it. Before I leave, I have a wish. I wonder if you can help me fulfill it?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter605'>Chapter 605 Hypocritical Facade</h3>
<p>“What wish? If it’s not too difficult, I can give it a try,” Zhou Wen said.“It’s nothing difficult. I just want you to help me guess a riddle. Come on.” Wei Ge turned around and led the way.“Do we still need to go to a special place for guessing riddles?” Zhou Wen asked as he followed behind.</p>
<p>“It took me my entire life to think of such a riddle, so show it some respect. Let’s find a place with the correct atmosphere. It will appear a little ritualistic,” Wei Ge said with a smile.</p>
<p>The two of them arrived at the school’s old campus. Today was convocation. Sunset College didn’t have a commencement ceremony, but there was a convocation ceremony. Students were basically attending the convocation ceremony, leaving the old campus empty.</p>
<p>When they arrived at an empty land, Wei Ge stopped and turned to look at Zhou Wen. “Alright, let’s do it here.”</p>
<p>“What’s your riddle?” Zhou Wen stared at Wei Ge and asked. He naturally understood that Wei Ge’s so-called riddle wasn’t a brain teaser.</p>
<p>“My riddle is actually very simple. Guess which one is real? Which one is fake?” As Wei Ge spoke, he raised his right hand and held a coin between his middle finger and index finger. With a flick, the coin flew towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The coin’s speed was like a meteor, but it wasn’t surprising. Such speed still seemed too slow to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, halfway through, the coin split into two, turning into two coins that flew to Zhou Wen’s sides.</p>
<p>The two coins looked identical. It was impossible to tell which one was real and which one was fake. Even the ripples of air being ripped apart were identical.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood still and allowed the two coins to fly past him. This was because he couldn’t tell which coin was real. There was no point in swatting them down.</p>
<p>After the two coins flew past him, they landed on the ground not far away. The coin on the left disappeared, leaving only the coin on the right.</p>
<p>“Senior, you condensed a Life Soul and advanced to the Epic stage?” Zhou Wen looked at Wei Ge in surprise.</p>
<p>Wei Ge nodded and said, “My Life Soul is called Hypocritical Facade. You saw its ability just now, so please help me distinguish which one is the real me. Can you help me tear off that facade?”</p>
<p>With that said, Wei Ge’s figure suddenly moved. He was clearly a single person, but the moment he moved, he split into two and attacked Zhou Wen from both sides.</p>
<p>The speed and strength of the two figures felt very real. It was impossible to tell which was Wei Ge’s real body and which was an illusion.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen moved his feet and dodged Wei Ge’s attack like a ghost. This was because he couldn’t tell which one was the real Wei Ge.</p>
<p>However, this time, the two Wei Ges didn’t vanish. Instead, they split into four. The two Wei Ges transformed into four Wei Ges and attacked Zhou Wen from different directions.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen dodged again. In the next strike, Wei Ge’s figure split into eight and attacked Zhou Wen from all directions, sealing off all his escape routes.</p>
<p>If it were anyone else, they would have no choice but to make a choice. However, Zhou Wen’s movement technique was just amazing, allowing him to pass through the eight Wei Ges.</p>
<p>“As expected of Zhou Wen. Receive my final strike.” Wei Ge’s eyes burned. When the eight figures spoke, they emitted sound waves that made it impossible to tell where the real Wei Ge was.</p>
<p>In the next instant, the eight figures split apart again, transforming into sixteen figures that attacked Zhou Wen again. They sealed off every inch of space, preventing him from dodging.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen didn’t move because he had nowhere to go. Even with his movement technique, it was impossible for him to rush out of this blockade. It was time to make a decision.</p>
<p>Without looking at the sixteen Wei Ges, Zhou Wen closed his eyes and stood rooted to the ground.</p>
<p>The first figure’s fist struck Zhou Wen, but he didn’t move. The figure vanished without a trace. It was only an illusion. It happened a second, a third, and a fourth time. One figure after another struck Zhou Wen in different poses before disappearing one after another.</p>
<p>The fifteen figures vanished. When the last figure charged at Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen finally opened his eyes and moved. However, he didn’t look at the figure charging at him. Instead, he turned around.</p>
<p>The last figure slammed into Zhou Wen’s back before disappearing.</p>
<p>However, another Wei Ge appeared opposite Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“How did you discover me?” Wei Ge asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I didn’t discover you. Your illusion is real. I can’t tell if it’s real or fake,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Then how did you know that the sixteen phantoms weren’t me?” Wei Ge frowned slightly. If Zhou Wen couldn’t tell the authenticity of the phantoms, how did he know that the sixteen phantoms weren’t his real body?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen smiled and said, “Because I believe in your character.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Wei Ge was slightly taken aback as he asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Because you are a person who likes to play chess. How can a person who likes to play chess treat themselves as a chess piece?” Zhou Wen said seriously.</p>
<p>Wei Ge looked at Zhou Wen in a daze. After a while, he laughed and leaned back, his tears almost flowing out.</p>
<p>“So that’s how it is. Life is like a game of chess. What right do I, Wei Ge, have to think that I can transcend a game? I’d forgotten. If I can’t enter the game, what right do I have to influence it?” Wei Ge wiped away his smile and looked at Zhou Wen solemnly. “I’m leaving. I’m going to the capital and starting from the smallest chess piece. If there’s a day when I can change the development of the game, I hope I have the chance to ask you again to guess my riddle.”</p>
<p>“Are you really not staying?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Wei Ge didn’t answer. He turned around and left. As he walked, he said, “It’s a pleasure to play chess with other humans, but it will be a bitter battle playing chess with the heavens. In my lifetime, if I am lucky to barely defeat the heavens, it will be enough for me.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood there motionless as he watched Wei Ge leave.</p>
<p>As a chess piece, one can’t even control their fate. Can one really break out of this situation? Zhou Wen didn’t know the answer as he couldn’t help but feel vexed.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan, Zhong Ziya, Hui Haifeng, Wang Lu, Zhang Yuzhi, and Wei Ge were all outstanding people of the present era, but they had no choice but to head to a future they didn’t know of under the influence of fate.</p>
<p>Sunset College’s convocation ceremony was more like a farewell before a warrior went to the battlefield. After leaving the school gates, the students would face the battlefield of life which had no regularity. No one could protect them. Their life and death were in their hands.</p>
<p>606 Freshmen Matriculation</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen returned to his dorm, he saw that there were many boxes in the living room. They were likely to be the things Li Xuan had sent over. Apart from him, only Li Xuan and An Sheng had the key to his place. An Sheng probably didn’t have the time to come over.</p>
<p>Bam! Bam!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had just entered when he suddenly felt two heavy blows on the back of his head. He fell to the ground as his vision turned black.</p>
<p>Alarmed, he didn’t know who could sneak an attack on him without him noticing.</p>
<p>He forced himself to charge forward and make a counterattack.</p>
<p>However, when he turned around, he realized that it was the antelope standing behind him, looking at him angrily. The chick was standing on the door frame, looking at him unhappily.</p>
<p>Oh no… In the past, because Wang Lu was around, I didn’t need to pay attention to the two of them when I was out. They would run to Wang Lu by themselves. Now that she’s gone, they have nowhere to go! How could I have forgotten about this… Zhou Wen shivered when he saw the angry expressions on the antelope and chick. He hurriedly said with a smile, “Don’t be angry. I went out this time to especially gather delicacies for you. This is something I found for you…”</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen spoke, he searched his body, but he obviously hadn’t prepared anything for the antelope and chick. He failed to find anything despite searching all day.</p>
<p>With an idea in mind, Zhou Wen took out the beef jerky he had prepared from the Chaos Bead. This was part of his food reserves. Zhou Wen planned on eating them when he was trapped in certain places. They were all high-quality goods that were rather expensive. Now, he had no choice but to take them out.</p>
<p>Seeing the antelope and chick eat the bag of dried meat, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but feel his heart ache. He didn’t have many savings left.</p>
<p>Although he had plenty of Essence Crystals, they hadn’t been exchanged for money. Zhou Wen was still a pauper and the remaining money had been used to buy items for The Thearch.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen opened the boxes and carefully checked them. Indeed, it was the items he had asked Li Xuan to buy. The quantity was right.</p>
<p>He called Li Xuan and told him that he had returned and had received the items.</p>
<p>The two chatted for a while before Zhou Wen realized that the antelope and chick hadn’t starved during his absence. An Sheng had been delivering food to them.</p>
<p>Damned antelope. Since you aren’t hungry, why did you hit me? Zhou Wen glared at the antelope, but he didn’t dare say it out loud.</p>
<p>In the past, he had believed that the antelope was an Epic creature, but he was already considered one of the best at the Epic stage. The fact that the antelope could still secretly hoove him twice meant that this fellow definitely wasn’t as simple as an Epic creature.</p>
<p>This fellow is definitely at the Mythical stage, and it’s not any ordinary Mythical stage creature. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to have such high intelligence. What motives does he have for following me? Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>When the antelope followed him, he was still weak. He really couldn’t figure out what it liked about him.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The battles on the Companion Beast rankings continued, but most of them were Mythical pets that challenged each other on the rankings. The rankings just shifted and there were very few new Companion Beasts on the list.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen grinded dungeons, he studied his Life Soul and the First Order of Chaos. He lived a very fulfilling life.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, it was time for the freshmen to matriculate. Li Xuan pulled Zhou Wen and company along and set up a stall with the other clubs to recruit new members.</p>
<p>However, the other clubs’ recruitment stands were surrounded by many freshmen, but Zhou Wen and company didn’t even have a single student patronizing their stall. Even when students passed by, they quickly sped up after taking a look.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, and Gu Dian sat in a row behind a table. Li Xuan leaned lazily against the chair and dug his nose. Zhou Wen lowered his head as he gamed. Gu Dian wore a serious expression as he sat there, waiting for the freshmen to make inquiries. However, with his forbidding looks, the freshmen were afraid of him. They didn’t dare come over and fled in fright when Gu Dian took a glance at them.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen and company’s bleakness formed a stark contrast with the popular clubs around them. It was as though they were a vacuum.</p>
<p>“I hereby announce that from today onwards, I, Gulli, will be the king of Sunset College. If you aren’t convinced, step forward.” A clear voice came from the school’s entrance, causing the noisy school gates to fall silent.</p>
<p>The freshmen looked in the direction of the school’s entrance and saw a handsome, tall, brown-haired youth standing on the steps of a memorial wall. He looked like the king of the world as he raised his head and loudly announced that the world belonged to him.</p>
<p>However, very quickly, most of the people’s attention was attracted to a girl beside him.</p>
<p>The girl was wearing a white dress. She was tall, but her face was exquisite like an angel’s. She had long blond hair and green eyes. She looked like she had walked out of an oil painting.</p>
<p>“What excellence. I never expected our school to have such an excellent junior. If we can woo her, I’m afraid others will die of envy,” Li Xuan said as he looked at the girl.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was only joking, but many people had already taken action. The freshmen were still very reserved, but the seniors had already mastered the ability to be shameless. This was especially so for the old foxes of the clubs. All of them held their club’s recruitment notices and ran over to the girl, inviting her to join their club. They also asked for the girl’s name and so on. If it wasn’t to maintain their images as seniors, they would have even asked for her vital statistics.</p>
<p>Gulli was originally very satisfied that he had attracted the attention of all the students, but he soon realized that no one was paying any attention to him. Everyone was surrounding the girl, causing the corners of his eyes to twitch. His aura seemed to have become very strange.</p>
<p>This was Sunset College. The older students were already accustomed to it, so how could they care about a freshman like Gulli? They thought nothing of him.</p>
<p>“Get out of the way. We aren’t joining any clubs.” Gulli had no choice but to jump down the stairs and part the crowd around the girl, pushing away the enthusiastic seniors.</p>
<p>The girl’s attitude was friendly, but it was obvious that her thoughts weren’t on those people. She scanned the crowd and when she saw Zhou Wen, she immediately stared at him as though she had found her prey.</p>
<p>“He’s there,” the girl said to Gulli.</p>
<p>Gulli traced the girl’s gaze and saw Zhou Wen. He opened up a path from the crowd of seniors and walked towards Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>The girl followed behind Gulli and also walked towards Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>Some of the seniors had originally planned on pestering them, but when they saw them walk towards Zhou Wen and company, they could only stop and watch from afar in dismay. </p>
<h3 id='chapter607'>Chapter 607 Little Brother Who Came For Zhou Wen</h3>
<p>Gulli walked to the table and took out his phone. Then, he opened the photo album and found a photo. He looked at it before looking at Zhou Wen. After confirming it, he put away his phone and said to Zhou Wen, “You are the strongest student at Sunset College, Zhou Wen, right? I, Gulli, want to challenge you. Let’s go to the training grounds.”Li Xuan looked at Gulli with interest, but he didn’t say a word.Zhou Wen put down his phone and sized up Gulli. “You’ve got the wrong person.”</p>
<p>“The wrong person?” Gulli was taken aback when he heard that. He hurriedly took out his phone and quickly tapped on the photo to compare it with Zhou Wen before saying to Zhou Wen, “Don’t try to lie to me. The person in the photo is clearly you.”</p>
<p>With that said, Gulli rotated his phone to let Zhou Wen take a look at the photo.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at the photo. It really was him, but it didn’t look like the photo he had taken recently. The clothes were probably the ones he wore when he went to the Holy Land.</p>
<p>“You really have got the wrong person. Take a closer look. The person in the photo has longer hair than me. Furthermore, his pupils are pure black. My pupils are a little brownish-black. Take a closer look. Our facial features are somewhat different,” Zhou Wen said to Gulli.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, Gulli took a closer look and felt that it was indeed a little different.</p>
<p>In fact, everyone’s photos were slightly different from the person. This was normal.</p>
<p>“Sis, it looks like we got the wrong person,” Gulli said to the beautiful girl.</p>
<p>The girl rolled her eyes at him and said to Zhou Wen, “To be able to defeat a genius like Lance, I thought Zhou Wen was really an impressive figure. But he’s just a coward who doesn’t even dare recognize his name.”</p>
<p>“You know Lance?” Zhou Wen asked the girl.</p>
<p>“My name is Sadie. This is my younger brother, Gulli. Lance is our cousin,” the girl said.</p>
<p>“So it’s Lance’s cousins. Welcome to Sunset College to study. If there’s anything you aren’t used to, feel free to look for me. I’ll try my best to help you within my capabilities.” Although Zhou Wen and Lance were rivals before, Zhou Wen was still very impressed with Lance’s character.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Lance had once helped them leave Holy City. It was only right for him to take care of his cousins.</p>
<p>“Are you really Zhou Wen? Why did you lie?” Gulli stared at Zhou Wen angrily.</p>
<p>Li Xuan said with a smile, “He’s Zhou Wen, but his name isn’t the strongest student at Sunset College, Zhou Wen. Therefore, he’s not lying.”</p>
<p>“Humph, cut the crap. I want to defeat you and avenge Lance,” Gulli said as he stared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Even Lance lost. Do you think you are stronger than Lance?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“Lance is naturally the strongest. Zhou Wen was only lucky to defeat him. If you battle again, Lance will definitely win. I will definitely win as well,” Gulli said confidently.</p>
<p>“I see. Seeing how confident you are, I believe you can defeat Zhou Wen. However, Sunset College forbids private duels. Even if you don’t care about being expelled, Zhou Wen won’t fight you,” Li Xuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>Gulli immediately frowned. “Why would Sunset College have such a rule? Wouldn’t that mean our special admission into Sunset College was a waste of time?”</p>
<p>“That’s not the case. Seeing how confident you are, your abilities definitely can’t be bad. I also believe that you can definitely defeat Zhou Wen. To be honest, I’ve long found Zhou Wen an eyesore. Unfortunately, I’m no match for him, so I might as well help you. See this? You and your sister can fill in this application form and sign it. Then, you can join our Xuanwen Club. The Xuanwen Club is a formal club approved by the school. The club’s members are free to spar. You can use the opportunity to defeat Zhou Wen. This way, Zhou Wen and you won’t be punished. He has no way of rejecting the sparring either.”</p>
<p>With that said, Li Xuan stuffed the two application forms into Gulli’s hand. He patted his shoulder and said, “Junior, this is all I can do for you. Whether or not you can help Lance avenge his humiliation depends on you.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure I can challenge Zhou Wen this way?” Gulli asked Li Xuan in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Of course. After joining the club, you’ll definitely be able to spar with Zhou Wen. If not, I’ll stand there and let you beat me until you are satisfied,” Li Xuan said as he patted his chest.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll be joining.” Gulli leaned against the table and began filling in the form.</p>
<p>“Junior Sadie, you also wish to challenge Zhou Wen, right? Fill it out together.” Li Xuan handed the other application form to Sadie.</p>
<p>Sadie glanced at Li Xuan as though she had seen through him. However, Li Xuan didn’t mind as he continued smiling at her.</p>
<p>Sadie didn’t say anything. She picked up the pen on the table and filled in the application form before signing her name.</p>
<p>“Congratulations to the two of you for becoming new members of our Xuanwen Club.” After receiving their application forms, he extended his hand out to Sadie.</p>
<p>However, Sadie ignored him and looked at Zhou Wen. “Can we challenge you now?”</p>
<p>“Of course, but you can’t do it here, right? Go to your dorms and settle down first. I’ll arrange the time and venue for you. Don’t worry. With me around, I guarantee that you will have plenty of time to spar with Zhou Wen…” Li Xuan warmly helped Sadie take her luggage and took them to the matriculation booth.</p>
<p>When members from the other clubs saw that Sadie had been pulled into the Xuanwen Club, they secretly pounded their chests and stamped their feet. Their hearts ached for such a beautiful woman. She had actually entered a beast’s nest.</p>
<p>Once Li Xuan left, there was no need for Zhou Wen and Gu Dian to stay. They couldn’t recruit new members at all.</p>
<p>With Li Xuan handling them, Zhou Wen didn’t pay any attention to this matter. He returned to continue grinding his game dungeons.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The next morning, after Gulli and Sadie finished their matriculation procedures, they contacted Li Xuan to arrange the duel with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Li Xuan agreed and got Gulli and Shady to wait for him at the training grounds.</p>
<p>Gulli and Sadie arrived at the training grounds. After waiting for a while, they saw Li Xuan bring a boy over. He looked handsome, but he wasn’t Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan, where’s Zhou Wen?” Gulli asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“Calm down. Let me introduce him to you. This student’s surname is Feng. He is under the tutelage of Zhou Wen and has learned a few saber techniques. I especially invited him over to let you take a look at his saber techniques so that you will have a basic understanding of Zhou Wen. This way, when you challenge him again, your chances of winning will be much higher,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. Our strength is enough to defeat Zhou Wen. We don’t have to waste time on this,” Gulli rejected.</p>
<p>“It’s not a big deal taking a look first. I’ve long found Zhou Wen an eyesore. I sincerely hope that you can beat him. Don’t you disappoint me,” Li Xuan said as he waved at Feng Qiuyan. “Little Yanyan, spar with Junior Gulli. Use everything you learned from Zhou Wen. Don’t disappoint him.”</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan walked silently to the training grounds’ arena. Gulli felt that Li Xuan had good intentions and couldn’t reject him. Seeing Sadie nod, he walked into the arena.</p>
<h3 id='chapter608'>Chapter 608 Stalking</h3>
<p>“I’ll give you a one-hand handicap. Come.” Gulli didn’t pick a weapon from the training rack. He extended his hand and hooked his hand at Feng Qiuyan, gesturing for him to attack.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan didn’t stand on ceremony. He picked up a practice saber from the rack, walked to Gulli, and slashed.</p>
<p>Gulli and Lance came from the same family. Among his peers, he was only impressed with Lance. He couldn’t accept the fact that Lance had been defeated by Zhou Wen. He and Sadie shared the same thoughts. They had entered Sunset College together to right Lance’s reputation.</p>
<p>Gulli’s strength was not bad. He wasn’t much weaker than Lance from a year ago. He naturally didn’t take the unknown Feng Qiuyan seriously.</p>
<p>However, when Feng Qiuyan’s saber was unsheathed, his aura instantly exploded as though he had changed into a different person. Gulli’s expression changed drastically as his body tensed up. He quickly moved, hoping to dodge Feng Qiuyan’s saber.</p>
<p>However, just as Gulli raised his toes, Feng Qiuyan’s practice saber was already at his neck. Gulli’s expression turned extremely ugly.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Now Gulli didn’t believe that Feng Qiuyan was some nobody who had randomly learned a few saber techniques from Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I’m Feng Qiuyan. I learned a few mediocre saber techniques from Coach Zhou Wen. I look forward to our fight,” Feng Qiuyan said as he retracted his saber.</p>
<p>Gulli’s gaze focused as he suddenly attacked to catch Feng Qiuyan by surprise.</p>
<p>However, just as he raised his fist, Feng Qiuyan’s saber was pressed against his neck again. It was so fast that he couldn’t see the saber’s shadow.</p>
<p>Gulli refused to accept it as he pushed away the practice saber and attacked again. However, Feng Qiuyan moved slightly and dodged his fist. At the same time, the practice saber was placed on his neck.</p>
<p>Gulli was alarmed and furious. Feng Qiuyan was about the same age as him, but his saber techniques were so fast that he couldn’t even dodge them. If it was a true life-and-death battle, he wouldn’t have enough limbs for him to cleave off even if he had three heads and six arms.</p>
<p>“Gulli, that’s enough.” Sadie stopped Gulli from continuing the battle. She could tell that Gulli was obviously inferior to Feng Qiuyan. It would be impossible for him to win.</p>
<p>“Your surname is Feng. Are you from the capital’s Feng family or the Sea Return’s Feng family?” Gulli retreated to the side as Sadie asked Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>“The Sea Return’s Feng family,” Feng Qiuyan answered.</p>
<p>“With the Sea Return Feng family producing a saber genius like you, there’s hope for it to take back the Divine Wind Blade and become the main Feng family,” said Sadie.</p>
<p>“You’re too kind. My saber techniques aren’t much. I just learned a little from Coach,” Feng Qiuyan said indifferently when he saw that Sadie had no intention of attacking. He placed the practice saber back on the rack.</p>
<p>“Did you really learn your saber techniques from Zhou Wen?” Sadie didn’t believe Feng Qiuyan’s words.</p>
<p>He and Gulli had watched the video of Zhou Wen and Lance’s battle. Zhou Wen would probably not have been a match for Feng Qiuyan back then.</p>
<p>In less than a year, no matter how fast Zhou Wen improved, it was impossible for him to be stronger than Feng Qiuyan. How could he teach Feng Qiuyan such saber techniques?</p>
<p>“Yes,” Feng Qiuyan answered before saying to Li Xuan, “President, I’ll be heading back now. I’ve got an appointment with Coach to do a homework mission together.”</p>
<p>“Little Yanyan, go back now.” Li Xuan sent Feng Qiuyan away with a smile before sighing at Gulli and Sadie. “You can’t even defeat Feng Qiuyan, so how are you going to challenge Zhou Wen? From the looks of it, I can only let that fellow continue his arrogant ways. It’s really heart-wrenching!”</p>
<p>Gulli was momentarily disappointed. Feng Qiuyan’s absolute suppression had already made him lose his confidence.</p>
<p>“However, you don’t have to be too disheartened. Our club still has many activities. When the time comes, you will still have the chance to continue learning and growing. Zhou Wen will often participate in activities. Work hard, and there’s still a chance of defeating him. I think highly of you.” As Li Xuan spoke, he picked up his phone and looked at it. “Alright, that’s all for today. I’ll inform you when the club has an activity.”</p>
<p>“Sis, it’s no wonder Zhou Wen defeated Lance. The disciples he taught are so strong. He must be stronger,” Gulli said in disappointment.</p>
<p>However, Sadie curled her lips and said, “Gulli, you are too gullible. It’s too easy for you to be deceived. Feng Qiuyan’s saber technique already has the inklings of a master saber expert. Even among the six families, there aren’t many people with such saber techniques. How can Zhou Wen teach such a person? It’s more like him teaching Zhou Wen.”</p>
<p>“But Feng Qiuyan said it himself…” Before Gulli could finish, Sadie interrupted him.</p>
<p>Sadie said firmly, “The more that’s the case, the more problematic it is. If Zhou Wen is really that strong, why didn’t he accept the challenge himself? It’s clearly because he’s afraid of losing to us that he joined forces with Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan to put up such a show for us. It’s to make us give up on challenging him.”</p>
<p>“I see. I was almost fooled by him. Let’s go find Zhou Wen. We can’t let him run again no matter what.” Gulli’s eyes gradually lit up.</p>
<p>However, when he turned his head, Gulli frowned again. “But how can we find Zhou Wen? We have no idea where he lives.”</p>
<p>“That’s not difficult. Didn’t Feng Qiuyan say that he has an appointment with Zhou Wen? As long as we follow Feng Qiuyan, we will definitely be able to find him,” Sadie said indifferently.</p>
<p>“That’s right. With your Eye of Odin, it’ll be easy to keep up with Feng Qiuyan. Let’s go now,” Gulli said as he walked out.</p>
<p>The two of them left the training grounds. Sadie’s eyes suffused a faint blue light as she led the way. Soon, the two of them arrived at Dragon Gate Grotto. From afar, they saw Zhou Wen and Feng Qiuyan enter a cave together.</p>
<p>“I see them. They are there. Zhou Wen is indeed here,” Gulli said as he pointed to where Zhou Wen and Feng Qiuyan had entered.</p>
<p>Sadie nodded and the two of them arrived in front of the cave. She carefully sized up the cave and said, “This should be the Lotus Flower Cave in Dragon Gate Grotto. There are Legendary Flying Beasts and Epic Fairy-type dimensional creatures inside. With Feng Qiuyan’s strength, the Flying Beasts aren’t challenging him. I reckon they are here to kill the Fairies.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter what they kill. They just happened to enter a dimensional zone. Let’s chase after them and fight Zhou Wen. As long as we defeat him, it doesn’t matter even if we get expelled. After all, we came here to defeat him,” said Gulli as he quickly walked towards Lotus Flower Cave. Sadie followed closely behind.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been invited by Feng Qiuyan to Lotus Flower Cave. As Feng Qiuyan had discovered a Mutated Fairy there, he had invited Zhou Wen to kill it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter609'>Chapter 609 Slaying Fairies</h3>
<p>The last time Zhou Wen came to kill the Mutated Fairy, he was with Jiang Yan, Zhong Ziya, and Hui Haifeng. Now, the three of them were scattered across the world. He did not know if there would come a day when the four of them would reunite.“The Mutated Fairy is inside. I’ll be in charge of restraining the Flying Beasts and ordinary Fairies later. I’ll leave the Mutated Fairy to you, Coach,” Feng Qiuyan said.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.</p>
<p>The two of them walked into one of the caves. Sadie and Gulli also arrived nearby. When they saw Zhou Wen and Feng Qiuyan walk into the cave, Gulli wanted to chase after them, but he was stopped by Sadie.</p>
<p>“Wait a moment.” After grabbing Gulli, Sadie looked in the direction of the cave that Zhou Wen had entered. An eye suddenly flew out of her eye socket and vanished as though it had teleported.</p>
<p>Sadie had one eye closed, but her other opened eye shot out a light beam that formed a three-dimensional projection in front of her. It was a scene of Zhou Wen and Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>In the projection, they were facing a group of Flying Beasts. There were at least a few hundred of them. There were also more than a dozen of Fairies, as well as a mutated black-and-white Fairy.</p>
<p>“So many Fairies. Can the two of them deal with so many Fairies?” Gulli asked while looking at the three-dimensional projection.</p>
<p>“Coach, I’ll pave the way for you,” Feng Qiuyan said as he drew his saber to meet the incoming Flying Beasts.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. Didn’t you invite me over to see me take action? Leave it to me.” Zhou Wen knew very well.</p>
<p>If Feng Qiuyan really wanted him to kill the Mutated Fairy, he would definitely try his best. It was impossible for him to seek his help. The reason he had invited him wasn’t to kill the Mutated Fairy at all.</p>
<p>“As expected, nothing can escape your eyes, Coach,” Feng Qiuyan said.</p>
<p>“Then just watch.” Zhou Wen held the Bamboo Blade in hand as he stared at the Flying Beasts and Fairies that rushed over like a swath of dark clouds. However, his focus wasn’t on them. Instead, he passed through the beast horde and stared at the Mutated Fairy floating in the sky.</p>
<p>“What is he trying to do? To fight so many dimensional creatures alone, even an Epic wouldn’t be able to escape unscathed, right?” Gulli said.</p>
<p>“Wait until everything is over,” said Sadie.</p>
<p>Seeing the horde of Flying Beasts and Fairies rush towards Zhou Wen and about to lunge at him, Feng Qiuyan, who was standing beside him, took two steps back as though he really didn’t plan on helping.</p>
<p>Just as Gulli and Sadie were wondering how Zhou Wen was going to deal with the group of Flying Beasts and Fairies, Zhou Wen finally unsheathed his saber.</p>
<p>A saber beam flashed but Gulli and Sadie only saw the flash dissipate. Before they could see the blade, it had already returned to its sheath.</p>
<p>The Flying Beasts and Fairies that filled the sky didn’t seem to be affected as they charged at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What the hell? It’s useless,” Gulli muttered.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, the Flying Beasts and Fairies were split in half. Hundreds of Flying Beasts spewed out blood as their dismembered corpses fell.</p>
<p>More than ten Fairies were covered in blood, their bodies beheaded. Even a hundred meters away, the Mutated Fairy who hadn’t charged over had its head chopped off.</p>
<p>Instantly, blood splattered everywhere in the cave; not a single Flying Beast or Fairy survived.</p>
<p>Gulli and Sadie’s expressions changed drastically as though someone had stabbed them in the heart. Their faces turned pale and a cold sweat broke out on their foreheads.</p>
<p>The two of them exchanged looks before retreating. They slowly walked out of Lotus Flower Cave.</p>
<p>After exiting Lotus Flower Cave, Gulli took a deep breath and wiped away the cold sweat on his forehead. He asked Sadie in bewilderment, “Sis, did you see how he slashed out just now?”</p>
<p>“It was too fast. I didn’t see it clearly, but it’s alright. I have the Eye of Odin. I’ll take my time to have a look when I get back.” It was unknown when the eye that flew out had returned to Sadie’s eye socket.</p>
<p>When the two of them entered their dormitory, Sadie closed the door and windows. Only then did her eyes glow with blue light. The light that shot out formed a three-dimensional projection.</p>
<p>The projection was the scene of Zhou Wen and Feng Qiuyan in the cave. The scene was like a video that was played by Sadie’s eyes.</p>
<p>At the moment Zhou Wen drew his saber, Sadie slowed down the projection. The Flying Beasts’ actions slowed down, but they could only see a saber flash. Before they could see what the saber in Zhou Wen’s hand looked like, it had already returned to its scabbard.</p>
<p>“Impossible… How can it be so fast… Even if he has advanced to the Epic stage… it’s impossible for him to advance so quickly…” Gulli’s face was filled with disbelief.</p>
<p>Sadie’s expression was solemn, but she didn’t say anything. She slowed down the speed of the projection once again. This time, after slowing down, the Flying Beasts’ movements were jittery as it reeled forward frame by frame.</p>
<p>This time, they finally saw Zhou Wen’s strike clearly. The saber was like a stream of light, but in fact, it wasn’t just a saber.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body leaned forward as he drew his saber. Instantly, he flew up with the saber and drew an arc as he shuttled through the Fairy beast horde.</p>
<p>Under such slow replay speeds, he remained so fast that it left them dazzled. The saber beam streaked across the Flying Beasts and Fairies’ bodies like lightning before finally slashing across the Mutated Fairy’s neck. After completing a circle, Zhou Wen returned to his original spot. The saber returned to its scabbard as though he had never moved.</p>
<p>The entire process looked pleasing to the eye. The entire process was smooth, as though it was an agile and speedy flash of lightning.</p>
<p>Gulli broke out into a cold sweat as he looked at Sadie with a stiff neck. “Sis, how slow was your Eye of Odin’s replay speed?”</p>
<p>“Seven times,” Sadie replied with a strange expression.</p>
<p>“Impossible!” Upon hearing this answer, Gulli immediately shouted. “When your Eye of Odin lowers the speed by two times, the fastest Legendary expert will become as slow as a snail. At the speed of four times, even an Epic stage will also be like a turtle crawl. At the speed of six times, even a top Epic expert who focuses on speed will become like a super slow motion scene. How can his saber technique and movement technique be so fast at a seven times slowdown? Even if he’s already a top Epic, it’s impossible for him to have such a fast saber and movement technique.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s indeed impossible. The Eye of Odin was slowed down seven times. Only the speed of a Mythical stage expert can produce such an effect,” said Sadie.</p>
<p>“How can he be at the Mythical stage? Impossible. Sis, are you mistaken?” How could Gulli believe that Zhou Wen, who was less than two years older than him, be at the Mythical stage?</p>
<p>“It’s impossible for my Eye of Odin to make a mistake. Of course, it’s impossible for him to be at the Mythical stage. Then, there’s only one possibility left. He trained his saber technique to become a divine technique, which is why he has such a fast speed,” Sadie said with a burning gaze.</p>
<p>“Divine saber technique!” Gulli was stunned. This answer was still unacceptable to him, but he knew very well that Sadie’s Eye of Odin couldn’t be wrong.</p>
<p>They had originally come here to right Lance’s reputation. Although Gulli hadn’t advanced to the Epic stage, he was already very close. As for Sadie, she had advanced to the Epic stage and obtained the Life Soul, Eye of Odin, which was almost like a bug in computer programs.</p>
<p>Gulli originally believed that no matter how strong Zhou Wen was, even if he could defeat him, he was definitely not Sadie’s match.</p>
<p>But now, he felt endless despair. A person who had mastered a divine technique at the Epic stage, and him being only seventeen years old—just the thought of it left him dizzy.</p>
<p>Even in the history of the six families, there had never been such a terrifying person.</p>
<p>610 Golden Overlord Sword</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>A crisp sound came from the phone. Zhou Wen saw an item drop in-game and nearly jumped out of bed.</p>
<p>After returning yesterday, Zhou Wen had spent the entire night grinding dungeons. When he finally killed the Golden Battle God Halberd in the morning, a Companion Egg dropped for the third time.</p>
<p>Is the drop rate for the Golden Battle God Halberd that high? Zhou Wen looked at the three identical halberds with slightly different stats and skills. He felt a little depressed.</p>
<p>An additional Mythical Companion Beast was indeed able to greatly enhance Zhou Wen’s strength. However, when facing different situations, the same Companion Beast’s ability made for weaker adaptation.</p>
<p>When restrained, the same Companion Beasts would be restrained together. They would be limited and prevent him from adapting to the situation.</p>
<p>However, for fusion, there’s no suitable Companion Beast to fuse with the Golden Battle God Halberd. Zhou Wen matched his Companion Beasts with the Golden Battle God Halberd again.</p>
<p>In the final match, the compatibility between Overlord Sword and Golden Battle God Halberd was the highest, but it was only 41%. With less than 50% fusion compatibility, the chances of a fusion success were very low.</p>
<p>The only fusion plan with a high compatibility score was the Golden Battle God Halberd and the Golden Battle God Halberd. However, the most important function of the Golden Battle God Halberd was its Life Soul—Golden Divine Light—and Unstoppable.</p>
<p>With these two abilities, the Golden Battle God Halberd’s effects could already be considered to be at its peak. Even if he could enhance its attributes or have a few more skills after fusion, the main functions of the Golden Battle God Halberd wouldn’t have any qualitative improvement. It would be better to keep two Golden Battle God Halberds so that he could be stronger in battle.</p>
<p>I already have three Golden Battle God Halberds. I can take the gamble with one. With 41% compatibility, the chances of success can’t be considered very low. If the Golden Battle God Halberd can fuse with Overlord Sword’s abilities, the best outcome will be having two skills—Unstoppable and Ever-Victorious—at the same time. Then, releasing sword beams being augmented by these two skills, that would be really impressive. However, this is only the best outcome. Ignoring the possibility of fusion failure, even if the fusion succeeds, it might not turn out the way I wish. The skills may be retained, but the Life Providence and Life Soul can also be changed. It might not be able to retain its Mythical stage… After some consideration, Zhou Wen decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>Since Overlord Sword isn’t of much use anymore and I have three Golden Divine Battle Halberds, so be it if I lose one. Zhou Wen didn’t hold much hope as he placed the Golden Battle God Halberd and Overlord Sword together into the fusion column before clicking on fusion.</p>
<p>The two Companion Beasts emitted light at the same time before fusing into one, turning the entire screen into a snow-white glow. When the light gradually dissipated, a new Companion Beast appeared in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>I succeeded… Zhou Wen was delighted as he sized up the Companion Beast.</p>
<p>As the two were already incubated Companion Beasts, the newly fused Companion Beast was affected by the two Companion Beasts, causing a change in appearance.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s first impression was that it was a tycoon with a shiny, golden blade. However, this blade was extremely odd. From its appearance, it looked like a greatsword.</p>
<p>However, two short blades protruded from the two sides of the greatsword’s hilt. They were like two side blades of the trident, making it look both like a greatsword or a mutated trident.</p>
<p>After pulling out the information on the new Companion Beast, Zhou Wen carefully looked at its stats.</p>
<p>Golden Overlord Sword: Mythical</p>
<p>Life Providence: Sword Sovereign of God</p>
<p>Life Soul: Golden Sword Aura</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Benevolence of the Battle God</p>
<p>Strength: 79</p>
<p>Speed: 72</p>
<p>Constitution: 79</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 68</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Ever-Victorious, Fangwheel Sword Flash</p>
<p>Companion Form: Golden Greatsword</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned slightly. It looked like its stats weren’t bad and it seemed to have fused well in all aspects, but it lacked an important skill—Unstoppable—a skill that came with Golden Battle God Halberd.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he did not know if the Golden Sword Aura’s effect could be compared to the Golden Divine Light.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took the golden greatsword to try it in-game and realized that the Golden Sword Aura could actually be shot out as a Fangwheel Sword Flash. Furthermore, its might wasn’t inferior to the Golden Divine Light.</p>
<p>It was just that it lacked Unstoppable skill. Its destructive power was slightly weaker, but with Ever-Victorious’s augmentation, it was not too much weaker.</p>
<p>Although the Golden Overlord Sword’s stats and skills were slightly inferior to the Golden Battle God Halberd, its Golden Sword Aura could be released. This was a qualitative leap, raising Zhou Wen’s combat ability. If he had to choose out of the two, Zhou Wen would still choose the Golden Overlord Sword.</p>
<p>Looking at the Golden Battle God Halberd Companion Egg that hadn’t hatched, Zhou Wen matched it with the Golden Overlord Sword and realized that the compatibility was higher than before. It was as high as 69%.</p>
<p>With the Golden Battle God Halberd Companion Egg as a supplementary ingredient, I can strengthen it without changing the Golden Overlord Sword’s foundation. However, I wonder how much it can increase. It would be great if I could fuse Unstoppable into it. Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and placed the Golden Battle God Halberd Companion Egg on it again. He decided to fuse it again.</p>
<p>Although the Golden Overlord Sword was already very powerful, Zhou Wen felt that something was missing without Unstoppable.</p>
<p>It had to be said that Zhou Wen had some perfectionist inclinations.</p>
<p>Seeing the light engulf the Golden Overlord Sword and Companion Egg, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but feel nervous. Although the success rate was close to 70%, Zhou Wen had previously failed at a higher success rate. Failure wasn’t impossible.</p>
<p>My heart is in a mess. I need to blank my mind… Just as the fusion began, his phone suddenly rang. It gave Zhou Wen a fright. He picked up his phone and saw that it was Wang Lu’s number.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? Why did you take so long to answer the call?” Wang Lu’s voice sounded from the phone.</p>
<p>“I’m gaming,” Zhou Wen answered. He turned his head and saw that the fusion had ended. The Golden Overlord Sword was still there and hadn’t disappeared.</p>
<p>“Can’t you have other activities other than gaming?” Wang Lu said unhappily.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to move,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>Wang Lu knew that Zhou Wen wasn’t a talkative person, but she still felt indignant. After calming herself down, she continued, “I’ve successfully advanced to the Epic stage. However, due to the problem of cultivating my Essence Energy Art, I’ve degenerated to the Mortal stage. I need time to recultivate again. I won’t be able to return to school anytime soon. When I wasn’t around, the antelope and Little Feifei must have suffered quite a lot. You must have forgotten to feed them. Do you now know that it’s impossible without me?”</p>
<p>“Not at all. When I wasn’t around, An Sheng would feed them. They had plenty of good food to eat,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“Goodbye.” Wang Lu decisively hung up. She felt that if she continued chatting, she would be infuriated by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Why did you hang up on me? Zhou Wen put down his phone and looked at the post-fusion stats of the Golden Overlord Sword.</p>
<h3 id='chapter611'>Chapter 611 Competition for the Top Rank</h3>
<p>Golden Overlord Sword: MythicalLife Providence: Sword Sovereign of God</p>
<p>Life Soul: Golden Sword Aura</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Benevolence of the Battle God</p>
<p>Strength: 80</p>
<p>Speed: 76</p>
<p>Constitution: 80</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 78</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Ever-Victorious, Unstoppable, Fangwheel Sword Flash, Battle God’s Radiance.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Golden Greatsword</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted when he saw this. Not only was Unstoppable retained, but he had also gained Golden Battle God Halberd’s Battle God’s Radiance. It was an AOE skill, and it was pretty good.</p>
<p>Furthermore, its stats had increased significantly. It could be considered a top-notch Mythical Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen entered the game with the Golden Overlord Sword. Together with his divine skill, Transcendent Flying Immortal, killing dimensional creatures was simple. Even Mythical creatures couldn’t withstand its sharpness.</p>
<p>I’m better with swords at the end of the day. The Golden Battle God Halberd’s Golden Divine Light couldn’t be released, so it was quite flawed. Zhou Wen compared the Golden Battle God Halberd to the Golden Overlord Sword and immediately gave up on the Golden Battle God Halberd, letting it attack in its own form.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, quick! Check out the livestream.” Zhou Wen was still immersed in the joy of the success of the Golden Overlord Sword’s fusion when Li Xuan suddenly sent a message.</p>
<p>“What livestream?” Zhou Wen replied.</p>
<p>“It’s the cube’s ranking. The second-ranked Death of the Underworld is challenging the number one Primordial Sword Immortal. Holy sh*t, Primordial Sword Immortal has accepted the challenge. Quick, take a look,” Li Xuan replied.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly opened the webpage and immediately saw all kinds of headlines. They were all live-streaming the battle. He randomly clicked on one and the scene that popped up on his phone was that of the cube’s arena. Death of the Underworld and Primordial Sword Immortal floated on both sides of the arena.</p>
<p>The battle between the two Companion Beasts alarmed the entire world. It wasn’t just the Federation, but even overseas spectators were watching the battle closely.</p>
<p>Death of the Underworld was first on the rankings in the beginning but was relegated to second because of Primordial Sword Immortal. Ever since then, despite many Companion Beasts joining the rankings, none shook their rankings. From this, it could be seen that these two Companion Beasts were extremely terrifying by the cube’s standards.</p>
<p>Strange, how can Death of the Underworld be challenging Primordial Sword Immortal? Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>An Sheng had told him that Death of the Underworld was likely a Companion Beast of a West District hero family. However, the tradition of the family was somewhat different from ordinary families. They didn’t have any last names. This was similar to Lance’s family from the North District. Neither family had a fixed last name.</p>
<p>Typically, people liked to use the Family Clan of Gods to address the West District’s family clan. As for Lance’s family clan, it was named the Ultimate Family Clan.</p>
<p>Death of the Underworld was one of the top Mythical Companion Beasts in the Family Clan of Gods. Across the six families, there weren’t many Mythical Companion Beasts of this level.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally believed that the Family Clan of Gods would definitely leave Death of the Underworld to the end before attempting to race to the top of the rankings. He never expected them to take action so quickly.</p>
<p>An Sheng had also once determined that the vile characters overseas couldn’t hold back and would end up probing Primordial Sword Immortal’s strength first. Clearly, his judgment was wrong.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Zhou Wen and An Sheng who didn’t expect it. Even the other families of the six families didn’t think that the Family Clan of Gods would let the Death of the Underworld challenge Primordial Sword Immortal so early.</p>
<p>What are those fellows up to? Senator Cape watched the livestream and frowned.</p>
<p>Among the six families, the Dugu family dominated the South District. The Ultimate Family Clan resided in the North District, and the East District was controlled by the Xia family and the Zhang family. The West District was the Cape family and the Family Clan of Gods.</p>
<p>The relationship between the two was very complicated. Usually, the two families were in competition with each other in the West District. It could be said that they were at loggerheads with each other. However, when faced with external danger, the two families would work together to form an alliance.</p>
<p>Senator Cape also believed that the Family Clan of Gods would only get Death of the Underworld to challenge Primordial Sword Immortal in the last few days. He never expected them to take action so quickly.</p>
<p>In the arena, Primordial Sword Immortal launched an attack. A red sword beam shot out from the ruby on its hilt, instantly arriving in front of Death of the Underworld.</p>
<p>Death of the Underworld didn’t seem to react as it remained standing there. The red sword beam stabbed into its body.</p>
<p>When everyone saw the red sword beam stab into the gray cloak, they were surprised to discover that Death of the Underworld’s body was like a phantom. The red sword beam failed to injure it at all and directly penetrated its body.</p>
<p>The red sword beam seemed to be alive as it automatically flew back and shuttled back and forth from Death of the Underworld’s body, but it was useless.</p>
<p>Death of the Underworld’s body was like a specter. The red sword beam could not touch it.</p>
<p>Death of the Underworld’s body is about the same as my Ghost Bride. Zhou Wen immediately understood what was going on.</p>
<p>With the red sword beam useless, Death of the Underworld finally moved, its figure vanishing into thin air. It wasn’t because it was fast, but because it had undergone true teleportation. When Death of the Underworld appeared again, it had already arrived beside Primordial Sword Immortal. A ghostly hand formed from blue-black flames grabbed at the hilt of Primordial Sword Immortal’s sword. It was almost touching the hilt.</p>
<p>A sword hum shook the surroundings. Primordial Sword Immortal, which had never been unsheathed, finally tore out of the scabbard. The stone sword automatically flew out of the scabbard and slashed at Death of the Underworld’s palm with an immortal-like sword beam.</p>
<p>Death of the Underworld actually seemed to be afraid. It didn’t dare to receive the stone sword’s attack head-on like before. It flashed once again and dodged the terrifying sword beam.</p>
<p>The ancient sword levitated in the air as the sword beam swirled, sweeping towards Death of the Underworld that had appeared after its teleportation. Death of the Underworld teleported several times, but it was unable to shake off the sword beam.</p>
<p>Just as the sword beam was about to slash at Death of the Underworld, Death of the Underworld suddenly pulled open its gray cloak. The blue-black light in its body erupted and instantly enveloped the entire arena.</p>
<p>Instantly, the screen on the phone turned blue-black. It was as though countless stars were circulating between the blue and black colors, like the universe in the night sky.</p>
<p>Apart from that, there was nothing else.</p>
<p>Is this an Essence Energy Skill or a Wheel of Destiny’s power? Zhou Wen looked at the screen and frowned.</p>
<p>Others were as anxious as Zhou Wen. They didn’t know what had happened in the arena, so they could only stare blankly at the blue-black galaxy.</p>
<p>It only took a moment before the blue-black light in the arena suddenly converged. A sword beam tore through the air. It was the stone sword.</p>
<p>It’s finally out… Just as everyone was feeling pleasantly surprised, they realized that Death of the Underworld had already retreated from the battlefield. After the battle ended, Death of the Underworld’s ranking didn’t change. It was still ranked second—clearly, it had lost.</p>
<p>612 Activity Division</p>
<p>“What’s going on? I didn’t see the most important part!” Li Xuan sent Zhou Wen a message.</p>
<p>“Although we didn’t see the most important part, there’s already plenty to be seen,” Zhou Wen replied.</p>
<p>“What did you see?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“Death of the Underworld has the power of a spatial domain. If one wants to fight Death of the Underworld, one has to be prepared to engage in an away match. Primordial Sword Immortal was able to defeat Death of the Underworld within the latter’s spatial domain, so perhaps it also has spatial powers, or perhaps its offensive strength is so powerful that it can destroy space itself. Regardless of the possibilities, the strength of Primordial Sword Immortal is already beyond imagination.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen paused before saying, “The major families should have professional analysts that can provide more professional analysis. Let’s wait for them.”</p>
<p>“What I want to see the most is the Family Clan of Gods’ analysis report. I didn’t get a kick from this battle,” Li Xuan said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“It’s indeed not satisfying.” Zhou Wen had the same thought. Now, the only person who knew more about Primordial Sword Immortal was the Family Clan of Gods. However, he was certain that they wouldn’t easily leak the information they had.</p>
<p>Indeed, in less than two days, An Sheng received news that the Family Clan of Gods had indeed come up with a comprehensive analysis. They even publicly put the results up for sale. However, the price was just too high. Even the other large families were hesitant about buying their information.</p>
<p>No one could guarantee that their analysis had any decisive use.</p>
<p>It’s a pity that my pets don’t have spatial powers. In a fight, others will see everything. There’s no chance of selling information. Otherwise, I could sell it and earn a fortune. Zhou Wen had an idea, but no matter how he thought about it, there was no way to keep his information confidential.</p>
<p>Beep! Beep! Beep! There was a notification from his phone. Tyrant Behemoth was hungry once again.</p>
<p>After this fellow advanced to the Mythical stage, its demand for food had increased even more. If not for the Essence Crystal mines in the Poison Bat tunnel, Tyrant Behemoth would have long starved to death.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Essence Crystal mine would respawn together with the dungeon. Every time Tyrant Behemoth entered the Poison Bat Cave, it would eat the bats and Essence Crystal ores. When it finished eating, it would be 70% full. A second meal could last it two to three days.</p>
<p>What a terrifying appetite. In reality, I really can’t afford to rear it. After Zhou Wen took Tyrant Behemoth to have its feast, he went to grind Torch Dragon and Qiongqi.</p>
<p>Ever since the Torch Dragon egg dropped, no Companion Beasts had dropped. Instead, Qiongqi dropped an Essence Energy Skill Crystal. Unfortunately, his stats didn’t meet the requirements, so he could only have it disappear on the next respawn.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon also dropped a rare spatial stat crystal. This was one of Zhou Wen’s motivations to farm it.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Li Xuan called everyone over for a Xuanwen Club activity. Zhou Wen came into the activity room and saw Gulli and Sadie. However, today was a little odd. Gulli didn’t insist on challenging him.</p>
<p>Gu Dian, Feng Qiuyan, Fang Ruoxi, and Tian Xiangdong attended the event. Only Huang Ji didn’t come.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sent a message asking Huang Ji what was going on. Huang Ji said that he had found a huge investor and was discussing some details with them.</p>
<p>If the investment was successful, his “Dimensional” game could be produced by a proper team. Not only could the map be expanded, but the details of the game could also be optimized.</p>
<p>Who has such poor acumen to actually invest in this game? Although Zhou Wen felt that Huang Ji’s game wasn’t bad, the dungeons were too small. Furthermore, they were dungeons that humans were familiar with, so its effects were limited.</p>
<p>Unless someone provided information on new dimensional zones, the game “Dimensional” ultimately wouldn’t be of much use.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only used this game as an excuse and didn’t think of relying on it to get rich.</p>
<p>However, Huang Ji revealed that not only did the investor bring in funds, but he would also bring large amounts of information regarding relatively new dimensional zones. This was also one of the reasons Huang Ji was tempted and willing to let outsiders invest.</p>
<p>“Information about new dimensional zones? And large amounts of them? This isn’t something ordinary people can obtain. Is it a scam?” Zhou Wen was somewhat worried.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. The other party has a military background. His backer should be Deputy Governor Qin. There won’t be any problems in this area.” Huang Ji had already made plans, as though he had long found out the other party’s background.</p>
<p>“If it really is Deputy Governor Qin supporting this, the game might really become popular.” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He never expected the game to attract Qin Wufu’s attention.</p>
<p>“That’s right. However, they have a request. If we let them invest, the dungeon access will be split into three levels. There will be dungeons for public downloads on the Internet. College dungeons that only allow students of Sunset College to download. It will be forbidden to share with others. Another will be the military dungeons, open only to the military. All the information is confidential. Without their approval, the contents of the military dungeons cannot be released in other versions, Huang Ji said.</p>
<p>“That’s reasonable.” Zhou Wen felt that there was no problem.</p>
<p>“Yes, we’re in the midst of a discussion. I’ll inform you of the outcome.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” When Zhou Wen made his initial investment, he had mentioned that he didn’t care about these matters. All he did was wait for the money. These problems were to be decided by Huang Ji himself.</p>
<p>Gulli and Sadie were very quiet today. Gulli, who had been so arrogant when he first entered the school, obediently followed Li Xuan’s activity arrangements. He didn’t say anything arrogant, as though he had changed into a completely different person. It surprised Li Xuan.</p>
<p>He originally imagined that he would have to give these two geniuses from the Ultimate Family Clan another lesson or two to make them behave.</p>
<p>“Today, our target is the Demonized Generals of Tiger Cage Pass. By killing the most Demonized Generals, you can obtain a special pass that we have prepared. As Tiger Cage Pass is relatively dangerous, we will be acting in pairs so that you can also take care of each other. The two people in the same group can’t move separately.” Li Xuan paused before saying, “Gulli, you and Little Yanyan will be in the same team. Sadie, you and I are in the same team…”</p>
<p>“President, I wish to be in the same group as Zhou Wen,” Sadie suddenly said.</p>
<p>Li Xuan scratched his nose and said, “That’s fine. It’s ok if you want to follow Old Zhou. Xiangdong, follow me. Ruoxi, you and Gu Dian will be in the same team.”</p>
<p>After the allocation was done, everyone headed for Tiger Cage Pass. As Tiger Cage Pass was very large, they split up into teams to search for Demonized Generals.</p>
<p>Tiger Cage Pass didn’t have any secrets for Zhou Wen. All he did was come out to get some action. It could be considered as letting others know that he still cultivated.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, are you interested in competing?” Sadie suddenly asked Zhou Wen. </p>
<h3 id='chapter613'>Chapter 613 Eye of Odin</h3>
<p>“Not interested.” Zhou Wen shook his head.Zhou Wen was considering how to kill Primordial Sword Immortal. He had no interest in an opponent at Sadie’s level. Even if she was a peerless genius, she was at most at the Epic stage.</p>
<p>The Epic stage was already too weak for Zhou Wen. He had condensed five Life Souls which was equivalent to someone advancing to the Epic stage five times. He really didn’t find the Epic stage impressive.</p>
<p>Even the six families wouldn’t randomly give a Mythical Companion Beast to such a young genius. This was because they had too little combat experience and were too young. Their minds weren’t staid enough and with mighty strength, they easily took risks. That way, they would die even faster.</p>
<p>An Epic expert without a Mythical Companion Beast was no challenge for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Sadie seemed to have expected that Zhou Wen would reject her, so she wasn’t angry. She continued, “I know you are very strong. If it were a life-and-death battle, I definitely wouldn’t be your match. However, if we compete in the acumen, I believe you aren’t my match.”</p>
<p>“Since you are so confident, I’ll leave the Demonized General hunting mission to you.” Zhou Wen retreated a little. A group of Demonized Soldiers had already discovered them and were charging over.</p>
<p>Although Sadie felt that Zhou Wen was looking down on her, she didn’t mind.</p>
<p>In the past, she would definitely have thought that Zhou Wen was too arrogant. However, after seeing Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal, she felt that he had the right to be arrogant.</p>
<p>A seventeen-year-old person who had already mastered a divine technique could be as arrogant as he wanted. It wasn’t excessive.</p>
<p>Sadie summoned an ice sword and charged at the Demonized Soldiers. The Demonized Soldiers were naturally not her match and were easily killed by her. They weren’t even considered a warm-up.</p>
<p>Seeing how Zhou Wen ignored her, Sadie tactfully didn’t say anything else. All she did was wait for an opportunity to make Zhou Wen think of her in a different light.</p>
<p>She was very confident in her Eye of Odin Life Soul. In her family’s evaluation, the Eye of Odin Life Soul was S+ rank. It was even stronger than the average S rank, a Life Soul akin to a bug in games.</p>
<p>Although Sadie’s Eye of Odin had only just condensed and was still a Primordial Body, its ability was already excellent.</p>
<p>Previously, it had been used to record videos, but in fact, it was just a trick of the Eye of Odin. What was truly impressive about the Eye of Odin was that it could observe an opponent in battle.</p>
<p>Now, Sadie’s limit was to slow things down by seven times. In battle, if she used this ability, all trajectories would appear seven times slower in her eyes.</p>
<p>This multiplier was calculated according to the standards of the Eye of Odin. It wasn’t slowing down the object by seven times.</p>
<p>In other words, someone’s seemingly fast attacks would become very slow in Sadie’s eyes. It made it easy for her to dodge those attacks or have enough time to think of a way to deal with them.</p>
<p>The Eye of Odin didn’t only strengthen her vision; in fact, the real target of the Eye of Odin was to strengthen her brain. If the brain’s thinking speed and reaction couldn’t keep up, it could easily cause a situation where one couldn’t react in time despite being able to detect it.</p>
<p>However, the Eye of Odin had strengthened her brain, allowing Sadie’s brain to think and react faster. This was the truly terrifying part.</p>
<p>A saber technique that looked as fast as lightning looked like slow motion in Sadie’s eyes when she slowed it down by seven times. At the same time, her mind raced with all sorts of countermeasures at lightning speed.</p>
<p>Now, Sadie’s only flaw was that because her eyesight and brainpower were too strong, her body couldn’t keep up with her brain’s reaction speed, causing her to have synchronization issues.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, a speed of four to five times was her limit. Her body’s speed could keep up with her eyesight and brainpower. Any higher, her body’s movement speed wouldn’t be able to keep up even if her brain issued an order.</p>
<p>In terms of combat abilities, Sadie knew that she was far from Zhou Wen’s match, but in terms of acumen, Sadie didn’t believe that she would lose to him.</p>
<p>As she charged forward, the ice sword in Sadie’s hand mercilessly harvested the lives of the Demonized Soldiers. Even if she encountered Demonized Generals, she could still kill them with one strike.</p>
<p>Her sword techniques didn’t have any unnecessary movements. She could always use the simplest method to kill her enemy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed behind Sadie without making a move. Seeing that Sadie was about to rush into the range of the Tiger Cage Demonized General, he said, “Let’s end here. Stop walking forward.”</p>
<p>“I heard that Tiger Cage Pass has a very powerful dimensional creature guarding it and ordinary people can’t charge in. Why don’t we have a bet? If I can charge into the city and kill the dimensional creature guarding the gates, it’ll be considered my victory. If I can’t charge in, or if I can’t kill the dimensional creature guarding the gates, count it as my loss. If I lose, I can tell you a secret about the cube ranking. If I’m lucky to win, I hope you can officially spar with me. Just the two of us. Let’s see who’s acumen is better,” Sadie said.</p>
<p>“What secret?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“It’s not a secret if I tell you, but I guarantee with my character that this secret is definitely worth it,” Sadie said with certainty.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll bet with you. Are you sure you want to kill the strongest dimensional creature in Tiger Cage Pass?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Let’s smack palms to make an oath. It’s a deal?” Sadie extended her hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate as he extended his palm and slapped Sadie’s palm.</p>
<p>Tiger Cage Demonized General was already a top Epic creature. No matter how talented Sadie was, killing Tiger Cage Demonized General was not bad.</p>
<p>However, what was truly terrifying in Tiger Cage Pass wasn’t the Tiger Cage Demonized General, but the Elegant Emperor’s Avatar Puppet. Although that fellow was only at the Epic stage, his difficulty was already close to the Mythical stage. Zhou Wen didn’t think Sadie had the ability to kill the Elegant Emperor’s Avatar Puppet.</p>
<p>After retracting her palm, Sadie’s lips curled up slightly. She wore a confident expression as she charged towards Tiger Cage Pass with her ice sword.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched from the side, prepared to help at any moment. If Sadie were to fail, he couldn’t watch her die here.</p>
<p>Just as Sadie stepped into the range of the Tiger Cage Demonized General’s shooting range, she saw an arrow shoot over with a strong spiral force. It was shockingly fast.</p>
<p>However, Sadie didn’t panic. When the arrow reached her, she took a slight step to the side and dodged the arrow. At the same time, she slashed the ice sword in her hand, landing the arrow. She continued rushing towards Tiger Cage Pass.</p>
<p>The storm-like arrows immediately shot over.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched as Sadie moved in a small area and brandished the ice sword in her hand. She easily passed through the arrow rain and continued charging at Tiger Cage Pass.</p>
<p>This Sadie really has some ability. Zhou Wen realized that when Sadie passed through the rain of arrows, she used a very small movement to dodge a large number of arrows. Every time the ice sword struck out, it struck the most critical arrow.</p>
<p>The entire process was as exact as a computer’s calculated path. There was no waste of stamina through any unnecessary actions.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Wen himself couldn’t do better than Sadie.</p>
<h3 id='chapter614'>Chapter 614 Eye of Hell</h3>
<p>Could it be that Sadie has already reached the Minute Subtlety realm at such a young age? Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.Back when Lance visited, he had only just reached the edge of Minute Subtlety. Sadie was a little younger than Lance, yet she had completely mastered Minute Subtlety. From Zhou Wen’s point of view, this was extremely shocking.</p>
<p>Unbeknown to Zhou Wen, Sadie purely relied on the powers of Eye of Odin. Her true realm was inferior to Lance, so she naturally wasn’t as good as Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, Eye of Odin was like a bug in games. To outsiders, Sadie was simply at some greater mastery of Minute Subtlety. No matter how intense the battle was, she could always calmly achieve perfection.</p>
<p>Soon, Sadie rushed to the top of the city and began fighting the Tiger Cage Demonized General.</p>
<p>Tiger Cage Demonized General was slightly stronger than Sadie in every aspect, but under the effects of the Eye of Odin, she could counter all his moves. He couldn’t injure Sadie at all. Instead, he was severely restrained by Sadie. It was only a matter of time before he was killed.</p>
<p>There’s actually such a genius in this world? Zhou Wen looked at Sadie’s battle and was increasingly certain that she had achieved greater mastery of Minute Subtlety. Otherwise, how could she have reached such a stage?</p>
<p>She should be around my age or younger than me. Since she can do it, there’s no reason I can’t do it. Zhou Wen carefully observed Sadie’s actions as he switched his Essence Energy Skill to Small Perfection of Wisdom.</p>
<p>The Eight Perfections Wisdom Life Providence and Hell King Life Soul also worked at the same time, making his senses extremely sharp.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sat on the Chi’s back and watched the battle. At the same time, he put himself in Sadie’s shoes. He imagined a battle with the Tiger Cage Demonized General. In this battle, what was the difference between his choices and Sadie’s choices?</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen realized that although his choice wasn’t wrong, he found them a little crude compared to Sadie. He wasn’t as meticulous as Sadie.</p>
<p>What exactly am I lacking? As Zhou Wen thought, he gradually gained some insight.</p>
<p>There’s a saying that goes, “Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will never be defeated.” The reason why gods are revered is that they have terrifying clairvoyant abilities. From this, one can see the importance of the word “know.” What Minute Subtlety needs is clairvoyance. By observing the other party’s actions, one can derive information about the other party and exploit the information obtained… As Zhou Wen’s mind raced, his Hell King Life Soul also expanded.</p>
<p>The Small Perfection of Wisdom Essence Energy Art was an Essence Energy Art that strengthened one’s Constitution. The Eight Perfections Wisdom and Hell King Life Soul also strengthened his Constitution, but it was different from the typical strengthening. Instead, it was a way to strengthen one’s mind first.</p>
<p>The stronger Zhou Wen’s mind was, the stronger the feedback his body received.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s comprehension, the Hell King Life Soul became stronger. As for the Hell King Life Soul, it was one with Zhou Wen. The growth of the Hell King Life Soul immediately reflected back on Zhou Wen, making him feel increasingly sensitive.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a vertical eye on Zhou Wen’s glabella opened. It was the Eye of Hell that belonged to the Hell King. At the instant it opened, it seemed to have countless wraiths howling in pain.</p>
<p>The moment the Eye of Hell opened, the space around Zhou Wen seemed to change. It wasn’t a real eye, but a door that led to hell.</p>
<p>When the Eye of Hell opened, Zhou Wen’s body experienced a strange feeling. It was as though there was another feeling beyond his senses. This feeling made his sensual organs feel extremely strange.</p>
<p>So this is the Hell King’s true ability. This should be the so-called Eighth Sense, right? To break through the understanding of spatial dimension… Under the effects of the Hell King Life Soul, Zhou Wen didn’t even need to look to sense the minute changes in his surroundings.</p>
<p>However, he gradually realized that the feeling he had when he was Hell King didn’t seem to be as simple as an eighth sense.</p>
<p>Apart from a normal feeling, he also discovered a strange phenomenon in every creature. It was an indescribable feeling.</p>
<p>He seemed to see a transparent flame burning on all the creatures. Some of the transparent flames were bigger than others, burning like a bonfire.</p>
<p>Some of the flames were relatively small, like fire plumes. It was as though the slightest breath could extinguish them.</p>
<p>What was even stranger was that the flames were transparent and colorless. It should have been impossible to see them, but he could. Even if he closed his eyes, he could sense the existence of the flames.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen could vaguely sense that the transparent and colorless flames seemed to have some connection with the Eye of Hell at his glabella.</p>
<p>Could it be that the flames I see are actually the legendary karmic sinflames? Zhou Wen guessed inwardly, but he wasn’t confident.</p>
<p>Legend had it that karmic sinflames were the flames of sins. Every time someone did something evil, he would have more karmic sinflames on him. After he went to hell, he would be burned by the karmic sinflames.</p>
<p>The greater the sins, the more karmic sinflames there were. This also prolonged the burning in hell. One had to wait for the karmic sinflames to burn out before they could reincarnate.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was only guessing, unsure if what he saw were karmic sinflames.</p>
<p>Sadie was still fighting the Tiger Cage Demonized General. Her Eye of Odin was indeed powerful. Despite fighting someone stronger than herself, she suppressed the Tiger Cage Demonized General and eventually killed him with one strike.</p>
<p>The entire process was smooth and fluid. She didn’t give the Tiger Cage Demonized General a chance. The Tiger Cage Demonized General didn’t even manage to touch her clothes. Even Sadie was very satisfied with her performance.</p>
<p>Standing on the city wall, Sadie said to Zhou Wen who was outside the city with a smile, “Zhou Wen, I won.”</p>
<p>“See what’s behind you first,” Zhou Wen said calmly.</p>
<p>Sadie was slightly taken aback. She turned her head and saw a strange person wearing a mask standing on top of a tower in the city.</p>
<p>Before Sadie could do anything, the strange person held a stack of yellow paper in his hand and threw it into the air. The yellow paper scattered, turning out to be paper figurines.</p>
<p>However, when the paper figurines landed, they turned into Tiger Cage Demonized Generals. There were more than ten of them.</p>
<p>More than ten Tiger Cage Demonized Generals charged forward and immediately surrounded Sadie.</p>
<p>Sadie was alarmed. She could still deal with a single Tiger Cage Demonized General. If these Tiger Cage Demonized Generals had the same combat strength as the previous Tiger Cage Demonized Generals, she was definitely no match for them.</p>
<p>She originally hoped that these Tiger Cage Demonized Generals were only paper tigers and didn’t have any true strength, but after a short battle, she realized that they were equally terrifying.</p>
<p>Sadie fought many alone. Relying on the ability of Eye of Odin, she constantly dodged and moved around, ensuring that she remained safe. However, under the siege of the Tiger Cage Demonized Generals, Sadie’s physical reaction was no longer able to keep up with her acumen and brain’s reactions. All she could do was try her best to find flaws in the siege and use the time difference to dodge.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched with relish. Sadie’s speed couldn’t be considered fast, but her ability, which was akin to Minute Subtlety, was indeed very powerful. She wasn’t injured under the siege of more than ten Tiger Cage Demonized Generals. She was indeed extraordinarily strong.</p>
<h3 id='chapter615'>Chapter 615 Benefits of the Ranking</h3>
<p>With the augmentation of his Life Providence and Life Soul, Zhou Wen realized something when he watched Sadie battle.So it’s not that she has reached the realm of Minute Subtlety, but she’s relying on her Life Soul. What kind of Life Soul is that? It actually allows her to possess the ability of Minute Subtlety? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Sadie was fighting many alone. Although she was in a sorry state, she wasn’t injured from the gank. This was quite shocking.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, with so many Tiger Cage Demonized Generals surrounding her, Sadie couldn’t rush out of the encirclement. Her Essence Energy and stamina were very limited, so it was only a matter of time before she died.</p>
<p>This proves that no matter how strong one’s ability is, it’s best to be careful. In such a world, who knows what kind of enemy one will encounter? Once restrained, no matter how strong one’s ability is, one won’t be able to deny death. However, Sadie’s ability isn’t bad. If I can obtain her Essence Energy Art, I wonder if I can use the Lost Immortal Sutra to condense the same Life Soul? Zhou Wen was just musing for a moment. Even if he had the same Essence Energy Art, he might not necessarily be able to condense the same Life Soul. The formation of a Life Soul was determined by a person’s physique and mental strength. Therefore, everyone’s Life Soul was somewhat different. There weren’t two absolutely identical Life Souls.</p>
<p>It was the same for a Life Providence. The functions might be similar, but not completely identical.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even with the Lost Immortal Sutra, condensing a Life Soul wasn’t easy. One needed a special energy with similar attributes as a foundation. Only then could the Lost Immortal Sutra simulate condensing a Life Soul.</p>
<p>Now that I’m thinking about it, my First Order of Chaos hasn’t condensed a Life Soul. I wonder if I can use a drop of Grim Demon’s blood as a foundation to condense a Life Soul? Zhou Wen set his sights on Grim Demon.</p>
<p>With Demonic Neonate as his master, he probably wouldn’t dare to object to having him release some blood.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was considering how to condense the Life Soul of the First Order of Chaos with the blood of Grim Demon, Sadie was struggling to remain safe.</p>
<p>She originally imagined that a dimensional zone like Tiger Cage Pass couldn’t have Mythical creatures. With her Eye of Odin Life Soul, it wasn’t difficult to kill Epic dimensional creatures. Even if she couldn’t beat them, she had a chance of escaping.</p>
<p>Who knew that she would encounter a terrifying existence like the Elegant Emperor’s Avatar Puppet. She didn’t even have a chance to escape.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched from outside the city. She knew that Zhou Wen definitely had the ability to help her escape, but her pride prevented her from asking him. All she could do was summon her Companion Beasts and desperately attempt to rush out of the city.</p>
<p>It wasn’t easy for her to kill a Tiger Cage Demonized General and find a gap, but before she could rush out, she saw the Elegant Emperor’s Avatar Puppet throw out another stack of yellow paper. Instantly, more than ten Tiger Cage Demonized Generals landed. Not only did they seal off the way out, but they also made her situation worse.</p>
<p>Sadie immediately fell into despair. She was surrounded by twenty to thirty Tiger Cage Demonized Generals. Even if her Eye of Odin could see the path needed to get out, her body couldn’t keep up.</p>
<p>The reason the six families didn’t let young people use Mythical Companion Beasts was because of this principle. Young people were hot-blooded, especially young geniuses. They were all arrogant and impulsive. Having powerful strength only made it easier for them to fall into danger.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if they had Mythical Companion Beasts, the various families would give them to people who had some experience and had been burnished by reality. They were calm and capable.</p>
<p>Although they were about the same age, Lance would definitely not make such a decision if he were here.</p>
<p>Sadie’s Essence Energy was almost depleted. A Companion Beast beside her was attacked and ended up slamming into her. Immediately, her trajectory deviated. It was too late to dodge the attacks of the Tiger Cage Demonized Generals.</p>
<p>Sadie gritted her teeth and prepared to risk her life. However, she suddenly saw a flash of saber light. The Tiger Cage Demonized Generals beside her suddenly stopped their attacks. With a poof, white mist emitted from them as they transformed into yellow paper figurines that landed on the ground.</p>
<p>She turned her head and saw Zhou Wen standing beside the masked man. As for the masked man, his head had been chopped off.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked to Sadie’s side and asked, “What’s the secret regarding the Companion Beast ranking you mentioned?”</p>
<p>Sadie looked at Zhou Wen with a complicated expression before saying, “Actually, this isn’t really a secret. There should be quite a number of people in the six families who know about it. In fact, obtaining first place on the rankings isn’t the only way to get benefits.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? Isn’t the one coming in first place qualified to pluck the divine fruit?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“Picking the divine fruit is indeed something first place qualifies for. However, it’s still unknown if one can really pluck it. However, as long as one can enter the ranking, they’ll be able to obtain the corresponding benefits. It doesn’t matter if the ranking is high. Although, if it is high, there are more benefits,” said Sadie.</p>
<p>“What benefits?” Zhou Wen had never heard of such a thing.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure yet. I’ll only know what benefits we can obtain after the ranking battle ends,” Sadie said.</p>
<p>“Where did this news come from?” Zhou Wen frowned slightly. Sadie’s words seemed unbelievable.</p>
<p>The ranking had not long appeared, and it was unprecedented. Even if there was really a reward after the ranking battle, how did the six families know of that?</p>
<p>“I’m not sure about the source of the news, but it shouldn’t be wrong. For the six families and overseas factions to be so eager in rushing up the rankings, it’s definitely not without reason,” Sadie said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if Sadie really didn’t know or if she was just unwilling to say.</p>
<p>“It’s about time. Let’s head back.” Zhou Wen didn’t ask further.</p>
<p>Sadie walked back with Zhou Wen, but her emotions were mixed. Although she was confident that her acumen was better than Zhou Wen’s, the difference in combat experience was just too great. No matter how good her acumen was, it was useless. It was no different from having psychomotor problems. She felt that there was no need to challenge Zhou Wen again.</p>
<p>An opponent she had no way to fend against was easily killed by Zhou Wen. In front of absolute strength, the effects of her acumen were too minute.</p>
<p>I have to become stronger than him. Sadie cursed inwardly as she stared at Zhou Wen’s back.</p>
<p>Could it be that The Thearch is secretly up to no good? Zhou Wen didn’t care what Sadie was thinking. His mind was on the rankings.</p>
<p>Back then, it was The Thearch who had allowed John to obtain the six-winged seraphim Guardian. It wouldn’t be surprising if she had spread the news of the ranking.</p>
<p>There’s also a possibility that it’s Teacher Wang Mingyuan. The news might have come from his side as well. Zhou Wen felt that the possibility wasn’t small.</p>
<p>There were many experts in the Federation who entered the dimensional zones after a mutation. No one knew if there were any people that the Federation had deliberately planted among them.</p>
<p>If there was, it was not impossible to get news from them.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I have to go back and ask The Thearch. Zhou Wen decided to take the opportunity of delivering items to The Thearch to ask about the ranking.</p>
<h3 id='chapter616'>Chapter 616 Let Out Some Blood</h3>
<p>After the Xuanwen Club’s event ended, Zhou Wen returned to his dorm and sent a message to The Thearch. He informed her that the items were ready for her to receive.“Send them over.” The Thearch replied.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sent the items through the portal through the Void Flower. Although they weren’t worth much, he had still spent more than 100,000. It made his heart ache slightly.</p>
<p>“The Thearch, you previously said that only the first Companion Beast on the rankings has benefits. Then, what other benefits does first place have in the future?” Zhou Wen probed.</p>
<p>“Why are you asking? Your Companion Beast isn’t capable of ranking first. It’s useless even if you know,” The Thearch replied.</p>
<p>“Even if I can’t obtain first place, I can still try my best to vie for a higher ranking. Will the other rankings benefit me?” Zhou Wen could tell from The Thearch’s tone that it might really be as Sadie had said.</p>
<p>“Yes, but if you can’t enter the top ten, the benefits are very limited. Your Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s Wheel of Destiny is virtually useless in the pet battle. From the looks of the Companion Beasts on the rankings, it’s not bad if it can eventually reach the top thirty. The one on your ear isn’t even at the Mythical stage. It’s impossible for it to enter the top hundred.”</p>
<p>Can’t I have other Companion Beasts? Zhou Wen said that inwardly without sending it to The Thearch. He didn’t wish to expose his true strength in front of The Thearch.</p>
<p>“The Thearch, what benefits will there be for getting on the rankings?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“Do you want to know?” The Thearch’s message came quickly. Unfortunately, it wasn’t an answer.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“All the more reason why I won’t tell you.” The Thearch even sent a smug expression after the message.</p>
<p>Helpless, Zhou Wen had no choice but to remain silent.</p>
<p>However, he was certain that there was definitely some benefit to being able to enter the rankings. However, if the ranking was too low, the benefits wouldn’t be great.</p>
<p>Just as The Thearch said, the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon isn’t suitable for a one-on-one battle. Its ranking definitely won’t be high. Which Companion Beast should I use to give it a try? Zhou Wen was momentarily hesitant.</p>
<p>To get on the rankings, one definitely needed to fight. In a battle, one would expose the strength of their Companion Beasts, giving others a chance to figure out a way to restrain them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was now thinking about which Companion Beast to expose, one that wouldn’t affect him much in the future.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to make a decision. There was still plenty of time, so he didn’t need to hurry. Furthermore, the rules of the rankings were that one could only challenge high-ranking ones, not the other way round. Zhou Wen didn’t plan on challenging Primordial Sword Immortal from the beginning.</p>
<p>I have to ask An Sheng first if the Companion Beasts from the Special Inspector Bureau and Cape family are on the rankings. I’ll start with them. Zhou Wen planned on catching them by surprise. He planned on killing their Companion Beasts on the rankings before personally settling scores with them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sent a message to An Sheng, but An Sheng didn’t reply. He did not know what he was busy with.</p>
<p>Forget it. I’ll give it a try and see if I can use Grim Demon’s blood to advance the First Order of Chaos. Zhou Wen summoned Demonic Neonate out.</p>
<p>“Little Neonate, get Grim Demon out. I need him to do something,” Zhou Wen said to Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate remained silent as she summoned Grim Demon from the ancient sword.</p>
<p>After Grim Demon came out, his entire body was like a black demonic aura. He had an anthropomorphic look, but his looks were indiscernible.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen placed a washbasin in front of Grim Demon and said, “I need some of your blood. I don’t need too much. Just half a basin would do.”</p>
<p>Grim Demon’s expression instantly darkened. Thankfully, his body was covered in the black demonic aura, so no expression could be seen.</p>
<p>“No way.” Grim Demon gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>“Little Neonate.” Zhou Wen looked at Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate turned to look at Grim Demon and glared at him.</p>
<p>Grim Demon immediately cowered. He gritted his teeth and said to Zhou Wen, “Our Guardian’s blood is our life essence. It’s impossible for me to give you that much. At most, I can only give you one drop.”</p>
<p>“One hundred drops.” Zhou Wen bargained.</p>
<p>“Two drops. It really can’t be more.” Grim Demon’s voice was trembling as though he was trying his best to suppress the anger in his heart.</p>
<p>“Ninety-nine drops. Not any less,” Zhou Wen said without changing his expression.</p>
<p>After a final round of negotiation, Grim Demon refused to add any more beyond five drops. No matter how threatening Zhou Wen was, it was useless.</p>
<p>“Five drops? So be it then. Produce it.” Zhou Wen felt that Grim Demon was already desperate enough to risk his life in defiance, so he didn’t continue forcing him. If it was really useful, one drop would be enough. Five drops would be more than enough.</p>
<p>Grim Demon reluctantly extended his finger. Five drops of black liquid that resembled ink flew out and floated in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out and had the five drops of Grim Demon’s blood float over his hand. Then, he said to Demonic Neonate, “Alright, store him away.”</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate extended the ancient sword in her arms. Grim Demon could only obediently possess the ancient sword.</p>
<p>“Good girl. Go play with Banana Fairy.” Zhou Wen patted Demonic Neonate’s head and carried the five drops of Grim Demon’s blood into the training room.</p>
<p>He circulated the First Order of Chaos in an attempt to absorb the five drops of Grim Demon’s blood, but the First Order of Chaos seemed to reject it. He failed to absorb it.</p>
<p>Can’t I absorb it? Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed. This proved that their stats were incompatible. Even if he could barely absorb the five drops of Grim Demon’s blood, it wouldn’t be of much use.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me that I really need the blood of the Guardian in Ant City? Zhou Wen frowned as he looked at the five drops of Grim Demon’s blood.</p>
<p>He felt that the five drops of blood couldn’t be wasted. Zhou Wen switched to the other Essence Energy Arts, hoping to see if he could fuse them with Grim Demon’s blood.</p>
<p>In the end, even though there were strong and weak rejections, they were all incompatible.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was feeling depressed, he suddenly felt a burning sensation in his ears.</p>
<p>Could it be that Truth Listener is about to hatch? Zhou Wen summoned Truth Listener and saw that it was still in its Companion Egg form and hadn’t hatched.</p>
<p>However, the moment Truth Listener came out, the five drops of Grim Demon blood were sucked away by it. The five drops of blood fused into the golden crystal-like Companion Egg, dyeing the flawless golden color with five black impurities.</p>
<p>Isn’t Truth Listener a Buddhist divine beast? Why does it need demonic blood? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he looked at the Companion Egg that had absorbed the demonic blood.</p>
<p>After Truth Listener’s Companion Egg absorbed the demonic blood, the demonic blood’s black colors gradually spread inside the Companion Egg. It was as though a jar of water had been thrown into the ink. The ink gradually spread out in the clear water and quickly dyed the entire Companion Egg black.</p>
<h3 id='chapter617'>Chapter 617 Nirvana of Ultimate Hell</h3>
<p>After turning into a black Companion Egg, there were still strange changes happening inside.A golden light spread out from the middle of the Companion Egg. When the black light touched the golden light, it rapidly faded. In a blink of an eye, the black color vanished completely. The entire Companion Egg turned golden again.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, the golden color seemed to gain some thickness and weight. The Companion Egg gradually turned from transparent to gold.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>Cracks appeared on the Companion Egg as it rapidly spread across the golden-like Companion Egg. Then, it peeled off bit by bit. The falling fragments turned into golden sand in the air. When it landed on the ground, it turned into black demonic gas that dissipated.</p>
<p>A golden beast jumped out of the Companion Egg. It looked no different from Truth Listener from the past. Its body was small and its fur was dark-gold. Its six ears were wearing six golden hoops, and its eyes seemed to contain golden lightning.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his palm and Truth Listener jumped onto it. Zhou Wen held it in front of his eyes and carefully observed it. Apart from the six earrings, it was indeed no different from before. All he could do was use his phone to look at its stats.</p>
<p>Truth Listener: Mythical (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Heaven’s Senses</p>
<p>Life Soul: Evil Nullification</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Nirvana of Ultimate Hell</p>
<p>Strength: 81</p>
<p>Speed: 81</p>
<p>Constitution: 81</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 81</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Truth Listener, Indestructible Vajra Body, Evil Warding, Nine Extremes</p>
<p>Companion Form: Earring</p>
<p>With stats at 81, it was a top-notch Mythical Companion Beast. Its Life Providence, Life Soul, and Essence Energy Skills hadn’t changed. The only addition was the Mythical Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the name sounds very powerful. I wonder what use it has? It can’t be that it’s just a supplementary ability, right? Zhou Wen put Truth Listener away and entered the game. He wanted to try out Truth Listener’s abilities in-game.</p>
<p>Looking at the time, Medusa was about to respawn. Zhou Wen opened the Curse Demon Palace instance dungeon and got Truth Listener to lead as he stormed his way in.</p>
<p>The stone statues were naturally not Truth Listener’s match. A casual swipe of its claw shattered them into pieces.</p>
<p>However, what was strange was that even after advancing to the Mythical stage, Truth Listener didn’t seem to have the ability to release its powers. It still needed to directly touch its opponent to deal damage.</p>
<p>However, because of Truth Listener’s high speed and strength, it was almost impossible to see its actions clearly. The group of stone statues shattered and turned into rubble.</p>
<p>They rushed all the way to the palace where Medusa was. After opening the palace, the beautiful girl became the demoness, Medusa.</p>
<p>“Truth Listener, it’s time to showcase your strength. Go, let me see how strong your Wheel of Destiny is.” Zhou Wen ordered Truth Listener to use its Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen gave the order, one of the six golden hoops on Truth Listener’s ear shattered and fell. The fragments disintegrated into golden sand in the air before dissipating into a demonic gas.</p>
<p>As the golden hoop shattered, a terrifying demonic aura erupted from Truth Listener’s dark golden body. It caused its body to expand with the demonic aura and undergo some strange changes.</p>
<p>In a short period of time, its petite body turned into a huge beast that was several meters tall. Its dark-gold fur also turned into scales like a terrifying giant ape covered in dark-gold scales. Its body also emitted a strange demonic aura, one completely different from the demonic aura of Grim Demon. It felt more evil.</p>
<p>Medusa had already used the Eyes of Petrification to look at Truth Listener, but when the beam of the Eyes of Petrification swept across Truth Listener’s body, it was useless. It was unable to petrify its body.</p>
<p>However, Truth Listener’s body violently tore through space and instantly arrived in front of Medusa. Its claws grabbed Medusa’s head, its dark-gold claws stabbing into it.</p>
<p>In the next second, Zhou Wen saw an extremely brutal scene. Truth Listener’s claws tore the demoness’s body into two as demonic blood flowed everywhere.</p>
<p>Roar! After throwing the corpse to the ground, Truth Listener roared at the sky as though it was venting its violent desires.</p>
<p>“Come back.” Zhou Wen summoned Truth Listener back. This was because he felt that Truth Listener’s emotions were extremely unstable, showing signs of losing control.</p>
<p>The ruthless Truth Listener received Zhou Wen’s order and leaped towards the blood-colored avatar. Its monster-like body shrank in midair as a golden earring condensed out of thin air and clipped onto its ear. By the time Truth Listener reached the blood-colored avatar’s ear, it had already returned to its original size. There was a golden earring on each of its six ears.</p>
<p>The violent emotions from before vanished as well. It landed on the blood-colored avatar’s ear, turning into a tiny dark-gold earring that hung from its earlobe.</p>
<p>Was that Truth Listener’s Wheel of Destiny? Why is it so irritable when the Wheel of Destiny is activated? It has six earrings on its ears, and only one of them shattered. If the other five shatter as well, will there be different changes? Zhou Wen wanted to give it a try, but when he thought of Truth Listener’s ferocious and ruthless appearance, he temporarily gave up on that thought.</p>
<p>As Truth Listener’s master, he could sense Truth Listener’s thoughts. Just now, Truth Listener’s emotions were extremely unstable. If it became more violent, Zhou Wen didn’t know if it would still obey his orders.</p>
<p>What’s wrong with this fellow? Zhou Wen frowned inwardly.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth was famous for being a ferocious beast, but it wasn’t as irascible as Truth Listener.</p>
<p>As for Truth Listener, it was an auspicious beast according to legend. After its Wheel of Destiny was activated, it was truly puzzling why it had become so violent.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen went online to search for mythical information regarding Truth Listeners. Although there were many different versions, Truth Listener was a kind-hearted divine beast in many of the versions.</p>
<p>There were two popular versions. One of them was that Truth Listener was a white dog. It followed Ksitigarbha’s incarnation and was born in the mortal world. After Ksitigarbha’s incarnation died, it loyally protected the corpse, unwilling to leave even if it had to die. Finally, it became a divine beast.</p>
<p>The four Bodhisattvas’ mounts each represented a trait. Truth Listeners represented loyalty.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s Truth Listener wasn’t in the form of a white dog. It wasn’t the traditional look that had the features of nine different beasts, but more like a snub-nosed monkey.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen felt that his Truth Listener was unlikely to match Truth Listener’s first legend.</p>
<p>There was also a second version of the legend. In the second myth, Truth Listener was a hellspawn born in hell. It was born in the deepest depths of hell and had the responsibility to guard hell.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was more inclined towards this version’s Mythical legend, but even so, Truth Listener, who presided over hell, should be a kind divine beast. Why was it so violent?</p>
<p>Could it be that the six golden hoops or Grim Demon’s blood caused Truth Listener to have a problem? Or could it be that Truth Listener was originally like that? Zhou Wen couldn’t confirm the reason as he searched for more information to no avail.</p>
<h3 id='chapter618'>Chapter 618 Chimera</h3>
<p>Thankfully, Truth Listener was fine as long as it didn’t use the Wheel of Destiny. Zhou Wen tried it a few times. Even if it used the Nirvana of Ultimate Hell, it would only shatter one earring every time, turning it extremely violent like a ferocious hellspawn.However, Truth Listener would still carry out Zhou Wen’s orders completely. Only its unstable emotions worried Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Having activated the Wheel of Destiny, Truth Listener was extremely powerful in combat. It was able to fight Qiongqi head-on without being at a disadvantage. Qiongqi’s attacks couldn’t harm its body. It could only use its speed to circle around Truth Listener. Truth Listener’s speed wasn’t slow either. In the end, Qiongqi was killed.</p>
<p>However, this was only if it activated the Wheel of Destiny. Although Truth Listener wouldn’t end up killed without it, it wasn’t Qiongqi’s match.</p>
<p>Due to Truth Listener’s potent Indestructible Vajra Body, it was only slightly injured at most. Even the Eyes of Petrification that Medusa released at full strength was useless against it. Apart from Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World, there was no other power that could directly kill it.</p>
<p>Since he couldn’t find any problems, Zhou Wen stopped thinking about it. After careful consideration, he decided to try his best not to let Truth Listener use its Wheel of Destiny. Most of the time, it would appear in the form of an earring as a companion form.</p>
<p>After advancing to the Mythical stage, Truth Listener’s listening ability became even more impressive. Not only was it extensive, but it could also hear weaker movements.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t know what the principle was, Truth Listener could actually hear colors now. Just this alone made it much stronger than before.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“You want to snipe the bureau and Capes’ Mythical Companion Beasts on the rankings?” An Sheng didn’t reply, but he personally came to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Zhou Wen answered cleanly.</p>
<p>“If you want to use Torch Dragon or Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, I suggest that you don’t do so. You’ve already exposed the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon too many times, so it’s very easy to find out that it belongs to you. Torch Dragon only exists in the Zhuolu battlefield. Now, only we are the ones studying the temples under the Zhuolu battlefield. It’s very easy to deduce who Torch Dragon’s master is. Although you are already very strong, it’s best if you don’t fall out with the six families now,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“I understand. I still have a Companion Beast that no one has seen before. I usually don’t use it. Now, I plan on letting it snipe the Capes and the bureau’s Companion Beasts,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That would work, but there aren’t many Mythical Companion Beasts from the bureau. They aren’t on the rankings either. If you insist on taking action, you can only start with the Capes. This is the information on the three Companion Beasts that the Cape family has listed. These three are confirmed to be theirs. The others aren’t confirmed. It’s best you don’t kill them randomly. After all, these Mythical Companion Beasts are the foundation of the Federation. It would be a pity if they were destroyed.” An Sheng’s words were actually reminding Zhou Wen not to cause too much trouble.</p>
<p>The Federation’s situation was very bad. In the future, after the seal over the dimensional zones were broken, they would still need these Mythical Companion Beasts to fight to protect humans.</p>
<p>They were not only the Cape family’s private property, but also the Federation’s future hope.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I know what to do.” Zhou Wen didn’t plan on wantonly killing, but he definitely had to settle the scores with the Cape family and the bureau.</p>
<p>Out of the Mythical Companion Beasts that could be confirmed to be the Cape family’s, one of them was ranked 91st—Inferno Dragon, while the other was ranked 63rd—Sprite King of Thunder. It was ranked even lower than Zhou Wen’s Six-Winged Guardian Dragon.</p>
<p>Although killing them would make the Cape family feel the pinch, alarming them would make them wary. It was impossible for Zhou Wen to have another chance.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen set his sights on the top-ranked Chimera in the Cape family. It was ranked thirteenth.</p>
<p>Chimera’s appearance was very strange. It had a lion’s body, a snake as a tail, and a pair of bat wings.</p>
<p>It also had three heads. One was like a lion, the other was like a goat, and the other was like a single-horned dragon.</p>
<p>Up to now, no other Companion Beast had challenged Chimera, so any understanding of it was limited to its past combat achievements.</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, an evil dragon broke out of the seal and wreaked havoc in the Federation’s coastal cities. It was the territory of the Cape family, so the Cape family mobilized Chimera to kill the evil dragon in that battle.</p>
<p>Legend had it that the dragon had left behind a Companion Egg. It was the Inferno Dragon that had been listed.</p>
<p>According to the information that leaked back then, Chimera had many attributes. Poison and flames were already proven abilities. There were also some other abilities that had not been confirmed. Most of them were just guesses.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen finished reading the few pieces of information on Chimera, he decided to start with it. He needed to strike at it in one fell swoop. As long as the Cape family dared to accept the challenge, they wouldn’t even have the chance to admit defeat.</p>
<p>I’ll send Tyrant Behemoth. This fellow is clearly a Companion Beast from the West District. It’s difficult for others to suspect me, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know that although Tyrant Behemoth was a dimensional creature in the West District, the Companion Egg was obtained by the Zhang family. Few people knew about this, but the Zhang family had lost the Tyrant Behemoth Companion Egg. They had been searching for it.</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng, is there a way to prevent others from seeing my Companion Beast in the arena?” Zhou Wen was extremely vexed about this point.</p>
<p>This was because all the major media outlets had set up fixed cameras around the cube. The black cube had been tightly surrounded and was constantly being filmed 24/7. If he were to bring Tyrant Behemoth over to start the battle, he would definitely be captured by the cameras.</p>
<p>If Tyrant Behemoth appeared in Luoyang, it reduced the significance of sending it.</p>
<p>“You will definitely be captured by the cameras if you go to the cubes in the various cities.” An Sheng thought for a moment and said, “How about this? You are already very familiar with the roads around White Cloud Mountain and Mount Laojun. In a 400-kilometer-radius, there’s an ancient town. There’s also a cube in the ancient town. As it’s too remote and there are plenty of dimensional zones around it, there’s no one living there. Very few people will pass by. I’ll draw a map for you. Go there.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was overjoyed. After getting the map, he packed his things and headed for the ancient town.</p>
<p>Mount Laojun and White Cloud Mountain were both part of the Funiu Mountain Range. Zhou Wen was indeed very familiar with the roads here. Alone in the mountain range, he had many Mythical creatures protecting him, so there wasn’t much danger.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen still avoided the known dimensional zones to prevent himself from falling into unknown danger.</p>
<p>He arrived at the ancient town An Sheng mentioned without any mishaps. Indeed, this place had become a ghost town. Many of the houses in the town had collapsed, and many buildings were covered in green plants.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked into the town and walked along the stone path. This had probably been a tourist attraction in the past. Although the town wasn’t big, the architecture was pretty good. Unfortunately, it was already abandoned.</p>
<p>As it was surrounded by mountains on three sides, it got dark rather early. When Zhou Wen walked through the town, the sky was already dark.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen saw a small shop with its lights on in front of him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter619'>Chapter 619 Genie“s Master</h3>
<p>There’s actually someone here? But even if someone lives here, the power supply in the town should have been cut off. How can there be light? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he carefully approached the shop at the corner of the street.The shop was a minimart. Quite a number of the LED lights on the shop sign were not working. A small portion of them was still lit. In such an environment, it looked a little strange.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Truth Listener’s hearing abilities. Although he was still very far away, the situation in the minimart had already projected itself in his mind. It was like a holographic projection that allowed him to see everything clearly. It even had color.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen saw a young man sitting on a wooden rocking chair in the minimart with his eyes closed.</p>
<p>On the wooden table beside the rocking chair was a mess of snacks and a few opened cans of beer.</p>
<p>The youth rocked in the chair as he closed his eyes in enjoyment. He gulped down beer and occasionally threw a few snacks into his mouth. He looked rather pleased.</p>
<p>And on the counter beside him was an oil lamp. The style of the oil lamp was very similar to that of the Saga of Heroes oil lamp. It was obvious that it wasn’t from the East District.</p>
<p>The oil lamp’s flames shone with white light. Strangely, in the white light, the lights in the minimart lit up. There was also a fan that was spinning.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had just taken a look when the oil lamp’s flame suddenly expanded. Instantly, white light surged, immediately disabling the effectiveness of Truth Listener’s ability. It couldn’t hear the situation in the minimart.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed as he looked at the minimart. He saw that the youth had already walked out and was looking at him.</p>
<p>Beside the youth, the oil lamp floated in the air. As for the flame, it had already turned into what looked like a deity. It was somewhat similar to the mythical Aladdin’s magic lamp.</p>
<p>When the youth saw Zhou Wen, his expression seemed odd. He stood there and sized him up as though he was very curious about him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also sized up the youth. He looked 27 or 28 years old. He wasn’t handsome, but he was very stylish. He was the type that was filled with manly charm.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was certain that he had never seen him before as he looked rather unfamiliar.</p>
<p>As for the lamp beside him, Zhou Wen recognized it. It was Genie which was on the ranking. It had once been ranked third, but it had now fallen to ninth place. It was still quite a respectable ranking.</p>
<p>“Please don’t misunderstand. I don’t have any ill intentions. I just happened to pass by and saw some light, so I came over out of curiosity,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>The youth curled his lips and laughed. “It’s fate that we meet. Apart from us, there’s no one else here. Why don’t you come in and have a drink with me? It will save us the loneliness of the night.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your kindness. I still have something to do. I’ll continue on my way. I won’t disturb you any further.” Zhou Wen felt that the youth was somewhat odd, so he decided to stay away from him.</p>
<p>To his surprise, the youth said with a smile, “There are mountains surrounding three sides of this area. Apart from the path you took to enter, there’s no other way out. And in such a sh*thole, the only useful thing is probably the black cube in the town square. I’m afraid you are like me. You don’t want others to see your Companion Beast on the rankings, right?”</p>
<p>The youth’s guess was naturally correct. Although Zhou Wen wanted to deny it, he couldn’t find a reasonable excuse.</p>
<p>“Now that you’ve seen my Genie, even if I know that your Companion Beast is on the rankings, you and I have something against each other. No one will be at a disadvantage. I’ve been here for many days and haven’t even seen a fly. I’m really bored. Just stay here and chat with me,” said the youth with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t move. Since he had been discovered, he decided not to let Tyrant Behemoth fight here.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to bid farewell and leave, the youth continued, “It doesn’t matter if you don’t want to stay. However, you already know my secret, and I don’t have anything to use against you. It’s naturally impossible for me to let you leave alive.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, the Genie beside the youth had already arrived in front of him. It stared at Zhou Wen and took a deep breath. The body condensed from the flame instantly doubled in size as though a flaming vortex was flowing inside.</p>
<p>“Do you want to fight my Genie or stay behind to drink with me? Make a choice.” The youth leaned against the door frame and took another sip before looking at Zhou Wen with a smile.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.” Zhou Wen turned around and left.</p>
<p>The youth didn’t have any intention of taking action. He only said indifferently, “You know that my Companion Beast is Genie, but you aren’t moved at all. Yet, you came to this godforsaken place to make it onto the rankings. The Companion Beasts you possess are definitely extraordinary. At the very least, they are higher than my Genie. Even if you aren’t on the rankings, I can guess that any new top Companion Beast that appears on the ranking will be yours.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t stop as he continued walking.</p>
<p>The youth’s voice continued, “Your name is Zhou Wen, right? Everyone in the bureau has a photo of you.”</p>
<p>“You’re from the bureau?” Zhou Wen turned to look at the youth. If the youth was really a member of the bureau, he could use all means to kill him, despite not liking the idea of murder.</p>
<p>“Don’t misunderstand. I have nothing to do with the bureau.” The youth shrugged nonchalantly and said, “I’m the same as you. I’m a target of the bureau’s pursuit. I’ve seen your photo in the hands of the bureau’s people and some information. That’s why I recognize you.”</p>
<p>“You came here to attempt getting into the rankings and have a powerful Companion Beast. I’m guessing you are planning on doing something. However, the bureau doesn’t seem to have any Mythical Companion Beasts on the rankings. I remember now. You have quite a deep grudge with the Cape family. Are you trying to challenge the Capes’ Companion Beasts on the rankings?”</p>
<p>The youth thought for a moment and laughed. “Chimera… You want to challenge Chimera, right?”</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Zhou Wen frowned as he looked at the youth. He hadn’t said a thing, but the youth had already guessed so much. It was as though he had read his mind. It left Zhou Wen somewhat alarmed.</p>
<p>“Uncrying Night. First on the bureau’s wanted list, and my bounty is the highest. Have you heard of me?” The youth drank another mouthful of beer before continuing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know who was ranked first on the bureau’s wanted list, but the youth did indeed make him wary.</p>
<p>“I already know your secret. Unless you kill me or give up on your plan, it doesn’t matter where you get to on the rankings. Why don’t you stay and have a few drinks with me? That way, you won’t be alone in this remote mountain range.” The youth threw a can of beer at Zhou Wen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter620'>Chapter 620 Strange Town</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen’s eyes focused as he slashed out with the Golden Overlord Sword in his hand. The golden sword beam instantly destroyed the beer as it shot towards Uncrying Night.The Genie in front of Uncrying Night spat out a blinding white flame. The golden sword beam struck the flame like a wheel, splitting it apart. At the same time, it split the Genie’s body into two and continued slashing at Uncrying Night.</p>
<p>A look of surprise flashed across Uncrying Night’s eyes as he quickly dodged the golden sword beam’s slash.</p>
<p>However, the sword wheel formed by the golden sword beam suddenly boomeranged and slashed at Uncrying Night’s back at an even faster speed. It was none other than the Boomerang Wind Essence Energy Skill.</p>
<p>Just as the golden sword wheel was about to touch Uncrying Night’s back, he suddenly used a strange stance. As he leaned forward, he spun his left leg as he dodged the golden sword wheel in a contorted fashion.</p>
<p>The Golden Overlord Sword in Zhou Wen’s hand wasn’t idle either. With Transcendent Flying Immortal activated, he fused with the sword beam as his body tore through the void and slashed at Uncrying Night like golden lightning.</p>
<p>Uncrying Night wore a solemn expression as black matter condensed on his hands. It transformed into bracers that wrapped around his arms and palms as he stared intently at the Golden Overlord Sword that flashed over.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Uncrying Night managed to sandwich the Golden Overlord Sword’s blade in the middle. However, the golden sword beam on the Golden Overlord Sword was too intense. It pushed Uncrying Night’s body back, causing him to slam into the building behind him, collapsing it.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Uncrying Night crashed through several buildings and finally slammed into the stone wall. The stone walls behind him were in ruins before he stopped retreating.</p>
<p>The Golden Overlord Sword’s blade was still firmly clamped between his hands. The black vortex produced by the bracers constantly absorbed the golden sword beam, but it was unable to completely absorb it. The sword beam sparks produced constantly exploded.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pushed the blade with all his might, slowly pressing the blade towards Uncrying Night. Just as the golden sword beam on the blade was about to touch his cheek, Uncrying Night pushed with both hands and ducked to the side. The Golden Overlord Sword left a deep mark on the mountain wall behind him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen brandished his sword and was about to slash again when Uncrying Night waved his hand. “Junior Brother, I’m joking with you. There’s no need to fight to the death!”</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhou Wen was completely unfazed, the Golden Overlord Sword in his hand slashed down again. Uncrying Night waved his hand as he retreated. “I’m really your senior brother. My name is Liu Yun and I’m Teacher Wang Mingyuan’s student. You should have heard of my name, right? I’m the same as you. I graduated from Guide High School. Speaking of which, we hail from the same hometown.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback when he heard that. He did remember that Wang Mingyuan had such a student, but he had long graduated. He was from a graduating class many years ago.</p>
<p>He had even discussed the senior brother named Liu Yun with Zhong Ziya. Furthermore, Liu Yun was rather famous in Guide City. He was publicly recognized as Guide City’s genius. Zhou Wen had heard of his name when he was there.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that your name was Uncrying Night? Why are you now Liu Yun?” Zhou Wen stared coldly at the youth. He didn’t lower his sword as he locked onto him.</p>
<p>“Uncrying Night is my nickname. My real name is Liu Yun.” As the youth spoke, he took out something. “You recognize this thing, right? I believe other than Teacher’s students, no one else will have it.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that the youth was holding a pendant. It looked like it was carved from ivory, but it was a little green, instead of the yellow tinge that ivory had.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be taken aback when he saw the pendant. He also had one. It was given to him by Wang Mingyuan and had once helped him tide through danger.</p>
<p>Later, he heard from Wang Mingyuan that the pendant had been carved from the teeth of the white dragon in Dragon’s Well. However, Wang Mingyuan said that he had carved four of them and gave them to Jiang Yan, Zhong Ziya, Hui Haifeng, and Zhou Wen respectively. He didn’t mention anything about Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to doubt it. When Teacher obtained the dragon teeth, I was the one who helped him steal them from beneath Dragon’s Well. Back then, Teacher carved a pendant for me and kept the rest. He said that he would give it to his favorite disciples in the future. I believe you must have one too, right?” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“How did you know I would be here?” Although Zhou Wen already believed that he was Wang Mingyuan’s student, he didn’t relax his guard.</p>
<p>Liu Yun spread out his hands and said, “How would I know that you would come here? I was pursued by the bureau and fled here to seek refuge. I didn’t expect to meet you. If it weren’t for the bureau’s constant hunting of the four of you, I wouldn’t have known that you were Teacher’s student.”</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, he suddenly heard hurried hooves coming from the north of the town. It was as though thousands of troops were charging towards the town.</p>
<p>“Oh no, I was caught up with pulling your leg and forgot about this matter. Quickly hide. Don’t reveal yourself or make a sound. Otherwise, there will be big trouble.” As Liu Yun spoke, he unsummoned Genie and charged forward. With a bound, he jumped into a water well by the side.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen leaped down with Liu Yun with the Golden Overlord Sword in hand.</p>
<p>Splash! Splash!</p>
<p>The duo fell into the well one after another. Liu Yun sank his body into the water, and Zhou Wen followed suit. They dived into the well together, but the Golden Overlord Sword in his hand maintained an offensive stance, guarding against Liu Yun.</p>
<p>As the hooves approached, Zhou Wen used his ears to listen to the situation outside. The projection outside immediately imprinted itself into his mind, allowing him to see a strange scene.</p>
<p>The ones running outside weren’t horses, but creatures that looked like deer. The deer were completely white, and there were crystal-like antlers on their heads. The herd of white deer numbered at least a hundred. Every one of them was abnormally majestic, and the crystal antlers on their heads were extremely large.</p>
<p>On the back of the majestic white deer in front of the herd was a strange creature. It wore white clothes, white trousers, and a white hat. It looked like a human, but its face was also white. It had no mouth, nose, eyes, nor eyebrows—like a piece of white paper.</p>
<p>The white deer carried the white-clothed man and ran through the streets, but they didn’t leave the town. Instead, they circled the streets.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Every time the herd of white deer walked a distance, the white-clothed man would strike the metal disc in his other hand with a rod. They did not know what he was doing.</p>
<p>After the white deer herd and the white-clothed faceless man circled the town, they sped away and left the town.</p>
<p>Only then did Liu Yun rush out of the well and chase after the white deer herd.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Zhou Wen jumped out of the well and asked Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“Flower picking,” Liu Yun answered before chasing in the direction that the white deer herd had disappeared.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and followed him out of town.</p>
<p>The white deer and the white-clothed man were dimensional creatures, but this town wasn’t a dimensional zone. It was indeed strange for them to appear here.</p>
<p>It was mainly because Zhou Wen was afraid that the fellow who claimed to be Liu Yun would escape. He still couldn’t confirm who he really was. Even if he was Liu Yun, Zhou Wen couldn’t let him spread the news of him coming here.</p>
<p>621 Treasure Snatching in the Lake</p>
<p>The town was surrounded by mountains on three sides, and the direction the white deer herd came from was not the entrance, but the depths of the basin.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen caught up to Liu Yun outside the town, Liu Yun gestured for him to remain silent before stealthily approaching.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed behind him to see what he was up to.</p>
<p>Liu Yun seemed to be very familiar with the path here. He drilled through the forest and grasslands, and soon, he hid in a bush.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also entered the grassland and realized that there was a lake beyond it. The lake wasn’t very big, and surrounding it was the large grassland and a small portion of a forest.</p>
<p>The white deer herd was on the grass beside the lake. The bright moonlight shone on the grass and the lake, blanketing them with a layer of light. It looked exceptionally beautiful, like an immortal paradise in the mortal world.</p>
<p>Most of the white deer had their heads lowered as they leisurely ate the grass. Only the leading white deer was standing straight on the bank. The white-clothed man was also staring at the lake.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t have eyes, he gave off the feeling that he was staring intently at the center of the lake.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>After a while, the white-clothed man used the rod in his hand to strike the metal disc. With that, the grass-eating white deer raised their heads and approached the leading white deer.</p>
<p>The leading white deer walked towards the lake. Magically, it slowly walked over the water. It didn’t sink into the water. Ripples spread under its hooves. Under the moonlight, it was like a ring of light spreading across the water surface.</p>
<p>The white deer behind followed. They stepped on the water surface and followed the leader to the center of the lake.</p>
<p>When the white deer came to a halt, the white-clothed, faceless man’s rod struck at an even higher frequency. He kept striking the metal disc, producing clanging noises.</p>
<p>Amidst the rapid clanging, the white deer herd became uneasy.</p>
<p>It was unknown what kind of power was driving the white deer. One of the white deer raised its head and used its antlers to slam into the white deer beside it.</p>
<p>The crystal-like antlers immediately tore through the other white deer’s stomach and blood gushed out like a fountain.</p>
<p>It was as if the curtain had been drawn. The entire herd became irascible, constantly killing each other on the surface of the lake. The deer’s blood dyed the lake red in a moment, and the dead white deer’s corpses sank into the water.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat curious when he saw this strange scene. He wanted to know what the white-clothed man was doing.</p>
<p>More and more white deer died and sank to the bottom of the lake. Soon, only the leading white deer from the original hundred remained standing on the surface of the lake.</p>
<p>As for the originally crystal-clear lake, it had already been dyed purplish-red by the white deer’s blood. It was like a huge blood-red gem that emitted a rich smell of blood.</p>
<p>Bloop! Bloop!</p>
<p>In the middle of the lake, tiny bubbles surfaced. It was as if the lake had been boiled, but the temperature of the lake didn’t rise.</p>
<p>After a while, Zhou Wen heard a splashing sound. Then, he saw a white flower tear out of the water and float to the surface.</p>
<p>The flower had six petals, blooming in a hexagonal shape, they were as white as snow. There was a circular petal in the middle, but it was bright red like blood. It looked like a Sacred Lily, but its flower pistel’s diameter exceeded a meter.</p>
<p>As the flower appeared, the purplish-red color of the lake water gradually faded. As for the snow-white petals, they gradually turned red as though the petals had absorbed the blood in the lake.</p>
<p>In just twenty minutes, the lake water returned to its crystal-clear state. The huge flower had completely turned blood-red, like a beautiful blood rose.</p>
<p>The white-clothed, faceless man waved his hand and used it like a blade, slicing off the white deer’s head he was riding. Blood spewed out from the white deer’s severed neck like a fountain. It splashed onto the flower, making it even more beautiful.</p>
<p>The deer’s corpse sank into the water, but the white-clothed figure didn’t react at all. He stood on the surface of the water with a face without any facial features. He continued facing the blood flower as though he was staring at it.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the white-clothed man’s target should be that flower. What’s the use of that flower? Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, he saw a red glow shoot out from the flower. It was as though something was shimmering in the petal.</p>
<p>The white-clothed man, who had been standing there motionless the entire time, finally moved. He extended a hand and grabbed the center petal.</p>
<p>Liu Yun, who was lurking beside Zhou Wen, suddenly charged forward like a stream of light towards the flower. At the same time, he threw the oil lamp in his hand at the white-clothed, faceless man.</p>
<p>The oil lamp spewed out flames in the air, turning into a deity-like Genie. It spewed out flames that resembled a tornado towards the white-clothed, faceless man.</p>
<p>While the flames entangled the faceless man in white, Liu Yun reached out to grab the petal.</p>
<p>The white-clothed, faceless man waved his sleeve and immediately extinguished all the flames that the Genie spewed out. At the same time, the white wooden stick in his other hand struck at Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Liu Yun blocked the wooden stick with one hand while his other hand continued its attempt at grabbing the flower. Unfortunately, it was blocked by a metal disc.</p>
<p>In an instant, Liu Yun and the white-clothed, faceless man clashed several times. Liu Yun’s hands were extremely fast, leaving behind afterimages when he attacked. It was as though he had transformed into a Thousand-Hand Guanyin. His speed wasn’t inferior to Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal. It was no wonder he could grab the Golden Overlord Sword with both hands.</p>
<p>However, the white-clothed man was even faster. As he blocked Liu Yun, he struck the metal disc with the wooden staff.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, who was by the riverbank, immediately felt his mind explode when he heard the sound. His soul seemed to waver from the tremors as though it would fly out of his body at any moment. He couldn’t help but be alarmed as he hurriedly switched to Gods Retreat. At the same time, he took out the Substitute Talisman and stuck it on his body. He summoned the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon and had it appear in its six-winged form behind him.</p>
<p>He fully activated the Truth Listener earring’s abilities, blanketing the entire lake to clearly observe everything that happened.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the white-clothed man was definitely a Mythical dimensional creature.</p>
<p>Judging by the loud sound, Liu Yun was also thrown into the lake. The situation didn’t look good.</p>
<p>However, when the white-clothed, faceless man looked at the flower, he was enraged. He slammed the metal disc again, causing the surrounding lake water to explode and spray. It rose up more than ten meters.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also realized the problem. The thing that twinkled in the middle of the flower had vanished. Clearly, it had been taken by Liu Yun, but he hadn’t detected the moment when Liu Yun had taken it away.</p>
<p>He was fast! Just as Zhou Wen reeled in surprise, he saw Liu Yun rush out of the lake and climb ashore. He wanted to escape in the direction of the town.</p>
<p>However, the white-clothed man’s figure flashed. When he appeared again, he was already in front of Liu Yun, blocking his path.</p>
<p>622 Orange Ca</p>
<p>The white-clothed, faceless man was like a ghost as he drifted over. His figure appeared and disappeared from time to time. Li Yun was struggling to escape, but he couldn’t. He couldn’t beat him either, so he could only rely on the pair of black bracers and the protection of Genie to barely withstand the white-clothed, faceless man’s attacks.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, quickly help me!” Liu Yun shouted as he fought.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hid in the distance and didn’t move. He wasn’t familiar with Liu Yun, so it was naturally impossible for him to risk his life. He could take the opportunity to observe what abilities the white-clothed, faceless man had, so he could reap the benefits of the mutually destructive struggle.</p>
<p>The white-clothed, faceless man didn’t seem to have any terrifying skills, but Zhou Wen felt that he was somewhat odd. The clanging sound had actually shaken his soul. Even Truth Listener’s Evil Nullification was useless. It was obvious how terrifying he was.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t strike the metal disc again, Zhou Wen had to be wary.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen hiding in the distance without making a sound, Liu Yun used Genie to circle around the white-clothed, faceless man, but it didn’t have much of an effect. Although Genie wasn’t afraid of many kinds of destructive power, there was nothing he could do about the white-clothed, faceless man. Its flames were extinguished by the white-clothed, faceless man with a wave of his sleeve. It wasn’t of much use.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, help me. I’ll share the benefits with you,” shouted Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“What benefits? What’s inside the flower?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I can’t explain it in such a short period of time. Let’s work together to kill this monster first,” shouted Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as he continued hiding in the shadows.</p>
<p>“Half. I’ll give you half the benefits.” Li Yun shouted again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen remained unmoved. He had been observing the white-clothed, faceless man the entire time. The wooden staff in his hand didn’t seem to be anything special. Even so, Liu Yun didn’t dare let it hit him. All he dared to do was defend with his bracers.</p>
<p>His pair of bracers were definitely transformed from a Mythical Companion Beast. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for him to fend off the Golden Overlord Sword, nor could he block the attacks of the white-clothed, faceless man.</p>
<p>The Genie and the Mythical bracer could barely withstand the white-clothed, faceless man’s attacks. From this, it could be seen that although the white-clothed, faceless man looked ordinary, he was actually rather terrifying.</p>
<p>Genie’s ranking was still rather high. Yet, despite fighting the white-clothed, faceless man, he didn’t show any special performance. Clearly, he was restrained.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, at the very least, we studied under the same teacher. You can’t just leave me in the lurch.” Seeing Zhou Wen ignore him, Liu Yun sighed and said, “Fellow disciples should share weal and woe together. Don’t blame me for being heartless. Be careful of the staff in his hand. Don’t let it hit your body. Otherwise, your soul will immediately dissipate. It doesn’t matter how strong your body is.”</p>
<p>As Liu Yun spoke, he retreated while in combat. He ran towards Zhou Wen, clearly hoping to drag him into the fight.</p>
<p>How could Zhou Wen let him have his wish? Although he had many Mythical Companion Beasts and wasn’t necessarily afraid of the white-clothed, faceless man, there was no need for him to be Liu Yun’s shield.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gradually retreated. As Liu Yun was fighting while retreating, he naturally couldn’t keep up with his speed.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, I’m sorry. I’ll make it up to you when we meet again.” As Liu Yun spoke, he summoned an orange cat.</p>
<p>The orange cat was like a ball, but after appearing, it was extremely agile. It pounced at Zhou Wen like lightning.</p>
<p>It was strange. The white-clothed, faceless man had been chasing Liu Yun relentlessly, determined to take back the item from the flower.</p>
<p>However, the moment the orange cat appeared, the white-clothed, faceless man seemed to be attracted by a magnet. He gave up attacking Liu Yun and instead chased after the orange cat.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately figured out what the problem was. A mysterious wave emitted from the orange cat’s body, as though it was a taunting skill. It attracted the white-clothed, faceless man to chase after it.</p>
<p>Orange Cat was extremely fast as it led the white-clothed, faceless man towards Zhou Wen. Its body was as fat as a ball, but the way it positioned was extremely coquettish. It dodged the white-clothed, faceless man’s pursuit time and time again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pulled out the Golden Overlord Sword and slashed out a few sword beams at Orange Cat, but it dodged them all. It seemed to know a teleportation skill as it got closer and closer to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>There was only one way out with mountains surrounding the area. Zhou Wen had no choice but to fly up and escape using the sky.</p>
<p>However, just as he charged into midair, Orange Cat burrowed into the grass and the mysterious waves from its body vanished. The white-clothed, faceless man regained his clarity of mind and happened to see Zhou Wen fly up into the air like a ghost. He instantly caught up to Zhou Wen in midair.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother Zhou, I’ll thank you now. See you again if fate allows for it. I’ll treat you to a drink.” Liu Yun waved at Zhou Wen from afar. It was unknown when Orange Cat had returned to his embrace.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, you have to be careful. That fellow is the legendary Mountain God. The wooden staff in his hand can directly attack the soul. Using present-day parlance, it can attack one’s mind. Once you are hit, you will become an idiot. You have to be careful.” Liu Yun’s voice sounded from afar. It softened until it was almost inaudible.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen guessed what the white-clothed, faceless man was after hearing Liu Yun’s words. The Mountain God mentioned in ancient times wasn’t an embodiment of a mountain, but a powerful demon spirit in the mountain. There were many types.</p>
<p>One of them was extremely terrifying. It was called Ba. Legend had it that it was the ancestor of hopping zombies. Wherever it went, it could devour clouds and dragons. It was an extremely terrifying existence.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen estimated that the white-clothed, faceless man was probably something similar. It wasn’t as terrifying as the legendary Ba, but it wasn’t a character to be trifled with.</p>
<p>The wooden staff in the white-robed, faceless man’s hand was powerful. It was probably a manifestation of a plant-type Mythical creature. No one knew how the white-clothed, faceless man obtained it.</p>
<p>The metal disc in his other hand wasn’t an ordinary object either.</p>
<p>Faced with such a strange thing, Zhou Wen didn’t give it any chance. He directly summoned Truth Listener.</p>
<p>Truth Listener was a divine beast that kept hell in check. It definitely had the ability to restrain all kinds of demons and ghosts. It was the perfect time to use it.</p>
<p>The moment Truth Listener appeared, the white-clothed, faceless man’s body trembled. His legs seemed to go limp as he turned and ran. The awe-inspiring aura and baneful aura from before had completely vanished. He looked nervous like a lost dog.</p>
<p>Truth Listener transformed into a stream of light that flashed and caught up to the white-clothed, faceless man. It smashed his head with its claw.</p>
<p>With a clang, the white-clothed, faceless man fell to the ground and died. The wooden staff and metal disc in his hand dropped.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could walk over, Truth Listener had already dug out a crystal from his chest and swallowed it.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen thought that Truth Listener could restrain these things, he had not expected it to be so powerful. Truth Listener didn’t even use the Wheel of Destiny to kill the white-clothed, faceless man with a swipe.</p>
<p>Without any delay, Zhou Wen picked up the wooden staff and metal disc and stored them in the chaos space. He got Truth Listener to return to his ear before rushing back to the town. </p>
<h3 id='chapter623'>Chapter 623 Pearl</h3>
<p>Liu Yun escaped back to the town, but he didn’t leave immediately. Instead, he returned to the minimart at the corner of the street and took some things before walking out.“Junior Brother should be fine, right? He won’t be killed, right?” Liu Yun looked in the direction of the lake and muttered to himself.</p>
<p>However, in the blink of an eye, Liu Yun muttered to himself as though he was comforting himself, “The people that Teacher tutored shouldn’t die so easily. He even has the guts to target Chimera. The Companion Beasts on him are definitely no trifling matter. They aren’t inferior to Genie. Furthermore, with the Golden Greatsword and the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, he should be able to escape even if he can’t defeat Mountain God.”</p>
<p>After some thought, Liu Yun took a bottle of alcohol from his bag and placed it on the table by the door. He used his finger like a sword and etched a sentence on the wall beside him. “Junior Brother, thank you for your help. This bottle of vintage wine was stolen from the Family Clan of Gods with great difficulty. It’s been aged over a hundred years. Take it as my thanks. Don’t miss me. Let’s meet again if fate allows.”</p>
<p>“What a pity. I wonder if this junior brother of mine is a wine connoisseur. If he doesn’t, wouldn’t it be a waste?” Liu Yun looked at the bottle and muttered reluctantly.</p>
<p>With that said, Liu Yun prepared to leave.</p>
<p>“You should keep the wine for yourself. Leave the thing you took from the flower to redeem your sins.” A voice sounded from the roof not far away.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s expression changed drastically as he looked up and saw Zhou Wen standing on the rooftop opposite him. He immediately smiled. “Junior Brother, you sure are outstanding. You killed that Mountain God so quickly. You’re much stronger than me. It’s no wonder Teacher thinks so highly of the four of you. He even called you to his side before he left. You are indeed the cream of the crop.” Liu Yun said as he retreated to the side. It looked like he was about to escape.</p>
<p>“If I were you, I would stay still,” Zhou Wen said indifferently without stopping him.</p>
<p>“I also wish to have a good chat with you, Junior Brother. Unfortunately, the bureau is hounding me. If I were to stay here, I’m afraid I would implicate you. That wouldn’t be nice. I’ll take my leave now.” As Liu Yun spoke, he directed strength into his feet and attempted to rush out.</p>
<p>However, just as he exerted strength, the ground beneath his feet exploded. It was as though he had stepped on a landmine. Liu Yun’s reaction was fast enough as he tumbled away, reducing most of the explosive force. However, wherever his body rolled on the ground exploded.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Screams and explosions rang out. By the time Liu Yun stopped, his body was already charred black. His hair was standing up and still smoking.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, I never expected you to be proficient in Life Blast? That’s not right. You didn’t use a lifeform for the blast, so it shouldn’t be Life Blast. What skill is this?” Liu Yun stood rooted to the ground and didn’t dare move. He forced a smile and asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what skill it is either. If you are interested, why don’t you try taking another step?” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>When Liu Yun was packing up, Zhou Wen had already directed Explosive Fiend Man to set up many Time-Blasts nearby to prevent him from escaping.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, we are fellow disciples. Why do you have to do this? Why don’t we do this? We’ll split this treasure equally.” Liu Yun took out something from his pocket.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully sized up the item in Liu Yun’s hand. It was a blood-colored bead that was the size of a billiard ball. It was completely blood-red and crystalline, like an alluring red pearl. It flashed with a red glimmer as though something was flowing inside.</p>
<p>“Leave your life or leave that pearl behind. You can choose either one,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to be so ruthless, right?” Liu Yun smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>“If it wasn’t for Teacher, you would have died the moment you lured Mountain God to me,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn’t entirely because of this that Zhou Wen didn’t kill Liu Yun. Firstly, Liu Yun’s abilities and Companion Beasts were rather odd. He didn’t know what other means he had, so Zhou Wen wasn’t completely confident that he could ensure retaining him while not having the red bead destroyed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s interest in treasures was far greater than killing someone.</p>
<p>Secondly, Liu Yun had also told him about Mountain God when he left. Furthermore, there was a high chance that he was Wang Mingyuan’s student. There was no need for him to fight him to the death.</p>
<p>“Forget it. You are my junior brother after all? I’ll give you this treasure.” As Liu Yun spoke, he threw the red pearl at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>He summoned Genie at the same time and made it open up a path for him to escape in another direction. The direction he chose wasn’t to leave the town but to go towards the lake.</p>
<p>Liu Yun thought that Zhou Wen had set up a trap to prevent him from escaping. He thought he would have set up a trap in the direction of the town’s exit so he would escape into the forest before scaling a mountain. Naturally, he would be able to escape. After all, there probably hadn’t been enough time for Zhou Wen to set up traps all around him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out to grab the red pearl, but he realized that it was only a bubble. It shattered with a touch.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, you’re still too young to fight me.” Liu Yun held the red pearl in his hand and quickly rushed towards the forest outside the town.</p>
<p>Genie charged ahead, and there didn’t seem to be any explosions. Things had developed according to Liu Yun’s expectations. Zhou Wen hadn’t set up a trap in this direction.</p>
<p>Genie charged into the grasses and was fine, but when Liu Yun rushed into the grass, the plants suddenly exploded like bombs. Immediately, a series of tragic cries and explosions sounded.</p>
<p>When everything calmed down, Liu Yun was already lying on the ground covered in injuries. His handsome face had turned black, and most of his hair had been burnt.</p>
<p>“Try running again.” Zhou Wen came to Liu Yun’s side and took a deep breath. The red pearl was sucked out of Liu Yun’s sleeve and landed in Zhou Wen’s palm.</p>
<p>“You and your schemes. There’s nothing impressive about using traps and harming others. If you really have the ability, remove the surrounding traps and fight me openly. Whoever wins the battle will have the treasure,” said Liu Yun with a righteous tone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen curled his lips in disdain. This wasn’t the first time he had been hoodwinked. Once bitten, twice shy. Wang Mingyuan’s students looked young and handsome, but, including Wang Mingyuan, none of them were decent. Zhou Wen wouldn’t fight him in an open match unless he was crazy.</p>
<p>“Why are you being pursued by the bureau? Is it because of Teacher?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“No.” Liu Yun shook his head.</p>
<p>This answer exceeded Zhou Wen’s expectations, so he continued asking, “Then what’s the reason?”</p>
<p>“Because I stole something from the six families and the bureau’s headquarters.” Liu Yun puffed up his chest proudly. However, because he looked as though he had been struck by lightning, he didn’t look that impressive.</p>
<p>624 Signature in Hand</p>
<p>“What did you steal?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Liu Yun opened his mouth, but he suddenly closed it again. He was regretting it now. He shouldn’t have been greedy for the alcohol and food. After escaping, he should have left the town.</p>
<p>Liu Yun originally imagined that Zhou Wen wouldn’t return so quickly and would definitely be entangled by Mountain God for a long time. Who knew that Zhou Wen would be able to catch up so quickly and even have the time to set up so many Time-Blasts? If he had known, he wouldn’t have done all those things and would have long fled.</p>
<p>“I didn’t steal anything valuable. They’re all small things.” Liu Yun changed the topic and said, “Junior Brother, you have taken the treasure too. It’s time for me to leave. Can you remove your traps?”</p>
<p>Liu Yun had never seen an Essence Energy Skill like Time-Blast. He had seen Life Blast in the past, and he could also see the traces of Life Blast. However, it wasn’t easy for him to see any flaws with the Explosive Fiend Man’s Time-Blast. Furthermore, it wasn’t just used on living bodies. This made him stumble and suffer.</p>
<p>“Sure. Sign here and you can leave.” Zhou Wen placed a piece of paper and a pen in front of Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, what are you doing?” Liu Yun had been through a lot, so he knew that things weren’t as simple as signing an autograph.</p>
<p>“You can leave after you sign your signature,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Liu Yun forced out a smile. “It wasn’t easy for us fellow disciples to meet. As a senior brother, I should stay and accompany you more.”</p>
<p>“Even if you don’t want to leave, you have to sign it,” Zhou Wen continued.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s expression immediately turned bitter. “Junior Brother, we share the same roots, so why torment each other? Can we negotiate this nicely?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you want to know what Companion Beast I will use to challenge Chimera? Then I’ll let you experience it for yourself.” Zhou Wen looked at Liu Yun and was about to summon Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>“I’ll sign it.” Before Zhou Wen could summon Tyrant Behemoth, Liu Yun quickly picked up the paper and pen and signed his name before handing it to Zhou Wen. “Junior Brother, what’s the use of this signature?”</p>
<p>“As long as you don’t spout nonsense, this signature won’t be of any use. Don’t worry.” Zhou Wen folded and put it away when he saw the words “Liu Yun.”</p>
<p>In fact, the authenticity of the name didn’t matter. As long as he signed it in person, Explosive Fiend Man’s death list would take effect.</p>
<p>Now, with just a thought from the Explosive Fiend Man, he could kill Liu Yun who had signed his name.</p>
<p>“Alright, you can leave now.” Zhou Wen turned around and walked towards the town square.</p>
<p>“Remove the traps first before you leave.” Liu Yun had suffered terribly from the Time-Blast. If it wasn’t for the Time-Blast, he would have fled long ago.</p>
<p>After all, he was only at the Epic stage, and his Mythical pets couldn’t protect his entire body. He really couldn’t withstand the continuous explosions.</p>
<p>“There’s no more left. I didn’t have much time just now. I only had time to set up that many. You have already detonated them all,” Zhou Wen said without turning his head.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s face looked livid when he heard that. If he had known this would happen, he would have been able to escape even if he was injured. He had been robbed of the red pearl for nothing and had even signed his name for some unknown reason.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you leaving? Why are you following me?” Zhou Wen asked when he saw Liu Yun follow him from behind.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, I don’t feel at ease until you explain what that signature is for. It’s better I follow you.” Liu Yun had seen many strange Essence Energy Skills before, so he knew of some special Essence Energy Skills that just needed a name to kill someone thousands of kilometers away.</p>
<p>Liu Yun didn’t know which type of Essence Energy Skill Zhou Wen had, nor did he know what use it had. How could he leave just like that?</p>
<p>“Up to you.” Zhou Wen continued walking towards the town square.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, why don’t we do this? I’ll tell you a secret of the Cape family. Why don’t you return the paper to me?” Liu Yun said as he walked.</p>
<p>“I hate hearing secrets the most,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>However, Liu Yun continued disapprovingly, “The secret I’m talking about isn’t an ordinary piece of news. A while back, I tried my best to sneak into the Special Inspector Bureau and the few large families and learned quite a lot of secrets. You know the Zhang family, right? The family of the Hero King, the Zhang family’s princess, Zhang Yuzhi. Do you know why the Zhang family dotes on her so much?”</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen was intrigued.</p>
<p>“Because she’s very special. In recent years, the Zhang family’s strength has increased tremendously. It has something to do with the little princess of the Zhang family. I accidentally discovered this secret when I sneaked into the Zhang family residence to steal something. Other than the few upper echelons of the Zhang family, I’m afraid I’m the only one who knows this secret.” Liu Yun deliberately kept him in suspense.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t pursue the matter. He walked all the way to the square and saw the black cube.</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhou Wen didn’t pursue the matter, Liu Yun continued, “I’ll treat this secret as a free gift to you. The little princess of the Zhang family has a special Life Providence. With such a Life Providence, she can easily gain the favor of any dimensional creature, allowing them to treat her as one of their own. Think about it, this is such a terrifying ability. With Zhang Yuzhi, the Zhang family can easily grasp the habits and abilities of those Mythical creatures. Then, killing those Mythical creatures will be much easier. Such a person will be doted on like a princess no matter where they are. They definitely won’t let anything happen to her.”</p>
<p>“Zhang Yuzhi really has such a Life Providence?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“Don’t doubt me. I heard it myself. It’s definitely not fake news,” Liu Yun swore.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen was already convinced. This was because he had seen Zhang Yuzhi use her weak body to stop the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon in its rage. The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon actually didn’t injure her.</p>
<p>Back then, he felt that there was something odd about Zhang Yuzhi, but he didn’t think too deeply about it.</p>
<p>Now that he thought about it, Zhang Yuzhi really must have that ability or something even stronger.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen felt that there was still a problem with Zhang Yuzhi’s Life Providence. Back when the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon was killed, Zhang Yuzhi’s sorrow was definitely not faked.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen’s heart suddenly stirred. Could Zhang Yuzhi’s Life Providence be two-way? If she can make dimensional creatures treat her as a friend or relative, she might have the same feelings. That might be more reasonable.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that it was best if his guess didn’t come true. Otherwise, Zhang Yuzhi would be too pitiful.</p>
<p>If his guess was true, Zhang Yuzhi had already treated the dimensional creatures as family and friends. Yet, her family wanted to use her to kill them. That was a tragedy in itself.</p>
<p>As he pondered, Zhou Wen walked to the black cube and summoned Tyrant Behemoth. </p>
<h3 id='chapter625'>Chapter 625 Behemoth“s First Battle</h3>
<p>Boom!Tyrant Behemoth’s body that seemed to be made of obsidian landed, causing the ground around it to tremble.</p>
<p>This can’t be… Behemoth, right? Liu Yun was knowledgeable. He had once traveled across the world, so he quickly guessed Behemoth’s identity. He was even more alarmed.</p>
<p>Behemoth was a dimensional creature in the West District. Furthermore, it enjoyed a very high status in West District mythology. Many people in the West District guessed that Behemoth existed, but no one had seen it before.</p>
<p>Liu Yun never expected to see a Behemoth Companion Beast in Zhou Wen’s possession. Although he didn’t know if it was a pure Behemoth, it definitely had a Behemoth bloodline.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as he controlled Behemoth to mount the black cube. Then, it walked to the middle and injected Essence Energy into the circle.</p>
<p>The black cube immediately lit up. On the cube’s four screens, the top hundred Companion Beasts appeared. Zhou Wen found the thirteenth ranked Chimera and struck its name with Essence Energy.</p>
<p>It was like a touchscreen interface. Chimera’s name on the cube’s screen lit up. Then, a 72-hour countdown appeared behind the name.</p>
<p>If Chimera didn’t accept the challenge within 72 hours, Tyrant Behemoth would replace Chimera’s ranking and squeeze it out of the rankings.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth was pulled into a dimensional combat field by a beam of light from the cube. The images of Tyrant Behemoth appeared on the cubes around the world, as well as the name and countdown of the Chimera.</p>
<p>It’s really Behemoth! Liu Yun saw the name on the cube and knew that his previous guess had been correct.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth’s appearance immediately attracted the attention of the media around the world, especially the West District’s media. They were extremely enthusiastic about its appearance as they guessed who Tyrant Behemoth belonged to.</p>
<p>The people who had the most guesses were either from the Family Clan of Gods or the Cape family, but now, the people from the Cape family were alarmed.</p>
<p>It was fine that Behemoth had appeared, but it had actually challenged their Cape family’s Companion Beast. This made them suspect that the Family Clan of Gods in the West District was up to no good.</p>
<p>However, they didn’t have any evidence. Chimera’s owner didn’t immediately accept the challenge. The Cape family used all sorts of channels and means to begin investigating if Tyrant Behemoth was the doing of the Family Clan of Gods or if others in the West District were secretly enemies with them.</p>
<p>Another family that paid attention to Tyrant Behemoth was the Zhang family. Others didn’t know of Tyrant Behemoth’s origins, but the Zhang family knew very well that Tyrant Behemoth’s Companion Egg had originally belonged to them. It was only because of a traitor that they had lost the Tyrant Behemoth Companion Egg.</p>
<p>“It has finally appeared. The Behemoth Companion Egg that our Zhang family lost.” Zhang Xiao stared at Tyrant Behemoth in the video with a dark expression.</p>
<p>There were many brothers and many geniuses in the Zhang family. Mythical Companion Eggs weren’t enough for them all. If the Behemoth Companion Egg wasn’t lost, Zhang Xiao had a great chance of becoming its master. Therefore, Zhang Xiao paid special attention to this matter.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu patted Zhang Xiao on the shoulder and said, “Don’t force yourself when it’s destined. There will be stronger Mythical Companion Beasts waiting for you in the future.”</p>
<p>“I just want to know who stole the Behemoth Companion Egg and took what belongs to our Zhang family. They must pay the price,” Zhang Xiao said.</p>
<p>“According to our previous investigations, it’s most likely done by the overseas faction. When I return, I’ll accompany you to sea,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiao shook his head slightly. “Brother Qiu, let me handle this matter myself. How are your preparations?”</p>
<p>“Dugu Ge and Xia Liuchuan are already on their way. I hope there will be a result. If the cocoon really has a Guardian like the six-winged seraphim, we will have a new path to continue progressing,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“Is this path really correct?” Zhang Xiao questioned.</p>
<p>“Who knows? Even if it’s the wrong path, you have to walk it before you know,” Zhang Chunqiu said calmly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen waited for quite some time, but he didn’t see Chimera accept the challenge. All he could do was take out his tent and other items and set them up by the side. Then, he entered the tent and lay down to game while waiting for Chimera to accept the challenge.</p>
<p>With a time limit of 72 hours, it was unknown when the Cape family would accept the challenge. Zhou Wen guessed that they wouldn’t accept the challenge quickly, but they wouldn’t give up either.</p>
<p>The Cape family also wanted to know what kind of power Tyrant Behemoth had. Was it as terrifying as the mythical legends?</p>
<p>Looking at his size, Tyrant Behemoth was only a few meters tall. It didn’t look like a monster that could eat a thousand mountains daily. They definitely had their doubts.</p>
<p>In fact, Tyrant Behemoth still couldn’t eat a thousand mountains a day. However, eating a smaller mountain wasn’t a problem. Its body could change in size freely. This was the most confusing part.</p>
<p>Even if it was just a test, the Cape family wouldn’t let Chimera surrender without a fight.</p>
<p>However, they would definitely be very careful and wouldn’t give Zhou Wen too many chances. Therefore, Zhou Wen had to deliver a death strike to prevent them from even having the chance to admit defeat.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen expected, Chimera finally accepted the challenge after more than twenty hours and appeared on the cube’s arena.</p>
<p>The media immediately perked up as they live-streamed the battle. Behemoth and Chimera were terrifying existences in legend, but from a Mythical point of view, Chimera was definitely not as strong as Behemoth.</p>
<p>However, Tyrant Behemoth was only a few meters tall. Although it looked very strong, it didn’t seem to have the advantage when compared to Chimera, who was more than ten meters tall.</p>
<p>After Chimera appeared, it immediately ran quickly. However, it didn’t rush towards Tyrant Behemoth. Instead, it quickly circled around the arena and went behind Tyrant Behemoth. It suddenly leaped up and spread its wings. At the same time, its three heads roared together, condensing three different powers. It was like three light spheres were constantly expanding in their mouths.</p>
<p>After the red, yellow, and cyan beams reached an extreme point, they fused together like a volcanic eruption. They transformed into a terrifying white energy beam that struck Tyrant Behemoth in the arena.</p>
<p>That terrifying power appeared to blast through the entire arena.</p>
<p>“The Cape family is really careful. They actually used Chimera’s Wheel of Destiny—Gene Disintegration Ray. Are they thinking of surrendering the moment their single strike fails?” Zhang Chunqiu said with a smile.</p>
<p>“After all, it’s Behemoth. It’s only right for them to be careful,” Zhang Xiao said.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo was also watching this scene inside the Luoyang An family residence.</p>
<p>“Although Chimera isn’t the strongest Mythical pet, its Gene Disintegration Ray is indeed a very domineering Wheel of Destiny. If Tyrant Behemoth underestimates its enemy, I’m afraid it will suffer greatly,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen shouldn’t be someone who underestimates his enemy,” An Sheng said with a smile.</p>
<p>“How do you know that the Tyrant Behemoth must be his? Since when did you become so careless?” An Tianzuo sneered.</p>
<p>“Yes, Overseer. I’ve learned my mistake,” An Sheng said, but his eyes remained fixed on the projection.</p>
<h3 id='chapter626'>Chapter 626 Behemoth“s Migh</h3>
<p>Everyone looked at the terrifying beam descending from the sky as though it was a divine punishment that could destroy the world.Their gazes were focused on the ebony figure beneath the divine punishment. Under such a terrifying beam of light, the somewhat muscular body seemed tiny and minuscule, as though it would be drowned in a terrifying stream of light at any moment.</p>
<p>However, from beginning to end, Tyrant Behemoth didn’t move at all. It didn’t raise its head to look at the beam or at Chimera. It was as though its reaction was slow and had failed to notice the terrifying beam that descended from the sky.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The beam directly struck Tyrant Behemoth’s body. The streams of light constantly blasted the arena. The light exploded, drowning the entire arena in an explosion of light. Large amounts of dust rose up.</p>
<p>“How arrogant.” An Tianzuo frowned.</p>
<p>“He’s courting death by tanking the Gene Disintegration Ray.” The Cape family was overjoyed.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the Gene Disintegration Ray was appraised to be impossible to withstand head-on, even for Mythical Companion Beasts. Otherwise, their bodies’ genes would collapse.</p>
<p>“What a waste of a treasure. The person has such a powerful Companion Beast like Behemoth, but his usage of it is so crude. What a waste of such a powerful Companion Beast. No matter how powerful a Companion Beast is, it will still lose if one uses it recklessly,” Zhang Xiao said coldly.</p>
<p>“That’s not necessarily the case.” Zhang Chunqiu narrowed his eyes and muttered to himself.</p>
<p>Right then, in the midst of the explosion of light, a huge black mountain suddenly rose from the ground. The light blast that enveloped the arena turned into a cloud that seemed to linger around a black mountain. Although the light remained blinding, it couldn’t cause any substantial damage to the mountain.</p>
<p>As for the beam that shot down, it was like a waterfall of light. The mountain peak went against the waterfall and the waterfall immediately scattered, unable to stop the mountain’s rise.</p>
<p>“Not good… Quickly admit defeat and take back Chimera…” Senator Cape’s expression changed drastically as he ordered loudly.</p>
<p>However, it was already too late. The mountain-like Tyrant Behemoth opened its huge mouth and swallowed the stream of light along with Chimera. Instantly, the arena fell silent. The light vanished, leaving only a terrifying monster standing there.</p>
<p>The name of Chimera on the ranking vanished—replacing it was Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>“It ended just like that?” Instantly, all the spectators fell silent.</p>
<p>No one expected the battle to end like this. The extremely powerful Chimera, a ferocious beast that had once killed a dragon, was actually devoured in one mouthful.</p>
<p>The terrifying explosion of light was like a volcanic eruption. It was as laughable as useless fireworks.</p>
<p>“Too powerful… It’s really too powerful… As expected of our West District’s divine beast, Behemoth. It’s simply invincible. With such a powerful existence, what creature in the world can withstand it?”</p>
<p>“It’s way too invincible. That’s Chimera. Yet, it was swallowed in one mouthful.”</p>
<p>“How domineering. This is a truly invincible creature. What Primordial Sword Immortal? What Death of the Underworld? They are all weak. True men have to take it all in one mouthful.”</p>
<p>“God, that Tyrant might really be able to destroy the world.”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe my eyes. Tyrant Behemoth is too powerful. If I were its master, I think I would sit at home watching television before destroying the world.”</p>
<p>“That’s the tyrant who rules the world.”</p>
<p>Instantly, the Internet exploded with messages. Countless people were discussing Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>The faces of the Cape family members became uglier by the second. Mythical Companion Beasts were rare to begin with. Now that Chimera, one of the best Companion Beasts in the Cape family, was dead, they felt their hearts bleed as they were extremely furious.</p>
<p>“Investigate. I want a full investigation. We have to find out who the owner of Tyrant Behemoth is.” Senator Cape was extremely furious as he wished he could smash the television with one punch.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiao’s expression was equally ugly. Seeing Tyrant Behemoth’s strength made him feel even worse. This powerful Companion Beast might very well have belonged to him.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen really has a good life. He already has a powerful Companion Beast like Torch Dragon, yet he has an existence like Tyrant Behemoth. Together with the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon and other Companion Beasts, I think his Companion Beasts alone can challenge a hero family,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you underestimating the heritage of the six families? You’re ignoring the fact that Tyrant Behemoth might not be his. Even if it is his, it’s only the Companion Beast that’s strong. With insufficient strength himself, if he really wants to challenge a hero family, it’d be useless no matter how powerful a Companion Beast is,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“Overseer is right,” An Sheng said respectfully.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, this Behemoth of yours is pretty good. Where did you get it from? I’ll get one later.” Liu Yun’s eyes lit up as he looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I got it at an auction.” Zhou Wen took back Tyrant Behemoth and replied in a good mood.</p>
<p>“An auction? Which auction would sell something like that?” Liu Yun didn’t believe Zhou Wen at all. It would be a miracle if someone was willing to sell such a powerful Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“Make a guess.” Zhou Wen had unknowingly been influenced by people such as The Thearch and Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, are you interested in betting with me?” Liu Yun wasn’t interested in guessing. He didn’t believe Tyrant Behemoth was bought from an auction.</p>
<p>“Not interested.” Zhou Wen ignored Liu Yun and returned to his tent to game.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t plan on returning for the time being. He planned on getting Tyrant Behemoth to continue making challenges, but he still needed to study the target. It wasn’t suitable for him to directly challenge Primordial Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>However, the Federation and overseas faction were researching Tyrant Behemoth. Many people believed that Tyrant Behemoth’s strength wasn’t as simple as being ranked thirteenth. It was very likely that it had the strength to reach first on the rankings.</p>
<p>However, Tyrant Behemoth didn’t show much. Their analysis didn’t produce many results.</p>
<p>Liu Yun went out alone. After leaving Zhou Wen, he secretly went to a small forest to summon his Genie.</p>
<p>Liu Yun reached out to rub the oil lamp. Soon, Genie appeared in front of him. However, the Genie that appeared this time was different from before. Its entire body emitted a strange blue glow.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, as your senior brother, let me teach you a good lesson.” As Liu Yun spoke, he made a wish to the Genie. “Genie, I wish for my Life Soul’s power to be greatly enhanced.”</p>
<p>When the Genie heard Liu Yun’s wish, its body, which suffused a magical glow, drilled into Liu Yun’s body. Soon, Liu Yun’s entire body suffused a blue glow.</p>
<p>With the help of Genie and a Life Soul, my Star Stealer can forcefully steal the Companion Beast that has already hatched. That punk will never expect me to have such an ability. Unfortunately, Star Stealer can’t lock onto a target. I can only steal something randomly. However, it doesn’t matter. That punk has so many Mythical Companion Beasts. With the help of the Genie’s wish and Life Soul’s augmentation, I can attempt a theft ten times. No matter how unlucky I am, I should be able to steal a Mythical right? It’s best if it’s Tyrant Behemoth. If not, the Golden Greatsword would do… Liu Yun thought as he carefully took out something.</p>
<h3 id='chapter627'>Chapter 627 Star Stealer</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen was grinding in the tent when he felt the jade-like tiny person suddenly open its eyes in his sea of consciousness. Its body emitted a strange treasure glow.The treasure glow turned corporeal, piercing through his consciousness, causing Zhou Wen’s body to similarly emit a crystalline glow.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Why did Gods Retreat suddenly activate? Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised as he felt a vibration coming from somewhere on his body.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, he realized that the spot which was vibrating was actually a Musical Note Sprite tattoo. There was a Musical Note Sprite that seemed to be affected by some unknown force as it struggled to spread its wings.</p>
<p>However, due to the influence of the treasure glow generated by Gods Retreat, it was unable to fly out. It was trapped by the treasure glow like a butterfly trapped in a cage.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Zhou Wen attempted to control the power that Gods Retreat released, preventing the power from isolating the Musical Note Sprite tattoo.</p>
<p>With the power of Gods Retreat, the Musical Note Sprite tattoo immediately vanished under Zhou Wen’s nose. It only took a blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen had completely lost contact with the Musical Note Sprite, as though he had never had such a Companion Beast. If Zhou Wen hadn’t seen it disappear with his own eyes, he wouldn’t have realized that he had lost a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>What power took away the Musical Note Sprite? Zhou Wen’s first reaction was to expand the power of the Truth Listener earring to its limit. He could hear the surrounding areas clearly. Even the falling of a strand of hair to the ground couldn’t escape his ears.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen discovered Liu Yun, who was hiding outside the town. The fellow was squatting in the grass. At a glance, it looked like he was shitting, but upon careful inspection, the fellow hadn’t even taken off his pants as he mumbled something.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen listened carefully and heard Liu Yun say, “What’s wrong with my Junior Brother? Why does he have such trashy Companion Beasts? Junior Brother, don’t worry. I’m still a gentleman. I’ll stop after stealing a Mythical Companion Beast from you.”</p>
<p>Indeed, this fellow is up to no good. He’s really not afraid of death. Zhou Wen took a careful look and indeed, he saw the tattoo of a Musical Note Sprite on his body. It was identical to the one he had lost.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen remained unperturbed. He wanted to see what Liu Yun was up to.</p>
<p>Liu Yun didn’t know that Truth Listener’s range was that large. He was already so far away; yet, Zhou Wen could still monitor him.</p>
<p>Previously, the reason Liu Yun could make Truth Listener lose its effects was that he had already discovered Zhou Wen and determined that Zhou Wen was observing him. That was why he had allowed Genie to release its power to affect Truth Listener’s abilities.</p>
<p>Now, he didn’t know that Zhou Wen could monitor him from such a distance. Furthermore, with his Star Stealer’s ability, he could usually steal Companion Beasts without anyone noticing. It was impossible for the person he stole from to discover him.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast that Liu Yun had set up to keep watch didn’t notice anything from Zhou Wen. He imagined that Zhou Wen hadn’t even discovered that his Companion Beast had been stolen.</p>
<p>In fact, he wouldn’t have discovered the disappearance of the Musical Note Sprite if Zhou Wen didn’t habitually have Gods Retreat activated.</p>
<p>“Anyway, there are still nine chances. I’m sure I can steal a Mythical Companion Beast.” Liu Yun gritted his teeth and reached out to grab at the void.</p>
<p>His fingertips shimmered with strange starlight as though something was burning. The starlight tore through the void, causing Liu Yun’s hand to vanish as though it was invisible.</p>
<p>When the hand pulled back from the void, there was a lively Musical Note Sprite in his hand. The Musical Note Sprite circled around him and automatically landed on him, turning into a tattoo.</p>
<p>Just like last time, Zhou Wen felt the tattoo of a Musical Note Sprite vibrate. He removed the power of Gods Retreat Life Soul, making the Musical Note Sprite tattoo vanish.</p>
<p>This fellow actually has such an ability! Doesn’t that mean he’s invincible? He can steal any Mythical Companion Beast he likes! Zhou Wen was alarmed as he continued observing silently.</p>
<p>It was better to encounter such a strange ability than to encounter it in the future. Now that he had figured out what was going on, he would have some experience for the future. He would know how to deal with it. This wasn’t a bad thing for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, why is it still a Musical Note Sprite? Why does that punk have so many trash Companion Beasts with him?” Liu Yun felt depressed when he saw that it was another Musical Note Sprite.</p>
<p>“Although they’re stolen randomly, the chances of obtaining the same Companion Beast in a row shouldn’t be high, right?” Liu Yun didn’t believe it as he reached out to steal again.</p>
<p>So it turns out that the ability to steal Companion Beasts is random. Zhou Wen discovered some problems. On Liu Yun’s fingertip, there was a short strand of hair. When Liu Yun used Star Stealer, the strand of hair would burn.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew at a glance that it was his hair.</p>
<p>When did this fellow steal my hair? Zhou Wen had to admit that Liu Yun was indeed top-notch when it came to stealing. He was actually able to steal his hair without him noticing.</p>
<p>Knowing that Liu Yun’s stealing of Companion Beasts was random, Zhou Wen felt relieved. He had been farming Musical Note Sprites for so long. Almost every time he respawned, he would farm the dungeon. Now, the number of Musical Note Sprites he possessed had reached more than four thousand. Altogether, Zhou Wen had more than five thousand Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>The chance of stealing his Mythical Companion Beasts was about one in a thousand. This would be extremely difficult unless one had Wang Lu’s luck.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that he could only discover that Liu Yun had stolen something from him when the Gods Retreat Life Soul was activated. Even Truth Listener’s hearing and Evil Nullification were useless.</p>
<p>If Gods Retreat wasn’t activated, the Companion Beast tattoo on his body would vanish without a trace. Unless he happened to see the tattoo disappear, it would be very difficult to discover that he had lost his Companion Beast.</p>
<p>What skill is this? Where can I obtain such a skill? Zhou Wen felt that he could learn similar skills.</p>
<p>In the future, anytime he saw people from the Cape family and the Special Inspector Bureau, he could try stealing from them.</p>
<p>“Another Musical Note Sprite?” Liu Yun nearly jumped up in frustration when he saw the Companion Beast he had stolen.</p>
<p>In his rage, Liu Yun quickly grabbed with both hands, constantly using the Star Stealer to grab Companion Beasts one after another.</p>
<p>Musical Note Sprite… Musical Note Sprite… Musical Note Sprite… Another Musical Note Sprite… Liu Yun stole with both hands, but in the end, they were all Musical Note Sprites. He had already stolen seven of them in a row. He only had three chances left out of his ten attempts.</p>
<p>“What the hell? How many Musical Note Sprites did that punk bring with him? How can I be only getting a Musical Note Sprite each time?” Liu Yun was so angry that he nearly vomited blood.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen chuckled inwardly. More than 90% of the Companion Beasts on him were Musical Note Sprites. He wouldn’t find it strange if all Liu Yun’s thefts were Musical Note Sprites.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen still carefully used Gods Retreat to confirm that Liu Yun didn’t steal an important Companion Beast. Only then would he release it and let him steal it.</p>
<p>“No, I can’t continue like this. That punk has countless Musical Note Sprites on him. I have to think of a way.” Liu Yun had no intention of giving up. The Genie’s wish had been used. Even if he didn’t continue stealing, he wouldn’t have his wish refunded. He could only continue stealing.</p>
<h3 id='chapter628'>Chapter 628 Life Reversing Spirit Talisman</h3>
<p>Liu Yun hesitated for a moment. Finally, he made up his mind and took out something from his pocket.It was a strange jade talisman that was just the size of a palm. It was jade-white in color, but there was a red symbol engraved on it. It looked strange, its meaning was unknown.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t easy for me to get this Life Reversing Spirit Talisman from the Zhang family. This is the only one I have. I originally planned to try my luck after meeting the owner of Primordial Sword Immortal, but I can’t be bothered with that now.” As Liu Yun spoke, he held the jade talisman in his hand and used Star Stealer again.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Before Liu Yun’s palm reached into the void, the jade talisman shattered. The blood-colored runes seeped into his palm and shimmered.</p>
<p>“The Zhang family’s Life Reversing Spirit Talisman can flip Yin and Yang and turn the universe on its head. Although it can’t really change fate, it can invert the probability of my Star Stealer. It will allow me to steal the Companion Beast with the lowest probability, the ones that are almost impossible to steal. Although it doesn’t mean that the chances of a Mythical Companion Beast are the lowest, typically speaking, one only has one Mythical Companion Beast. The chances are definitely not high. Therefore, the chances of stealing a Mythical Companion Beast are definitely very high for me now.”</p>
<p>Liu Yun muttered to himself as he suddenly pulled out his hand. At the same time, he shouted, “Come, Tyrant Behemoth. I have a feeling that it’s definitely you this time.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was given a fright when he heard Liu Yun’s words. He was really afraid that Tyrant Behemoth would really be stolen. He focused his attention and circulated Gods Retreat.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast tattoo trembled, his expression turned odd.</p>
<p>The trembling tattoo was actually Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>Ever since he had obtained the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, Zhou Wen had been very careful. He didn’t dare release him easily, afraid that he would be affected by the Jinxes Master skill.</p>
<p>Previously, Zhou Wen still needed the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to restrain Qiongqi. Now, with Tyrant Behemoth, there was no need for him. Zhou Wen had been in a dilemma on how to deal with it.</p>
<p>He never expected Liu Yun to steal the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen released the restrictions and got Liu Yun to steal the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>I can observe the effects of the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s Jinxes Master skill on others. Will the Jinxes Master Skill only take effect when released? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>“Come on, my Tyrant Behemoth…” Liu Yun quickly pulled out his palm from the void.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was overjoyed when he saw that it wasn’t a Musical Note Sprite that came out of his palm.</p>
<p>However, upon careful inspection, it wasn’t Tyrant Behemoth. Instead, it was a heavy-armored warrior riding a tiger. He looked extremely ferocious and domineering, exuding an extraordinary aura.</p>
<p>A humanoid Companion Beast? Its aura is so domineering and ferocious. Could it be a Mythical Companion Beast? Liu Yun watched as the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General transformed into a stream of light that landed on him. At the same time, some information surged into his mind.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Liu Yun didn’t have the mysterious phone. He couldn’t check the information regarding the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. All he could do was obtain some information from the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to gather some vague details.</p>
<p>“Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General… Epic…” Liu Yun learned the name and level of the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. He could also sense the Life Providence and Life Soul a little, but it was limited to their names. He didn’t know much about it. All he could do was wait until he summoned it out to test its various abilities in combat.</p>
<p>“I never expected that punk to have such a good life.” Liu Yun had no choice. After much difficulty, he had only managed to steal one Life Reversing Spirit Talisman from the Zhang family. Even the Zhang family didn’t have many. It would be impossible to steal one from them again.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was too late. He only had two thefts left.</p>
<p>He had once again used Star Stealer, but it was still a Musical Note Sprite.</p>
<p>“This is the last time. God, Mother Mary, bless me. Let me steal a big one…” Liu Yun prayed before using Star Stealer again.</p>
<p>When a Companion Beast appeared in his palm, Liu Yun was delighted when he saw that it wasn’t a Musical Note Sprite. However, when he pulled it out, he realized that it was only an Epic Poison Bat. He couldn’t help but be greatly disappointed.</p>
<p>“It’s really a huge loss. I wasted a wish and even used the Life Reversing Spirit Talisman. I only managed to steal these crappy things…” Liu Yun was so depressed that he wanted to vomit blood.</p>
<p>He clearly knew that Zhou Wen had many Mythical Companion Beasts, but he had only managed to steal trash. It was unacceptable.</p>
<p>There was nothing he could do even if he was indignant about it. He had expended a lot of energy this time, so it was impossible for him to use Star Stealer anytime soon.</p>
<p>“Forget it.” Liu Yun got up and prepared to return. He had already made up his mind. He would pretend to lose his Companion Beast and then accuse Zhou Wen of being a villain. It would be fine as long as Zhou Wen thought that the dimensional creatures nearby were fooling around.</p>
<p>“How unlucky. How can I only steal those crappy things?” Liu Yun felt a little depressed. There was a small stone in front of him, so he kicked it.</p>
<p>However, the stone remained motionless despite the kick. Liu Yun felt as though he had kicked a metal plate. He cried out in pain as he hugged his foot.</p>
<p>“With my foot’s strength, even steel should be shattered. How can the stone remain motionless…” Liu Yun felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Before he could take a closer look at the stone, he saw the surrounding soil split open. The flowers and trees seemed to have been lifted up by something as they rose out of the soil.</p>
<p>Liu Yun felt the ground beneath his feet rise as he hurriedly retreated.</p>
<p>As he retreated, he saw a huge gray object burrow out of the ground. From its appearance, it looked like a huge Horned Beetle. Its body was the size of a truck. The small stone that Liu Yun had kicked was the tip of the Horned Beetle’s horn.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” Liu Yun had seen many dimensional creatures that resembled Horned Beetles, but this was the first time he had seen such a huge one.</p>
<p>Not only was this Horned Beetle huge, but its body was also like a gray stone. It looked odd and there were many ancient and mysterious patterns on its back.</p>
<p>The instant the Horned Beetle tore out of the ground, it charged at Liu Yun. Its speed was much faster than a real truck. It was like a fast-moving vehicle.</p>
<p>Mythical creature! Liu Yun nearly cried out in surprise. Without any hesitation, he exerted his strength to leap up and dodge the attack of the Horned Beetle.</p>
<p>However, when he exerted strength, he lost his footing. Not only did he fail to jump, but his legs sank in.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The front end of the Horned Beetle had already slammed into Liu Yun. The powerful force blasted apart the surrounding soil and trees, forming a huge crater. It was like a meteorite hitting the ground.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, could this be the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s Jinxes Master skill? I didn’t think it was that powerful when I had him with me. Zhou Wen wore a look of surprise when he saw this. He couldn’t be certain that it was because of the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General because Liu Yun hadn’t summoned it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter629'>Chapter 629 Tears of Regre</h3>
<p>Liu Yun grabbed the horn of the Horned Beetle with both hands and pushed upwards with all his might, but his body continued sinking.His arm was wrapped in a black bracer and surprisingly wasn’t shattered by the Horned Beetle’s terrifying slam. It was just that the other parts of his body couldn’t withstand the powerful shockwave. His armor shattered and many parts of his body were injured. It didn’t look like he was doing well.</p>
<p>He actually managed to withstand such a terrifying collision. He only suffered some superficial injuries. This senior brother of mine does have some capabilities. He’s not only good at stealing things. Zhou Wen watched Liu Yun and the Horned Beetle fight without any intention of helping.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s muscles tensed up as he suffused a metallic luster. In the clash with the Horned Beetle, his body kept sinking.</p>
<p>He didn’t dare to release his grip and retreat. He was afraid that if he let go, the Horned Beetle’s terrifying power would slam down like a crashing mountain, making it impossible for him to dodge.</p>
<p>Genie had already flown up and spewed out flames to attack the Horned Beetle. However, the patterns on its back only shimmered as the flames failed to approach its body.</p>
<p>“Fat Orange…” Liu Yun gritted his teeth and shouted.</p>
<p>The orange cat darted out of Liu Yun’s body and ran in another direction. At the same time, it emitted a mysterious wave that could lure dimensional creatures to chase after it.</p>
<p>The Horned Beetle was affected by the mysterious waves, reducing its downward pressure significantly. At the same time, it turned to look at Orange Cat.</p>
<p>Liu Yun thought that he finally had a chance to escape. Just as he was about to retreat, the Horned Beetle glanced at the Orange Cat before choosing not to chase after Orange Cat. In a surprise turn of events, it quickly turned around and slammed the horn at Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, what’s going on? This dimensional creature isn’t affected by Fat Orange?” Liu Yun was alarmed as he raised his arms to meet the attack.</p>
<p>Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!</p>
<p>The Horned Beetle lashed out repeatedly as terrifying forces struck Liu Yun’s arms. His body was like a wooden stake as he sank into the soil. Only his chest was exposed.</p>
<p>Blood seeped out of Liu Yun’s seven orifices. Although the pair of bracers were magical and could withstand Mythical strength, his body wasn’t able to withstand such tremors. If this continued, all his bones and organs would be pulverized.</p>
<p>“If a tiger doesn’t show its might, do you really think I’m a sick cat!” A terrifying power erupted from Liu Yun’s hands. A pair of black bracers crossed together, forming a black hole that looked like it was about to swallow the Horned Beetle.</p>
<p>The Horned Beetle crashed into the black hole, but before the black hole could suck it in, the patterns on its body emitted a strange force that turned into a net to seal the black hole.</p>
<p>The Horned Beetle’s horn was inside the black hole, but its body was outside. It formed a stalemate with Liu Yun, with both parties unable to do anything to each other.</p>
<p>Liu Yun hid some of his abilities while fighting me. This black hole-like ability should be the Wheel of Destiny ability of those bracers, right? Zhou Wen watched with relish. Such battles were rare to see. He approached the battlefield, hoping to get a better view.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, quickly save me!” Liu Yun hurriedly cried out when he saw Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother, weren’t you trying to steal my Companion Beasts?” Zhou Wen found a spot to sit down and asked Liu Yun with a smile.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, how could I steal your Companion Beasts? You think too highly of me. How can I have that ability? My Companion Beast has also been lost. It must have been this Horned Beetle’s doing. Quickly join forces with me and kill it. No matter what drops, it will belong to you,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if you don’t admit it. I’ll wait here for the two of you to decide the victor,” Zhou Wen said calmly.</p>
<p>Liu Yun found it increasingly difficult to persist. He gritted his teeth and said, “Junior Brother, it’s all my fault. I just wanted to pull your leg. I didn’t really want to steal your things. Otherwise, why would I only take a few of your Musical Note Sprites?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t expose him as he continued asking, “What’s the name of the skill you used to steal my Companion Beasts? Where did you get it from?”</p>
<p>“That’s Star Stealer. It’s an Essence Energy Skill from an Astral Combat Beast in the Endless Sea of Stars,” Liu Yun said gloomily. “Junior Brother, what’s the matter? Can we wait until we finish this first? What do you want to know? As your senior brother, I’ll definitely tell you everything I know.”</p>
<p>“Where’s the Endless Sea of Stars? What stage is the Astral Combat Beast? How can I find it?” Zhou Wen ignored him and continued asking.</p>
<p>“The Endless Sea of Stars is actually a dimensional zone in the former Taklamakan Desert. I only saw it by accident, so I didn’t dare venture deep into it. I don’t know if there’s anything else inside. The Astral Combat Beast is a Mythical creature,” Liu Yun answered.</p>
<p>“Are you still lying to me?” Zhou Wen said with a cold expression.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, I’m really not lying to you.” The black hole in Liu Yun’s hand was becoming weaker and weaker, as if it would collapse at any moment.</p>
<p>“You said that Astral Combat Beast is at the Mythical stage, so Star Stealer is a Mythical Essence Energy Skill. How can an Epic like you absorb a Mythical Essence Energy Skill Crystal?” Zhou Wen said coldly.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, you might not know, but the Essence Energy Art I cultivate is called the ‘Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art’. It’s recorded on a stone monument in the Endless Sea of Stars. It’s because of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art that I can absorb that Mythical Essence Energy Skill Crystal. However, I can only absorb this type of Mythical Essence Energy Skill Crystal. I’ve tried other types, but it’s impossible. I’ll die a terrible death if I’ve lied to you,” Liu Yun swore.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, I really can’t take it anymore. Quickly save me!” Liu Yun really couldn’t hold on any longer. The black hole in his hand disappeared, and the Horned Beetle regained its freedom. It angrily slammed forward again.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s hands were knocked apart. He looked exhausted and couldn’t hold on any longer.</p>
<p>Seeing the Horned Beetle slam its head down again, with Genie’s flames useless against it, it seemed unstoppable. Orange Cat couldn’t help much in battle. Liu Yun believed that he was doomed.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth descended from the sky and stepped on the Horned Beetle’s back, shattering the stone shell on its back. Its hands clenched into fists as it repeatedly pounded the Horned Beetle’s head.</p>
<p>After a few punches, the Horned Beetle’s head cracked. The final punch smashed through the Horned Beetle’s head, sending fragments flying everywhere.</p>
<p>Exhausted, Liu Yun hurriedly turned around and crawled out of the hole. Just as he crawled out, the Horned Beetle’s broken horn shot over at a speed faster than a bullet, hitting Liu Yun’s buttocks.</p>
<p>“Ah!” A shrill scream pierced through the night sky of the town.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Liu Yun, who was sprawled on the ground with tears of regret flowing out of his eyes. The horn was raised over him like a flag. He couldn’t help but shiver.</p>
<p>I’ve had the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General for so long, but nothing major happened. I’m really lucky. I have to offer incense when I return. I have to thank all the deities for their blessings, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<h3 id='chapter630'>Chapter 630 – Unlucky Liu Yun</h3>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother, are you dead?” Zhou Wen walked to Liu Yun’s side and asked.</p>
<p>“I have a cockroach’s life. How can I die so easily… Ouch… Junior Brother… Help me… pull that thing out…” Liu Yun wanted to get up, but it immediately pulled his wound, causing him to cry out in pain.</p>
<p>Typically, if one was injured by a weapon, one wouldn’t randomly pull it out. One needed a professional doctor to carry out the procedure. However, an Epic human’s body and vitality far exceeded the average person, so they didn’t worry too much.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his hand and directed a suction force across space, pulling out the broken horn. It made Liu Yun cry out in pain.</p>
<p>“Can you still walk? If you can walk, let’s return to the town.” Zhou Wen planned on asking Liu Yun about the Endless Sea of Stars. No one would find a skill as useful as Star Stealer excessive. He also planned on making a trip to the Endless Sea of Stars to see if he could find the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had heard that many deserts were forbidden grounds for humans. The dimensional zones there were especially terrifying. If one wanted to enter the desert without a guide, one could easily be lost in one terrifying dimensional zone after another.</p>
<p>Without Liu Yun leading the way, Zhou Wen guessed that it would be difficult for him to find the Endless Sea of Stars in the desert.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Liu Yun got up and limped in with an especially strange posture.</p>
<p>After taking a few steps, he missed a step and vanished. All Zhou Wen could hear was a loud cry coming from below before a loud thud.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned around and saw a hole in the spot where Liu Yun had been. He looked over and saw that it was originally a well. Due to the earlier battle, it had been covered by branches and soil.</p>
<p>Liu Yun hadn’t noticed it, and due to his injuries, he fell the moment he stepped on it.</p>
<p>By the time Liu Yun climbed up, he was really in a sorry state. Coupled with his injuries, he looked even more miserable.</p>
<p>“Brother, help me up. I’m dying…” Liu Yun stretched out his hand, looking exhausted.</p>
<p>“Walk by yourself.” Zhou Wen immediately dodged far away. Who knew if Liu Yun would implicate others around him when he was being jinxed?</p>
<p>“Are you still human? I’m already so injured; yet, you aren’t giving me a hand…” Liu Yun limped towards the town.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored him and walked towards the town square.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, be honest. Did you do something to me? I know I was wrong to steal your Companion Beast. I guarantee that there won’t be a next time. Look at how miserable I am. Please spare me…” Liu Yun said as he walked. He also felt that something was amiss with his situation. He had never been so unlucky.</p>
<p>“Don’t spout nonsense. I definitely didn’t do anything to you. Sometimes, it’s a result of one’s own doing. Even God can’t sit idle,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother…” Liu Yun wanted to say something, but a bird flew across the sky and pooped on his head.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw this scene, he immediately sped up and distanced himself from him to prevent himself from being implicated.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I can’t randomly fuse the baby tiger. Otherwise, if I create another one that jinxes its master, I might harm myself, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>After returning to the square, Zhou Wen began studying the Companion Beasts ranked ahead of Tyrant Behemoth, and prepared for the next challenge.</p>
<p>It wasn’t suitable to directly challenge first place—Primordial Immortal Sword. Neither was Death of the Underworld who came in second. Furthermore, Death of the Underworld was a spirit. Zhou Wen didn’t know if a pure Strength-type Companion Beast like Tyrant Behemoth could deal fatal damage to Death of the Underworld, so he didn’t consider it for now.</p>
<p>No matter how powerful Tyrant Behemoth was, he still had to consider the problem of something having an advantage over it. No matter how powerful a Companion Beast was, it couldn’t defy common logic to fight a Companion Beast that had an advantage over it.</p>
<p>Among the twelve Companion Beasts ranked ahead, some of them were from the six families, while the others were from overseas. Zhou Wen wasn’t too sure either.</p>
<p>If possible, Zhou Wen planned on challenging an overseas Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could come to a conclusion, he saw Liu Yun walk back. However, from the looks of it, he was in a worse state than before. His nose was bruised and his face swollen. Zhou Wen did not know what he had done.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, I really know my mistake. Save me. If this continues, I will definitely die,” Liu Yun said tearfully.</p>
<p>He had never been so unlucky ever since he was born. The unlucky things he had encountered today numbered more than everything he had encountered in life.</p>
<p>“Let me ask you. What’s that Life Reversing Spirit Talisman?” Zhou Wen asked Liu Yun.</p>
<p>In the past, Zhou Wen had fused many pets but had failed to get rid of Jinxes Master. He failed to get rid of the pet even with a fusion with single-digit probabilities.</p>
<p>Back then, Zhou Wen suspected that fusion wouldn’t fail as long as it had Jinxes Master.</p>
<p>However, it was useless even if he didn’t fail. As long as Jinxes Master existed, he definitely wouldn’t dare use it. Liu Yun’s miserable state strengthened his resolve.</p>
<p>To have Liu Yun successfully steal the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was equivalent to the failure of Jinxes Master. The Life Reversing Spirit Talisman was indeed magical.</p>
<p>“That’s a treasure I stole from the Zhang family. I heard that it was passed down from the Zhang family’s ancestors. There aren’t many of them in total. I was lucky to have stolen one,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“It was passed down by its ancestors? Isn’t it something from a dimensional zone?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>“No, the Zhang family had a long history before the dimensional storms. Their family was already very famous in ancient times. They controlled a sect, and legend has it that they have the ability to predict the future. I’m not too sure about the details either. After all, this family is very mysterious. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have produced a figure like the Hero King,” explained Liu Yun.</p>
<p>The Zhang family… Could it be that Ancestral Master? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and really thought of one such person.</p>
<p>However, that was history from long ago. Zhou Wen didn’t study history, and he had only heard of such a person. He wasn’t sure of the exact details.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, if you want the Life Reversing Spirit Talisman, I’ll go to the Zhang family later. I’ll risk my life to steal another one for you. Help me dispel the bad luck on me first. Can you return the signed piece of paper to me?” Liu Yun believed that the reason he was so unlucky was that Zhou Wen had used the signed paper to do something to him after discovering that he had stolen his Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>He had no idea that Zhou Wen hadn’t used the signed paper at all. It was purely because of Jinxes Master.</p>
<p>“Return all the Companion Beasts you stole from me.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment. He still wanted Liu Yun to take him to the Endless Sea of Stars. If he were to continue being so unlucky, he probably wouldn’t be able to reach the Endless Sea of Stars before Liu Yun died.</p>
<p>“If you want a Companion Beast, I’ll think of a way to get a Mythical Companion Egg for you. There’s no need for me to return them, right?” said Liu Yun with a bitter expression.</p>
<h3 id='chapter631'>Chapter 631 Being Challenged</h3>
<p>The Companion Beasts that Liu Yun stole were equivalent to Companion Beasts that he had hatched. To transfer them to someone else required paying a huge price.</p>
<p>“I only want the things that belong to me. I don’t want anything else. It’s up to you.” Zhou Wen wanted to take back the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul Essence and see if Liu Yun remained unlucky.</p>
<p>If he wasn’t unlucky anymore, then the previous mishaps were undoubtedly due to Jinxes Master.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen wouldn’t let Liu Yun know where the problem stemmed from. It was fine as long as he mistakenly thought that it was due to his signature. This prevented him from doing anything rash in the future.</p>
<p>“I’ll return them, alright? You’re really my Junior Brother. You’re going to kill me.” Liu Yun said with a bitter expression, “Those low-level Musical Note Sprites are useless. Can’t you give them up?”</p>
<p>“No, not one less,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Liu Yun had no choice but to return the Companion Beasts he had stolen from Zhou Wen. Every time he transferred a Companion Beast, Liu Yun felt as though a chunk of meat had been ripped off his body. His expression turned uglier and paler. He was as white as a sheet.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He originally didn’t expect Liu Yun to really return all ten Companion Beasts. After all, others might die from transferring a single Companion Beast. A few lives weren’t even enough to transfer ten Companion Beasts. Even Zhou Wen himself didn’t dare casually transfer his Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Liu Yun forcefully transferred the ten Companion Beasts. Although he ended up vomiting blood and falling to the ground, almost half dead, he didn’t hurt his foundation. It was obvious that there was something strange about him. Otherwise, he would have long died.</p>
<p>Could it be an effect of cultivating the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art? Zhou Wen was even more expectant of the Endless Sea of Stars.</p>
<p>Typical dungeons didn’t attract Zhou Wen much anymore, but he really wanted to visit places like the Endless Sea of Stars. It would be great if he could download it on his phone.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, I’ve returned the Companion Beast to you. Quickly return me the autograph,” Liu Yun said weakly as he lay on the ground. He was so weak that he didn’t even have the strength to stand up.</p>
<p>“Senior Brother, I’ll keep your autograph. However, don’t worry. As long as you don’t have any more nasty thoughts, nothing will happen again. By the way, I want to go to the Endless Sea of Stars to take a look. How long will it take for a return trip?” Zhou Wen asked Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“It’ll take at least a month or two.” Liu Yun was depressed not to get the autograph back, but thankfully, he didn’t continue to be unlucky. He felt much better.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen observed Liu Yun the entire time. Seeing that nothing had happened to him, he was certain that the things he had encountered previously were the problems caused by Jinxes Master.</p>
<p>If it really doesn’t work, I’ll use the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul to Tyrant as food later. Zhou Wen wanted to wait and see if he would be affected by Jinxes Master like Liu Yun.</p>
<p>He felt that the possibility wasn’t too high because he had always taken the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General around with him. He wasn’t as unlucky as Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen had the Bamboo Blades of the Four Gentlemen Blades. Legend had it that they jinxed their masters. Although his luck was lacking, he wasn’t as unlucky as Liu Yun.</p>
<p>If the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General really doesn’t hinder me, can I use the advantage of never having a fusion fail to upgrade Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General? Zhou Wen placed his sights on his Mythical Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Mythical Companion Beasts had a low chance of success when fusing with ordinary pets, but if it fused with the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, then a low compatibility didn’t seem to be a problem.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only had such a thought, but he hadn’t decided if he should carry out the fusion. This was because he didn’t know why he wasn’t affected by Jinxes Master. If the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General advanced to the Mythical stage and Jinxes Master became strong enough to affect him, it wouldn’t be worth it.</p>
<p>He chatted with Liu Yun for a while. With Liu Yun not showing any more problems and Zhou Wen himself being fine, the two relaxed.</p>
<p>According to Liu Yun, Zhou Wen knew that the Endless Sea of Stars was deep in the Taklamakan Desert. The area was chaotic and there were many strange dimensional zones. Furthermore, the dimensional zones were mobile, meaning they weren’t fixed. Finding the Endless Sea of Stars was an extremely difficult task.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen promised Liu Yun that as long as he could safely find the Endless Sea of Stars and safely bring Zhou Wen out, he would return the autograph to him. The two of them reached an initial agreement.</p>
<p>Just as they were discussing how to head to the Endless Sea of Stars, the black cube suddenly lit up. A Companion Beast issued a challenge.</p>
<p>A terrifying Companion Beast projection appeared on the cube’s screen.</p>
<p>At a glance, it looked like eight dragons that were entangled together. On careful look, it was a terrifying snake with eight heads and eight tails. Its torso was connected together, but its heads looked like those of a dragon. However, its snake body didn’t have any dragon claws.</p>
<p>“Orochi. Who is it challenging?” Zhou Wen read out the monster’s name when it appeared on the cube.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had heard of this Mythical creature before. It was considered one of the more famous Mythical creatures. It appeared in many myths.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen realized that Tyrant Behemoth’s name had lit up on the rankings. Orochi was challenging his Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Instantly, the entire Federation boiled over. After Tyrant Behemoth killed Chimera with a decisive victory, to have another Companion Beast challenge it was unexpected.</p>
<p>After all, Tyrant Behemoth was only ranked thirteenth, but according to analysis and speculation, its strength was ranked at least in the top five. It was clearly not worth it to challenge Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Now that someone was challenging it, it meant that it wasn’t just for the ranking. They had either found Tyrant Behemoth’s weakness or wanted to probe its true strength.</p>
<p>No matter what the outcome was, this battle would undoubtedly be a spectacle.</p>
<p>Furthermore, people were guessing whether Orochi, which had never been listed on the ranking, was from the Federation or overseas.</p>
<p>The intelligence network of the eight factions began their full machinery. They investigated the origins of Orochi, hoping to find its owner.</p>
<p>However, the final conclusion was that the chances of it being an overseas Companion Beast were higher.</p>
<p>On an island overseas, a youth was standing in front of a cube, staring intently at the screen.</p>
<p>“Why are you taking the risk to challenge Tyrant Behemoth? Your target should be Primordial Sword Immortal. Challenging Tyrant Behemoth will only expose the strength of Orochi ahead of time,” a middle-aged man walked over and said with a frown.</p>
<p>632 Orochi</p>
<p>The youth stared at the screen and said, “With the characteristics and skills of Orochi, it’s still unknown if it can defeat Primordial Immortal Sword. After all, Primordial Immortal Sword can split apart Death of the Underworld’s domain. Such destructive power happens to be the characteristics of Orochi. When Companion Beasts with the same characteristics meet, the stronger one will have an overwhelming advantage.”</p>
<p>“Do you think Orochi is no match for Primordial Immortal Sword?” the middle-aged man said unhappily.</p>
<p>“At the very least, I haven’t seen the possibility of it winning yet. Rather than leaving the final moment to chance, I might as well occupy a spot first. I can advance and defend. Even if I fail to challenge Primordial Sword Immortal in the end, I can still occupy one of the top spots,” the youth said.</p>
<p>“In that case, you should also challenge a Companion Beast ranked closer to the top. Tyrant Behemoth is only thirteenth, but its actual combat strength can be ranked in the top five.”</p>
<p>The youth said with a smile, “The competition for the top ten will definitely be very intense towards the end. Even if I get Orochi to use all its strength to ascend to the top five, not only will I expose all my strength, but I will still be challenged by the Federation in the end. Although Tyrant Behemoth is strong, from what I can see, Orochi should be able to restrain it. It won’t be that difficult to win. Furthermore, Tyrant Behemoth’s name has shaken the world. If I kill it now, others will view Orochi in a different light. When the time comes, I’ll rush into the top five. Those who dare challenge Orochi will have to think it through. How does their Companion Beast compare to Chimera or Tyrant Behemoth?”</p>
<p>“Do you have the confidence to easily defeat Tyrant Behemoth?” the middle-aged man asked after some thought.</p>
<p>“How can there be anything in this world with absolute certainty? However, during this period of time, I’ve repeatedly analyzed Tyrant Behemoth’s battle as well as the Tyrant Behemoth found in myths and legends. Without a doubt, it is a pure Strength-type Companion Beast. You should know very well that Orochi has the absolute advantage over such Companion Beasts,” the youth said.</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, then go ahead and do it. It’s also time for those fellows from the Federation to remember we exist. Let’s just treat it as an early heads up for them.” With that, the middle-aged man stopped objecting.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t immediately accept the challenge. Instead, he went online to search for information related to Orochi.</p>
<p>There was no available information regarding the dimensional creature, Orochi. There were only myths and legends.</p>
<p>There were many legends regarding Orochi. The most famous legend was that Orochi was a monster from Outcloud Country.</p>
<p>There were a few other legends, but they weren’t as famous as this. Zhou Wen felt that the Orochi in the arena was similar to this legendary monster.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s injuries hadn’t healed yet, so he said as he leaned there, looking at the screen, “Junior Brother, what are you hesitating for? Send your Tyrant Behemoth to kill that crappy snake.”</p>
<p>“I don’t plan on accepting the challenge. How’s your injury? If there’s nothing wrong with you, let’s head to the Endless Sea of Stars,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You’re giving up? Wouldn’t that mean giving up your ranking?” Liu Yun said in surprise.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter. This ranking isn’t my goal anyway.” Zhou Wen looked at Liu Yun and said, “Can you walk or not?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I have to walk even if it hurts. I have an uncomfortable feeling as long as that piece of paper is with you,” said Liu Yun as he forced himself to get up. He summoned an Epic Companion Beast that looked like a turtle, but it was bigger than an SUV.</p>
<p>He sprawled on the turtle’s back which ran as though it had burning wheels at its feet. It was surprisingly fast and very stable.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have any Companion Beasts that were especially suitable for riding. It was uncomfortable sitting on Six-Winged, so he chose to sit on the turtle’s back as well.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t plan on letting Tyrant Behemoth participate in the battle, but the West District’s media overwhelmingly supported Tyrant Behemoth, believing that it would definitely kill Orochi.</p>
<p>“How can an apocalyptic beast like Tyrant Behemoth be comparable to the likes of an overgrown snake?”</p>
<p>“It won’t take more than three minutes. Tyrant Behemoth will definitely defeat Orochi.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think Orochi can even last three minutes.”</p>
<p>The people in the West District believed that Tyrant Behemoth would win, but as the 72-hour countdown ticked by, they didn’t see Tyrant Behemoth choosing to answer the call of battle. People began to sing to a different tune.</p>
<p>There were even media reports that Tyrant Behemoth was no match for Orochi, which was why it didn’t dare accept the challenge.</p>
<p>Immediately, some media outlets objected. As a result, the major media outlets began arguing online. The West District citizens who supported Tyrant Behemoth began to split into two factions.</p>
<p>In the end, after 72 hours, Tyrant Behemoth didn’t choose to participate in the battle. This war of words ended with Tyrant Behemoth’s supporters turning silent in dejection.</p>
<p>Many people from the West District were very disappointed. They believed that Tyrant Behemoth shouldn’t have been afraid of battle and should fight to the death to defend the glory of the West District.</p>
<p>There were even rumors that pointed at the Family Clan of Gods and the Cape family, believing that Tyrant Behemoth was a Companion Beast of their two families. It was a disgrace to the West District to surrender without fighting.</p>
<p>The Cape family was the most wronged. Their Chimera had been swallowed by Tyrant Behemoth, so how could Tyrant Behemoth belong to their family? However, ordinary citizens didn’t know of this situation and included their family in their cussing.</p>
<p>In the end, the Cape family couldn’t withstand the pressure of public opinion. This greatly affected their reputation as a hero family. In the end, they took the initiative to meet the Family Clan of Gods and decided to take down Orochi.</p>
<p>In the beginning, they first sent an unknown Mythical Companion Beast to challenge Orochi, hoping to figure out its true strength.</p>
<p>However, it was easily defeated. Following that, the two families sent three Mythical Companion Beasts to challenge Orochi, but all of them failed. They were defeated by Orochi with overwhelming strength. One of the losers was Inferno Dragon.</p>
<p>It may have been a covetous probe at the beginning, but at this stage, the entire Federation knew that the two families were aiming to defeat Orochi.</p>
<p>However, the repeated failures only served to further infuriate the West District media. They blamed the two families for their inaction. They should have sent stronger Companion Beasts to fight and defeat Orochi to defend West District’s honor.</p>
<p>There were even some people from the West District who wanted Tyrant Behemoth to fight again to avenge their humiliation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Tyrant Behemoth wasn’t in the hands of the two West District families. Even if they wanted Tyrant Behemoth to fight, it was impossible.</p>
<p>The two families had their own plans. It was impossible for them to engage in an all-out war with Orochi at the moment, but they couldn’t ignore the reputation of the two families. Finally, the Cape family sent out an Angel Companion Beast, hoping to defeat Orochi.</p>
<p>633 The Federation is Incompetent</p>
<p>War Angel was a Mythical Companion Beast with golden wings. He wore golden armor and held a sword in one hand and a shield in the other. He was a Companion Beast with extremely powerful offensive and defensive abilities.</p>
<p>Orochi quickly accepted the challenge and appeared in the arena. This battle attracted a large number of spectators.</p>
<p>Because Orochi had won several consecutive battles and made Tyrant Behemoth retreat without a fight, it was placed in the limelight. It was so great that it was almost comparable to top Companion Beasts like Primordial Immortal Sword and Death of the Underworld.</p>
<p>However, its ranking remained at thirteen. It didn’t continue challenging upwards.</p>
<p>The moment Orochi appeared, its eight snake heads spewed out different powers—poison, flames, and smoke. Together with its mountainous form, it looked extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>War Angel raised the golden shield in his hand and formed a barrier of light, blocking the many forces outside the barrier. The wings on his back flapped as he instantly came in front of Orochi. The golden sword in his hand slashed at one of the snake heads with a resplendent and holy sword beam.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>A snake tail slammed into War Angel’s sword beam like a phantom. It shattered the sword beam and sent War Angel flying.</p>
<p>In terms of strength, War Angel was clearly no match for Orochi.</p>
<p>War Angel wasn’t injured. He raised his shield and sword and constantly circled Orochi while attacking, but it didn’t serve much purpose.</p>
<p>Although his shield could block Orochi’s attack, its sword beam was similarly unable to injure Orochi. Every strike was blocked, causing the battle to enter a stalemate.</p>
<p>The West District citizens naturally hoped for War Angel to win. As for the other districts, they were just watching the fun. This was because no one could confirm that Orochi was a Companion Beast from overseas.</p>
<p>As the battle continued, the golden wings on War Angel’s back suddenly turned into golden feathers that spread out and condensed towards the golden sword. The golden sword turned into a huge golden feather sword that slashed at Orochi with unparalleled light.</p>
<p>This strike was War Angel’s Wheel of Destiny, known as the End of War. It possessed unparalleled destructive power. The Cape family hoped to use the End of War to defeat Orochi.</p>
<p>Many people in the West District knew of the existence of War Angel. When they saw End of War, they were excited, imagining that War Angel was finally about to unleash its maximum strength.</p>
<p>Even people who didn’t know the might of End of War felt that this strike was invincible when they saw the golden sword beam that resembled divine punishment. Even if Orochi wasn’t killed, it would be severely injured.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, the West District citizen’s fantasy was shattered. Orochi’s tail struck the terrifying golden sword beam with a cold beam.</p>
<p>The golden sword beam was sliced apart along with the feather blade. Even the shield was split in half. Thankfully, War Angel retreated quickly, or his body might have been split in half.</p>
<p>At this stage, War Angel’s owner didn’t dare continue. He chose to admit defeat and leave the battlefield. If he continued fighting, he probably wouldn’t even have the chance to admit defeat.</p>
<p>The people from West District fell silent while the people from the other districts gloated.</p>
<p>“The angels in the West District are nothing much after all. They can’t even defeat a snake.”</p>
<p>“How embarrassing. The two hero families can’t even deal with a snake. They were even beaten up so badly.”</p>
<p>“Thankfully, Tyrant Behemoth was smart and didn’t accept the challenge. Otherwise, it might have been sliced into two if it didn’t escape as quickly as War Angel.”</p>
<p>As for the West District, they were in a frenzy. The Internet was abuzz. There were people requesting Tyrant Behemoth to take the stage again, but there were also people who wanted the two families to send stronger Companion Beasts. Such a failure was intolerable.</p>
<p>As for the pessimists of the West District, they believed that Orochi was invincible.</p>
<p>The two families were in a difficult position, but to send a top-notch Companion Beast into battle now would only expose their strength and affect their plan to achieve first place.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>When Liu Yun and Zhou Wen arrived at a city closest to the desert, they saw the video of Orochi fighting War Angel. Liu Yun exclaimed, “What a powerful, destructive force. The tail of Orochi is like an invincible divine weapon. It can even shatter End of War. It’s terrifying. It was right for you not to accept the challenge back then. This power is the nemesis of all pure Strength-type Companion Beasts.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen said, “In myths, there’s a divine sword in the tail of Orochi. It’s an infallible weapon. That should be Orochi’s most powerful trump card.”</p>
<p>After watching Orochi’s battle, Zhou Wen felt more at ease. Orochi was indeed powerful, but it was impossible for it to defeat Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>The destructive power of Golden Overlord Sword was in no way inferior to Orochi. Its attack power was augmented by Golden Sword Aura, Unstoppable, and Ever-Victorious. Yet, it could only injure Tyrant Behemoth when it didn’t use Absolute Strength. Once it used Absolute Strength, the Golden Overlord Sword’s offensive power could only cause a faint sword mark on Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Of course, that was under Zhou Wen’s deliberate act. In fact, Tyrant Behemoth wouldn’t even give Golden Overlord Sword a chance to hit it when it used Absolute Strength.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there were too many people in the city. Zhou Wen didn’t wish to be too ostentatious or he would have gotten Tyrant Behemoth to finish Orochi.</p>
<p>The two of them left the city and continued heading towards the desert. Now, all Zhou Wen wanted was to quickly reach the Endless Sea of Stars and see if he could download a game dungeon.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>While the two families in the West District were hesitating, Orochi, which had not challenged anything of a higher rank, made a move. It challenged fourth-place, Ice Elemental Sprite Queen.</p>
<p>It was a Mythical Companion Beast that belonged to the Ultimate Family Clan. It was currently in fourth place, only inferior to Primordial Sword Immortal, Death of the Underworld, and Fairy Immortal Gu.</p>
<p>Legend had it that Fairy Immortal Gu was from the Dugu family, but up to now, no one had confirmed it.</p>
<p>Ice Elemental Sprite Queen was proficient in ice power and could freeze everything. As for the Wheel of Destiny—Extreme Cold—legend had it that it was the power closest to absolute zero.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Orochi seemed to have very high resistance to ice. When the entire combat arena was frozen, it actually shattered the ice and slashed out with its tail, almost killing Ice Elemental Sprite Queen.</p>
<p>The owner of Ice Elemental Sprite Queen had no choice but to admit defeat. However, after that, Orochi did something unimaginable.</p>
<p>Orochi’s eight heads spewed out eight different powers including ice, fire, and smoke at the same time, condensing eight words in the void.</p>
<p>“The Federation is incompetent. The heroes are shameless.”</p>
<p>Instantly, the entire Federation erupted with rage. To say such words made it very obvious. Orochi was undoubtedly an overseas Companion Beast.</p>
<p>This time, it wasn’t just the West District. The entire Federation’s Four Districts were filled with indignation.</p>
<h3 id='chapter634'>Chapter 634 sandstorm</h3>
<p>“Nao, well done. Since the Orochi has already revealed its strength, let’s maximize its effects and expose the Federation more,” the middle-aged man said to the young man standing beside Orochi.</p>
<p>The youth turned around. She was wearing a Samurai outfit and her hair was tied up. She looked like an ordinary woman without a calm or heroic aura.</p>
<p>“You should call me by my full name, Uesugi Nao,” Uesugi Nao said.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man’s expression stiffened slightly as he continued with a cold expression, “However, it’s best you know your limits. It’s fine to gather information, but Orochi must not be lost.”</p>
<p>“I naturally know what to do,” Uesugi Nao said indifferently without looking at the middle-aged man.</p>
<p>“I hope you really know what should be done.” The middle-aged man snorted and left.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The entire Federation was discussing how to defeat Orochi and teach those demons overseas a lesson. They wanted them to know how powerful the Federation was.</p>
<p>Now, the pressure wasn’t only on the Cape family and the Family Clan of Gods. The other families also felt the pressure.</p>
<p>Xia Dongyue looked at the Xia family’s analysis of Orochi and said, “Orochi has multiple attributes and has a high resistance to ice. Its strength is extremely strong. The most terrifying thing is its tail’s destructive power. It can slice through almost everything. The owner of this Orochi is very smart, choosing Ice Elemental Sprite Queen that Orochi has a restraining effect on. This won them fourth place. While enjoying this high-ranking, they prevent Death of the Underworld that is best at restraining Orochi from challenging it because of its higher ranking.”</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue said, “To deal with a Companion Beast like Orochi, Brother Chuan’s Companion Beast is most suitable. However, he went to the Southern Wilderness with Dugu Ge and Zhang Chunqiu. I’m afraid he won’t be able to return anytime soon.”</p>
<p>“No rush. Someone will be even more anxious than us.” Xia Dongyue smiled.</p>
<p>The person Xia Dongyue was referring to was naturally the Cape family and the Family Clan of Gods. It meant nothing if they were defeated by other hero families.</p>
<p>However, no one was more anxious than them when they were humiliated by the overseas demons.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Liu Yun had already entered the desert. This place was even more terrifying than Zhou Wen imagined.</p>
<p>Due to the influence of the dimensional storms, the difference between day and night temperatures became even greater. The temperature in the day was nearly 80-90°C. It was almost enough to roast a human. Yet, it was literally freezing at night.</p>
<p>Furthermore, terrifying sandstorms often appeared. According to Liu Yun, the desert’s terrain would change with each sandstorm. Dimensional zones would even appear after the change.</p>
<p>It was very likely that they would find themselves in a dimensional zone after a sandstorm.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. With me around, I can avoid danger in the desert. I won’t lose my way, nor will I end up inside a dimensional zone because of the sandstorm.” Liu Yun’s injuries were almost healed. He sat on the turtle’s back and introduced the desert to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Although the desert temperature couldn’t damage Zhou Wen’s body, he felt somewhat uncomfortable. Even with an umbrella shielding him, he still felt extremely hot.</p>
<p>The weather in the desert changed without warning. It was burning under the scorching sun a moment ago, and in the next second, black clouds appeared in the sky. In just a moment, they covered half the sky.</p>
<p>The sun was covered up and the sky darkened.</p>
<p>“Oh no, it’s a sandstorm. Why are we encountering a sandstorm here?” Liu Yun’s expression changed.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that you wouldn’t enter a dimensional zone even if you encountered a sandstorm?” Zhou Wen asked Liu Yun.</p>
<p>After the dimensional storms, sandstorms became especially terrifying. However, the power of the sandstorm wasn’t enough to threaten the safety of Epic experts. What they were most afraid of was the sandstorm sweeping up dimensional zones and causing them to find themselves inside one.</p>
<p>“Under normal circumstances, there shouldn’t be any problems.” Liu Yun clearly didn’t sound confident.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen could tell that Liu Yun lacked confidence, there was nothing he could do since he had already come so far.</p>
<p>The black sandstorm arrived in the blink of an eye. The terrifying storm had caught up to them and swept them into a swath of black sand that blotted out the sky.</p>
<p>Liu Yun summoned a wind-elemental Companion Beast and transformed into a windmill. It stood on the turtle’s head.</p>
<p>Strangely, the terrifying sandstorm blew at the windmill, causing it to spin faster and faster. However, the sand around them seemed to be absorbed by the windmill, preventing it from affecting the two people on the turtle’s back.</p>
<p>In the sandstorm, nothing could be seen. Even Truth Listener was affected, reducing its range.</p>
<p>“Did you hear anything?” Zhou Wen suddenly asked Liu Yun one hour into the turtle’s journey in the sandstorm.</p>
<p>“No, did you hear anything?” Liu Yun immediately became nervous. He pricked up his ears to listen, but he couldn’t hear anything.</p>
<p>“I seem to hear a woman crying, but I can’t hear it clearly,” Zhou Wen said to Liu Yun as he listened attentively.</p>
<p>“A woman crying? Listen carefully. Are you sure that’s right?” Liu Yun’s expression turned ugly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen focused his attention and continued listening, but he couldn’t seem to hear the woman’s cries. After listening for a while, he didn’t hear the same sound again.</p>
<p>“I knew it. You must have heard wrongly.” Liu Yun heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Zhou Wen shake his head.</p>
<p>The terrifying sandstorm blew for more than ten hours. By the time the sandstorm passed, it was already the morning of the next day. The sun had just risen, and the temperature wasn’t too high yet. The surrounding air seemed to have improved significantly, and there was a moist smell.</p>
<p>“See? I told you that with me around, you can freely enter the desert. It’s impossible for you to enter a dimensional zone,” said Liu Yun smugly.</p>
<p>As Liu Yun spoke, he stood up and looked into the distance. His expression suddenly froze.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that something was amiss and stood up. He traced Liu Yun’s gaze and saw an ancient city appear in the desert ahead.</p>
<p>The ancient city was made of a yellow jade-like stone. It shimmered under the sunlight like the morning sun.</p>
<p>The architectural style of the ancient city was very strange. It was different from the ancient cities in Zhou Wen’s hometown. The city gates and roofs used large numbers of arches.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen narrowed his eyes and carefully sized it up. He saw that above the city gates were the words ‘Netherworld City.’</p>
<p>This name didn’t sound auspicious. Zhou Wen turned to look at Liu Yun and asked, “Do we need to pass by Netherworld City to reach the Endless Sea of Stars?”</p>
<p>However, Liu Yun didn’t answer Zhou Wen. As though he had gone mad, he ordered the turtle to change directions and run at full speed.</p>
<p>However, not long after running, they saw the ancient city that resembled yellow jade appear in front of them. On it were the words ‘Netherworld City’. It looked like the ancient city they had just seen.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Zhou Wen sized up Netherworld City, but his eyes suddenly lit up. This was because he saw a tiny symbol beside the words—a tiny palm symbol.</p>
<h3 id='chapter635'>Chapter 635 Netherworld City</h3>
<p>“Death Valley, Netherworld City, the Endless Sea of Stars, and Paradise Mountain. These are the four most terrifying dimensional zones that appeared after the transformation of the Taklamakan Desert. If humans enter, it’s highly likely that they won’t be able to survive,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“Then why are you taking me to the Endless Sea of Stars?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“I’ve entered the Endless Sea of Stars before, and I know how to leave. As long as I don’t venture too deep, there won’t be any danger. However, I’ve only heard of Netherworld City and have never seen it before. I heard from the people in the desert that Netherworld City can only be seen at certain times. Many people might not even see it once in their entire lives in the desert, but who knew that it would be such a coincidence for us to encounter it? Is the thing you planted on me still there?” Liu Yun asked Zhou Wen suspiciously.</p>
<p>“Do I look like an idiot? I wouldn’t want to die with you, right?” Zhou Wen curled his lips.</p>
<p>Liu Yun thought that it made sense. If they entered the desert together, Zhou Wen wouldn’t be able to escape the same fate if he died from encountering Netherworld City.</p>
<p>“What kind of place is Netherworld City?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I’ve only heard that none of the people who have seen Netherworld City can return alive. I didn’t believe it in the past, but this city is indeed strange. I’ve already changed directions, and it’s impossible I backtracked; yet, here we are, seeing it again.” Liu Yun’s expression didn’t look too good.</p>
<p>“Since we can’t shake it off, let’s head over and take a look.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he jumped off the turtle’s back. After adhering the Substitute Talisman to himself, he summoned Six-Winged Guardian Dragon and allowed it to appear on his back in its companion form.</p>
<p>He wore Truth Listener the entire time. He directly summoned Tyrant Behemoth and made it scout ahead.</p>
<p>Liu Yun knew that they couldn’t hide from Netherworld City after encountering it, so he decided to take a look first.</p>
<p>He summoned Genie and Orange Cat. He wore the pair of bracers and summoned a few Epic Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>After summoning, he saw that Zhou Wen was still summoning Companion Beasts. Not only did he summon the Golden Overlord Sword, but he also had a Golden Battle God Halberd floating beside him.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, don’t tell me you’re in the same industry as me?” Liu Yun looked at Zhou Wen’s Mythical Companion Beasts and felt like he had wasted all his years.</p>
<p>He used to think that he was doing pretty well. Among his peers, even the geniuses of the six families might not have as many Mythical Companion Beasts as he did. However, compared to Zhou Wen, he immediately felt like he was a country bumpkin.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored him and summoned some Vajra Mallas that served as cannon fodder. Due to the intense sunlight here, the Poison Bats’ combat strength would be greatly weakened, so Zhou Wen didn’t use them.</p>
<p>A few Vajra Mallas scouted ahead. Zhou Wen and Liu Yun followed behind as they headed for Netherworld City.</p>
<p>Netherworld City’s huge doors were tightly shut. The doors were carved from yellow jade. On each of the two doors, there was a tiny ghost image which looked very sinister.</p>
<p>When they arrived in front of the city gate, nothing happened. While Liu Yun sized up the city gate, Zhou Wen took out his phone and snapped a picture of the tiny palm symbol beside the words ‘Netherworld City.’</p>
<p>The palm of the tiny palm symbol didn’t hold the symbol of Netherworld City, but a ring. He did not know what it meant.</p>
<p>After taking a picture on his phone, Zhou Wen immediately entered the download interface, making him feel a lot more at ease.</p>
<p>As long as he could download the map, he could explore the secret of Netherworld City in-game. No matter how strange it was, there was no need to be afraid.</p>
<p>With the combat strength of Zhou Wen’s current Companion Beast lineup, he should be able to clear anything unless he encountered an unreasonable existence like The Thearch.</p>
<p>Before he could finish downloading the map, he suddenly heard a strange voice coming from the gates of Netherworld City. “Welcome to Netherworld City.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked in the direction of the voice and saw that it came from the two ghost faces on the door.</p>
<p>The two ghost faces revealed a strange smile as they stared at Zhou Wen and Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Liu Yun and Zhou Wen looked warily at the two ghost faces on the door, not daring to act rashly.</p>
<p>“Before entering the city, there are three ironclad rules you must not violate. Take heed,” the ghost face on the left said.</p>
<p>“First, murderers in Netherworld City will die,” the ghost face on the right said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Second, anyone whose two feet leave the ground will die,” the ghost face on the left said.</p>
<p>“Third, kill one person for every day you are inside the city, or you will have to commit suicide,” the ghost face on the right said.</p>
<p>“Welcome to the city,” the two ghost faces said the last sentence in unison as the door to Netherworld City opened.</p>
<p>“What kind of bullsh*t ironclad rules are those? The first rule clearly states that we are not allowed to kill. The third rule says that we have to kill one person a day. It’s completely bullsh*t,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>However, the two ghost faces had already closed their eyes as though they were asleep. They ignored Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Netherworld City, but the city was blinding. He couldn’t see anything.</p>
<p>Truth Listener’s ability couldn’t hear any sound in Netherworld City. Zhou Wen did not know what force had affected it.</p>
<p>“Let’s not enter the city now.” Zhou Wen planned on entering the city in-game after the map was downloaded.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen soon realized that it wasn’t up to them whether they entered the city.</p>
<p>A raging fire burned outside the city, as though the entire desert had turned into burning hell. The Vajra Mallas beside them were immediately burned to ashes when they touched the flames.</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>It was the same for one of Liu Yun’s Epic pets. When it touched a spark, it immediately burned and was reduced to ashes in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Seeing the flames rapidly reach the city gates, it was obvious that they were forced to enter the city. They didn’t have any other choice. If they didn’t wish to die in the sea of flames, they could only enter the city.</p>
<p>“Let’s enter the city now.” Liu Yun saw that the fire was about to reach his feet. Genie, who was a fire-elemental Companion Beast, was helpless against the flames. All he could do was shout and charge into the city gates.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only follow by carefully charging into the city.</p>
<p>At the instant they passed through the city gates, they realized that the Companion Beasts they summoned had automatically returned to their bodies, turning into tattoos.</p>
<p>It was a little different from what they had imagined. The city wasn’t hell, but a seemingly normal street. There were all sorts of strange buildings on both sides of the street.</p>
<p>Strangely, there were humanoid creatures standing on the streets. There were only a few of them.</p>
<p>As far as their eyes could see, there were about twenty to thirty people on the long street. However, those people were very strange. All of them stood motionless, as though their feet had been nailed to the ground.</p>
<h3 id='chapter636'>Chapter 636 Strange Street</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen attempted to summon Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, but he couldn’t. It was as though he was restrained by some kind of nomological force.</p>
<p>The few Companion Beasts he had summoned previously had already automatically turned back into tattoos. He couldn’t summon any of them. Only Truth Listener remained in its earring form and wasn’t sealed.</p>
<p>“Can you summon your Companion Beasts?” Zhou Wen asked Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“No, none of my Companion Beasts can be summoned.” Liu Yun shook his head with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>Without Companion Beasts, he and Zhou Wen were only at the Epic stage. It would be difficult to resolve many matters.</p>
<p>Liu Yun took two steps as he spoke, hoping to see if he could use any Essence Energy Skills. However, after taking a step, he realized something strange happening beneath his feet. He immediately stopped.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also looked at the stone slab beneath Liu Yun’s feet.</p>
<p>At a glance, the entire street was filled with such stone slabs. Every stone slab was uniform—about 40 centimeters wide by 60 centimeters long. At the end of the stone path was a stone staircase. At the end of the stone steps was a strange building that looked similar to a memorial steele.</p>
<p>Just now, when Liu Yun took a step, the stone slab he stepped on lit up immediately, emitting a faint light. It made the originally grayish-blue stone slab become crystalline like jade.</p>
<p>And on the stone slab, a faint light condensed into a number: 364.</p>
<p>“Do you feel anything wrong with your body?” Zhou Wen asked Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Liu Yun shook his head. “Apart from not being able to summon Companion Beasts, there aren’t any other problems. I’ll take another step.”</p>
<p>With that said, Liu Yun took another step. With that step, Liu Yun’s foot stepped onto the stone slab beside him. After his foot lifted off the stone slab, the light immediately vanished. The stone slab he was stepping on now suffused a faint glow as numbers appeared on it.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t 364 this time, but 363.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, the number should decrease by one with every tile. But what does this number mean?” Liu Yun frowned.</p>
<p>“I have a very bad feeling about this. Those people are standing motionless on the streets. The stone slabs beneath their feet are also glowing. I believe it’s not that they don’t want to move, but they don’t dare to because of the numbers,” Zhou Wen said as he took a step forward. He wanted to verify his guess.</p>
<p>The city gates had already closed. Zhou Wen took a step and walked to the stone slab in front of him. Indeed, the stone slab lit up as numbers appeared. It was 365.</p>
<p>“That’s not fair. Why was my number 364 when I took a step? Yet, you’re one step ahead of me?” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored him and took another step back. The stone slab beneath his feet lit up as the numbers turned into 364.</p>
<p>“I reckon that no matter where we go now, the number will decrease by one. The ghost face said that both our feet can’t leave the ground, or we will be killed. In other words, it’s impossible for us to fly over. We can only walk across the stone path.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at the people ahead and said, “Do you think the numbers on the stone slab represent our remaining steps? If they’re used up, maybe something very bad will happen.”</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, it’s indeed very possible.” Liu Yun agreed with Zhou Wen’s view. After some thought, he said, “What will happen if we stay here forever?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but I believe the dimensional creatures in this city wouldn’t make us stand here forever, ” Zhou Wen answered very quickly. Everything in Netherworld City was too strange, so he couldn’t guess what would happen next.</p>
<p>The two of them stood there, looking at each other. Neither of them dared to move.</p>
<p>“Just standing here won’t do. Why don’t we go over and ask the people in front of us and see what’s going on here?” Liu Yun said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Alright, you can go over and ask them,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>Liu Yun wanted Zhou Wen to go, but he had made it clear that he wanted him to do it. Therefore, neither of them moved.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t idle. He tried summoning his Companion Beasts one by one to see if there were any other Companion Beasts that responded to his summoning other than Truth Listener.</p>
<p>In such a place, having an additional Companion Beast meant an additional chance of survival.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon… No response… Golden Overlord Sword… No response… Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General… No response… Demonic Neonate… Zhou Wen was delighted. Demonic Neonate had actually given him a response. He could sense Demonic Neonate’s consciousness and she was waiting for his summoning.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate can be summoned! Zhou Wen didn’t summon her. He wanted to determine the situation first.</p>
<p>He tried all the Companion Beasts, but only Truth Listener and Demonic Neonate responded to him. There was nothing from Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>After attempting to summon all his Companion Beasts, Zhou Wen began switching his Essence Energy Arts, hoping to see if his Life Providences and Life Souls were useful here.</p>
<p>Life Providences and Life Souls were normal and weren’t affected. Apart from not being able to summon Companion Beasts, everything else was the same as usual.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen switched to the Dao Sutra, the jade infant actually opened his eyes. A treasure glow emitted from his body as a terrifying taboo power seeped into his body like a mighty river. In just a few seconds, the jade infant was nearly blasted apart by the terrifying taboo power. Zhou Wen was so frightened that he hurriedly deactivated Gods Retreat.</p>
<p>What a terrifying taboo power! For that split instant, Zhou Wen felt the connection with his Companion Beast again.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was impossible for Gods Retreat to last for a long period of time. It was basically impossible to use such a short period of time for combat.</p>
<p>The taboo power of Netherworld City is even more terrifying than the taboo power on Jade Emperor Peak. It’s no wonder no one from Netherworld City can return. I’m afraid it’s a near-death situation this time. Zhou Wen pondered.</p>
<p>However, there was too little useful information at the moment. He had no idea how he could leave Netherworld City.</p>
<p>Liu Yun opened his mouth and shouted. He wanted to catch the attention of the people on the street. Liu Yun’s voice was very loud. With his volume, even if he stood outside the city, one should be able to hear him.</p>
<p>However, the people on the streets didn’t seem to hear his voice at all. They ignored them and continued about their own business.</p>
<p>“Stop shouting. They probably can’t hear you,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“How do you know they can’t hear?” Liu Yun asked.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you notice? We’ve been standing here for so long. Have you heard any sound on this street?” Zhou Wen pointed at the long street.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was slightly taken aback as he realized that the street was indeed a little strange. Apart from his and Zhou Wen’s voices, there wasn’t a single sound.</p>
<p>Although most people on the streets didn’t move, there were also some people moving around. They could even see them opening their mouths to speak, but they couldn’t hear a single sound. The entire street seemed to have been set to silent mode.</p>
<h3 id='chapter637'>Chapter 637 Reason of Death</h3>
<p>“That’s not right. If Netherworld City is really muted, why are we able to hear each other’s voices? Could it be that it’s not forbidden for sound to spread, but that sound can only be transmitted within a certain range?” Liu Yun thought for a moment before saying.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, the possibility is very high. In other words, we have to walk over to communicate with those people,” Zhou Wen said as he looked at the people on the street.</p>
<p>“That’s crazy. The person closest to us is 163 stone slabs away from us. Even if sound can be transmitted within a certain range, meaning that we don’t have to walk right up to him, we still have to take at least a hundred steps.” Liu Yun counted the stone slabs on the street.</p>
<p>“Let’s try walking. Even if we stand here without moving, the third rule might still kill us,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“What a bullsh*t ironclad rule. If the ironclad rule is really effective, wouldn’t we die without a doubt? Killing people means death. Even if we don’t kill people, we will die. I think there must be something wrong with the three rules,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“Murderers will die. If people aren’t killed in a day, one can only commit suicide. What method is there to satisfy these two conditions at the same time without having to die?” Zhou Wen frowned in thought.</p>
<p>Liu Yun looked at Zhou Wen and said, “I have an idea. If I push you out now and your number drops to zero, you might die because of me. It can be said that I killed you, but I didn’t personally kill you. Does this count as fulfilling two conditions at the same time?”</p>
<p>“That’s one way to look at it.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.</p>
<p>However, Liu Yun shook his head and said, “This method is useless. Even if I kill you, I’ll only live one more day. The cost is not proportional to the rewards.”</p>
<p>“Now, our understanding of Netherworld City is limited. Let’s head over and ask the people ahead. Perhaps we can obtain some useful information,” Zhou Wen said as he prepared to walk forward.</p>
<p>“Don’t walk yet. Let’s think of a way. Perhaps we can come up with a way to resolve the problem. For example, you can carry me on your back. That way, we might only need to expend one person’s steps,” shouted Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“If I carry you, won’t your feet leave the ground?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I’m just giving an example. There might be other methods,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“Then take your time to think about it. Tell me when you think of it.” Zhou Wen probed as he walked forward.</p>
<p>On the same stone slab, no matter how he moved, the number wouldn’t change. However, as long as he moved to the stone slab beside him, the number would change.</p>
<p>If he crossed two stone slabs with one step, the number would decrease by two.</p>
<p>“You are already walking. What’s the point of me telling you?” Liu Yun gritted his teeth and followed.</p>
<p>The two of them watched as the number on the stone slabs kept decreasing. They were also extremely nervous. No one knew what would happen after the number dropped to zero.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen walked, he looked at his phone. Netherworld City was still downloading, but it hadn’t finished.</p>
<p>This was because he didn’t know when the game could be downloaded. If the download took more than a day, Zhou Wen might just be waiting for death if he didn’t do anything.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen decided to do his best with what he had. If his phone didn’t work, he might still have a chance of survival.</p>
<p>After walking on about seven or eight stone slabs, Zhou Wen suddenly had a bad feeling the moment he stepped onto the next slab. It was as though something was different.</p>
<p>This time, not only did the stone slab show a number, but there were also words.</p>
<p>Cause of death: Death by blades.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood motionless as his body tensed up, ready to release his strength at any moment.</p>
<p>Liu Yun also felt that something was amiss. He stopped in front of Zhou Wen and asked him, “What happened?”</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could answer, he heard a bang. Not far in front of him, a warrior wrapped in armor appeared with a blade in hand.</p>
<p>After appearing, he slashed at Zhou Wen without a word. The black saber beam instantly appeared in front of him, as fast as an illusion.</p>
<p>Clang! Zhou Wen drew his Bamboo Blade and slashed at the black-armored warrior.</p>
<p>The black-armored warrior’s strength was much weaker than Zhou Wen’s. He was sent flying, but he wasn’t injured. Zhou Wen could tell that he was an Epic dimensional creature, not a human.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t move, but the black-armored warrior didn’t have such restrictions. He rapidly moved and slashed from all directions, hoping to slay Zhou Wen by his blade.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen brandished his saber in response to the battle, but he could only stand where he was.</p>
<p>All this while, Zhou Wen had focused on practicing his movement techniques. But now, he couldn’t move at all. He was a little unused to it. However, his realm, reaction, consciousness, and technique remained ever-present. It wasn’t difficult for him to block the black-armored warrior’s attacks.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was too close to Zhou Wen and was also affected by the black-armored warrior. The black-armored warrior even slashed at him. Liu Yun could only take two steps back to prevent himself from being injured in the battle.</p>
<p>However, with his retreat, his number also decreased. He couldn’t help but feel depressed.</p>
<p>It’s clearly a stone slab that I’ve already reached, but the number still gets reduced when I return to it. Damn it. Liu Yun cursed inwardly.</p>
<p>However, when he saw Zhou Wen being constantly attacked by the black-armored warrior, he gloated in delight. “Junior Brother, your saber techniques aren’t bad. If you could move, ten black-armored warriors wouldn’t even make you break a sweat. What a pity.”</p>
<p>“Even if I can’t move, killing him isn’t difficult. However, if I kill him, it’s impossible to predict what will happen next,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Liu Yun nodded when he heard that. “This black-armored warrior should be considered one of the top existences at the Epic stage. His movement techniques and saber techniques are very powerful. His strength is slightly lacking, but he’s first-rate. The first appearance might be at the Epic stage, but if the second one is at the Mythical stage, we would definitely die considering how we can’t use our Companion Beasts or move as we please.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I’m referring to. I’m thinking if this black-armored warrior is considered a human? If I kill him, wouldn’t that breach the first rule?” Zhou Wen added.</p>
<p>After Liu Yun heard that, his expression turned serious. “If he’s considered a human, then we really don’t have a way out. Killing him means death. If we don’t kill him, we’ll be constantly attacked. Once our stamina is exhausted, we’ll die.”</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, Liu Yun continued, “I don’t think that he comes under the ironclad rules. Otherwise, there’s no way for us to live.”</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, Netherworld City doesn’t plan on giving us a way out,” Zhou Wen said coldly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s mind raced. The black-armored warrior definitely had to be killed. It was impossible for him to continue fighting him like this. However, he couldn’t kill him casually. He needed to be prepared.</p>
<p>The black-armored warrior appeared behind Zhou Wen like a ghost. He was already very close to him, but Zhou Wen suddenly turned around and slashed out with his Bamboo Blade.</p>
<p>Before the black-armored warrior’s saber could land, his saber had already sliced the black-armored warrior in half.</p>
<h3 id='chapter638'>Chapter 638 Horror</h3>
<p>“Are you alright?” Liu Yun looked at Zhou Wen nervously. He was really worried that Zhou Wen would die.If Zhou Wen were to die just like that, he would likely suffer the same fate. He naturally didn’t wish for Zhou Wen to die.“I’m fine.” Zhou Wen sheathed his Bamboo Blade and shook his head.</p>
<p>At the instant he struck out to kill the black-armored warrior, Zhou Wen switched to Gods Retreat before killing it.</p>
<p>The jade infant absorbed a large amount of taboo power and nearly exploded. However, it was about the same as before. There were no abnormal fluctuations. From the looks of it, killing the black-armored warrior wasn’t considered murder.</p>
<p>Of course, this was only Zhou Wen’s guess. Perhaps the taboo power fluctuations from murder wasn’t obvious.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked down at the black-armored warrior’s corpse. His corpse was rapidly disintegrating as a crystal dropped. It was an Essence Energy Skill Crystal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his palm and sucked it over. The crystal reached Zhou Wen’s hand and he used his phone to snap a picture. It was indeed an Epic Essence Energy Skill Crystal.</p>
<p>Blade Executioner Crystal: Epic</p>
<p>With the Blade Executioner dead, the words on the stone slab beneath Zhou Wen’s feet vanished.</p>
<p>“Do you still want to continue walking? If we encounter a Mythical creature, we will probably be doomed,” said Liu Yun with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that it was a viable possibility. He wouldn’t believe that there were no Mythical creatures in such a strange dimensional zone.</p>
<p>He looked at his phone. The game was still downloading, and there wasn’t any indication of the progress. He didn’t know when it would finish downloading.</p>
<p>“Let’s continue,” Zhou Wen said as he bit his lip. A day was very short. If they couldn’t untie the dead knot caused by the three ironclad rules, they would probably die.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen still had Truth Listener and Demonic Neonate to use. Even if he encountered Mythical creatures, he wasn’t powerless against them.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was still somewhat worried. He didn’t know if Companion Beasts would be affected by the ironclad rules of Netherworld City. If they were affected as well, they would die if they weren’t summoned with their feet touching the ground. That would be tragic.</p>
<p>But now that things had come to this, he had to fight for his survival. All he could do was walk forward.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, go ahead. I’ll follow behind you. Since you wish to scout the way, I can help you from behind if you encounter danger,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>There was nothing wrong with what Liu Yun said. Furthermore, Zhou Wen hadn’t pinned his hopes on him at all, so he continued walking forward. However, this time, Zhou Wen walked even slower and was even more careful.</p>
<p>Liu Yun waited for Zhou Wen to take a few steps before stepping on the same stone slabs he took to prevent any accidents from happening.</p>
<p>The only thing that worried Liu Yun was if the black-armored warrior that Zhou Wen had killed would appear when he stepped onto the same stone slab.</p>
<p>Although he was worried, Liu Yun was still prepared to take the same path. He wanted to see if the black-armored warrior would appear again. That would give him a better idea for the remaining journey.</p>
<p>However, before Liu Yun reached the black-armored warrior’s stone slab, something went wrong.</p>
<p>He stepped on a stone slab that Zhou Wen had stepped on before. The stone slab lit up as a few words appeared.</p>
<p>Cause of death: Horror</p>
<p>“F*ck, what the hell is this? You clearly stepped on it just now. Wasn’t it fine?” Liu Yun tightened his nerves and looked around.</p>
<p>He didn’t know what horror was. The slab that Zhou Wen had stepped on previously clearly wrote ‘Death by blades.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned his head and saw the words beneath Liu Yun’s feet. He said with a heavy expression, “From the looks of it, the problematic stone slabs aren’t in fixed spots. They randomly appear or someone is controlling them. Even if there’s a pattern, we don’t know what it is.”</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, I think it’s best if we don’t meet again in the future. Before meeting you, I lived a happy life. However, ever since I met you, I haven’t had a good day. I might even lose my life here. Promise me, if we can survive this time, we won’t meet again, alright?” Liu Yun said with a bitter face.</p>
<p>“When you take me to the Endless Sea of Stars, we won’t meet again,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You still want to go to the Endless Sea of Stars when we are already in this situation… Ah…” As Liu Yun spoke, he suddenly felt a chill run down his neck.</p>
<p>A dagger seemed to have appeared out of thin air and stuck to his neck. The blade had already touched his skin.</p>
<p>Liu Yun turned pale with fright, but his reaction was really fast. Almost at the same time the blade appeared, he quickly leaned back, but his feet seemed to be nailed to the ground. He remained motionless.</p>
<p>The dagger slashed across Liu Yun’s face, slicing off a portion of his hair. Liu Yun broke out into a cold sweat.</p>
<p>However, the dagger vanished after the slash. If not for the fact that half of Liu Yun’s hair had been cut off and there was a faint bloody mark on his neck, he would have thought that it was just an illusion.</p>
<p>Liu Yun listened attentively, but he couldn’t hear the sound of the dagger at all. There was no wind in the air.</p>
<p>This is indeed horrifying. I would rather meet the black-armored warrior… Liu Yun felt depressed, but he focused his mind and didn’t dare relax.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the dagger appeared at Liu Yun’s waist and stabbed at his waist.</p>
<p>Liu Yun immediately dodged to the side. His clothes were pierced, but he still managed to dodge.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched from the side as the dagger constantly appeared. It was like a ghost whose trajectory he couldn’t figure out. Every time it appeared, it was as though it had teleported.</p>
<p>When it vanished, Truth Listener couldn’t hear its location.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s skills were extraordinary. He managed to dodge the various attacks of the dagger time and time again. His body made all sorts of unimaginable poses. At most, he would lift one foot from the ground, never two at the same time. There were certain poses that even a professional acrobat might not be able to do.</p>
<p>“Senior Brother, your movement technique is pretty good. Where did you learn it?” Zhou Wen asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“You’re still gloating at me despite the situation. Hurry up and help me think of a way to deal with this fellow,” Liu Yun said gloomily.</p>
<p>“Since you have the ability to dodge, find an opportunity to slash it. Perhaps you can slice it apart with one strike,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You make it sound simple. How would I know that I would enter such a crappy place? I usually use Companion Beasts, so I don’t have any ordinary weapons,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“You should have said so earlier. I have a weapon. I can rent it out to you,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Cut the crap. Give it to me quickly.” Liu Yun dodged the dagger’s attack and shouted at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“How much will you be paying for rent?” Zhou Wen said in a relaxed manner when he saw that he wasn’t in much danger.</p>
<p>“You can charge however much you want. Junior Brother, can’t you be a little more humane in times like this?” Liu Yun felt like crying.</p>
<p>“Tell me first, what movement technique is that?” Zhou Wen was especially interested in movement techniques. Liu Yun’s movement technique wasn’t as fast as Zhou Wen’s, but his body could make all sorts of strange poses. It was something that ordinary humans couldn’t accomplish. It was definitely a special Essence Energy Skill.</p>
<h3 id='chapter639'>Chapter 639 Fire Burning</h3>
<p>“This is a combination of contortion, movement technique, and bone-contraction. It’s not a simple Essence Energy Skill. If you want to learn it, I’ll teach you slowly later,” said Liu Yun anxiously. “Give me the blade quickly.”</p>
<p>“Take it.” Zhou Wen took out his Orchid Blade and threw it at Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Liu Yun caught the Orchid Blade. As he waited for the dagger to appear again with full concentration, he said, “What kind of blade is this? Can it be used?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. It’s very sharp. It’s not inferior to the one in my hand.” Zhou Wen didn’t tell him that it was the Four Gentlemen Blade’s Orchid Blade, lest he scare him.</p>
<p>He didn’t dare to lend him the Bamboo Blade either. He was afraid that he would end up with even more bad luck and attract more trouble.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The dagger appeared behind Liu Yun. He leaned forward and twisted his body at the same time. With a back swing of his hand, he slashed at the dagger.</p>
<p>The dagger was sliced open by the Orchid Blade and disappeared as it flew out.</p>
<p>The dagger clearly didn’t give up on killing Liu Yun. It continued to appear, but it was struck by the Orchid Blade in Liu Yun’s hand.</p>
<p>After slashing more than ten times in a row, he forcefully snapped the dagger. Zhou Wen saw that he had managed to slash at the same spot every time. His technique was excellent and he wasn’t someone to be underestimated.</p>
<p>The dagger landed on the ground and quickly disintegrated, leaving behind a dimensional crystal. It looked like it had added stats.</p>
<p>“This blade isn’t bad. In any case, you still have a big one. Let me borrow the small one for a while. I’ll return it to you when we get out. You can name any conditions you want.” Liu Yun didn’t have any weapons on hand which made him uneasy. He wanted to use Zhou Wen’s Orchid Blade for the time being.</p>
<p>“Take it if you want to use it. Just follow the conditions we agreed on. There’s no need for any additional conditions,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Seeing how straightforward Zhou Wen was, Liu Yun suddenly felt that something was amiss. From the way he knew Zhou Wen, he definitely wasn’t someone who was easy to negotiate with.</p>
<p>There must be a problem. Liu Yun carefully sized up the Orchid Blade in his hand. After looking at it for a while, his expression suddenly changed. “This… This can’t be the Orchid Blade of the Four Baneful Blades, right?”</p>
<p>“As expected of my senior brother. You are knowledgeable,” Zhou Wen said with a thumbs up.</p>
<p>“It’s no wonder we are so unlucky when you’re carrying such a thing on you. I was fine coming to the desert so many times in the past, but something happened the moment you came. So it’s because of this evil thing. You really aren’t afraid of death… Wait…” Liu Yun said in an extremely foul manner as though he had suddenly thought of something. He looked at the Bamboo Blade at Zhou Wen’s waist and said with widened eyes, “That’s not the Bamboo Blade of the Four Baneful Blades, right? Are the things you have genuine?”</p>
<p>“What do you think?” Zhou Wen asked with a smile.</p>
<p>Liu Yun nearly jumped up, but when he thought about how he would die if his feet left the ground, he stopped himself. He pointed at Zhou Wen and said with a trembling voice, “You really have no concept of death. Just having any one of the Plum, Orchid, Bamboo, and Chrysanthemum Blades will lead to a terrible death. F*ck you. To think you have two. Do you really have a death wish!? It’s fine if you’re tired of living, but don’t drag me with you.”</p>
<p>With that said, Liu Yun was about to throw the Orchid Blade at Zhou Wen. He didn’t want to hold such an item for even a minute. He had already deeply experienced how terrifying it was to be unlucky.</p>
<p>“Senior Brother, you have to consider carefully. Without this Orchid Blade, you would be dead right now,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was taken aback as his expression turned complicated. Although Orchid Blade was infamous, if he didn’t have any weapons now, the chances of survival were too low.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, I really have to take my hat off to you. Couldn’t you have brought some normal weapons? Why have you brought such deadly things? Do you really have a death wish?” Liu Yun said gloomily, but he still held the Orchid Blade and didn’t throw it at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Cut the crap. Tell me how you mastered that movement technique,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Liu Yun told Zhou Wen the various Essence Energy Skills he needed for his movement technique before saying, “This thing of mine is mainly used when stealing. In terms of speed and exquisiteness, it’s inferior to your movement technique. Why are you learning it? Do you want to be a thief?”</p>
<p>“I’m just interested.” Zhou Wen didn’t believe that Liu Yun’s movement technique was as useless as he had said. His strange movement technique allowed him to adapt to various environments.</p>
<p>In the future, when Zhou Wen entered dimensional zones to fight, it would be impossible for every dimensional zone to have enough space for him to use his full range of movement techniques. If he were in some narrow and rugged area, Liu Yun’s movement techniques would be especially useful.</p>
<p>After silently memorizing Liu Yun’s movement technique methodology, Liu Yun said from behind, “What do we do now? Do we still need to continue moving forward?”</p>
<p>“There’s no way out. All we can do is walk forward,” Zhou Wen said as he continued.</p>
<p>Liu Yun knew that scouting was useless, so he didn’t plan on waiting for Zhou Wen to scout ahead. He walked over and levelled up with him.</p>
<p>When Liu Yun passed the stone slab that the black-armored warrior had appeared in, he didn’t activate it. It looked like the problematic stone slabs were purely random.</p>
<p>After taking a few steps, a stone slab lit up again and new words appeared.</p>
<p>Cause of death: Fire Burning</p>
<p>“How many ways of death are there in Netherworld City?” Zhou Wen focused his attention on his surroundings as he pushed Truth Listener’s ability to its limit.</p>
<p>However, the range Truth Listener could hear only had a radius of ten stone slabs. Everything beyond was silent as though it was muted.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could roughly tell that this was the maximum area they could hear sounds.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>With a loud thunderclap, a strange dimensional creature appeared by Zhou Wen’s side. It looked like a crocodile, but it stood there with its hind legs on the ground. It raised its front claws and its tail played a supporting role.</p>
<p>However, due to its short limbs, its body was fat and short. It looked a little adorable and wasn’t very tall. It only reached Zhou Wen’s waist.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was sizing it up, it opened its mouth and spat out a flame that surged at him.</p>
<p>The flames weren’t ordinary red-yellow in color, nor were they blue in color. Instead, they were white flames that looked like burning ice mist.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare be careless. He drew his saber and slashed out a Demonic Astral Wheel. The blood-red wheel of light tore out like a saw as it slashed at the strange flames.</p>
<p>The Demonic Astral Wheel’s destructive power was indeed very strong. It spun and sliced through the white flames, but the deeper it went, the slower the Demonic Astral Wheel spun. It only managed to slice through less than a meter before completely stopping, as though it had been frozen.</p>
<p>In the next second, the Demonic Astral Wheel shattered amid the white flames, turning into countless fragments. The fragments rapidly burned, causing the white flames to become even more ferocious as they enveloped Zhou Wen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter640'>Chapter 640 Death Knell</h3>
<p>At this moment, Zhou Wen felt that the techniques he had been practicing recently were mainly movement techniques. Now that he couldn’t move, he lacked the means to defeat his enemy.</p>
<p>I’ve had too little time. I don’t have the time to learn so many skills. Zhou Wen’s time was indeed limited. Others only needed to advance one Life Soul, but he needed to advance four.</p>
<p>Furthermore, his training time would be about a year. To be able to train his movement technique to epitome standards, his progression speed was terrifying.</p>
<p>However, at the critical moment, disasters didn’t give Zhou Wen the time to cultivate. Just as the white flames were about to shoot at him, Zhou Wen didn’t slash out again with Bamboo Blade. Instead, he used Demonic Astral Wheel’s suction and struck out with his palm. Using the spinning power, he diverted the white flames to the side.</p>
<p>Despite that, the rotation of the Demonic Astral Wheel gradually slowed down in the white flames. A few seconds later, the spinning force wasn’t enough to divert the white flames. All Zhou Wen could do was deliver another Demonic Astral Wheel.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sheathed the Bamboo Blade and constantly struck out Demonic Astral Wheel with both hands, diverting the white flames that spewed at him to the side.</p>
<p>Therefore, a magical scene happened. The monster spewed out flames that resembled white fire snakes, but they were diverted to the side by Zhou Wen’s Demonic Astral Wheel. It bloomed like flaming chrysanthemums that filled the sky.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, duck!” At this moment, Liu Yun suddenly shouted.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen crouched down and lowered his head. He saw a needle-like cold beam fly over his head.</p>
<p>The monster’s attention was on Zhou Wen, so it shifted its gaze downwards as he ducked. It wasn’t prepared for the cold beam of light as it instantly nailed into its eyes. The monster immediately let out a tragic cry.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took the opportunity to draw his saber and slash out. The Demonic Astral Wheel spun and beheaded the screaming monster.</p>
<p>On careful look, Orchid Blade had penetrated the monster’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Thanks.” Zhou Wen extended his hand and sucked the Orchid Blade back before throwing it at Liu Yun again.</p>
<p>“I won’t be able to live for long if you’re dead. Two people are better than one. I’m doing this for myself. Instead, I’m more concerned about you. You expended so much Essence Energy just now. It’s best you recover your Essence Energy before continuing,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen didn’t really need Liu Yun’s help, he would provide him significant help in escaping Netherworld City since Liu Yun had expressed his goodwill and was willing to work together with him to face the problem.</p>
<p>“If you don’t have Essence Energy Crystals, I can sell them to you. How about ten Epic Essence Energy Crystals for your movement technique?” Liu Yun had some ideas about Zhou Wen’s movement techniques.</p>
<p>His movement technique was already fast enough. Few people at his level could catch up to him, but Zhou Wen’s movement technique was even faster than his. He also wanted to know how Zhou Wen had mastered it.</p>
<p>“Don’t you think ten crystals is a tad too little?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“You have to know that we are in a dire situation. No one knows when we will be able to leave, nor do we know how many battles we will have to go through. The present value of Essence Energy Crystal is ten times or even a hundred times what it usually is. It’s very possible that an Essence Energy Crystal might save us at the end. If you can use another skill, you might be able to survive. Do you still think it’s expensive?” Liu Yun said seriously.</p>
<p>“It’s still expensive. Even if an Essence Energy Crystal is worth a hundred times more, do you think it can be exchanged for a divine movement technique?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“What? Your movement technique is at the divine level?” Liu Yun was shocked.</p>
<p>“As real as it gets. If you really want to know how it’s done, it’s best you show some sincerity and help me obtain Star Stealer,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Does the method need Mythical Skill Crystals?” Liu Yun asked.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. All the skills are at the Epic and Legendary stage. There’s no need for Mythical skill crystals,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“You comprehended a divine skill yourself?” Liu Yun was even more surprised.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Mythical Companion Beasts could be explained away by him being rich. There might be a faction or massive resources backing him.</p>
<p>However, comprehending a divine skill wasn’t something that could be accomplished with just resources. Although resources were one of the most important conditions, what really mattered was one’s perceptivity.</p>
<p>“Teacher’s eyes are really sharp. A random student he takes in has such standards. Unfortunately, in such a place, your divine movement technique is useless,” said Liu Yun with a sigh.</p>
<p>“Let’s continue walking. We don’t know how long a Netherworld City day is. Perhaps we don’t have as much time as we imagined,” Zhou Wen said as he continued walking forward.</p>
<p>Liu Yun quickly chased after him, clearly wanting to cooperate with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>After taking a few steps, Liu Yun also encountered dimensional creatures. This time, the dimensional creatures they encountered were the Blade Executioners they had previously seen. The cause of death was naturally death by blades.</p>
<p>Liu Yun had seen Zhou Wen kill the Blade Executioner, so he already had some understanding of it. He didn’t spend much effort to kill the Blade Executioner.</p>
<p>The two of them walked forward together. There were four types of dimensional creatures they often encountered: Blade Executioners who delivered death by blade, Flaming Evil Spirits who used Fire Burning, Flash Spirit Flying Blade who inculcated Horror, and Water Demon who used Drown.</p>
<p>They were all Epic dimensional creatures with their own characteristics. However, with Zhou Wen and Liu Yun’s cooperation, they killed them one by one, allowing them to smoothly walk over the stone slabs.</p>
<p>With every step the two of them took, Liu Yun would shout at the person ahead, hoping to see if he could hear him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally knew that it was useless. Unless they came within ten stone slabs of each other, the other party definitely couldn’t hear their voices.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen did some calculations. They needed 153 steps to reach a distance of ten stone slabs from the person. That would leave them with slightly over 200 steps.</p>
<p>This was only enough for them to speak to each other. It was unknown how many steps it would take to leave Netherworld City.</p>
<p>The two of them took 120 steps and could already see that the person closest to them was very close. Just as they were about to continue advancing, they suddenly heard a bell chime.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The sudden ringing of the bell gave the two of them a fright. The sound was coming from a building at the end of the stone steps. There was a brass bell hanging on it that emitted the heart-shuddering sound.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>The bell constantly rang. Zhou Wen had never heard such a strange bell chime. He felt that it wasn’t auspicious.</p>
<p>“What crappy bell is this? Why does it sound like a death knell?” Liu Yun blurted out.</p>
<p>“Death knell?” Zhou Wen was immediately taken aback.</p>
<p>After Liu Yun said it, he thought about it carefully and was stunned. The two of them exchanged looks and saw the unease in each other’s eyes.</p>
<p>The bell rang seven times before it finally stopped. In front of the building, a throne made of yellow jade slowly rose. There was a person sitting on the throne.</p>
<h3 id='chapter641'>Chapter 641: Bone Die</h3>
<p>The person was wearing armor carved from white bones. On his head was a skull-like mask. His eyes were shimmering with a strange red light as he casually sat on the yellow jade throne. His gaze was sizing up the people on the long street below.</p>
<p>He didn’t look like he was looking at humans, but more like beasts such as pigs or dogs.</p>
<p>He supported his face with one hand and tilted his head to look at them. Meanwhile, the people on the street below were all ghastly pale. Their bodies involuntarily trembled as though something extremely terrifying was about to happen.</p>
<p>“Who is that guy? Why is he so cocky?” Liu Yun whispered.</p>
<p>The person, far away above the stone steps, seemed to have heard Liu Yun’s words. Looking at him from afar, Liu Yun’s scalp immediately went numb and cold sweat broke out on his back.</p>
<p>Fortunately, that person only glanced at him and didn’t pay much attention to him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen noticed that in front of the person was a bowl made of a skull. Unfortunately, he didn’t know what was inside.</p>
<p>Truth Listener’s ability had been restricted. He couldn’t sense that far away.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, the person extended a hand and took some things from the bowl, clamping them between his fingers.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen see that they were dice—six of them. Each one was crystalline-like jade, but they looked more like the bones of some creature.</p>
<p>The dice didn’t look too special. Just like ordinary dice, there were numbers from one to six engraved on each of the six sides. The colors were red, like blood.</p>
<p>When the person picked up the dice, Zhou Wen and Liu Yun were alarmed because the stone slab beneath their feet lit up.</p>
<p>However, the stone slabs were extremely bright this time. A blood-colored number actually appeared on it.</p>
<p>The number under Zhou Wen’s feet was 19, and the number under Liu Yun’s feet was 18. Neither of them knew what this number represented.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen soon realized what the numbers meant. This was because blood-colored numbers lit up beneath the feet of the people in front of him. Everyone’s numbers were different. From 1 to 33, this meant that there were a total of 33 people on the long street. These numbers were their serial numbers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already figured out what would happen next.</p>
<p>That high and mighty fellow would definitely throw the dice. If the number he threw was the same as the number under someone’s feet, that person would definitely be in for a rough time.</p>
<p>From the reactions of the people in front of him, he knew that they must have experienced the same thing, which was why they appeared to be so afraid.</p>
<p>“I wonder what will happen if the points under our feet match the points he throws out?” Liu Yun also noticed something and swallowed his saliva.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but I’m certain that nothing good can come out of it.” As Zhou Wen spoke, the person waved his hand and threw the dice out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that he would throw the dice into the bowl, but to his surprise, the person threw the dice down.</p>
<p>Six dice landed on the stone steps and rolled along.</p>
<p>Amazingly, the six dice grew in size as they rolled. When they landed on the long street, they were more than a meter long.</p>
<p>Six huge rolling dice rumbled down the long street at an extremely fast speed. Wherever they passed, the people in front would dodge to the side, not daring to come into contact with the die. They looked extremely afraid.</p>
<p>“What should we do?” Liu Yun looked at the dice that were rolling. Two of the huge dice were likely to pass through the spot they were standing.</p>
<p>If they wanted to dodge, they needed to move at least three stone slabs.</p>
<p>“Let’s dodge it first.” Zhou Wen didn’t know what the dice were, so he decided to avoid them. He would wait until he figured out the situation when he went further forward.</p>
<p>Six dice rolled past them amidst rumbling, and their step counter was reduced by four steps.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The dice rolled all the way to the entrance and slammed into it. Then, they bounced back and landed in the open space inside the door. After rolling for a while, they stopped.</p>
<p>One two, three threes, one six, and one five—a total score of 22.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Liu Yun’s eyes immediately looked at the street in front of them. The person with the red number, 22, at his feet was around the middle of the long street. He looked like an extremely muscular middle-aged man. He was tall and mighty, and his muscles looked like steel.</p>
<p>Everyone on the long street looked at him, and his face instantly turned pale. He looked extremely horrified as he shouted crazily, but unfortunately, his voice couldn’t be heard. All they could see was his mouth open, but no one knew what he was shouting.</p>
<p>As he shouted, he ran crazily. However, no matter which stone slab he ran to, the stone slab would light up with the blood-red 22.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Without any warning, the middle-aged man’s body exploded like a split watermelon. Blood flowed everywhere.</p>
<p>However, the blood very quickly seeped into the cracks on the stone slabs, leaving not a single drop. It was as though the stone slabbed ground could suck blood.</p>
<p>The man on the throne spread his fingers and the six huge dice flew back into the air, shrinking amidst their flight. By the time they reached his hand, they had returned to their original size.</p>
<p>Holding the dice in his hand, the person looked coldly at the people on the long street. The throne slowly descended and eventually disappeared.</p>
<p>“That bastard. What does he treat us as? His toys?” Liu Yun gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, there’s nothing wrong with that.” Zhou Wen stared at the building on the stone steps. There was no longer a throne or man there.</p>
<p>After watching for a while, Zhou Wen said, “That fellow should be the most terrifying dimensional creature in Netherworld City. If we can kill him, we might have a chance of escaping.”</p>
<p>“How do we kill him? The rules of Netherworld City are set by him. We are just chess pieces on the board. How can we play chess with the chess player?” Liu Yun said with a bitter expression.</p>
<p>“That depends on whether he abides by the rules or not. If he abides by the rules, we still have a chance of defeating him even if he’s a chess player,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“What if he doesn’t follow the rules?” Liu Yun asked.</p>
<p>“Then we will have to think of a way to avoid the rules.” Zhou Wen looked at the person closest to them. There was still a look of horror on the person’s face. From the looks of it, he had been frightened by the scene.</p>
<p>“Let’s go and ask them what’s going on here,” Zhou Wen said as he continued walking forward.</p>
<p>They weren’t too far from that person. After killing a few Epic dimensional creatures, they finally arrived within ten steps of that person.</p>
<h3 id='chapter642'>Chapter 642: Chu He</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The person’s hair was already gray and he looked to be in his fifties or sixties. He was thin. Although there were many wrinkles on his face, his chiseled edges were still there. It was obvious that he had been a handsome man when he was young.</p>
<p>When the old man was looking at the dice, he saw Zhou Wen and Liu Yun. He also knew that they were walking over, but he didn’t seem to have the desire to communicate with them. All he did was stand there dejectedly.</p>
<p>“How should I address you?” Liu Yun asked.</p>
<p>When the old man heard the voice, it was as if he had just woken up. He subconsciously answered, “My name is Chu He. I’m a professor at Imperial Capital College’s History department.”</p>
<p>“Peasant? Is your wife called noon1?” Liu Yun joked.</p>
<p>“It’s not that. It’s Chu He as in the Chu River.” The old man didn’t have any sense of humor. In such an environment, there was nothing that could make him laugh. Therefore, the old man explained seriously.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s eyes widened when he heard the elder’s words. He asked in disbelief, “Chu He? How many professors in the Imperial Capital College’s History department are named Chu He?”</p>
<p>“I’m the only one.” Chu He seemed somewhat numb. He didn’t care why Zhou Wen would ask such a strange question.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Chu He excitedly. In the entire Imperial Capital College, Zhou Wen only knew of one person named Chu He.</p>
<p>The reason Zhou Wen could remember this name wasn’t because Chu He was famous. No matter how famous Chu He was in his field, Zhou Wen couldn’t care less, much less remember his name.</p>
<p>However, this Chu He was different. This was because there was a history professor at Imperial Capital College. He was a member of the former principal’s expedition team.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen Chu He’s name and information on the list, and he had also seen the picture of the expedition team.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had only had a general look back then. Chu He wasn’t his target, so he didn’t pay much attention to him.</p>
<p>Now that he thought about it, this Chu He was indeed somewhat similar to the Chu He in the photo. However, the Chu He in the photo was slightly plumper. He wasn’t this thin and he looked better. He had a ruddy face and black hair. He wasn’t as pale as he was now. Back then, Chu He was in high spirits.</p>
<p>Is he really Professor Chu He from the expedition team? Shouldn’t he have entered the Zhuolu battlefield with the former principal and company? They went missing together, so how could he be here? Zhou Wen believed that the former principal had been killed, but for a person who had likely been killed with the former principal to appear in Netherworld City made him feel alarmed again.</p>
<p>Could it be that Netherworld City is really the place where humans come to after death? Could it be that the people in this city aren’t living humans, but dead ghosts? Then what about Liu Yun and me? Could it be that we are already dead without even realizing it? Did our souls enter Netherworld City? Zhou Wen shook his head and threw this ridiculous thought out of his mind.</p>
<p>“Professor Chu, have you been to the Zhuolu battlefield for research?” Zhou Wen asked as he stared at Chu He. He hoped that Chu He was Professor Chu He from the expedition team.</p>
<p>If they were really the same person, it was very likely that the former principal hadn’t been killed if Professor Chu He was still alive. After all, he hadn’t found the former principal’s corpse in Zhuolu, nor had he discovered any other relics.</p>
<p>Ever since he was young, there hadn’t been many people who had treated Zhou Wen well. The former principal was one of them. Zhou Wen felt that a good person like the former principal shouldn’t have died so early. At the very least, he didn’t wish for the former principal to die so early.</p>
<p>“No.” Chu He shook his head.</p>
<p>“How can that be? Think about it carefully. The Federation invited you to participate in the expedition team to Zhuolu. You, Professor Ouyang Ting, and a few other experts and professors went to Zhuolu together,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>After speaking for a while, Chu He’s thoughts seemed to become more active. After hearing Zhou Wen’s words, he lowered his head and thought for a moment before saying, “I remember. There was such an incident. Back then, an organization under the Federation did invite me to Zhuolu to carry out research work. I remember that there was an old professor Ouyang Ting on the list.”</p>
<p>“If you went to Zhuolu with them, why are you here alone?” Zhou Wen asked in excitement. He had already taken a look at the others on the street, but he hadn’t discovered the former principal or the other members of the expedition team.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Chu He shook his head and said, “No, no, no. I didn’t go to Zhuolu. I had a major discovery at that time and wanted to do research in the Taklamakan Desert, so I rejected the invitation and didn’t go to Zhuolu.”</p>
<p>“You rejected the invitation?” Zhou Wen looked at Chu He with disbelief.</p>
<p>He had read the information on the Zhuolu expedition team. Although there was no more information after they went missing, the records were still very detailed. There were even their punch card records when they were at the encampment.</p>
<p>Many people in the encampment had seen Professor Chu He before. Some had even chatted with him. Now, Chu He had actually said that he hadn’t gone to Zhuolu and had rejected the invitation from the beginning. This made many thoughts flash through Zhou Wen’s mind.</p>
<p>Is this Chu He lying? Or did he really not go to Zhuolu? If he really didn’t go to Zhuolu, then who’s the Chu He in Zhuolu? Is this Chu He fake? Or is the expedition team’s Chu He fake? Or is it the same person? Did the soul enter Netherworld City after Chu He died and he has already forgotten the past? That’s not right. He still remembers his name and knows that he’s a professor at Imperial Capital College. It doesn’t look like his memories have been washed away. Zhou Wen’s mind was in a mess; he couldn’t figure out what was going on.</p>
<p>“Yes, I rejected it,” Chu He said bitterly. “I was in a dilemma back then. If I had chosen to go to Zhuolu, I wouldn’t have been trapped in this place that’s akin to hell.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, If you had gone to Zhuolu back then, your outcome might not have been better than now. At the very least, you’re still alive. I’m not even sure if the former principal and company are dead or not.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, let’s chat about all of that later. We don’t have much time left. Ask the important questions,” said Liu Yun anxiously.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded and asked, “Professor Chu, how did you enter Netherworld City? What’s the situation here?”</p>
<p>Chu He said, “Back then, I was studying the ruins of the Niya civilization in the desert. Who knew that I would encounter a sandstorm? After the sandstorm passed, I saw Netherworld City. Then, there was a huge fire around me. I had no choice but to escape into Netherworld City.”</p>
<p>The experience of Chu He and Zhou Wen’s entering Netherworld City was similar. However, Zhou Wen thought of another important problem.</p>
<h3 id='chapter643'>Chapter 643: Torture Chambers</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Professor Chu, when did you enter Netherworld City?” Zhou Wen asked directly.</p>
<p>If this Chu He was really Professor Chu He from Imperial Capital College, then the Professor Chu He who went to Zhuolu was likely a fake.</p>
<p>However, since the imposter hadn’t been discovered, this meant that Professor Chu He must have come to the desert a long time ago. That was why no one had seen him again. Otherwise, the imposter would have been discovered long ago.</p>
<p>In that case, Professor Chu He should have entered Netherworld City a while ago. Otherwise, he would definitely have made contact with the outside world. Someone outside should know that he was in the desert and not Zhuolu.</p>
<p>However, the truth was that no one knew of such a situation. Even Chu He’s family believed that he was in Zhuolu. This was extremely odd.</p>
<p>If someone hadn’t deliberately cut off the connection between Professor Chu He and the outside world, it would have been because he had entered Netherworld City a long time ago. That was why no one knew he was here.</p>
<p>However, with the three ironclad rules of Netherworld City, how did Professor Chu He survive?</p>
<p>“When?” Professor Chu He looked at him strangely and said, “Just today. Didn’t you come in today when you encountered a sandstorm?”</p>
<p>“Today? Didn’t you contact your family before you came in?” Zhou Wen asked in disbelief.</p>
<p>“There’s no signal in the desert. How can I contact my family? It was only about a couple of weeks ago. I went to the city outside the desert to contact my family once. At that time, I was very excited to tell them that I had made a huge discovery and that I would be back soon to reunite with them. I never expected…” Chu He’s face was filled with sorrow.</p>
<p>This left Zhou Wen completely dumbfounded. Chu He had contacted his family a couple of weeks ago, so why hadn’t his family mentioned this matter? His family had never mentioned that Chu He had gone to the Taklamakan.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen wished he could return immediately and ask Chu He’s family what was going on.</p>
<p>From Zhou Wen’s point of view, this wasn’t a coincidence. Two Professor Chu Hes had appeared in different places. There had to be someone pulling the strings from behind.</p>
<p>Who’s doing these things? If the Zhuolu expedition team’s Chu He is fake, what did the fake Chu He want to do by joining the expedition team? Could the former principal’s disappearance have something to do with him? With this in mind, Zhou Wen’s mind became active.</p>
<p>If someone really abducted the former principal away, the former principal might still be alive.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was somewhat anxious. Zhou Wen kept asking questions that weren’t pertinent. All he could do was ask himself, “Professor Chu, you came earlier than us. Do you know what’s going on here? What exactly is that dimensional creature that appeared up there?”</p>
<p>“That’s City Lord Netherworld. The bronze bell hanging there will ring every hour. It’s the same as the wall clock at home. When the bell rings seven times, he will appear and cast the dice to take a life…” Chu He said with a trembling body.</p>
<p>“Wait, you said that it rings seven times a day. Doesn’t that mean you have been here for more than a day?” Zhou Wen discovered the problem in Chu He’s words.</p>
<p>Chu He said with a bitter smile, “I heard it from others. As you saw, City Lord Netherworld really appeared and even took a life. Perhaps it will be my turn tomorrow. However, my worries are unnecessary. I don’t even know if I can survive today. Why should I be worried about tomorrow?”</p>
<p>Liu Yun was immediately disappointed. He originally imagined that he would find someone who knew what was happening and obtain some information about Netherworld City, but to his surprise, Chu He had entered Netherworld City the same day as them, albeit a little earlier than them.</p>
<p>Taking a closer look at Chu He’s feet, he realized that he still had 132 steps left. That was even fewer than Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>“Professor Chu, have you learned anything about Netherworld City and City Lord Netherworld?” Liu Yun continued asking unwillingly.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was surprised when he realized that Chu He knew much more than he had imagined.</p>
<p>According to what Chu He had heard, the three ironclad rules of Netherworld City could not be violated. Otherwise, one would immediately die.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the distance between the stone slabs was a number. Be it advancing or retreating, or moving left and right repeatedly, it was part of the count.</p>
<p>Once the number dropped to zero, it meant death.</p>
<p>Chu He saw a person self-destruct because of the number turning zero. It was identical to how the middle-aged man who had died just moments ago.</p>
<p>It was said that there was only one way to leave Netherworld City alive. That was to walk to the end of the long street and step onto the stone steps to reach the Netherworld Divine Throne. Only by sounding the bronze bell on it can one leave Netherworld City.</p>
<p>“That’s impossible. From here to the stone steps, there are at least two to three thousand stone slabs. With just the few steps allocated to us, we can’t even reach the stone steps, much less walk up the stone steps and strike the bell,” Liu Yun said with a frown.</p>
<p>“It’s not impossible to increase the number of steps. Every new hour, the doors on both sides of the long street open. When the time comes, we have a chance to obtain more steps,” Chu He said as he pointed at the tightly-shut doors.</p>
<p>“Are the shops selling steps? What do we use to buy them? Is it money or dimensional crystals?” Liu Yun asked as he sized up the shops on both sides of the street.</p>
<p>“No, those aren’t shops, but torture chambers. You can be punished in the torture chamber in exchange for the number of steps. The punishment in each torture chamber is different. You can obtain different steps from different punishments…” As Chu He spoke, his eyes revealed fear.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Liu Yun were dumbfounded when they heard that. According to Chu He, there were various kinds of punishments in the torture chambers.</p>
<p>Getting branded by a piece of red-hot metal on the chest until the flesh scorched could exchange for five steps.</p>
<p>Having needles stab the ten fingers could be exchanged for ten steps. Having a piece of flesh taken with a blade could obtain one step.</p>
<p>Although these sorts of punishments wouldn’t kill, it left one shuddering in fear.</p>
<p>“In that case, as long as we can endure the pain, we can obtain enough steps to walk up the stone steps?” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“That’s not entirely the case. Every punishment only gives steps the first time,” Chu He said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately counted the number of torture chambers on both sides of the street. According to the information he had obtained from Chu He, one could obtain about ten steps from each torture chamber.</p>
<p>“239 torture chambers. If we can obtain 10 steps from each torture chamber, we can obtain more than 2000 steps. With so many steps, can we walk up the stone steps?” Zhou Wen estimated that it was about there, but this was only an estimate. It wasn’t necessarily accurate.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, we seem to have made a mistake…” Liu Yun’s expression turned nasty as he thought of the same problem as Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Steps were scarce. One had to visit all the torture chambers once before they could ascend and reach the Netherworld Divine Throne.</p>
<p>However, as they walked all the way, they had already missed many torture chambers. If they walked back now, it would be a waste of many steps, making their already small number of steps even fewer.</p>
<h3 id='chapter644'>Chapter 644: Punishment</h3>
<p>“If we continue like this, I’m afraid we won’t have enough steps to reach the Netherworld Divine Throne. If we backtrack, the number of steps we take will also decrease,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head and said, “Even if we start with the first torture chamber, I’m afraid we won’t be able to reach the Netherworld Divine Throne.”</p>
<p>“Why? Will there not be enough steps?” Liu Yun was puzzled.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if the number of steps is enough. However, I do know that in the short span of a day, suffering 239 types of punishments might be nothing to our bodies individually, but can we take a total of 239 punishments? I doubt I can. Among the people I know, I’m afraid only one person can complete this street and survive all the punishments. Unfortunately, he’s not here,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Although it’s very difficult, we still have to give it a try. We can’t just sit back and wait for death, right?” Liu Yun said.</p>
<p>“Then give it a try later,” Zhou Wen said as he pointed at the shop beside him.</p>
<p>“As you wish.” Liu Yun also knew that at this stage, he had to try his best. Otherwise, there was no way out.</p>
<p>“Do you want to go back first?” Liu Yun looked at the path they had taken, but he quickly rejected it. “I’ll first try entering the torture chamber beside me.”</p>
<p>There was still some time before the next hourly bell. The two of them could only stand there and wait.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took out his phone to take a look, but he still hadn’t finished downloading it. The dungeon map was clearly very big.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took the opportunity to cultivate Gods Retreat. Every time he summoned it, he would switch it away when it was about to explode. After repeated cultivation, the jade infant’s body became more transparent. Soon, it became as transparent as crystal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen vaguely felt that the jade infant was about to break through.</p>
<p>I wonder what a Life Soul’s Perfect Body would be like? Zhou Wen placed all his hopes on the jade infant. Gods Retreat wasn’t enough to resist the taboo power here. If it could advance to a Perfect Body, they might still have a chance of survival.</p>
<p>As for entering the punishment chamber to receive punishment, Zhou Wen didn’t pin much hope on it. His physique was already very strong, but he might not be able to withstand so many punishments in such a short period of time. Unless Li Xuan was here, Zhou Wen didn’t even wish to give it a try.</p>
<p>An hour quickly passed. While the jade infant rested, Zhou Wen chatted with Chu He and deliberately asked about his past.</p>
<p>Chu He was already reeling in horror after being trapped here. Being able to chat with others was also a way to relieve stress. He said a lot.</p>
<p>Chu He remembered everything that had happened in the past very clearly. It didn’t look like there was a problem with him, nor was there any memory loss.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>The bell rang again. This time, the bell rang eight times. After the bell stopped, the torture chambers that had been closed on both sides of the street opened their doors.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the torture chamber beside him and saw that there was a strange torture device inside. It looked like a wooden horse, and on its back was a long spike that resembled a unicorn’s horn. However, it wasn’t growing on its head, but on its back.</p>
<p>Beside the torture equipment was a sign with the words “Wooden Horse Punishment Twenty Steps” written on it.</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother, you get twenty steps each punishment. The rewards are very high. Do you want to give it a try?” Zhou Wen asked Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s face turned green when he saw the torture equipment. He immediately shook his head and said, “No way! I’ll try this instead. Punishment by a thousand cuts. Every slice of meat is one step. More slices, more steps. This is a punishment that can be repeatedly undertaken. Perhaps it’s a better opportunity to get more steps.”</p>
<p>“Can you take it?” Zhou Wen looked at the torture chamber and saw that there was an iron chain hanging on the beam. Beside it was a dagger.</p>
<p>With one look, he roughly understood that one was going to be cuffed by the hands and hoisted up before having the dagger slice off pieces of meat.</p>
<p>“As a man, anything can be done to live. I’ll do it.” Liu Yun knew that if he wanted to live, he had to risk it.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Liu Yun followed Chu He’s earlier instructions and shouted at the punishment by a thousand cuts chamber, “I want to undertake punishment by a thousand cuts.”</p>
<p>The moment he finished his sentence, his body vanished as though he had teleported. Zhou Wen looked over and saw that his hands had been cuffed and he was hanging in the torture chamber.</p>
<p>The tiny blade was picked up by a white ghost-like creature before it slashed at Liu Yun’s thigh.</p>
<p>The small blade was like a saw as it sliced back and forth, bit by bit. A piece of flesh fell from Liu Yun’s thigh.</p>
<p>It had to be said that the white ghost’s blade techniques were first-rate. The flesh that was sliced off was as thin as a cicada’s wing and was almost transparent. It was comparable to a top chef.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen roughly understood why the flesh sliced off was so thin. It wasn’t because they were afraid of the victim dying, but because if it was too thick, he wouldn’t have enough flesh to cut a thousand slices. It naturally couldn’t be considered a punishment by a thousand cuts.</p>
<p>It was only one slice, but Liu Yun’s face was pale from the pain. Not much flesh had been sliced off, but the wound was nothing in comparison to the pain.</p>
<p>Liu Yun gritted his teeth and didn’t say a word. The small blade continued to slice off another piece of flesh.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen looked at Liu Yun again, his forehead was breaking out in cold sweat.</p>
<p>Chu He’s heart trembled as he watched from the side. Such a bloody and cruel punishment made one’s hair stand on end.</p>
<p>Liu Yun didn’t even grunt as the blade sliced through his flesh. He was like a classic example of a true man. Even Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be impressed. Liu Yun was truly unyielding.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s surprise, Liu Yun’s wounds didn’t bleed much. Every time the tiny blade sliced off a piece of flesh, the wound would automatically contract without much bleeding.</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother, I couldn’t tell. You’ve also practiced such a powerful self-recovery technique,” Zhou Wen exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Self-recovery my ass. It’s the power of the torture chamber that prevents me from bleeding. It’s afraid I’ll die before I complete the thousand cuts,” cursed Liu Yun.</p>
<p>He wasn’t really such a hot-tempered person. All he wanted to do was to vent his pain through his cursing.</p>
<p>After 23 slices, the unyielding Liu Yun finally couldn’t hold it in any longer. He shouted, “I give up on continuing the torture.”</p>
<p>With a clang, the metal cuff released and Liu Yun’s body fell. However, when he landed, he returned to the stone slab he was on before the punishment.</p>
<p>Indeed, the number on his stone slab increased by 23.</p>
<p>“See, isn’t it simple? I got it to increase by 23 in no time at all. Try a few more torture chambers, and it won’t be a problem for us to reach the Netherworld Divine Throne,” Liu Yun said with a pale face.</p>
<p>Ignoring Zhou Wen, even Chu He could tell that Liu Yun was merely comforting himself.</p>
<h3 id='chapter645'>Chapter 645: Scream Loudly If You Are In Pain</h3>
<p>“If we have to continue being tortured like this, I’m afraid we will be dead long before we can finish all the punishments.” Zhou Wen looked at Chu He and asked, “Professor Chu, other than being punished, is there any other way to obtain steps? Previously, when we came, we encountered some dimensional creatures. Would they leave anything special after they die?”</p>
<p>Chu He shook his head firmly and said, “There’s no other way. Only by being tortured in the torture chamber can one obtain more steps.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned his head and looked at the long street. Apart from them, the others had entered the torture chambers to be punished.</p>
<p>It was a pity that he couldn’t hear anything beyond ten steps. Otherwise, he would definitely be able to hear the undulating screams.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, do you want to give punishment by a thousand cuts a try as well? Perhaps you can last longer than me?” Liu Yun encouraged him. He wanted to see how long Zhou Wen could last under such torture.</p>
<p>“I think I’ll forget about it.” Zhou Wen shook his head and looked around. He planned on attempting a less severe punishment.</p>
<p>Although they could enter the torture chamber directly without needing to walk over, they needed to be within ten steps of one. If the torture chamber was too far from them, they wouldn’t be able to undergo the punishment.</p>
<p>Now, there was only one torture chamber to their left and right that were within ten steps away On the left was the punishment by a thousand cuts which Liu Yun had attempted.</p>
<p>On the right was punishment by whipping. On it stated a step per lash.</p>
<p>It was similar to punishment by a thousand cuts. One was hoisted up for the punishment. However, it wasn’t the slicing of flesh but lashing with a whip.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was also looking at the whip. Seeing that it was a vine whip, he said, “Then let me try the punishment. My body is quite tough. I should be able to withstand it a few more times.”</p>
<p>With that said, Liu Yun shouted at the whipping torture chamber, “I want to undertake punishment by whipping.”</p>
<p>Just like the last time, Liu Yun’s body vanished. He was hung in the whipping torture chamber. Then, a white ghost-like figure appeared and picked up the vine whip.</p>
<p>The vine whip was lashed out by the white figure. Sharp spikes appeared on the originally smooth whip, making it appear like a thorny vine.</p>
<p>Pa! With a crisp sound, a bloody whip mark appeared on Liu Yun’s body.</p>
<p>After a few whips, Liu Yun’s body was reduced to a bloody mess. It was even more terrifying than punishment by a thousand cuts.</p>
<p>This time, Liu Yun only held on for about ten whips before giving up. After being released, he looked a little shriveled.</p>
<p>“F*ck, this isn’t giving us a way out. How can humans withstand such punishment? Death by punishment, death also by not undergoing punishment. Why should we be punished!?” Liu Yun cursed.</p>
<p>“I’ll give it a try too.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and shouted at the whipping torture chamber, “I want to undertake punishment by whipping.”</p>
<p>The moment he finished his sentence, Zhou Wen felt his vision blur. His body seemed to be teleported by some force. By the time he reacted, he was already hung up in the whipping chamber.</p>
<p>A white ghost appeared in front of him. It had already gripped the vine whip.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, scream loudly if you are in pain. Don’t endure it. The more you endure, the more painful it will be. It will be much better if you shout out loud. The louder you shout, the better,” Liu Yun said gloatingly.</p>
<p>He was actually just trying to find pleasure amidst the suffering, hoping to reduce his stress. He didn’t really want to hear Zhou Wen scream.</p>
<p>“Alright,” Zhou Wen replied as he switched his Essence Energy Art to Dao Body and Gods Retreat before closing his eyes.</p>
<p>However, the Gods Retreat Life Providence didn’t affect the white ghost. Clearly, the punishment in the torture chamber wasn’t a taboo power.</p>
<p>Seeing that Gods Retreat was useless, Zhou Wen hurriedly switched to Small Perfection of Wisdom. At the same time, he activated the Hell King Life Soul. Under the effects of the Hell King Life Soul, Zhou Wen’s control over his body was extremely strong. Not only did his physique strengthen, but he could also eliminate the pain.</p>
<p>No matter how serious his injuries were, Zhou Wen wouldn’t feel any pain. It was as though his pain nerves had been removed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t plan on constantly being punished. All he wanted to do was try out the force of the whipping punishment.</p>
<p>However, just as Zhou Wen used the Hell King Life Soul, the white specter that had already lashed out suddenly retracted its whip without striking.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, what’s going on? Don’t tell me you can’t even withstand a whip and are giving up?” Liu Yun said when he saw the scene before him, imagining that Zhou Wen had given up.</p>
<p>However, what happened next left Liu Yun’s mouth agape.</p>
<p>The white ghost with the whip actually plopped to the ground and kowtowed. It lay prone, trembling.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The shackles that bound Zhou Wen’s hands automatically opened, allowing him to land.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen hadn’t given up on being tortured, so he didn’t return to the long street. Instead, he landed in the whipping chamber.</p>
<p>His feet landed on the ground, but there were no numbers on the floor. Perhaps it was because the steps didn’t count in the torture chambers.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother… What’s going on…” Liu Yun stared at Zhou Wen with his mouth agape as he looked at the trembling white ghost in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen never expected his Hell King Life Soul to have such an effect.</p>
<p>Looking at the white ghost sprawled on the ground, Zhou Wen pondered for a moment before saying to it, “Stand up.”</p>
<p>The white ghost was very obedient. It obediently stood up, but its body was still trembling. It looked extremely frightened.</p>
<p>“Don’t be afraid. Come, whip me,” Zhou Wen said gently to the white ghost.</p>
<p>The white ghost trembled again as it collapsed to the ground and kowtowed to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Stand up. I order you to whip me,” Zhou Wen said coldly to the white ghost.</p>
<p>The white ghost crawled up trembling as it held the whip in its hand, but it didn’t dare to whip Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I’m giving you permission to whip me, but you have to whip me gently. Just gently touch me,” Zhou Wen instructed the white ghost.</p>
<p>The white ghost held the whip, but it didn’t dare attack. Zhou Wen glared at it before it finally flung the whip and struck Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>The whip whistled through the air, but it only touched Zhou Wen’s clothes and immediately retracted. Zhou Wen felt his skin being touched by his clothes. There was no pain at all.</p>
<p>The white ghost was terrified. It sprawled on the ground and kowtowed again.</p>
<p>“You did well. That’s right. Do it again. Lash me a few more times,” Zhou Wen encouraged.</p>
<p>Only then did the white ghost stand up shakily and lashed at Zhou Wen’s body again. Just like before, it retracted once the whip touched his clothes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found a spot to sit down. As he took out his phone, he got the white ghost to torture him.</p>
<p>“This spot… A little heavier here… My shoulders are a little sore… Strike this side… Use more strength…” Zhou Wen kept directing the white ghost to attack the various parts of his body.</p>
<p>“Seriously?” Liu Yun and Chu He were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>The originally terrifying atmosphere was now gone. The white ghost held the vine whip and served Zhou Wen like it was a masseur at a massage parlor.</p>
<h3 id='chapter646'>Chapter 646: Dead Man</h3>
<p>Only when the torture chambers along the entire street closed was Zhou Wen forcefully teleported out, returning him to the stone slab he was on.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, Liu Yun, and Chu He looked at the stone slab beneath Zhou Wen’s feet and saw that the number on the stone slab had changed to 1369. In other words, Zhou Wen had obtained more than a thousand steps during the torture chamber’s opening. This was the same number Zhou Wen had secretly taken note of.</p>
<p>So this can really increase the number of steps. Zhou Wen felt a lot more relaxed. With the Hell King’s strength, the problem with insufficient steps was resolved.</p>
<p>However, he couldn’t completely relax. Although the Hell King’s strength could intimidate the torture chamber, it was unable to withstand the rules of Netherworld City.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a step while maintaining the Hell King Life Soul’s state. The subsequent steps would still decrease, indicating that the rules of Netherworld City were still effective on him.</p>
<p>Now, he had only resolved the problem of the number of steps. He had yet to resolve the three ironclad rules of Netherworld City. He had to think of a way to leave as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“You… How did you do it?” Chu He looked at Zhou Wen in surprise. He had never seen someone undergo such torture like Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Liu Yun also wanted to know how Zhou Wen had done it. This fellow constantly surprised him.</p>
<p>He originally thought that he was doing pretty well. Although he wasn’t a member of the six families, he had the resources and skills that young geniuses of the six families didn’t have.</p>
<p>However, he never expected Zhou Wen to be even more equipped than him. He had all sorts of abilities, as though he could resolve anything he encountered.</p>
<p>“Perhaps my Essence Energy Art is effective against the white ghosts in the torture chamber,” Zhou Wen said half-truthfully.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, tell me you won’t leave your adorable and kind eldest senior brother behind, right?” Liu Yun was somewhat worried that Zhou Wen would leave after he had enough steps.</p>
<p>“How can that be? I’m still hoping that you will take me to the Endless Sea of Stars,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, you’re right. After we leave, I’ll definitely take you to the Endless Sea of Stars and help you obtain Star Stealer.” Liu Yun paused before saying, “You can walk freely, but I don’t have enough steps. What should I do?”</p>
<p>“When the torture chamber opens again next time, you and I will choose the same punishment room. When the time comes, I’ll get the white ghosts to take care of you. There you will naturally be given the needed steps,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Teacher really has good taste. Junior Brother, you’re really an amazing genius. I think that no one can be as glorious as you even if the six heroes were revived…” Liu Yun said obsequiously.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t believe a word he said. Although he was someone who seemed truthful, no one knew which sentences were true.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t wanted to go to the Endless Sea of Stars, Zhou Wen really didn’t wish to be with Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Although he was also Fang Mingyuan’s student, perhaps because Liu Yun had entered society a few years earlier than them, he felt that he wasn’t trustworthy like Jiang Yan, Zhong Ziya, and Hui Haifeng.</p>
<p>Of course, it was also possible that this was because Zhou Wen had never interacted with Liu Yun.</p>
<p>The three of them waited for another hour. After the bell rang again, the torture chambers opened again. Zhou Wen chose to enter the torture chamber. Liu Yun and Chu He also chose punishment by whipping.</p>
<p>The three of them hung side by side in the whipping chamber. Immediately, three white ghosts appeared. Each of them had a vine whip and was about to whip them.</p>
<p>The moment Zhou Wen’s Hell King Life Soul appeared, the three white ghosts immediately knelt down and trembled as though Zhou Wen was about to eat them.</p>
<p>Hence, the three of them sat side by side in the whipping chamber to be punished. This was the first time Liu Yun experienced the feeling of being raised on a pedestal. He grunted comfortably and said, “Junior Brother, if I had known that you had this ability, I wouldn’t have suffered the pain of punishment by a thousand cuts so much.”</p>
<p>“I only realized it after entering the torture chamber,” Zhou Wen said casually.</p>
<p>After the torture chamber closed, Zhou Wen had close to three thousand steps. Chu He and Liu Yun had more than a thousand steps.</p>
<p>“As long as we do it again, we should have enough steps to reach the Netherworld Divine Throne,” Liu Yun said happily.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, he saw someone explode on the long street. Blood splattered everywhere and was quickly absorbed by the ground.</p>
<p>“That person’s step count was used up. He couldn’t withstand the punishment and ended his life.” Chu He sighed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that there were fewer people on the long street. Now, there were only twenty-four people left. The few who had vanished probably died in the torture chambers.</p>
<p>The three of them continued waiting. As for Zhou Wen, he used the taboo power of Netherworld City to constantly train his jade infant.</p>
<p>The jade infant looked cold like a jade statue, but it later turned crystalline. However, with the baptism of the taboo power, the jade infant gradually softened. It was like a transparent jelly as if its body had turned soft.</p>
<p>Is it about to break through? Zhou Wen had a vague feeling that the jade infant was really about to break through. He was only half a step away.</p>
<p>Another hour passed. The three of them were once again tortured. By the time they came out, Zhou Wen’s steps had exceeded four thousand. The other two were almost nearing three thousand.</p>
<p>“This should be enough. Let’s go.” Liu Yun was in high spirits as he led the way.</p>
<p>Chu He naturally followed them. Zhou Wen wanted to bring Chu He out of this place before investigating if he was the real Chu He.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen discovered some problems. Chu He’s combat standards were very poor. He hadn’t advanced to the Epic stage and was only at the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>When he encountered dimensional creatures on the way, it was Zhou Wen and Liu Yun who helped him block them.</p>
<p>“Professor Chu, you don’t seem to be good at combat. How did you walk so far before we came?” Zhou Wen asked Chu He in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Chu He thought for a moment and said, “Before you came, I didn’t step on a stone slab that generated any cause of death.”</p>
<p>“Then, Professor Chu, your luck is really good.” Although Zhou Wen was somewhat suspicious, he couldn’t think of any other possibility other than this explanation.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen and company caught up to the people in front of them. However, all of them seemed numb. Zhou Wen and Liu Yun wanted to communicate with them, but all they did was grunt. It was as though they had fallen deep into despair.</p>
<p>“Forget it. There’s no way to communicate like this. Let’s go,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded and continued walking forward. Every time he encountered a person, Zhou Wen would attempt to communicate with them, but the further he went, the number they became. The subsequent ones ignored them like wooden statues.</p>
<p>These people seem to have some problems. When I first met Professor Chu He, he had similar tendencies. However, he was the closest to the city gate and had the mildest symptoms. It’s no wonder I felt that Chu He was a little odd from the beginning. I thought it was a result of not having spoken to others for a long time, but from the looks of it, that’s not the case, Zhou Wen thought to himself. However, he didn’t say anything because Chu He was beside him.</p>
<p>Soon, the three of them reached the end of the long street and stepped onto the stone steps. With every step they took, the consumption of their footsteps tripled. One step was equivalent to taking three steps on the stone slabs.</p>
<p>The 365 stone steps consumed just over a thousand steps.</p>
<p>Only Zhou Wen had enough steps. Chu He and Liu Yun didn’t have enough. Zhou Wen had no choice but to wait for the bell to ring again. He got them to find a torture chamber nearby and obtain enough steps before climbing the stone steps.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen struck the bell, he saw the golden divine throne slowly open. Behind it was Netherworld City’s exit, allowing him to see the desert outside.</p>
<p>However, City Lord Netherworld stood in the middle of the Netherworld Divine Throne, blocking their path. He glanced at the trio before his gaze landed on Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already prepared for battle. He didn’t believe that he could leave Netherworld City so easily.</p>
<p>“The two of you can leave. He needs to stay.” City Lord Netherworld didn’t take action. He only extended his index finger and pointed at Chu He.</p>
<p>“He can also ring the Netherworld Bell. Why can’t he leave?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“Because he’s already a dead person,” said City Lord Netherworld indifferently.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? He’s clearly a living person. How can he be a dead person?” Liu Yun said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly thought of something as he turned to look at Chu He and asked, “Professor Chu, what’s the exact date of your entry to Netherworld City?”</p>
<p>“It should be March 8, 28. Why?” Chu He asked in surprise.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression changed immediately. This was because it was the year the old professor and company had gone to Zhuolu. In other words, Chu He had entered Netherworld City that year, but he had always believed that he had only entered Netherworld City today. There was only one possibility.</p>
<p>With Chu He’s ability, it was impossible for him to survive in Netherworld City. Therefore, he had died long ago.</p>
<p>However, Chu He was standing in front of him, looking alive. It was hard to believe that he was a dead person.</p>
<h3 id='chapter647'>Chapter 647: The First Day is also the Last Day</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“No… I’m not a dead person… I’m still alive…” Chu He screamed in terror. His hand was still touching his body all over as though he was trying to confirm if he was really dead.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was abnormally bold. He reached out and pulled Chu He’s face. He said in disbelief, “He’s clearly a normal person. How can he be a dead person?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t tell in what way Chu He was a dead person. His body, heart rate, and temperature were all normal. Apart from appearing a little slow in thought, he couldn’t tell how he looked like a dead person.</p>
<p>However, if Chu He hadn’t died, it was difficult to explain how he entered Netherworld City so long ago only to claim that he had only entered today.</p>
<p>“If you aren’t afraid that his soul will dissipate and vanish forever, take him out of the city,” said City Lord Netherworld as he made way.</p>
<p>“Can we really leave?” Liu Yun looked at City Lord Netherworld with distrust.</p>
<p>In the years he had spent in society, he naturally understood the principle that human words couldn’t be trusted. Also, it was a dimensional creature who said those words. Furthermore, it was the owner of the netherworld. It sounded like true nonsense.</p>
<p>“As long as he isn’t afraid of his soul dissipating, just walk out of Netherworld City,” City Lord Netherworld said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Professor Chu, what do you think? Do you want to go out with us?” Liu Yun asked Chu He.</p>
<p>“I want to go out. I’m not a dead person,” Chu He hurriedly said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at City Lord Netherworld and asked, “We also entered Netherworld City. Why are we not dead, but Professor Chu He is?”</p>
<p>City Lord Netherworld seemed to be very patient. He glanced at Zhou Wen and answered, “Didn’t the ghost gates make it clear when you entered the city? None of the three ironclad rules of Netherworld City can be violated. Since he didn’t walk out the city alive on the day he entered, he’s naturally dead.”</p>
<p>“I’m not dead… I’m really not dead… Don’t believe him… Take me away…” Chu He’s eyes were bloodshot and his mental state was very unstable.</p>
<p>It wasn’t Chu He’s fault. Anyone who suddenly heard, in such a straightforward manner, that they were dead would be as nervous as Chu He.</p>
<p>“Professor Chu, don’t worry. I believe you. Leave the city with us,” Liu Yun said as he patted Chu He’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was suspicious, he couldn’t confirm that Chu He was really a dead person. After some hesitation, he looked at Chu He and said, “Professor Chu, you can choose whether you want to leave this place.”</p>
<p>“I’ll go with you. I’m really not a dead person,” Chu He said immediately.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s go then.” Zhou Wen stared at City Lord Netherworld and moved his feet towards the entrance formed by the Netherworld Divine Throne.</p>
<p>Chu He and Liu Yun followed Zhou Wen as they walked out of the door. At the same time, they were wary of City Lord Netherworld and prepared for battle.</p>
<p>However, City Lord Netherworld only watched from the side without any intention of stopping them.</p>
<p>Outside, in the desert, the sun was high in the sky. Beyond the Netherworld Divine Throne, there was bright sunlight. However, inside the Netherworld Divine Throne, it appeared eerie and dark.</p>
<p>Liu Yun walked in front and stepped out first, standing under the sun in the desert.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked at the back, constantly wary of City Lord Netherworld who didn’t move at all. All he did was look at them coldly.</p>
<p>Chu He stood in the shadows, one step away from the desert and the sun.</p>
<p>However, Chu He was somewhat hesitant. Although he was certain he wasn’t dead, City Lord Netherworld had said it with such certainty. Furthermore, Zhou Wen and Liu Yun had said that he had been in Netherworld City for a long time, making him somewhat afraid.</p>
<p>“I’m definitely not a dead person… I’m definitely not a dead person…” Chu He gritted his teeth and extended his palm towards the sun.</p>
<p>Just as his fingertip touched the sunlight, a blue light suddenly appeared. The tip of his finger that had extended out actually disintegrated and disappeared in the blue light.</p>
<p>“Ah… How is this happening…” Chu He screamed as he retracted his palm. His face was filled with disbelief and despair.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression changed slightly as he extended his hand and extended it into the sunlight. There wasn’t any problem. All he felt was that the temperature outside was very high and the sunlight was a little scorching, but it was still acceptable.</p>
<p>“Professor Chu, try extending your hand again,” Zhou Wen said to Chu He as he stood in the shadow of the Netherworld Divine Throne, maintaining his hand in the sunlight.</p>
<p>Chu He hurriedly extended his hand, but when his fingertip touched the sunlight, it immediately disintegrated.</p>
<p>“Impossible… I can’t be a dead person… Impossible… I still have to return to see my family… My wife and daughter are waiting for me…” Chu He slumped to the ground as his voice sounded disconsolate. Tears flowed down his face.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss as to what to do. He couldn’t bear to see Chu He’s present state as he looked at City Lord Netherworld and asked, “If he doesn’t leave, what will happen in the future?”</p>
<p>City Lord Netherworld calmly said, “He will receive punishment day after day, dying day after day. In the future, every day will be his first day. It will also be his last day until his soul reaches absolute purity.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought of the others on the long street. Those people were in much worse condition than Chu He. From the looks of it, what City Lord Netherworld said was true.</p>
<p>“What happens in the future?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“Who knows? If you are interested, you can stay and give it a try,” City Lord Netherworld said with a faint smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Chu He, unsure of what to say.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, can you do me a favor?” Chu He wiped his tears and asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Tell me. I’ll do it if I can,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Help me pay my family a visit. If possible, help me take care of my wife and daughter. When they are in trouble, help them as much as you can. I don’t have anything to repay you now. My research on the Niya civilization is all that I have. If you don’t mind, treat it as payment.” Chu He handed the documents in his backpack to Zhou Wen. Many of them were handwritten notes.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll take care of them.” Zhou Wen took the documents and nodded seriously.</p>
<p>Even without Chu He’s request, Zhou Wen would have made a trip to Chu He’s place. He still needed to figure out the matter regarding Chu He.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell them that I’m here. They’ve already been saddened once. Don’t let them be sad again,” Chu He said to Zhou Wen again.</p>
<p>“I know what to do.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>“Go. Don’t look back,” Chu He said, somewhat disheartened.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to turn around and walk out of the Netherworld Divine Throne.</p>
<p>“If you have the chance to come again, next time you can try to withstand all the punishments. Then, you will see the real Netherworld City.” The moment Zhou Wen walked out of the Netherworld Divine Throne, he heard the voice of City Lord Netherworld.</p>
<p>However, he had already walked out. When he looked back, he saw endless yellow sand behind him. There was no sign of the Netherworld Divine Throne or Netherworld City. It was as though everything that had happened was just a dream.</p>
<h3 id='chapter648'>Chapter 648: Hat City</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly felt something amiss in his hand. He looked down and saw the notebooks seemingly burn with invisible flames, turning to ashes.</p>
<p>Oh no! Zhou Wen immediately reacted. These notebooks should have long been destroyed with Chu He’s death. What Chu He had given him couldn’t be kept in the living world.</p>
<p>Before the notebook was completely reduced to ashes, Zhou Wen flipped through a few pages, but he didn’t see much content before the information was reduced to ashes. The desert wind blew, leaving no traces behind.</p>
<p>“It’s really like a dream. I never expected that I, Liu Yun, would make a trip to the netherworld and come back alive. What great luck,” Liu Yun said with lingering fear.</p>
<p>“Don’t think about that for now. Just take a look and see if you can tell where we are. Can you still find the way to the Endless Sea of Stars?” Zhou Wen perked up and sized up his surroundings.</p>
<p>There was yellow sand all around them. All he could see was a boundless desert with no end in sight. Zhou Wen couldn’t even work out his bearings.</p>
<p>“No problem. Leave it to me. However, do you really want to go to the Endless Sea of Stars? We seem to be a little unlucky. I’m afraid something will happen again…” Liu Yun glanced at the Bamboo Blade on Zhou Wen’s waist before throwing the Orchid Blade back to him. He didn’t want to carry this with him for even an additional moment.</p>
<p>“Does being unlucky mean that we should stay at home all day? What’s the point of living like that?” Zhou Wen took the Orchid Blade and said.</p>
<p>“That’s true. Alright, let’s continue.” Liu Yun didn’t say anything else. He looked around and summoned his Companion Beast to dig a deep hole as though he was observing the sand or something else.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen did not know how Liu Yun figured out his bearings. As he led the way, he observed the plants and sand in the desert before slowly adjusting his direction.</p>
<p>The desert was already boundless. After the dimensional storms, it had become even wider. Even Epic experts would probably be trapped to death if they got lost.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen had brought plenty of water and food. He didn’t have to be afraid of being trapped in the desert.</p>
<p>After repeatedly walking and stopping, on the fourth day, an oasis appeared in front of them.</p>
<p>“We’re here.” Liu Yun pointed at the oasis and shouted in joy.</p>
<p>“Is that oasis the Endless Sea of Stars?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“No, that oasis is where I usually replenish my water. However, we aren’t far from the Endless Sea of Stars once we reach here. It’ll take another two days at most,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He had plenty of pure water in his chaos space, so he didn’t need an oasis to replenish it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t tell Liu Yun about the Chaos Bead. He always retrieved water from his backpack. Liu Yun naturally didn’t know about it, so he had been economical along the way and was very thirsty. All he did was take a tiny sip of water to quench his thirst.</p>
<p>This oasis grew much vegetation that Zhou Wen didn’t recognize. There was a tree, but it looked like grass with thick roots. It looked very strange.</p>
<p>What surprised Zhou Wen was that there was actually a city in the oasis.</p>
<p>However, the city was very simple. The city walls were made of clay and looked like crude concrete.</p>
<p>“This is Hat City. Legend has it that it was built by the residents of the desert in the past. Back then, there was plenty of water here, but as the water source decreased, many residents left Hat City, causing it to gradually become abandoned. According to the elders in the desert, Hat City could accommodate tens of thousands of people during its golden years. However, due to the depletion of the water source, the area around the oasis shrank. Most of the buildings have been buried under the yellow sand. Together with the arrival of the dimensional storms, there’s no one here. Apart from some guides in the desert who occasionally come here to replenish their water, you usually wouldn’t even see a soul.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Liu Yun had already led Zhou Wen into Hat City.</p>
<p>As Liu Yun had said, many of the buildings here were half-buried in the sand.</p>
<p>These buildings should have been used to extract materials from the ground. They used yellow sand to mix with something, creating materials that resembled concrete.</p>
<p>Not long after entering the city, Zhou Wen saw a pitch-black behemoth. On careful look, it was a black cube.</p>
<p>“There’s a black cube in Hat City?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>“What’s so strange about that? Many human ruins have black cubes,” Liu Yun said disapprovingly as he walked towards the well in the oasis.</p>
<p>The desert well was more like an underground cellar. There were stairs that allowed one to walk down, and deep inside was a pool.</p>
<p>However, the water in the pool wasn’t very clean. Liu Yun excitedly poured it into the water bag, but Zhou Wen stood still. He didn’t want to drink the water.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you getting some water? In the desert, water is life. You can lack everything else, but you can’t lack water,” Liu Yun said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“It’s ok, I already have some.” Zhou Wen said as he left the well. He wanted to take a spin in Hat City.</p>
<p>However, just as he left the well, he saw the black cube light up. On the screen were two Companion Beasts fighting.</p>
<p>One of them was a golden giant. The other Companion Beast was the Orochi that Zhou Wen had seen before.</p>
<p>The Golden Giant roared like a war god. Every punch emitted a dazzling light that resembled the sun. The Orochi’s eight heads spewed out all sorts of Essence Energy, but they failed to block the Golden Giant’s attack.</p>
<p>However, the lashing of its eight tails made it tie with the Golden Giant.</p>
<p>The fist collided with the snake’s tails, producing the sound of metal clashing. Terrifying shock waves and sparks erupted, as though they were divine weapons clashing.</p>
<p>The Golden Giant seemed to hold the advantage, but it was not enough to kill Orochi.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched for a while and found something strange. Orochi had eight heads and eight tails, but when it fought the Golden Giant, there was always a tail stuck to the ground. The other seven snake tails fought the Golden Giant, but that tail never came into contact with it.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, he saw the Golden Giant’s fists suddenly slam into one other. Under the collision, a golden beam of light appeared.</p>
<p>The Golden Giant grabbed the beam with one hand and transformed it into a gigantic blade of light. It slashed at the body of Orochi. Its might was so powerful that it was most likely the power of the Golden Giant’s Wheel of Destiny. It wanted to end the battle.</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhou Wen saw the snake’s tail which had never taken part in the battle move. It was like the tail of a rattlesnake as it rapidly twitched and slashed out with an unparalleled sword beam.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The Golden Giant’s blade beam was sliced apart by the sword beam. Its body was also slashed open, leaving a long gash. It nearly tore through its chest and killed it.</p>
<p>Thankfully, its physique was indeed powerful, so it wasn’t halved. However, it didn’t have much combat strength left. It was summoned back by its master as a show of admitting defeat.</p>
<h3 id='chapter649'>Chapter 649: Behemoth Return</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>As the Golden Giant was defeated, Orochi’s eight heads rose up again and spat out eight words.</p>
<p>“The Federation is incompetent. The heroes are shameless.”</p>
<p>This was not the first time the words had appeared. More accurately, it was the third time.</p>
<p>Apart from the time when Ice Elemental Sprite Queen was defeated, there was also a Mythical dimensional creature that challenged Orochi, only to end in defeat. After that victory, Orochi similarly spat out the words.</p>
<p>Now that the Golden Giant was defeated again, the entire Federation seemed to explode. Public opinion turned to question the abilities of the six hero families.</p>
<p>If they couldn’t even deal with a single Orochi, how could they uphold the Federation’s peace?</p>
<p>There were even some relatively biting media outlets that directly used headlines like “Are the descendants of the heroes still heroes?” to criticize the six families’ inaction.</p>
<p>This was especially so for the West District’s media. They bombarded the Family Clan of Gods and Cape family with various opinions.</p>
<p>As the Zhang, Xia, and Dugu families hadn’t taken action to date, they weren’t as miserable as the other three families even though they were constantly questioned.</p>
<p>After all, they hadn’t been defeated. In theory, they still had the ability to win. They were different from the Cape family and the Family Clan of Gods who had been defeated one after another.</p>
<p>The six families also knew that their various schemes and arrangements were made to win the final championship. Now, an Orochi had stirred up the situation, disrupting their plans.</p>
<p>If they revealed their trump cards, it wouldn’t be difficult to kill Orochi. However, if that happened, they would lose the chance to vie for first place with the other families. Therefore, they could only send inferior Mythical Companion Beasts to fight, but the outcome was defeat.</p>
<p>The Zhang, Xia, and Dugu families were even more depressed. Of all times, the core forces of their three families had gone to the Southern Wilderness’s dimensional zones. Although there were others who could fight, the Companion Beasts were still in their plans. If they were exposed ahead of time, it would trigger a series of chain reactions and disrupt their plans.</p>
<p>As such, the Federation’s situation became very delicate.</p>
<p>None of the six families were willing to expose their top Mythical Companion Beasts, but they ended up being defeated by Orochi three times in a row. It left the entire Federation’s citizens ashamed.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, we can only expose some things ahead of time. Those few families are shameless, but our Xia family can’t be shameless.” Xia Dongyue was still hesitating as to which Mythical Companion Beast his family was to assign.</p>
<p>Not only was Orochi proficient in various attributes, but its physique was also powerful. With the indomitable sword beam, it could be said to be an extremely comprehensive Mythical Companion Beast. It wasn’t easy to defeat it cleanly and beautifully.</p>
<p>Why did Liuchuan have to go to the Southern Wilderness at such a time? Xia Dongyue thought gloomily. If Xia Liuchuan was here, his Companion Beast would be best at restraining a Companion Beast like Orochi. If the enemy wasn’t prepared, it wouldn’t be impossible to kill it in one strike.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Xia Liuchuan wasn’t around, causing Xia Dongyue to have a headache.</p>
<p>The Xia family wasn’t the only one with a headache. The other five families were also having a headache. At this stage, if they didn’t defeat Orochi, the reputation of the six families would probably be damaged.</p>
<p>The few families had already planned on sending their top Companion Beasts to battle, but at that moment, the black cube lit up.</p>
<p>The media had been bombarding the six families for their inaction. They hoped that they could step forward as soon as possible. Just as they were in a frenzy, they realized that the black cube had lit up. They thought that the six families had made a move.</p>
<p>However, they soon discovered that the entity who appeared on the cube was Tyrant Behemoth who had previously given up.</p>
<p>“Eh, why is Tyrant Behemoth out again? Didn’t it not dare to accept the battle previously?”</p>
<p>“It should be challenging other Companion Beasts, right?”</p>
<p>“Giving up without a fight means it already knew it was no match for its opponent. Now that it’s back again, it’s definitely not challenging Orochi.”</p>
<p>“Anyone can tell that a Companion Beast like Orochi is the nemesis of Tyrant Behemoth. No matter how strong its physique and strength is, it can’t withstand the indomitable tail of Orochi.”</p>
<p>Everyone believed that Tyrant Behemoth wanted to challenge the other Companion Beasts and board the rankings again, but to their surprise, when the name of the challenger lit up, it was Orochi.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? Didn’t it give up earlier? Why is it making the challenge now?”</p>
<p>“What kind of show is this? Despite knowing that the Companion Beast’s characteristics are restrained, they are still forcefully challenging Orochi?”</p>
<p>“Could it be that our Federation really doesn’t have any stronger Companion Beasts? We can only let the restrained Tyrant Behemoth fight?”</p>
<p>Instantly, voices of doubt and speculation arose. People were discussing why Tyrant Behemoth wanted to challenge Orochi at this moment.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t think too much about it. He was also a member of the Federation, so he felt uncomfortable being insulted like this.</p>
<p>Of course, it was mainly because Zhou Wen had the intention to get high on the rankings. Furthermore, he could take down Orochi, who had gotten to its position by kicking Tyrant Behemoth out.</p>
<p>After watching the battle between Orochi and the Golden Giant, Zhou Wen now knew the strength of Orochi. It wouldn’t be difficult for Tyrant Behemoth to defeat Orochi.</p>
<p>It was a piece of cake. Not only could he get a high ranking, but it could also frighten everyone. It could also attack the evil ones overseas. It was killing three birds with one stone. Why not?</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth and allowed it to ascend the cube to challenge Orochi.</p>
<p>“Are you finally coming out?” Uesugi Nao looked at Tyrant Behemoth on the cube’s screen and chose to accept the challenge without any hesitation.</p>
<p>She knew that Tyrant Behemoth’s owner must have studied Orochi for a long time. However, she was confident that with Orochi’s characteristics, it could definitely restrain Tyrant Behemoth. Under her command, it definitely wouldn’t lose.</p>
<p>The entire world’s media saw that Orochi had accepted the challenge. Instantly, all the major channels and online platforms were livestreaming the cube’s screen.</p>
<p>A little boy held his mother’s hand and stood in front of the big screen on the street. He asked worriedly, “Can Tyrant Behemoth win?”</p>
<p>“He will definitely win,” his mother consoled him gently.</p>
<p>“But we’ve already lost twice.” The boy was still somewhat worried.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. No matter how many times we lose, there will always be heroes in the Federation who can step forward to save the world. Perhaps that hero is Tyrant Behemoth,” said his mother.</p>
<p>The boy didn’t say anything. He only clenched his fist and looked at the big screen nervously.</p>
<p>Boom! Orochi landed in the arena. Its huge body was ferocious and terrifying. The eight snakeheads raised together as its eerie snake eyes stared intently at Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth maintained a height of a few meters and didn’t gigantify. Compared to the massive Orochi, it appeared somewhat weak. However, everyone knew that Tyrant Behemoth could still gigantify. Its body wouldn’t be smaller than Orochi.</p>
<p>To everyone’s surprise, Tyrant Behemoth didn’t transform. Instead, it leaped up and punched one of Orochi’s heads.</p>
<h3 id='chapter650'>Chapter 650: What Others Think of a Tyrant</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Orochi didn’t underestimate its enemy. The eight snakeheads spewed out Essence Energy projectiles of different attributes at the same time. The seven tails also danced wildly as they lashed at Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>“Roar!” A roar shook the world. A crown appeared on Tyrant Behemoth’s head. Although it didn’t expand, its entire body was bathed in bloody red light as though it had been enhanced by some magical power.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth constantly threw out its fists like a storm. The Essence Energy projectiles that Orochi spewed out were blasted apart by Tyrant Behemoth’s fists akin to exploding fireworks.</p>
<p>When the seven snake tails touched its fist, they emitted a terrifying metallic clang as they were sent flying. The scales on its tail shattered.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth rushed in front of Orochi and punched its head, sending its entire body flying.</p>
<p>Orochi tumbled far away before stopping. As for the snakehead which had been hit, it was mostly crushed by the terrifying augmentation of the crown.</p>
<p>“Impressive, it’s even stronger than the Golden Giant. As expected of Behemoth!”</p>
<p>“Such strength is really amazing. I’m afraid no Companion Beast can match it in terms of strength.”</p>
<p>The boy pulled his mother’s hand and exclaimed excitedly, “Mommy… Tyrant Behemoth is amazing… It’s really powerful…”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“That’s right. It’s really very powerful.” His mother smiled and nodded, but she was still somewhat worried.</p>
<p>This was because she knew very well that Orochi’s true trump card had yet to be used. And the snake tail with a terrifying sword beam was the nemesis of Strength-type Companion Beasts like Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Many people were equally worried. Orochi’s tail sword beam was just too powerful. Up to now, no Companion Beast had been able to withstand a strike from that tail.</p>
<p>Although Tyrant Behemoth displayed overwhelming strength, it was difficult to say if one could withstand the attack of the snake tail.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao didn’t keep them hanging in suspense. At the instant Tyrant Behemoth charged over again, that snake tail suddenly raised. It tore through the void with a cold sword beam, slashing at Tyrant Behemoth’s body.</p>
<p>Everyone knew that the moment to decide victory was coming. If Tyrant Behemoth couldn’t withstand the snake tail’s slash, it would definitely lose.</p>
<p>Everyone wanted to know if Tyrant Behemoth, who could swallow Chimera, could swallow the terrifying sword beam.</p>
<p>When the boy saw the sword beam formed by the snake’s tail, he nervously grabbed the corner of his mother’s clothes. He had already seen the same scene once. The Golden Giant was defeated by the snake tail’s sword beam despite holding the advantage. All it could do was escape with its tail in between its legs and admit defeat.</p>
<p>However, to everyone’s surprise, Tyrant Behemoth didn’t use the Mountain Consuming Skill. Instead, it continued brandishing its fist once again to meet the shocking sword beam formed by the snake’s tail.</p>
<p>At that instant, Tyrant Behemoth’s body seemed to shrink again. The strange red glow on its body also turned black-red. Tyrant Behemoth’s entire body seemed to turn into a black hole. The light couldn’t escape when it landed on its body.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth collided with the sword beam and the sword beam immediately shattered. The fist directly collided with the snake’s tail.</p>
<p>The indestructible snake tail wasn’t able to cleave apart Tyrant Behemoth’s fist. It only left a sword mark.</p>
<p>“Heavens, ladies and gentlemen, did you see that? Orochi’s killer blow wasn’t able to cleave apart Tyrant Behemoth’s fist! The terrifying killing technique that nearly killed the Golden Giant only left a sword mark on Tyrant Behemoth’s fist. Such injuries can’t affect Tyrant Behemoth’s combat strength at all…” Some of the more emotional commentators shouted.</p>
<p>“Mommy, it blocked it! It blocked the huge snake’s tail!” The boy cried out excitedly.</p>
<p>Before his mother could reply, Tyrant Behemoth had already grabbed the snake’s tail and used all its strength to fling Orochi away.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Orochi was slammed to the ground. Before Orochi could react, Tyrant Behemoth slammed it left and right using its tail, smashing Orochi’s body to the ground like a sandbag.</p>
<p>In a few moves, it shattered most of its bones, as though it had turned into a pool of soft flesh. The snake heads went limp.</p>
<p>“It’s too violent and too bloody. Orochi isn’t a match for Tyrant Behemoth at all. It’s constantly being ravaged.”</p>
<p>“Oh my God, I can’t believe my eyes. Is that still the terrifying Orochi? In front of Tyrant Behemoth, it’s nothing.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. Kill it and let those overseas fellows know our Federation’s true strength.”</p>
<p>“It’s too tragic. After this battle, I don’t think those reptiles will be able to open their mouths and spit out words again. I can’t tell how many heads it has left or if they have all been smashed by Tyrant Behemoth.”</p>
<p>All the media’s announcers began to cheer up. One by one, they began to tease each other. They no longer had the stern expression they had during their previous criticism. Their choice of words also began to become humorous as all sorts of coquettish comments flew around.</p>
<p>In comparison, there were more people in the audience. Many people who were watching online posted a large number of comments.</p>
<p>“Orochi is considering which head to use to call for help. Oh, I’m sorry. I forgot that it has no hands. What should it do?”</p>
<p>“Daddy, stop beating me. I know I’m wrong.”</p>
<p>“Mommy, love me again.”</p>
<p>“Please make way. I don’t want to just watch the bullet comments. Give me some screen estate. I want to see if Orochi is dead.”</p>
<p>Everything happened too quickly. Uesugi Nao never expected that the power of Orochi’s Wheel of Destiny could not even slice apart Tyrant Behemoth’s fist.</p>
<p>She wanted to admit defeat and retrieve Orochi, but she felt as though it was being sucked in by a terrifying force. She was unable to summon it back.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Another heavy blow was delivered as Orochi’s body slammed into the arena. Orochi already seemed completely boneless as it collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth roared as its body instantly expanded to the size of a small mountain. It was even taller and more majestic than Orochi. It raised Orochi’s tail and threw it into its mouth.</p>
<p>A strange spirit body appeared over Uesugi Nao. Her entire body emitted a demonic glow as she suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood. Her face instantly turned pale, but she finally retracted Orochi.</p>
<p>In the arena, Tyrant Behemoth’s fangs bit into nothing. Orochi’s body vanished, but this no longer affected the Federation’s citizens’ revelry.</p>
<p>“Dear viewers, thank you for witnessing this great moment with me. Tyrant Behemoth lives up to its name as a tyrant. It is deserving of its title as the king of Companion Beasts, the nightmare of all enemies. What others think of a tyrant, I think of as a king. Your Majesty, Tyrant Behemoth, thank you for bringing us such an exciting battle…”</p>
<h3 id='chapter651'>Chapter 651: Endless Sea of Stars</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>My Behemoth… My Behemoth… That’s my Behemoth… Zhang Xiao’s resentment increased to infinite proportions. That should have been his Companion Beast.</p>
<p>The entire Federation was guessing who Tyrant Behemoth’s owner was. Most people guessed that Tyrant Behemoth might be from the Family Clan of Gods or the Cape family.</p>
<p>The people from the West District were also proud of this, indicating that they could still rely on their West District Companion Beasts at critical moments.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Tyrant Behemoth win, its name replacing Orochi’s fourth place, the boy jumped up and cheered. He tugged his mother’s hand and shouted, “Mommy, it won. It really won.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it won.” His mother smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>“Mommy, I also want to have a Tyrant Behemoth.” The little boy looked at his mother with a look of longing.</p>
<p>His mother rubbed the boy’s head. “Strong Companion Beasts are unique. Tyrant Behemoth is such a Companion Beast. When you grow up, you will definitely have a powerful Companion Beast like Tyrant Behemoth.”</p>
<p>“Definitely. I can’t wait to grow up. But before that, Mom, can you buy me a Tyrant Behemoth plushie?” The boy looked at his mother with anticipation.</p>
<p>His mother laughed. “Of course. If you can’t buy it, we’ll produce it ourselves. You can help with the design.”</p>
<p>“Really? That’s great. I will definitely design the perfect Tyrant Behemoth plushie.” The boy’s eyes lit up with excitement.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>The major media outlets reported Tyrant Behemoth’s victory using all sorts of praises. They didn’t hesitate to use plenty of exaggerated words.</p>
<p>The titles of the strongest Companion Beast in the world, the ultimate violent battle pet, the strongest pet on the surface, and so on were bestowed to Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Although everyone knew that the Primordial Sword Immortal was still the strongest Companion Beast at present, most of the Federation acknowledged Tyrant Behemoth psychologically because it had won a special battle in a special period of time. This psychological recognition was related to its strength, but it wasn’t absolutely equal.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if there were three Companion Beasts like Primordial Sword Immortal and Death of the Underworld ranked ahead of it, it didn’t affect the Federation’s citizens to view Tyrant Behemoth as the Federation’s number one battle pet.</p>
<p>As for the six families, they increased their investigations, hoping to find the owner.</p>
<p>This battle made them see how terrifying Tyrant Behemoth was. It was a terrifying strength that could really vie for first place.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen’s Tyrant Behemoth is really terrifying. It looks like he has the chance to vie for first place,” An Sheng said with a smile.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo sat there reading the documents as though he hadn’t heard An Sheng.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally didn’t know much of the developments. He retracted Tyrant Behemoth and entered the desert under Liu Yun’s guidance.</p>
<p>Not long after leaving Hat City, the mysterious phone vibrated. Zhou Wen took out his phone to take a look and realized that the download of Netherworld City had been completed. The icon of Netherworld City appeared on the home screen.</p>
<p>Liu Yun led the turtle forward while Zhou Wen sat at the back. Without anything to do, he launched the dungeon to see what was different between the game’s Netherworld City and the real one.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar appeared at the entrance of Netherworld City. The door’s ghost faces said identical words to the ones in real life. Then, the door automatically opened.</p>
<p>He controlled the blood-colored avatar to enter Netherworld City and stepped on the stone slabs on the long street. He saw the number “366” appear on the stone slab. It was the same as entering Netherworld City in real life.</p>
<p>The only difference was that in-game, the blood-colored avatar was the only one on the long street of Netherworld City. No one else existed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen attempted to activate Gods Retreat. Just like in reality, a large number of taboo powers were immediately sucked into the jade infant’s body, allowing its evolution.</p>
<p>Since he didn’t have to worry about death in-game, Zhou Wen decided to give it a try and see if he would really die after using up all his steps.</p>
<p>It didn’t disappoint Zhou Wen. After the number of steps on the stone slab dropped to zero, Gods Retreat could only keep the blood-colored avatar safe for a few seconds before it exploded and died. The power was completely unreasonable and there was no way to defend against it.</p>
<p>After entering Netherworld City again, the blood-colored avatar appeared at the beginning of the long street. Before the torture chamber opened, Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to farm dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Although the dimensional creatures here were only at the Epic stage, their skills were rather interesting. Zhou Wen planned on grinding some Companion Eggs so that he could use them for pet fusion in the future.</p>
<p>Or perhaps he could grind some Essence Energy Skill Crystals. If he could use them, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to learn the skills himself.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s movement technique was considered top-notch among humans, but it was still lacking in other aspects. Apart from the Demonic Astral Wheel, there was no special skill that could be used.</p>
<p>City Lord Netherworld said that one can see the real Netherworld City after experiencing all the punishments. What does that mean? Zhou Wen was still guessing the meaning of the sentence.</p>
<p>An hour later, the torture chambers opened, but Zhou Wen realized a problem.</p>
<p>Although the white ghosts in-game were afraid of the Hell King Life Soul, they didn’t have any intelligence. It was impossible for them to help Zhou Wen cheat like in reality.</p>
<p>After all, a game is just a game. It has its limitations. It’s too rigid. Zhou Wen was somewhat helpless. There was no way to cheat. If he wanted to reach the end of Netherworld City, he could only suffer the punishment himself.</p>
<p>However, the blood-colored avatar shared a special relationship with him. He also felt pain when the blood-colored avatar was tortured.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen gave up on his previous plan. He only treated Netherworld City as a place to grind Companion Eggs and Essence Energy Skills.</p>
<p>Thankfully, no accidents happened this time. Two days later, Zhou Wen finally saw the Endless Sea of Stars that Liu Yun had mentioned.</p>
<p>“Are you sure this is the Endless Sea of Stars?” Zhou Wen looked ahead in disbelief. He couldn’t believe that this was the Endless Sea of Stars.</p>
<p>In front of him was a small lake. Although it looked clear, artificial lakes in parks were much bigger than it. How could such a place be called the Endless Sea of Stars?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t see any stars here. There wasn’t even a fish in the water. Furthermore, the lake was very shallow, so he could see the bottom at a glance. There was sand below, nothing else.</p>
<p>No matter how one looked at it, it didn’t look unfathomable like Liu Yun described—a place where most people died if they entered.</p>
<p>Liu Yun sat by the lake and took off his shoes. He extended his feet into the lake and said with a pleasant expression, “Calm down. Wait till night time and take another look. You will then know how magical the Endless Sea of Stars is.”</p>
<p>At night, the stars in the sky twinkled. The sky was especially clear, and the stars looked as though they would fall at any moment.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen saw a star really fall from the sky. Furthermore, it was falling towards them.</p>
<h3 id='chapter652'>Chapter 652: Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Monument</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>A meteor descended from the sky and landed on the lake, illuminating the entire lake.</p>
<p>What was strange was that the seemingly blazing-fast meteor rushed into the lake without causing any ripples on the water.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could clearly see what was happening underwater, he saw stars fall from the sky. A meteor shower ensued as the meteors headed for the tiny lake, forming a magnificent scene.</p>
<p>“Are those really meteors?” Zhou Wen couldn’t be sure. The starlight fell into the lake, but the surface of the lake was calm. It was like a boundless starry sky that could envelop everything.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to make a wish? Isn’t it said that if you can tie a knot in the corner of your clothes before the meteor disappears, the wish you make will come true? Junior Brother, you can give it a try,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head and said, “In our hometown, there’s no such thing as making wishes under a shooting star. Furthermore, there are taboos that shooting stars are jinxes. It’s inauspicious to see them. It might be unlucky.”</p>
<p>“Pui, pui, pui. Can’t you say something auspicious?” Liu Yun said gloomily.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shrugged and didn’t say another word as he looked at the lake.</p>
<p>The starlight that resembled a river of stars cascaded down and fell into the lake, forming points of light in the lake. It was as though countless stars were inside the lake. It was really like a sea of stars.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen focused on the points of light, he was surprised to discover that they were tiny orbs that resembled planets—miniature planets. The entire lake was like a starry universe with countless celestial bodies.</p>
<p>What was even stranger was that the planet-like orbs were still revolving according to a certain pattern.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder this place is called the Endless Sea of Stars! Looking at the starlight that kept falling into the lake, Zhou Wen finally knew the reason behind this tiny lake’s name.</p>
<p>Liu Yun said with a smile, “Don’t underestimate such a lake. There are countless stars inside. If you enter the lake now, you will be sucked into the sea of stars. It’s very likely that you will forever be lost in it and never come out again.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked around, but he didn’t see the tiny palm symbol. Therefore, he asked Liu Yun, “How are you going to enter the Endless Sea of Stars? Where is the Astral Combat Beast?”</p>
<p>“The Astral Combat Beasts are on those orbs. They look small, but once we enter the lake, we will discover that they are planets. There are all sorts of terrifying Astral Beasts on them, ranging from the Mortal stage to the Mythical stage. The Astral Combat Beast is one of the Mythical Astral Beasts.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Liu Yun continued, “After the meteor shower stops, we can go down. However, you have to follow me. Don’t fall, otherwise, you will be lost in the sea of stars and enter some strange planets. It will be difficult for you to come out again.”</p>
<p>“I’ll just look around outside for now then.” Zhou Wen slowly walked around the lake, hoping to see if there was a tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>As the lake was very small, he circled it in half an hour, but he didn’t find the tiny palm symbol. Now that the sea of stars had appeared, he might discover something.</p>
<p>The interior of the lake was like a starry universe, but it was still the same size outside. It felt rather enthralling.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen circled the lake and carefully looked at every inch of land, but he still couldn’t find the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>Just as he was feeling disappointed, his gaze suddenly swept across a stone monument at the bottom of the lake. It was lying flat with many star patterns on it, like a star chart.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pointed at the stone monument at the bottom of the lake and asked Liu Yun, “What’s that?”</p>
<p>“That is the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Monument. As long as you can figure out the profundity of the star chart on it, you will be able to comprehend the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art. This is also the key to me comprehending Star Stealer,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Liu Yun knew that it wasn’t that easy to comprehend the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Monument. Not only did he need extremely high perceptivity, but he also needed a special physique.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have a special physique that matched the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art, even if he did, he was already at the Epic stage. He probably couldn’t change his Essence Energy Art and try again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t too interested in Essence Energy Arts. He couldn’t finish cultivating too many Essence Energy Arts. Simulating them wasn’t difficult, but it was very difficult to level them up.</p>
<p>However, since the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art was necessary for Star Stealer, Zhou Wen planned on giving it a try to use the Lost Immortal Sutra to simulate it.</p>
<p>After circulating the Lost Immortal Sutra, Zhou Wen carefully sized up the stone monument. The star chart on the stone monument kept changing, making it difficult to figure out what it meant.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there were no words on it. It was perplexing.</p>
<p>Liu Yun actually managed to figure out an Essence Energy Art from such a star chart. He’s really a genius. When Zhou Wen carefully sized up the star chart, he had an unexpected discovery.</p>
<p>On the corner of the stone monument, there was a tiny palm symbol. The stars on the stone monument were shimmering but the palm symbol was engraved in a corner, covered in moss. With the lake water separating them, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have been able to see it if it wasn’t for the starlight’s illumination.</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother, can we see the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Monument during the day?” Zhou Wen asked Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“The stone monument is naturally still there during the day, but you can’t see the starlight flowing on it during the day. It’s just a blank stone monument. It’s useless even if you see it.” Seeing that the meteor shower had ended, Liu Yun said to Zhou Wen, “Alright, let’s head down now.”</p>
<p>“I’ve thought about it. The Endless Sea of Stars is so dangerous. My luck has been very bad recently. I’ve seen an ominous phenomenon, so I think I won’t head in. If you go down, help me see if you can obtain the Astral Combat Beast’s Essence Energy Skill Crystal,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, that wasn’t what you said before? Didn’t you say that people shouldn’t hide at home just because of bad luck… Why are you suddenly superstitious?” Liu Yun looked at Zhou Wen with a puzzled expression.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, I didn’t have the tiny palm symbol previously, so I naturally had to take the risk. Now that I’ve found the tiny palm symbol, I can return home to comfortably grind dungeons after downloading the game. Why would I take the risk?</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen couldn’t tell Liu Yun that. Therefore, he said, “Actually, I just wanted to take a look at this Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Monument. Since I can see it from here, there’s no need for me to enter. If you want to head in, go ahead. If you don’t wish to enter, just stay around to look at the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Monument with me.”</p>
<p>Liu Yun cursed inwardly. I don’t know how many thousand times I’ve stared at this crappy monument, so why would I continue looking at it? You don’t have my Heavenly Star Veins Body, so what will you be able to figure out? Even if you were to look at it for ten thousand years, you wouldn’t be able to comprehend the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art.</p>
<p>The reason Liu Yun was able to comprehend the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art back then was that the star chart on the stone monument had triggered his Heavenly Star Veins. Only by allowing the Heavenly Star Veins sense the trajectories of the stars could one gain insight.</p>
<p>Without the Heavenly Star Veins, just looking at the star chart was useless.</p>
<h3 id='chapter653'>Chapter 653: Planet Devourer</h3>
<p>“Alright then. Take your time. However, don’t go down to the lake alone. It wasn’t easy for me to make the trip here. I’ll go down and hunt some Astral Beasts. If I’m lucky, I’ll be able to have an Essence Energy Skill Crystal drop from killing Astral Combat Beasts. I’ll exchange it for my autograph.” Liu Yun walked into the lake.</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother, be careful,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t be so unlucky without you by my side,” Liu Yun said as he went into the water.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched as Liu Yun entered the lake. The lake appeared shallow, but when Liu Yun stepped into the water, his body kept sinking as though the bottom was nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>Furthermore, his body shrank as he descended. Finally, he floated towards the orbs like a speck of dust, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>What a magical dimensional zone. When it’s daytime, I’ll go down to the lake to take a picture of the tiny palm symbol. After downloading the Endless Star Sea dungeon, I’ll be able to farm it as I wish. Zhou Wen sat down by the lake and carefully observed the star chart on the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Monument.</p>
<p>After looking at it for a while, the Lost Immortal Sutra showed its effects. The circulation of Essence Energy became slower and slower before completely stopping.</p>
<p>After that, his Essence Energy suddenly surged and circulated in Zhou Wen’s body in a new way.</p>
<p>The Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art was different from the Essence Energy Arts Zhou Wen had cultivated in the past. It was a very magical feeling. It felt as though the Essence Energy in his body had transformed into countless stars that circulated in his body. Furthermore, when it circulated, it wasn’t a linear movement. Instead, it was like a true celestial body’s trajectory that formed a galaxy.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for Zhou Wen to gain a basic mastery of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art. However, it wasn’t that simple to level it up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to cultivate. It was useless to be anxious. This wasn’t something that could be mastered in a day or two.</p>
<p>He found a rock by the lake and sat down. He took out his phone and started to grind. He would head down to the lake to take a picture of the tiny palm symbol during the day.</p>
<p>There was still plenty of time until daybreak after Zhou Wen cleared one dungeon. Liu Yun hadn’t returned.</p>
<p>He stood up and stretched his body. He looked at the Endless Sea of Stars and realized that there was something strange in it.</p>
<p>During the day, Zhou Wen had observed it very carefully. The lake was somewhat odd. There were no creatures inside. There were no worms or water plants, much less fish or shrimp. The entire lake was as clean as pure water.</p>
<p>But now, Zhou Wen saw a creature that resembled a jellyfish in the lake. Its body was transparent like crystal, and it emitted light like a light bulb.</p>
<p>The jellyfish-like creature rose and fell in the lake. When it passed the tiny planet-like orbs, it would actually swallow them into its body.</p>
<p>Although the jellyfish wasn’t big and was only one size bigger than an adult’s clenched fist, if the celestial bodies were considered planets, then the size of the jellyfish was somewhat terrifying.</p>
<p>This thing can actually devour planets? Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. This was because he realized that the jellyfish was very close to the region where Liu Yun was.</p>
<p>If the orb where Liu Yun is gets swallowed by the jellyfish, would Liu Yun die? Zhou Wen looked at the jellyfish moving in the water. Although it was very slow, it was moving closer and closer to Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Could Eldest Senior Brother end up dying just like that? Zhou Wen was somewhat worried, but there was nothing he could do.</p>
<p>There are just too many orbs in the lake; it’s like a sea of stars. I only know the general direction Liu Yun took, but I don’t know which orb he’s on. It’s too late even if I head in now.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Overlord Sword and slashed out a sword beam at the jellyfish in the lake.</p>
<p>However, the moment the sword beam entered the lake, it became smaller and smaller. In the end, it was as tiny as a needle tip. It vanished when it was still a distance away from the jellyfish.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the sword beam had become so tiny. Even if it struck the jellyfish, it wouldn’t be of much use.</p>
<p>Eldest Senior Brother, Eldest Senior Brother… It’s not that I don’t want to save you, but I really can’t. Zhou Wen slashed a few more times, but to no avail. All he could do was watch helplessly as the jellyfish approached the area where Liu Yun was.</p>
<p>It’s over! The jellyfish soon arrived at the area where Liu Yun was and swallowed the nearby orbs.</p>
<p>When the orbs entered its body, they were like glowing jelly beans that spun around its body before slowly melting until they vanished.</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother, Eldest Senior Brother, I didn’t expect you to die like this. You didn’t even leave any clothes behind. I can’t even make a cenotaph for you…”</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was sighing, he suddenly heard a whoosh. Liu Yun emerged from the lake, looking extremely disheveled. His clothes looked as though they were made of paper, turning into paste when touching the water.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, are you messing with me again? Are you trying to burn bridges and make me die down there?” Liu Yun jumped onto the shore and questioned Zhou Wen angrily.</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother, what do you mean? I saw the monster in the water devouring the orbs and wanted to save you, but all the attacks that hit the water became insignificant. I had no choice,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“If you weren’t behind this, why would I be so unlucky to encounter a Planet Devourer? That thing doesn’t usually appear,” Liu Yun said with widened eyes.</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother, you’ve really misunderstood me. I’m not familiar with this area. I still need you to take me out of this desert. Even if I wanted to do something to you, I wouldn’t choose this moment. Besides, if I wanted to mess with you, I don’t need to secretly do it, right? I knew it. It’s not auspicious after seeing an ominous phenomenon,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Liu Yun found that what he said made sense and couldn’t help but say gloomily, “Why am I so unlucky at the moment? I clearly didn’t see the Planet Devourer before I went down. Thankfully, I have deceptive skills. Otherwise, I would have died even if I had ten lives.”</p>
<p>“What is that Planet Devourer? It should be a Mythical creature, right? Can it really devour a planet?” Zhou Wen was rather curious about the jellyfish-like Planet Devourer.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if it can devour a planet in real life, but in the Endless Sea of Stars, that fellow is an overlord. No matter what kind of Astral Beast it is, it can devour them in one mouthful. Even the celestial bodies inside the Endless Sea of Stars are no exception. However, the celestial bodies in the Endless Sea of Stars are much smaller than real planets. I reckon that the Planet Devourer can only devour mountains outside the Endless Sea of Stars,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“Do you think my Tyrant Behemoth can kill it?” Zhou Wen pondered.</p>
<p>“Probably not. Tyrant Behemoth isn’t good at aquatic warfare, right?” Liu Yun looked at the Planet Devourer in the lake and said.</p>
<p>“I really don’t know.” Zhou Wen planned on letting Tyrant Behemoth try after he downloaded the dungeon.</p>
<p>As there was a Planet Devourer, Liu Yun didn’t dare enter the Endless Sea of Stars again. All he could do was stay by the lakeside with Zhou Wen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter654'>Chapter 654: Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Junior Brother, you’ve been staring at it for so long. Have you figured out anything?” Liu Yun sat beside him and asked in boredom.</p>
<p>“A little,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“How much is a little bit?” Liu Yun continued asking.</p>
<p>There was no way he could figure it out without having a physique that was compatible with the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Monument. Therefore, Liu Yun didn’t believe Zhou Wen’s words.</p>
<p>This had nothing to do with whether he was a genius or not. It didn’t even have much to do with his perceptivity. Without the Heavenly Star Veins, it was impossible to figure it out. This was the foundation, just like how one couldn’t build a skyscraper without a foundation. Zhou Wen had no chance of figuring out the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting.</p>
<p>“Just a little,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>Liu Yun curled his lips and didn’t ask any more. Zhou Wen kept staring at the Endless Sea of Stars, hoping to see what else there was in the sea of stars other than the Planet Devourer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, apart from the Planet Devourer, there were no other dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>“Besides this Planet Devourer, is there no other dimensional creature in the Endless Sea of Stars?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“There are Astral Beasts on those small planets, but they are only active on the planets and are unable to leave them. Outside the small planets, there’s only one Planet Devourer. It’s the king here. It pops a planet with each bite, devouring even the dimensional creatures on it. It’s an invincible existence. I am good at deception, so I managed to escape. If it were another person—even if the six heroes were revived—they wouldn’t be able to escape its devouring,” Liu Yun said smugly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched for a while and felt bored. He took out his phone and gamed, grinding Mythical creatures and rare dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>“If you are done watching, let’s go back. Although we won’t encounter danger if we do not enter the Endless Sea of Stars, who knows when something might happen in a place like a desert. The two of us have been unlucky recently. It’s best we return soon,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“I want to go underwater to take a look at the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Monument during the day. Perhaps I might discover something,” Zhou Wen said half-truthfully.</p>
<p>Liu Yun curled his lips and said, “Junior Brother, don’t blame me for being blunt. If you can’t figure it out at night, what would you figure out in the day? There will not be any starlight chart in the day, it’ll be a bare and dilapidated monolith.”</p>
<p>“I came all the way here. I’m not willing to give up if I don’t take a look,” Zhou Wen said, unmoved.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s wait until you are done looking at it in the morning. I’ll sleep for a while. Wake me up later.” Liu Yun lay down and fell asleep. He was asleep in less than three seconds.</p>
<p>His sleeping posture was very strange. Zhou Wen felt that he was like a cat that could bounce up from the ground at any moment.</p>
<p>After taking a closer look, he realized that Liu Yun’s sleeping posture was extraordinary. No matter which direction he was attacked from, his posture allowed him to easily react to it.</p>
<p>To be able to develop such a sleeping posture, Liu Yun must have experienced many things in the past. How could a normal person be so wary when sleeping?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s senses were very sharp, but he wouldn’t maintain a combat-ready sleeping posture while sleeping because he didn’t have such a realization.</p>
<p>Of course, with Truth Listener around, it was impossible for ordinary people to get close to him without being discovered.</p>
<p>Although he had obtained quite a number of Companion Eggs after gaming the entire night, Zhou Wen didn’t get any he wanted. Medusa, Qiongqi, Torch Dragon, and company hadn’t dropped Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>That shouldn’t be the case. Every time I kill them, I bring the baby tiger with me. After killing them so many times, logically speaking, there should be one dropping? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>The night quickly passed. In the morning, the starlight in the lake surged into the sky like a stream and vanished into the void. The lake returned to normal.</p>
<p>It looked like an ordinary lake. It was unimaginable that it would turn into a starry sky at night.</p>
<p>Liu Yun didn’t lie to him. The Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Monument was still in the lake. Zhou Wen woke Liu Yun up and asked if there was anything to take note of when entering the lake.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing. As long as you aren’t going into the lake at night, this lake isn’t much different from ordinary lakes.” Liu Yun shook his head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried going into the water. Indeed, it wasn’t as miraculous as last night. He stepped into the lake, and the water only reached his waist.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had learned the Nine Dragons Art from the black dragon. He dived into the water and quickly arrived at the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Monument.</p>
<p>Just as Liu Yun had said, in the day, this was a worn stone monument that was covered in moss. There were only scratches on it, and there was no starlight pattern. If it wasn’t for the tiny palm symbol engraved on it, it wouldn’t be eye-catching at all.</p>
<p>At a close distance, the mysterious phone vibrated. Zhou Wen picked up his phone and snapped a picture of the stone monument. The phone immediately entered the download interface.</p>
<p>After putting away his phone, Zhou Wen touched the stone monument again. It felt cold like it was made of metal.</p>
<p>Not daring to do anything excessive, he turned around and swam back to the shore.</p>
<p>“How is it, Junior Brother? Did you figure out anything?” Liu Yun asked Zhou Wen with a smile.</p>
<p>“A little,” Zhou Wen said with a nod.</p>
<p>“You figured out a little yesterday, and you figured out a little today. Added together, it will be impressive. You should have gained basic mastery, right?” Liu Yun teased Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve gotten basic mastery,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>Liu Yun, who was drinking water, nearly choked. He looked at Zhou Wen in disbelief and asked, “Are you for real? You really gained basic mastery?”</p>
<p>“It’s just basic mastery. What’s so difficult about it? Haven’t you long obtained basic mastery?” Zhou Wen said casually.</p>
<p>Liu Yun refused to believe him. He reached out and grabbed a handful of sand from the ground. With a squeeze, the sand condensed into a ball that looked like a huge grain of sand.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s hand relaxed again. The huge sand scattered and turned into yellow sand.</p>
<p>“If you really gained basic mastery, you should be able to do this, right?” Liu Yun said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I’ll give it a try.” Zhou Wen also grabbed a handful of sand from the ground. He circulated the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art and pinched the sand. The sand stuck together like magnets, turning into a ball. However, it wasn’t as round as Liu Yun’s.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t… You’ve really gained basic mastery of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art?” Liu Yun widened his eyes as he looked at Zhou Wen as though he had seen a ghost.</p>
<p>“Why would I lie to you?” Zhou Wen released his hand and the sand scattered.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ve already achieved my goal. Let’s head back. After we leave the desert, I’ll return the autograph to you,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, you’re really a genius in cultivation, but how did you do it? According to what I know, cultivating the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art requires a special physique. You don’t look like you have a special physique.” Liu Yun was puzzled. He had the Heavenly Star Veins himself, so he naturally knew what characteristics one needed to have. Zhou Wen didn’t have those characteristics.</p>
<p>“Do I need a special physique? I don’t know about that. I just casually practiced it and attained basic mastery. I didn’t find it difficult,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Liu Yun felt something stuck in his throat and couldn’t say another word.</p>
<h3 id='chapter655'>Chapter 655: Heart Lunar Fox</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Their journey back to the city was rather smooth. They didn’t encounter any sandstorms or Netherworld City when they walked by the areas they had previously passed.</p>
<p>After leaving the desert, Zhou Wen returned the autograph to Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, I’m afraid the entire world is looking for Tyrant Behemoth’s master. Aren’t you afraid that I will leak your secret?” Liu Yun looked at Zhou Wen with a complicated expression after confirming that it was his signature.</p>
<p>“Although we haven’t spent much time together and I don’t know you well, I believe you aren’t the type of person to do such things.” Although Zhou Wen said that, he was thinking, It doesn’t matter if it’s really exposed. I don’t only have one trump card in my hand. Since I’ve placed it on the rankings, I’m already mentally prepared to expose myself.</p>
<p>“I like hearing what you said. Don’t worry. After all, you are my junior brother. As a senior brother, I won’t harm you. I will help you keep the secret,” said Liu Yun with a smile. It was unknown if he was telling the truth.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s go our separate ways here. I should return as well.” Zhou Wen planned on going separate ways with Liu Yun and returning to the town as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The ranking battle hadn’t ended. Tyrant Behemoth was only ranked fourth, so it should still have a chance to make further challenges.</p>
<p>Liu Yun clearly didn’t wish to continue being with Zhou Wen. Ever since he met Zhou Wen, his luck had been terrible. He seriously suspected that it was a result of the two blades on Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, I don’t know when we will meet again after today. Here’s a farewell song…” Liu Yun said generously.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen nodded. He never expected Liu Yun to actually know how to sing.</p>
<p>“Beautiful ladies… Ladies… Ladies have walked into1…” Liu Yun sat on the turtle’s back and sang loudly. The turtle ran quickly and soon vanished from sight. Only his delicate voice echoed in Zhou Wen’s ears.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was rendered speechless. He originally imagined what kind of song it was, but it turned out to be such a folk song.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Liu Yun’s singing was really charming. It made one have the urge to beat him up.</p>
<p>After Liu Yun’s voice could no longer be heard, Zhou Wen summoned Six-Winged and rode it back. Although it was uncomfortable, he had to make do with it.</p>
<p>As he traveled, Zhou Wen launched the downloaded Endless Sea of Stars dungeon.</p>
<p>In fact, the dungeon had long been downloaded. However, with Liu Yun around, Zhou Wen didn’t dare launch it.</p>
<p>After opening the Endless Sea of Stars dungeon, the blood-colored avatar appeared in a starry sky. There were planets around it, but they didn’t look as huge as real planets.</p>
<p>These planets were about the same size as mountains. However, on these small planets, there was no distinction between the top and bottom, left and right. On a nearby planet, a group of mutated beasts could be seen running across it. Many of them looked like they were running upside down, appearing as though they would fall off at any time.</p>
<p>If it was a real planet, it wouldn’t be too obvious because of a planet’s immense size.</p>
<p>On such a small planet, the visual impact of seeing a group of mutated beasts standing upside down was extremely strong.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar and flew towards the planet. At the same time, he summoned Six-Winged and other Companion Beasts before charging at the mutated beasts.</p>
<p>The mutated beasts looked like humanoid mantises. After seeing the blood-colored avatar, they charged forward, but they were mostly killed by Six-Winged and Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>‘Killed Legendary Fiend Star Mantis… Killed Legendary Fiend Star Mantis…’</p>
<p>The notifications kept coming in. Many dimensional crystals dropped, including a few Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>However, such dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs weren’t of much use to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>He went to a few nearby small planets and realized that there were quite a number of Astral Beasts here, but most of them were at the Mortal and Legendary stage. Even Epic creatures were rare.</p>
<p>I forgot to ask Eldest Senior Brother Liu Yun which planet has the so-called Astral Combat Beast. There are thousands of planets here. I wonder how long it’ll take me to go through them one by one. Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. This was different from what he had imagined. He imagined that there were Mythical creatures everywhere in the Endless Sea of Stars.</p>
<p>There was no choice. It was impossible to find Liu Yun now. Zhou Wen could only slowly search each planet.</p>
<p>Thankfully, his Companion Beasts were very powerful. Killing a tiny planet’s Astral Beasts wasn’t difficult.</p>
<p>He didn’t find the Mythical Astral Combat Beast, but he discovered a strange Astral Beast.</p>
<p>It was a fox with crescent-shaped starlight shimmering on its chest. After Zhou Wen killed it, according to the notification, it was said to be a Mortal-stage Heart Lunar Fox.</p>
<p>Even if a Mortal dimensional creature dropped something, Zhou Wen usually didn’t think much of it.</p>
<p>The chances of a Mortal Companion Egg dropping were extremely low. It was almost the same as winning the lottery. Furthermore, it was useless for Zhou Wen to get a Mortal Companion Beast.</p>
<p>The Heart Lunar Fox didn’t drop a Companion Egg either. All it dropped was an Essence Energy Skill Crystal, but it was also very rare to drop one at the Mortal stage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hadn’t paid attention to the Mortal stage Essence Energy Skill, but when he saw its name, he was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>The Essence Energy Skill Crystal dropped by the Heart Lunar Fox wasn’t a Heart Lunar Fox Crystal, but an Azure Dragon Heart Crystal.</p>
<p>Heart Lunar Fox… I think I’ve heard of this name somewhere… Zhou Wen checked online and couldn’t help but be alarmed.</p>
<p>Few modern people knew the name of the Heart Lunar Fox, but in ancient times, it was one of the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions.</p>
<p>The twenty-eight Lunar Mansions were split equally amongst the Eastern Azure Dragon, the Northern Black Tortoise, the Southern Vermilion Bird, and the Western White Tiger—each having seven palaces.</p>
<p>The Heart Lunar Fox was one of the seven palaces of the Eastern Azure Dragon. It represented the heart.</p>
<p>This Heart Lunar Fox is only at the Mortal stage. Logically speaking, it shouldn’t be related to the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions. They are extremely powerful existences in myths and legends. They should at least be at the Mythical stage. Even if they aren’t at the Mythical stage, they shouldn’t be at the Mortal stage, right? However, the Essence Energy Skill Crystal dropped by the Heart Lunar Fox is actually called the Azure Dragon Heart Crystal. It doesn’t seem right if it’s unrelated.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and let the blood-colored avatar absorb the Azure Dragon Heart Crystal to see what Essence Energy Skill he would learn.</p>
<p>Typically, Mortal-stage Essence Energy Skill Crystals could be absorbed easily, but when Zhou Wen absorbed them, he realized that the Essence Energy Art wasn’t compatible.</p>
<p>A Mortal stage Essence Energy Skill actually requires an Essence Energy Art to match? This was the first time Zhou Wen had encountered something like this. He couldn’t help but feel intrigued.</p>
<p>After some thought, he changed his Essence Energy Art to Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting and absorbed the Azure Dragon Heart Crystal. This time, he successfully absorbed it.</p>
<p>This Essence Energy Skill was somewhat odd. Typical Essence Energy Skills opened up an Essence Energy circulation path in one’s body.</p>
<p>However, after the Azure Dragon Heart was absorbed, it condensed into a point in his body. It was motionless like a nail.</p>
<p>‘Absorbed the Azure Dragon Heart Crystal. Attained Essence Energy Skill: Heart Lunar Fox.’</p>
<h3 id='chapter656'>Chapter 656: Blood Oxypetalum</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen attempted to activate the Heart Lunar Fox skill, but there was no reaction.</p>
<p>If this skill really has something to do with the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions, could it be that I have to gather all the skills of the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions before I can use it? Or could it be that I can use it just by gathering the Azure Dragon’s seven palaces? Zhou Wen was just guessing. Up to now, there was no way to prove the relationship between the two.</p>
<p>As he had nothing to lose, Zhou Wen paid special attention to the Essence Energy Skill Crystal drops when grinding.</p>
<p>After grinding for half the day, he didn’t see any similar Mortal-stage Essence Energy Skills drop.</p>
<p>After respawning the dungeon, Zhou Wen went to the place where he discovered the Heart Lunar Fox, but he didn’t see it again.</p>
<p>Having had the experience of grinding the baby tiger, Zhou Wen knew that such matters couldn’t be forced. Therefore, he didn’t deliberately search for it. He only paid a little attention when grinding low-level monsters, with his main focus on finding Astral Combat Beasts.</p>
<p>After another day, Zhou Wen surprisingly discovered that he had obtained another Azure Dragon Heart Crystal. After absorbing it, he obtained the Room Solar Rabbit Essence Energy Skill.</p>
<p>However, just like the Heart Lunar Fox, the Room Solar Rabbit skill was useless.</p>
<p>It looks like there’s no mistake about the Heart Lunar Fox and the Room Solar Rabbit. It’s really related to the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions, but why are the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions such low-level dimensional creatures? Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out the reason, but he paid more attention when grinding.</p>
<p>By the time he returned to the town inside the Funiu Mountain Range, Zhou Wen had obtained some skill crystals related to the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions.</p>
<p>Among them, the number of Heart Lunar Foxes and Room Solar Rabbits were the highest. He had three of each, but they couldn’t be taken out, so they were useless.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these skills had no rank. There was no discernment between the same skills in terms of levels.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had also obtained the skill crystals of the Horn Wood Scaly Dragon, Root Earth Raccoon Dog, Tail Fire Tiger, and Winnowing-basket Water Leopard. These Mortal-stage dimensional creatures were also strange. There were very few of them, but as long as he found them, they would definitely drop skill crystals. Nothing else would drop.</p>
<p>The skill crystals that Zhou Wen had obtained were all from the Azure Dragon seven Lunar Mansions. He had already learned six skills and was only short of the Azure Dragon’s Neck Gold Dragon.</p>
<p>After reaching the small town, Zhou Wen looked at the ranking again and realized that no one had challenged Tyrant Behemoth. It was still ranked fourth.</p>
<p>In front of Tyrant Behemoth, there were still three Companion Beasts—Primordial Sword Immortal, Death of the Underworld, and Fairy Immortal Gu.</p>
<p>Why is no one challenging Primordial Sword Immortal? There should be less than a month left in the three-month deadline, right? Zhou Wen didn’t wish to be the trailblazer. He planned on returning to school first. It wouldn’t be too late for him to come again after someone challenged the Primordial Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>When he reached the town’s entrance, he suddenly heard a sound coming from outside. Using Truth Listener to investigate, he realized that a few people were heading for the town.</p>
<p>Eh… What are they doing here? Zhou Wen realized that Qiao Siyuan and Liz were among the people who had come.</p>
<p>Although they weren’t wearing the Special Inspector Bureau uniform, Zhou Wen had a deep impression of them, so he recognized them at a glance.</p>
<p>The others looked like they were from the bureau as well. Zhou Wen didn’t know why he had such a judgment, but he had a feeling that the people from the bureau seemed to have a special aura. This aura was very rare to find on ordinary people.</p>
<p>It was just like how soldiers could easily be identified. It was the same for the people from the bureau. However, their auras were different from ordinary soldiers.</p>
<p>This was originally a good opportunity to take revenge, but Zhou Wen wanted to figure out their reason for coming here. Therefore, he retreated into the forest and used Truth Listener to monitor their every move.</p>
<p>“Clear the area.” After entering the valley, Qiao Siyuan gave the order. Immediately, people took out various instruments and summoned their Companion Beasts. They began to busy themselves.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen recognized a few Companion Beasts that were probably reconnaissance types. From the looks of it, they wanted to ensure that there were no outsiders here.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen sneaked into the lake and hid in the water. Then, he used the Dao Body to converge his aura and blend with the surrounding natural environment.</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan and company busied themselves for a few hours, taking control of the entire valley. Only when they seemingly confirmed that there was no one else here did they transport quite a number of things from outside the town.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw Companion Beasts carrying buckets into the town. He didn’t know what was inside.</p>
<p>“Minister, we have finished counting the items,” Liz reported to Qiao Siyuan.</p>
<p>“Set up a sentry post and split into three shifts to monitor the situation outside. Everyone else, rest immediately,” Qiao Siyuan ordered.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Liz accepted the order and began dividing the group.</p>
<p>When Liz returned to Qiao Siyuan’s side, he had already sat down in a small building.</p>
<p>“Minister, is the Blood Oxypetalum really as magical as the legends say?” Liz poured a cup of tea for Qiao Siyuan and asked curiously.</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan took a sip of tea and said indifferently, “You should have heard of how instantaneous an oxypetalum blooming is, right?”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of it, but I heard that it’s just an exaggerated metaphor from the people of the East District. In fact, oxypetalum will bloom for a few hours. It’s not as exaggerated as if it only bloomed for an instant,” Liz said.</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan nodded. “It’s true that a normal oxypetalum blooming isn’t as exaggerated as being instantaneous, but it’s different if it’s a Blood Oxypetalum.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Qiao Siyuan continued, “To get a Blood Oxypetalum to bloom, one has to pour a large amount of blood. Typical blood isn’t enough. It has to be the blood essence of dimensional creatures. The more blood the Blood Oxypetalum absorbs, the purer it becomes. The flower that blooms will also become more beautiful. Furthermore, it can give birth to a Blood Oxypetalum seed.”</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen heard that, he recalled the ruby he had obtained.</p>
<p>Previously, many white deer had been sacrificed by the mountain god. Only then did a blood flower bloom in the lake, giving birth to a ruby. It sounded like the seed that Qiao Siyuan had mentioned.</p>
<p>If the flower in the lake is really a Blood Oxypetalum, then why did Qiao Siyuan and company come here? Are they planning to offer a blood sacrifice to obtain the Blood Oxypetalum seed? What’s its use? As Zhou Wen was thinking, Liz had already given him an answer.</p>
<p>“Minister, can a Blood Oxypetalum seed really change a person’s bloodline and talent?” Liz asked.</p>
<p>“That’s not something I know. I’ve never used a Blood Oxypetalum seed before, so I can’t make any judgment. However, since the director-general wants to do this, he must have his reasons,” Qiao Siyuan said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Minister, you’re right. The Director-General has put in so much effort this time to specially prepare this blood. If it really succeeds, the seed produced by the Blood Oxypetalum will definitely be extraordinary,” Liz said enviously.</p>
<h3 id='chapter657'>Chapter 657: Snatching the Seed Again</h3>
<p>1</p>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that Qiao Siyuan and company would take action soon, but to his surprise, they had only set up the place to appear air-tight. Even when a fly flew in, they had zero intention of taking action.</p>
<p>They are waiting for someone. Will Shen Yuchi come personally? Zhou Wen felt that it would be perfect if Shen Yuchi really came personally.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare barge into the Special Inspector Bureau’s headquarters, but if Shen Yuchi dared to come, Zhou Wen could try his best to see if he could retain him.</p>
<p>As there were many surveillance Companion Beasts and instruments placed by the lakeside, Zhou Wen hid in the water and didn’t dare move. Any abnormalities might be discovered.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>After enduring more than two days, he finally realized that someone had come to the town. What disappointed Zhou Wen was that the person who came wasn’t Shen Yuchi, but a man he didn’t know.</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan and Liz addressed him as Censor Cai very respectfully. Zhou Wen immediately realized the person was Cai Jin, one of the four Censors.</p>
<p>Cai Jin held a metal alloy box in his hand. There was a metal alloy chain on the box that connected to Cai Jin’s wrist.</p>
<p>The last time the Essence Crystal mine was robbed, the bureau suffered huge losses. Shen Yuchi had only punished Cai Jin lightly, making Cai Jin extremely grateful.</p>
<p>This time, he had been ordered to secretly come to Funiu Mountain. Cai Jin had also made sufficient preparations. No matter what, he couldn’t screw up this work trip.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Minister Qiao, how’s the defense set up here?” Cai Jin asked.</p>
<p>“We already have a whole range of defenses in place. We didn’t find any outsiders,” Qiao Siyuan replied.</p>
<p>“Very good. Let’s begin tomorrow,” Cai Jin said.</p>
<p>Liz asked curiously, “Censor, why aren’t you taking action tonight?”</p>
<p>“I’ve traveled a distance. I need to rest for the night to maintain my optimal condition. So it’s better to take action tomorrow,” Cai Jin explained.</p>
<p>However, after Cai Jin left Qiao Siyuan’s temporary office, he didn’t rest. Instead, he summoned numerous bee-like Companion Beasts that flew in all directions.</p>
<p>Clearly, Cai Jin wasn’t at ease with their defense. He had to do it again.</p>
<p>The people from the bureau are really very cautious. Zhou Wen saw Cai Jin circling the valley. He paid special attention to the woods and lake. He even summoned a water snake-like Companion Beast to search underwater.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen was prepared. He had dug a hole in the lake ahead of time and hid inside like a loach. It wasn’t easy for him to escape Cai Jin’s search.</p>
<p>Liz was very displeased with Cai Jin’s actions. “Censor Cai is doubting our abilities?”</p>
<p>However, Qiao Siyuan said indifferently, “It’s a serious matter. Better be safe than sorry.”</p>
<p>Cai Jin put up new defenses before returning to the temporary encampment to rest. It wasn’t until nightfall the next day that he got up and rushed to the lake with Qiao Siyuan and company.</p>
<p>The inspectors and various Companion Beasts had already surrounded the lake.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly thought of something. Their blood sacrifice would only last for a short period of time. That would mean that they would have to bring a lot of blood into the lake? Just the thought of the pool of blood made Zhou Wen feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>However, there were inspectors and Companion Beasts surrounding the lake. It was too late for Zhou Wen to leave.</p>
<p>“Minister Qiao, let’s begin,” Cai Jin said to Qiao Siyuan after arriving by the lake and summoning his Companion Beasts to search the area again.</p>
<p>“Liz.” Qiao Siyuan gestured at Liz.</p>
<p>Liz immediately got the inspectors to take action. The inspectors opened the buckets and poured the blood into the lake from different spots.</p>
<p>The buckets of blood quickly dyed the lake water red. Each bucket weighed five kilograms. They brought more than three hundred buckets of blood. If so much blood were to be poured in, the surroundings would be filled with a pungent smell of blood.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt terrible hiding in the water, but he could only endure it.</p>
<p>Thankfully, not long after, Zhou Wen saw the blood surge towards the center of the lake as though it was attracted by something.</p>
<p>Splash!</p>
<p>The Blood Oxypetalum surfaced out of the water. It greedily absorbed the blood in the water, and the snow-white petals quickly turned into the color of blood.</p>
<p>The blood in the lake was completely drained in less than an hour, restoring the lake to its former clarity.</p>
<p>However, the petals of the Blood Oxypetalum didn’t open, but there was a red glow in the flower bud.</p>
<p>Only then did Cai Jin open the box in his hand. Inside the huge box was a small bottle the size of a palm.</p>
<p>Cai Jin picked up the bottle and carefully opened it. A pair of eagle wings unfurled behind him as he flew to the sky above the Blood Oxypetalum. He aimed the blood in the bottle at the Blood Oxypetalum and poured it down.</p>
<p>There was only a drop of blood in the palm-sized metal alloy bottle. The drop of crystalline blood landed on the Blood Oxypetalum and quickly seeped in. Instantly, the blood-red color of the Blood Oxypetalum completely faded. The petals turned back to snow-white and it began to bloom.</p>
<p>The Blood Oxypetalum had already become as pure as a snow lotus without any tinge of blood. And within its petals, a sanguine light shot up into the sky carrying with it a rich sanguine aura.</p>
<p>Why is this different from the Mountain God’s blood sacrifice? Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised when he saw this.</p>
<p>“Success.” Cai Jin, Qiao Siyuan, and Liz were overjoyed.</p>
<p>Cai Jin flapped his wings and flew towards the Blood Oxypetalum. He wanted to snatch the seed produced by it.</p>
<p>Thorny flower vines shot out of the water and swept towards Cai Jin in the air. Cai Jin was truly capable, living up to his reputation as one of the four Censors.</p>
<p>His body circled around like an eagle as a sword of light flashed in his hand, severing the flower vines one by one.</p>
<p>What sword is that? Zhou Wen sized up the sword in Cai Jin’s hand curiously.</p>
<p>The sword didn’t have a corporeal blade—it was completely condensed from light. It looked a little like the legendary lightsaber, but a lightsaber would have a device that beamed out the laser. However, the sword was completely condensed from light without any equipment.</p>
<p>The flower vines had been sliced off, and Cai Jin successfully approached the petals. The Blood Oxypetalum was no longer able to resist, and Cai Jin was on the cusp of success.</p>
<p>Just as Cai Jin was about to remove the seed from the Blood Oxypetalum, the lake beside him suddenly exploded. A blurry figure tore out of the water and reached out into the Blood Oxypetalum ahead of him, snatching away the ruby-like seed.</p>
<p>Cai Jin, Qiao Siyuan, and the other’s expressions changed drastically. Cai Jin roared angrily as the blade beam in his hand transformed into a shooting star that he thrust at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wore the Jade Crystal Spirit Armor and held the Golden Battle God Halberd in his hand as he faced the sword of light.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The sword of light was shattered by the Golden Battle God Halberd. The Golden Battle God Halberd’s Golden Divine Light tore through the void and stabbed Cai Jin in the chest.</p>
<h3 id='chapter658'>Chapter 658: Different Seeds</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Mythical weapon!” Cai Jin was alarmed as he summoned a Companion Beast to shield himself. At the same time, he quickly retreated.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he was still too slow. The Golden Battle God Halberd pierced through the Companion Beast’s body and continually slammed into Cai Jin’s chest, piercing through it and impaling in the air.</p>
<p>“Who are you? Why are you antagonizing the Special Inspector Bureau?” Cai Jin glared at Zhou Wen as he coughed out blood.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t answer. With a flick of the Golden Battle God Halberd, Cai Jin’s body was instantly torn apart like a rag. He died and fell into the lake.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Liz turned pale with fright. She was dumbfounded. Cai Jin, one of the four Censors, had been killed in one strike. He didn’t even have the ability to resist, making her feel immense horror.</p>
<p>“Minister…” Liz turned her head and realized that Qiao Siyuan had disappeared. She had no idea when he had escaped.</p>
<p>Liz was instantly alarmed as she turned and ran.</p>
<p>The other inspectors also reacted. Seeing that Qiao Siyuan had run out of sight, they scrambled to escape.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t chase after the inspectors. He didn’t like killing, but this wasn’t why he didn’t chase after them.</p>
<p>The Special Inspector Bureau was a department. Even if he killed the inspectors, they could still recruit new inspectors. Killing them was meaningless.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body moved and instantly appeared in front of Liz, blocking her path. The Golden Battle God Halberd pointed at her chest as the Golden Divine Light flickered, illuminating her pale face.</p>
<p>“I’m Liz from the Cape family. Let me go. You can receive anything you want,” Liz said in horror, not daring to move.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Liz and said indifferently, “Your red convertible sports car isn’t bad. It can still be driven, even after such a heavy collision.”</p>
<p>Liz’s pupils immediately constricted when she heard that. She looked at Zhou Wen in disbelief and shouted, “You are…”</p>
<p>Before she could finish her sentence, the Golden Battle God Halberd had pierced through her chest, causing blood to gush out of her mouth. She couldn’t finish her sentence.</p>
<p>Liz glared at Zhou Wen as though she couldn’t believe that she was about to die.</p>
<p>“Rest in peace. I’ll get the Cape family to accompany you soon.” Zhou Wen raised the Golden Battle God Halberd in his hand and Liz’s body was ripped apart.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to search his surroundings, but he didn’t find Qiao Siyuan. He did not know how he had escaped.</p>
<p>Knowing that he couldn’t stay here any longer, Zhou Wen ignored the ordinary inspectors and quickly left the Funiu Mountain Range.</p>
<p>After taking a detour out of Funiu Mountain Range, Zhou Wen secretly returned to campus.</p>
<p>After returning to his dorm, he realized that the chick and antelope were eyeing him covetously. Zhou Wen hurriedly took out the items he had prepared and handed them over. “I brought you something good. Take a look and see if you like it. It’s a desert specialty…”</p>
<p>After placating the two of them, Zhou Wen returned to his room and took out the two ruby-like Blood Oxypetalum seeds to compare them.</p>
<p>The two seeds looked about the same, but their sizes were different. The one he had just obtained was slightly bigger, and the color was deeper.</p>
<p>The color of the first one was relatively light, making it crystal clear.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy’s eyes lit up when she saw the two seeds. She flew to Zhou Wen’s side and looked at him pitifully.</p>
<p>“You want this?” Zhou Wen moved one of the seeds in his hand in front of Banana Fairy.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy shook her head and pointed at the Blood Oxypetalum seed in Zhou Wen’s other hand.</p>
<p>“Aren’t these two seeds the same?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. The one Banana Fairy wanted was from Mountain God’s blood sacrifice.</p>
<p>After handing the seed to Banana Fairy, Banana Fairy immediately hugged it happily.</p>
<p>After she hugged the seed, the Blood Oxypetalum seed turned into red beams of light that surged towards Banana Fairy’s body. Soon, it completely enveloped Banana Fairy and formed a red cocoon.</p>
<p>Is this an evolution? Zhou Wen was delighted. After Banana Fairy’s evolution, she would advance to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had a lot of feelings for Banana Fairy who had been following him for a long time. To be able to advance to the Mythical stage, no matter how much her combat strength improved, was a good thing for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>It’s the same Blood Oxypetalum seed. Why does Banana Fairy only want the one that Mountain God obtained from its sacrifice and not the other? Zhou Wen looked at the remaining Blood Oxypetalum seed in his hand and couldn’t guess the reason.</p>
<p>He summoned the other Companion Beasts that hadn’t evolved to see if they were interested in the Blood Oxypetalum seed. However, Demonic Neonate and Doctor Darkness weren’t interested in the Blood Oxypetalum seed either.</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness didn’t have an Evolvable attribute, but Zhou Wen felt that Doctor Darkness was very useful. He had always wanted him to evolve, but he couldn’t find a way.</p>
<p>Instead, it was an Explosive Fiend Man. He was very interested in the Blood Oxypetalum seed and was eager to try it out.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“It’s your lucky day.” Zhou Wen threw the remaining Blood Oxypetalum seed at the Explosive Fiend Man.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, the Explosive Fiend Man swallowed the Blood Oxypetalum seed. Not long after, his body underwent a strange change. It looked like he was about to begin evolving.</p>
<p>Explosive Fiend Man’s level was too low. Typically, it should be able to complete its evolution very quickly, but who knew that the Explosive Fiend Man had actually transformed into a Companion Egg? It looked like it would take some time before it completed its evolution.</p>
<p>Is it a problem with Explosive Fiend Man, or is there something wrong with the Blood Oxypetalum seed that the bureau produced? Zhou Wen was momentarily unsure as he could only store Explosive Fiend Man and Banana Fairy into the chaos space.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“The Blood Oxypetalum seed was snatched away. Cai Jin died in battle, and Liz’s fate is unknown? Qiao Siyuan, you still have the audacity to return?” Shen Yuchi looked at Qiao Siyuan with a sullen expression. He was livid.</p>
<p>The Special Inspector Bureau’s present situation wasn’t good to begin with. He had spent immense effort to obtain the blood essence of dimensional creatures, especially that one drop of divine blood. It was impossible for him to obtain a second drop. Not only was it gone, but Cai Jin and Liz’s lives were also lost.</p>
<p>Cai Jin’s death was fine, but Liz was a member of the Cape family. It would be troublesome to explain this matter to them.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Director-General, I deserve death. However, if I didn’t bring back the enemy’s information, my death would be of zero value,” Qiao Siyuan said as he played a video. It was the video of Zhou Wen snatching the Blood Oxypetalum and killing Cai Jin.</p>
<p>“A Mythical weapon? It looks like something from the West District,” Shen Yuchi said as he looked at the Golden Battle God Halberd in Zhou Wen’s hand.</p>
<p>“I’ve already investigated it. This is the Mythical creature, Golden Battle God Halberd of the Metalwork Temple in the Peninsula of Gods. The members of the Family Clan of Gods had previously killed the Golden Battle God Halberd,” Qiao Siyuan said.</p>
<h3 id='chapter659'>Chapter 659: Fiend Man Evolution</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Are you telling me that this person comes from the Family Clan of Gods?” Shen Yuchi frowned.</p>
<p>“That’s not what I meant. Based on the information we currently have, the Family Clan of Gods has the highest chance of possessing the Golden Battle God Halberd,” Qiao Siyuan said.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi looked at Qiao Siyuan for a while before saying meaningfully, “Your intelligence is timely.”</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan’s expression didn’t change as he said, “It’s my job. Director-General, you handed such an important mission to me, but I screwed it up. I deserve death. Please mete out your punishment.”</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi looked at Qiao Siyuan and said with a smile, “Then go to the Cape family and explain this matter clearly.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I screwed up. I will definitely explain it to Senator Cape. It has nothing to do with our Special Inspector Bureau.” After bowing, Qiao Siyuan left Shen Yuchi’s office.</p>
<p>After Qiao Siyuan left, a person walked out of an inner room.</p>
<p>It was a woman in a suit and she looked very capable. However, she was wearing a hat that was pulled very low. With large sunglasses covering half of her face, it was almost impossible to tell her looks. However, her full, fair chin and red lips left a deep impression.</p>
<p>“Button, what do you think of this person?” Shen Yuchi asked the woman.</p>
<p>The woman called Button said calmly, “Do you mean the person in the video or Minister Qiao?”</p>
<p>“Both.” Shen Yuchi tapped his fingers rhythmically on the table as though he was thinking about something.</p>
<p>“The person in the video wears an unknown type of armor. The weapon is just as Minister Qiao said; it’s the Golden Battle God Halberd. The Metalwork Temple is a reserved area of the Family Clan of Gods. Their family does have a Golden Battle God Halberd, but that doesn’t mean anything. As for Minister Qiao, he’s very smart. He gave himself a chance to live and has given the Cape family an excuse. The Cape family probably won’t make things difficult for him when he goes to them,” said Button.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi nodded. “Among the many ministers, Qiao Siyuan is the most capable. Furthermore, he keeps a low profile and doesn’t fight for fame or fortune. At the same time, he doesn’t even have many hobbies.”</p>
<p>“Do you think there’s something wrong with him?” Button asked.</p>
<p>“The operation this time was highly confidential. Very few people knew about it. Only Cai Jin, Qiao Siyuan, and Liz knew the details. Cai Jin was an extremely careful person. Under such circumstances, he was actually ambushed and had the Blood Oxypetalum seed snatched from him. There’s a high chance that there’s a traitor in our midst,” Shen Yuchi said after some thought.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to investigate?” Button asked.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to worry about that. Help me make a trip to the Family Clan of Gods and send a copy of the video to them,” Shen Yuchi said.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen grinded dungeons in his dorm the entire time, but strangely, he obtained plenty of the six skills such as the Room Solar Rabbit, but he failed to obtain a single Neck Gold Dragon.</p>
<p>With one of the Azure Dragon seven palaces missing, the other six were useless.</p>
<p>In the boundless Endless Sea of Stars, he also failed to find the Astral Combat Beasts. This dungeon was just too huge. Zhou Wen guessed that it would take him a month or two to clear it.</p>
<p>However, he could do nothing else if he continued grinding like this. It would take up all his time. Most of the dimensional creatures in the Endless Sea of Stars were useless. This left Zhou Wen vexed.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. There are actually twenty-eight Lunar Mansions in the Endless Sea of Stars. Then, is the distribution of the planets here related to the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions? Zhou Wen decided to check.</p>
<p>The twenty-eight Lunar Mansions was the ancient way of dividing the cosmos. They divided the area around the celestial sphere’s ecliptic plane and celestial equator into twenty-eight regions.</p>
<p>If the Endless Sea of Stars was really arranged in such a pattern, one could determine the location of the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s understanding of such knowledge was very limited. He only knew the name, but he knew nothing about the distribution.</p>
<p>He went online to search for some information, but there were many contradictory points on the Internet. Furthermore, they explained things unclearly. After reading for a long time, Zhou Wen roughly figured out the approximate distribution and locations of the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions.</p>
<p>After comparing it with the Endless Sea of Stars dungeon, he realized that some of the star charts in the Endless Sea were indeed similar to the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions. And the place where he had obtained the skills like the Room Solar Rabbit and Heart Lunar Fox was none other than the region of the Azure Dragon’s seven palaces.</p>
<p>This region was extremely huge. After grinding for so long, Zhou Wen still failed to leave the range of the Azure Dragon’s seven palaces.</p>
<p>It’s indeed so. It’s no wonder I only managed to obtain the Azure Dragon’s seven palaces’ skills. Zhou Wen roughly analyzed the situation and rushed to the stellar domain where the Neck Gold Dragon was. He planned on farming the Neck Gold Dragon to see what use those skills had.</p>
<p>However, the Neck Gold Dragon didn’t appear that easily. He swept the entire area but saw nothing of the Neck Gold Dragon.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me this is as difficult to farm as Poison Dragon Palm 3! He felt that things weren’t looking good. He had six but was still lacking one. If it was really that difficult to farm for it, he didn’t know when he would be able to have it drop.</p>
<p>How can I find Liu Yun? I have to ask which small planet the so-called Astral Combat Beast is on. Zhou Wen was extremely vexed. His knowledge of Liu Yun was very limited. He didn’t have his phone number or address, so he didn’t know how to find him.</p>
<p>After grinding for a few days, Zhou Wen was on the brink of giving up. It was indeed difficult to farm for Neck Gold Dragons.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The evolving Explosive Fiend Man finally broke out of its shell. The evolved Explosive Fiend Man was still like a Tesla Trooper. It wore heavy armor, and even the pipes were black. There was also a crystal cylinder on its back. One could see something red inside, making it look very strange.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the Explosive Fiend Man’s stats.</p>
<p>Explosive Fiend Man: Legendary (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Unlawful</p>
<p>Strength: 21</p>
<p>Speed: 21</p>
<p>Constitution: 21</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 21</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Death List, Time-Blast</p>
<p>Companion Form: Self-detonation Device</p>
<p>His stats didn’t change much just as Zhou Wen had expected. Zhou Wen focused on studying the Explosive Fiend Man’s Life Providence.</p>
<p>Unlawful: Unrestricted by laws for a period of time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be alarmed. This Life Providence wasn’t restricted by rules or laws. This annotation implied that he was rather powerful, but Zhou Wen didn’t know what the actual effects were.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could experiment with the Explosive Fiend Man’s Life Providence, the Explosive Fiend Man began evolving again, turning into an egg once more.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the power of the Blood Oxypetalum seed is a little too potent. It actually allowed Explosive Fiend Man to continuously evolve. I wonder where the bureau’s blood came from. Zhou Wen also wanted to get one himself when he saw how effective the Blood Oxypetalum seed was.</p>
<p>Just as he was thinking, his phone suddenly rang. It was Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, quickly go online and watch the battle. A Companion Beast is challenging Primordial Sword Immortal. It’s the Xia family’s Companion Beast,” Li Xuan said excitedly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter660'>Chapter 660: Count of the Wind</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Has the Xia family finally taken action? Zhou Wen hurriedly unlocked his phone and randomly found a video website. He found the live broadcast.</p>
<p>The scene was of the cube’s screen where a white-haired man in black levitated above the cube’s arena.</p>
<p>However, the man’s lower body was a snake. The black clothes on his body flapped amidst zero wind. Even his long white hair slowly fluttered in the air.</p>
<p>Count of the Wind… Zhou Wen was immediately shocked when he saw the humanoid Companion Beast’s name.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Count of the Wind and the Lord of the Rain were famous existences who had participated in the Zhuolu battle. He never expected the Xia family to have a terrifying Companion Beast like Count of the Wind.</p>
<p>That’s not right. I didn’t find Count of the Wind and the Lord of the Rain in Zhuolu. Where did the Xia family’s Count of the Wind come from? Zhou Wen frowned in thought.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, Count of the Wind should be in Zhuolu, but it wasn’t to be found. Furthermore, the Xia family’s possession of Count of the Wind made Zhou Wen feel that something was amiss.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, I’m here. Quickly open the door,” Li Xuan shouted from outside.</p>
<p>“Why are you here now?” Zhou Wen opened the door and saw Li Xuan holding his phone, watching the live stream as well.</p>
<p>“It’s boring to watch such a battle alone. Did you see Count of the Wind? Although I don’t know his combat strength, his looks way too cool. As expected of a famous existence in the mythical battle,” Li Xuan said as he looked inside. Seeing the antelope sleeping on the sofa, he carefully walked in and pulled a chair to sit down.</p>
<p>“It’s definitely not as simple as a probe if the Xia family is taking action.” Just as Zhou Wen was speaking, he suddenly saw a flash on the combat platform. Primordial Sword Immortal had already charged over and accepted the challenge.</p>
<p>Primordial Sword Immortal was straightforward. After appearing, the ruby on its hilt emitted sword beams that transformed into a rain of swords that charged at Count of the Wind.</p>
<p>Count of the Wind floated in the air as a formless wind thrust his body. He fanned the sword rain with the peacock feathered fan in his hand.</p>
<p>The formless wind immediately reversed the sword rain’s direction and collided with the sword beams behind it. Immediately, an explosion sounded as the sky was filled with sword flashes.</p>
<p>A sword hum resounded through the void as Primordial Sword Immortal automatically unsheathed its scabbard and slashed at Count of the Wind with terrifying speed.</p>
<p>Count of the Wind’s body drifted as though he was being carried by the wind. He easily dodged Primordial Sword Immortal’s attack.</p>
<p>However, Primordial Sword Immortal refused to give up. It slashed at Count of the Wind again and again as sword beams crisscrossed, as though they were about to tear the world apart.</p>
<p>The Golden Overlord Sword and Primordial Sword Immortal were considered similar Companion Beasts, but the Golden Overlord Sword was much weaker in comparison.</p>
<p>Primordial Sword Immortal wasn’t just slashing. Its every move was a profound sword technique.</p>
<p>It was a real sword technique, not an Essence Energy Skill. Zhou Wen could even sense the astonishing sword intent. Just the sword intent alone made Zhou Wen sigh at his inferiority.</p>
<p>Even his Transcendent Flying Immortal was inferior to that sword’s realm.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, how can this be? A sword actually has such a terrifying sword technique and sword intent. Who can beat it?” Li Xuan also noticed the uniqueness of the situation as he exclaimed in surprise.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded with a heavy expression. Although Li Xuan appeared as carefree as usual, Zhou Wen could sense that he cared a lot about Count of the Wind.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also understood why Li Xuan cared so much about it. Li Mobai had once said that the reason their talented eldest brother died so early was because of the Xia family.</p>
<p>Li Xuan treated the Xia family as a conjectured enemy, which was why he was so concerned.</p>
<p>Count of the Wind rode the wind and floated amidst the shocking barrage of sword techniques. The terrifying Primordial Sword Immortal was unable to injure him at all.</p>
<p>From beginning to end, Count of the Wind only dodged and didn’t counterattack. He seemed to be observing the strength of Primordial Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>What a powerful movement technique… Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up when he saw Count of the Wind’s movement technique.</p>
<p>Count of the Wind’s movement technique was different from his Transcendent Flying Immortal despite all of them being called movement techniques.</p>
<p>Count of the Wind’s movement techniques were extremely elegant. No matter how fast Primordial Sword Immortal’s sword techniques were, they were unable to even touch his clothes.</p>
<p>Count of the Wind looked like a god of the wind. The sword winds brought by Primordial Sword Immortal made his body drift about with the sword wind. Therefore, no matter how fast Primordial Sword Immortal was, it couldn’t touch him. Count of the Wind was simply riding the wind.</p>
<p>I wonder if Banana Fairy will be as strong as Count of the Wind when she evolves to the Mythical stage. Zhou Wen was somewhat looking forward to evolving Banana Fairy who was of the same type.</p>
<p>After failing to hit Count of the Wind, Primordial Sword Immortal suddenly stopped attacking and flew back into its scabbard.</p>
<p>Ever since the stone sword was unsheathed, the scabbard had been floating there without any movement. At this moment, the scabbard spewed out immortal beams.</p>
<p>Soon, the immortal glow condensed into a humanoid immortal figure. The immortal figure held the scabbard in one hand and the stone sword in the other. It looked at Count of the Wind from afar.</p>
<p>So this is the true face of Primordial Sword Immortal. The previous battles weren’t enough to force out his true body. Zhou Wen stared at Primordial Sword Immortal. Although he could only see an immortal silhouette that resembled a sword spirit, the powerful sword intent on him was enough to shock anyone.</p>
<p>Just by standing in midair with the sword in hand, he gave off an aura of supremacy. It was as if he could slice apart the entire world with just one strike.</p>
<p>What domineering sword intent… Zhou Wen stared at Primordial Sword Immortal. Such domineering sword intent was very similar to Transcendent Flying Immortal’s domineering aspect.</p>
<p>However, it was even more domineering than Transcendent Flying Immortal. It was also more natural and had a higher realm.</p>
<p>On the other side, Count of the Wind remained calm and composed. He seemed to be walking leisurely as though he didn’t care about the terror that Primordial Sword Immortal was unleashing.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen could sense that Count of the Wind wasn’t underestimating Primordial Sword Immortal. It was just that his realm was as such—a complete disregard of everything in the world.</p>
<p>Even if all the deities in the world were his enemies, he could still remain ever so calm even on the brink of death.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Primordial Sword Immortal before looking at Count of the Wind. He seemed to have figured something out, that he felt two eyes were insufficient.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Primordial Sword Immortal moved. The sword moved like a ray of light, as though it had sliced through half the sky. It was so fast that one could only see the sword’s glow and not see his movements.</p>
<p>Count of the Wind also moved. He transformed into a gust of wind that could no longer be seen with the naked eye. He rushed to face off with Primordial Sword Immortal’s sword glow.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A cool breeze met the sword glow as a terrifying shockwave rose up.</p>
<p>The fan and sword constantly clashed, but most people only saw light blasts. They couldn’t see the two Companion Beasts, much less their techniques.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t even keep up despite his eyesight. All he could do was switch to the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra and use the Eight Perfections Wisdom and Hell King Life Soul to strengthen his vision. Even then he could barely make out what was happening.</p>
<h3 id='chapter661'>Chapter 661: Evenly Matched</h3>
<p>Li Xuan couldn’t see the trajectory of the battle either. All he could do was summon his Life Soul. His body was immediately covered by the carapace, and his eyes had an eye mask similar to that of a certain insect.</p>
<p>With the augmentation of the Life Soul, the battle scene Li Xuan saw slowed down significantly.</p>
<p>“Amazing. One doesn’t need to be afraid of potent strength or ruthless skill, but one needs to be afraid of such a highly-intelligent Companion Beast. For a Companion Beast to have such high intelligence, it’s impossible for a Mythical Companion Beast of the same level to win against them. It’s similar to a bug-like existence in games,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Intelligence is indeed a hidden attribute of a Companion Beast. A Companion Beast with high intelligence is indeed at an advantage in battle.” Zhou Wen nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>He also liked to use highly-intelligent Companion Beasts like Banana Fairy, Demonic Neonate, and Doctor Darkness. Even if Zhou Wen didn’t give them orders, they knew when and what to do.</p>
<p>Sometimes, their decisions exceeded Zhou Wen’s expectations.</p>
<p>As for the brainless representatives, like Tyrant Behemoth, Six-Winged, and Golden Battle God Halberd, they relied on their instincts to fight. Their intelligence was much lower.</p>
<p>It couldn’t be said that this was bad. If one’s strength was strong enough, such combat instinct could push their strength to the limit and erupt with 120% of their combat strength.</p>
<p>However, if one were to encounter an evenly matched opponent, such brainless Companion Beasts would be at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s mind wasn’t on these Companion Beasts. He was even more interested in Primordial Sword Immortal’s sword techniques and Count of the Wind’s movement techniques. He was completely immersed in them as he sensed the two completely different approaches.</p>
<p>One was about claiming supremacy, while the other was about being calm and composed. The two were extremes.</p>
<p>And these two extremes were similar to the one Zhou Wen had when he first understood the divine Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>Count of the Wind and Primordial Sword Immortal were evenly matched. Neither of them had the upper hand, but up to now, they had yet to use their Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>Ordinary citizens were fidgeting in anxiety because they could only see the glow. They couldn’t see the details of the battle. Only a few Epic experts with visual abilities could see the battle clearly.</p>
<p>Thankfully, modern filming equipment was already very advanced. There would be slow-motion replays in the future. Coupled with the commentary, most people would be able to understand it clearly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was engrossed in watching when Count of the Wind suddenly retreated from the battle. Without any warning, he admitted defeat and left the battlefield.</p>
<p>“Why did he admit defeat? The victory clearly wasn’t decided yet,” Li Xuan said in a daze.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen had been taking in their sword techniques and movement techniques, he had a deeper understanding of them than Li Xuan. He shook his head and said, “Count of the Wind and Primordial Sword Immortal are very close in every aspect. If they continue fighting, they can only use their Wheels of Destiny. The Xia family clearly doesn’t want to go all out yet. It’s just a probe, so they have chosen to give up.”</p>
<p>“What a pity. Such a divine-level battle is much more interesting than watching those Strength-type Companion Beasts fight,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also felt that he hadn’t had enough. He got up and said, “Let’s go to the training grounds. I gained some insight from watching their battle. I liked to experiment to see if I’m right or wrong.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, Li Xuan agreed immediately. The two of them went to the training grounds and found an independent training room.</p>
<p>“I will try to imitate Primordial Sword Immortal’s sword techniques. Help me check to see if it’s correct.” Zhou Wen picked up a practice sword and recalled Primordial Sword Immortal’s sword intent as he slashed at Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Interesting, but it’s not domineering enough. You still have some reservations about this strike. You should be more resolute.” Li Xuan didn’t take out his weapon as he used his carapace to block the practice sword.</p>
<p>“Is this enough?” Zhou Wen slashed out again. At the same time, he tried his best to fuse his emotions into the Primordial Sword Immortal’s sword intent realm.</p>
<p>“Not enough… Not enough… It’s still not enough…” Li Xuan constantly fought Zhou Wen. As Zhou Wen’s sword techniques became faster and faster, he no longer had the time to say that it was inadequate. Every time Zhou Wen attacked, Li Xuan would only say no.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gradually became one with the will, as his intent fused with the sword. The feeling of using the sword grew stronger and stronger. He gradually realized that the dominance of Primordial Sword Immortal wasn’t because his sword techniques were fast and ruthless, but because it attacked the key spots. It prevented the opponent from counterattacking, so there was no need for defense.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s practice sword slashed at Li Xuan. Although he had only used a practice sword, he had actually left a sword mark on Li Xuan’s carapace because the sword beam was too powerful.</p>
<p>“Interesting. Again.” Li Xuan was very excited.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also feeling excited as he brandished his sword without any hesitation to slash at Li Xuan. The more he fought, the more he reveled in the feeling of this sword technique.</p>
<p>Defense? What the hell was that? I’ll slash out with my sword. Those who follow me will live, those who oppose me will die. There was no need for defense. With one sword in hand, I’m the best in the world.</p>
<p>The more Zhou Wen fought, the more arrogant he became. He wasn’t usually an arrogant person, but under the influence of the sword intent, his attacks became more and more violent.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>Li Xuan wasn’t able to completely block Zhou Wen’s sword technique. Sword marks appeared over his carapace, but the armor was immediately restored to its original state upon cracking. Its self-healing speed was unbelievably fast.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen slashed at Li Xuan again. The practice sword made of special rubber couldn’t withstand the domineering sword beam and shattered.</p>
<p>“My turn.” Li Xuan leaped up and drew a practice sword from the weapon rack. He slashed at Zhou Wen, using an identical sword technique that Zhou Wen had just used.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed. He knew that Li Xuan’s Life Soul could sense the enemy’s techniques and gain experience from suffering injuries, but he never expected that he could learn the techniques that humans used.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s strike wasn’t much worse than the one he had used.</p>
<p>However, this made Zhou Wen even more excited. “Don’t worry about me. Use all your strength.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have a carapace protecting him. Although Li Xuan’s sword technique was right, it didn’t have that domineering aura. That was why Zhou Wen felt confident.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Li Xuan didn’t hold back any further. He used all the experience he had just absorbed from his injuries in battle. A domineering sword beam immediately filled the sword.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen recalled Count of the Wind’s movement technique and concept and began mimicking his movement technique to circle around Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Movement techniques were Zhou Wen’s forte. They were easier to use than sword techniques, so he got into the groove faster than with the sword technique.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Gulli and Sadie had just finished watching the battle between Count of the Wind and Primordial Sword Immortal. Sadie’s Eye of Odin had seen more things. She wanted to study the battle between Count of the Wind and Primordial Sword Immortal with Gulli, so they had come to the training grounds.</p>
<p>They also wanted to find a private training room, but they realized that there were already people inside. Just as they were feeling depressed, they suddenly heard the whistling sound of sword aura coming from the training room beside them.</p>
<h3 id='chapter662'>Chapter 662: The Talented Xuanwen Club</h3>
<p>“This sword aura sound…” Sadie was alarmed when she heard the sound of the sword aura. She turned around and walked to the door of the training room. She tried pushing the door, only to realize that it was locked.</p>
<p>However, through the crack in the door, she could see the situation inside.</p>
<p>Sadie approached the door crack and looked inside. She was immediately alarmed.</p>
<p>“Sis, what are you doing? This isn’t good, right?” Gulli looked at Sadie strangely.</p>
<p>“Come and take a look.” Sadie pulled Gulli over and got him to stand in front of the door crack. He looked inside and saw two people sparring.</p>
<p>“Why does this sword technique look so familiar…” Gulli muttered when he saw Li Xuan’s sword technique.</p>
<p>“What’s with that brain of yours? That sword technique is the sword technique of Primordial Sword Immortal. And the movement technique Zhou Wen uses is Count of the Wind’s movement technique. Have you forgotten them after just watching them?” Sadie said.</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s true. That’s the Primordial Sword Immortal’s sword technique. But how could that person use Primordial Sword Immortal’s sword technique? Could he be the owner of Primordial Sword Immortal?” Gulli said in surprise.</p>
<p>“My dear brother, you are really hopelessly stupid. Zhou Wen is using Count of the Wind’s movement technique. Does that make him Count of the Wind’s master?” Sadie said helplessly.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Isn’t Count of the Wind from the Xia family? How did he become Zhou Wen’s?” Gulli was puzzled.</p>
<p>Sadie was immediately rendered speechless. All she could do was say to Gulli, “Zhou Wen isn’t Count of the Wind’s master. The other person isn’t the owner of Primordial Sword Immortal either. They are the same as us. They watched the battle between Primordial Sword Immortal and Count of the Wind and learned Primordial Sword Immortal’s sword technique and Count of the Wind’s movement technique.”</p>
<p>“They learned the sword technique and movement technique from simply watching the battle? How is this possible? Even you have to do plenty of analysis and simulation to learn a portion of it despite having the Eye of Odin. How long has it been? Yet, they have already learned the sword technique and movement technique. Isn’t this too unbelievable?” Gulli widened his eyes in disbelief.</p>
<p>“It’s indeed hard to believe, but they’ve done it.” Sadie looked at Zhou Wen and Li Xuan with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>Before coming to Sunset College, she was confident that she could defeat Zhou Wen and avenge Lance.</p>
<p>However, after coming here, Sadie realized that she was far from Zhou Wen’s match. Not only was she no match for him, but she couldn’t even defeat Feng Qiuyan, who claimed to be learning from him.</p>
<p>The person who was fighting Zhou Wen inside was similarly no weaker than her, and the person was clearly not Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>How many terrifying geniuses are there hidden in Sunset College? Sadie’s expression was extremely complicated. The more she watched the battle, the more terrified she felt.</p>
<p>Although Li Xuan’s sword technique and Zhou Wen’s movement technique weren’t at the level of Primordial Sword Immortal and Count of the Wind, they already possessed the charm of the two. They had truly understood the meaning behind the sword technique and movement technique. It wasn’t just a simple imitation.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The practice sword in Li Xuan’s hand failed to withstand the powerful explosion of the sword aura. The two of them could only stop.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, are you going to continue training?” Li Xuan retracted his Life Soul and revealed his true body.</p>
<p>Gulli and Sadie widened their eyes. They never expected that the person who used such a sword technique was actually the frivolous-looking, foppish Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Forget it. It’s pointless. I’m not continuing,” Zhou Wen said as he shook his head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already understood the profundity of the movement technique and sword technique. However, just imitating them was useless. He needed to fuse the movement technique and sword technique into his system. This wasn’t something that could be done in a short period of time. He needed time to think.</p>
<p>Sadie and Gulli clearly misunderstood Zhou Wen’s intentions. They believed that Zhou Wen was saying that this sword technique and movement technique were too simple that they were boring him.</p>
<p>If anyone else had said that, Sadie and Gulli would think that they were arrogant and ignorant.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had only just watched the battle between Count of the Wind and Primordial Sword Immortal. Yet, in such a short period of time, he had already comprehended the charm of Count of the Wind’s movement technique. Such a genius could say anything without going overboard.</p>
<p>Seeing that the two of them were about to come out, Sadie and Gulli hurriedly hid to the side. After the two of them walked out of the training grounds, Sadie said, “Sunset College is really filled with all kinds of hidden talent, especially the Xuanwen Club. I never expected that the usually frivolous Li Xuan would have such strength and talent. In the past, when we were in the North District, we were like frogs in a well, looking down on young people who weren’t from the six families. However, Zhou Wen, Feng Qiuyan, and Li Xuan aren’t any worse than the top geniuses of the six families. I wonder how many geniuses there are in Sunset College.”</p>
<p>“They’re really too strong. We made no mistake coming. With such opponents, I think we can improve faster,” Gulli said excitedly.</p>
<p>Sadie nodded with a heavy expression. In the past, the Federation’s geniuses came from the six families. However, with the development of the times, more and more geniuses emerged from the ordinary families. The influence of the six families was gradually declining.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After this battle, all the major media outlets gave a slow-motion video of the battle. Furthermore, there were explanations and professional analyses. It left everyone watching with relish.</p>
<p>The popularity of Tyrant Behemoth and Orochi’s battle was completely overshadowed.</p>
<p>Although Tyrant Behemoth was strong, its intelligence was lacking. Its battle with Orochi was too simple and crude. It was far inferior to the battle between Primordial Sword Immortal and Count of the Wind.</p>
<p>People were discussing who would have been stronger if they had fought to the end—Count of the Wind or Primordial Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>Some people supported Uncle Feng, but more people believed that Primordial Sword Immortal was the strongest. Otherwise, why would Count of the Wind admit defeat?</p>
<p>The other families understood the Xia family’s intent. The Xia family had already probed the strength of Primordial Sword Immortal. They probably wouldn’t make a move for the time being. It was up to them now.</p>
<p>Including the overseas demons and the six families, the various factions were analyzing the abilities of Primordial Sword Immortal and Count of the Wind. They were already eager to try.</p>
<p>Now, other than not knowing what Primordial Sword Immortal’s Wheel of Destiny was, Primordial Sword Immortal’s abilities were mostly analyzed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, based on all sorts of evidence, its Wheel of Destiny was very likely an offensive miracle.</p>
<p>On this basis, the various families came up with a strategy to deal with the situation. It was only a matter of time before they challenged Primordial Sword Immortal’s number one spot.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t idle either. When he returned, he informed An Sheng of his encounter with Chu He in Netherworld City and got him to help investigate Chu He and his family.</p>
<p>An Sheng placed a lot of importance on this matter and personally went to Chu He’s hometown. Now, An Sheng had finally sent the news back.</p>
<p>According to An Sheng’s investigations, Chu He’s wife and daughter had always believed that Chu He had gone to Zhuolu. They had no idea that Chu He had gone to the desert.</p>
<p>Furthermore, ever since Chu He had left home and gone to Zhuolu, he had never contacted them again. He hadn’t communicated with them, nor had he written any letters.</p>
<p>After various investigations, An Sheng came to the conclusion that Chu He had gone to Zhuolu and had never been to the desert.</p>
<h3 id='chapter663'>Chapter 663: Metal Walnut Gets Gnawed Through</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Are you saying that the Chu He I met in Netherworld City is a fake?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.</p>
<p>“No, it’s the opposite. I think the Chu He who went to Zhuolu is a fake,” An Sheng said with certainty. “From the information I obtained, everything about the Chu He that went to Zhuolu is perfect. However, this ends up making me feel that something is amiss.”</p>
<p>After a pause, An Sheng continued, “According to my investigations, Professor Chu He studied the Taklamakan desert in the past. In the beginning, he indeed rejected the invitation from the expedition team, but for some reason, he later agreed. He then went to Zhuolu. However, during his time in Zhuolu, he never contacted his family. This makes me find it a little abnormal.”</p>
<p>“In other words, someone really did some tampering?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“We can’t be sure yet. If someone really is behind this, their force is definitely extraordinary. The other party has done it so cleanly that we can’t find any problems. If you hadn’t encountered Chu He, who had already died, in Netherworld City, I’m afraid no one would have expected that Chu He, who went to Zhuolu, would be a fake,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“How’s Chu He’s wife and daughter?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Their situation will become very dangerous after our investigations. To ensure their safety, I’ve already brought them back,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>From An Sheng’s tone, Zhou Wen knew that An Sheng had definitely used some extreme means.</p>
<p>“If it’s possible, take good care of them. As long as it’s not an unreasonable request, try your best to satisfy them. I’ll be in charge of all expenses,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. They have already been brought into the manor by Madam. Madam values them very much,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“That’s good.” Zhou Wen knew that Ouyang Lan was as concerned about the former principal as he was. Since Chu He’s wife and daughter had gone to her, Ouyang Lan definitely wouldn’t let anything happen to them.</p>
<p>After ending the call with An Sheng, Zhou Wen was considering what he could do.</p>
<p>I’m far inferior to An Sheng when it comes to investigating such matters. It’s useless even if I go. If someone really is doing something behind our backs, they are definitely a powerful force to do it so seamlessly. Even if we find out the truth, we will need a powerful force to resolve the problem. It’s better for me to raise my strength first. Zhou Wen felt that what he needed to do now was to become stronger.</p>
<p>Ding! Just as he cleared the Metalwork Temple dungeon, another Golden Battle God Halberd dropped.</p>
<p>How easily does this thing drop? It’s already the fourth one. Zhou Wen was somewhat speechless.</p>
<p>However, being able to have another Mythical Companion Beast was also an increase in combat strength. If he really managed to obtain a few hundred Golden Battle God Halberds, he might be able to flatten the six Federation families with just Golden Battle God Halberds.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to continue grinding, his phone rang. He opened it and saw that it was from The Thearch.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“I’ll make a deal with you. Are you interested?”</p>
<p>“What deal?” Zhou Wen replied.</p>
<p>“I can let you obtain a Companion Beast. That Companion Beast can help you defeat Primordial Sword Immortal and Companion Beast, but in exchange, you have to give me the divine fruit after obtaining it.” The Thearch sent another message.</p>
<p>“What benefits do I have if I give you the divine fruit?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it enough for you to obtain a Companion Beast that can help you defeat Primordial Sword Immortal?” The Thearch asked.</p>
<p>“What kind of Companion Beast is that?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Come to Chess Mountain. You will know when you get it,” said The Thearch.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you want me to enter Deer Terrace Pavilion again?” Zhou Wen deliberately sent a message in an unwilling tone.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen did want to enter Deer Terrace Pavilion. In-game, he could only enter the ancient building in Deer Terrace Pavilion, but he couldn’t enter the platform below.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen really wanted to find another way to enter Deer Terrace Pavilion other than the gap in reality.</p>
<p>“How can you obtain benefits without entering Deer Terrace Pavilion?” The Thearch asked.</p>
<p>“It’s too disgusting to enter Deer Terrace Pavilion underwater. Is there no other way of entry?” Zhou Wen wanted to find out other ways to enter Deer Terrace Pavilion so that there was no need for him to trade with The Thearch.</p>
<p>To his surprise, The Thearch was tight-lipped. She only replied, “Don’t worry. I’ll let you enter Deer Terrace Pavilion easily this time.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen asked a few more questions, but The Thearch didn’t say a word. She only said that he would know when the time came.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat hesitant. He naturally wanted a Companion Beast that could defeat Primordial Sword Immortal, but he wasn’t willing to take the risk at Deer Terrace Pavilion in reality.</p>
<p>The Thearch was just too mysterious. Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to have too much contact with her.</p>
<p>Forget it. I won’t go. Even without The Thearch’s Companion Beast, I have a chance of defeating Primordial Sword Immortal. Zhou Wen had carefully studied the battle between Count of the Wind and Primordial Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth still had a chance of defeating Primordial Sword Immortal, but that was under the premise that Primordial Sword Immortal’s Wheel couldn’t kill Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>As he was pondering, he suddenly felt fluctuations in the chaos space.</p>
<p>Could it be that Explosive Fiend Man’s evolution has completed? Zhou Wen hurriedly checked the chaos space.</p>
<p>However, he realized that Explosive Fiend Man hadn’t evolved. It was still in its egg form.</p>
<p>That fluctuation was actually coming from the metal walnut.</p>
<p>The tiny beast had been nibbling at the metal walnut all this time. After so long, it had left a deep bite mark on the metal walnut. From where it was nibbling, it seemed to have been bitten through. A crack as thin as a strand of hair appeared on the surface of the crack, revealing a white color.</p>
<p>As for the fluctuations Zhou Wen felt, they were actually emitted from the metal walnut. The fluctuations seemed to be felt through his consciousness, but Zhou Wen actually felt as though it was asking for his help.</p>
<p>Could it be that there’s a dimensional creature in this metal walnut? Zhou Wen took it out from the chaos space.</p>
<p>The little beast continued to bite at the metal walnut. It looked like it wouldn’t stop until it bit right through.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used his hand to pull it, but its claws gripped the metal walnut tightly, unwilling to let go.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to knock it out. After the beast fainted, its paws continued holding on tightly. Zhou Wen had to let it hold the metal walnut as he reached out to touch the crack that the beast had bitten open.</p>
<p>White matter emerged from the crack. Zhou Wen touched it and immediately felt his Essence Energy flow into the metal walnut. The feeling was similar to incubating a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>The thing inside the metal walnut is actually a Companion Egg? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he allowed the metal walnut to absorb his Essence Energy.</p>
<h3 id='chapter664'>Chapter 664: Dragon Gate Anomaly</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>As the Essence Energy was absorbed, the outer shell of the metal walnut split into two along the crack. A white ball-shaped object rolled out and transformed into a stream of light that shot at Zhou Wen’s body, turning into a white, circular tattoo.</p>
<p>When he summoned the Companion Beast, it was about the size of a football. He held it in his hand and pinched it. It was soft and bouncy, similar to the feeling of a bouncy ball. Maybe even softer.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen casually pinched the Companion Beast into various strange shapes. Once he released his grip, it would return to its original state.</p>
<p>This Companion Beast is rather fun. I wonder what use it has? Zhou Wen didn’t receive any information regarding the Companion Beast, so he felt somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>Typically, after contracting a Companion Beast, one would receive some vague information, such as the name, level, etc.</p>
<p>However, this one didn’t give any of that. Zhou Wen could only take out his phone to read its information. He was still thinking, Such a special Companion Beast must have a very special ability, right? However, it absorbed rather little Essence Energy. Its level shouldn’t be high.</p>
<p>After placing the white Companion Beast in the viewfinder, Zhou Wen clicked on its information and ended up petrified.</p>

<p>Holy sh*t, this darn thing is Tai Sui… Zhou Wen regretted it so much that he felt a kick in his guts. If he had known this would happen, he wouldn’t have asked for trouble. He would have let the little beast eat it.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it’s only at the Mortal stage. It doesn’t seem to have any Life Providence or skills like a Jinxes Master or Misfortune. Zhou Wen carefully looked at the introduction and realized that it wasn’t as bad as he imagined.</p>
<p>However, Tai Sui could actually evolve. This was basically the specialty of a Mythical Companion Beast. If he continued evolving it, it was unknown if it would have abilities like a Jinxes Master or Misfortune.</p>
<p>I read online that Tai Sui has a Life Providence like Misfortune and Bad Luck. However, it seems like the photos taken online of those Tai Sui are a little different from this one. Zhou Wen searched the pictures online and compared them to the Tai Sui in front of him. They were indeed different.</p>
<p>Those Tai Suis looked ugly and were either black or yellow. They weren’t as smooth and white as Zhou Wen’s—it looked like white jade.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that my Tai Sui is different from theirs. Mine doesn’t bring misfortune, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Tai Sui bounced around on the ground like a white bouncy ball. Its fleshy look made it very interesting.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was looking at Tai Sui, the tiny beast woke up. When it got up and saw the two halves of the metal walnut on the ground, it immediately rushed over.</p>
<p>However, when it realized that there was nothing inside, it was stunned. It turned its head and saw Tai Sui in front of Zhou Wen and immediately pounced over.</p>
<p>Tai Sui seemed a little afraid of it as it immediately jumped behind Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out to grab the fur on the tiny beast’s back and lifted it up. The little beast desperately brandished its tiny claws as though it wanted to fight Zhou Wen to the death.</p>
<p>However, its claws were just too short. No matter how hard it tried, it couldn’t touch Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Come, be good. This is for you to eat… You’re not eating it? What about this?” Zhou Wen took out something to coax the little beast.</p>
<p>Finally, when Zhou Wen gave it an Epic Companion Egg, the little beast angrily sprawled on it and ate it. As it chewed, it glared at Zhou Wen and Tai Sui as though it was indignant.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen fed some Companion Eggs to Tai Sui. Tai Sui didn’t seem picky at all, but its eating speed was very slow.</p>
<p>Its body wrapped around the Companion Egg like liquid. It didn’t manage to digest it even after a long time.</p>
<p>After trying out Tai Sui’s Earth Escape skill, he realized that it was very useful. As long as it touched the ground, it could instantly move anywhere.</p>
<p>However, because Tai Sui’s level was too low, it couldn’t escape too far.</p>
<p>As for its companion form, it was somewhat magical. It could simulate the companion form of other Companion Beasts. It could transform into armor, weapons, and other forms. It could even simulate the appearance of a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>However, it only simulated its appearance, its essence didn’t change. It didn’t possess the ability of other Companion Beasts. It looked like a plasticine toy.</p>
<p>Although Tai Sui doesn’t have the legendary Misfortune, it doesn’t seem to be of any use. Realizing that Tai Sui was useless, Zhou Wen let it slowly eat and evolve. He wanted to see if it would be of any use in the future.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, are you at school?” An Sheng called.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“It’s best you don’t leave the school for the next few days,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>“Recently, Dragon Gate Grotto has been a little abnormal. According to Chancellor Leng’s judgment, Dragon Gate Grotto might encounter a large-scale breakout of creatures. When the time comes, we will do our best to prevent the breakout creatures from entering the city. As we don’t know how many breakout creatures will appear, we might need your help as a last resort,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll stay in school for the next few days.” After a pause, Zhou Wen asked, “Does this mean that the other dimensional zones will also experience a large-scale breakout?”</p>
<p>“We are closely monitoring them. From the looks of it, we haven’t discovered anything similar. The situation in Dragon Gate Grotto has changed. Perhaps something special is affecting them,” An Sheng said. “According to Chancellor Leng, some of the break-out creatures outside also came to Dragon Gate Grotto. It’s still a mystery what’s attracting them.”</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen heard that, he immediately thought of the giant golden bird above Dragon Gate Grotto. Back then, it was only when Chancellor Leng personally appeared that the giant golden bird retreated.</p>
<p>Not long after Zhou Wen received the news, Dragon Gate Grotto was sealed off by the military. In the next two days, the school had organized a mobilization meeting. The students had also been assigned some logistic work to assist the military in preventing the large-scale breakout.</p>
<p>The entire school’s atmosphere became abnormally tense. Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, and company were assigned work. In such a situation, no one could stay out of it.</p>
<p>That night, a roar that sounded like a cow’s moo came from Dragon Gate Grotto. The sound was soul-stirring. The ground near Dragon Gate Grotto shook as though there was a slight earthquake. The roar lasted the entire night, but nothing came out.</p>
<p>However, this cast a shadow on everyone’s hearts. This was because they were certain that something had really happened to Dragon Gate Grotto.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, if all of these dimensional zones suffer a breakout, do you think our Luoyang will still hold?” Li Xuan asked Zhou Wen as he moved the supplies.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid it can’t be defended.” Zhou Wen knew very well that humans were much weaker than dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>There appeared to be a hundred Mythical Companion Beasts on the ranking, but the number of Mythical creatures in the dimensional zones was far more than that. It might be a hundred or a thousand times more.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen even suspected that there were even more terrifying existences above the Mythical stage. Otherwise, Torch Dragon’s stats wouldn’t have the evolvable attribute.</p>
<h3 id='chapter665'>Chapter 665: The Battle Begins</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Over the next few days, many strange things happened in Dragon Gate Grotto.</p>
<p>A huge Buddha shed tears of blood for no reason. After careful inspection, it was discovered that there was a crack in the Buddha’s eye. Red spring water surged out from it.</p>
<p>In the river beside Dragon Gate Grotto, there were creatures that resembled flood dragons churning. However, the back they saw was dozens of meters long. It was extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>Inside a Buddhist temple, a Buddhist glow bloomed. Through a pair of binoculars, one could see a skeleton dressed in monk robes sitting inside the temple hall. Every inch of its skeleton emitted a Buddhistic glow.</p>
<p>The entire Grotto was filled with strange sights. The military had completely sealed off the nearby area. The area near Dragon Gate Grotto on campus had been evacuated.</p>
<p>The matter at Dragon Gate Grotto seemed to be even more terrifying than expected. Malla and Stone Beasts had already walked out of the cave. Many of the Malla and Stone Beasts were the students’ usual hunting targets—most of them were at the Mortal and Legendary stage.</p>
<p>However, they now had a strange halo enveloping them. Their Strength and Speed had increased greatly. The power that erupted at the Mortal stage could reach the peak of the Mortal stage. Those at the Legendary stage could produce strength at the peak Legendary stage.</p>
<p>There were also Flying Beasts and Fairies circling above Dragon Gate Grotto, making the originally mysterious cave even more bizarre.</p>
<p>Any dimensional creature that stepped out of the defense line was killed by the soldiers, but the situation kept worsening. There were more dimensional creatures that surged out with each day.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, and Feng Qiuyan were responsible for transporting the ammunition to the front line. This was a mission An Sheng had specially arranged for them so that they could participate in the battle at any time.</p>
<p>The school’s tutors were also prepared. When the battle really broke out, these Epic tutors were to be the main combat force.</p>
<p>Qin Wufu had already arrived at the battlefield to commandeer the troops, but An Tianzuo was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, you have to be careful. The anomaly in Dragon Gate Grotto is too terrifying. There might be a fierce battle when the time comes.” After An Sheng arrived on the battlefield, he warned Zhou Wen and company with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed. An Sheng knew that he had several Mythical Companion Beasts in his possession, but even so, he had solemnly warned him to be careful. It was obvious that the situation was extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>Li Xuan said, “Why don’t I see Overseer?”</p>
<p>An Sheng sighed softly and said, “Overseer has gathered all the noble families in Luoyang City for a meeting and is mobilizing them to participate in the battle.”</p>
<p>“It isn’t going well?” Zhou Wen looked at An Sheng’s expression and knew that things weren’t going well.</p>
<p>An Sheng said, “Sunset College is closest to Dragon Gate Grotto, but Sunset College has always been a home ground of the An family. They feel that helping this situation is helping the An family, so they are quite unwilling.”</p>
<p>“Don’t they know that once Sunset College fails, all of Luoyang will suffer?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>Even someone like him who had a bad relationship with An Tianzuo was participating in this battle. This was because he knew that this wasn’t the An family’s business. It concerned the survival of Luoyang.</p>
<p>“Some have already planned on leaving Luoyang to seek refuge,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Escape without fighting? Those people are even abandoning their homeland?” Feng Qiuyan frowned.</p>
<p>“That’s only human nature. If we manage to hold the line, they will naturally return. If we can’t, they will be able to preserve their strength and wealth. They will also be able to live free and mighty in other cities. However, ordinary citizens won’t share the same fate. Only death awaits them,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“How’s my family’s situation?” Li Xuan hadn’t received any news from his family. He didn’t know what was happening at home.</p>
<p>“Old Master Li didn’t say anything, but he didn’t leave Luoyang either. He seems to be taking a wait-and-see approach,” An Sheng replied.</p>
<p>“Adjutant An, I would like to make a remark on that.” Suddenly, they heard someone speak. They turned their heads and saw Li Mobai walking over with a dozen soldiers.</p>
<p>“Second Young Master Li, you’re finally here. We’ve been waiting for you for a long time.” An Sheng saw Li Mobai and the people behind him.</p>
<p>“All the Epic experts that the Li family can contribute are here. Including me, I’ll be at the Overseer’s disposal,” Li Mobai said.</p>
<p>“If the Li family is willing to help, why is Old Master Li unwilling to speak up for the Overseer during the meeting?” An Sheng asked.</p>
<p>Li Mobai smiled and said, “Our Li family is willing to fight to protect Luoyang. That’s our decision, but we can’t stop other families from seeking a chance to live.”</p>
<p>An Sheng immediately understood what he meant. All he could do was shake his head and sigh helplessly.</p>
<p>From this, one could tell that very few people from the major families in Luoyang were willing to participate.</p>
<p>“Second Young Master, please follow me. After registration, Governor Du will deploy you centrally,” An Sheng said as he prepared to lead them to the register.</p>
<p>“Second Brother…” Li Xuan called out with a strange expression when he saw Li Mobai looking at him.</p>
<p>Li Mobai said indifferently, “You don’t have to speak to me with such an attitude. I’ve never placed you in my heart. Among the Li brothers. I, Li Mobai, only acknowledge one elder brother. I only gave you the Evil King Gu as a tool for revenge. Since you can’t even be a tool, there’s no value in using you. You can do whatever you want.”</p>
<p>With that said, Li Mobai left with An Sheng.</p>
<p>Li Xuan gritted his teeth and didn’t say a word. All he did was clench his fists.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen patted Li Xuan on the shoulder. Li Xuan relaxed and shook his head. “Don’t worry. I know what I should do. I won’t lose myself because of his words.”</p>
<p>Over the next two days, some rich Luoyang families sent people to participate in the battle. However, most of them only sent one or two Epic experts. Apart from the Li family, there were only two other families who sent a formidable force.</p>
<p>On this day, just as Zhou Wen and company were loading the supplies, they suddenly heard an ear-piercing alarm. All the soldiers quickly rushed to their posts before they heard the rumbling sounds of cannons and gunshots.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company pushed the resources to the front lines and saw that in the direction of Dragon Gate Grotto, a large number of stone beasts and Malla were rushing out. There were also a number of flying beasts dancing in the air.</p>
<p>The tide of dimensional creatures charged at the defensive fortifications. The soldiers followed the commands and kept firing. The dimensional creatures fell, but more dimensional creatures took their fallen brethren and charged over.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A cannonball exploded in front of a Vajra Malla, but it failed to kill him. He charged over with the fragments of the cannonball still embedded in him and pounced ferociously at a soldier in the trench.</p>
<p>The soldier didn’t retreat. He summoned a Companion Beast saber and struck the Vajra Malla, forcing it to take two steps back.</p>
<p>The soldiers beside him shot at the Vajra Malla. They peppered it with a rain of bullets, blasting apart his head.</p>
<p>A Fairy swooped down from the sky. On the battlefield that was filled with flames of war, the beautiful figure turned into a killing machine. She gracefully charged into the soldiers and blood immediately dyed the trench red.</p>
<h3 id='chapter666'>Chapter 666: Thousand-Handed Bull-Headed Creature</h3>

<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The symphony of death and slaughter played crazily. A loud boom resounded through the sky as a three-headed, six-armed Vajra that stood more than ten meters tall charged out of Dragon Gate Grotto.</p>
<p>Bullets and artillery fire blasted him, but to no avail. With a wave of the monster-subduing phurba in his hand, a laser-like beam blasted a huge hole in the defensive fortification. Several soldiers died on the spot.</p>
<p>An Epic expert summoned his Companion Beasts to face it in battle. The Vajra fought four of them alone but managed to force all four Epic Companion Beasts into a retreat.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Amidst the flood of stone beasts, multiple three-headed, six-armed Vajras rushed out of Dragon Gate Grotto. Groups of Fairies also flew out into the sky. They were true Fairies, not Fairy Beasts.</p>
<p>There were also the black-clothed, white-haired Mutated Fairies. Furthermore, there were more than two of them.</p>
<p>Epic officers, tutors, and people from Luoyang’s major families took part in the battle. There were war cries and explosions everywhere on the battlefield as soldiers constantly fell.</p>
<p>“Are you interested in warming up?” An Sheng wore a smile, but his eyes were extremely cold.</p>
<p>“More than happy.” Feng Qiuyan summoned his saber.</p>
<p>“I’ve been waiting.” Li Xuan summoned out his carapace.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gripped his Bamboo Blade tightly and nodded slightly. He knew that this was really just a warm-up. The truly terrifying creatures had yet to come out.</p>
<p>An Sheng led them to the leftmost side of the defense line. The defense there was the weakest and had been repeatedly breached by the Fairies.</p>
<p>“Guard this place until the retreat order is given, you can’t retreat even in death,” An Sheng said to Zhou Wen and company before leaving.</p>
<p>The soldiers were crazily fending off the dimensional creatures’ attacks, but there were still three-headed, six-armed Vajras charging at them. It was something ordinary soldiers couldn’t deal with. The bullets that were imbued with Essence Gold couldn’t penetrate the Vajras’ bodies, nor could they hit the Fairies.</p>
<p>“Leave the sky to me. I’ll leave the ground to you.” Zhou Wen looked at the Fairies in the sky as they constantly charged down to cull the soldiers’ lives.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Feng Qiuyan and Li Xuan responded loudly at the same time before rushing out. Each of them faced a three-headed, six-armed Blackiron Vajra.</p>
<p>When the soldiers saw the two students rush out to fend off the Vajras, they were both surprised and delighted. They hurriedly opened fire to provide them cover, clearing the ordinary Vajras and stone beasts.</p>
<p>A few Fairies descended from the sky and flew over. The machine guns on the sentry post fired at them, but they failed to hit their bodies.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen soared into the sky as he unsheathed his Bamboo Blade and slashed out the Demonic Astral Wheel.</p>
<p>The blood-colored Demonic Astral Wheel flashed across the sky, killing several Fairies. Blood splattered everywhere.</p>
<p>The nearby soldiers were first taken aback before they cheered. At the very least, they saw a temporary hope. There were still humans who could fight these terrifying dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Gunfire, the roars of dimensional creatures, the roars of Companion Beasts, the screams of death—the collision of blood and fire were everywhere.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept killing Fairies. He lost count of the number he killed, but he was already beginning to feel numb. He usually couldn’t find so many Fairies, but now, there were as many as crows in the sky.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen even killed two Mutated Fairies.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan, Li Xuan, and company were already covered in blood. It was impossible to distinguish the blood on their bodies—theirs or the dimensional creatures’.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>In the direction of Dragon Gate Grotto, it was as though a mountain had exploded. A thousand-hand Buddha that was more than ten meters tall on the stone wall emitted a resplendent golden glow. It came to life and walked out of the mountain wall.</p>
<p>The thousand-hand Buddha looked extremely strange. Zhou Wen had never seen it before.</p>
<p>His body was shimmering with golden light. He had an ox head and a human body. He had eight arms and countless arms that resembled wheels on his back. He looked extremely demonic.</p>
<p>An Epic Companion Beast went forward to fight it off, only to see the thousand-handed, bull-headed beast shoot out a golden beam of light that blasted the Epic Companion Beast to pieces.</p>
<p>Then, the arms behind its back raised up and transformed into different spells. Golden light crisscrossed and instantly killed the nearby Companion Beasts and humans.</p>
<p>Mythical creature! Zhou Wen’s eyes narrowed. A Mythical creature had appeared so quickly, and one that was especially terrifying.</p>
<p>The dense bombardment of bullets and attacks struck the thousand-handed, bull-headed beast, but they were nothing but a tickle. They failed to hurt it at all.</p>
<p>It even blocked an Epic Companion Beast’s attack. As the thousand hands changed in form, the ground was sliced apart by the crisscrossing golden light. Amidst the golden light, a tank was sliced into two like paper.</p>
<p>Instantly, everyone was horrified. Such an invincible dimensional creature made it impossible for anyone to think of putting up a resistance.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to summon the Golden Overlord Sword to slay the thousand-handed, bull-headed beast, he saw a figure tear through the air. It was a flying sword that resembled a blue rainbow.</p>
<p>The flying sword circled the creature as it attempted to grab it with its thousand hands. However, it failed. Instead, the sword beam slashed out by the flying sword cleaved down on its numerous arms.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned his head to look at the spot where the flying sword had come from and saw a figure standing on the roof. It was none other than Sunset College’s chancellor, Leng Zongzheng.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but have a thought when he saw that the flying sword didn’t manage to slice through the thousand-handed, bull-headed creature despite having the advantage. He summoned the Golden Overlord Sword and sneaked behind the creature.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the fact that it was attracted by the flying sword, he leaped above its head. The Golden Overlord Sword slashed down at the ox head with a resplendent sword beam.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The thousand-handed, bull-headed creature collapsed to the ground. At the same time it died, the stone beasts, Fairies, and Vajras attacked even more crazily.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng glanced at Zhou Wen and summoned his sword back before turning to sit on a chair. He had no intention of coming down to clean up the battlefield.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally didn’t stand on ceremony. He went to the thousand-handed, bull-headed creature’s corpse to see if it had left anything good.</p>
<p>However, before he could reach the corpse, its body exploded. A terrifying blast instantly rushed towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly summoned the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon to block him. The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon roared as it spewed out dragon breath to block the terrifying blast.</p>
<p>And at the spot where the thousand-handed, bull-headed corpse was, a huge golden bull appeared. Its golden eyes were staring straight at him, and golden flames spewed out from its nostrils.</p>
<h3 id='chapter667'>Chapter 667: Battling the Golden Bull</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Leng Zongzheng was sitting on a chair on a skyscraper. He looked at the entire battlefield and his gaze landed on Zhou Wen, who was confronting the golden bull. He asked An Sheng, “Ah Sheng, is that student Zhou Wen?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Chancellor. He’s our Young Master Wen. What do you think of him?” An Sheng said respectfully.</p>
<p>“He’s a slippery one. He actually wanted to pick up freebies on the battlefield. He’s really greedy,” Leng Zongzheng said.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen only wants to help. He didn’t mean to snatch anything from you,” An Sheng hurriedly explained.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng didn’t say anything else. It was impossible to tell if he was angry or not.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen faced the golden bull-headed creature head-on and didn’t dare be careless. This was a battlefield. If he died, that would be it. Therefore, he didn’t charge at the golden bull-headed creature himself. Instead, he got Six-Winged Guardian Dragon to charge forward first.</p>
<p>Six-Winged Guardian Dragon didn’t fear death as it transformed into a black bolt of lightning and charged over. The six dragon wings slashed at the golden bull like blades.</p>
<p>The golden bull was massive, about the same size as a mammoth. It wasn’t at a disadvantage facing the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. When it saw Six-Winged Guardian Dragon charge at it, it roared and lowered its head to slam into it.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Due to the terrifying collision, a huge crater formed on the ground. The golden bull and Six-Winged Guardian Dragon were evenly matched and neither of them retreated.</p>
<p>Six-Winged’s front claws grabbed the horns on the golden bull’s head as the two monsters locked themselves in a stalemate.</p>
<p>Golden flames constantly spewed out from the golden bull’s nose. The dragon wings on Six-Winged’s back flapped wildly, but neither was able to gain the upper hand. It looked like their strength was about the same.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the Golden Overlord Sword and was about to lop off the golden bull’s head.</p>
<p>To his surprise, the golden bull’s head suddenly shook. A golden bell hanging around its neck rang the moment it shook its head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately felt his mind go blank when he heard the sound. He was momentarily dazed.</p>
<p>Six-Winged Guardian Dragon looked as though it was drunk. It staggered and involuntarily dispersed all the strength it exerted.</p>
<p>The golden bull roared as a pair of thick and huge golden horns slammed into Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s chest, piercing through its dragon scales and deeply impaling it.</p>
<p>Six-Winged… Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly summoned Six-Winged back.</p>
<p>Although Six-Winged’s combat strength was only considered average among Mythical creatures, its Life Protection was a rare protective Wheel of Destiny. Having it for so long, Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to see it die.</p>
<p>Six-Winged transformed into a stream of light and returned to Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief. As long as it wasn’t dead, it was good. Companion Beasts could slowly recover with their owner’s Essence Energy.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen didn’t have time to think too much. The golden bull was now targeting him. Zhou Wen hurriedly retreated and threw the Golden Overlord Sword in his hand.</p>
<p>The ringing of the golden bull’s bell had actually caused him and Six-Winged to suffer a mental blow, causing them to instantly feel dizzy. If he had been the one charging forward to fight the golden bull, he would probably have been killed.</p>
<p>Before figuring out the meaning of the bell, Zhou Wen didn’t dare approach the golden bull.</p>
<p>Although releasing Torch Dragon or Tyrant Behemoth was likely enough to finish it off, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to expose his two trump cards.</p>
<p>When the golden bull saw Zhou Wen retreat, it immediately charged forward. It looked like it hated Zhou Wen who had ambushed it.</p>
<p>The Golden Overlord Sword slashed at the golden bull autonomously. The golden sword beam was extremely sharp, but the golden bull managed to block the Golden Overlord Sword’s attack with its horns. The beams only left a shallow mark on the horns.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat dumbfounded when he saw this. The Golden Overlord Sword was augmented by Ever-Victorious and Unstoppable; yet, it only left a very shallow sword mark on the horns. The toughness of the horns was rather shocking.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>The Golden Overlord Sword and the horns constantly clashed. The shockwave produced by the collision shattered everything around them. Even Zhou Wen could only retreat a second time.</p>
<p>The golden bull wanted to catch up to Zhou Wen, but it couldn’t escape the Golden Overlord Sword’s entanglement. Therefore, it shook its neck again, ringing the bell once more.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already dozens of meters away from the battlefield. When he heard the bell, his mind jolted as he felt momentary dizziness. Thankfully, the dizziness was short-lived. Zhou Wen reacted and staggered two steps on the ground without falling.</p>
<p>As for a brainless Companion Beast like the Golden Overlord Sword, it actually showed signs of dizziness. Unguarded, it was sent flying by the golden bull’s horn.</p>
<p>The Golden Overlord Sword flew out like a meteor and slammed into the Dragon Gate Grotto’s stone wall. The sword immediately embedded itself into the stone wall.</p>
<p>What the hell is that bell? Does it actually have such a strange power? I used the Gods Retreat, but it was useless. From the looks of it, it isn’t a nomological force. Could it be a pure aural power? As Zhou Wen retreated, he summoned the Golden Overlord Sword back. He saw that there were many cracks on the Golden Overlord Sword’s blade.</p>
<p>Without the Gold Overlord Sword’s entanglement, the golden bull roared as it charged at Zhou Wen like a golden train that had gone amok.</p>
<p>An Sheng wanted to render his assistance, but he was stopped by Leng Zongzheng. “Don’t worry. That punk hasn’t done his best. Let’s wait and see.”</p>
<p>An Sheng also knew that Zhou Wen hadn’t used his full strength. After all, Tyrant Behemoth hadn’t appeared. However, it was best if he didn’t expose Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>With Leng Zongzheng’s extraordinary status, An Sheng couldn’t refute him. All he could do was stand by the side and continue watching.</p>
<p>Must I summon Torch Dragon to deal with it? Zhou Wen rushed out, but he couldn’t think of a way to deal with the bell on its neck.</p>
<p>In terms of combat abilities, the golden bull, Six-Winged, and Golden Overlord Sword were about equal. However, the bell on its neck was too bizarre, preventing Truth Listener and Gods Retreat from showing any effect.</p>
<p>If it’s only an aural power, Truth Listener should have reacted. Why isn’t even Truth Listener reacting? Zhou Wen was depressed.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen led the golden bull closer to Dragon Gate Grotto to prevent any further human casualties.</p>
<p>When the golden bull saw that it couldn’t catch up to Zhou Wen, it shook its head again. The bell rang again.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen was already prepared. He charged into the sky and switched to the Godfiend Era Essence Energy Art.</p>
<p>His head spun again, but due to the Godfiend Era’s spatial powers, Zhou Wen remained suspended in midair and didn’t fall.</p>
<p>When the golden bull saw that Zhou Wen didn’t fall, it leaped up and charged at him like a gigantic golden cannonball.</p>
<h3 id='chapter668'>Chapter 668: Bull Fight</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen had already recovered from his dizziness. Seeing the golden bull already in front of him, he hurriedly flew higher.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The golden bull’s leap lost its momentum as its body fell to the ground heavily, smashing a huge crater on the ground.</p>
<p>This fellow can’t fly? Zhou Wen was overjoyed. He pulled out his Bamboo Blade and slashed at the golden bull beneath him with Demonic Astral Wheel.</p>
<p>The golden bull defended with its horn, slamming into the Demonic Astral Wheel and shattering it. With a roar, it leaped up and lunged at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly flew higher, preventing the golden bull from touching him before it landed on the ground.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew the principle of kiting in gaming terms—retreating when the enemy advanced and chasing when the enemy retreated. The moment the golden bull landed, he swooped down and slashed out Demonic Astral Wheel with his Bamboo Blade.</p>
<p>The golden bull was infuriated. After landing on the ground, it leaped up once again and began to ring the bell in midair. However, Zhou Wen had already flown to a high altitude. Although his head was dizzy, he didn’t fall. The golden bull couldn’t jump high enough, so it couldn’t touch him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he engaged in guerilla warfare with the golden bull. At the same time, he lured the enraged golden bull towards Dragon Gate Grotto’s dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>When the infuriated golden bull landed, it immediately squashed many dimensional creatures. When it rang the bell, the dimensional creatures that were more than a hundred meters nearby were affected and became momentarily dizzy.</p>
<p>As such, the dimensional creatures’ offensive slowed down significantly, greatly reducing the pressure on the frontline soldiers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen lured the golden bull as it charged through the monster horde, causing great chaos.</p>
<p>A large number of Fairies flew towards Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen held the Bamboo Blade in one hand and the Overlord Sword in the other. Wherever the saber beams and sword beams went, blood splattered everywhere, unleashing pandemonium on the dimensional creatures at the rear.</p>
<p>The soldiers who were engaged in an intense battle saw that someone had stormed into the dimensional creatures’ horde alone. It was as though he had entered no man’s land. The blood in them pumped with zeal as they unleashed greater firepower.</p>
<p>Many Epic officers and tutors, who were in the midst of killing, felt their spirits lift. The pressure they felt seemed to lessen significantly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen lured the golden bull and constantly stormed through the dimensional creatures, but he failed to find a way to nullify the bell’s ringing.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the golden bull couldn’t fly, so it couldn’t threaten Zhou Wen’s safety.</p>
<p>The bell chimes from time to time only made Zhou Wen momentarily dizzy. By the time the Fairies surrounded him, Zhou Wen was already awake.</p>
<p>Even if he didn’t wake up in time, with the Golden Overlord Sword by his side, no matter how many Fairies came, they would all be killed with a single strike.</p>
<p>It’s definitely not an aural power. Otherwise, there’s no reason for me to be unable to withstand it at all. Even if it’s a spatial-type power, it’s impossible for me to have zero resistance. Could it be that the bell’s power is actually directly attacking the soul? Zhou Wen thought to himself as the golden bull went crazy from Zhou Wen’s teasing.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>The golden bull leaped up and repeatedly vibrated the bell in midair. Zhou Wen immediately felt as though his brain was about to explode as he hugged his head and moaned in pain.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the bell’s range was huge. The surrounding Fairies were also affected in worse ways than Zhou Wen. They screamed and fell from the sky.</p>
<p>After the golden bull landed, it took a few steps back and pawed its hoof on the ground a few times. With a sudden run, it leaped up and reached a record-breaking height. The thick horns on its head slammed into Zhou Wen, who was hugging his head in midair. The bell kept ringing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt as though his brain had been struck by a hammer. The pain left his mind blank.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen also knew that the golden bull would definitely deliver a fatal strike at this moment. His willpower was much stronger than that of the average person. Furthermore, when he cultivated the Lost Immortal Sutra in the early days, the Lost Immortal Sutra kept chanting incantations into his ears all day, making his mind more resilient.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, Zhou Wen could persist by sheer willpower alone and use Lost Country’s teleportation ability.</p>
<p>Almost at the instant Zhou Wen teleported out, two bodies rushed to where he was.</p>
<p>One figure was naturally the golden bull, and the other figure was Li Xuan, who was wearing his carapace. He had insect wings on his back.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, what’s going on?” Li Xuan had originally rushed over to save Zhou Wen, but to his surprise, Zhou Wen had vanished. The raging golden bull charged at Li Xuan.</p>
<p>The insect wings on Li Xuan’s back flapped as he narrowly avoided the golden bull’s horns. He somersaulted and ended up landing on the golden bull’s back. He hugged the ox head and cried out, “Old Zhou, I’m in deep shit because of you. Why didn’t you run earlier when you could?”</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen teleported into the distance, he used Ghost Steps to widen the distance again. When he heard Li Xuan, he turned his head and saw Li Xuan sprawled on the golden bull, shouting.</p>
<p>The golden bull angrily jumped around, trying to shake Li Xuan off, but Li Xuan seemed to be stuck to its back. It couldn’t shake him off.</p>
<p>What was strange was that the golden bull’s bell was useless against him.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan, are you immune to the bull’s bell?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“I just find it a little noisy. Nothing else. I say, quickly think of a way to get me down…” Li Xuan shouted.</p>
<p>“I heard that insects don’t have brains. Could it be that the bell’s strength is really a mental attack? That’s why it’s useless against the brainless Li Xuan?” Zhou Wen muttered to himself.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen didn’t really think that Li Xuan was brainless, but that his Life Soul was problematic. After all, he had absorbed the Evil King Gu’s Life Soul. It could be said that it was a fusion of two Life Souls. It was indeed stronger than the mental strength of an average person’s Life Soul, so it was very likely the reason it could withstand the bell’s soul-stirring chimes.</p>
<p>“Hold on a little longer. I’ll soon think of a way to resolve the golden bull.” Zhou Wen didn’t immediately rush back when he saw that Li Xuan’s life wasn’t in danger.</p>
<p>It was mainly because it was useless for him to rush back now unless he summoned his Companion Beasts like Truth Listener, Torch Dragon, and Tyrant.</p>
<p>“Bro, can you hurry up? I’m getting a little cowsick…” Li Xuan cried out with a long face. He didn’t dare get off the bull’s back, afraid that he would be killed by it the moment he got off.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that the golden bull was extremely irritated and didn’t chase after him. It wanted to throw Li Xuan down and kill him. Immediately, his heart stirred as he gripped the Golden Overlord Sword tightly and secretly changed his direction.</p>
<p>The Golden Overlord Sword and Bamboo Blade constantly slew the nearby dimensional creatures, reducing them to rivers of blood.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan, agitate it a little,” Zhou Wen shouted.</p>
<p>Li Xuan steeled his mind and reached out his hands to grab the bull’s ears, yanking at them ruthlessly.</p>
<p>The golden bull flew into a rage as it raised its hind legs and twisted its body in midair, hoping to throw Li Xuan off.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen finally saw an opportunity and threw the Golden Overlord Sword like a javelin.</p>
<p>The Golden Overlord Sword transformed into a golden bolt of lightning. At the moment the golden bull raised its hind legs to shake Li Xuan off, the sword pierced through it, slicing something off.</p>
<p>“Ow!” The golden bull’s eyes widened to the limit, but its pupils shrank into needle-like slits. It opened its mouth and let out a strange cry.</p>
<h3 id='chapter669'>Chapter 669: Resentful Chancellor</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>After being severely injured, the golden bull seemed to lose all its strength. It fell to the ground and let out a tragic cry as though it had lost the ability to resist.</p>
<p>“Get out of the way!” Zhou Wen roared as he cleaved down the Bamboo Blade at the golden bull’s neck.</p>
<p>Li Xuan ducked to the side. The golden bull seemed to be in so much pain that it forgot how to dodge. When Zhou Wen’s Bamboo Blade slashed at its neck, a metallic clang sounded. A long gash appeared on its neck as blood immediately gushed out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s other hand had already grabbed the Golden Overlord Sword and slashed. The golden bull was completely at Zhou Wen’s mercy. It didn’t resist as Zhou Wen’s cleaved through more than half its neck.</p>
<p>“No good. Retreat quickly!” Zhou Wen felt a sense of danger when he saw a strange aura emit from the golden bull. As he shouted, he flew backward.</p>
<p>Li Xuan wasn’t slow either, but before the duo could run far, the golden bull’s body exploded like a nuclear bomb. The terrifying power destroyed everything in a radius of two to three hundred meters.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were sent flying by the shockwave. They tumbled far away before stopping. The armor on their bodies was in shambles, and blood stained their backs.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen got up and looked in the direction of the golden bull’s self-detonation. He saw a crystal and a Companion Egg drop on the ground. He couldn’t help but be delighted.</p>
<p>Ignoring the injuries on his body, Zhou Wen quickly rushed towards the crystal and Companion Egg. The golden bull was so awesome that it had dropped two items at once. It was the best.</p>
<p>Furthermore, its bell had a strange power. If he could hatch such a golden bull and make it his pet, it would be quite useful.</p>
<p>However, before Zhou Wen could reach the Companion Egg, he saw a white figure flash past. Then, the golden bull Companion Egg on the ground vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly turned his head and saw a white parrot hold the Companion Egg in its claws as it flew through the air. Its speed was shockingly fast, and in an instant, it had already flown to the top of a skyscraper and landed on Leng Zongzheng’s shoulder. The Companion Egg in its claw had landed in Leng Zongzheng’s hand.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng held the Companion Egg in his hand as he looked at Zhou Wen with a faint smile. It was as though he was saying: ‘Since you snatched from me once, I’ll snatch from you too.’</p>
<p>What kind of chancellor is this? Is he that petty? Zhou Wen muttered inwardly as he rushed over to pick up the dimensional crystal.</p>
<p>The dimensional crystal was like a golden crystal. Inside was the shadow of a bull. It was clearly an Essence Energy Skill Crystal.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t obtain the Companion Egg, obtaining an Essence Energy Skill Crystal was a form of consolation.</p>
<p>With the death of the golden bull, humanity’s counterattack began. The firepower became more intense. The human Epic experts also used their Companion Beasts to fight, executing dimensional creatures on the spot.</p>
<p>As no new dimensional creatures rushed out, the terrifying dimensional creatures were finally suppressed. All the dimensional creatures that charged out of Dragon Gate Grotto were killed.</p>
<p>Although they had obtained victory, there was very little joy on their faces. Many soldiers and officers had sacrificed themselves, so most wore solemn expressions.</p>
<p>The soldiers began clearing the battlefield. Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, and Feng Qiuyan retreated and returned to their temporary encampment to rest. They still needed to continue delivering the supplies in a while.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s injuries had already healed, but Zhou Wen couldn’t recover that quickly. Although the wounds on his back weren’t bleeding, they had a burning sensation. All he could do was lie in the tent and rest.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan was so tired that he fell asleep the moment he collapsed onto the blanket. He had killed so many dimensional creatures that his stamina and Essence Energy were severely drained.</p>
<p>“It’s already so terrifying with Dragon Gate Grotto suffering a breakout. If all the dimensional zones in Luoyang were to encounter a breakout, it would be unimaginable. There’s no way humans can survive,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shared the same thoughts. Up to now, the difference between humans and dimensional zones was still huge.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, do you think another dimensional creature will rush out of Dragon Gate Grotto?” Li Xuan asked again.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to say so, but this matter definitely isn’t over. The giant golden bird on the mountaintop, as well as the monsters in the water, and the skeleton in monk robes in the temple haven’t moved yet,” Zhou Wen said as he used his phone to snap a picture of the Essence Energy Skill Crystal he had just obtained.</p>
<p>Great Might Vajra Bull Crystal: Mythical</p>
<p>Absorption Requirement: Constitution 41, Essence Energy 41, Buddhist Essence Energy Art</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the requirement. Although it didn’t have any special stat requirements, he couldn’t meet the two 41 stat requirements. All he could do was put the Essence Energy Crystal away.</p>
<p>After the battle, Dragon Gate Grotto temporarily calmed down. Without any dimensional creatures rushing out, Zhou Wen and company could rest.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, how are your injuries? I’ve brought you some medicine.” An Sheng walked in with a smile, holding a small bottle in his hand.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. I’ve almost recovered. I’ll be fine after some rest.” Zhou Wen was wearing Runic Heavy-Armor during the battle, so his injuries weren’t serious. He just needed some time to recover.</p>
<p>After all, he wasn’t Li Xuan. He didn’t have such potent self-recovery abilities.</p>
<p>“This medicine is good. It’ll heal you quickly once it’s applied. I’ll apply some for you.” An Sheng opened the medicine bottle and dripped the liquid on Zhou Wen’s wound. Zhou Wen immediately felt a refreshing feeling envelop his wound, making him feel much better.</p>
<p>An Sheng applied the medicine evenly on his wound and said, “Today, the three of you were amazing. Many of the men are talking about the three of you. All of you are considered famous now. If any of you wish to enter the Sunset Army in the future, you will definitely be protected by the soldiers.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as Li Xuan said with a smile, “That’s for sure. When I was young, a fortune-teller told me that I had the life of a general. I’ll definitely become a senior official in the future.”</p>
<p>“Third Young Master, if you wish to join the Sunset Army, I guarantee that I’ll leave a good position for you,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“We’ll see when the time comes. There are still two to three years before graduation,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>An Sheng naturally understood that Li Xuan was only making small talk. The Li family might not be willing to let him enter the Sunset Army.</p>
<p>An Sheng was about to say something when a soldier hurriedly came over and said, “Adjutant An, there’s something happening at Dragon Gate Grotto. Deputy Governor Qin requests your presence.”</p>
<p>“Do you want us to go with you?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. All of you can rest. If something really happened, Deputy Governor Qin wouldn’t be so at ease to get someone to invite me over,” An Sheng said as he left Zhou Wen’s tent.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen and company didn’t go, they soon learned what had happened. A strange scene appeared in Dragon Gate Grotto’s Alchemy Cave. A black smoke surged out and enveloped the entire entrance of the Alchemy Cave. Furthermore, they could hear the screams of wraiths and resentful ghosts in the black smoke.</p>
<p>However, that was all. No dimensional creatures rushed out.</p>
<h3 id='chapter670'>Chapter 670: Invisible Enemy</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>When Zhou Wen was resting, he summoned a few Companion Beasts to guard the inside of the tent. Tai Sui was restlessly emitting a burning sensation, so Zhou Wen had no choice but to release it.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, where did these strange Companion Beasts come from?” Li Xuan curiously sized up the Companion Beasts Zhou Wen had summoned.</p>
<p>“Some of them were bought. Some were obtained when I was out training,” Zhou Wen said as he lay down to rest.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan had already fallen asleep and didn’t chat with Li Xuan. All he could do was lie down and sleep as well.</p>
<p>He slept until midnight when he suddenly heard a commotion outside. He didn’t know what was happening.</p>
<p>“Why is it so noisy in the dead of the night? Could it be that the dimensional creatures in Dragon Gate Grotto have rushed out again?” Li Xuan said gloomily when he was woken up from his beauty sleep.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Feng Qiuyan sat up as well. Just as they were about to head out to take a look, they suddenly saw the tent door open. Then, they saw An Sheng barge in. He asked anxiously, “Young Master Wen, are you alright?”</p>
<p>“We’re fine. What can happen to us?” Li Xuan asked An Sheng in puzzlement.</p>
<p>An Sheng carefully sized up the three of them and heaved a long sigh of relief after a long while. “It’s good that you’re fine. Stay here and don’t go out. Something happened outside. After it’s settled, you can leave.”</p>
<p>“What happened?” Zhou Wen asked An Sheng.</p>
<p>“See for yourself.” An Sheng pointed outside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company looked out through the crack and were immediately so shocked that their jaws nearly dropped to the ground.</p>
<p>On the ground, walls, and tents outside, there were all kinds of mushrooms of different colors.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, when did this place become a mushroom base?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“Take a closer look at the soldiers outside,” An Sheng said with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>As An Sheng said that, Zhou Wen noticed that a soldier’s face was covered in what seemed like a pimple breakout. It was filled with many tiny mushrooms.</p>
<p>Although the mushrooms looked pretty, they made one’s hair stand on end when they were sprouting from a person’s face.</p>
<p>The soldier’s face was filled with horror. He was clawing at the mushrooms on his face, but just as he pulled out one, another mushroom would emerge.</p>
<p>He kept pulling them out, leaving his face covered in blood, but the little mushrooms kept popping out. He was so frightened that he was already crying. He was plucking the mushrooms from his face as he cried.</p>
<p>There were many people like him. Although there were already officers controlling the situation, this fear made them lose their usual calm. The scene was very chaotic.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company’s legs turned limp as they subconsciously touched their faces. Thankfully, there weren’t any mushrooms growing on their faces.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Zhou Wen asked An Sheng.</p>
<p>“I don’t know yet. We’re investigating. In the entire encampment, only a handful of people haven’t been infected with that strange thing. It’s probably related to the phenomena at Alchemy Cave. You guys stay here for now. In a while, I might need you to cooperate with me for the investigations. I hope we can find out why some aren’t growing mushrooms.” An Sheng’s expression was solemn as he rushed out.</p>
<p>“It’s really a blessing from the heavens that it didn’t infect us. Otherwise, I wouldn’t know how to live if my handsome face was destroyed,” Li Xuan said with lingering fear as he zipped up the tent.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s as simple as heaven’s blessing. There must be something that prevented us from being infected by those mushrooms.” Zhou Wen looked around and didn’t see anything amiss.</p>
<p>There weren’t any mushrooms in their tent. The three of them and his few Companion Beasts were fine. Tai Sui was lying near the tent’s entrance, doing something there.</p>
<p>Since it was something invisible to the naked eye, Zhou Wen used the Truth Listener earring’s ability to listen. Furthermore, he pushed it to its limits.</p>
<p>Upon hearing his surroundings, he immediately discovered a problem.</p>
<p>At the tent’s entrance, there were many microbial things that humans couldn’t see with the naked eye. They were undergoing random walks in the air.</p>
<p>Those tiny objects were even smaller than dust. If Zhou Wen hadn’t deliberately used Truth Listener to observe them, he wouldn’t have discovered them. Even using Truth Listener’s hearing, Zhou Wen hadn’t noticed them in the beginning.</p>
<p>The reason why he discovered their existence was that Tai Sui was actually devouring those little things. He looked like he was enjoying himself.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen expanded Truth Listener’s range and soon discovered that there were many such tiny objects in the air outside. They were even smaller than dust, so humans couldn’t see them at all. However, when they landed on the skin or something else, they would burrow into their pores and quickly sprout to grow tiny mushrooms.</p>
<p>As they were so small, no one discovered them. The entire encampment was filled with such tiny objects, as though it was snowing.</p>
<p>However, there were very few people who could see them apart from Zhou Wen. All the soldiers were at a loss as danger floated around them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out and tried grabbing them, but he realized that his palm couldn’t grab them at all. They were too small, so it was useless to grab them. They were like bacteria. Despite knowing that they were there, it was very difficult to eliminate them.</p>
<p>Tai Sui was actually able to discover them and even eat them. It’s quite impressive. Zhou Wen saw that Tai Sui had already finished all the tiny objects in the tent. He was eager to head out to eat more.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that the three of them were fine because Tai Sui was here. It had eaten all the little things that had invaded their quarters, preventing them from being infected.</p>
<p>The military had clearly realized the problem as well. Some soldiers in antibacterial suits were spewing chemicals to remove bacteria and fungus from the encampment.</p>
<p>However, it was useless. Those things were clearly not something ordinary chemicals could deal with.</p>
<p>“Don’t go out yet. I’ll take a look at the entrance,” Zhou Wen said to Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan before opening the tent door.</p>
<p>The moment the door opened, many of those little creatures entered with the gust of wind that entered. Tai Sui immediately jumped around excitedly and devoured the little creatures that humans couldn’t see.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used an Essence Energy Skill, Small Fireball, that dropped from the Metalwork Temple. A scarlet flame ball flew out from his fingertip and hit the invisible things in the air.</p>
<p>The tiny objects were burned to ashes by the flames. They didn’t appear very strong, but because they were so tiny, they couldn’t be discovered. That was also why they were so dangerous.</p>
<p>After burning a few tiny objects to death, Zhou Wen suddenly realized in surprise that a tiny Companion Egg dropped. The Companion Egg was even smaller than the tiny objects. If not for Truth Listener’s ability. Zhou Wen wouldn’t have seen it at all.</p>
<p>He took out his phone and snapped a picture of the tiny Companion Egg. It was immediately stored on his phone.</p>
<p>Those little things are really dimensional creatures! After Zhou Wen saw the Companion Egg’s stats, he realized the true origins of the little creatures.</p>
<p>Parasite Spore: Mortal</p>
<h3 id='chapter671'>Chapter 671: The Weakest Companion Beast in History</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Parasite Spore: Mortal</p>
<p>Strength: 0</p>
<p>Speed: 1</p>
<p>Constitution: 1</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 1</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Parasitizing</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>These stats are so weak, aren’t they? Zhou Wen had never seen a Companion Beast with such weak stats. However, although they were very weak, they had their own advantages. Even Epic experts would be in great pain and trouble if they got parasitized by not being careful.</p>
<p>Tai Sui had already rolled out and jumped around excitedly, devouring all the Parasite Spores it could see.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t continue killing the spores. Firstly, there were too many. Ordinary skills couldn’t kill them all. Secondly, there were still many soldiers and officers in the encampment, so it wasn’t appropriate for him to use large-scale skills to kill the spores.</p>
<p>I can still remove the Parasite Spores outside, but how can I deal with the Parasite Spores that have already parasitized people? Zhou Wen pushed Truth Listener’s powers to the limits as he wanted to observe if all the spores were the same.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen realized that most of the spores were transparent and slightly white. These were identical to the Companion Egg which dropped.</p>
<p>A small portion of the Parasite Spores was light red in color. There were very few of them. Zhou Wen tried killing some of them, but the dimensional crystals that dropped were all at the Legendary stage and their stats were very low.</p>
<p>It was very rare for Mortal spores to drop Companion Eggs. Zhou Wen had killed many, but no Companion Eggs dropped. The Mortal Companion Egg from before could only be attributed to luck.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked behind Tai Sui. Wherever Tai Sui passed, the spores dodged it as though they were avoiding the plague. Most of them failed to dodge in time and were swallowed by Tai Sui.</p>
<p>As he walked, Zhou Wen discovered another golden spore but killing it was as simple as the others. A tiny fireball killed the golden spore.</p>
<p>There were extremely few golden spores. Among the countless spores, it was probably a one in a billion existence. Zhou Wen found a few and after killing them, a Companion Egg dropped.</p>
<p>Golden Parasite Spore: Epic</p>
<p>Life Providence: Microbe</p>
<p>Life Soul: Parasitizing Spirit</p>
<p>Strength: 18</p>
<p>Speed: 20</p>
<p>Constitution: 17</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 20</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Parasitizing</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>This Epic Companion Beast has also broken the record for the lower limits of an Epic Companion Beast. I originally imagined that the weakest one would be the baby tiger, but I never expected there to be an Epic Companion Beast weaker than it. Furthermore, it’s much weaker. Zhou Wen realized that the spores were indeed weak. They could survive simply because of their microscopic bodies.</p>
<p>Ordinary Legendary humans could easily kill such Epic creatures. The real difficulty wasn’t killing them, but how to discover them.</p>
<p>The higher the level of the spores, the smaller their sizes. Even Truth Listener’s ability could barely see the Golden Parasite Spore.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen discovered a tiny purple dot floating around. It appeared and disappeared at times. Even with Truth Listener’s ability, it nearly failed to detect its existence. It was just too small.</p>
<p>Could it be a Mythical spore? Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he hurriedly got Tai Sui to roll over.</p>
<p>Even the Mythical spore was afraid of the Mortal Tai Sui. Just as it was about to run, it was burned by Zhou Wen’s fireball.</p>
<p>However, this time, the purple spore wasn’t burned to death. It continued floating far away. Zhou Wen pulled out the Golden Overlord Sword and slashed with a powerful sword beam.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Although it was very small, the sword beam’s area was large enough, so it still managed to strike the tiny creature.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s surprise, the Golden Sword Aura failed to kill it.</p>
<p>This spore is interesting. Zhou Wen used a few more skills and realized that he couldn’t kill the purple spore.</p>
<p>At that moment, Tai Sui had already rolled over. It leaped up and pounced at the purple spore.</p>
<p>The purple spore that couldn’t even be killed by weapons trembled as though it had encountered a nemesis. It was sucked up by Tai Sui.</p>
<p>Seeing that the purple spore had been sucked into Tai Sui’s body, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but sigh. It’s true that one object bests another. For a Mortal-stage Tai Sui to be able to restrain a Mythical spore, this guy is quite useful. In the future, with Tai Sui by my side, I won’t be afraid of being ambushed by microbial Companion Beasts and dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>“I say, Tai Sui, don’t just focus on eating. Did it leave behind any Companion Eggs or dimensional crystals?” Zhou Wen didn’t hold much hope as he asked casually.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Tai Sui really understood him. It reluctantly spat out a microscopic purple object.</p>
<p>Even with Truth Listener’s ability, he nearly missed it. After falling to the ground, he searched for quite a while before finding the tiny point.</p>
<p>He hurriedly pulled out his phone and took a picture of the purple point.</p>
<p>Primordial Spore: Mythical</p>
<p>Life Providence: Eternal Immortality</p>
<p>Life Soul: Parasitizing Spirit</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Soul Parasitizing</p>
<p>Strength: 41</p>
<p>Speed: 41</p>
<p>Constitution: 41</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 41</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Parasitizing</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>Without a doubt, this was the weakest Mythical Companion Beast that Zhou Wen had ever seen. There was nothing worse. Its extreme weakness could be seen just by looking at its stats.</p>
<p>However, such Companion Beasts weren’t meant for combat. Their effects might be even more terrifying than combat-type Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>He directly hatched the Primordial Spore and expended very little Essence Energy. It was about the same as the Essence Energy needed for Epic Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Thankfully, as its owner, Zhou Wen could sense its location. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have known where his tiny Companion Beast was if he only looked at it with his eyes.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>After testing it out, he used the Primordial Spore to kill the ordinary spores. Although it was feasible, the combat ability of the Primordial Spore wasn’t high. It wasn’t killing as fast as Zhou Wen’s fireballs, much less competing with Tai Sui’s devouring.</p>
<p>Tai Sui jumped around in the encampment and swallowed countless spores. Its body clearly became bigger, and the spores in the encampment decreased significantly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to search the entire time, hoping to find another Primordial Spore. However, he was somewhat disappointed and didn’t discover a second one.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, why did you come out? The situation outside is terrible. You shouldn’t have come out.” An Sheng arrived in front of the clearing. Qin Wufu, Leng Zongzheng, as well as the military’s generals and tutors, were with him.</p>
<p>However, despite there being so many people, other than An Sheng and Leng Zongzheng, there were mushrooms on everyone’s faces. They looked extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>Even Deputy Governor Qin succumbed to it? Zhou Wen saw a golden mushroom on Qin Wufu’s face. It was likely an Epic Golden Spore that parasitized his face.</p>
<p>Although Ah Sheng’s body was covered in spores, the spores didn’t drill into his body for some reason.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng didn’t have any spores on him. His body seemed to be protected by an invisible force, preventing the spores from approaching him.</p>
<p>“It’s not difficult to remove the spores in the encampment, but the spores that have already parasitized people require another solution.” Leng Zongzheng looked at the mushrooms in the encampment and summoned his Demonic Organ Throne.</p>
<h3 id='chapter672'>Chapter 672: Tai Sui’s Evolution</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Leng Zongzheng played the Demonic Organ Throne with his long, slender fingers, immediately producing magical music. It was grand and solemn, imbued with a holy feeling that other musical instruments didn’t possess.</p>
<p>Invisible ripples spread out across the encampment. Zhou Wen was surprised to discover that with the music, the invisible spores were gathering in front of the Demonic Organ Throne like soldiers that had received an order.</p>
<p>The spores were originally barely visible, but due to their numbers, one could gradually see a faint white mist as more and more spores gathered.</p>
<p>The fog became thicker and thicker, and soon, people could see it more clearly.</p>
<p>Originally, Tai Sui couldn’t eat many spores despite bouncing around. Now that the spores had gathered in a region, it became excited. It bounced amidst the white mist formed by the spores. As it consumed a large number of spores, it also grew in size.</p>
<p>The organ music continued as large amounts of spores gathered in a spot. They gradually turned corporeal, like snowflakes.</p>
<p>Finally, the snowflakes gathered together and turned into a white ball that resembled cotton candy.</p>
<p>Tai Sui bounced over and swallowed the cotton candy-like spores in no time. No one knew how many spores it had eaten as the number was already impossible to estimate.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen vaguely felt that Tai Sui was about to evolve, he hurriedly summoned it back.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng didn’t stop Tai Sui from devouring the spores. He only glanced at Zhou Wen before saying to An Sheng, “The mushrooms in the encampment must be burned. They can’t be left behind at all to ensure that there are no latent dangers.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll do it now.” An Sheng received the order and led his men to clear the mushrooms in the encampment.</p>
<p>“Chancellor, the mushrooms in the encampment are easy to deal with. What should we do with the ones on the soldiers?” Qin Wufu asked worriedly.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng said, “If these spores hadn’t parasitized a body, it wouldn’t be difficult to remove them. However, once they carried out the parasitization, they became a part of the body. It’s like the flesh and blood of the body. Even if one slices off the flesh, the self-healing ability of the body will regrow it. It’s very difficult to remove it at the root.”</p>
<p>Qin Wufu and company revealed looks of worry when they heard that.</p>
<p>“You, come with me,” Leng Zongzheng suddenly said to Zhou Wen before he left.</p>
<p>It can’t be, right? Don’t tell me Chancellor Leng is such a petty person. Is he going to settle scores for letting Tai Sui eat the spores? Zhou Wen followed Leng Zongzheng to his office in a somewhat depressed manner.</p>
<p>“Take a seat.” Leng Zongzheng’s office was different from the offices of ordinary chancellors. Instead of calling it an office, it was more like a tea room.</p>
<p>“Chancellor Leng, it’s my fault for letting my Companion Beast eat the spores without your permission…” Zhou Wen first admitted his mistake to prevent Leng Zongzheng from lecturing him.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng didn’t mention this matter. He sat at the tea table and said as he brewed tea, “Do you hate me for snatching the Companion Egg?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head and said, “That was originally your prey. It’s only right for you to take the Companion Egg. Why would I have such thoughts?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen really meant it. It was Leng Zongzheng who had attacked the thousand-handed, bull-headed creature first. He was trying to scoop up the benefits but ended up being taken advantage of by Leng Zongzheng. There was nothing to be said. He could only blame himself for not being fast enough.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, Leng Zongzheng smiled and placed a cup of brewed tea in front of him. Then, he continued, “Do you know the origins of that golden bull?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only knew that the bull was called the Great Might Vajra Bull. As for its origins, he really didn’t know anything. All he could do was shake his head.</p>
<p>“The golden bull’s former thousand-handed form is an imitation of Great Might Virtue Vajra. Great Might Virtue Vajra was a guardian Vajra of Tantric Buddhism. It was able to subdue evil demons, so it was known as having great might. It had the virtues of defending the good, so it was also known as having great virtue. There are also titles such as Yamāntaka, Vajrabhairava, and Bull-Headed Wisdom King. Previously, Tibetans believed that the Great Might Virtue Vajra was the wrath of Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī, so it had great might and terrifying power,” Leng Zongzheng said as he put down his teacup.</p>
<p>“Does that mean that the golden bull is the true body of the mighty Great Might Virtue Vajra?” Zhou Wen said in surprise. He never expected the golden bull to have such a huge background.</p>
<p>However, Leng Zongzheng said with a smile, “If it was the real Great Might Virtue Vajra, it wouldn’t have been so easy for you to kill it. At most, it can only be considered an embodiment.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, It’s no wonder that the golden bull is called the Great Might Vajra Bull. So it’s related to the Great Might Virtue Vajra. However, why is Principal Leng telling me this?</p>
<p>As though he had seen through Zhou Wen’s thoughts, Leng Zongzheng took out an item from the drawer beside him and placed it on the table. It was the Great Might Vajra Bull Companion Egg.</p>
<p>However, the Great Might Vajra Bull Companion Egg was somewhat different from before. There were thin lines drawn on it. They crisscrossed and looked like a more popular magic circle in the West District, but there were some symbols that looked like something from Tantric Buddhism that emitted strange energy fluctuations.</p>
<p>“I’ve already dealt with this Companion Egg. Even at the Epic stage, you will be able to incubate it. Do you want it?” Leng Zongzheng said with a faint smile.</p>
<p>“Will you believe me if I say I don’t, Chancellor?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng laughed. “Since you want it, take it.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Zhou Wen felt that there was no free lunch in this world. How could anyone be so kind? They had paid such a huge price to deal with the Mythical Companion Egg only to give it to him.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng said, “I’m afraid there’s no way to resolve the problems in Dragon Gate Grotto from outside. In the end, we can only enter. That’s a Buddhist land. When the time comes, this Companion Egg will definitely be of great use. Perhaps it can save lives, so those who have it have to enter Dragon Gate Grotto. You contributed to its birth, so you are the first person I’m asking. If you are going, just hatch it. If you aren’t going, I hope you can leave it to others.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat hesitant when he heard that. He naturally wanted the Great Might Vajra Bull, but Dragon Gate Grotto was extremely dangerous. If he entered it during this period of time, something ominous would definitely happen.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng didn’t hurry him, nor did he say a word. All he did was drink his tea and wait for Zhou Wen’s decision.</p>
<p>“If I don’t go, will you use this Companion Egg?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng shook his head. “I have other things to do. I don’t have the time to control it.”</p>
<p>“Then who do you plan on getting?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“If you don’t want it, the next candidate should be Tianzuo. I believe he won’t reject it,” Leng Zongzheng said.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll go.” Although Zhou Wen had some guesses, he couldn’t help but feel a little moved when he heard that An Tianzuo might obtain the Companion Egg. After some thought, he agreed to enter Dragon Gate Grotto.</p>
<p>“Take the Companion Egg and hatch it as soon as possible. The opportunity to enter Dragon Gate Grotto should be in the next few days,” Leng Zongzheng said with a smile.</p>
<h3 id='chapter673'>Chapter 673: Clearing the Parasite Spores</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen returned to his dorm with the Great Might Vajra Bull Companion Egg. He originally considered entering Dragon Gate Grotto, but when he saw Feng Qiuyan in the tent, he was shocked.</p>
<p>He saw two mushrooms growing on Feng Qiuyan’s face.</p>
<p>“Why are there mushrooms on your face?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Before he left, he had already gotten Tai Sui to clean up the spores in the tent. After sealing the tent, there shouldn’t have been any problems.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan said with a smile, “I’m fine. I was just curious. I unzipped the tent and wanted to take a look at the situation outside, but who knew that I would succumb to it? However, it’s not a big deal. There should be a way to resolve it.”</p>
<p>“In your dreams. The military experts and tutors are studying the Parasite Spores, but they still haven’t found a way to eliminate the mushrooms. Do you know that many soldiers have fainted because of the mushrooms? They might be like vegetative humans that won’t wake up again.” Zhou Wen was somewhat anxious.</p>
<p>“Then what should we do? I originally imagined that Brother Sheng was fine when he came. We just wanted to see the situation outside and didn’t even go out. I originally imagined that nothing would happen, but I never expected Little Yanyan to fall victim,” Li Xuan said gloomily.</p>
<p>“You’re fine?” Zhou Wen sized up Li Xuan. Feng Qiuyan had fallen victim. Logically speaking, with the numerous spores, it was impossible for only two to float in. It was odd that Li Xuan hadn’t succumbed to it.</p>
<p>“It should be because I’m wearing my carapace. I don’t have any mushrooms growing on me,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“That’s very likely.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. With so many tutors and military experts researching day and night, it’s only a matter of time before they can come up with a treatment,” Feng Qiuyan ended up consoling them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said to Feng Qiuyan, “I have something that could work, but it’s not guaranteed to be effective. It might end up completely useless. Do you want to give it a try?”</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan didn’t ask Zhou Wen what method he had and said, “Coach, feel free to try. It’s best if it works. It’s fine if it’s useless.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t stand on ceremony as he summoned Doctor Darkness. Then, he got Doctor Darkness to use Fight Poison With Poison to inject some poison into the mushrooms.</p>
<p>The mushrooms quickly withered and fell off automatically.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan waited for a while longer. Seeing that there weren’t any mushrooms growing on the wound on Feng Qiuyan’s face, they were overjoyed.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>An Tianzuo had arrived at Leng Zongzheng’s office. He was brewing tea for Leng Zongzheng while An Sheng stood silently to the side.</p>
<p>“Teacher, isn’t it a little too hasty for you to give Zhou Wen the Great Might Vajra Bull Companion Egg?” An Tianzuo held the teacup with both hands and said.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng said with a smile, “I’ve already seen some of his abilities. He should be able to control the Great Might Vajra Bull.”</p>
<p>“Teacher, you think too highly of him. Although he does have some talent and is quite lucky to have obtained some Mythical Companion Beasts, he’s still a student after all. His experience and mental state aren’t mature enough. He hasn’t experienced much, so I’m afraid he won’t be able to deal with sudden and unknown crises. Instead, he will be a burden on us,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“I remember that when you were his age, you had already led the Sunset Army to battle everywhere. You engaged in a slaughter in many dimensional zones, right? In that case, he’s not young anymore,” Leng Zongzheng said as he sipped his tea.</p>
<p>“How can that be the same? I was trained from a young age. I’ve experienced countless life-and-death situations, but he hasn’t experienced any setbacks. Relying on him for this matter is unreliable. Why don’t you reconsider?” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng smiled at An Tianzuo and said, “Are you afraid that he won’t do well, or are you afraid that he will be in danger?”</p>
<p>“Of course I’m afraid that he screws up and implicates us,” An Tianzuo immediately answered.</p>
<p>“So that’s how it is. Then, it’s fine. Even if he can’t help much, it’s not a problem for him to control the Great Might Vajra Bull. As for whether he will die in there or not, it doesn’t matter since you aren’t concerned,” Leng Zongzheng said with his eyes narrowed as he sipped his tea.</p>
<p>“Teacher, you should have heard that the empress dowager in my family dotes on him very much. If he were to die inside, I wouldn’t mind, but I’m afraid that the person back home wouldn’t agree to it. When that happens, not only will I have a headache, but you will also have a headache, right?” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“So that’s how it is.” Leng Zongzheng looked enlightened as he took a sip of tea and said, “However, I think Zhou Wen has quite a lot of combat experience. His adaptability isn’t bad either, and he has quite a number of Companion Beasts. With the Great Might Vajra Bull’s protection, there shouldn’t be much of a problem.”</p>
<p>An Tianzuo was about to say something when a soldier reported, “Overseer, there’s news from the research institute. The problem of the Parasite Spores has been resolved.”</p>
<p>An Tianzuo was overjoyed when he heard that. He got up and asked, “Excellent, that’s great. Which expert or tutor came up with the solution?”</p>
<p>Although the Parasite Spores were very weak, the effects they brought gave even An Tianzuo a headache. If they weren’t resolved in time, the Sunset Army and the college would suffer a heavy blow.</p>
<p>The soldier answered, “According to the news we received, a student’s Companion Beast can restrain the Parasite Spores. The unconscious soldiers who he helped have already woken up. The mushrooms automatically peel off and stop growing. Currently, the student is clearing out the Parasite Spores on the soldiers and tutors.”</p>
<p>“Student?” An Tianzuo frowned slightly.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng smiled and asked, “What’s the student’s name?”</p>
<p>“His name is Zhou Wen. He was the one who rushed into the dimensional creature horde yesterday to kill the golden bull,” the soldier immediately answered.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng turned his head to look at An Tianzuo and said, “What did I say? This Zhou Wen is still alright. He resolved a problem that so many people couldn’t. If you say he’s unsuitable, who else is more suitable?”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Doctor Darkness to remove the Parasite Spores on everyone. Doctor Darkness’s Fight Poison With Poison was indeed useful. As long as he injected it into the spores, the spores would quickly die and there wouldn’t be a relapse.</p>
<p>“Little Wen, well done.” Qin Wufu was the last to receive Zhou Wen’s treatment. He patted Zhou Wen’s shoulder and said, “Think about it again. Join me after graduation. You can name any conditions you want.”</p>
<p>“It’s still a long time before graduation. I haven’t considered these matters,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“It’s about time to consider it carefully. The situation in the various parts of the Federation isn’t too good right now. I wonder how many more years we can last,” Qin Wufu said with a sigh.</p>
<p>After busying himself for more than a day, he finally removed all the spores that had parasitized people. When Zhou Wen returned to the tent, he originally wanted to take out the Great Might Vajra Companion Egg and hatch it.</p>
<p>However, he realized that Tai Sui had completed its evolution. He hurriedly summoned it to see what changes it had.</p>
<h3 id='chapter674'>Chapter 674: Clashing Tai Sui</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Tai Sui was still fair and tender. From its size, it had slimmed down from what it had eaten previously and returned to its original appearance. It looked no different from when it was at the Mortal stage. Zhou Wen had no choice but to look at its information.</p>
<p>Tai Sui: Epic (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Clashing Tai Sui</p>
<p>Life Soul: Twelve Tai Sui Gods</p>
<p>Strength: 41</p>
<p>Speed: 41</p>
<p>Constitution: 41</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 41</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Earth Escape</p>
<p>Companion Form: Mimicry</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen finished reading the stats, his expression turned odd. People in the East District probably knew about the words ‘Clashing Tai Sui’. It meant that one was in for some unlucky times.</p>
<p>As for the Twelve Tai Sui Gods, Zhou Wen had never heard of them. He carefully looked at the information on the Life Providence and Life Soul.</p>
<p>Clashing Tai Sui: One’s characteristic clashes with Tai Sui</p>
<p>Twelve Tai Sui Gods: Zodiac Twelve Tai Sui Gods</p>
<p>Although he didn’t understand it clearly, Zhou Wen already felt that it was definitely not some lucky Life Providence. What good could come from having a characteristic clash with Tai Sui?</p>
<p>If I had known this would happen, I might not have let it evolve! Zhou Wen was somewhat speechless as he hurriedly put Tai Sui away. He was afraid that he would be in trouble if he were to clash with it. He might be in trouble in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss as to how to deal with Tai Sui. He really couldn’t bear to part with it by fusing it with something else. This was an existence that could advance to the Mythical stage in the future. What was even rarer was that this fellow was extremely effective against microscopic dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>When it was at the Mortal stage, it could kill the Mythical Primordial Spore. It was probably difficult to find another Companion Beast like that.</p>
<p>Let’s wait and see. If it really brings bad luck, I’ll think of a way to deal with it. After some thought, Zhou Wen decided to keep it for now.</p>
<p>After putting away Tai Sui, Zhou Wen carefully sized up the Great Might Vajra Bull Companion Egg. There were many mysterious magic circles and incantations on it. Furthermore, the magic circles and incantations emitted intense Essence Energy fluctuations. Clearly, someone had used a strange power to inject Essence Energy into the magic circle and incantations.</p>
<p>With the Essence Energy that was stored ahead of time, the difficulty of incubating it would decrease greatly. To be able to do something that amazing, it probably wasn’t done by the typical Epic stage expert.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen studied it for a long time, but he couldn’t figure out how the magic circles and incantations were produced. It was as though they had already entered deep into the Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Such an ingenious method is like a precious treasure to an ordinary Epic, but it’s useless for me. Even without the pre-injected Essence Energy, I can still incubate a Mythical Companion Egg. Zhou Wen tried injecting his Essence Energy to incubate the Great Might Vajra Bull.</p>
<p>The Essence Energy didn’t enter the Companion Egg directly. Instead, it circulated along the magic formation and incantations before entering the Companion Egg. Apart from the supplementary stored Essence Energy, it also slowed down the Essence Energy absorption speed of the Mythical Companion Egg.</p>
<p>The entire process was very smooth. Even an ordinary Epic could incubate it with the help of the magic circles and incantations.</p>
<p>I wonder if this technique is easy to learn. If I can learn it, it will be a good way to earn money. Many people will definitely be willing to pay to incubate high-level Companion Beasts. Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know that using this method was extremely difficult. There weren’t more than ten people in the entire Federation who could use such techniques. Furthermore, to carve the magic formation and incantations on it required expending a large number of precious resources.</p>
<p>Unless it was a Mythical Companion Egg, it wasn’t worth spending such a huge price on the hatching of a typical Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Back when An Sheng hatched Love Letter, he couldn’t bear to use this method. Instead, he found a dimensional zone with abundant Essence Energy and used the special Essence Energy environment, along with some Essence Energy Crystals and mystical techniques to incubate it.</p>
<p>Great Might Vajra Bull: Mythical</p>
<p>Life Providence: Extreme Might, Extreme Strength</p>
<p>Life Soul: Bull-Headed Wisdom King</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Soul Suppression Bell</p>
<p>Strength: 80</p>
<p>Speed: 78</p>
<p>Constitution: 80</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 80</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Great Might Divine Horns, Fury of Thunder, Infallible Vajra, Buddha Flames.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Mount</p>
<p>Its skills and attributes were very strong, and it had four skills. They looked pretty good. It had all the abilities it should have. The golden bell was the Great Might Vajra Bull’s Wheel of Destiny, which was also the skill that Zhou Wen valued the most.</p>
<p>However, what’s with it being a mount? This was the first time Zhou Wen had seen one. He imagined that a Companion Beast in companion form would be a mount—no different from the typical Companion Beast form.</p>
<p>I’ll give it a try. Let’s see how different this mount is from simply riding it. Zhou Wen took out his phone and entered the game dungeon before summoning the Great Might Vajra Bull.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen realized that the Great Might Vajra Bull in its mount form was indeed different. When Zhou Wen rode the Six-Winged, he needed to command it.</p>
<p>However, the Great Might Vajra Bull in its mount form didn’t need Zhou Wen’s commanding. It was as though it had become Zhou Wen’s limb. It could move according to his wishes. The only difference was that the Great Might Vajra Bull didn’t grow on him.</p>
<p>Professional mounts are indeed different. Zhou Wen finally understood what the ancients meant by human and horse as one.</p>
<p>Now, his riding skills—human and bull as one—was pretty good. At the very least, it was much more comfortable than riding Six-Winged.</p>
<p>If there was any weakness of the Great Might Vajra Bull to point out, it would be its inability to fly. It was indeed extremely powerful on the ground, but it couldn’t fly or go into water.</p>
<p>However, it doesn’t matter. In any case, the skill I need the most is the Great Might Vajra Bull’s Soul Suppression Bell. The other skills are secondary. Zhou Wen took the Great Might Vajra Bull to the Qiongqi temple. The moment Qiongqi appeared, the Great Might Vajra Bull used the Soul Suppression Bell, causing Qiongqi to feel dizzy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Golden Overlord Sword cleaved down, severely injuring Qiongqi with his sword. Following that, it was a one-sided slaughter. Soon, Qiongqi fell under his sword.</p>
<p>Awesome. That’s what a real man is. A cowboy! Zhou Wen felt extremely delighted. Killing monsters in such a manner was much easier than charging forward on his own.</p>
<p>Since he had nothing to do, Zhou Wen summoned the Primordial Spore to see how useful it was.</p>
<p>As the stats of the Primordial Spore were too poor, Zhou Wen didn’t dare use it against Mythical creatures. Instead, he went to the bat cave to test it out.</p>
<p>The Primordial Spore slowly floated towards the ceiling of the cave. The poisonous bats hanging upside down didn’t realize the impending danger.</p>
<p>They didn’t have the ability to discover a tiny existence like the Primordial Spore, so they had no idea that the danger was near them.</p>
<p>The Primordial Spore landed on the head of a Poison Bat. The Poison Bat didn’t even realize its existence as the Primordial Spore vanished in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that the Primordial Spore would grow a tiny mushroom over the Poison Bat’s head like ordinary spores, but nothing like that happened. The Poison Bat suddenly opened its eyes, but the look in its eyes turned odd as it flapped its wings and moved towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter675'>Chapter 675: Soul Parasitizing</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Could it be… Zhou Wen was delighted when he saw the Poison Bat fly over.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Poison Bat flew in front of Zhou Wen and circled him. Zhou Wen could sense the thoughts of Primordial Spore in the Poison Bat’s brain.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen issued an order to Primordial Spore. The Poison Bat flew up according to Zhou Wen’s orders before charging at the group of Poison Bats and engaging the other Poison Bats in battle.</p>
<p>The other Poison Bats were still somewhat puzzled, unsure what had happened. A few of them had been killed by the Poison Bat controlled by Primordial Spore before it was killed by the other Poison Bats.</p>
<p>After the Poison Bat died, the Primordial Spore floated out and slowly returned to Zhou Wen’s side.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed when he saw this, but he was pleasantly surprised. Is this Soul Parasitizing? This fellow can actually control other dimensional creatures through parasitizing. Then, can it control Mythical creatures?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t wait to give it a try. He went to the Torch Dragon temple, hoping to see if he could get Primordial Spore to control Torch Dragon.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Torch Dragon had great eyesight. It immediately discovered the Primordial Spore and didn’t give it a chance. It directly used the Bright Torch Vision World and sucked Primordial Spore into the Vision World.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it’s still a little difficult to parasitize Torch Dragon. I’ll try someone with poorer eyesight. Zhou Wen went to the Metalwork Temple to see if he could parasitize the Golden Battle God Halberd, but it didn’t have any effect.</p>
<p>The Primordial Spore was unable to penetrate Golden Battle God Halberd’s body. Although it was not killed by Golden Battle God Halberd, it failed to parasitize it successfully.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Primordial Spore can only parasitize animals or plant-type dimensional creatures. Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he took it to the underground sea to test it out with the nine black dragons.</p>
<p>Primordial Spore successfully entered a black dragon’s body, but the black dragon was clearly formidable. Primordial Spore was unable to control it given the short period of time. It only rooted itself in the black dragon’s head, and it was unknown when it would completely gain control.</p>
<p>From the feedback from Primordial Spore, it was not a matter of a few days.</p>
<p>Primordial Spore’s powers are pretty good, but it takes too long to control Mythical creatures. It’s not very useful in-game. Zhou Wen had to respawn dungeons every day, so it was impossible for him to use Primordial Spore to slowly parasitize creatures.</p>
<p>Although it’s not very useful in-game, if I can get Primordial Spore to parasitize a powerful dimensional creature in real life, wouldn’t I have an extremely powerful fighter… Who should I parasitize? There are already many terrifying dimensional creatures in Dragon Gate Grotto. Why don’t I find an opportunity here… Zhou Wen thought to himself as he planned how to use Primordial Spore to maximize his benefits.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Over the next few days, many strange dimensional creatures rushed out of Dragon Gate Grotto. Although many dimensional creatures were ferocious, the damage they caused wasn’t as great as the Parasite Spores.</p>
<p>Sometimes, powerful dimensional creatures were not as terrifying as the weak spores.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen had treated almost every soldier and officer, the soldiers and officers were very respectful to him when he delivered the supplies.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan had also gained the respect of the soldiers and officers because of their achievements in the previous battle.</p>
<p>Although the dimensional creatures that rushed out of Dragon Gate Grotto were destroyed, the situation didn’t improve. The golden robes of the skeleton in the mountain temple became even more resplendent. Even in the dark night, it illuminated the entire Dragon Gate Grotto.</p>
<p>The river beside Dragon Gate Grotto hadn’t been peaceful for the past few days. The temperature of the river was extremely high. In the beginning, it only emitted white steam, but it had begun boiling over the past two days.</p>
<p>The fish and shrimps inside died and floated to the surface of the river.</p>
<p>No one dared to fish up the shrimps. In the end, they fell apart from the river’s boiling and sank.</p>
<p>“What’s the origins of the monk-robed skeleton in the mountain seal? Do you think the anomaly in Dragon Gate Grotto is because of the monk-robed skeleton?” After Li Xuan and Zhou Wen finished transporting the supplies, they stood by the river’s defense line and looked at Dragon Gate Grotto. All they could see was golden light enveloping it. And the source of the golden light was the monk-robed skeleton.</p>
<p>“That’s possible.” Zhou Wen also felt that it was possible.</p>
<p>However, up to now, no one could clearly tell the source of Dragon Gate Grotto’s anomaly.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng hadn’t looked for Zhou Wen since his private conversation with him. Therefore Zhou Wen wasn’t kept abreast of the situation.</p>
<p>There was one thing that Zhou Wen was more concerned about. For so many days, the giant golden bird that had lived above Dragon Gate Grotto hadn’t revealed itself. It was unknown what it was waiting for.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>As the two of them were watching Dragon Gate Grotto, a terrifying sound suddenly came from the other side of the river bank. The ground seemed to quake with the sound.</p>
<p>The river also produced ripples due to the shock. The ripples pushed forward ripple by ripple before finally creating a wave.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan looked in the direction of the sound. Under the moonlight, they saw a gigantic white elephant walking along the river bank. It was likely heading to Dragon Gate Grotto based on the direction it was traveling.</p>
<p>“What a huge white elephant. Where did this fellow come from?” Li Xuan asked in surprise.</p>
<p>The white elephant was indeed massive. An ordinary elephant probably didn’t even reach its knees. Not only was its body huge, but it also emitted a strange glow as though it was bathed in holy light.</p>
<p>Its pair of tusks were pure and white as if they were made of jade.</p>
<p>The gigantic white elephant walked over step by step. Every step it took made a huge print in the ground, causing the ground to tremble. The houses in the encampment seemed to sway with every step.</p>
<p>The white elephant was clearly not a dimensional creature from Dragon Gate Grotto. It walked to the opposite side of Dragon Gate Grotto and directly entered the river. It looked like it wanted to cross the river and enter Dragon Gate Grotto.</p>
<p>The river was boiling and the temperature was extremely high. However, the white elephant didn’t seem to notice it. The moment it stepped in, the river overflowed.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng, An Tianzuo, Qin Wufu, and company had already come out. They were also watching the white elephant.</p>
<p>The soldiers guarding the front line couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief when they saw that the white elephant wasn’t heading towards the encampment. The pressure the white elephant gave them was just too strong.</p>
<p>The elephant parted the river’s water; its might left one shuddering.</p>
<p>Just as the elephant was about to reach the center of the river, a hook-like black claw suddenly reached out from the river.</p>
<h3 id='chapter676'>Chapter 676: Monk-Robed Skeleton</h3>
<p>The white elephant didn’t seem to notice the black claw as it continued walking forward. However, when the black claw touched its body, white smoke emitted.</p>
<p>As if charcoal had encountered water, the black claw retreated back into the river.</p>
<p>The huge white elephant continued walking towards Dragon Gate Grotto as though nothing had happened. It was as though it only had one goal in its eyes.</p>
<p>The black claw never appeared again even when the white elephant stepped onto the river bank.</p>
<p>When it tore out of the water and got ashore, the water droplets on his body automatically slid off, leaving nothing behind.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company watched helplessly as the white elephant walked towards Dragon Gate Grotto and headed for the mountain temple.</p>
<p>Li Xuan looked at where An Tianzuo and company were. Seeing that they were only standing high above and watching without giving any orders, he turned back to look at the white elephant.</p>
<p>The white elephant walked on the mountain rocks. Wherever the giant foot passed, the rocks cracked, leaving behind huge footprints.</p>
<p>The dimensional creatures in Dragon Gate Grotto didn’t dare approach the white elephant. All of them hid in the cave and trembled, not daring to walk out of the cave.</p>
<p>The huge white elephant walked all the way to the temple before stopping to look at the monk-robed skeleton that emitted a resplendent golden light. It raised its trunk and let out an elephant’s trumpet.</p>
<p>“Not good! Quickly cover your ears!” Zhou Wen shouted at Li Xuan.</p>
<p>However, it was already a little too late. Everyone felt a thunderclap in their ears, causing their minds to buzz. The soldiers with weaker cultivation levels fell to the ground. Even Epic officers saw stars.</p>
<p>“Help… Help me up… Why do I feel like I’m in front of gold ingots…” Li Xuan seemed drunk as his body swayed violently.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was fine as he hurriedly held him up.</p>
<p>After a while, Li Xuan, the Epic officers, and tutors came to their senses. As for the soldiers, they were still lying on the ground, unable to stand up as though they were drunk.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen looked at the temple, he saw that the white elephant had already stepped into it.</p>
<p>The moment it stepped into the temple, the golden light on the monk-clothed skeleton suddenly flared up brightly like the sun. The golden light shone on the white elephant’s body, causing it to falter.</p>
<p>The white elephant paused for a moment, but it quickly walked towards the monk-robed skeleton again. Under the suppression of the terrifying golden light, it found it extremely difficult to take a step forward.</p>
<p>However, it had no intention of giving up. It continued walking towards the monk-robed skeleton. The closer it was to the skeleton, the slower its speed became.</p>
<p>When it was only a few steps away from the skeleton, it took each step like it was carrying a mountain.</p>
<p>Finally, the white elephant walked in front of the monk-robed skeleton. Just as Zhou Wen was guessing what it was about to do, it raised its trunk and swept it at the monk-robed skeleton as though it was a huge pillar that emitted terrifying holy light.</p>
<p>“It wants to destroy the monk’s remains?” Li Xuan said in surprise.</p>
<p>Just as he said that, the white elephant’s trunk slammed into the monk-robed skeleton. However, the monk-robed skeleton wasn’t smashed to bits. It continued sitting there cross-legged.</p>
<p>It suddenly raised its bony hand and grabbed the white elephant’s trunk.</p>
<p>In the next moment, everyone saw an unbelievable scene. With a wave of the skeleton’s hand, the gigantic elephant’s body was easily thrown away.</p>
<p>Under Zhou Wen and company’s horrified gazes, the massive elephant fell into the river beneath Dragon Gate Grotto.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Water splashed up hundreds of feet high as the huge elephant’s body smashed into the river, creating a huge crater at the bottom. Instantly, the water level around the river bank increased drastically, almost reaching the encampment.</p>
<p>“That monk-robed skeleton is alive? Did he throw the terrifying elephant flying with one hand? What kind of crazy strength is that?” Li Xuan exclaimed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed and uncertain. It could fling such a massive and powerful white elephant easily. Such immense strength was probably something only Tyrant Behemoth could achieve when it used Absolute Strength.</p>
<p>However, no matter how Zhou Wen looked at it, the monk-robed skeleton didn’t look like it had powers like Absolute Strength.</p>
<p>What’s his background? Why is the white elephant attacking him? Zhou Wen sized up the monk-robed skeleton in surprise.</p>
<p>The skeleton was crystalline and it emitted an intense golden glow, like a Buddha’s golden body.</p>
<p>Although the monk robe was tattered, it couldn’t conceal the Buddhist light.</p>
<p>He sat in a lotus position with a stone door behind him. There were no words or patterns on the door, and behind it was an extremely simple squarish stone house.</p>
<p>The stone house was less than two meters tall, and the stone door was even shorter. The monk-robed skeleton was sitting in front of the door which was only twenty to thirty centimeters taller than him. A normal adult would probably have to bend to enter.</p>
<p>Could it be that there’s something strange in the stone house behind the monk-robed skeleton? Zhou Wen was guessing when he heard a tumultuous sound.</p>
<p>Turning his head, he saw the white elephant fighting a similarly gigantic black creature in the river. As the river water churned, Zhou Wen finally saw what the black object was.</p>
<p>“What a huge turtle! Such a huge turtle must have lived for hundreds of thousands of years. Killing it to make a stew will definitely be nutritious,” Li Xuan exclaimed with widened eyes.</p>
<p>The black creature was actually a huge turtle. It was pitch-black and its shell was like black iron. Its body wasn’t much smaller than the white elephant.</p>
<p>It fought the white elephant in the river and bit its neck, refusing to let go. The white elephant couldn’t shake it off no matter how hard it tried. Its holy flesh and blood couldn’t defend it from the turtle’s teeth. Blood gushed out from the bite, dyeing the river red.</p>
<p>Terrifying power constantly erupted from the elephant’s body, but it couldn’t do anything to the huge turtle. The turtle’s shell was just too hard. Even with the elephant’s strength, it couldn’t smash it open.</p>
<p>The holy light on the white elephant’s body grew dimmer. Just as the huge turtle was about to kill it in the river, a bird’s cry suddenly resounded.</p>
<p>A golden light descended from the sky. It was the giant golden bird.</p>
<p>It tore through the air like a bolt of lightning as its pair of talons grabbed at the tortoise’s turtle shell. It managed to penetrate the black iron-like turtle shell. The pain made the turtle release its grip.</p>
<p>However, the golden bird didn’t stop. It flapped its wings and lifted the huge turtle high into the sky. It brandished its sharp claws and tore it to pieces in the blink of an eye. Blood splattered across the sky.</p>
<p>The people in the encampment were dumbfounded. The golden bird was so ferocious that it left them terrified.</p>
<p>This giant bird’s strength is probably comparable to Tyrant Behemoth! Zhou Wen was also alarmed. Only now did he realize how impressive Leng Zongzheng’s feat of getting the giant golden bird to retreat was.</p>
<h3 id='chapter677'>Chapter 677: The Tragic Death of a Mythical</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The turtle shell was extremely hard, but it couldn’t withstand the golden bird’s sharp claws at all. In a moment, it was torn to pieces. The golden bird then ate it in midair, killing it in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>How horrid. To think I actually fought it before. It’s really lucky that I didn’t die. Zhou Wen was secretly alarmed. Back then, he wasn’t as strong as he was now.</p>
<p>Of course, that wasn’t a real battle. The golden bird’s target wasn’t him, or Zhou Wen wouldn’t have been able to escape so easily.</p>
<p>When the huge turtle was killed by the golden bird, the white elephant finally crawled out of the river. The wounds on its body rapidly healed.</p>
<p>The strength of the huge white elephant was originally above the huge turtle’s, but it had been thrown out by the monk-clothed skeleton, rendering it completely defenseless. This produced an opening for the huge turtle to take advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>The golden bird tore and ate up the turtle, but it had no intention of touching the elephant. It flapped its wings and shot straight into the clouds like a bolt of golden lightning, disappearing behind the mountain peak.</p>
<p>After the wounds on the elephant’s body healed, it charged towards the monk-robed skeleton in the temple again. Its holy light surged crazily, but it was barely able to reach the skeleton.</p>
<p>As it had been severely injured, it didn’t even have the ability to attack the monk-robed skeleton.</p>
<p>After persisting for a long period of time, the strength of the elephant slowly dwindled from the clash with the golden light. Finally, it couldn’t withstand the impact of the golden light as its massive body appeared to be struck by rapids. It rolled down Dragon Gate Grotto and fell into the river, triggering a huge wave.</p>
<p>“That monk-robed skeleton is really too powerful,” Li Xuan exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Did you see the object that the skeleton seems to be holding in its hand?” Zhou Wen had been observing the skeleton.</p>
<p>He had managed to throw the white elephant away with one hand, but his other hand never moved. It had always been covered by the monk robes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that there seemed to be an abnormal bulge. Unfortunately, Truth Listener’s ability was affected by the golden light. He couldn’t tell what was happening around the monk-robed skeleton, or he would have known if there was anything in his hand.</p>
<p>Li Xuan used his Life Soul’s insect eyes to look, but he only saw something vague. He couldn’t tell what it was either.</p>
<p>“Do you think the white elephant is so desperate for the item in his hand?” Li Xuan guessed.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure yet. Let’s wait and see.” Zhou Wen saw the white elephant crawl out again as it panted by the riverside. However, it was unwilling to give up. After resting for a while, it charged towards the monk-robed skeleton for the third time.</p>
<p>Li Xuan said to Zhou Wen, “If the elephant falls again, it will have even weaker stamina. I wonder if we can take advantage of it?”</p>
<p>“I’m just afraid that the golden bird and the white elephant are in cahoots. You’ve seen the outcome of that huge turtle. If you aren’t afraid of death, give it a try.” Zhou Wen definitely wouldn’t give it a try.</p>
<p>He wouldn’t even try it with his pets. After all, each of his Mythical pets had been obtained with great difficulty. Every one of them was obtained through blood and tears. Every death made his heart ache.</p>
<p>“That makes sense. That golden bird is too terrifying. It’s probably an existence that can match Primordial Sword Immortal and Tyrant Behemoth. From its abilities, it seems to be focused on speed and offensive strength. Could it be the legendary Golden-Winged Roc?” Li Xuan guessed.</p>
<p>“That’s very likely.” Zhou Wen also felt that the golden bird resembled the legendary Golden-Winged Roc.</p>
<p>As the two of them spoke, the white elephant rushed into the temple again and trudged towards the monk-robed skeleton.</p>
<p>This time, the white elephant was different from before. Its tusks lit up like two bright lamps. It resisted the golden light, making it rush towards the monk-robed skeleton in a seemingly easier manner than the first two times.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen realized that the elephant’s tusks were constantly burning. Its strength seemed to be exchanged from burning the tusks.</p>
<p>Finally, the huge white elephant charged in front of the monk-robed skeleton with the brilliance produced by burning the tusks. It lowered its head and used its burning tusks to slam into the monk-robed skeleton.</p>
<p>Before the tusks reached the monk, the force produced by thrust blew at the monk robes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been paying constant attention to the monk-robed skeleton. When the monk robe fluttered, he saw that the other skeleton hand was placed above his thigh bone.</p>
<p>In that hand was a golden crystal that was about the size of a chicken egg. It looked slightly oval.</p>
<p>The moment the crystal appeared, it immediately emitted a golden glow that illuminated the entire mountain temple. Nothing could be seen.</p>
<p>Even with Zhou Wen and Li Xuan’s eyesight, they couldn’t see anything.</p>
<p>After a while, the golden light vanished. When everyone saw the scene inside the temple again, they widened their eyes in horror.</p>
<p>The white elephant was still in front of the monk-robed skeleton. It hadn’t been thrown down this time, but its flesh and organs had completely vanished. All that was left was a skeleton standing in front of the monk-robed skeleton, maintaining the posture of lowering its head to strike. It was the last scene Zhou Wen and company had seen.</p>
<p>A gust of wind blew and the huge skeleton suddenly scattered like flour. It landed on the ground and covered the entire mountain temple.</p>
<p>Everyone felt a chill run down their spines as they broke out in cold sweat.</p>
<p>In the middle of the afternoon, everyone felt their bodies turn cold.</p>
<p>“What was that bead just now?” Li Xuan stared at the monk-robed skeleton in the temple. The monk robe fell again, covering the bead. They couldn’t see anything anymore.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but there’s a Companion Egg on the ground,” Zhou Wen said as he pointed towards the temple.</p>
<p>In the pile of bone powder, there was a white Companion Egg. It was about half as tall as a person. It was clearly left behind by the white elephant after its death.</p>
<p>“The white elephant’s Companion Egg is good stuff, but who would dare enter to take it?” Although Li Xuan’s self-healing ability was very strong, he wasn’t so foolhardy to believe that he could withstand the terrifying golden light.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had some ideas. Although the elephant wasn’t a top-notch Mythical creature, it was still a Mythical creature.</p>
<p>I wonder if I can send an Epic Companion Beast in and get it out? Just as Zhou Wen had this thought, someone had already done so.</p>
<p>Among the Epic experts sent by the local major families in Luoyang, an Epic expert summoned an Epic immortal crane. It flew into the temple, hoping to get the Companion Egg out.</p>
<p>However, just as the immortal crane flew into the mountain temple, its body came into contact with the golden light emitted by the monk-robed skeleton. It immediately disintegrated and died.</p>
<p>Everyone was alarmed. Only then did they realize that not anyone could enter the mountain temple. The white elephant could travel against the golden light in the mountain temple, but that didn’t mean they could do the same.</p>
<p>“Thankfully, I didn’t enter.” Li Xuan broke out into a cold sweat. He had really wanted to rush into the temple to retrieve the white elephant’s Companion Egg.</p>
<h3 id='chapter678'>Chapter 678: Determining Its Attributes</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>No one dared to act rashly. They just watched.</p>
<p>Everyone wanted the white elephant Companion Egg, but no one dared to send a Companion Beast into the mountain temple. The death of the Epic immortal crane was truly shocking.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen felt that his Mythical Companion Beast was likely capable of withstanding the golden light emitted by the monk-robed skeleton, he was afraid that the golden light from the crystal would erupt again. When that happened, even a Mythical might not be able to withstand it. To sacrifice a Mythical Companion Beast for a Mythical Companion Egg, with the possibility of not getting it back made it too risky.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo and Leng Zongzheng didn’t let their Companion Beasts enter the mountain temple. Clearly, they had the same qualms.</p>
<p>Two Mythical creatures had died. No one dared to enter the temple to grab the Companion Eggs. There were no new changes in Dragon Gate Grotto.</p>
<p>Qin Wufu had already ordered the troops to disperse and rest. The soldiers and officers returned to their respective positions. As for the Epic experts from the noble families, they sized up the Companion Egg unwillingly and tried to think of ways to get it out.</p>
<p>In the end, they lost several Epic Companion Beasts and failed to enter the mountain temple.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ultimately held back his urges and didn’t let his Mythical Companion Beast enter. Before figuring out the origins of the monk-clothed skeleton and the crystal, taking risks meant death.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, Chancellor Leng wants to see you,” An Sheng said as Zhou Wen was loading the supplies.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen put down his work and followed An Sheng to Leng Zongzheng’s office.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen arrived, he realized that An Tianzuo and Qin Wufu were there. Zhou Wen pretended not to see An Tianzuo and only greeted Chancellor Leng and Qin Wufu.</p>
<p>“Little Zhou, come and have a seat.” Qin Wufu warmly invited Zhou Wen to take a seat.</p>
<p>Only then did Leng Zongzheng say, “You all saw what happened in the mountain temple. What are your thoughts?”</p>
<p>Qin Wufu said, “Chancellor, do you think the golden crystal in the skeleton’s hand is the legendary Relic?”</p>
<p>“There’s a possibility, but Relics are Buddhist treasures. Logically speaking, they shouldn’t have such destructive force,” said Leng Zongzheng.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo thought for a moment and said, “I do have an idea. Perhaps that monk-robed skeleton isn’t a dimensional creature from Dragon Gate Grotto.”</p>
<p>“Go into the detail.” Leng Zongzheng gestured for An Tianzuo to continue.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo continued, “When we saw him sitting cross-legged in his monk robes, we thought he was a dimensional creature from Dragon Gate Grotto. However, the power he used, including the crystal, looks different from the Buddhist-type creatures I’ve seen before.”</p>
<p>“That’s right.” Leng Zongzheng nodded calmly.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo added, “From my point of view, he’s the same as the white elephant and the golden bird. They are all eyeing the things inside Dragon Gate Grotto’s mountain temple. However, he entered rather early, so he occupied the spot. The white elephant’s target isn’t him, but the stone house behind him. In conclusion, the thing that caused Dragon Gate Grotto to mutate might very well be inside that stone house.”</p>
<p>“Tianzuo’s guess coincides with mine. The golden-winged bird and the monk-robed skeleton are top Mythical creatures. If we want to achieve anything, I’m afraid we won’t be able to avoid competing with them. We need to make early preparations.” After Leng Zongzheng said that, he looked at Zhou Wen and said, “When the time comes, you can enter the mountain temple with us. You have to be prepared to fight the golden-winged bird and the monk-robed skeleton. If you have any worries, tell me ahead of time.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll prepare well,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng nodded and continued, “Let’s say that the monk-robed skeleton isn’t a dimensional creature from Dragon Gate Grotto, nor is he a Buddhist-tye creature. Which type do you think it is?”</p>
<p>Qin Wufu pondered and said, “I’ve seen quite a number of dimensional creatures over the years, but this is the first time I’ve seen such power.”</p>
<p>Seeing Leng Zongzheng look at him, An Tianzuo shook his head and said, “I’ve never seen it before.”</p>
<p>Seeing that everyone was unsure of the skeleton’s strength, Leng Zongzheng said, “Since that’s the case, let’s start from judging the skeleton’s Strength stat.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen listened to their discussion from the side and didn’t say a word. After all, he was still too young. The dimensional zones and dimensional creatures he had come into contact with were limited. His experience couldn’t compare to the few people present, so all he could do was listen to their discussion. It would also broaden his knowledge.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng and company planned on using the most primitive and most effective method to probe what kind of dimensional creature the monk-robed skeleton was.</p>
<p>The method was very simple. It was to use the principle of attribute strengths and weaknesses. They would send Companion Beasts of similar strength but of different types into the mountain temple.</p>
<p>Then, they could observe the reactions after being attacked by the golden light in the mountain temple. If they were strong or weak against it, they would definitely have different reactions. They might die quickly or last a little longer.</p>
<p>By using these minute differences, one could roughly deduce the monk-clothed skeleton’s type.</p>
<p>Of course, this method had a premise. Among the Companion Beasts used for testing, there had to be existences that were strong or weak against the monk-robed skeleton or they would be useless.</p>
<p>After the discussion ended, An Sheng was in charge of the probe. Zhou Wen didn’t receive any assigned missions as he continued his preparations.</p>
<p>The test didn’t go smoothly. An Sheng used nineteen different Legendary Companion Beasts to test, but he didn’t find anything abnormal.</p>
<p>Finally, he felt that it was likely that a Legendary Companion Beast was too weak. Even if it was strong or weak against it, it was difficult to show it. They had to use Epic Companion Beasts in the second round of testing.</p>
<p>The results of the second round of tests were the same. Despite sacrificing more than ten Epic Companion Beasts, they still failed to figure out the attributes of the monk-robed skeleton.</p>
<p>The only thing they could confirm was that the monk-robed skeleton wasn’t a Buddhist-type.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept thinking about how he could safely get the white elephant Companion Egg out, so he was also studying the attributes of the monk-robed skeleton.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there wasn’t an anomaly in Dragon Gate Grotto in-game, nor was there a mountain temple or monk-robed skeleton. There was no way to test it in-game.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen had an idea.</p>
<p>Primordial Spore’s Life Providence was Eternal Immortality. Although its stats weren’t high, it wasn’t easy to kill it.</p>
<p>Even the Golden Overlord Sword’s golden sword beam, which had the augmentation of Ever-Victorious and Unstoppable, couldn’t kill Primordial Spore. This showed how powerful the Eternal Immortality Life Providence was.</p>
<p>At present, Zhou Wen only knew that there were two types of skills that could directly kill Primordial Spore—Bright Torch Vision World and Tai Sui’s innate talent.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen thought of letting Primordial Spore enter the temple to give it a try. Perhaps he might discover something.</p>
<p>Having made up his mind, Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate any further. He released Primordial Spore and allowed it to float slowly towards the mountain temple.</p>
<h3 id='chapter679'>Chapter 679: It’s Here for Me</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Primordial Spore slowly floated over the river and headed for the mountain temple.</p>
<p>Although there were many Fairies and Mallas wandering around, none of them noticed the existence of Primordial Spore.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that using Primordial Spore to scout the way was extremely effective. Few dimensional creatures could discover its existence.</p>
<p>Primordial Spore made its way to the temple without any obstructions. However, the moment Primordial Spore entered the temple, something went wrong.</p>
<p>Although Primordial Spore wasn’t killed by the golden light that enveloped the entire mountain temple, its body emitted a blinding light when it clashed with the golden light. It was like a firefly’s glow.</p>
<p>Although the light wasn’t eye-catching, it made Primordial Spore lose the advantage of being virtually invisible.</p>
<p>Primordial Spore flew through the golden light and soon arrived beside the white elephant Companion Egg. As it had the Eternal Immortality Life Providence, it wasn’t killed by the golden light.</p>
<p>Having been exposed, it was too risky to let Primordial Spore fly towards the monk-robed skeleton. Under such circumstances, Zhou Wen wasn’t greedy. He got Primordial Spore to land on the white elephant’s Companion Egg before getting it to push the Companion Egg. He wanted to see if he could push the Companion Egg out of the temple.</p>
<p>Primordial Spore’s Strength was very weak, but that was when compared to other Mythical creatures. At the very least, it had 41 Strength. It was more than enough to push the white elephant’s Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was only a little worried. He didn’t know if the monk-robed skeleton would interfere.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen constantly observed the monk-robed skeleton’s movements. As long as he made any abnormal movements, Zhou Wen would immediately get Primordial Spore to escape and leave the Companion Egg behind.</p>
<p>However, the monk-robed skeleton didn’t react. Primordial Spore stuck to the white elephant Companion Egg, pushing it and making it slowly roll out of the temple.</p>
<p>The soldiers monitoring the mountain temple discovered the phenomenon of the white elephant Companion Egg and immediately reported it to their superiors. Soon, An Tianzuo, Qin Wufu, and company came out. Indeed, they saw the white elephant Companion Egg roll out of the mountain temple.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? Why is the Companion Egg rolling out?” Qin Wufu said in surprise as he held a pair of binoculars.</p>
<p>This was because after leaving the mountain temple, Primordial Spore no longer produced any light from resisting the golden light. Qin Wufu and company couldn’t see Primordial Spore at all.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo was also somewhat puzzled as he ordered the soldiers, “Be on high alert to prevent any incidents.”</p>
<p>After issuing the order, An Tianzuo carefully observed the Companion Egg, but he couldn’t figure it out. It was as though the Companion Egg had gained sentience and was rolling down the mountain.</p>
<p>The tutors and Epic experts from the rich and powerful families were also attracted over. Although they all wanted the white elephant Companion Egg, they found it odd to see it roll out. No one dared to snatch it.</p>
<p>“It’s coming… It’s coming to the encampment…” Someone realized that after the Companion Egg rolled down, it jumped into the river and leisurely crossed the river. It then rolled up to the river bank and rolled towards the encampment.</p>
<p>“Everyone, be careful…” A group of soldiers, tutors, and Epic experts were all waiting solemnly. They stared at the Companion Egg as though they were facing a great enemy. An Tianzuo and Leng Zongzheng were also staring at it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only wanted to get the Companion Egg out, having never expected to cause such a grand lineup. It didn’t seem right to take the Companion Egg in front of everyone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still hesitating about what to do when the Companion Egg rolled to the encampment. The soldiers aimed their guns at it, as though they would shoot at it with everything they had once the order was given.</p>
<p>The Epic experts had also summoned their Companion Beasts. It looked like they were preparing for battle.</p>
<p>“That… I’m sorry… It’s fine, it’s fine… Don’t worry… It’s here for me…” Zhou Wen had no choice but to bite the bullet and walk out. He raised his hands and waved at the soldiers, gesturing for them not to shoot.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Everyone was taken aback when they heard him say that. An Tianzuo’s expression was even stranger.</p>
<p>“What do you mean it’s here to look for you?” An Tianzuo and company found it odd. A Companion Egg came down from the mountain temple to find Zhou Wen?</p>
<p>Could it be that it had rested in the temple for too long and wanted to come down the mountain to chat with Zhou Wen? Wasn’t that ridiculous?</p>
<p>Everyone stared at Zhou Wen with odd expressions. The soldiers didn’t lower their guns. The Epic experts’ Companion Beasts were still staring at the Companion Egg. Clearly, they couldn’t believe Zhou Wen’s words.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to bite the bullet and wave at the Companion Egg. He said, “It’s fine. I’ll take it now. Everyone, you may return to your work.”</p>
<p>Everyone was alarmed when they saw the Companion Egg roll towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Could it be that something like a Companion Egg would find someone they knew? Many people had mixed expressions.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carried the Companion Egg and walked back. At that moment, An Tianzuo waved his hand, gesturing for the soldiers to return to their positions before they lowered their guns.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, Young Master Wen has quite good social relations. Even a Companion Egg delivers itself to him,” An Sheng said with a smile.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>An Tianzuo said with a cold expression, “It’s just a lowly trick.”</p>
<p>With that said, he ignored everyone and returned to his office.</p>
<p>“This Little Zhou is getting more and more interesting.” Leng Zongzheng looked at Zhou Wen with a smile before turning to leave.</p>
<p>The news of Companion Eggs coming down the mountain to chat with Zhou Wen immediately spread in the encampment. The more it spread, the crazier it became.</p>
<p>“You might not know about this. It was a cold, windy day. Countless heroes used all kinds of Companion Beasts, but none of them were able to extract the Companion Egg from the mountain temple. It could be said that there were countless deaths and injuries. However, who would have expected that the Companion Egg of the huge white elephant couldn’t withstand the loneliness in the middle of the dark, windy night? It went down the mountain to chat with Young Master Zhou… Speaking of Young Master Zhou, he’s no ordinary person. At Chess Mountain’s encampment, he is known as Doctor Little Zhou. He healed the strange ailment of the Chess Mountain. Now, at Dragon Gate Grotto’s encampment, he showed his might and wiped out the mushroom monsters that left many helpless…” A soldier, who had seen Zhou Wen while being stationed at Chess Mountain, explained to his colleagues who had missed the development because they were resting.</p>
<p>“Do you know why Young Master Zhou Wen has so many magical abilities? To be honest, my third uncle’s niece’s second aunt’s cousin-in-law is the gardener of the An family. According to his reliable sources, Young Master Wen is Madam Lan’s son, the Overseer’s younger brother. If you ask me why Young Master Wen’s surname is Zhou and not An, then we will have to talk about a tragic past. You might not believe it, but the Overseer and Young Master Wen are twins. Back when Madam Lan was giving birth, a great enemy attacked. After Madam Lan gave birth to the Overseer and Young Master Wen, Young Master Wen was snatched away by the bad guys…”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Ordinary soldiers didn’t know about the An family and the Zhou family. However, when they heard that Zhou Wen was Madam Lan’s son, and after making some additional associations, the rumors became crazier and crazier.</p>
<p>When the rumors reached An Tianzuo’s ears, the corners of his eyes twitched for a long time, but he remained silent.</p>
<p>An Sheng didn’t dare say a word as he stood at the side with a solemn expression. His face was taut, but for some reason, he looked very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“Old Zhou, how did you do it?” Li Xuan widened his eyes as he looked at the Companion Egg that Zhou Wen had carried back.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan had also seen the Companion Egg come down the mountain to look for Zhou Wen. After some thought, he came to a realization. “Coach, you must be proficient in the language of eggs. You can communicate with the Companion Egg, right?”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was instantly rendered speechless. All he could do was explain, “I used a microscopic Companion Beast to push the Companion Egg down. I know nothing about egg language.”</p>
<p>“I see.” Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan were immediately enlightened.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took some time to look at the stats of the huge white elephant’s Companion Egg and realized that its stats were rather good.</p>

<p>Constitution: 79</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 80</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Saint Energy Augmentation, Heaven Pillar Strike, Holy Impact</p>
<p>Companion Form: Mount</p>
<p>Another mount? Zhou Wen was immediately depressed. He only had one butt, so how could he ride two Companion Beasts at the same time?</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen didn’t store White Elephant into his phone, nor did he hatch it.</p>
<p>White Elephant and Great Might Vajra Bull were considered Companion Beasts of the same type. Furthermore, its stats couldn’t compare to the Great Might Vajra Bull. Even if he hatched it, it wouldn’t be of much use to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>As for using it as an ordinary Companion Beast, Zhou Wen felt that it wasn’t necessary. Now that he had the ability to grind Mythical Companion Eggs, there would definitely be many Mythical Companion Beasts with such stats in the future. Furthermore, he couldn’t take those Mythical Companion Eggs out for sale.</p>
<p>Why don’t I sell this White Elephant Companion Egg or exchange it for something? It’s useless to me anyway. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and realized that selling it didn’t seem appropriate.</p>
<p>Mythical Companion Beasts were rare. There were probably only about a hundred of them in the entire Federation. They were no longer things that money could measure.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was useless for Zhou Wen to have so much money. He was not at all materialistic.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, your luck is too good. How old are you, and you’ve already obtained another Mythical Companion Beast. I reckon the old fellows from the six families don’t have as many Mythical Companion Beasts as you,” Li Xuan said enviously.</p>
<p>“If you want it, you can buy it,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“For real?” Li Xuan was slightly taken aback. He never expected Zhou Wen to say that.</p>
<p>“Of course it’s true. I’m short of money. You can’t cheat me on the price.” Zhou Wen felt that letting Li Xuan have a Mythical Companion Beast wasn’t a bad idea.</p>
<p>“I appreciate the thought, but I can’t take this Companion Egg. I want my first Mythical Companion Egg to be something I killed myself,” Li Xuan said seriously.</p>
<p>“Qiuyan, what about you? Are you interested?” Zhou Wen asked Feng Qiuyan again.</p>
<p>“The white elephant doesn’t suit me.” Feng Qiuyan was even more direct.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was depressed. He wanted to give the Companion Egg away, but no one wanted it.</p>
<p>“Since you aren’t interested, I’ll get An Sheng to help me sell it,” Zhou Wen said as he called An Sheng.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, is there something urgent? If not, I’ll come over to you after I’m done with my matters,” An Sheng carefully said as he glanced at the sullen An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing serious. It’s just the White Elephant Companion Egg. I want to sell it. Help me see if anyone wants it,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>An Sheng was immediately alarmed when he heard that. “Young Master Wen, you want to sell the White Elephant Companion Egg? Why are you doing this? If there’s a problem with the incubation, we can help you.”</p>
<p>“No, I just feel that it’s useless. It’s a waste having it with me. I want to exchange it for something useful,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>An Sheng was immediately rendered speechless. Zhou Wen was the only one who claimed that Mythical Companion Beasts were useless.</p>
<p>However, on second thought, it made sense. Zhou Wen had too many Mythical Companion Beasts. Furthermore, with terrifying existences like Torch Dragon and Tyrant Behemoth, a White Elephant was nothing to him.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, wait for me. I’ll come to you. Let’s talk in person,” An Sheng said before hanging up.</p>
<p>“Overseer, Young Master Wen wants to sell the White Elephant Companion Egg,” An Sheng said to An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>An Sheng had said it loudly just now, so An Tianzuo had naturally heard it. He said with a deadpan expression, “Foolish. He’s beginning to become arrogant just because he has some wealth. Since he wants to sell it, buy it. Give him whatever he wants. Don’t miss a single cent.”</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen isn’t a greedy person. He might say that he wants to sell it, but he just wants to give it to us,” An Sheng explained on Zhou Wen’s behalf.</p>
<p>“There’s no sincerity at all. Is this how a gift is given to someone? Furthermore, even if it’s a gift, it’s for you. I have nothing to do with him, nor will I take his things. Therefore, it should be you, not us. Be more precise with your words in the future. As my adjutant, you aren’t even precise with your words. What kind of adjutant are you?” An Tianzuo waved his hand and said, “Don’t bother me. Go back to work.”</p>
<p>An Sheng had no choice but to leave the office and head to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, what do you want to exchange it for?” An Sheng asked as he looked at the White Elephant Companion Egg.</p>
<p>“I want five million,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That’s nothing. Mythical Companion Eggs are worth far more than that,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“As for the rest, I want some rather special Epic Essence Energy Skill Crystals,” Zhou Wen said after some thought. His offensive means were still too uniform. He wanted to try and see if he could develop a divine offensive skill.</p>
<p>“Be specific,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“It’s best if it’s an attack skill with special effects. It’s best if it’s a palm technique.” Zhou Wen had always wanted to advance his Ashen Palm, but he had no suitable direction.</p>
<p>“How about this? I don’t think you’ve thought it through. I’ll give you a catalog later for you to choose,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Alright, that’s settled then. Take the Companion Egg away.” Zhou Wen was rather satisfied with the deal.</p>
<p>An Sheng didn’t stand on ceremony as he took the White Elephant Companion Egg back and quickly returned with a catalog for Zhou Wen. There were many Epic Essence Energy Skill Crystals listed on it.</p>
<p>However, the catalog only had the names of Essence Energy Skill Crystals. He didn’t know what kind of skills they were.</p>
<p>“You probably can’t tell what kind of Essence Energy Skills they are just by their names. What you can choose is probably the attributes. It’s best if you choose an Essence Energy Skill Crystal that matches your Essence Energy Art,” An Sheng suggested.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen read for a while, unsure what Essence Energy Skill he should choose.</p>
<p>He had dropped quite a number of Essence Energy Skill Crystals and had learned quite a number of skills, but there were very few that he could usually use.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, if you can’t make up your mind, I have a suggestion,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“What’s the suggestion?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Rather than exchanging the egg for Essence Energy Skill Crystals, why don’t you exchange it for a chance?” An Sheng said with a serious expression.</p>
<p>“What chance?” Zhou Wen looked at An Sheng in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Previously, I entered a mysterious dimensional zone with the Overseer…” An Sheng explained.</p>
<h3 id='chapter681'>Chapter 681: Treasure Chest in a Maze</h3>
<p>According to An Sheng, he and An Tianzuo had accidentally fallen into a mysterious dimensional zone. It was like a maze. Furthermore, there were many treasure chests in the maze. Opening the treasure chest could give them Companion Eggs, dimensional crystals, or strange objects. It was also possible not to receive anything.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo’s first Mythical Companion Egg was obtained from there. However, one person could only open three treasure chests in the maze.</p>
<p>An Sheng’s luck wasn’t too good. He opened three treasure chests, but he didn’t obtain any Mythical Companion Eggs. However, it wasn’t as though he didn’t get anything.</p>
<p>In the maze, An Sheng obtained a mysterious pill from a treasure chest. After using it, his physique underwent some changes. In the past, An Sheng had told Zhou Wen that he was especially sensitive to Spirit Bodies. It was thanks to the mysterious pill.</p>
<p>“In this era, there’s really nothing out of the ordinary. To think that there’s actually such a good place. There are countless strange dimensional zones around the world. I wonder how many people have obtained fortuitous encounters. The fortuitous encounters of wuxia novels in the past are too common in this era,” Zhou Wen said wistfully.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had a slight advantage. Other people’s fortuitous encounters were life-threatening. As for him, all he needed to do was download the dungeon and slowly encounter them. He was bound to encounter one.</p>
<p>Other people’s fortuitous encounters could be deemed as Heaven selecting them, but the mysterious phone made Heaven’s selection inevitable.</p>
<p>“The world is changing, and humans are changing as well. It’s the same for the Federation. However, no matter how the world changes, there’s one thing that won’t change,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“What?” Zhou Wen really couldn’t think of anything in this world that wouldn’t change.</p>
<p>“The winner is king,” An Sheng said seriously.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was taken aback. This didn’t sound like An Sheng’s style. He imagined that An Sheng would say something about family.</p>
<p>An Sheng smiled and said, “Let’s talk about the maze. The maze itself changes automatically. To walk out of it, one needs to understand the Book of Changes and Chinese divination. Last time, we found a total of twelve treasure chests when Overseer took me through the maze. We opened six and left the remaining six for Madam and Miss Jing. However, in the maze, one needs the strength of an Epic to survive. Miss Jing hasn’t had the chance to go. Madam has been investigating Mr. Ouyang’s matter, so she hasn’t had the time to go either. Now, she’s investigating Chu He. I reckon she won’t be going. Why not use the White Elephant to exchange for a chance to enter and try your luck?”</p>
<p>“Since this is Sis Lan’s chance, it’s not nice of me to exchange for it, right?” Zhou Wen was somewhat hesitant.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing wrong with it. The treasure chests have at best Mythical Companion Eggs. If you’re unlucky, there might be nothing. It’s very reasonable for you to exchange a Mythical Companion Egg for an opportunity. Besides, if Madam isn’t going, having you take this opportunity is better than letting others benefit,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought that it made sense. Since Sis Lan wasn’t going, it was fair for him to use the White Elephant Companion Egg to exchange for this opportunity.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.</p>
<p>“After the matter at Dragon Gate Grotto is resolved, I’ll take you there. That place isn’t in Luoyang. Besides, before you go, you have to remember the maze’s possible path changes. I’ll give you the map of the maze later,” An Sheng said with a smile.</p>
<p>After An Sheng left, Zhou Wen continued grinding dungeons.</p>
<p>He got nothing from entering Dragon Gate Grotto and grinding the baby tiger. Zhou Wen was already numb with disappointment.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t the dungeon in-game change as well? If the game dungeons can intrinsically change, I can try cracking the golden light’s secret in-game, Zhou Wen thought greedily.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen was grinding the Endless Sea of Stars, an Essence Energy Skill Crystal dropped. On careful look, it was the Neck Gold Dragon Essence Energy Skill he had been looking forward to.</p>
<p>It finally dropped! Zhou Wen was overjoyed. He had been grinding for many days. He had already obtained quite a number of the other six palaces of the Azure Dragon’s seven palaces, but only the Neck Gold Dragon eluded him. He had finally fulfilled his wish today.</p>
<p>After impatiently absorbing the Essence Energy Skill Crystal, Zhou Wen felt another nail-like Essence Energy acupoint appear on his body. When the Essence Energy acupoint formed, the other six Essence Energy acupoints that were like dead acupoints suddenly came to life. They formed an Essence Energy circulation between the seven Essence Energy acupoints.</p>
<p>Horn, neck, root, room, heart, tail, winnowing basket. The seven palaces were identical to the shape of a dragon. The horn was the horn of a dragon, and the neck was a dragon’s neck. Root was the stem of the neck. Room corresponded to the arms, the heart was the heart, and the winnowing basket was the tail.</p>
<p>Essence Energy flowed through the seven Essence Energy points like an Azure Dragon. Zhou Wen could even hear the Azure Dragon’s long roar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at his stats in-game and realized that the seven Essence Energy Skills had vanished, turning into an Essence Energy Skill.</p>
<p>Eastern Azure Dragon Seven Lunar Mansions (Mortal): Horn Wood Scaly Dragon, Neck Gold Dragon, Root Earth Raccoon Dog, Room Solar Rabbit, Heart Lunar Fox, Tail Fire Tiger, and Winnowing-basket Water Leopard.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that the Essence Energy Skill was still at the Mortal stage, having not leveled up just because of the fusion of seven skills. However, the Essence Energy Skills that he couldn’t use previously could now be used.</p>
<p>He attempted to use the skill of the Azure Dragon’s Seven Lunar Mansions in-game. The Essence Energy in his body surged and transformed into an invisible force that coiled around his body, protecting him.</p>
<p>This feels a little similar to the Lotus Flower Buddha Body’s functions. They are all protective Essence Energy Skills, but they seem much weaker than the Lotus Flower Buddha Body. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be in a dilemma. He hadn’t used the Lotus Flower Buddha Body for a long time because it wasn’t strong enough.</p>
<p>Now, the Eastern Azure Dragon’s Seven Lunar Mansions was only at the Mortal stage, so the effects were even weaker.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen used it, he realized that the Azure Dragon Seven Nights could transform into the seven different forms—Heart Lunar Fox, Room Solar Rabbit, and so on. But he didn’t notice anything special.</p>
<p>After grinding for so long, it’s only a protective Essence Energy Skill? Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. With an Essence Energy Skill named after the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions and one that was so difficult to grind, it shouldn’t be so weak.</p>
<p>Should I try gathering the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions Essence Energy Skill and give it a try? Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to give up. He decided to grind the other Lunar Mansion skills if he had the time.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on deliberately grinding them any further. It was just that he would farm them if he saw them during his search for Astral Combat Beasts. It was best if he could gather all of them but it was not necessary.</p>
<p>He controlled the blood-colored avatar to constantly search for Astral Combat Beasts in the endless sea of stars. After heading to other stellar zones, he indeed obtained other Lunar Mansion skills.</p>
<p>After grinding for some time, Zhou Wen realized the pattern.</p>
<p>In the four Lunar Mansion regions of north, south, east, and west, every Lunar Mansion region had one Essence Energy Skill that was especially difficult to obtain. Furthermore, one couldn’t use it unless one gathered all seven Essence Energy Skills.</p>
<p>Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird, White Tiger, and Black Tortoise are in the four Lunar Mansion zones. I wonder what effects they will have if I gather all of them. It was only a passing thought for Zhou Wen; he didn’t deliberately complete the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions.</p>
<h3 id='chapter682'>Chapter 682: Stone House</h3>
<p>While Zhou Wen and company were busy guarding Dragon Gate Grotto, another Companion Beast challenged Primordial Sword Immortal. It was a Companion Beast named Heavy-Armored Titan.</p>
<p>Heavy-Armored Titan and Tyrant Behemoth were considered Companion Beasts of the same type. They had powerful physiques and formidable strength and had especially terrifying defenses.</p>
<p>Heavy-Armored Titan’s entire body was enveloped by heavy armor. When it used the power of the Wheel of Destiny, almost no one could break its heavy armor.</p>
<p>Primordial Sword Immortal wasn’t able to slice apart the heavy armor of the Titan. However, Primordial Immortal Sword’s intelligence was much higher than Heavy-Armored Titan. Furthermore, its speed was very fast, so it didn’t clash head-on with Heavy-Armored Titan that had activated its Wheel of Destiny. Once its Wheel of Destiny ended, it was completely defeated by Primordial Sword Immortal. It still couldn’t force Primordial Sword Immortal into using its Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also watched the video of the battle later. Heavy-Armored Titan and Tyrant Behemoth were indeed similar, but it wasn’t as agile as Tyrant Behemoth. The Wheel of Destiny was purely a defensive force, unlike Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength that was offensive.</p>
<p>I wonder if Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength will be able to produce a suction force on Primordial Sword Immortal. If I can suck it and force it to fight head-on, Tyrant Behemoth will have a chance of winning. If I can’t, Tyrant Behemoth will face an awkward situation like Heavy-Armored Titan, Zhou Wen thought to himself and felt that the chances of Tyrant Behemoth defeating Primordial Sword Immortal were relatively low.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that his strength wasn’t enough, but that his intelligence was too low. He wasn’t at an advantage even with his formidable strength.</p>
<p>There’s not much time left of the three-month deadline. No one can force out Primordial Sword Immortal’s Wheel of Destiny. I’m afraid it won’t be easy to vie for first place, Zhou Wen thought for a moment. Unless he got Torch Dragon to use Bright Torch Vision World, it would be difficult to snatch first place.</p>
<p>Why am I thinking so much? Who knows if the problem with Dragon Gate Grotto can be resolved before the three-month deadline. Perhaps I don’t have the time to participate in the battle. It’s useless no matter how much I think about it. Zhou Wen had to stop thinking about it. He would grind dungeons when he had the time, but most of the time, he needed to help the Sunset Army fight the dimensional creatures that had rushed out of Dragon Gate Grotto. In fact, he didn’t even have much time to grind dungeons.</p>
<p>Large numbers of dimensional creatures rushed out of Dragon Gate Grotto every day, but most of the time, no Mythical creatures appeared. They were dispatched by Chancellor Leng the few times they did appear. However, no Mythical Companion Egg dropped. Instead, a Mythical Essence Energy Skill Crystal dropped.</p>
<p>“It’s gone… The monk-robed skeleton is gone…” A soldier monitoring Dragon Gate Grotto discovered something strange. The monk-robed skeleton had vanished.</p>
<p>As for the stone house’s door, it opened, revealing pure white light from inside.</p>
<p>Just as everyone was feeling bewildered, the golden bird tore through the air and flew into the stone house.</p>
<p>It was huge, and the stone house was short and small. The door was even shorter, but when the golden bird flew in front of the stone house, its body gradually shrank to almost the size of a pigeon as it flew in.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng got Zhou Wen to join him before deciding that Leng Zongzheng, An Sheng, and Zhou Wen should enter the stone house to investigate.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo still had to guard Luoyang, so he couldn’t easily take the risk.</p>
<p>This was especially so now. Mythical creatures could rush out of Dragon Gate Grotto at any time and someone was needed to guard it. Otherwise, if they all entered, no one would be able to suppress the Mythical creatures that appeared. When that happened, Luoyang would be doomed.</p>
<p>“Although we can’t determine the attributes of the monk-robed skeleton, we can only take things one step at a time now. After entering the stone house, safety first. If you discover anything amiss, you have to leave immediately,” Leng Zongzheng exhorted Zhou Wen and An Sheng.</p>
<p>The two of them expressed their understanding before Leng Zongzheng led them to the stone house.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo watched them go up the mountain, but he didn’t say a word.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng summoned a tiny beast to scout ahead. Without the monk-robed skeleton, the golden light in the mountain temple no longer existed. There was no danger.</p>
<p>The three of them successfully entered the mountain temple and arrived in front of the stone house.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen constantly tried observing the situation inside the stone house, but be it his vision or Truth Listener’s ability, neither of them could penetrate the white light inside.</p>
<p>“Follow behind me. If anything happens, retreat immediately. Don’t hesitate,” Leng Zongzheng exhorted again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took out the Substitute Talisman and stuck it on his body. At the same time, he switched his Essence Energy Art to Dao Body. He had Gods Retreat Life Soul on standby.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the door was too small. If he summoned Six-Winged, it wouldn’t be able to enter. Therefore, Zhou Wen temporarily didn’t summon Six-Winged. He planned on summoning it immediately after entering.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng had already gotten the little beast to enter the stone house. After confirming that there was no danger of death, he led Zhou Wen and An Sheng into the stone house.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked in and entered the white light. He found it very strange as though he was walking in water, but the white light was something he couldn’t touch.</p>
<p>Due to the white light, Zhou Wen couldn’t see anything. However, this feeling didn’t last long. After taking three steps, the white light in front of him vanished as his eyes regained clarity.</p>
<p>However, the scene in front of him left Zhou Wen alarmed.</p>
<p>The scene in front of him wasn’t a stone house. In front of him was a mysterious kingdom. The architectural style was very strange. The towers, buildings, monuments, and rooftops all had various Buddha statues.</p>
<p>What was even more surprising was that this nation was made of gold bricks. All the buildings and statues were made of gold. They looked resplendent and dazzling.</p>
<p>All sorts of mysterious Buddha statues dazzled the eyes. Zhou Wen had never seen many of them before, and they didn’t match the style of Dragon Gate Grotto.</p>
<p>In the center of the Buddhist kingdom, there was a huge golden Buddha statue that was more than ten thousand feet tall. From afar, the Buddha statue’s body tore through the clouds. Its eyes were lowered as though it was looking down at everything.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the Buddha statue’s shape and realized that it resembled the Lochana Buddha. According to what Zhou Wen knew, Lochana Buddha was a Buddha who had obtained the Buddha Fruit of Absolute Truth. He was a symbol of wisdom in Buddhism.</p>
<p>Legend had it that in Dragon Gate Grotto, there was a Lochana Buddha carved to the likes of an ancient female monarch.</p>
<p>Of course, that was only a legend.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief when he saw An Sheng and Leng Zongzheng beside him. When he looked at them, he saw them looking towards the front of the street.</p>
<p>The skeleton in monk robes was walking on the long street. With the golden crystal bead in hand, it walked towards the huge Buddha step by step like it was holding a miniature sun.</p>
<p>For some reason, the monk-robed skeleton walked very slowly as though it was treading on thin ice.</p>
<p>In the sky, the golden bird spread its wings and also flew in the direction of the huge Buddha. Its body was like a great Roc as it spread its wings for 500 kilometers, but for some reason, it failed to close the distance between it and the huge Buddha.</p>
<h3 id='chapter683'>Chapter 683: Urna</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen had already summoned the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon and had it appear on his back in the form of dragon wings. He didn’t dare be careless when entering such a strange place in reality.</p>
<p>He turned his head and realized that there was no longer a stone door behind him. Behind him was an endless void. The huge golden Buddha nation was floating in the void like an island while they were standing at the edge of the golden Buddha nation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked around and failed to find a way back. He looked at An Sheng and asked, “Ah Sheng, can you tell the way back?”</p>
<p>An Sheng shook his head and said, “I can’t tell. It’s probably going to be troublesome. Young Master Wen, you have to be careful at all times.”</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng said, “Look at the spot between the giant Buddha’s eyebrows.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and An Sheng looked over and saw a huge piece of sun-like glass between the Buddha’s brows that emitted a strange glow.</p>
<p>“In Buddhism, that’s an Urna. It’s one of the thirty-two aspects of Gautama Buddha. It represents the source of all religions,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng nodded and said, “An Urna is one of the original forms of Buddha. It shrinks between the eyebrows. And when a craftsman carves a Buddha statue, there’s no way to depict the true appearance of an Urna. They usually just carve a circle or spiral to represent it. Look carefully at the Urna. Do you find anything odd?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and An Sheng looked over and felt that the Urna was blinding, as though it was clear glass.</p>
<p>As Truth Listener’s power couldn’t reach such a distance, Zhou Wen didn’t sense any danger descending. He switched to the Small Perfection of Wisdom and the Hell King Life Soul to strengthen his senses before carefully looking at the Urna.</p>
<p>Upon doing so, Zhou Wen immediately realized something. The Urna wasn’t glass. It was clearly a cocoon formed from crystal threads.</p>
<p>“That’s… the cocoon of a Guardian…” Zhou Wen said in surprise.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng said with a heavy expression, “It’s probably a cocoon of a Guardian. I originally thought that Dragon Gate Grotto only had one in Dragon’s Well, I didn’t expect there to be another one.”</p>
<p>“Could it be that everything that happened in Dragon Gate Grotto is due to the cocoon of the Guardian? But that doesn’t make sense. Doesn’t a Guardian only choose humans as contractors? Why are the monk-robed skeleton and the golden-winged bird here?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>No one could answer his question. The three of them watched from afar as the monk-clothed skeleton walked towards the Buddha and the golden-winged bird flew at high speed.</p>
<p>However, be it the skeleton in monk robes or the golden-winged bird, they couldn’t close the distance. It was as though they were running on the spot.</p>
<p>“There’s a huge terror hidden in this Buddhist kingdom. It’s not something ordinary creatures can pass through. Little Zhou, summon that Great Might Vajra Bull and see if it can approach the Buddha statue,” said Leng Zongzheng.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull and made it try walking in the direction of the Buddha.</p>
<p>It was odd. The golden-winged bird’s flying speed was tremendous. It could fly hundreds of kilometers with a flap of its wings, but it was unable to approach the huge Buddha.</p>
<p>However, the Great Might Vajra Bull easily closed the distance by slowly walking on the golden bricks. It was about to catch up to the monk-robed skeleton.</p>
<p>“As expected. Only Buddhist-type creatures can travel through the Buddhist kingdom. That monk-robed skeleton isn’t a Buddhist-type creature after all. It’s probably relying on the crystal in its hand to slowly walk towards the Buddha. As for the golden-winged bird, it can’t approach it no matter what. It’s worse than the monk-robed skeleton.” As Leng Zongzheng spoke, he got Zhou Wen to summon the Great Might Vajra Bull back to prevent it from meeting the monk-robed skeleton.</p>
<p>At that moment, a bird’s cry rang through the clouds. The golden-winged bird’s body expanded like a golden cloud that blotted out the sky. It nearly enveloped the entire Buddhist kingdom in its shadow.</p>
<p>It flapped its wings as a terrifying power tore through space and rapidly approached the Buddha. It actually broke through the restrictions of the Buddhist kingdom’s strange powers.</p>
<p>What terrifying might. Only the gigantified Tyrant Behemoth can match it. Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>Soon, the golden-winged bird arrived in front of the Buddha statue. As Leng Zongzheng had expected, it had indeed come for the cocoon of the Guardian. It flew to the top of the Buddha’s head and grabbed at it.</p>
<p>The monk-robed skeleton also noticed the golden-winged Bird’s actions. A strange glint flashed in its eyes as it lifted the crystal in its hand. A golden beam shot out from the crystal and instantly struck the golden-winged bird.</p>
<p>The golden-winged bird didn’t dare let the golden beam of light strike it. It gave up on the cocoon of the Guardian and flapped its wings to dodge.</p>
<p>The crystal in the skeleton’s hand constantly emitted golden beams, preventing the golden-winged bird from approaching the cocoon.</p>
<p>The golden-winged bird’s actions were interrupted a few times. It immediately turned ferocious as it flapped its wings and transformed into a golden beam that charged at the monk-robed skeleton. Its eyes flashed with lightning.</p>
<p>As the skeleton advanced, it raised the crystal in its hand and emitted a golden glow that fought the golden-winged bird.</p>
<p>The golden-winged bird seemed to be afraid of the crystal in its hand. It was forced back by the crystal’s light repeatedly.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng stared at the monk-clothed skeleton and the crystal in its hand for a long time as though he was thinking about something. After a while, Leng Zongzheng suddenly turned to Zhou Wen and said, “Little Zhou, get the Great Might Vajra Bull to carry us to the Buddha.”</p>
<p>Although Leng Zongzheng didn’t explain why he was doing so, Zhou Wen hurriedly summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull when he saw his solemn expression.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Great Might Vajra Bull was huge. It was more than big enough to seat three people.</p>
<p>The three of them sat on the bull’s back. The Great Might Vajra Bull immediately ran towards the Buddha.</p>
<p>The monk-robed skeleton needed to walk towards the Buddha step by step. As for the Great Might Vajra Bull, it ran very quickly. Soon, it caught up with the monk-robed skeleton. While it was fighting the golden-winged Roc, it charged past it.</p>
<p>When the monk-robed skeleton saw the Great Might Vajra Bull rush over with three people on it, the strange light in its eyes immediately lit up. The crystal in its hand immediately emitted a golden glow that resembled the one in the mountain temple. It enveloped a large area, including the Great Might Vajra Bull, Zhou Wen, and company.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately felt the Runic Heavy Armor on his body melt like bubbles. Even the Great Might Vajra Bull’s body couldn’t withstand the terrifying golden light. It was like a melting candle as its golden flesh melted.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng and Ah Sheng’s situation was the same. The armor on their bodies was melting, and in an instant, their armor was about to collapse.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pulled out the Golden Overlord Sword and slashed at the monk-robed skeleton. At the same time, he ordered the Great Might Vajra Bull to use the Soul Suppression Bell.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The moment the Soul Suppression Bell sounded, the monk-robed skeleton was stunned. The golden light emitted from the crystal in its hand also dimmed.</p>
<p>Taking this opportunity, Leng Zongzheng and Ah Sheng attacked at the same time. Leng Zongzheng summoned the Azure Rainbow Flying Sword that Zhou Wen had previously seen and slashed at the monk-robed skeleton. As for Ah Sheng, he used Love Letter’s text ability and sent a text to the monk-robed skeleton.</p>
<h3 id='chapter684'>Chapter 684: Obstruction</h3>
<p>The duration of the dizziness caused by the Soul Suppression Bell was too short. When the golden sword beam slashed at the monk-robed skeleton, the skeleton had already reacted. It held the crystal in one hand and waved its other hand.</p>
<p>The golden sword beam was immediately shattered. The Azure Rainbow Flying Sword was sent flying almost simultaneously.</p>
<p>An Sheng’s text came in front of it. It opened its mouth and blew out a strange cold wind that scattered the power of the text.</p>
<p>Despite fighting three alone, the skeleton still had the upper hand. It held up the crystal in its hand again and shot out a golden beam.</p>
<p>However, the golden beam wasn’t directed at Zhou Wen and company. It transformed into a beam that shot into the sky, targeting the golden-winged bird.</p>
<p>It turned out that the golden-winged bird had taken advantage of the battle between the monk-robed skeleton and the trio to fly towards the Buddha, hoping to snatch the cocoon of the Guardian from the Buddha’s glabella.</p>
<p>“Let’s go to the Buddha quickly.” Leng Zongzheng didn’t seem to be in the mood to fight the monk-robed skeleton as he shouted loudly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly got the Great Might Vajra Bull to rush towards the Buddha. The monk-robed skeleton and the golden-winged bird were occupied with fighting, so they couldn’t be bothered with them.</p>
<p>Soon, the Great Might Vajra Bull ran to the foot of the Buddha, but it couldn’t fly. It was difficult to ascend the Buddha.</p>
<p>“It should be fine now. Let’s head up,” Leng Zongzheng said as he leaped up from the bull’s back. He stepped onto the Azure Rainbow Flying Sword and flew towards the cocoon of the Guardian.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen unsummoned the Great Might Vajra Bull and flapped his wings to catch up.</p>
<p>Ah Sheng quickly jumped up the Buddha statue. He was slightly slower. Leng Zongzheng seemed to be very anxious. Without waiting for them, he charged forward alone.</p>
<p>The golden-winged bird and the monk-robed skeleton, who were originally fighting, realized that Leng Zongzheng and company were charging towards the cocoon of the Guardian. They stopped their tussle simultaneously and attacked Leng Zongzheng.</p>
<p>“Help me hold them back. Don’t let them come up.” Leng Zongzheng was extremely bold. He leaped up from the Azure Rainbow Flying Sword and lunged towards the cocoon of the Guardian. As for the Azure Rainbow Flying Sword, it headed straight for the monk-robed skeleton.</p>
<p>Another white beam flew out. It was the white parrot that Zhou Wen had seen before. It flapped its wings and faced the golden-winged bird.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen brandished his sword and slashed at the monk-robed skeleton. The crystal in the skeleton’s hand was too terrifying. If he held it back, he could give Leng Zongzheng greater opportunities.</p>
<p>However, with a flash of golden light from the monk-robed skeleton’s crystal, the golden sword beam shattered. The Azure Rainbow Flying Sword automatically flew aside, not daring to be illuminated by the golden light.</p>
<p>“Go!” Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth and made it charge at the monk-robed skeleton while he charged at the golden-winged bird.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth landed on the ground and roared at the skeleton.</p>
<p>The crystal in the monk-clothed skeleton’s hand emitted a golden glow as it struck Tyrant Behemoth. Tyrant Behemoth raised its arm to block, but its arm was penetrated by the golden light.</p>
<p>In the next second, Tyrant Behemoth activated Absolute Strength. Its body turned into a black hole, causing the surrounding space to distort and form a strange suction force.</p>
<p>The monk-clothed skeleton’s body was sucked towards Tyrant Behemoth, but it refused to be outdone. It raised the crystal in its hand again and shot out a terrifying golden light towards Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>However, the golden light was suppressed by Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength. Tyrant Behemoth charged forward, tanking the golden light before punching the monk-robed skeleton.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth blasted open a huge pit in the gold-bricked ground. As for the monk-robed skeleton, it used some unknown method to dodge Tyrant Behemoth’s attack and moved a few hundred meters away.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth roared and immediately chased after it.</p>
<p>In the sky, the white parrot actually spoke the human language. As it flew, it cursed, “Little eagle brat, go back and ask your mother. See who’s son you are? How dare you not kneel down and call me daddy when you see me? You’re worse than a beast. If I had known, I would have ejaculated you towards the wall…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had never seen a Companion Beast being so vulgar and offensive. Its strength was inferior to the golden-winged bird, so it could only flee for its life. However, as it fled, it kept on cursing the golden-winged bird. This infuriated the golden-winged bird, making it abandon its attacks on Leng Zongzheng as it directed its sights on the white parrot. It wanted the parrot dead.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Wen felt his head spin after hearing its words. He really wanted to slap it.</p>
<p>“A son killing his dad… Aren’t you afraid of heavenly punishment… You’ll be fried into a fragrant, mala eagle…” the white parrot cried as it fled.</p>
<p>It was vulgar, but its flying speed wasn’t slow at all. It was actually comparable to the golden-winged bird. Furthermore, this fellow’s flying trajectory clearly had some technique involved. It wasn’t as simple as relying on speed.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen rushed forward, the golden-winged bird was already enraged. Its body emitted a golden glow as mysterious ancient text appeared on its feathers, causing its body to emit a terrifying divine glow. With a flap of its wings, its body tore through the void and appeared above the white parrot. Its claws, that resembled sharp blades, were about to grab the white parrot.</p>
<p>The white parrot’s figure phased away as it used a teleportation skill to avoid the golden-winged bird’s talons.</p>
<p>“No matter how awesome a son is, he’s still a son. If you want to capture me, spend another ten thousand years training and there might still be hope,” the white parrot cursed as it fled in the opposite direction of the Buddha statue.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, its teleportation skill was the same as Zhou Wen’s Lost Country. It couldn’t be used continuously. The golden-winged bird that had already gone berserk instantly caught up to it and grabbed it in midair.</p>
<p>“Let go of your daddy. There’s nothing impressive about flying fast. If you have the guts, let’s fight on the ground.” The white parrot had already been caught, but its mouth didn’t stop.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen flapped his wings and slashed at the golden-winged bird’s claw, hoping to save the white parrot.</p>
<p>To his surprise, the golden-winged bird hated the white parrot to the core. It ignored the golden sword beam and retracted its claw, about to tear the white parrot’s body into pieces.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>When the golden sword beam struck the bird’s claw, white feathers flew everywhere. The golden-winged bird’s claws were covered in white feathers, but the parrot’s body was gone.</p>
<p>“Little eagle brat, let daddy teach you one more move. This is slough off the cicada’s golden shell from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Learn it…” The white parrot had a few feathers left on its body. It was like a featherless chicken, but it was still making bold claims.</p>
<p>The fellow wasn’t stupid either. As it shouted, it fled behind Zhou Wen. The wings that were without feathers could still fly very quickly.</p>
<p>What the hell is this bird! Zhou Wen was rendered speechless. If he were the enemy of this crappy bird, he would wish to slaughter it immediately.</p>
<p>The golden-winged bird clearly had the same thought as well. It rushed over immediately as the golden light on its body flashed like lightning. Its speed was unbelievably fast.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was right in front of the parrot. He immediately bore the brunt of the attack. He had already used Transcendent Flying Immortal to dodge the golden-winged bird’s attack, but the divine-level Transcendent Flying Immortal was like an electric tricycle against a sports car in front of the golden-winged bird. It was overtaken before it even started.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen retreated, he slashed out Golden Sword Aura. However, when it struck the golden feathers, it bounced off. Ignoring the fact that he failed to injure the golden-winged bird, he couldn’t even obstruct it for a moment.</p>
<h3 id='chapter685'>Chapter 685: Buddha Annihilation</h3>
<p>A strange glint flashed in Zhou Wen’s eyes as he was about to activate Torch Dragon Youngling’s eye mirror. He wanted to use Bright Torch Vision World to kill the ferocious golden-winged bird.</p>
<p>To his surprise, he suddenly heard a loud boom. It came from the Buddha’s glabella.</p>
<p>The golden-winged bird seemed to be jolted awake as it stopped pursuing Zhou Wen. It looked up at the Buddha.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also looked over and saw that Leng Zongzheng had already arrived in front of the cocoon of the Guardian. He held a saber in his hand as he stabbed it at the cocoon.</p>
<p>However, in the cocoon of the Guardian, a hand broke out and grabbed the tip of Leng Zongzheng’s saber.</p>
<p>The hand suffused a Buddhistic glow. It was fair and clean, and it didn’t look powerful. However, the sharp blade failed to injure the hand at all.</p>
<p>Could the sound just now be from the palm tearing out of the cocoon? Just as Zhou Wen was feeling alarmed, he heard a crack.</p>
<p>The hand snapped the saber in Leng Zongzheng’s hand.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng retreated and stared at the cocoon of the Guardian with a solemn expression. He muttered to himself, “It’s still too late. Has it already developed to such a stage?”</p>
<p>Apart from Tyrant Behemoth, who was still chasing the monk-robed skeleton and hammering down, everyone stopped and looked at the cocoon of the Guardian.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>The Guardian’s cocoon constantly shattered as crystalline fragments fell off, emitting a clean Buddhistic glow from the cocoon.</p>
<p>The Buddha statues in the Buddhist kingdom seemed to come to life at that moment. Golden Buddha statues, be it sculptures or carvings on the walls, emitted the sound of chanting.</p>
<p>In the entire Buddhist kingdom, the mysterious murmurs reverberated like a chant. It was as though they were praying or welcoming something.</p>
<p>Amidst the murmurs, a golden Buddhistic glow rose from all the Buddha statues. The Buddhistic glow gathered at the Buddha’s glabella and flowed into the cracked cocoon.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>Most of the cocoon formed by the crystal threads had shattered. Zhou Wen and company could already see the creature inside the cocoon.</p>
<p>It was bhikkhu, who was dressed in white monk robes. He looked no different from a human, but there was an Urna on his forehead. It was crystalline-like jade and had spiral patterns.</p>
<p>He sat cross-legged in the cocoon as an infinite Buddhistic glow converged in front of him. They transformed into Buddha beads that automatically joined together, turning into a string of golden Buddha beads.</p>
<p>As the Buddhistic glow intensified, Buddha’s figure appeared on the Buddha beads.</p>
<p>When the cocoon of the Guardian completely shattered, the string of Buddha beads finally condensed and landed in the bhikkhu’s hand.</p>
<p>With the Buddha beads in hand, the entire Buddhist kingdom fell silent. The chanting sounds vanished as the Buddhistic glow on the Buddha statue vanished.</p>
<p>“Buddha is annihilated with my birth…” The bhikkhu slowly opened his eyes. His eyes were so clear that it made people feel as though looking at him was desecrating him.</p>
<p>However, with the bhikkhu’s voice, all the Buddha statues in the Buddhist Kingdom shattered. Even the thousand-foot-tall giant Buddha statue collapsed.</p>
<p>The Buddha statue crumbled as it slowly sank into the void.</p>
<p>The monk-robed skeleton and the golden-winged bird trembled as they took on a pleading pose to the bhikkhu who held Buddha beads in his hands and pressed down with his other hand.</p>
<p>A huge palm print appeared above the Buddha kingdom. Tyrant Behemoth, who continued attacking the skeleton, was slammed into the ground.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly unsummoned Tyrant Behemoth. Thankfully, Tyrant Behemoth wasn’t killed. It was only slightly injured.</p>
<p>However, despite being in its Absolute Strength state, it had been forcefully suppressed and had even suffered some injuries. The bhikkhu’s strength was unimaginable.</p>
<p>“Chancellor, do we retreat?” An Sheng asked in horror as he rapidly moved through the collapsing Buddha kingdom.</p>
<p>“There’s nowhere to retreat to. I’ll deal with him. The two of you will do as you see fit,” Leng Zongzheng answered without looking back. Then, he looked at bhikkhu and asked, “What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“Buddha Annihilation.”</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng didn’t say a word. However, divine beams rose from his body one after another. The divine beams condensed in front of him, turning into a beautiful black-clothed goddess with a harp in her arms.</p>
<p>Guardian? Does Chancellor Leng actually have a Guardian? Zhou Wen saw the black-clothed goddess holding a harp in front of Leng Zongzheng and immediately recognized her identity. She was actually a Guardian.</p>
<p>“Name?” The bhikkhu asked as he looked at the harp-holding goddess.</p>
<p>“Divine Harp.” When the goddess answered, her body had already transformed into streams of light that fused into Leng Zongzheng’s body. At the same time, a black suit formed over him.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng’s aura also underwent an earth-shattering change due to the fusion of the Divine Harp. He was like a devil in a suit.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng sat in midair as the Demonic Organ Throne appeared in front of him. The vertical tubes that resembled a castle and the rows of keys emitted a solemn and mysterious aura.</p>
<p>It was different from the Demonic Organ Throne that Zhou Wen had seen the last time. This time, because Leng Zongzheng had broken through to the divine level with the help of Divine Harp, he became even more terrifying. Every note emitted a terrifying glow.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng pressed his hands on the keys as harp music came from the huge vertical tubes that resembled a castle.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t think that the harp tones were anything special, but the Buddha beads in Buddha Annihilation’s hand glowed brightly as though it was resisting some kind of power.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to figure out what was so special about the harp music. This was because the golden-winged bird had already charged at Leng Zongzheng, as though it was helping Buddha Annihilation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately released two Golden Battle God Halberds and attacked the golden-winged bird from the side. The Golden Overlord Sword in his hand slashed over.</p>
<p>The bald parrot stood on Zhou Wen’s shoulder and shouted at the golden-winged bird, “Little eagle brat… Your daddy is here…”</p>
<p>The monk-robed skeleton also wanted to charge at Leng Zongzheng. An Sheng rushed over and stopped him, but An Sheng only had one Mythical creature—Love Letter. Love Letter was far from being the monk-robed skeleton’s match. All it could do was constantly retreat and use various strange skills to delay the monk-robed skeleton’s advance.</p>
<p>Seeing that An Sheng was in danger, Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth again to help An Sheng fight the monk-robed skeleton.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth had suffered some injuries, but thankfully, it wasn’t seriously injured. After charging into the collapsing Buddhist kingdom, it immediately activated its Absolute Strength again.</p>
<p>For some reason, the monk-clothed skeleton fearlessly faced Tyrant Behemoth and stuffed the crystal in its eye socket.</p>
<p>The moment the crystal entered his socket, it emitted a golden glow. It made the skeleton’s bones burn with golden flames as though it was bathing in Nirvana Flames.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The monk-clothed skeleton’s bone fist collided with Tyrant Behemoth’s fist. They were evenly matched and neither of them managed to gain the upper hand. The terrifying shockwave produced from the collision of strength caused the already damaged streets to be further destroyed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter686'>Chapter 686: Violent Annihilation</h3>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth was extremely violent and ferocious as it constantly attacked. Its Absolute Strength had a time limit, and it had already used it for nearly ten minutes, Now that it was activated again, it only had about twenty minutes remaining. It needed to determine the victor in twenty minutes.</p>
<p>An Sheng didn’t attack the monk-robed skeleton with Tyrant Behemoth. He watched from the side as though he was observing and searching for an opportunity.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen fought the golden-winged bird, the dragon wings on his back trembled. The two Golden Battle God Halberd attacked from both sides as the Golden Overlord Sword in his hand constantly slashed out Golden Sword Aura.</p>
<p>However, the golden-winged bird’s speed was just too fast. It was so fast that Zhou Wen’s eyes couldn’t keep up with its actions. Before he could see what was happening, he heard a crack. One of his Golden Battle God Halberds had been grabbed by its claws. Once it exerted strength, the Golden Battle God Halberd immediately snapped into several pieces.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to worry about the Golden Battle God Halberd’s death. He pushed Transcendent Flying Immortal’s speed to its limits and quickly escaped into the distance.</p>
<p>If Tyrant Behemoth had absolute strength, then the golden-winged bird had absolute speed. Zhou Wen didn’t fly for long before it caught up.</p>
<p>Without thinking, the eye mirror in Zhou Wen’s eye condensed a strange luster, making one of his eyes look like a mirror as he looked at the golden-winged bird.</p>
<p>The golden-winged bird seemed to sense danger. The mysterious ancient text on its wings shimmered as it vanished from Zhou Wen’s sight.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a heavy blow on his back. His body slammed into the ground like a meteor, leaving a huge hole in the golden palace.</p>
<p>The golden-winged bird’s might was even more ferocious. With a flash, it grabbed the Golden Battle God Halberd that was flying in the air and instantly snapped it into several pieces.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen crawled out of the ground and felt unbearable pain, but he wasn’t seriously injured. As for the Substitute Talisman, it had already dissipated into ashes.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I brought the Substitute Talisman. If I had known, I would have drawn a few more. Zhou Wen was alarmed. If not for the Substitute Talisman, even if he didn’t die, the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon would have died.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Substitute Talismans were too difficult to draw. Success or failure depended on fate. Zhou Wen had drawn so many of them, but he had only succeeded once when his heart and mind were one.</p>
<p>Later, he drew many more times, but none of them succeeded. Zhou Wen was too frustrated to continue drawing.</p>
<p>After the golden-winged bird snapped the Golden Battle God Halberd, its bloody, cold eyes looked into the palace’s hole. It flapped its wings again and instantly vanished.</p>
<p>F**k you. Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated as goosebumps rose. Knowing that danger was approaching, he didn’t dare hesitate any further as he summoned Torch Dragon Youngling.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon Youngling’s massive body appeared and burst through the palace. It looked up angrily at the sky.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood on its head and used the Truth Listener earring’s ability to observe his surroundings. He realized that the golden-winged bird had already flown into the sky. Clearly, it was afraid of Torch Dragon’s appearance.</p>
<p>However, in just an instant, the golden-winged bird turned ferocious again. It flapped its wings and transformed into a stream of light that vanished. It was so fast that he couldn’t see its trajectory.</p>
<p>“Torch Dragon!” Zhou Wen called out.</p>
<p>In fact, without Zhou Wen’s order, Torch Dragon had already moved. The scales on its body converged like eyelids as rows of Torch Dragon Eyes appeared. It was its World King Transformation.</p>
<p>Countless Torch Dragon Eyes used Bright Torch Vision World at the same time, opening up like countless mirrors.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen felt something amiss. He turned his head and saw the golden-winged bird appear behind Torch Dragon. Its body flashed like a bolt of lightning as its wings flapped wildly. Its face was filled with horror as though it was resisting some invisible terrifying force.</p>
<p>However, it only struggled for a moment before its figure suddenly vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw the golden-winged bird’s figure appear in the eyes on Torch Dragon’s back. It struggled and churned inside before disappearing.</p>
<p>The Torch Dragon Vision World ended as Torch Dragon Youngling was taken out of its World King Transformation state. Torch Dragon Youngling was exhausted and its strength was greatly reduced. Its combat strength dropped drastically to the level of Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. It couldn’t even use Bright Torch Vision World again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly unsummoned Torch Dragon Youngling. He couldn’t let it take the risk. This was Zhou Wen’s strongest trump card.</p>
<p>What a huge loss. Zhou Wen felt his heart ache.</p>
<p>He originally wanted to see if he could find an opportunity to kill the golden-winged bird, but he ended up losing a Substitute Talisman and two Golden Battle God Halberds.</p>
<p>Although Bright Torch Vision World was powerful, it didn’t leave anything behind after killing its opponent. This was a fatal flaw. Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to use the skill unless it was absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Tyrant Behemoth kept bombarding the monk-robed skeleton. Its powerful strength forced the monk-robed skeleton to retreat as its bones cracked.</p>
<p>However, the golden light on its body burned like flames, making its body seem like an immortal body. It immediately recovered from any injuries. Although Tyrant Behemoth had the upper hand, it ultimately failed to kill it.</p>
<p>Is Absolute Strength about to run out of time? Zhou Wen did the math and realized that there were about ten minutes left. However, from the looks of it, Tyrant Behemoth probably wouldn’t be able to kill the monk-robed skeleton in ten minutes.</p>
<p>Suddenly, An Sheng, who had been observing from the side, pressed his palm on the ground and vanished like a ghost.</p>
<p>At this moment, Tyrant Behemoth sent the monk-robed skeleton retreating a few steps with one punch, leaving it staggering.</p>
<p>An Sheng strangely crawled out from the ground behind the skeleton and leaped up. His finger was like a venomous scorpion’s stinger as he tapped at the back of the skeleton’s head.</p>
<p>He imprinted a mysterious character on the back of the monk-robed skeleton’s head. Zhou Wen recognized that it was the word “Quake,” one of Love Letter’s abilities.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The crystal in the skeleton’s eye sockets was actually jolted out because of An Sheng’s finger strike. It flew out and landed on the ground.</p>
<p>The golden flames on the monk-robed skeleton’s body immediately vanished. Tyrant Behemoth’s attack followed up the chain of attacks. The monk-robed skeleton raised its fist in a panic to receive the attack.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Without the augmentation of the crystal, the skeleton’s bony hand was shattered by Tyrant Behemoth and its body staggered backward.</p>
<p>The berserk Tyrant Behemoth pummeled the monk-robed skeleton repeatedly. It only took a few punches to shatter the skeleton’s hands.</p>
<p>The monk-clothed skeleton was sent tumbling to the ground. Tyrant Behemoth pressed one of its claws on its sternum, while the other struck its skull. With a few punches, the skull shattered.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth lifted the skeleton’s cracked body with one hand and placed it into its mouth. It chewed a few times before swallowing it.</p>
<p>“Bro… Take a look to see if there are any Companion Eggs left behind…” Zhou Wen was somewhat speechless. What kind of pet was this? It ate anything it killed without leaving anything behind.</p>
<p>However, since it had swallowed and couldn’t spit it out, all Zhou Wen could do was quickly run over and pick up the crystal that An Sheng had forced out of the skeleton’s eye socket.</p>
<h3 id='chapter687'>Chapter 687: Buddhistic Glow Cleansing</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>In the sky, the music was demonic.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t tell what was so special about it. The music didn’t seem to have any effect on them, but for some reason, when he heard it, he still felt a shiver from the bottom of his heart. It was as though there was a fear that stemmed from the depths of his soul.</p>
<p>As for Buddha Annihilation, it seemed to be enveloped by a dark force. It was like a devil hidden in the darkness, allowing people to sense his existence but not see it.</p>
<p>However, the power of darkness was blocked by the golden light emitted by the Buddha beads. The devil-like power failed to penetrate its body, and the two forces remained in a stalemate.</p>
<p>The golden-winged bird and the monk-robed skeleton were killed. Buddha Annihilation glanced at Zhou Wen and An Sheng, who were rushing over. The Urna between its brows revolved as though a Buddhistic glow had descended upon the Buddhist kingdom.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and An Sheng were just about to rush over to help Leng Zongzheng when they saw the Buddhistic glow fall. They were alarmed as they used their Essence Energy Skills and Companion Beasts to block the Buddhistic glow.</p>
<p>However, they soon realized that the Buddhistic glow didn’t affect them at all. However, wherever the Buddhistic glow descended, it illuminated the crumbling Buddhist kingdom like it was cleansing it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and An Sheng suddenly widened their eyes. Amidst the cleansed area, the golden-winged bird and the monk-robed skeleton, that had just been killed, were reborn and bathing in the Buddhistic glow.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was dumbfounded as he said to An Sheng in bewilderment, “Ah Sheng, pinch me. I want to know if I’m hallucinating.”</p>
<p>“I think I’m hallucinating as well.” An Sheng swallowed his saliva and said with great difficulty, “Young Master Wen, your Companion Beasts were able to kill them just now. They should still be capable of doing so now, right?”</p>
<p>“No way. My Companion Beast is enervated from earlier. If those two fellows really come back to life, the method from before definitely won’t work,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Torch Dragon Youngling was greatly enervated after using World King Transformation. It was useless for the time being. Even if he released it, it only had about the same combat strength as the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. Fighting the golden-winged bird was courting death.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth had almost used up all the time for its Absolute Strength. Without the suppression of Absolute Strength, it was probably no match for the monk-robed skeleton.</p>
<p>The only good news was that the monk-robed skeleton, which was bathed in a Buddhistic glow, did not have the crystal in its hand. From the looks of it, the crystal wasn’t part of the monk-robed skeleton. The only one was the one in Zhou Wen’s hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already studied it, but he hadn’t figured out how to make it emit the golden light to injure the enemy.</p>
<p>The skeleton in monk robes and the golden-winged bird had returned to life. They looked no different from when they had first entered the Buddhist kingdom. They were brimming with energy as four pairs of eyes stared at Zhou Wen and An Sheng.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, do you have any other Companion Beasts that can kill them?” An Sheng asked.</p>
<p>“I do have Companion Beasts, but I don’t know if I can kill them,” Zhou Wen said with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>“Then let’s prepare to risk our lives,” An Sheng said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“Son, come here. Your daddy is here…” The bald parrot was still alive. It jumped onto Zhou Wen’s shoulder and shouted at the golden-winged bird.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen punched it to the ground and thought to himself, Why would Leng Zongzheng raise such a Companion Beast?</p>
<p>The monk-robed skeleton and the golden-winged bird rushed towards Zhou Wen. The monk-robed skeleton’s target was the crystal in Zhou Wen’s hand, and the golden-winged bird clearly hated Zhou Wen and the parrot to death. It wanted to kill Zhou Wen and the parrot first.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly summoned Tyrant Behemoth and allowed it to clash with the monk-robed skeleton again. Although Tyrant Behemoth was unable to defeat the skeleton without Absolute Strength’s suppression, it wasn’t a problem for it to hold out for some time.</p>
<p>Now, the most difficult thing to deal with was the golden-winged bird. It was too fast—so fast that Zhou Wen couldn’t dodge its attack. If he couldn’t kill it, Zhou Wen would be the one to die.</p>
<p>Truth Listener and Demonic Neonate were summoned by Zhou Wen at the same time. Zhou Wen quickly retreated while An Sheng consciously retreated to the other side and ran towards Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>After Demonic Neonate landed, she hid herself as she took in the situation. Under Zhou Wen’s orders, Truth Listener’s earring shattered as its body instantly transformed into a terrifying dark-gold ferocious beast.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen grabbed the bald parrot and threw it at Truth Listener. “Quick, scream. Use all your strength to curse all its ancestors.”</p>
<p>“What the f**k do you take me for? I must curse just because you want me to do so? Whether or not I want to scold my son depends on my mood. Now that I’m in a good mood, I’m not going to be petty with that young eagle brat.” The bald parrot was still mumbling, but the golden-winged bird had already charged over with a shriek. It was so fast that no one could see its figure clearly. All they saw was a flash of golden lightning in the sky.</p>
<p>Truth Listener seemed to have discovered the golden-winged bird’s location as it phased away and extended its claw.</p>
<p>However, its body’s reaction speed failed to keep up with the golden-winged bird’s speed. It failed to grab the golden-winged bird that flashed past. Instead, the golden-winged bird’s blade-like wings sliced past its chest.</p>
<p>Truth Listener retreated as its legs tore open two long ditches on the golden-bricked ground.</p>
<p>The golden-winged bird’s attack only left shallow marks on the dark golden scales on Truth Listener’s chest. It failed to cut through the scales.</p>
<p>Truth Listener had the Indestructible Vajra Body skill. Even Tyrant Behemoth had to use Absolute Strength to match Truth Listener’s physical toughness.</p>
<p>Truth Listener’s speed was already very fast. It was considered one of the best at the Mythical stage, but it was still slightly inferior to the golden-winged bird.</p>
<p>The golden-winged bird constantly flashed about and attacked Truth Listener, causing it to be overwhelmed. Truth Listener, who was originally extremely agile, appeared somewhat clumsy in front of the golden-winged bird. Its body was constantly being attacked by the bird’s wings and claws. Although it wasn’t severely injured, it made Truth Listener, who was already in an abnormal state of mind, become increasingly irritable.</p>
<p>However, what delighted Zhou Wen was that although Truth Listener couldn’t touch the golden-winged bird, it wasn’t anywhere close to being killed. It managed to stabilize the situation for the time being.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Tyrant Behemoth and saw that it was also suppressed by the monk-robed skeleton. Without Absolute Strength, Tyrant Behemoth also lost its absolute dominance at the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>The situation had completely reversed; Zhou Wen’s pets were at a disadvantage. The situation was extremely bad.</p>
<p>What worried Zhou Wen the most was that even if they could finish off the skeleton and the golden-winged bird this time, what about the next time?</p>
<p>If Buddha Annihilation could revive them, no matter how powerful Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts were, they would still end up dying.</p>
<p>The only way was to kill Buddha Annihilation first.</p>
<p>The situation on Leng Zongzheng’s side wasn’t smooth. The Demonic Organ Throne’s strength clearly wasn’t able to completely suppress Buddha Annihilation. Otherwise, Buddha Annihilation wouldn’t have the time to revive the monk-robed skeleton and the golden-winged bird.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and flapped his wings as he flew into the sky. He wanted to see if he could help Leng Zongzheng destroy Buddha Annihilation.</p>
<h3 id='chapter688'>Chapter 688: Rampage</h3>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen approached the battlefield, he immediately felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Looking from afar, he felt that Leng Zongzheng was playing the organ while Buddha Annihilation was listening to his organ music.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen entered a certain range, what he saw was completely different. Leng Zongzheng’s Demonic Organ Throne had turned into a terrifying demonic castle.</p>
<p>With Leng Zongzheng’s organ music, demons flew out of the demonic castle one after another, circling around Buddha Annihilation as though they were trying to lure him into the castle.</p>
<p>Buddha Annihilation was surrounded by demons as he looked down. He held the Buddha beads in his hand and chanted scriptures. The Buddhistic glow on his body bloomed like a lotus flower, resisting the temptation of the demons.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only took a glance from afar and it was enough to make his heart tremble. He couldn’t help but have the urge to throw himself into the devil’s embrace—the urge to dance with the devil.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat as he hurriedly composed himself and eliminated the distracting thoughts.</p>
<p>His willpower was firm to begin with. Once he entered a focused state, he immediately felt the illusions vanish. There were no demons or the demonic castle, nor were there any Buddhistic glow or lotus flowers. All he saw was Leng Zongzheng playing the organ while Buddha Annihilation listened.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t continue walking forward. He felt that what he had just seen wasn’t as simple as an illusion. It was so far away that it made him hallucinate. If he really entered, Zhou Wen might not be able to withstand it with his Epic body.</p>
<p>If he didn’t end up helping and ended up being killed by friendly fire, that would be a tragic death.</p>
<p>If I could advance to the Mythical stage myself, I wouldn’t have so many reservations. I wouldn’t need to rely solely on my Companion Beasts to fight. Zhou Wen had the intention to advance to the Mythical stage, but he had no clue how.</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng and Jiang Yan had advanced to the Mythical stage by contracting with Guardians. Zhou Wen didn’t wish to take this path.</p>
<p>This path seemed to be the simplest, but the disadvantages were too great. It was impossible for him to fuse with the Guardian during his daily life. If he encountered any sudden danger, he might die without even having the chance to fuse.</p>
<p>Do I really have to use Spirit Casting? Zhou Wen was considering if he should take Wang Mingyuan’s path.</p>
<p>Although the path was difficult, it was a true advancement to the Mythical stage. However, one’s body would no longer resemble that of a human. It was closer to a dimensional creature, and he might even be rejected by humans.</p>
<p>It’s really a dilemma. It’s better I first advance my Life Soul to the Perfect Body and see if there’s a third option. These thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind. Since he couldn’t help Leng Zongzheng, Zhou Wen planned on returning to deal with the monk-robed skeleton and the golden-winged bird.</p>
<p>Without the crystal, the monk-clothed skeleton’s strength had decreased significantly. However, the crystal was ultimately an external force. The monk-clothed skeleton’s Wheel of Destiny’s strength was still present. Compared to Tyrant Behemoth, it had the advantage. Tyrant Behemoth was suppressed by the monk-clothed skeleton in a frontal collision.</p>
<p>However, Tyrant Behemoth was just too ferocious. Even though it was suppressed, it still attacked without fear of death and caused trouble for the monk-clothed skeleton. Even if it was injured, it wouldn’t be in any serious danger for the time being.</p>
<p>Furthermore, An Sheng and the Azure Rainbow Flying Sword were constantly harassing it, giving the monk-robed skeleton a headache. It was unlikely that there would be any problems anytime soon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the golden-winged bird and Truth Listener again. Truth Listener looked a little pathetic. It resembled a clumsy bear. The golden-winged bird made it go in circles, but it ultimately failed to touch the golden-winged bird. Instead, it had many wounds on its body—all inflicted by the golden-winged bird. Although they were minor injuries, Truth Listener nearly went berserk.</p>
<p>The golden-winged bird’s speed is too fast. How can I help Truth Listener? With my speed, I definitely won’t be able to catch up to it. Even if it has powerful offensive powers, it won’t be of much use against it. Should I use the Great Might Vajra Bull’s Soul Suppression Bell? However, the Soul Suppression Bell is an area-of-effect attack. It affects both the enemy and me. If the golden-winged bird and Truth Listener were to faint together, that doesn’t seem to be of much help to the battle… As Zhou Wen was thinking about how to help Truth Listener, he saw the enraged Truth Listener shatter another earring.</p>
<p>As the earring shattered, Truth Listener’s body underwent a strange change. This time, it didn’t grow bigger, but the first scale on its body vaguely produced strange black symbols. The symbols burned with black flames, like the devil’s mark from hell.</p>
<p>Due to the appearance of the symbol, Truth Listener’s dark golden body seemed to become dark. Under the envelopment of the black flames, coupled with its ferocious and violent eyes, it was like a demonic beast that had rushed out of hell.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could sense that Truth Listener’s emotions had become even more irritable and unstable. It was showing signs of madness, making Zhou Wen almost unable to sense the soul connection between them.</p>
<p>The golden-winged bird once again flashed past Truth Listener’s side, but this time, Truth Listener’s claw grabbed the golden-winged bird’s leg.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Truth Listener exerted strength in its arm and pulled the golden-winged bird down from the sky. It slammed heavily onto the ground, creating a huge crater in the golden ground.</p>
<p>Then, Truth Listener grabbed the golden-winged bird’s legs with both claws and let out a violent roar. It suddenly exerted strength and was about to rip the golden-winged bird into two.</p>
<p>The golden-winged bird’s body shimmered with golden light as its legs were torn apart. The mysterious symbol on its feathers kept trembling. It turned its head in horror and pecked Truth Listener.</p>
<p>However, Truth Listener ignored it. It allowed the golden-winged bird to tear apart the scales on its head. Blood gushed out, but it didn’t seem to notice it. It continued tearing at the golden-winged bird’s legs.</p>
<p>The golden light shattered as blood flowed out. The golden-winged bird let out a tragic cry as one of its legs was ripped off by Truth Listener. It struggled even more violently as it used its wings to strike Truth Listener’s head.</p>
<p>Truth Listener ignored it. It threw away the bird leg in its hand and grabbed one of its wings with one hand and the other leg with another before tearing it apart.</p>
<p>Golden blood splattered onto the feathers. The golden-winged bird let out a heart-wrenching cry, but it was useless.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the golden-winged bird in horror. It had its wings and legs torn off by Truth Listener. In the end, it even ripped off its head and threw it to the ground.</p>
<p>Truth Listener roared at the sky like a bloodthirsty demon king from hell.</p>
<p>An Sheng was already dumbfounded. This was the first time he had seen such a ruthless and ferocious Companion Beast. It wasn’t a massacre, but torture.</p>
<p>Ignoring Companion Beasts, even dimensional creatures seldom had such ferocious tendencies.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen himself wore a look of shock. He had only seen one of Truth Listener’s earrings shatter in the past. It was so ferocious and ruthless now that two earrings had shattered. If the six earrings were to shatter together, he didn’t know how terrifying it would be.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t attempt it, nor did he wish to try. He felt that the connection between him and Truth Listener had become extremely weak. It was like a taut fishing line that could snap at any moment.</p>
<p>He attempted to summon Truth Listener back. Thankfully, Truth Listener sensed Zhou Wen’s will and its emotions slowly stabilized. The shattered earring returned to its ears. When Truth Listener returned to Zhou Wen’s ear, the violent emotions vanished.</p>
<h3 id='chapter689'>Chapter 689: Invisible Fire</h3>
<p>Thankfully, nothing happened. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief when he felt Truth Listener’s emotions slowly calm down.</p>
<p>Every time Truth Listener’s earring shattered, it gave Zhou Wen an ominous feeling. If not for the fact that he had no choice, Zhou Wen wouldn’t be willing to let Truth Listener shatter the earring to fight.</p>
<p>However, in this situation, there was nothing else he could do. Zhou Wen had already used all the combat strength he could muster, so there was no way he could hold back.</p>
<p>With the golden-winged bird dead, Zhou Wen no longer had any worries. Unfortunately, he didn’t discover any Companion Eggs or dimensional crystals.</p>
<p>Gripping the Golden Overlord Sword tightly, Zhou Wen charged at the monk-robed skeleton. At the same time, he summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull and used the Soul Suppression Bell as support to attack the monk-robed skeleton.</p>
<p>Without the help of the crystal, the monk-clothed skeleton’s strength decreased significantly. Under the siege, it was stunned by the Soul Suppression Bell. Zhou Wen took the opportunity to slash at it, slicing off one of its legs, causing its movement to slow down significantly.</p>
<p>An Sheng also took the opportunity to use the fixing incantation. Although it couldn’t completely freeze the skeleton’s body, it made it pause for a moment.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth’s body expanded as it used the Mountain Devouring Skill to swallow the monk-robed skeleton.</p>
<p>Knock! Knock! Knock!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw Tyrant Behemoth’s stomach twitch like a drum, but it didn’t last long.</p>
<p>It’s finally done! Zhou Wen didn’t dare relax as he turned to look at Buddha Annihilation. Indeed, he saw the Urna on his forehead glow once again. Immediately, another Buddhistic glow descended.</p>
<p>In the Buddhistic glow, the monk-robed skeleton and the golden-winged bird were born once again as their bodies gradually condensed.</p>
<p>Although he had expected it, Zhou Wen’s expression was still ugly. He turned his head to look at the golden-winged bird’s corpse that he had just killed and saw that it was still scattered across the ground. It hadn’t disappeared.</p>
<p>Damn it. What kind of power does that Buddha Annihilation’s Urna have to revive a Mythical creature out of thin air… Just as Zhou Wen was feeling depressed, something even more shocking happened.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the skeleton and the golden-winged bird that were reborn in the Buddhistic glow. The two Golden Battle God Halberds that were killed were in the lineup as well.</p>
<p>However, the two Golden Battle God Halberds that had been revived had no connection to Zhou Wen, much less be under his control.</p>
<p>They are both Guardians, so why is Buddha Annihilation so much stronger than the six-winged seraphim? What kind of ability is this? Could it be that any creature or Companion Beast that dies near him, can be revived and used by him? Zhou Wen guessed inwardly. If that’s the case, what’s the point of fighting? Just surrender and commit suicide. It’s impossible to win unless I kill Buddha Annihilation first.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat tempted. Thinking of such a bug-like ability, he felt quite delighted if he could obtain it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Buddha Annihilation might not be willing to contract with him. Even if it was willing, Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to do so.</p>
<p>His Companion Beast, Demonic Neonate, had signed a master-slave contract. If he signed a Guardian contract, wouldn’t that be too lame in comparison?</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen pondered over, the skeleton, the golden-winged bird, and the two Golden Battle God Halberds rushed over. It was obvious that the Golden Battle God Halberds were completely heartless and wanted to destroy Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to summon Truth Listener. He got it to remove the restrictions of one earring and continue fighting.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen faced the Golden Battle God Halberds himself. With his understanding of the Golden Battle God Halberds, he quickly used the Golden Overlord Sword to snap the two Golden Battle God Halberds.</p>
<p>Truth Listener was still fighting the golden-winged bird to the death. Tyrant Behemoth was dragging its exhausted body as it fought the monk-robed skeleton. An Sheng, the Azure Rainbow Flying Sword, and the bald parrot were all helping.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to rush forward to help, but he thought that even if he killed them, it would be useless. Buddha Annihilation would still revive them.</p>
<p>These revived Mythical creatures look no different from the former Mythical creatures or even Companion Beasts. Are they really identical to their original forms? Zhou Wen activated the Hell King’s Eye and glanced at the golden-winged bird and the monk-robed skeleton, hoping to see if he could discover any differences.</p>
<p>A vertical crack appeared on Zhou Wen’s glabella. It looked like a third eye, but there were no pupils in it. It was as though it was connected to hell as ghostly cries sounded.</p>
<p>Even with the Hell King’s Eye, he couldn’t tell how different these resurrected Mythical creatures were from their original bodies.</p>
<p>They looked no different from real creatures. They also had invisible flames on them, and they looked rather thick.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was observing, Truth Listener was already on the brink of going berserk.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and charged at the monk-robed skeleton. He planned on dealing with it before getting Tyrant Behemoth to help Truth Listener alleviate some of the pressure.</p>
<p>Where did Demonic Neonate go? Why haven’t I seen her attack? Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He sensed Demonic Neonate’s location and realized that she was hiding in a pile of ruins. She was secretly looking at Buddha Annihilation, who was sitting cross-legged in the sky.</p>
<p>So she’s targeting Buddha Annihilation? I wonder if it’s possible. Although Grim Demon is also a Guardian, it feels so weak. It feels weaker than the six-winged seraphim. Zhou Wen was somewhat worried.</p>
<p>If Demonic Neonate attacked Buddha Annihilation and ended up being killed by it, it would be a huge loss.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still optimistic about Demonic Neonate’s future. He had been waiting for the day she returned to the Mythical stage, so he was unwilling for her to risk her life.</p>
<p>If Grim Demon knew what Zhou Wen was thinking, he would probably vomit blood and faint in the bathroom.</p>
<p>Grim Demon wasn’t weak. It was only because it was limited by the master-slave contract. Furthermore, as the master, Demonic Neonate was too weak, which greatly reduced its combat strength. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be so weak.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen rushed forward to help Tyrant Behemoth fight and summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull and Torch Dragon to help. He wanted to kill the monk-robed skeleton as soon as possible.</p>
<p>While fighting, Zhou Wen kept his Hell King’s Eye open. He wanted to see if there was anything different between the monk-robed skeleton and the monk-robed skeleton that would be revived later.</p>
<p>Before Truth Listener went berserk again, Zhou Wen finally managed to kill the monk-robed skeleton. However, this time, Zhou Wen had cleaved apart the skeleton’s head with his sword.</p>
<p>At this moment, something strange happened. After the monk-robed skeleton was killed, the invisible flames on its body floated towards the Hell King’s Eye as though they were attracted by some force.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised, unsure if he had accidentally discovered the advancement method for Hell King.</p>
<p>The formless fire that resembled a stream of water was constantly sucked into the Hell King’s Eye. At the same time, Zhou Wen felt that his Hell King body was silently changing.</p>
<p>So Hell King evolves by absorbing these invisible flames? If I had known, I would have raised Hell King’s level a long time ago. Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<h3 id='chapter690'>Chapter 690: Resurrection No More</h3>
<p>With the monk-robed skeleton dead, Zhou Wen commanded Tyrant Behemoth to reinforce Truth Listener. The Companion Beasts and the others didn’t head over.</p>
<p>Apart from top-notch Companion Beasts with especially powerful bodies like Tyrant Behemoth and Truth Listener, the other creatures would die if they went up. The golden-winged bird’s speed was just too fast. One had to withstand its attacks head-on, but its attack power was especially powerful. Even ordinary Mythical Companion Beasts couldn’t withstand it.</p>
<p>With Tyrant Behemoth joining the fray, Truth Listener’s pressure decreased significantly, but the battle became even more intense.</p>
<p>It was similar to Truth Listener’s situation. Without the suppression of Absolute Strength, Tyrant Behemoth couldn’t touch the golden-winged bird. It was only an additional target to take a beating, sharing half the brunt of the firepower.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been using his mind to control Truth Listener, preventing it from shattering the second earring.</p>
<p>Firstly, it was easy to lose control when it was in its berserk state due to the shattering of the earring. Secondly, even if it killed the golden-winged bird, it would still be revived by Buddha Annihilation. It was useless to kill it. It was better to drag it out.</p>
<p>I’m really stupid. I should have thought of a way to kill the golden-winged bird first and leave behind the easier monk-robed skeleton. Zhou Wen suddenly realized that he had done something wrong.</p>
<p>“Chancellor Leng’s situation doesn’t seem too good,” An Sheng came to Zhou Wen’s side and said as he looked up into the sky.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could also tell that Leng Zongzheng’s situation wasn’t good. His Demonic Organ Throne had been unable to suppress Buddha Annihilation despite all this time. Under such circumstances, the party taking the initiative to attack would suffer.</p>
<p>Once the opponent found a chance to counterattack, Leng Zongzheng would be in danger.</p>
<p>“The battle between the two of them is almost at the peak of the Mythical stage. Our strength isn’t enough to interfere in the battle. Even if we rely on Companion Beasts to influence the direction of the battle, we need to find an appropriate opportunity.” Zhou Wen sighed and said, “If my Torch Dragon Youngling hadn’t expended too much energy, it might have the ability to forcefully change the battle’s trajectory, but it won’t work now.”</p>
<p>An Sheng smiled and said, “Young Master Wen, don’t worry. The quality and quantity of your Companion Beasts are enough to stand tall amongst the Federation. Even the people with the most Companion Beasts in the six hero families are probably inferior to you. If you can’t even leave this place, no one in the Federation will be able to.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that An Sheng was trying to relieve the pressure on him, so he said with a smile, “That’s not necessarily the case. At the very least, Primordial Sword Immortal and Death of the Underworld aren’t weaker on the rankings than my Behemoth.”</p>
<p>“Those kinds of Companion Beasts are rare even among the six families. Whoever has one is already considered extremely lucky. How could one have so many like you? Let me do a count. Torch Dragon, Behemoth, and that Companion Beast that looks like a golden ape. Ignoring the other ordinary Mythical creatures, you already have three top-notch Mythical creatures that can attempt first place. You can be considered unprecedented,” An Sheng sighed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head. Now, these top Companion Beasts weren’t able to help him rush out of the Buddhist kingdom. Life and death remained unknown.</p>
<p>Sometimes, miracles happen in this world.</p>
<p>Behemoth and Truth Listener couldn’t keep up with the golden-winged bird’s speed. They were originally getting beaten up, and Zhou Wen only wanted them to hold back the golden-winged bird.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Truth Listener had actually gotten lucky. It had accidentally caught the golden-winged bird’s wings when it was clawing wildly.</p>
<p>This surprise was unexpected to the golden-winged bird and Truth Listener. This was also a testament to the benefits of having low intelligence. Under the same circumstances, Truth Listener, who wasn’t intelligent, had a reaction that exceeded its brain. It instinctively grabbed the golden-winged bird’s wings and threw it over its shoulder, slamming it to the ground.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Having seized this opportunity, how could the two terrifying creatures give up? Behemoth sat on the golden-winged bird’s body and slammed its head. Truth Listener stood in front of the golden-winged bird and ripped off its wings.</p>
<p>The golden-winged bird had a huge advantage in speed, but its body wasn’t stronger than Truth Listener or Behemoth’s. Under the two beasts’ barrage of attacks, it was quickly killed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was chatting with An Sheng when he realized that it was too late to stop them from killing the golden-winged bird.</p>
<p>Seeing that the golden-winged bird’s head had been smashed in, it was no longer able to live.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to retrieve the golden-winged bird’s invisible flames using the Hell King’s Eye, but he realized that he couldn’t. After the golden-winged bird died, the invisible flames on its body automatically dissipated into the world.</p>
<p>Could it be that I have to kill a creature myself to absorb the invisible flames on its body? Zhou Wen guessed the reason.</p>
<p>Upon dying, Buddha Annihilation once again used its power to revive them.</p>
<p>The Buddhistic glow illuminated and purified the golden Buddha kingdom with no way of stopping it.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen thought he had to kill the monk-robed skeleton and the golden-winged bird again, he realized something strange.</p>
<p>The golden-winged bird and the two Golden Battle God Halberds were reborn, but the monk-robed skeleton didn’t reincarnate this time. It was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Strange, why hasn’t the monk-robed skeleton been reborn? Could it be that Buddha’s Annihilation’s strength is insufficient to revive the monk-robed skeleton? That’s not right. The golden-winged bird is even stronger than the monk-robed skeleton; yet, it can be revived. The two Golden Battle God Halberds can also be reborn. There’s no reason for the monk-robed skeleton to not have the strength to be reborn…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up as he suddenly thought of a possibility. Previously, when the monk-robed skeleton died, I used the Hell King’s Eye to absorb the invisible flames on its body. Could this be the reason why it couldn’t be reborn again?</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, look. That monk-robed skeleton didn’t revive this time. Did Buddha Annihilation expend too much of its energy and have no way of reviving the monk-robed skeleton?” An Sheng couldn’t see Zhou Wen absorbing the invisible flames with the Hell King’s Eye, so his conclusion was similar to Zhou Wen’s first thought.</p>
<p>“I think I might know how to prevent them from being revived,” Zhou Wen said as he impatiently charged at the two Golden Battle God Halberds.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth and Truth Listener also charged at the golden-winged bird and began their painful battle again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen opened the Hell King’s Eye and snapped the two Golden Battle God Halberds. At the same time, he absorbed the invisible flames from their bodies. This time, the process was very smooth. He absorbed all of them in one go.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t wait to know if they would revive later.</p>
<p>An Sheng seemed to sense something when he saw Zhou Wen slice through the Golden Battle God Halberd, but he didn’t know what Zhou Wen had done.</p>
<p>Be it the Hell King’s Eye or the invisible fire, they were invisible to the naked eye. An Sheng had no idea that Zhou Wen had absorbed the invisible fire with his Hell King’s Eye, so he naturally had no way of guessing.</p>
<p>Now, there’s only the golden-winged bird left. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull. He took the opportunity and made it use the Soul Suppression Bell, causing the golden-winged bird to instantly feel dizzy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to rush over, but to his surprise, Behemoth became dizzy but Truth Listener didn’t. It immediately grabbed the dizzy golden-winged bird.</p>
<p>Following that, it carried out another round of battery. The two monster-like Companion Beasts beat the golden-winged bird until it was half dead before Zhou Wen went up and killed it in one strike.</p>
<p>After absorbing the invisible flames from the golden-winged bird, Zhou Wen looked at Buddha Annihilation again.</p>
<p>However, this time, Buddha Annihilation didn’t use its resurrection ability. It appeared to be as Zhou Wen had expected. Buddha Annihilation’s resurrection wasn’t done without reason; it needed the invisible fire as its foundation. Now that the invisible fire was gone, Buddha Annihilation no longer had a target to use the skill.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, how did you do it?” An Sheng asked Zhou Wen in surprise.</p>
<h3 id='chapter691'>Chapter 691: Advancement Initiated</h3>
<p>“I just realized that there’s an Essence Energy Skill that can restrain them, preventing them from being revived,” Zhou Wen said as he looked at Leng Zongzheng and Buddha Annihilation in the sky.</p>
<p>He didn’t know music and didn’t know much about space. However, he had a nagging feeling that Leng Zongzheng’s organ music was weakening.</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng, do you know music? Do you know the extent of this song? Is it about to end?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>An Sheng understood Zhou Wen’s meaning and said with a heavy expression, “I only know a thing or two about music. However, I’ve heard from Overseer that Chancellor Leng’s Demonic Symphony has a total of seven movements. It should have reached the sixth movement. If this chapter can’t suppress Buddha Annihilation, I’m afraid the last movement will require him to go all out.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“No one knows what the last movement of the Demonic Symphony is. Everyone who has heard it is already dead. Overseer had only heard Chancellor Leng mention it. If the heart doesn’t die, the seventh movement won’t make a squeak,” An Sheng explained.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen heard that, he immediately knew that things weren’t looking good. Since the heart doesn’t die naturally, it meant that one still had the desire to live. If one’s heart died, they could even abandon their lives. The final movement’s dangers were obvious.</p>
<p>Now, Buddha Annihilation had already heard the end of the sixth movement, but he remained composed. Perhaps victory could only be determined by the seventh movement.</p>
<p>As the two of them spoke, the sixth movement came to an end. Although the first six musical movements had some ups and downs, in general, they were all gentle tunes that spurred one to improve themselves.</p>
<p>When the first note of the seventh movement sounded, everything changed.</p>
<p>The musical note seemed to have an irresistible charm. The moment it sounded, Zhou Wen and An Sheng felt an illusion appear in front of them.</p>
<p>The crumbling Buddhist kingdom seemed to have turned into hell. Death filled the air as countless vengeful souls extended their palms from underground and let out painful cries.</p>
<p>The Demonic Organ Throne in the sky didn’t change at all. It was still the Demonic Organ Throne, but Leng Zongzheng, who was sitting in front of the organ, emitted a terrifying demonic aura. He looked like a devil dressed in a suit. The demonic aura around him surged into the sky as his fingers danced. He pressed on the keys in a frenzy. His eyes were burning with zeal as he seemed to be possessed.</p>
<p>“The organ hasn’t changed, but the person has been possessed. This movement is too dangerous and evil.” Even Zhou Wen, who didn’t know music, couldn’t see the horror of Chancellor Leng’s movement.</p>
<p>In the past, it could be said that it was enticing one into entering a demonic state, but now, it was becoming one with the devil. The dangers involved only could be imagined.</p>
<p>Buddha Annihilation was still sitting cross-legged in the void. He closed his eyes and chanted. He held the Buddha beads with his fingers and emitted a supreme Buddhistic glow to block the terrifying demonic music.</p>
<p>However, when the seventh movement sounded, even Buddha Annihilation showed a change in expression. The Buddha beads in his hand scattered and fell into the void. The Buddha patterns on the Buddha beads revealed smiling faces. However, the smiles looked as ferocious as a devil’s smile. It was as crazy and evil as Leng Zongzheng’s expression.</p>
<p>Buddha Annihilation opened its eyes as the Urna on its forehead emitted a crystalline glow to resist the demonic music. On his body, black-red patterns that represented the devil appeared as they constantly spread across his body. The final target was the Urna.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and An Sheng felt their hearts tremble. They couldn’t help but be alarmed when they saw the demonic patterns on their bodies.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen… Quickly retreat…” An Sheng pulled Zhou Wen back.</p>
<p>The two of them retreated again and again before they felt much better. Zhou Wen used the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra to resist the hellish demonic music and it immediately had an effect. The demonic patterns on his body gradually receded.</p>
<p>An Sheng gradually returned to normal. The two of them looked at each other in horror. Despite being so far away, they were still affected. Buddha Annihilation, who faced Leng Zongzheng directly, experienced an indescribable pressure.</p>
<p>“Chancellor Leng is indeed worthy of being known as the strongest existence beneath the Mythical stage. Even Buddha can become a devil. I’m afraid there aren’t many people in the world who can withstand such organ music.” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but praise Leng Zongzheng, who was like a devil.</p>
<p>More and more demonic runes appeared on Buddha Annihilation’s body, almost covering his entire body. Only his Urna shone with a Buddhistic glow.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and An Sheng were nervous, but Leng Zongzheng’s organ music was getting crazier. They knew that it was probably the final critical moment.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the Urna between Buddha Annihilation’s eyebrows glowed brightly, illuminating the world like a sun.</p>
<p>“It’s coming!” Zhou Wen and An Sheng’s hearts were in their mouths. They knew that victory or defeat depended on this strike. Anyone who retreated would probably be severely injured.</p>
<p>At the instant Buddha Annihilation’s Urna released a blinding light, a dark purple beam of light silently passed through the hellish scene and stabbed into Buddha Annihilation’s back.</p>
<p>Buddha Annihilation’s pupils constricted as the Urna on his forehead dimmed. The demonic organ music immediately invaded his Urna.</p>
<p>A trace of black demonic aura appeared in the originally flawless Urna. Furthermore, wisps of the demonic aura continued to seep into it, weakening the Urna’s glow.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate! Zhou Wen immediately recognized the sword that had stabbed into the Buddha Annihilation’s back. It was the demonic sword in Demonic Neonate’s arms.</p>
<p>The demonic sword inched into Buddha Annihilation’s heart. With him severely injured and the invasion of the demonic music, the situation changed drastically.</p>
<p>As its Urna was gradually corroded by the demonic music, Buddha Annihilation’s peaceful face also began to distort. Red light flashed in its eyes as the Buddha-like face gradually turned devilish.</p>
<p>Buddha Annihilation stood up abruptly as the power in its body erupted like a volcano. It wanted to send the demonic sword on its back flying, but the demonic sword seemed to be nailed into its bones. Not only did it fail to send it flying away, it even stabbed into Buddha Annihilation’s heart at an even faster rate, piercing right through it.</p>
<p>If Buddha Annihilation could maintain its Buddhist nature, the demonic sword might not have been capable of penetrating its heart that easily. However, the moment it became demonized, Grim Demon on the sword played a significant role. It made Buddha Annihilation unable to put up a resistance.</p>
<p>Under the pincer attack of the demonic sword and the organ music, the extremely terrifying Guardian ultimately couldn’t withstand the attack. Its eyes gradually dimmed.</p>
<p>The Buddhistic glow on Buddha Annihilation’s body gradually extinguished. It also meant that his vitality was like a candle in the wind, about to extinguish at any moment.</p>
<p>Just as Buddha Annihilation was at the end of the ropes, its eyes regained clarity. The demonic patterns on its body gradually receded and it returned to its crystalline Buddha body. It sat down cross-legged and closed its eyes as it said slowly, “Annihilation of Buddha tonight is like the snuffing out of fire.”</p>
<p>With that sentence, the Buddha body burned like a piece of paper, turning to ash.</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhou Wen suddenly felt his Slaughterer Life Soul tremble as though an invisible force was injected into it, rapidly evolving it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed and delighted. He hadn’t been able to find an advancement method for Slaughterer, but now, it had inexplicably advanced.</p>
<h3 id='chapter692'>Chapter 692: Evolved Body</h3>
<p>With Buddha Annihilation dead, the Buddhist kingdom also collapsed. The Buddha statue completely shattered, turning into fragments that fell into the void. At the foundation of the Buddha, a stone door was revealed.</p>
<p>“The exit is there. Let’s go.” Leng Zongzheng led Zhou Wen and An Sheng towards the door.</p>
<p>When they went through the door, they realized that they were already outside the stone house. The stone house was wobbling and crumbling. Before long, it collapsed with a boom, reduced to a ruin.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the tiny pile of rocks and felt as though he was dreaming.</p>
<p>I’ve finally come out alive. Zhou Wen decided that he had to draw a few Substitute Talismans when he returned. No matter how low the success rate was, he had to draw them.</p>
<p>In the past, he had always gamed and seldom ventured into dimensional zones. Furthermore, he had plenty of Mythical Companion Beasts. With a Substitute Talisman and Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, he felt that it was enough to deal with any danger.</p>
<p>However, the battle in the Buddhist kingdom made Zhou Wen realize how terrifying the Guardians were. An uncontracted Buddha Annihilation was already this terrifying. It was probably more dangerous to encounter a contractor who already had an owner—as long as it wasn’t a rookie like John.</p>
<p>After the stone house collapsed, the phenomenon in Dragon Gate Grotto vanished and everything returned to normal.</p>
<p>However, problems with the Dragon Gate Grotto’s seal seemed to ensue after this. Often, some creatures would break out of the seal, making it much more frequent than before.</p>
<p>Thankfully, most of them were Malla or Fairies. Furthermore, there weren’t many of them. The troops stationed there could deal with them.</p>
<p>“Tianzuo, your family’s Little Zhou is indeed not bad. He’s worth grooming. You should spend more time on him,” Leng Zongzheng said to An Tianzuo before he left.</p>
<p>The corners of An Tianzuo’s eyes twitched, but he couldn’t retort his teacher. All he could do was lower his eyes and say yes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, Feng Qiuyan, and Li Xuan returned to their campus dorm and received a commendation. Feng Qiuyan and Li Xuan had fought with their lives on the line and killed many dimensional creatures. Although they didn’t kill any Mythical creatures, they won plenty of illustrious merits.</p>
<p>The military handed out medals to the students who had made contributions. However, An Tianzuo didn’t come. Qin Wufu handed out the medals on his behalf.</p>
<p>After Qin Wufu gave Zhou Wen the medal, he patted him on the shoulder and said, “Zhou Wen, if you wish to join the military, remember to come to me. There’s freedom with me. No one can control you.”</p>
<p>Qin Wufu’s words seemed to imply something, but Zhou Wen had no intention of joining the military at the moment. All he could do was give an excuse.</p>
<p>When he returned to his dorm, he realized that there were many messages on his phone. Some were from Wang Lu, some from The Thearch, and many from Lucas.</p>
<p>Wang Lu and Lucas had sent messages to ask Zhou Wen about the situation after hearing about the anomaly in Dragon Gate Grotto.</p>
<p>The Thearch asked Zhou Wen for any updates—if he was willing to accept her conditions.</p>
<p>He replied to the messages one by one. He didn’t receive a reply from The Thearch. Wang Lu and Lucas quickly replied and Zhou Wen explained his situation.</p>
<p>Only when he was free did Zhou Wen have the time to carefully observe Slaughterer.</p>
<p>After killing Buddha Annihilation, Slaughterer had automatically evolved. However, Slaughterer had always been mysterious. Zhou Wen’s connection with Slaughterer was somewhat odd—he knew very little about it.</p>
<p>He switched on his phone and switched to Slaughterer. Zhou Wen carefully studied Slaughterer’s information.</p>
<p>Slaughterer: Evolved Body</p>
<p>The information was simple, but it was equivalent to not saying anything. He only knew that he had advanced to an Evolved Body, but even the name hadn’t changed at all.</p>
<p>This was identical to the time when he condensed Slaughterer. Other Life Souls could be summoned to be used, but Slaughterer could only be used passively. It was completely different from the other Life Souls.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen later experimented with some of Slaughterer’s abilities, such as infinite Essence Energy recovery or stat strengthening.</p>
<p>Now that he had advanced to an Evolved Body, there was still no information. Zhou Wen could only figure it out himself.</p>
<p>After entering a game dungeon and switching to Slaughterer, Zhou Wen attempted to use all sorts of skills to fight dimensional creatures. He wanted to see what new capabilities Slaughterer’s Evolved Body had.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen realized that Slaughterer’s augmentation of his stats had increased significantly, and his Essence Energy recovery was faster. However, these were abilities that he already had in the past, so it wasn’t surprising for them to be enhanced.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me there’s no other ability? Zhou Wen attempted to communicate with Slaughterer, but unfortunately, just like before, Slaughterer didn’t respond. It was like a lifeless machine that clung to his body.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to not have any new abilities, right? Zhou Wen felt that it was definitely not that simple, but after trying for a long time, he failed to discover any extraordinary abilities.</p>
<p>I’ll test it out slowly in the future. Zhou Wen thought for a moment before switching to the Hell King Life Soul. He planned on grinding it to a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>He only needed to slay dimensional creatures to advance. The Hell King Life Soul was probably the easiest to advance.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to begin a massacre in-game, he suddenly realized that the Poison Bats in front of him didn’t have any invisible flames.</p>
<p>Why is this happening? Zhou Wen frowned and looked at the horde of Poison Bats. He realized that there were no invisible flames on them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen exited the dungeon and logged into a few more dungeons. The outcome was the same. None of the dimensional creatures in-game had invisible flames.</p>
<p>Could it be that there are no invisible flames because they are simulated creatures in-game? But that’s not right. If the creatures in-game are different from the creatures in real life, why would a Companion Beast that drops have the invisible flame? For instance, an existence like the Golden Battle God Halberd has the invisible flames? What’s the reason? Zhou Wen couldn’t understand the reason why and planned on heading to a dimensional zone in real life to take a look.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen planned on heading to Tiger Cage Pass. Every time he entered a dimensional zone in real life, something would happen, so he deliberately chose to head to Tiger Cage Pass.</p>
<p>Tiger Cage Pass’s final boss was the Elegant Emperor Puppet’s avatar. Zhou Wen could easily kill it now, so no matter what happened, it wouldn’t be too much for him.</p>
<p>I have to think of a way to get a Companion Beast that augments luck or good fortune to neutralize the bad luck I have. Otherwise, I have a nagging feeling that something will go wrong having Bamboo Blade, Tiger Soul General, and Tai Sui on me, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Since Tiger Cage Pass wasn’t too dangerous, Zhou Wen took the chick out with him to let it get some fresh air. It had been recently eating and sleeping all day in the dorm, making it look much fatter.</p>
<p>An Sheng got someone to deliver food to them every day, so the antelope and chick ate like kings.</p>
<p>The chubby chick stood on Zhou Wen’s shoulder with its round face. At a glance, it looked like an owl.</p>
<h3 id='chapter693'>Chapter 693: Guidance</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>On the way to Tiger Cage Pass, he encountered many students. Unlike before, many of them took the initiative to greet Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>In the past, due to Zhou Wen’s relationship with Wang Mingyuan and the problem with the bureau, many students weren’t willing to interact with Zhou Wen. They were afraid of being implicated.</p>
<p>Things were somewhat different now. The anomaly at Dragon Gate Grotto allowed many students to witness how terrifying break-out creatures were. At the same time, they deeply realized that only the strong could survive and protect the human cities in the future.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Wen, who had illustrious feats on the battlefield, many students had no choice but to reconsider their interactions with him.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen looked at them in a somewhat odd manner. It wasn’t because of their actions, but because he had activated his Eye of Hell and saw the invisible flames on them. It was as though he was looking at EXP treasures.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen’s mind was relatively normal. If he were Ják, he would have long culled them for the experience.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, what are you doing here?” Zhou Wen had just arrived at the entrance of Tiger Cage Pass when he saw Li Weiyang leading a group of girls outside.</p>
<p>“Senior Weiyang, I’m here to kill Demonized Generals,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>Li Weiyang joked, “Dear Almighty Zhou, shouldn’t you be killing Mythical creatures? Why are you here in Tiger Cage Pass to snatch the mere Demonized Soldiers and Demonized Generals from us? Is there any justice in this world?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what to say as Li Weiyang continued, “We also have to enter Tiger Cage Pass to kill Demonized Soldiers and Demonized Generals. These juniors aren’t experienced enough. Why don’t you join us? You can give the juniors a demonstration.”</p>
<p>Li Weiyang’s invitation didn’t conflict with Zhou Wen’s intentions, so he nodded and said, “Actually, killing ordinary Demonized Generals isn’t difficult. Previously, Li Xuan and I made a strategy. If one follows the strategy, they only need four or five at the Mortal stage to kill a Demonized General.”</p>
<p>“Senior, teach us please,” a female freshman said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The girls immediately turned rowdy, clamoring for Zhou Wen to teach them how to kill Demonized Generals.</p>
<p>“Of course.” Zhou Wen agreed readily. After all, his goal was to farm invisible flames. He wouldn’t waste much time teaching them.</p>
<p>The group of girls happily followed Zhou Wen into Tiger Cage Pass. Some of the girls even pulled him along and to teach them how to kill Demonized Soldiers.</p>
<p>Li Weiyang didn’t stop him. All she did was watch with a smile. However, she thought to herself, Do you little vixens really think that this is some treasured meat? If it was really a treasure, I would have called dibs long ago. Would you even have a chance? It’s just a piece of titanium-alloyed bone. Ignoring the possibility of eating it, just attempting to bite on it will spoil your teeth.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Indeed, as Li Weiyang had expected, the girls originally imagined that Zhou Wen would gently teach them. He might even hold their hands and teach them. This way, they could have some intimate contact with this famous senior. It might even lead to a romantic beginning.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen really started teaching them, they realized how ridiculously wrong they were.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen simply used the standards of a soldier on them. No, it should be said that he requested inhuman standards of them.</p>
<p>“That’s not right. Your foot has to stretch out three centimeters more. Lower your head a little more and punch with more strength. Can you not draw circles with your sword? Be more efficient. Why are you twisting your waist over there? Stand straight…” Zhou Wen spoke to them as though he was lecturing a recruit.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that there was nothing wrong with this. On the battlefield, a tiny mistake could cost them their lives. They needed to be absolutely correct.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if they wanted to kill a Legendary Demonized General at the Mortal stage, they needed to be precise in everything. Otherwise, problems would easily arise.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had taught them according to the standards he had been shown during his practices with Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan. He had even lowered his standards to the minimum.</p>
<p>Even so, they failed to meet the requirements. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown.</p>
<p>The girls realized that this was different from what they had imagined. They originally thought that it would be a pleasant interaction with their senior, but they ended up being treated as animals.</p>
<p>Seeing many girls leave silently, Li Weiyang laughed inwardly. These girls have finally seen how clueless a man can be.</p>
<p>Sometime into Zhou Wen’s lesson, he realized that the number of girls who listened to his explanations and guidance was decreasing. Furthermore, they were all over the place. They couldn’t meet his standards.</p>
<p>However, there was a first-year junior who surprised Zhou Wen. She had meticulously completed all the techniques that Zhou Wen had taught. Although there were some mistakes, she was much better than the other girls.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the junior was rather talented. She seemed to realize her mistakes and would fix many of them in her next practice.</p>
<p>“Senior, can I kill a Demonized General alone at the Mortal stage?” The other girls had already distanced themselves from Zhou Wen, but this girl took the initiative to ask him.</p>
<p>“It’s not impossible. Show me what you’ve learned.” Zhou Wen felt that the girl was rather talented and hardworking. He wasn’t stingy with teaching this junior.</p>
<p>The girl showed Zhou Wen what she had learned. Although Zhou Wen saw that she hadn’t learned any Essence Energy Skills, her basics were very solid. It was obvious that she had worked hard and was an all-rounder.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but recall the time he cultivated Ascetic Meditation. Like the girl, he had been silently cultivating, doing his best to do what he could.</p>
<p>“With your present skills, it’s a little difficult to kill a Demonized General. I can slightly change your movement technique’s positioning. That might allow you to kill a Demonized General. However, before that, you still need to train your strength. Your present strength isn’t enough. Furthermore, this will require a lot of practice and actual combat. It’s not something that can be done in a short period of time,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“If it’s not troublesome, can you teach me? If it’s too troublesome, forget it,” the girl asked in embarrassment.</p>
<p>“It’s not troublesome.” Zhou Wen explained how to change her movement technique.</p>
<p>In fact, it was just adding some basic techniques of Transcendent Flying Immortal. Zhou Wen demonstrated it once and guided the girl several times.</p>
<p>Li Weiyang couldn’t help but be surprised when she saw the girl learning from Zhou Wen. It was really surprising that there was a girl who wasn’t frightened away by him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen guided the girl a few times and when he saw that she wasn’t making any more mistakes, he said to her, “Your movement is right, but you need to spend time practicing. When you can use it freely in battle, along with a raise of your strength, you can kill a Demonized General alone.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Senior. I know what to do.” After thanking him, the girl went to the side to silently practice.</p>
<p>Seeing that no more girls were asking him for advice, Zhou Wen began his Hell King advancement plan.</p>
<p>The Demonized Soldiers in reality were no different from the Demonized Soldiers in-game. However, these Demonized Soldiers had the invisible flames on their bodies.</p>
<h3 id='chapter694'>Chapter 694: Holy Hell King</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>When Zhou Wen drew his saber to kill the Demonized Soldiers and Demonized Generals, the girl watched from the side as though she was observing Zhou Wen’s movement technique. Then, she compared it to her own movement technique and continued practicing.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen killed the Demonized Soldiers, invisible flames were immediately sucked into the Hell King’s Eye. However, the quantity was lacking. It was much less than the invisible flames he had obtained from killing the monk-robed skeleton and the golden-winged bird. It was like the difference between a drop of water and a pool of water.</p>
<p>However, a tower could be formed simply by piling sand. By killing more Demonized Soldiers and Demonized Generals, he could accumulate a significant amount of invisible flames.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because he had obtained a lot of invisible flames from before, Zhou Wen felt his body begin to undergo a strange change after killing a few Demonized Soldiers.</p>
<p>Invisible flames flowed out of the Hell King’s Eye, enveloping his body in invisible flames. Under the baptism of the invisible flames, the Hell King Life Soul underwent a complete transformation.</p>
<p>However, the invisible flames couldn’t be seen. The students nearby couldn’t tell the changes in Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>The Hell King Life Soul was Zhou Wen’s body. When the Hell King Life Soul evolved, Zhou Wen’s body also changed.</p>
<p>His body became extremely sensitive. Zhou Wen could even sense a speck of dust landing on him, and this level of spiritual perception and touch made him feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>This feeling wasn’t very good because the air was filled with dust and bacteria. It was fine back when he couldn’t feel or see them.</p>
<p>But now, he could only watch as the dust landed on his face, eyes, and even on his lips. There were also the worm-like bacteria. As they entered Zhou Wen’s nose and mouth through his breathing, he felt terrible.</p>
<p>The invisible flames couldn’t injure any creature, nor could it stop anything from approaching Zhou Wen. The invisible flames didn’t seem to exist at all.</p>
<p>However, it made Zhou Wen’s Hell King Life Soul become stronger and stronger. Finally, even the Hell King’s Eye changed.</p>
<p>In the past, the Hell King’s Eye was only a spatial rift. There was no pupil inside, but as the Hell King’s Life Soul transformed, a pupil-like bead gradually condensed in the Hell King’s Eye.</p>
<p>The bead was condensed from invisible flames. It was formless and corporeal, making it look extremely strange. It was like a transparent pupil that floated in the Hell King’s Eye.</p>
<p>Finally, the Hell King Life Soul completed its evolution. The Hell King’s Eye also had a transparent pupil. The pupil burned with invisible flames, making it look strange and mysterious.</p>
<p>The invisible flames on his body subsided as some mysterious information surged into Zhou Wen’s mind, allowing him to gain some information regarding the evolution of the Hell King Life Soul.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen still switched on his phone and read the blood-colored avatar’s information.</p>
<p>Holy Hell King (Evolved Body): The King of Hell who cleanses away sin.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen roughly knew that the Hell King’s Eye had the effect of cleansing sin, but he still needed to give it a try to know its exact power.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gave it a try to see how powerful the upgraded Holy Hell King was.</p>
<p>He looked at a Demonized Soldier with the Hell King’s Eye. The invisible karmic sinflames in his eyes immediately burned.</p>
<p>The invisible karmic flames on the Demonized Soldier’s body were triggered. It burst into flames as the invisible karmic sinflames on its body became even thicker.</p>
<p>It looked very powerful. The invisible karmic flames on the Demon Soldier’s body grew thicker, but they didn’t seem to affect the Demonized Soldier at all.</p>
<p>The Demonized Soldier looked normal. It didn’t seem to hurt in any spot. It didn’t even blink.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, how can it be useless? Could it be that the Demonized Soldier has already been secretly injured and will die after taking seven steps? Zhou Wen stared at the Demonized Soldier for a while to see if it would suddenly collapse.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen watched, he counted the Demonized Soldier’s steps. One step… Two steps… Three steps…</p>
<p>He watched as the Demonized Soldier finished seven steps. Suddenly, the Demonized Soldier’s body paused.</p>
<p>No way! I actually guessed right. It’ll die in seven steps? Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, the Demonized Soldier stopped and farted before continuing to wander.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s face immediately darkened. Without any hesitation, he killed the Demonized Soldier with one strike and swallowed the invisible flames on its body.</p>
<p>What the hell. After all this trouble, this Holy Hell King’s ability is useless, Zhou Wen thought gloomily.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen knew that the Eye of the Holy Hell King was definitely useful, it didn’t seem to be suitable for mainstream use. He didn’t know what its exact use was.</p>
<p>Forget it. I’ll continue absorbing the invisible flames. I’ll advance the Hell King to a Perfect Body first. Zhou Wen continued killing monsters to obtain the invisible flames.</p>
<p>For the next few days, Zhou Wen absorbed the invisible karmic flames at Tiger Cage Pass. Finally, he charged into Tiger Cage Pass and killed the Tiger Cage Demonized General and the Elegant Emperor’s Avatar Puppet.</p>
<p>However, the invisible karmic flames that these Demonized Soldiers and Demonized Generals could provide were far inferior to the monk-robed skeleton and the golden-winged bird. Despite Zhou Wen absorbing so much, the Holy Hell King didn’t react at all. It showed no signs of advancement again.</p>
<p>Reality wasn’t a game. After killing the Demonized Soldiers and Demonized Generals inside, he had no choice but to slowly wait for new Demonized Soldiers and Demonized Generals to come out of the dimensional rift. He didn’t know how many days he would have to wait, so Zhou Wen naturally wanted to head out. He planned on changing locations to continue grinding the invisible karmic sinflames.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to leave, he saw a female student enter deep inside Tiger Cage Pass and kill many Demonized Soldiers. Finally, she encountered a Demonized General and was fighting it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t pay her much attention and was about to leave when he realized that her movement technique looked familiar. He took a careful look.</p>
<p>He immediately realized that the girl was someone he knew. She was the female freshman who had come here with Li Weiyang a few days ago. Zhou Wen had even taught her some basic techniques of Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>After not seeing her for a few days, the girl had already mastered the techniques. She fought the Demonized General alone and used the techniques that Zhou Wen had taught her to constantly move about, preventing the Demonized General from touching her. Instead, she constantly injured it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, she was only at the Mortal stage. She didn’t even have a Companion Beast, nor did she learn any Essence Energy Skills. Every strike on the Demonized General only dealt limited damage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown slightly. He had told the girl that she lacked strength and needed to raise her strength to kill the Demonized General, but to his surprise, she had come alone.</p>
<p>She also knew that her attacks were lacking, so she wasn’t greedy. She wanted to cause severe damage by constantly accumulating damage.</p>
<p>However, she had neglected the fact that her Essence Energy and stamina were lacking. After a prolonged battle, her speed and strength declined.</p>
<p>Finally, the girl’s speed decreased drastically. She failed to dodge the Demonized General’s charge and was about to be hit.</p>
<h3 id='chapter695'>Chapter 695: Butterfly</h3>
<p>1</p>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>With a flash of the saber beam, the Demonized General was cleaved into two.</p>
<p>The girl barely survived. When she saw Zhou Wen beside the Demonized General, she revealed a look of pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you that you lack strength and that you need to raise your strength before you can attempt killing the Demonized General?” Zhou Wen said with a frown. He was a little angry and his tone was nasty.</p>
<p>The reason Zhou Wen was angry wasn’t that the girl hadn’t listened to him. In the event something happened to the girl, wasn’t he harming her by teaching those movement techniques?</p>
<p>When the girl heard Zhou Wen, she lowered her head and said uneasily, “I’m sorry. It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have ignored your advice.”</p>
<p>“It’s not that you let me down, but that you let yourself down. You were lucky that I happened to be here. You might not be so lucky next time,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Senior, don’t worry. There won’t be a next time,” the girl said seriously.</p>
<p>“That’s good. I’ll escort you back to prevent any accidents.” Zhou Wen walked out as the girl followed behind him.</p>
<p>“Your movement technique isn’t bad. Here are some movement technique notes. You can take a look. They should be of some help to you.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and handed a notebook to the girl.</p>
<p>They were some of the notes Zhou Wen had made when he first comprehended Transcendent Flying Immortal Skill. They were just random thoughts and techniques, nothing systematic.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen truly gained an epiphany, he didn’t use them again.</p>
<p>This girl was rather talented in movement techniques, and her personality was somewhat similar to Zhou Wen’s. Zhou Wen casually handed the notebook to her to see if she could figure out anything useful from his random thoughts and techniques. It all depended on her perceptivity.</p>
<p>“I… I don’t have money…” The girl shook her hand immediately.</p>
<p>“It’s not worth much. I just wrote it in passing. Just take a look. There’s no need to take it seriously.” Zhou Wen threw the notebook to the girl and left.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen returned to his dorm, he began studying which dimensional zone to continue grinding for invisible sinflames.</p>
<p>Although he already knew the method needed to advance Slaughterer, killing a Guardian to advance Slaughterer was just too difficult.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen already knew that he couldn’t beat the Guardian in Ant City.</p>
<p>He might not even be capable of killing the nine black dragons who pulled the wagon in the underground sea.</p>
<p>There was also another one—it was guarded by the chick’s mother. Ignoring the question of whether Zhou Wen could defeat it, even if he could, he didn’t think it was right to kill the chick’s mother.</p>
<p>Of course, he might not be its match in the first place.</p>
<p>After some thought, he realized that there was only one Guardian he could kill—Grim Demon who possessed the demonic sword.</p>
<p>Every time Grim Demon saw Zhou Wen, it felt that Zhou Wen was looking at him with a look resembling how a hungry wolf looked at a sheep. It made his heart tremble.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had the intention to kill Grim Demon in an attempt to advance Slaughterer to another level, Grim Demon was Demonic Neonate’s reserve rations. Zhou Wen couldn’t bring himself to do the deed, so he could only give up.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Demonic Neonate’s successful sneak attack during the Buddha Annihilation battle was all thanks to Grim Demon who was attached to the demonic sword. Otherwise, the ordinary demonic sword wouldn’t have been able to injure Buddha Annihilation, much less kill it.</p>
<p>If he killed Grim Demon, Demonic Neonate’s might would be greatly reduced. It didn’t seem worth it.</p>
<p>After much selection, Zhou Wen finally chose a dimensional zone that few people went to. It was the underground Pool City. In the past, Zhou Wen had farmed dimensional creatures like the Poison Wyrm. There were actually quite a number of dimensional creatures there, but because most of them were underwater and weren’t easy to kill, very few people went there.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen went to Pool City and grinded for a few days, but he didn’t make much progress. Typical dimensional creatures had very few invisible sinflames on them. Furthermore, after advancing to the Holy Hell King, the invisible sinflames he needed for another advancement seemed to increase significantly. He didn’t know how long it would take to advance Holy Hell King by killing ordinary dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Where can I kill a few dimensional creatures like the monk-robed skeleton and the golden-winged bird? Zhou Wen finally gave up on the idea of grinding ordinary dungeons to obtain the invisible sinflames.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen returned to his dorm and found Li Xuan sitting in the living room. Seeing Zhou Wen return, Li Xuan walked over with a smile and was about to put his hand on Zhou Wen’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Whoosh!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately placed the sheathed Bamboo Blade against Li Xuan’s neck. He asked coldly, “Who are you?”</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, are you crazy? Don’t you even recognize me?” As Li Xuan spoke, he was about to touch Zhou Wen’s forehead.</p>
<p>The Bamboo Blade in Zhou Wen’s hand slashed at Li Xuan’s neck.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Before the Bamboo Blade struck Li Xuan’s neck, white smoke emitted from his body, causing Zhou Wen’s Bamboo Blade to miss.</p>
<p>After the white smoke dissipated, he saw a woman standing there. She looked at Zhou Wen in surprise and said, “How did you discover that I’m not Li Xuan? I believe even Li Xuan himself wouldn’t be able to see through it.”</p>
<p>“I’ll give you one last chance. Who are you?” Zhou Wen stared coldly at the woman as he tightened his grip on the scabbard. He wouldn’t use a sheathed saber for the next strike.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had not noticed any flaws. The woman impersonating Li Xuan was indeed enough to make it look real. Even if she was placed beside the real Li Xuan, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have been able to tell which was real and which was fake.</p>
<p>However, women shouldn’t have come here. This was because Li Xuan didn’t dare enter his dorm randomly when Zhou Wen wasn’t around, much less sit on the sofa so daringly.</p>
<p>This was because Li Xuan knew very well that it was the antelope’s territory. What he was most afraid of was the antelope. Every time he came, he would only sit on a small sofa or a stool.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen only needed a glance to know that this Li Xuan was fake.</p>
<p>“My name is Butterfly. I’m Second Young Master Li Mobai’s servant. Master wants me to invite you over,” the woman said.</p>
<p>“Is this your idea of an invitation?” Zhou Wen said with a cold expression.</p>
<p>“That’s because the Master said that I definitely can’t fool you. I didn’t believe it, so I made a bet with him. Now that I’ve lost, you can kill me now if you’re not satisfied. I have no complaints,” Butterfly closed her eyes and said.</p>
<p>“Why is Li Mobai looking for me?” Zhou Wen didn’t have the habit of killing. Furthermore, he actually knew of Butterfly. When Li Xuan told him about Li Mobai and the Evil King Gu, he had told him about this woman.</p>
<p>Li Weiyang couldn’t tell even when Butterfly pretended to be Li Weiyang. He had nearly lost his will to live because of her ruse.</p>
<p>“Master has something important to discuss with you,” Butterfly said.</p>
<p>“Not interested. Leave,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“As the Master expected. However, Master got me to ask you if you are interested in Guardians? If you are interested, he will wait for you at Elegant Peace Restaurant,” Butterfly said.</p>
<h3 id='chapter696'>Chapter 696: Li Mobai’s Information</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>In a private room at Elegant Peace Restaurant.</p>
<p>“After you.” Li Mobai carefully brewed a cup of tea and placed it in front of Zhou Wen, gesturing for him to drink it.</p>
<p>“Just say it directly,” Zhou Wen said to Li Mobai without drinking it.</p>
<p>Li Mobai didn’t mind. As he continued brewing tea, he said, “Zhou Wen, do you know what the most terrifying power in this world is?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>Li Mobai continued, “The most terrifying power in this world is to be able to see something but not be able to obtain it. For example, having an enemy who killed your father and stole your wife right in front of you. You can see him every day. You can see him smile, watch him go crazy, and watch him enjoy all the riches and glory in the world. However, you can’t hurt even a single strand of his hair. This is more unbearable than any physical pain.”</p>
<p>“Second Young Master, I’m an ordinary student. I don’t understand such profound principles. If you wish to discuss philosophy, I’m afraid you’ve found the wrong person,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Li Mobai brewed a cup of tea for himself and took a sip before pouring away the remaining tea.</p>
<p>“Now, there are two things I can see but can’t obtain. One thing is the life of my enemy, and the other is a cocoon.” Li Mobai put down his cup and continued, “Ever since John challenged you with the six-winged seraphim, I’ve been trying my best to figure out what kind of power it is. In the end, I managed to find the answer, the cocoon of a Guardian.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen silently waited for Li Mobai to continue. Li Mobai definitely didn’t invite him here to talk about this.</p>
<p>“Perhaps the heavens pitied a half-crippled person like me and allowed me to find a Guardian cocoon. However, there are terrifying Mythical creatures guarding it. I spent a lot of effort and paid a huge price, but I failed to even approach it.” Li Mobai looked at Zhou Wen and said, “But you are different. You have the ability to help me approach it.”</p>
<p>“Why should I help you?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Because you can bet on a one-third possibility,” Li Mobai said with a smile.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen didn’t understand what Li Mobai meant.</p>
<p>“According to what I know, a Guardian like the six-winged seraphim wouldn’t casually reach an agreement with a human. Instead, it depends on whether that person manages to obtain their recognition. I know where the Guardian cocoon is, and you have the ability to get us near it. Each of us will have one chance. I’ll have a go first. If I don’t succeed, it will be your chance. Of course, it’s also possible that we won’t be able to obtain its recognition, but you have at least a one-third chance, right?” Li Mobai said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen fell silent. He was naturally interested in the Guardian cocoon. Not only was he interested, but he also wished he could immediately find one.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t want to obtain the Guardian’s recognition, but to kill it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen knew very well that every Guardian had terrifying strength. They were top-notch existences among Mythical creatures. He didn’t know if his strength could kill the Guardian.</p>
<p>Li Mobai continued, “The Guardian cocoon I discovered is in the South District. It’s where I obtained my Essence Energy Art. According to my speculation, since I could obtain the Essence Energy Art there and condense the Evil King Gu Life Soul, perhaps it might be compatible with the Guardian cocoon, elevating my chances of success. Unfortunately, my foundation has been destroyed and I’ve already cultivated another Essence Energy Art. This is also where I’m at a disadvantage. In short, my chances are very high. It’s not like you don’t have a chance. Do you want to take a gamble? The decision lies with you.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you afraid that I’ll snatch your chance?” Zhou Wen said to Li Mobai.</p>
<p>Li Mobai laughed. “Just as I said, I can’t do anything while watching my enemy live a carefree life. Now, I’m living a life worse than death. If it were you, would you be willing to take the risk?”</p>
<p>“I need time to consider it,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“That’s fine. You can take your time to consider it. I can wait.” Li Mobai said to Butterfly, “Take Zhou Wen back.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need. I can go myself.” Zhou Wen got up and left Elegant Peace Restaurant.</p>
<p>On the way back, Zhou Wen kept considering the proposal.</p>
<p>A Guardian cocoon was difficult to find. If what Li Mobai said was true, it was worth taking a look. Li Mobai had a chance, but he might not succeed.</p>
<p>However, Li Mobai was someone who could do anything for revenge. Zhou Wen didn’t dare trust him.</p>
<p>When he returned to school, he realized that An Sheng was waiting for him outside.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, the selection of treasure chests in the maze has been prepared. When do you plan on going?” An Sheng directly explained his intentions.</p>
<p>“Let’s do it now.” Zhou Wen also wanted to resolve this matter as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The world was changing at an increasing pace. Who knew if there would be a chance to go in the future? It was best to go early before the dimensional zone’s seals completely collapsed.</p>
<p>“I share the same thoughts. Get in.” An Sheng opened the car door and let Zhou Wen in before taking the driver’s seat.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, why did Li Mobai want to see you?” An Sheng clearly knew that Li Mobai had met Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t hide it as he recounted the matter.</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng, there’s something I don’t quite understand. Why did Chancellor Leng kill Buddha Annihilation and not choose to attempt a contract?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I’m not too sure about that. I’m afraid only Chancellor Leng can answer you.” An Sheng shook his head.</p>
<p>After a pause, An Sheng continued, “What Li Mobai said might be true, but it’s probably too late to go now.”</p>
<p>“Why do you say that?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>“According to reliable intelligence, Zhang Chunqiu, Xia Liuchuan, and Dugu Ge have gone to the South District together. Furthermore, their target is a Guardian egg. The place they’ve gone to is very close to the region Li Mobai mentioned,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Li Mobai didn’t say where the Guardian egg is. How do you know where it is?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“The An family has naturally been secretly paying attention to people like Li Mobai. He used to stay in the South District for a period of time. We’ve checked the areas he has been to and can determine a general area,” An Sheng explained.</p>
<p>“I see. That’s a pity.” Zhou Wen was originally tempted, but after hearing An Sheng’s words, he felt that his hopes were most likely dashed.</p>
<p>The roads these days were difficult to navigate. An Sheng stopped the car inside a service station before the two of them rode their Companion Beasts forward.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen rode the Great Might Vajra Bull as though he was walking on flat ground in the forest. His speed wasn’t slower than driving.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, you have to memorize the map of the maze. Although I’ll lead the way for you, you’ll have to come out by yourself if you get lost inside,” An Sheng exhorted Zhou Wen again.</p>
<h3 id='chapter697'>Chapter 697: Treasure</h3>
<p>The maze map was very complicated. Even with Zhou Wen’s memory, it took him a long time to memorize it.</p>
<p>Apart from the maze being overly complicated, it was also because the maze was constantly changing. The degree of change was so complicated that it far exceeded the limits of what ordinary humans could imagine.</p>
<p>Memorizing the map didn’t only require memorizing the routes, but it also required some formulas. When one really got lost, one didn’t have to rely on their brains’ memory of the routes. Instead, one had to use formulas to calculate the way out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had spent quite a bit of time on this. To be safe, he had put in a lot of effort.</p>
<p>Two days later, Zhou Wen and An Sheng arrived at an inconspicuous field. It was originally a cornfield, but it was very remote. After the dimensional storms, there was an anomaly here.</p>
<p>The corn here grew extremely tall; each of them was as tall as a tree. The corn on them was golden and even bigger than a person’s head.</p>
<p>Furthermore, ever since the dimensional storms, the corn here hadn’t withered. They kept growing.</p>
<p>The entrance to the maze was in the cornfield. Back then, An Tianzuo and An Sheng had fled from a Mythical break-out creature. In their panic, they escaped into the cornfield and ended up falling into the maze. As a result, they escaped the calamity.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo obtained his first Mythical Companion Beast there.</p>
<p>An Sheng circled the cornfield for a while before finally finding a spot. He used a shovel to dig up the soil on the ground, revealing a metal plate.</p>
<p>He lifted the metal plate and revealed an ancient well.</p>
<p>An Sheng patted the soil in his hand and said, “Overseer and I disguised this place to prevent others from accidentally entering. Firstly, it was to prevent the treasure chests from being opened by others. Secondly, it was to prevent humans from entering. It’s impossible for people to come out of such a complicated maze. Death would be the only outcome in that event.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, you have to follow me closely after we go down. Don’t take the wrong path,” An Sheng exhorted before heading down the well.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed An Sheng down the ancient well. There was still water at the bottom. An Sheng dived down, and before long, there was a horizontal tunnel.</p>
<p>Soon, the two of them passed through the underwater tunnel and appeared in a squarish stone room.</p>
<p>An Sheng kept leading Zhou Wen through the stone room. Every stone room looked identical. There was almost no difference.</p>
<p>Every stone room had six exits in all directions—up, down, left, right, forward, and back. Ordinary people wouldn’t be able to walk far before getting lost.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the stone house here could move on its own. It made it even harder for ordinary people to leave.</p>
<p>The only thing worth rejoicing about was that there were no dimensional creatures in the maze. All they needed to do was identify the path and ensure that they didn’t get lost.</p>
<p>An Sheng kept walking and stopping, occasionally doing some calculations. After three or four hours, he finally found a treasure chest with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>This stone house was a little special because there was no exit at the bottom. There was a stone chest in its place.</p>
<p>It was different from the treasure chest inlaid with gold and silver that Zhou Wen imagined. It was an ordinary stone chest that didn’t look anything special.</p>
<p>“The treasure chests here are very strange. A person can only open three treasure chests. Once you open three, it will be difficult to touch any more, even if you use all your strength. According to our past experience, the treasure chests might be empty. There might also be Companion Eggs, dimensional crystals, and some strange items. They are all dimensional items,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked forward and held the lid of the treasure chest, lifting it up.</p>
<p>There was no golden light, nor was there any treasure aura. In the huge chest, there was only a palm-sized crystal hourglass.</p>
<p>“What’s this? What’s its use?” Zhou Wen took out the hourglass and sized it up.</p>
<p>The sand in the hourglass was slowly flowing from one end to the other.</p>
<p>The sand was a type of white sand, not common yellow sand. It looked even finer.</p>
<p>“It’s possible to obtain something strange in the treasure chest. It’s hard to tell if it’s of any use. Perhaps this hourglass will be of some use,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded and was about to put away the hourglass when he discovered something strange.</p>
<p>As he was about to put it in his backpack, Zhou Wen held the hourglass horizontally. Strangely, when the hourglass became horizontal, the sand didn’t stop flowing. It continued falling in another direction.</p>
<p>Strange! Zhou Wen picked up the hourglass and sized it up again. He saw that the sand was flowing horizontally, completely violating the laws of physics.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen overturned the hourglass. The sand that should have flowed down flowed upstream without any intention of falling. It looked extremely strange.</p>
<p>This hourglass sure is extraordinary! Zhou Wen fiddled with the hourglass curiously. No matter how he oriented the hourglass, the sand inside stubbornly flowed in the same direction.</p>
<p>However, other than that, there was nothing special about it. Zhou Wen injected his Essence Energy, but it didn’t affect the hourglass. It was as though it was an Essence Energy insulator.</p>
<p>Seeing that the hourglass didn’t have any special effects, Zhou Wen placed it in his backpack and continued searching for other treasure chests with An Sheng.</p>
<p>During the time they were here, the stone house’s location changed again. An Sheng kept calculating, and after doing so, he continued walking with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>After walking for about half an hour, Zhou Wen suddenly heard a “ding” that sounded like the notification of an electric oven.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and An Sheng jumped in fright before realizing that the sound came from the backpack.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen opened his backpack with a strange expression. There weren’t any mechanical objects inside, nor were there any clocks.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly realized that the sand in the hourglass had been completely emptied. All the sand had entered one chamber.</p>
<p>Could it be that the sound was produced by it? Zhou Wen felt that there was no other possibility.</p>
<p>He kept looking at it. Apart from the sand beginning to flow in reverse, nothing happened.</p>
<p>After putting the hourglass back into his backpack, the two of them continued walking. However, just as they stepped into the next stone house, they suddenly realized that a beam of light had lit up inside.</p>
<p>All the stone houses Zhou Wen and An Sheng had passed through previously were the same. They didn’t differ from one another, nor were there any carvings on the walls.</p>
<p>However, there was a mural that resembled a phoenix on the wall of the stone house. It was still emitting light as though it was about to come to life.</p>
<p>Just as the phoenix mural lit up, the tunnel in the stone house automatically sealed shut.</p>
<h3 id='chapter698'>Chapter 698: Magical Hourglass</h3>
<p>A petite fire phoenix flew down from the wall. With terrifying flames, it instantly turned the entire stone house into a sea of flames.</p>
<p>Despite wearing armor, the red-hot flames were still scorching hot.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth and swallowed the flames, along with the fire phoenix.</p>
<p>Although it was only for a short moment, An Sheng and Zhou Wen broke out into a cold sweat. White smoke was billowing from their armor. If it had been a little longer, their armor would have been burned red, and their flesh would have been cooked.</p>
<p>Once the fire phoenix died, the six doors automatically opened and returned to their previous state.</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng, did you encounter such a situation when you came before?” Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss and asked An Sheng.</p>
<p>“Never. Young Master Wen, do you think the fire phoenix from before has something to do with this hourglass?” As An Sheng spoke, he looked at the backpack that had been burned to a crisp. The things in the backpack had already been dropped across the ground. Many things had been destroyed, but the crystal hourglass remained intact. It lay horizontally on the ground, the sand still flowing.</p>
<p>“I also think it might be related. Nothing happened last time you came here, and nothing happened when we were walking. However, after the hourglass reversed, an incident occurred. Apart from it, I really can’t think of any other reason,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Let’s use our Companion Beasts to scout ahead and see if the other stone houses have the same problem.” As An Sheng spoke, he summoned a lion and let it enter the next room An Sheng planned on entering.</p>
<p>The moment the lion entered, the stone house suddenly sealed shut. Soon, An Sheng’s expression changed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Truth Listener’s powers to figure out what was happening next door, but he couldn’t hear anything. There seemed to be a force blocking Truth Listener from hearing past the stone house’s wall.</p>
<p>Soon, the tunnel door opened and the lion Companion Beast that had entered vanished. From the looks of it, it had been killed.</p>
<p>“These stone houses have indeed become a little strange. After my Companion Beast entered, it quickly had its connection with me severed. I couldn’t sense what happened inside either,” An Sheng said with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked in from the door, but he didn’t discover any murals in the stone house. It was no different from an ordinary stone house.</p>
<p>“If the changes in the maze are related to this crystal hourglass, do you think the maze will return to normal when we wait for the crystal hourglass’s sand to reverse?” Zhou Wen said as he looked at the hourglass in his hand.</p>
<p>“That’s very likely.” An Sheng stared at the sand in the hourglass and said, “From the speed at which the sand flows, it should reverse every hour. Let’s wait here for an hour.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen also felt that it was better to wait.</p>
<p>God knew what other strange things were in this maze. Although he had Mythical pets, his body was still at the Epic stage. If anything happened in such a small stone house, he might not be able to dodge it. It was useless no matter how strong his Companion Beasts were.</p>
<p>The two of them waited in the stone house as time ticked by. When the sand from the hourglass completely flowed out, they heard a chime that was identical to the sound they had heard previously.</p>
<p>In the next second, the sand in the hourglass began to flow in reverse.</p>
<p>“I’ll give it another try.” An Sheng summoned another Companion Beast and let it enter the room the lion had entered.</p>
<p>Indeed, the stone house’s passageway didn’t close this time. The Companion Beasts inside didn’t show any signs of trouble.</p>
<p>“We were right.” An Sheng carefully entered the room, but there weren’t any incidents.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen and An Sheng used their Companion Beasts as scouts and continued proceeding towards the next treasure chest in the maze. They passed many stone houses, but nothing happened.</p>
<p>When the hourglass reversed, the two of them stopped and didn’t continue advancing. They stayed in place for an hour, waiting for the hourglass to reverse again before continuing.</p>
<p>It was unknown what kind of relationship the hourglass had with the maze. It could actually control it. The situation inside the maze was completely different when the sand flowed in the different directions.</p>
<p>When he was forced to rest, Zhou Wen studied the hourglass. He wanted to see if he could control the flow of sand in the hourglass.</p>
<p>If he could control it, wouldn’t he be able to control this maze?</p>
<p>However, after studying it for quite some time, Zhou Wen didn’t discover how to control the hourglass. The main reason he didn’t dare act rashly was that he was afraid that he would damage the hourglass. That would only make things worse.</p>
<p>I’ll think of a way to study it after we leave. Zhou Wen temporarily gave up the idea of controlling it.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, I seem to have discovered something,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“What did you discover? Is it a secret regarding the maze?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“No.” An Sheng shook his head and said, “After so many experiences with you, I realized that as long as you enter a dimensional zone, it’s easy for unexpected things to happen…”</p>
<p>“Coincidence… It must be a coincidence…” Zhou Wen said firmly. Although he also felt that something would happen every time he entered a dimensional zone, he definitely wouldn’t admit that he was a jinx.</p>
<p>Even if there’s a problem, it’s definitely because of the Tiger Soul General, Bamboo Blade, and Tai Sui. It’s definitely not my problem, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>An Sheng laughed and said, “Actually, this isn’t bad either. At the very least, it won’t be that boring. It’s always so thrilling every time I enter a dimensional zone with you.”</p>
<p>“It really has nothing to do with me,” Zhou Wen said with a sullen expression.</p>
<p>The two of them kept walking and stopping. After traveling for more than thirty hours, they finally arrived at the room where the second treasure chest was.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, open it and take a look,” An Sheng said with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>“Do I really have to open it?” Zhou Wen asked, somewhat worried.</p>
<p>The crystal hourglass appeared in the first treasure chest. Who knew what was inside this chest.</p>
<p>It would be fine if a Companion Egg or dimensional crystal dropped, but if a bomb appeared and blasted them to death, it would be terrible.</p>
<p>Although it was just an analogy, Zhou Wen couldn’t rule out the possibility of a bomb inside.</p>
<p>“Open it. Even if there’s a Buddha Annihilation inside, we can just fight it again. There’s nothing to be afraid of,” An Sheng said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen swallowed his saliva and reached out to lift the lid of the treasure chest. His heart was beating rapidly like a drum.</p>
<p>An Sheng and Zhou Wen looked into the treasure chest and were taken aback.</p>
<p>There was actually another chest in the treasure chest. The material and style were the same as the treasure chest, but it was a little smaller.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned slightly as he opened the lid. He saw that there was an even smaller treasure chest inside. After opening seven or eight treasure chests, all he saw were even smaller ones.</p>
<h3 id='chapter699'>Chapter 699: Strange Treasure Chest</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Are you kidding me? Don’t tell me that it will be an empty box in the end?” Zhou Wen said gloomily.</p>
<p>An Sheng laughed. “As expected of Young Master Wen. The Overseer and I opened six treasure chests, but none of them were as interesting as a single one of yours.”</p>
<p>“This really has nothing to do with me. You were the ones who picked the good treasure chests. The remaining treasure chests are all so strange,” Zhou Wen said gloomily.</p>
<p>“Quickly open it and take a look. I’m really looking forward to seeing what’s inside,” An Sheng urged.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to continue opening the treasure chests. One after another, he opened at least twenty. The treasure chest also changed from a huge chest to a tiny chest the size of a palm.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried and wanted to take out the treasure chest, but although it was tiny, it remained motionless no matter how hard he tried.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to continue opening them chest after chest The treasure chest had already become the size of a finger. Yet, there was still a treasure chest inside.</p>
<p>“I’m very certain now that the owner of the maze must be pulling a prank on us. There’s definitely nothing in the final treasure chest.” Zhou Wen felt that he had definitely been fooled.</p>
<p>“At this stage, even if it’s empty, you have to open the last box to take a look,” An Sheng encouraged.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued opening the chest silently. The treasure chest went from the size of a finger to the size of a fingernail.</p>
<p>“F**k, why are there more? I can’t believe it.” Zhou Wen continued opening a few more chests. The treasure chest was already about the size of the jewel on a ring.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to open it, he realized that the square stone treasure chest that resembled a ring’s gem was locked. Although the lock was very small, he could tell that it was a lock.</p>
<p>“Isn’t this a scam? I’ve opened all the way to this point, yet, it’s telling me that it needs a key…” Zhou Wen wished he could smash the treasure chest.</p>
<p>However, it was unknown if the treasure chests were protected by nomological powers. Even Mythical-stage power was unable to damage them.</p>
<p>“Could this small treasure chest be the prize in this treasure chest?” An Sheng said as he looked at the small treasure chest.</p>
<p>“No way?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he reached out to pick up the tiny treasure chest. He had opened so many treasure chests and of them could be moved. Yet, this time, he could pick it up.</p>
<p>“I can actually take it out!” Zhou Wen immediately realized that the fellow who had placed the treasure chest here was definitely doing it on purpose.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a careful look and didn’t find a way to open the treasure chest. He handed it to An Sheng to take a look. After studying it, An Sheng returned it to Zhou Wen. “The structure inside the keyhole is somewhat different from our human locks. It might require a special key to open it. Young Master Wen, put it away now. Think of a way to open it after we are out.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to put away the mini treasure chest. With such a small treasure chest, there was probably nothing inside. Even if there was something, what could be inside?</p>
<p>He had opened two treasure chests which only contained strange items. Zhou Wen was beginning to miss Wang Lu. If he could get her to help him open the treasure chests, he definitely wouldn’t be so unlucky to have such strange items.</p>
<p>The two of them set off again. Due to their previous experience, An Sheng was afraid that this small treasure chest would trigger a change in the maze, so he walked even more carefully.</p>
<p>However, nothing unexpected happened. Just like before, as long as they waited for the hourglass’s safe period, they could successfully pass through the stone rooms.</p>
<p>Finally, Zhou Wen and An Sheng arrived at the location of the third treasure chest. Zhou Wen stood in front of it and pressed his palms together. He prayed in every direction. “Gods from every denomination, please bless me. I don’t wish to become rich overnight. I just want something normal to come out. Mythical Companion Beasts or something, just one will do. I’m really not picky…”</p>
<p>While praying, Zhou Wen summoned the baby tiger, hoping to increase his luck.</p>
<p>An Sheng held back his laughter when he heard Zhou Wen mutter to himself. He said in all seriousness, “Young Master, it’s all determined by fate. Open it quickly.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and opened the lid.</p>
<p>“It’s indeed very normal…” An Sheng looked into the box and immediately laughed. This was because the box was empty. There was nothing inside.</p>
<p>“That’s it?” Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>“Why don’t I take you to find another box? What if you’re born different and can open a fourth box?” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Don’t trouble yourself. Let’s return,” Zhou Wen said with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>He decided that he would never open any cursed chests or other items that depended on luck again unless he could come with Wang Lu.</p>
<p>An Sheng led Zhou Wen out. It was impossible to return the way they came. As the stone room’s location kept changing, he could only find a new path.</p>
<p>Thankfully, nothing happened on the way back. The two of them successfully exited the maze.</p>
<p>An Sheng used the metal plate to seal the well’s entrance again. He covered it with soil as a disguise. Unless it was a coincidence, it would be difficult to discover the entrance to the maze.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that the crystal hourglass in his hand had appeared to freeze. The sand inside which should still be flowing was frozen. It looked like time had stopped. It was extremely magical.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, it’s not as though you didn’t gain anything. Even if the small treasure chest is empty, this crystal hourglass is rather magical. It might really be a treasure,” An Sheng consoled.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to say anything. He put away the crystal hourglass and the mini treasure chest and planned on thinking of a way to open it when he returned.</p>
<p>The two of them returned to Luoyang, but they realized that there were very few people on the city streets. Soon, they realized that most people were watching a livestream.</p>
<p>“Someone actually challenged Primordial Sword Immortal again. It’s no wonder so many people are watching the livestream.” Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to search and discovered the problem.</p>
<p>“That’s not surprising. There aren’t many days left for the three-month deadline. There must be someone who can’t hold back. Let’s see who’s challenging Primordial Sword Immortal,” An Sheng said as he took out his phone and turned on the livestream. He ended up somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>In the arena, Primordial Sword Immortal had already revealed his sword immortal body. He stood in the arena with the stone sword in hand, but there was no sign of a challenger.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sword immortal’s head seemed to suffer a heavy blow as his body flew out horizontally.</p>
<p>“What was that?” Zhou Wen and An Sheng failed to see what had happened.</p>
