<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>After Primordial Sword Immortal was sent flying, he immediately flew into the air and slashed out rows of sword beams in all directions.</p>
<p>However, other than Primordial Sword Immortal and his sword beams, Zhou Wen and An Sheng saw nothing.</p>
<p>“An invisible Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen and An Sheng could see the surprise in each other’s eyes.</p>
<p>Invisibility Companion Beasts were rare. Zhou Wen had an Invisibility Cloak Companion Egg, but it was a problematic Companion Egg. He hadn’t managed to hatch it yet.</p>
<p>Apart from that, he had also heard of some Companion Beasts that could be invisible. However, they weren’t absolutely invisible.</p>
<p>For example, a Companion Beast named Chameleon could fuse with the environment through Chameleon Transformation and reach the goal of invisibility.</p>
<p>However, this kind of invisibility was basically useless against top-notch experts.</p>
<p>Ignoring Mythical creatures, even Epic experts like Zhou Wen’s Hell King Life Soul could sense minute changes in the airflow.</p>
<p>To just be visually invisible wasn’t of much use against top-notch experts.</p>
<p>It was only when dealing with special skills like the Bright Torch Vision World that invisibility had some effect.</p>
<p>What was truly terrifying wasn’t visual invisibility, but complete invisibility. Even one’s body could be concealed. It wouldn’t cause any airflow, emit heat, or produce a lifeforce field. It was as if one had vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Only then could an existence like Primordial Sword Immortal not discover its location.</p>
<p>In the battle arena’s situation, Primordial Sword Immortal clearly hadn’t discovered the enemy’s location. All he could do was continuously slash out large swaths of sword beams, hoping to use the dense sword beams to force the enemy out.</p>
<p>This was clearly useless. Soon, Primordial Sword Immortal suffered another baffling strike and flew out again.</p>
<p>The battle scene in the arena was very strange. It was as though Primordial Sword Immortal was fighting the air, but he was constantly being attacked. The sword immortal’s spirit body was also flickering from time to time. It didn’t look good.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“There are still limitations to a livestream. Let’s go to the cube to take a look,” An Sheng said as he drove towards the cube.</p>
<p>There was almost no one on the other streets. The streets that could see the cube’s screen were packed with people. People couldn’t even squeeze through, never mind cars.</p>
<p>Even the buildings on both sides of the street were filled with people.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and An Sheng had no choice but to find a place to park the car before finding a relatively closer spot to watch the battle.</p>
<p>The cube’s big screen could perfectly enact the real battle. It was the same as a real scene. This was something that even high-speed cameras weren’t capable of.</p>
<p>No matter how powerful the camera’s functions were, there were still limitations. For example, no matter how high the resolution was, it was impossible to reach the standards of the real world.</p>
<p>Just like the scene on the phone, Primordial Sword Immortal was still being thrashed unilaterally.</p>
<p>His opponent seemed to be deliberately humiliating Primordial Sword Immortal. Every strike was like an invisible fist striking Primordial Sword Immortal’s face, sending him flying.</p>
<p>Again and again, it struck. It wasn’t in a rush to finish off Primordial Sword Immortal. It was as though it wanted to appreciate Primordial Sword Immortal’s sorry state.</p>
<p>Ever since Primordial Sword Immortal appeared out of nowhere and suppressed the rankings for a few months, accepting the challenges of many powerful Companion Beasts, he had always appeared invincible. He was practically synonymous with invincibility. When had he ever been in such a sorry state?</p>
<p>Primordial Sword Immortal attempted to force his opponent out by using many methods, but the outcome was not as he wished. He was completely unable to determine his opponent’s location.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the name on the ranking. The Companion Beast that challenged Primordial Sword Immortal was named “Origin Realm King”, but he didn’t see the image of Origin Realm King.</p>
<p>Could it be that Origin Realm King is invisible? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>The battle continued in a one-sided manner. The invincible Primordial Sword Immortal was helpless against an invisible opponent. All he could do was passively take a beating.</p>
<p>“It looks like the number one spot on the rankings will finally be changed.”</p>
<p>“Origin Realm King, why have I never heard of it before?”</p>
<p>“Indeed, invisible opponents are the most terrifying. Origin Realm King is too powerful. To be able to beat Primordial Sword Immortal to such a state, it’s practically invincible.”</p>
<p>“I wonder who the Origin Realm King belongs to?”</p>
<p>“That’s hard to guess. I’ve only heard of legends about the Divine Realm, the Immortal Realm, the Fiend Realm, the Spirit Realm, the Ghost Realm, the Demon Realm, and so on. I’ve never heard of the Origin Realm.”</p>
<p>“Could it be from overseas?”</p>
<p>“Probably not. If the Origin Realm King is from overseas, I’d rather support Primordial Sword Immortal taking first place.”</p>
<p>The entire Federation was abuzz with discussion. Primordial Sword Immortal was clearly at a disadvantage. Although he hadn’t used his Wheel of Destiny and still had the ability to deliver a final blow, his chances of winning were much lower.</p>
<p>This was because most people determined that Primordial Sword Immortal’s Wheel of Destiny was an offensive skill. He didn’t even know where his opponent was, so the effects of the Wheel of Destiny were too limited. Unless Primordial Sword Immortal’s Wheel of Destiny had a huge area of effect, it was difficult to turn defeat into victory.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched the battle the entire time. He had even used the Holy Hell King’s Eye, but he still couldn’t see where Origin Realm King was.</p>
<p>What powerful invisibility. It can even hide the sinflames on its body? Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, we should be able to see Primordial Sword Immortal’s Wheel of Destiny.” An Sheng also believed that Primordial Sword Immortal had been forced into a corner.</p>
<p>It wasn’t only An Sheng. The six families and many experts also believed so. At this stage, Primordial Sword Immortal couldn’t sit idle.</p>
<p>Just as everyone was hoping that Primordial Sword Immortal would release his Wheel of Destiny, something unexpected happened.</p>
<p>Primordial Sword Immortal actually chose to forfeit and gave up the throne of first place. He didn’t use the power of his Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>The entire Federation was in an uproar. After occupying the rankings for months, the invincible Primordial Sword Immortal had been defeated just like that. First place was given to someone else, and Primordial Realm King became the strongest Companion Beast in the world.</p>
<p>Since Primordial Sword Immortal didn’t use his Wheel of Destiny, it meant that he knew that he couldn’t win even if he used it.</p>
<p>There were less than four days left before the three-month deadline Wang Mingyuan mentioned was reached.</p>
<p>All the major media outlets in the Federation were reporting on the matter of Origin Realm King taking first place. They were also guessing who its owner was.</p>
<p>Just like Primordial Sword Immortal, the owner of Origin Realm King had never appeared. All the speculation was nothing but speculation.</p>
<p>However, according to the deductions of the six families, it was very likely that Origin Realm King was an overseas Companion Beast. This was because, in the legends of the Federation’s four districts, there didn’t seem to be a place like the Origin Realm.</p>
<p>While people were guessing the origins and true colors of the Origin Realm King, the cubes around the world underwent a strange change. Each cube displayed a 72-hour countdown.</p>
<p>Anyone with a smidgen of intelligence could roughly guess what it meant. There were less than 72 hours left before the three-month deadline.</p>
<h3 id='chapter701'>Chapter 701: Light Beast’s Challenge</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>All the major factions who wanted to vie for first place mobilized their forces to study what kind of Companion Beast the Origin Realm King was, as well as its various abilities.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the Origin Realm King’s most terrifying ability was invisibility. Even Primordial Sword Immortal couldn’t find it. This was an extremely terrifying ability.</p>
<p>In addition, it was also probably very fast. Otherwise, even if it was invisible, it would be difficult for it to dodge Primordial Sword Immortal’s high-speed sword beams.</p>
<p>Based on these two points, professionals began to study and analyze various possibilities.</p>
<p>Everyone was constantly paying attention to the rankings. As there were less than 72 hours left, there was a chance that someone could challenge the Origin Realm King at any time.</p>
<p>In fact, other than first place, there were already many people with lower rankings challenging those with higher rankings. They hoped to obtain a better spot before the ranking matches ended.</p>
<p>In the final 72 hours, there was only an hour to accept the challenge. If one didn’t accept the challenge within the hour, they would automatically be declared the loser.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also studying Origin Realm King. After watching the battle between Origin Realm King and Primordial Sword Immortal, he had a nagging feeling that something was amiss.</p>
<p>After getting the video to watch carefully, he still failed to see any problems.</p>
<p>Origin Realm King’s invisibility ability could be said to be perfect. He couldn’t find any flaws. No matter how strong Primordial Sword Immortal was, no matter how strong he was, it was useless against an enemy who could casually appear beside him.</p>
<p>All Companion Beasts have their weaknesses. Is the invisibility ability of the Origin Realm King really that perfect? Zhou Wen didn’t believe in absolute perfection.</p>
<p>Just like Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World, such a powerful skill could be nullified with just a mirror.</p>
<p>Origin Realm King’s invisibility was indeed very powerful, but Zhou Wen felt that it definitely had a weakness. It was just that he hadn’t discovered it yet.</p>
<p>Just as the various factions were nervously studying it, a Companion Beast named Light Beast suddenly challenged the first-ranked Origin Realm King.</p>
<p>“Light beast? Isn’t that a Companion Beast of the Family Clan of Gods? I heard that it has the power of light, but its combat strength isn’t strong. At best, it’s about the level of Inferno Dragon? It’s far inferior to Primordial Sword Immortal. How can it challenge Origin Realm King?”</p>
<p>“Could it be that the Family Clan of Gods has found the weakness of the Origin Realm King?”</p>
<p>“Can Light Beast restrain Origin Realm King?”</p>
<p>Everyone was puzzled as they waited for the battle to begin. They wanted to know from this challenge if the Family Clan of Gods had really found the weakness of Origin Realm King or if they had other motives.</p>
<p>Li Xuan organized the members of the Xuanwen Club to watch the battle in front of a cube. Zhou Wen followed them to the cube. He had a nagging feeling that Origin Realm King’s invisibility wasn’t that perfect.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, don’t tell me everyone in Luoyang is here?” Li Xuan said gloomily as he looked at the crowd.</p>
<p>They were still a few streets away from the cube, but they were already unable to proceed forward. They could only see human heads bobbing about. They couldn’t see the cube at all.</p>
<p>“That’s not surprising. The various Companion Beasts that appeared before, including Primordial Sword Immortal, might be very powerful, but they could at least be clearly seen. However, this Origin Realm King is completely different. You can’t even see it. The unknown has a fatal attraction to human curiosity. Everyone wants to know what kind of Companion Beast Origin Realm King is,” Li Weiyang said.</p>
<p>“At this distance, we can’t see a thing. We might as well stay at home and watch from our phones.” It was rare for Huang Ji to join them. He was actually very interested in the abilities of various Companion Beasts, so he participated in the Xuanwen Club’s excursion.</p>
<p>Of course, he mainly wanted to reproduce the data and abilities of these Companion Beasts in-game.</p>
<p>After the ranking battles began, Huang Ji had been analyzing the abilities of the Companion Beasts. He planned on using them as prototypes to create some game bosses.</p>
<p>“If there’s really no other way, let’s find a quiet restaurant and watch the livestream,” Gulli suggested. He felt that watching the livestream was no different from watching from the cube’s screen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also felt that they were too far away. Even Truth Listener couldn’t reach such a distance, but they couldn’t barge through the crowd.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s heart suddenly stirred as he said to the silent Gu Dian who was at the rear, “Old Gu, walk ahead of us.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company’s eyes lit up as they knew what Li Xuan was thinking. They hurriedly made way for Gu Dian to take the lead.</p>
<p>“Stop squeezing! You… Ah…” A fierce-looking man felt that someone was trying to squeeze past him. He opened his mouth and wanted to curse, but just as he did so, he turned his gaze over. When he saw the person, his legs trembled in fear and he nearly fell to the ground. He hurriedly shut his mouth and retreated in fear.</p>
<p>He looked fierce himself, but when he saw the person squeezing through, he was so frightened that his heart pounded and cold sweat broke out on his back.</p>
<p>He had never seen such a ferocious person in his entire life. He was very worried that the other party would directly stab him to death. Therefore, he kept retreating, forcing out some space to make way for the person.</p>
<p>Gu Dian ignored him and continued walking forward.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company lined up and followed closely behind Gu Dian. For some reason, they felt the thrill of cutting through a line that spanned several streets.</p>
<p>The streets were extremely crowded. Everyone wanted to squeeze in, but no one was willing to give in. There were even quite a number of people who had verbal disputes.</p>
<p>However, Gu Dian successfully passed through the crowd. It didn’t look difficult at all.</p>
<p>Before long, Zhou Wen and company arrived at a suitable distance. It was equivalent to the best seats in a theater—around the sixth or seventh row. They waited for Origin Realm King to accept the challenge.</p>
<p>As it only had an hour to accept the challenge, and it took Zhou Wen and company quite a bit of time to rush over, there were less than ten minutes left. Yet, Origin Realm King still hadn’t accepted the challenge.</p>
<p>“It can’t be. Origin Realm King hasn’t accepted the challenge? Could it be that Light Beast is really its nemesis?”</p>
<p>“It’s really possible. Under the light, darkness has nowhere to hide. Perhaps it’s really the nemesis of invisibility?”</p>
<p>“No matter how great a nemesis it is, Origin Realm King is an existence that can fight Primordial Sword Immortal. It would be odd if Light Beast could have an effect on it.”</p>
<p>As people were arguing, they saw the name on the arena flash. Origin Realm King had accepted the challenge, but they didn’t see its figure.</p>
<p>Everyone knew that Origin Realm King had already appeared in the arena, but they just couldn’t see it.</p>
<p>Light Beast clearly knew this, so it didn’t hesitate to launch an attack. Light emitted from its body like a sun, illuminating the entire arena. This was its Wheel of Destiny’s power, Light Ray.</p>
<h3 id='chapter702'>Chapter 702: Perfect Companion Beast</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“I see. This Light Beast is using attacks indiscriminately to force out Origin Realm King. No matter how invisible Origin Realm King is, it can’t really disappear. Such an attack is very likely to find its traces,” Gulli said.</p>
<p>Sadie nodded and said, “Light Beast is a Mythical Companion Beast of the Family Clan of Gods. Its Wheel of Destiny is called Light Ray. Although its offensive power isn’t strong, its range is very large. Furthermore, it can last for a long time. It’s suitable for restraining invisibility. From the looks of it, the Family Clan of Gods didn’t find a way to restrain Origin Realm King. They just want to use this method to figure out what kind of Companion Beast Origin Realm King is.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company stared at the cube’s huge screen. The light illuminated the entire arena. If anything was in the arena, even if it couldn’t be seen, it would be injured by the light rays.</p>
<p>Even if it couldn’t be injured, it would have some reaction.</p>
<p>Strangely, nothing happened across the entire arena. The light rays didn’t meet any obstacles, nor did they collide with any forces. Neither did the light refract.</p>
<p>“That’s strange. Could it be that Origin Realm King is really an invisible and intangible spirit body?”</p>
<p>“Impossible. If it’s really an invisible and incorporeal spirit body, how could Origin Realm King directly attack Primordial Sword Immortal during the battle? It definitely has a form.”</p>
<p>“As you can see, Light Ray has already enveloped the entire arena. If it really has a body, it’s impossible for it to not react to the Light Ray.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps it’s some temporarily incorporeal skill. It shouldn’t last long.”</p>
<p>The various families were discussing how Origin Realm King had dodged Light Ray, but they couldn’t make an accurate guess.</p>
<p>Light Beast continued shooting out Light Ray. It could do so for several hours, so there was no need to worry about it being ambushed by Origin Realm King.</p>
<p>Just as everyone was discussing, they suddenly saw the nose and face of the Light Beast crater as though it had been smashed by an invisible fist.</p>
<p>Then, Light Beast flew out, bleeding from its seven orifices. It died immediately without even having the chance to surrender.</p>
<p>Instantly, everyone broke out into a cold sweat. Many people had guessed that Light Beast was no match for Origin Realm King.</p>
<p>However, no one expected Light Beast to lose so tragically. Not only did it fail to force out Origin Realm King, but it was even killed in one strike.</p>
<p>Clearly, the difference between the two was too great. Light Beast couldn’t even withstand one strike. The Family Clan of Gods’ plan had failed and they had even lost Light Beast.</p>
<p>“It’s really too powerful. It has invincible invisibility and invincible strength. It’s practically a perfect Companion Beast.”</p>
<p>“If Origin Realm King wants to assassinate someone, I’m afraid no one in this world can escape its assassination, right? Just the thought of it is terrifying.”</p>
<p>“What Primordial Sword Immortal? What Death of the Underworld? Compared to Origin Realm King, they are so weak.”</p>
<p>“I wonder who was so lucky to obtain a Companion Beast like Origin Realm King.”</p>
<p>The ordinary citizens of the Federation were discussing the topic of Origin Realm King. In the battle against Primordial Sword Immortal, people were still doubtful of Origin Realm King’s strength. However, killing Light Beast in one strike had allowed Origin Realm King to truly ascend to the throne. It left a deep mark in the history of human Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>The various families began their intense research and analysis work. They had used all sorts of high-tech equipment to record videos, so they repeatedly studied and analyzed them.</p>
<p>However, no matter how they analyzed and studied it, Origin Realm King’s invisibility was perfect.</p>
<p>Light Beast’s indiscriminate Light Ray couldn’t touch its body at all. It was even killed in a frontal attack. This capability was terrifying and made one feel uneasy.</p>
<p>Just as the man on the street said, having Origin Realm King was equivalent to having the most terrifying assassin in the world. Even the members of the six families were worried that they would be assassinated by Origin Realm King.</p>
<p>If Origin Realm King was from overseas, the Federation would be in even more danger.</p>
<p>Even if it was a Companion Beast of the Federation, it would be equally intolerable. It was like a sharp blade hanging over one’s neck. It was unknown when it would land; furthermore, the person holding the blade wasn’t them.</p>
<p>Repeated studies and analysis ensued as everyone in the world wanted to find out the weakness of Origin Realm King.</p>
<p>“I wonder if the power of Origin Realm King can augment its master,” Feng Qiuyan said in thought.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. It’s already invincible in this state. If it can augment its owner, wouldn’t it be like a bug in games?” Li Xuan curled his lips.</p>
<p>“It’s not impossible. Just like the Invisibility Cloak that once caused a stir, it can make people perfectly invisible. No reconnaissance method can see its existence,” said Huang Ji.</p>
<p>Sadie seemed to know something about the Invisibility Cloak as she continued, “Although the Invisibility Cloak can result in complete invisibility that can’t be detected, there’s a time limit. It can only maintain an invisible and formless state for a period of time. Usually, it’s just invisibility, but it can still be detected by special means. Just like the Light Ray from Light Beast just now, it can expose the Invisibility Cloak under normal conditions. If not for that, the Zhang family wouldn’t have been able to successfully return the Invisibility Cloak to its Companion Egg form back then.”</p>
<p>The few of them discussed as they walked. Zhou Wen didn’t say a word. He had a nagging feeling that something was amiss, but he couldn’t tell what was wrong.</p>
<p>After this battle, no Companion Beasts challenged Origin Realm King again. This was because no one wanted to risk having their Companion Beasts killed.</p>
<p>No Mythical Companion Beast was easy to come by. Knowing that it was suicide, no one was willing to do it.</p>
<p>The various factions could only keep researching and analyzing, hoping to find the weakness of Origin Realm King. However, in the blink of an eye, there were only 48 hours left. No one could figure out the weakness of Origin Realm King.</p>
<p>They watched the video so many times, but they couldn’t even tell where Origin Realm King was, much less figure out what it looked like and what weaknesses it had.</p>
<p>Now, many people believed that Origin Realm King was probably going to take first place in the ranking battle. Up to now, no Companion Beast could restrain it and there wasn’t much time left.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been studying the video the entire time as well. After repeatedly watching it, he failed to find the location of Origin Realm King.</p>
<p>Could it be that the Invisibility ability of Origin Realm King is really that perfect? How many modes of invisibility are there? Spirit Bodies are considered one of them. Origin Realm King is most likely a Spirit Body. However, from its attack patterns, it seems to have a corporeal body. Also, total invisibility is impossible. If it’s just total invisibility, it will definitely be detected by Light Ray. Then, there’s the type akin to Invisibility Cloak that can temporarily turn into nothingness. From the looks of it, this possibility is the highest. Also, it could be as small as Primordial Spore, so it can’t be seen. However, no matter how small it is, it should react when it’s shot by the omnipresent Light Ray… Wait… That’s not right… Zhou Wen seemed to think of something.</p>
<h3 id='chapter703'>Chapter 703: Zhou Wen’s Speculation</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully recalled Origin Realm King’s two battles and specially watched a few important parts of the recording. The things that he originally felt were amiss gradually became clearer.</p>
<p>If I view Origin Realm King as a Companion Beast similar to Primordial Spore, or something even smaller than Primordial Spore, so small that even the Holy Hell King’s eyes can’t see the sinflames on its body, wouldn’t that explain why Primordial Sword Immortal’s sword beam can’t hit it? It’s not because its speed is so fast that Primordial Sword Immortal can’t hit it, but because it’s too small. In that case, its strength definitely can’t be too strong. Therefore, although it looked like it was thrashing Primordial Sword Immortal in all sorts of ways, it was actually unable to kill Primordial Sword Immortal due to its insufficient strength.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued surmising. The battle with Light Beast proved this point even more. Light Ray was everywhere. If Origin Realm King was really in the arena, it would probably trigger a reaction to Light Ray. Even if it can turn into nothingness, at the instant it attacked Light Beast, it should have collided with Light Ray. However, despite repeatedly watching the recordings, nothing whatsoever happened. Light Ray didn’t collide with anything from the beginning to the end. Then, there’s only one explanation. Ever since Origin Realm King entered the arena, it had already drilled into the body of Light Beast. Therefore, Light Ray couldn’t illuminate it no matter how vast the rays were. It wasn’t in the arena at all.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Origin Realm King used this ability to destroy Light Beast’s body or brain. Then, it used an ingenious opportunity to come out of its nostrils and strike Light Beast. It looked like it was extremely powerful and instantly killed Light Beast. In fact, it had already wreaked havoc in Light Beast’s body. The Light Beast was almost dead.</p>
<p>Not only did it kill Light Beast, but it also made everyone believe that Origin Realm King’s destructive power was extremely powerful. It concealed its greatest weakness, preventing others from easily challenging it. What a good plan. The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that it was right. He brightened up.</p>
<p>Although he had guessed the various possibilities of Origin Realm King, defeating it wasn’t an easy task.</p>
<p>Even Truth Listener’s ability and the Holy Hell King’s Eye couldn’t discover its existence. Its body was definitely much smaller than Primordial Spore. It had probably reached the level of an atom.</p>
<p>Primordial Spore can parasitize large creatures, but it’s not that effective against those that are smaller than it. Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World should be able to kill it, but if it enters Torch Dragon’s body before Torch Dragon activates Bright Torch Vision World, then Bright Torch Vision World will be useless… After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that the Origin Realm King wasn’t easy to deal with.</p>
<p>It was very easy to fight Origin Realm King to a draw. With the strength it displayed during its battle with Primordial Sword Immortal, Zhou Wen only needed to use Tyrant Behemoth to challenge it. No matter how it attempted to drill into Tyrant Behemoth, it couldn’t cause any injuries.</p>
<p>However, it wouldn’t be easy for Tyrant Behemoth to find and kill it.</p>
<p>I wonder what kind of Companion Beast Origin Realm King is. If it’s a fungal or bacterial type, perhaps I can send Tai Sui to deal with it, Zhou Wen thought to himself, but he didn’t immediately attempt it.</p>
<p>After all, everything was just Zhou Wen’s speculation. Tai Sui was only at the Epic stage. If his speculation was wrong, or if the Origin Realm King was just small in size and wasn’t a Companion Beast like a fungus, Tai Sui wouldn’t be able to restrain it. Wouldn’t that lead to a tragic death?</p>
<p>There were still more than two days left. There would definitely be Companion Beasts challenging Origin Realm King, so Zhou Wen planned on taking a wait-and-see approach before deciding if he should send Tai Sui.</p>
<p>Even if he were to send Tai Sui, he would have to wait until the time was almost up. Otherwise, with Tai Sui being so weak, it would be easily defeated by other Mythical Companion Beasts even after he defeated Origin Realm King.</p>
<p>While waiting for Origin Realm King to be challenged, Zhou Wen didn’t idle. He continued grinding in-game.</p>
<p>Ever since he knew that killing Guardians could advance Slaughterer, Zhou Wen had been targeting them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the one in Ant City was just too powerful. After some thought, Zhou Wen decided to target the nine black dragons in the underground sea.</p>
<p>I have quite a number of Mythical Companion Beasts now. I have the ferocious pair, Behemoth and Truth Listener, and Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World. Together with the Great Might Vajra Bull, Golden Overlord Sword, and Demonic Neonate, who specializes in sneaking attacks on others, I can try to see if I can deal with the nine black dragons, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>After arriving at the underground sea, Zhou Wen first summoned his Mythical Companion Beasts. Together with Demonic Neonate, the lineup was rather powerful.</p>
<p>Six-Winged Guardian Dragon was still the same as before. It appeared behind the blood-colored avatar in its six-winged form to prevent it from being instantly killed.</p>
<p>I still have to find time to draw more Substitute Talismans in the future, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s order, Truth Listener and Behemoth charged into the underground sea.</p>
<p>The Great Might Vajra Bull was actually afraid of water. It could only provide support on land and didn’t enter the sea.</p>
<p>However, this wasn’t a big deal. All he needed to do was lure the nine black dragons to a spot near the coast and let the Great Might Vajra Bull’s Soul Suppression Bell work.</p>
<p>Before long, the nine black dragons appeared with the war wagon. After they saw Behemoth and Truth Listener, the chains on their bodies automatically released.</p>
<p>The nine black dragons immediately perked up as they transformed into ferocious dragons that charged at Behemoth and Truth Listener with a roar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen made the two of them fly back and return to the shore. The two giant beasts stood in the shallow water, where the seawater only reached their calves.</p>
<p>When the nine black dragons charged over, Zhou Wen immediately realized that something was amiss. The strength and speed of the black dragons were even stronger than Truth Listener when it had shattered an earring.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that Truth Listener and Behemoth could each fight three or four black dragons alone, but now, he realized that without using Absolute Strength and shattering the other earrings, fighting two alone was somewhat difficult.</p>
<p>Roar!</p>
<p>Behemoth roared and used Absolute Strength to suppress the nine black dragons.</p>
<p>The nine black dragons were beginning to be affected by the suction of Absolute Strength, but soon, they forcefully escaped its restraints.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Behemoth, who had used Absolute Strength, threw a punch and collided with a black dragon horn.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s surprise, Behemoth, who had Absolute Strength, was forced to take a few steps back by the collision with the black dragon. It plopped into the seawater, stirring up huge waves.</p>
<p>Truth Listener was in a worse state. It clashed with a black dragon and was sent flying into the sea.</p>
<p>Something’s amiss… How can the nine black dragons be so powerful… Zhou Wen was alarmed as he carefully looked at the nine black dragons, but he didn’t see anything.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he switched to the Holy Hell King Life Soul. With the Holy Hell’s Eyes, he was immediately alarmed. There were chains that couldn’t be seen with the naked eye connecting the nine black dragons to the war wagon.</p>
<h3 id='chapter704'>Chapter 704: Battling the Nine Dragons</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The chains weren’t corporeal, but they were like soul chains. The nine black dragons were connected by them, and at the same time, the chains combined their powers.</p>
<p>The power unleashed by a black dragon was equivalent to the power of nine black dragons unleashing their might at the same time.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder Tyrant Behemoth, who has used Absolute Strength, can’t suppress the black dragon. This is fighting nine alone… Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth stood up again and roared as it charged at the nine black dragons.</p>
<p>Its strength was unparalleled, but it was still difficult to deal with them when it was actually equivalent to single-handedly fighting nine. The black dragon was a Mythical creature with immense strength, and with the nine of them combined as one, the explosive power they released suppressed Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Every clash of strength forced Tyrant Behemoth to retreat.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Tyrant Behemoth was indeed extremely powerful when using Absolute Strength. It wasn’t severely injured even under the combined forces of the nine black dragons.</p>
<p>Truth Listener rushed out and attacked the black dragon from another direction.</p>
<p>The nine black dragons’ movements were not affected at all despite being connected by invisible chains. Furthermore, the powers circulated among them extremely quickly.</p>
<p>As one side sent Tyrant Behemoth retreating, the other side fought Truth Listener, who had gathered its strength, again. The terrifying dragon claws broke through normal speed limits and blasted Truth Listener away.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already controlled the blood-colored avatar to slash at the black dragon. The Great Might Vajra Bull also released the Soul Suppression Bell at the same time. When the bell rang, the invisible chain trembled. The Soul Suppression Bell didn’t work, nor did it make the black dragons faint.</p>
<p>Truth Listener looked like it was about to go berserk and shatter another earring. Zhou Wen hurriedly summoned it and Behemoth back before turning around to escape to the Bat Cave.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate hadn’t attacked all this time, so it looked like she hadn’t found a chance.</p>
<p>The nine black dragons didn’t dare come ashore. They roared in the water, causing huge waves to surge into the sky. The commotion was extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>The nine black dragons are so terrifying. I wonder how powerful the Guardian in the war wagon is? I’m afraid it’s another Buddha Annihilation… Zhou Wen looked at the nine black dragons that surged with ferocious flames as he secretly calculated his chances of killing the Guardian in the war wagon.</p>
<p>I finally understand why the Lost Immortal Sutra can imitate so many Essence Energy Arts and obtain many benefits so easily. Even with such an abnormal ability, killing a Guardian is still as difficult as ascending to the heavens. Zhou Wen had already realized that the Lost Immortal Sutra was indeed an unparalleled Essence Energy Art.</p>
<p>Ignoring the question of whether the Lost Immortal Sutra could advance to the Mythical stage, just killing the Guardian to advance to the Life Soul realm was probably unprecedented.</p>
<p>Unless I think of a way to sever the connection between the nine black dragons, preventing them from gathering the power of nine dragons to attack together, killing them is just a pipe dream. Zhou Wen began to miss the six-winged seraphim.</p>
<p>Among the Guardians that Zhou Wen had seen, he was the easiest to kill.</p>
<p>Unable to kill the nine black dragons, Zhou Wen had no choice but to vent his frustration on the other dimensional creatures. He killed all the rare dimensional creatures in the dungeons and also killed some Musical Note Sprites.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen’s Musical Note Sprites numbered nearly ten thousand. Under the control of the Golden Harp, they could be of some use. However, they were still a distance away from the million-strong army that Zhou Wen had expected.</p>
<p>I heard that there’s an Undead Scourge in the West District which sent millions of Undead rampaging across the land. In the future, I’ll control the million-strong Musical Note Army and create a Musical Scourge. It will be much cooler than the Undead Scourge. At the very least, they look better than them, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Despite leaving a wake of destruction, his luck today seemed to be especially bad. He didn’t have any rare Companion Beasts drop.</p>
<p>It was time for Medusa to respawn. Zhou Wen planned on farming Medusa once. When he arrived at the Curse Demon Palace, he suddenly thought of something.</p>
<p>Every time he came to the Curse Demon Palace, the beautiful girl would become the demoness, Medusa. Therefore, Zhou Wen killed Medusa in her demoness form every time.</p>
<p>What will happen if I kill the beautiful girl before she becomes Medusa? Zhou Wen couldn’t hold back his emotions when he had this thought.</p>
<p>How can I kill her before she transforms? Zhou Wen didn’t open the door to Medusa’s palace.</p>
<p>In the past, Zhou Wen had attacked her when she was a beautiful girl, but once he attacked her, she would immediately become Medusa. Killing her before she became Medusa was clearly not an easy task.</p>
<p>In terms of speed, my Transcendent Flying Immortal is fast enough, but I can’t kill the beautiful girl before she becomes Medusa. In that case, I can only rely on her. Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he looked at Demonic Neonate, who was standing there with a cold expression like a doll.</p>
<p>As long as Zhou Wen didn’t take the initiative to attack, the beautiful girl wouldn’t become Medusa even if he entered the palace.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen finished his plans, he carried Demonic Neonate into the palace. Indeed, he saw Medusa sitting there quietly. The current Medusa was still a beautiful and pure girl. Just one look at her made him pity her.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t in-game but in the real world, Zhou Wen really couldn’t bear to attack her.</p>
<p>However, this was the game world. No matter how beautiful she was, she was still an NPC. He didn’t have any qualms.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked towards the beautiful girl step by step without gathering any Essence Energy or using his Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>However, Demonic Neonate was slumped on his back. Her black eyes were secretly looking at the beautiful Medusa.</p>
<p>When he arrived in front of the beautiful girl, Zhou Wen didn’t continue walking forward. If he continued walking forward, even if Zhou Wen didn’t attack her, the beautiful girl would become Medusa.</p>
<p>At that moment, Demonic Neonate, who was on Zhou Wen’s back, suddenly moved. A black-purple sword beam drilled out from beneath the blood-colored avatar’s crotch.</p>
<p>Without giving the beautiful girl a chance to react, the demonic sword had already stabbed her in the chest, causing her blood to splatter everywhere. Demonic aura invaded her body, causing her to fall to the ground.</p>
<p>It’s done! Zhou Wen was delighted as he looked at the beautiful girl’s corpse, only to see it disintegrating and disappearing.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>Soon, something dropped.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a closer look and was immediately overjoyed. The thing the beautiful girl dropped was a Companion Egg that was crystalline like a sapphire.</p>
<p>A Companion Beast dropped! Zhou Wen found it unbelievable. It hadn’t been a day or two since he started farming Medusa. Dimensional crystals had dropped, but there had never been a Companion Egg drop.</p>
<p>Could it be that only Medusa in her beautiful form can drop a Companion Egg? Zhou Wen guessed as he picked it up.</p>
<h3 id='chapter705'>Chapter 705: Medusa Companion Beast</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Medusa: Mythical</p>
<p>Life Providence: Tragic Beauty</p>
<p>Life Soul: Eyes of Enticement</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Demon God Transformation</p>
<p>Strength: 41</p>
<p>Speed: 41</p>
<p>Constitution: 41</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 41</p>
<p>Talent Skill: None</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately alarmed when he saw Medusa’s stats. The weakest Mythical that Zhou Wen had seen was Primordial Spore.</p>
<p>However, Primordial Spore still had the Eternal Immortality Life Providence that made it invincible. It also had a parasitic skill that was very useful.</p>
<p>Medusa was ridiculously weak in contrast. She didn’t have any skills. Her Life Providence was Tragic Beauty—a negative skill that actually reduced her stats.</p>
<p>The only useful ones were probably the Eyes of Enticement and the Demon God Transformation.</p>
<p>The Eyes of Enticement were very similar to the Eyes of Petrification. They could petrify people, but the limitations of the Eyes of Enticement were much greater than the Eyes of Petrification.</p>
<p>The Demon God Transformation was even more ridiculous. It was actually a single-time use Wheel of Destiny. The annotation was very clear. Once used, it would forever transform into a Demon God, making it impossible for her to be restored to her human body.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, after using the Demon God Transformation, Medusa should become a snake-haired demoness. Although becoming a snake-haired demoness will definitely be much stronger than she is now, she’s just too ugly in that form. She still looks good now… However, good looks can’t be eaten or used to block bullets. What’s the point?</p>
<p>Although he had such thoughts, Zhou Wen still couldn’t bring himself to do it when he thought about how such a beautiful Medusa would become an ugly snake-haired demoness.</p>
<p>Forget it. I’ll keep her for now. Who knows what special effects she might have? Zhou Wen planned on farming Medusa tomorrow to see if Medusa in her girl form would continue dropping Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>If a Companion Egg dropped, he would try to see what would happen after the Demon God Transformation.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Before Medusa respawned again, a Companion Beast challenged Origin Realm King on the rankings. This time, it was none other than Death of the Underworld.</p>
<p>Li Xuan invited Zhou Wen to watch the duel at the cube. When they arrived, the Origin Realm King still hadn’t accepted the challenge.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, who do you think will win this battle?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to tell,” Zhou Wen said with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>The battle between Origin Realm King and Death of the Underworld was worth watching. Zhou Wen couldn’t predict the final outcome.</p>
<p>Death of the Underworld had a Spirit Body, rendering physical damage virtually ineffective. It was useless even if Origin Realm King entered its body.</p>
<p>However, it was also unknown if Death of the Underworld’s attacks were effective against Origin Realm King. Therefore, Zhou Wen was very curious about the outcome of the battle.</p>
<p>Soon, only ten minutes were left for the countdown. Just like the last time, the name on the ranking flashed at the end. Origin Realm King had accepted the challenge.</p>
<p>Everyone, including Zhou Wen, widened their eyes. They wanted to know how Death of the Underworld would deal with Origin Realm King. With the experience gleaned from Light Beast’s lesson, Death of the Underworld would definitely do something. It might even use its Wheel of Destiny to transport the Origin Realm King into the Underworld for the final battle, just like with Primordial Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>However, to everyone’s surprise, after Origin Realm King accepted the challenge, Death of the Underworld did nothing but float in the air.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? Why isn’t Death of the Underworld moving? Does he want to be passive and end up getting beaten?”</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t he strike first to force out the invisible Origin Realm King?”</p>
<p>“What is he trying to do?”</p>
<p>People discussed as they guessed what Death of the Underworld was planning.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat when he saw the motionless Death of the Underworld. It was as though it had fallen asleep while floating there. It was not good.</p>
<p>That’s bad. Someone has guessed that Origin Realm King is a microscopic Companion Beast just like me. They know that its strength is insufficient to kill a top Mythical Companion Beast, so they want to use the characteristics of Origin Realm King to stall for time. They want to wait until the countdown ends before defeating Origin Realm King… Zhou Wen already understood Death of the Underworld’s strategy.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen had thought of a similar method. For example, if Tyrant Behemoth challenged Origin Realm King, Origin Realm King wouldn’t be able to kill Tyrant Behemoth, so he could continue delaying until the time was up.</p>
<p>However, as Tyrant Behemoth might not be able to kill Origin Realm King, Zhou Wen gave up on this plan. Now that Death of the Underworld had used this plan, it meant that its master was confident that he could defeat Origin Realm King at the final moment.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that Origin Realm King would definitely take this opportunity to kill Death of the Underworld. However, to his surprise, Origin Realm King didn’t take any action.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and immediately understood that Origin Realm King’s master was indeed smart.</p>
<p>It was the best choice for him not to let Origin Realm King move.</p>
<p>If Origin Realm King was really as Zhou Wen and company had guessed—a microscopic Companion Beast that wasn’t very strong—then if it were to attack now, not only would it fail to kill Death of the Underworld, but it would also expose its true strength, allowing the master of Death of the Underworld to understand its weakness.</p>
<p>However, Origin Realm King remained motionless, giving Death of the Underworld immense pressure.</p>
<p>If it didn’t move, Death of the Underworld’s master wouldn’t be able to confirm if his judgment was correct. This would raise doubts.</p>
<p>Could it be that Origin Realm King also wants to stall for time? Could it be that it’s different from my conclusion? Could it be confident that it can defeat Death of the Underworld at the end of the countdown?</p>
<p>All sorts of guesses appeared in people’s minds. It was originally Death of the Underworld who was stalling for time, but it devolved into both sides stalling for time. No one could be sure whether Origin Realm King had the ability to defeat Death of the Underworld.</p>
<p>If this continued, there would be no time or chance in the event Death of the Underworld was defeated.</p>
<p>If Death of the Underworld were to attack now, the previous plan would fail. It would also expose Death of the Underworld’s strength. It was equivalent to shooting oneself in the foot.</p>
<p>Although the two Companion Beasts in the arena didn’t move, the battle had already begun. Such a battle was no longer limited to the confines of the arena. Instead, the owners of the two Companion Beasts were having a psychological game.</p>
<p>Ordinary people couldn’t figure out the mystery behind it. After waiting all day, people who were originally looking forward to a huge battle ended up surprised to watch a battle in which one of the Companion Beasts couldn’t be seen while the other Companion Beast remained motionless. It left them depressed.</p>
<p>“What the hell? Wasn’t this supposed to be a challenge? Why aren’t they fighting?”</p>
<p>“Hurry up and fight. Let us see which is the best—Origin Realm King or Death of the Underworld.”</p>
<p>“Can’t you tell? Death of the Underworld doesn’t even dare to move. It must be afraid of Origin Realm King. When Origin Realm King makes a move, Death of the Underworld will die like Light Beast.”</p>
<p>“Bullsh*t. It’s obvious that Origin Realm King is afraid of Death of the Underworld. Don’t you see that it doesn’t dare to attack? Death of the Underworld is almost falling asleep waiting for it to attack.”</p>
<p>The arena remained still. The fans of the two Companion Beasts and the streamers who supported them were the first to engage in a war of words.</p>
<h3 id='chapter706'>Chapter 706: Quick Battle</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The silent battle continued, greatly displeasing many onlookers.</p>
<p>By standing there for a few hours without moving, how was this a duel? It was a punishment.</p>
<p>Questions that this was a rigged match began to spread. Some people were already suspecting that Origin Realm King and Death of the Underworld came from the same faction. They were stalling for time to directly obtain first place.</p>
<p>In fact, even many of the six families had such doubts.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also felt that something was amiss. Although Death of the Underworld might not be from the same faction as Origin Realm King, if they were to continue wasting time like this, either one of them would definitely end up coming first.</p>
<p>All the factions that still had hope for coming in first were paying attention to the battle situation. At the same time, they were secretly gathering information.</p>
<p>Although they didn’t know who Origin Realm King belonged to, Death of the Underworld was undoubtedly from the Family Clan of Gods. Therefore, all sorts of probing and pressure targeted towards the Family Clan of Gods continued.</p>
<p>“Old Boll, if you can’t beat it, hurry up and admit defeat. Don’t end up letting that Origin Realm King reap all the benefits later,” Rhaego Cape said with a smile while on a video call with the Family Clan of Gods.</p>
<p>Boll said indifferently, “There’s no need for you to worry.”</p>
<p>Rhaego continued, “Old Boll, if you have a hundred percent chance of defeating Origin Realm King, it doesn’t matter if you wait until the end. But if you don’t have a hundred percent chance, why don’t you leave a chance?”</p>
<p>Boll naturally understood what Rhaego was getting at. He was also very conflicted.</p>
<p>He had originally planned on dragging it out to the end before letting Death of the Underworld defeat Origin Realm King. Just as Zhou Wen had guessed, he believed that Origin Realm King was a microscopic Companion Beast.</p>
<p>As long as Death of the Underworld opened the path to the Underworld and pulled the microscopic Companion Beast in, it would no longer be able to hide. When that happened, killing it wouldn’t be difficult.</p>
<p>But now, Origin Realm King was also stalling for time. This worried Boll a little.</p>
<p>Many people already knew about the abilities of Death of the Underworld. The owner of Origin Realm King definitely knew some, but he still chose to remain still. This made Boll suspect that the Origin Realm King might have the ability to defeat Death of the Underworld, but it could also be a psychological battle.</p>
<p>After hanging up the call, Boll was thinking about what to do next. However, Feia said, “Father, if we don’t have full confidence in winning, why don’t we do as Rhaego said and leave a way out? We can still grasp the opportunity in our hands.”</p>
<p>“Tell me about it,” Boll said to Feia.</p>
<p>Feia said, “Since we can’t be sure if Death of the Underworld can defeat Origin Realm King, why don’t we complete the battle before the final time limit? It’s naturally best if we can win. If we can’t, we’ll find a chance to forfeit. When the time comes, our Companion Beasts has the initiative to pose the challenge. It’s equivalent to having another chance.”</p>
<p>“I’m just afraid that this opportunity will be snatched away by others,” Boll muttered.</p>
<p>“There can only be one challenger. It depends on who poses the challenge first. We are the ones deciding when Death of the Underworld admits defeat, so we can also apply for the challenge at the same time. How can others be faster than us?” said Feia.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Then let’s do it this way. Prepare your Companion Beast. If Death of the Underworld fails, you will be the one to complete the final battle,” said Boll after some thought.</p>
<p>As there was no battle in the arena, many spectators lost their patience after waiting for several hours. Many people chose to return to work or to do other things. They planned on watching the results nearer to the end of the countdown.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched as time ticked by. Neither side had any intention of taking action. It was apparent that both sides wanted to drag it out until the countdown ended. They knew that there was no hope of vying for first place.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen still held onto a sliver of hope as he rushed to the town in Funiu Mountain. He wanted to wait there for the countdown to end. If there was a chance, he could try again.</p>
<p>In fact, there were many people with the same thoughts as Zhou Wen. Many people from large families were standing guard in front of the cube. Once the battle ended or one side gave up, they would immediately initiate a challenge. Regardless of whether they could win, it was better to try than have no chance at all.</p>
<p>Time slowly passed. When there were only two hours left before the countdown, more and more people returned to the cube. Most of them returned just to see the results.</p>
<p>However, Death of the Underworld and Origin Realm King remained still. One couldn’t be seen, while the other was motionless.</p>
<p>An hour and a half… an hour and fifteen minutes… an hour and ten minutes…</p>
<p>Suddenly, Death of the Underworld, who had been silent all this while, finally moved. Its cloak spread out, and the strange Underworld domain was about to devour the entire arena.</p>
<p>This was identical to when it fought Primordial Sword Immortal. However, Origin Realm King wasn’t Primordial Sword Immortal. If it were to be trapped, there would be a question if it could storm its way out.</p>
<p>Everyone’s spirits were lifted. Death of the Underworld’s sudden attack meant that the two Companion Beasts weren’t from the same faction. They still needed to determine a victor.</p>
<p>Although there was less than an hour and ten minutes left, having some time left meant that there was a chance.</p>
<p>The only thing they were afraid of was that there was too little time left. If one side lost and there was less than an hour left, then even if they chose to challenge the victor, the other side would still have an hour to prepare for battle. Before the challenge was accepted, the countdown would be over.</p>
<p>Please decide the victor before the hour mark! Many people were praying.</p>
<p>However, no one expected the outcome to be far faster than they had imagined.</p>
<p>At the instant Death of the Underworld activated its Underworld domain, a strange scene suddenly happened.</p>
<p>Inside the Death of the Underworld’s grayish smoke-like spirit body, a flower suddenly grew out of its head. The flower was beautiful like snow, and there was lightning circulating over it. It was like an electric flower.</p>
<p>The flower rapidly grew. In an instant, the flower bud bloomed. As the flower bloomed, Death of the Underworld’s Spirit Body seemed to be pulled by some force as it rapidly flowed into the flower, as though it had been devoured by the flower.</p>
<p>Before the Underworld domain could fully activate, half of Death of the Underworld’s body had been sucked into the flower.</p>
<p>Not good! Boll was shocked. He quickly wanted to give up and admit defeat, but it was too late.</p>
<p>The remaining half of Death of the Underworld’s body was completely absorbed by the flower in the blink of an eye. As for the flower, it bloomed and shimmered with a strange electric light. Then, it quickly withered and vanished as though nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned. No one dared to believe that the nearly invincible Death of the Underworld had died just like that. Old Boll’s face was ashen, and even Feia, who was about to issue the challenge, was stunned.</p>
<p>It was just too shocking that Death of the Underworld was instantly killed. It made him hesitate, afraid that his Companion Beast would suffer the same outcome if he entered.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Feia. Everyone who was prepared to issue the challenge hesitated. Death of the Underworld’s death shocked them greatly.</p>
<p>Origin Realm King… is too powerful… The spectators also had such thoughts.</p>
<h3 id='chapter707'>Chapter 707: The Dust Settles</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Just as everyone was in a daze, a Companion Beast almost immediately issued a challenge. The cube’s screen lit up again as a name and a Companion Beast appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>“Tai Sui…” Everyone was slightly taken aback when they saw the Companion Beast and name.</p>
<p>The people from the East District knew what Tai Sui was, but the people from the other districts weren’t aware. However, when they saw a white and tender ball appear on-screen, it didn’t look like a particularly powerful Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“No way? Is that thing a slime? Can such a Companion Beast challenge an invincible Companion Beast like Origin Realm King?” someone from the West District commented.</p>
<p>“Is that a legendary blob monster?” The people from the North District were puzzled.</p>
<p>“How can such a Companion Beast challenge Origin Realm King? Isn’t that guaranteeing Origin Realm King’s first place? Don’t tell me they are in cahoots?” Many people guessed.</p>
<p>Although the people of the East District knew about Tai Sui, they didn’t know much about its abilities. They only knew that Tai Sui brought bad luck. As the saying went, “Messing with Tai Sui incurs disaster.” It was a very popular saying in the East District.</p>
<p>Even if it could bring bad luck, it was impossible for it to defeat a powerful existence like Origin Realm King with bad luck in a duel, right? That was a terrifying existence that could kill Death of the Underworld!</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t think so. Origin Realm King killed Death of the Underworld, Zhou Wen didn’t dare release Tai Sui to challenge him.</p>
<p>However, after seeing how the Origin Realm King killed Death of the Underworld, Zhou Wen was finally certain that Tai Sui would be able to restrain it. In essence, Origin Realm King was still a type of microorganism, not some special physical entity.</p>
<p>As for Tai Sui, it was extremely effective against all kinds of microbes. It could devour the Mythical Primordial Spore back at the Mortal stage. What’s more, it was now at the Epic stage. It had a high chance of defeating Origin Realm King.</p>
<p>Time ticked by. Origin Realm King hadn’t accepted the challenge. In the blink of an eye, less than an hour was left.</p>
<p>“What? Origin Realm King is just stalling for time. It looks like there’s zero suspense left. First place will undoubtedly go to Origin Realm King.”</p>
<p>“Origin Realm King is really too powerful. An existence like Death of the Underworld was actually killed by it. It didn’t even have the chance to forfeit. Did you see what happened? What’s up with that flower? The moment it appeared, it sucked in Death of the Underworld. I wonder what kind of ability it is.”</p>
<p>“I should have known. Even Primordial Sword Immortal isn’t a match for Origin Realm King, much less Death of the Underworld.”</p>
<p>Almost everyone believed that there was no longer any suspense in this battle. Without a doubt, Original Realm King was first, and the remaining time would be wasted.</p>
<p>After Tai Sui was defeated, there wouldn’t be enough time left to challenge it. Even if one had a Companion Beast that could fight Origin Realm King, they wouldn’t be given the chance.</p>
<p>However, some people didn’t think so. Leng Zongzheng had seen Zhou Wen’s Tai Sui before and knew that Tai Sui was very effective against microorganisms. Furthermore, he had clearly determined that Origin Realm King was a microorganism.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, he got lucky. Your family’s Zhou Wen sure is lucky,” Leng Zongzheng said to An Tianzuo as he watched the livestream.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo replied expressionlessly, “Humans can’t just rely on luck. If we only rely on luck, we will suffer a huge loss sooner or later.”</p>
<p>Leng Zongzheng said with a smile, “Actually, luck is similar to money. Money isn’t omnipotent, but it’s impossible without money.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>There was less than half an hour left. Origin Realm King still hadn’t accepted the challenge. Everyone believed that Origin Realm King would accept the challenge at the last moment. Then, with less than ten minutes left before the countdown ended, its first place would then be secured.</p>
<p>Origin Realm King still didn’t accept the challenge in the final moments. Despite having less than ten seconds on the clock, it still didn’t make a move. It made people feel that something was amiss.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? Why hasn’t it accepted the challenge?”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to keep our hearts racing, right? Does it want to accept the challenge at the last second?”</p>
<p>“Could it be afraid of Tai Sui?”</p>
<p>“What a joke. How is that possible? That’s Origin Realm King!”</p>
<p>“Seven… Six… Five… Four…”</p>
<p>Everyone counted silently with the countdown in their hearts, but even at the last second, Origin Ream King didn’t accept the challenge.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the first ranked Origin Realm King’s name being squeezed out and replaced by Tai Sui’s name, the entire Federation and those overseas were in an uproar.</p>
<p>“Origin Realm King doesn’t dare accept the challenge? Is Tai Sui that strong?”</p>
<p>“Tai Sui… What kind of Companion Beast is this?”</p>
<p>“I knew that Tai Sui was extraordinary, but I didn’t say anything.”</p>
<p>“Facing Primordial Sword Immortal and Death of the Underworld, Origin Realm King can definitely suppress them, but it didn’t dare accept Tai Sui’s challenge. It doesn’t even have the courage to fight. That Tai Sui is too terrifying. I really want to know what kind of abilities it has!”</p>
<p>“What bullsh*t is this Tai Sui? I think it’s all a scam. They’re in cahoots.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. Origin Realm King was already first. If they are in cahoots, there’d be no need to admit defeat and let Tai Sui take first place.”</p>
<p>As everyone was discussing, they saw another Companion Beast issue a challenge. However, Tai Sui ignored it. It didn’t accept the challenge even when the 72-hour countdown on the cube ended.</p>
<p>The scene on the cube turned into a ranking. Tai Sui was first, and the defeated Origin Realm King was second. Third was Primordial Sword Immortal, and fourth was Zhou Wen’s Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>This continued until the hundredth spot. The names of the Companion Beasts emitted a resplendent glow. It made the entire world know that they were the strongest hundred Companion Beasts among humans.</p>
<p>However, most people did not realize that Tai Sui, who was ranked first, had yet to advance to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>“Mommy, Tai Sui is so cute. I want a Tai Sui doll. Can our family’s factory produce one?” A little boy hugging a Tyrant Behemoth doll looked at his mother with anticipation.</p>
<p>“This…” His mother was somewhat hesitant. Although Tai Sui looked adorable, it seemed a little ominous.</p>
<p>“Mommy, our Tyrant Behemoth doll has been very popular. I believe Tai Sui will also sell very well. Pretty please?” The boy pulled his mother’s hand and wheedled.</p>
<p>“Alright… Let’s give it a try…” His mother stroked the boy’s head dotingly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter708'>Chapter 708: Reward</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The hundred names on the cube lit up. Zhou Wen suddenly felt a huge amount of energy appear out of nowhere in the bodies of his three Companion Beasts on the rankings—Tai Sui, Tyrant Behemoth, and Six-Winged Guardian Dragon.</p>
<p>The least energy appeared in Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s body. It didn’t result in much of a change. The energy in Tyrant Behemoth’s body was extremely huge, causing Tyrant Behemoth’s body to constantly stir.</p>
<p>The most powerful energy was inside Tai Sui’s body. The immense power turned Tai Sui into an egg and it began to evolve.</p>
<p>So there are benefits for all the Companion Beasts on the rankings. They can obtain a strange energy. However, the higher the ranking, the stronger the energy obtained. As Zhou Wen thought about it, he looked at Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s situation.</p>
<p>As it had obtained very little energy, it had completely absorbed it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took out his phone and checked Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s stats. To his surprise, Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s Strength stat had reached 81 points.</p>
<p>After being strengthened by the cube the last time, all of Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s stats had reached 80 points, but that was all. They were still within the limits of Mythical creatures.</p>
<p>This time, the energy obtained by Six-Winged Guardian Dragon allowed its Strength to break through to 81 points. Although it was only one point, it was very significant. This was because only a top Mythical creature had stats with 81 points.</p>
<p>As Six-Winged Guardian Dragon had never accepted challenges, its ranking kept dropping when it was challenged by other Companion Beasts. It had ended up in the seventies. For such a ranking to increase its stat by one point was amazing enough.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t wait to see Tyrant Behemoth. He wanted to know what kind of strengthening it had obtained. It was ranked fourth, so the energy it obtained would be immense. It was incomparable to the energy that Six-Winged Guardian Dragon had received.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen looked at Behemoth, he realized that the power in its body was constantly erupting. Its stats hadn’t changed for the time being.</p>
<p>After more than an hour, the energy in Behemoth gradually stopped erupting. Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at its stats.</p>
<p>Behemoth’s stats were top-notch to begin with. Now, it remained unchanged at 81 points.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully looked at Tyrant Behemoth’s Life Providence, Life Soul, and Wheel of Destiny. There were no changes either. When Zhou Wen saw Behemoth’s talent skills, he was immediately overjoyed.</p>
<p>Originally, Tyrant only had one talent skill—Mountain Consuming. But now, Tyrant Behemoth had an additional skill. The skill’s name was “Rampage.”</p>
<p>After reading the introduction of the Rampage skill, Zhou Wen was even more excited. This skill could enhance its Speed and Strength for a short period of time. It was very useful for Tyrant Behemoth, allowing its strength to improve further.</p>
<p>If I had known that there would be so many benefits, I would have gotten all my Companion Beasts to get a ranking. Even if I can’t obtain any talent skills, it’s good to increase their stats.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen was only musing. It wasn’t worth it to expose his Companion Beast’s abilities to exchange for stats.</p>
<p>The skills obtained by Tyrant Behemoth were just icing on the cake. It didn’t have an absolute effect on Tyrant Behemoth’s strength. The one with the greatest influence was Tai Sui who was evolving.</p>
<p>The immense energy allowed Tai Sui to directly evolve. By the time it completed its evolution, it would be at the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>In addition, Tai Sui had obtained first place. He likely had a chance of plucking the divine fruit, but Zhou Wen didn’t discover the passageway that led to the divine tree.</p>
<p>Just as he was feeling suspicious, he saw a pillar of light rise from the center of the cube, leading straight into the void.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was hesitating about walking towards the pillar of light when he suddenly realized that a figure was slowly descending from it. It was none other than the Mythical Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan slowly landed on the cube and said to Zhou Wen, “I never expected the Companion Beast that obtained first place to be yours, Little Wen.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Wang Mingyuan and was momentarily at a loss for words.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan was his teacher and had treated him pretty well. In this aspect, Zhou Wen should respect him.</p>
<p>However, at the same time, Wang Mingyuan had caused great harm to the Federation. From this angle, Wang Mingyuan was already an enemy of humanity. Zhou Wen was a part of humanity, so he should treat Wang Mingyuan as an enemy.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen’s emotions were extremely complicated. He looked at Wang Mingyuan and opened his mouth before calling out, “Teacher.”</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan could tell that Zhou Wen was struggling internally, but he thought nothing of it. He smiled slightly and said, “I’m already very gratified that you can call me teacher again. Come, pluck the reward you deserve.”</p>
<p>With that said, Wang Mingyuan walked up the pillar of light. At the end of the pillar of light, a phenomenon of a divine garden appeared. The divine tree also appeared.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed behind Wang Mingyuan and walked into the pillar of light. Immediately, he felt a gentle force envelop his body as he slowly rose up and headed for the divine garden at the end of the pillar.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen followed Wang Mingyuan into the garden and immediately smelled a fruity fragrance.</p>
<p>The air in the divine garden was clean and pure. Even with the Holy Hell King’s eyes, he couldn’t sense any impurities. There was no dust or bacteria. It was like the legendary Paradise.</p>
<p>Here, even if one wanted to get sick, it was probably very difficult. There was no way to get infected.</p>
<p>“Do you know the name of this tree?” Wang Mingyuan walked to the divine tree and stared at it with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>“Is its name important?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“To ordinary people, its name isn’t important, but to me, its name is very important,” Wang Mingyuan said.</p>
<p>“What’s its name?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Its name is Samsara,” Wang Mingyuan said slowly.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Samsara? Zhou Wen looked at the Samsara Tree with mixed feelings as he thought to himself, If there’s really samsara in this world, will Teacher make the same choice in this life if he were to live again?</p>
<p>“Little Wen, go pluck that divine fruit. This is the only ripened divine fruit in the past year. It can allow any Companion Beast to advance to the Mythical stage. Even if it’s just a Mortal Companion Beast, as long as it consumes the divine fruit, it can still advance to the Mythical stage,” Wang Mingyuan said.</p>
<p>Although he had guessed it, Zhou Wen still asked, “What if a human eats it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think you will like that outcome.” Wang Mingyuan smiled and continued, “Of course, you can also give it a try. There are some things that you have to experience before you know whether they’re good for you. There’s not much time left. Quickly pluck the divine fruit and don’t let it fall to the ground. Otherwise, it will be useless.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked to the Samsara Tree and reached out to grab the ripened fruit. With a gentle tug, he plucked off the fruit.</p>
<h3 id='chapter709'>Chapter 709: Dimensional Axis</h3>
<p>The fruit that emitted a divine glow felt similar to a peach when held in his hand.</p>
<p>“Teacher, have you realized your dream?” Zhou Wen put away the fruit and asked Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>“If it’s so easy to realize it, it wouldn’t be called a dream.” Wang Mingyuan pondered for a moment and pointed into the distance. “Look over there.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked in the direction Wang Mingyuan had pointed and saw a huge building in the void. It was extremely strange, like a pillar that emitted a divine glow. It was unimaginably huge.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“The Dimensional Axis. Its existence connects Earth to dimensional zones,” Wang Mingyuan said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up. “If we can sever the connection to the Dimensional Axis, will we be able to stop the invasion of dimensional creatures?”</p>
<p>“In theory, it’s indeed feasible. However, there’s more than one Dimensional Axis. It connects different dimensional spaces. Every Dimensional Axis is the core of a dimensional space. Almost all the most terrifying dimensional creatures will gather here, making it very difficult to reach it. Besides, a Dimensional Axis can connect to dimensional zones. It’s not that easy to destroy it,” Wang Mingyuan said.</p>
<p>“Teacher, you have already thought of a solution, right?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I’ve indeed thought of a way to sever the Dimensional Axis, but I don’t plan on severing it,” Wang Mingyuan said.</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen was stunned.</p>
<p>“I thought of a solution, but it takes too long to implement it. I’m afraid Earth would already be occupied by dimensional creatures before I can ever sever a Dimensional Axis. Therefore, I don’t plan on severing it,” Wang Mingyuan said as he narrowed his eyes at the Dimensional Axis.</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>No matter how difficult it was, there was still a chance as long as it was done. As for Wang Mingyuan, didn’t he enter the dimensional zone to stop the dimensional invasion? Why was he giving up now?</p>
<p>“In ancient times, floods were a perennial threat. Humans wanted to control floods. In the beginning, they tried building tall levees to block the flood. Do you know the outcome?” Wang Mingyuan asked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had heard of this myth before. The people who tried to stop the floods naturally failed. The higher the levee was, the stronger the flood. Once it breached the levee, it would cause a destructive force that was ten times or a hundred times greater.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up as he looked at Wang Mingyuan and said, “Teacher, do you mean to think of a way to guide dimensional creatures to other dimensional zones instead of rushing to Earth?”</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan looked at the Dimensional Axis calmly and said indifferently, “No, what I mean is that I want to control the flood. I want the flood to obey my orders. They will go wherever I tell them to go. They will do whatever I tell them to do. I will dominate everything.”</p>
<p>“Dominate the dimensional zones”? Zhou Wen’s heart stirred. If it was really as Wang Mingyuan had said, he would one day be able to ascend to the top of the myriad races and become an existence that controlled the dimensional zones. How delightful would that be?</p>
<p>However, this path was just too difficult. Even with Wang Mingyuan’s shocking talent, it was difficult for him to reach that stage.</p>
<p>“Little Wen.” Wang Mingyuan’s gaze landed on Zhou Wen’s face as he said with a strange tone, “Don’t take my path. There’s only death at the end of this path.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly asked, “Is there a problem with Spirit Casting?”</p>
<p>He was somewhat worried. With Zhong Ziya’s personality, there was a high chance that he would take this path. If there was really a problem with the Spirit Casting Art, Zhong Ziya would be in danger.</p>
<p>“There’s no problem with Spirit Casting, but this path isn’t for humans.” Wang Mingyuan sighed and waved his hand. A force swept towards Zhou Wen as he said, “Don’t come again next time. You shouldn’t be in a place like this.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was about to say something when his body was sent into the void by an invisible force. The light in front of him changed and by the time his body returned to normal, he had already fallen onto the town’s cube.</p>
<p>He stood up and looked up into the sky, but the pillar of light was gone. He found it indescribable.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan’s last sentence had hinted at something. If he wasn’t Wang Mingyuan’s student, he might not have plucked the divine fruit so easily.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen still didn’t know what the person who obtained the divine fruit in his place would do or what they needed to do.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen left, Wang Mingyuan sat on the tree’s root and closed his eyes as though he was deep in thought.</p>
<p>In the void above the pure land, lightning and thunder suddenly flared. It was as though the end of the world had arrived. A terrifying divine voice sounded from the void.</p>
<p>“Wang Mingyuan, you actually dared to violate the agreement. You should know the consequences.”</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan’s eyes remained closed as he said indifferently, “Since I’ve done it, I’ll naturally bear all the consequences.”</p>
<p>“Very good. Then prepare to suffer divine punishment.” A terrifying lightning bolt descended along with the divine voice.</p>
<p>Bolts of lightning descended from the void and stabbed into Wang Mingyuan’s body like sharp swords. Thrust after thrust, they filled his entire body with lightning.</p>
<p>However, Wang Mingyuan sat there without any change in expression. It was as though the lightning bolts that stabbed into his body didn’t exist at all. However, blood-red spots appeared on his white clothes like blooming peach blossoms.</p>
<p>“The divine punishment will continue until the next divine fruit ripens. I hope you will still be alive when that happens.” The voice in the void faded and the lightning in the sky vanished.</p>
<p>The paradise returned to its original silence. Only the lightning on Wang Mingyuan’s body sparked like countless lightning needles as they trembled.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen returned to school and took out the divine fruit, but he was somewhat hesitant.</p>
<p>There was only one divine fruit, and its use was to raise a Companion Beast to the Mythical stage. He naturally didn’t need to consider the Companion Beasts that had already advanced to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Among the Companion Beasts that had yet to advance to the Mythical stage, Demonic Neonate had the greatest potential.</p>
<p>However, Demonic Neonate had the ability to evolve. It was only a matter of time before she advanced to the Mythical stage. And the greatest use of the divine fruit was to allow any Companion Egg to advance to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>From this point of view, it was best to choose a low-level Companion Beast with immense potential to advance to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen really had a few Companion Beasts with such potential. For example, Doctor Darkness, Golden Harp, Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, and so on. All of them had immense potential.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen wouldn’t dare raise the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General again. He eliminated it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s idea was to choose between Doctor Darkness and Golden Harp. However, this was also risky. This was because he didn’t know if the Wheel of Destiny they condensed after advancing to the Mythical stage would be of any use. If it condensed a useless Wheel of Destiny, he might as well directly advance Demonic Neonate to the Mythical stage. Her being at the Mythical stage was definitely going to be extraordinary, allowing her to immediately possess powerful combat strength.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat hesitant as he was momentarily at a loss.</p>
<h3 id='chapter710'>Chapter 710: Darkness Right Hand</h3>

<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Explosive Fiend Man hasn’t advanced to the Epic stage yet. He would be a pretty good choice for advancing to the Mythical stage. However, Explosive Fiend Man has the ability to evolve. He still has a chance of advancing to the Mythical stage in the future… After some thought, Zhou Wen summoned Doctor Darkness.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness’s abilities were rather outstanding. Furthermore, with his Fight Poison With Poison ability, he could resolve many problems that ordinary powers couldn’t resolve. More importantly, Doctor Darkness’s companion form was a soul. It could directly raise Zhou Wen’s strength. This was very useful to him.</p>
<p>If Doctor Darkness could advance to the Mythical stage, he would probably be more helpful.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, he handed the divine fruit to Doctor Darkness.</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness took the divine fruit and his eyes flashed with excitement as he swallowed it.</p>
<p>His body immediately emitted a divine glow. The glow grew stronger and stronger before finally turning Doctor Darkness into an egg.</p>
<p>Unlike the evolution of typical Companion Beasts in which ordinary Companion Beasts took a long time to evolve, Doctor Darkness immediately completed the evolution after transforming into an egg and hatching. In a moment, he completed the evolution from the Epic stage to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>The Doctor Darkness in front of him didn’t seem much different from before. He was still as dark and terrifying, like a puppet without a shred of humanity.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly took out his phone and read the information regarding Doctor Darkness post-evolution.</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness: Mythical</p>
<p>Life Providence: Golden Left Hand</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Life Soul: Dr. Soul</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Darkness Right Hand</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Strength: 79</p>
<p>Speed: 81</p>
<p>Constitution: 67</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 81</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Scalpel, Fight Poison With Poison, Light of Penetration</p>
<p>Companion Form: Soul</p>
<p>Indeed, Doctor Darkness had advanced to the Mythical stage. His skills, Life Providence, and Life Soul hadn’t changed. His stats had increased to the Mythical stage, albeit a little extreme.</p>
<p>Typically, a Mythical Companion Beast’s limit was 80 points. Doctor Darkness’s Speed and Essence Energy had broken through the limit to 81 points.</p>
<p>However, his Strength and Constitution hadn’t even reached 80. It was very strange.</p>
<p>The Wheel of Destiny’s name was Darkness Right Hand. It seemed to match his Life Providence, Golden Left Hand, but the ability was unknown.</p>
<p>Darkness Right Hand: A place where even divine light can’t reach. That is the forbidden zone of the Gods.</p>
<p>From the introduction, it didn’t seem to have anything to do with his right hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen entered the game and planned on testing the power of Darkness Right Hand.</p>
<p>He brought Doctor Darkness to the Zhuolu battlefield and encountered a Chi. Zhou Wen immediately ordered Doctor Darkness, “Use Darkness Right Hand.”</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness stood there and watched as the Chi ran over. He slowly raised his right hand.</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness had the Golden Left Hand Life Providence. Be it his Strength or Speed, his left hand was much stronger than his right hand.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen got Doctor Darkness to attach himself to him as a soul, he could clearly sense that the Strength and Speed of his left hand had been enhanced.</p>
<p>During that period of time, Zhou Wen had deliberately practiced striking with his left hand because it was much faster than striking with his right hand.</p>
<p>All along, Doctor Darkness’s right hand had been weaker, but when Doctor Darkness raised his right hand, it seemed to have the power of a devil burning over it like black flames.</p>
<p>The Chi had already rushed in front of Doctor Darkness, but Doctor Darkness remained motionless. Only when the Chi was about to collide with him did Doctor Darkness slightly tilt his body and dodge the Chi’s charge, allowing it to brush past him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept staring at Doctor Darkness’s hand, but he didn’t see any movement from it. When he saw Doctor Darkness brush past the Chi, he was puzzled as to why he hadn’t attacked.</p>
<p>However, when Doctor Darkness turned around, Zhou Wen’s pupils constricted upon seeing his right hand.</p>
<p>In Doctor Darkness’s right hand was a bloody heart that was still beating.</p>
<p>The Chi ran a few steps before letting out a tragic cry. It suddenly fell to the ground and convulsed. Soon, it died.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the Chi’s corpse and didn’t see any injuries. He had no idea how Doctor Darkness had plucked its heart out.</p>
<p>Even I couldn’t see how Doctor Darkness did it. Furthermore, its strength is too strange. It can actually pluck out a heart without dealing any injuries… No… I have to watch it again… Zhou Wen continued proceeding forward with Doctor Darkness.</p>
<p>Before long, he encountered a Wangliang.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen didn’t only maximize the Truth Listener earring’s abilities, but he also switched to the Holy Hell King Life Soul, raising his senses to their limits.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen got Doctor Darkness to rush over and quickly he brushed past the Wangliang.</p>
<p>At that instant, Zhou Wen felt his devil-like right hand move.</p>
<p>As it was too fast, Zhou Wen only felt it move a little. He didn’t see it clearly.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was certain that the right hand had definitely moved. This was because there was something white on the right hand. It was like a pig’s brain, and the blood vessels on it were still squirming.</p>
<p>How terrifying! Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>The power of Darkness Right Hand could actually remove organs in an invisible manner. It was so fast that even Zhou Wen couldn’t see it clearly. Such an ability made his scalp tingle.</p>
<p>In the future, if Zhou Wen didn’t like anyone, he could get Doctor Darkness to pluck at their waist. If anyone pissed him off, he could pluck out their hearts, livers, and brains. It would scare him to death.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if Darkness Right Hand’s ability was merely fast or if it had any special effects.</p>
<p>The Chi and Wangliang weren’t injured; yet, their heart and brain had been removed. Perhaps Doctor Darkness’s Darkness Right Hand wasn’t as simple as being fast.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to experiment further, so he went to the Metalwork Temple to find a Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior with extremely powerful defense. The outcome was the same. After Doctor Darkness used Darkness Right Hand, he easily plucked out the heart. The Runic Heavy Armor was useless. Even the runic patterns on it didn’t light up.</p>
<p>Amazing. The Darkness Right Hand actually has the ability to penetrate through space. It can ignore defense and directly pluck out organs… Zhou Wen was even more excited.</p>
<p>With Doctor Darkness’s ability, Zhou Wen could ignore dimensional creatures with powerful defense.</p>
<p>More importantly, Doctor Darkness’s companion form was a soul. He could attach himself to Zhou Wen and allow him to use his abilities. In other words, Zhou Wen could also use Darkness Right Hand. This was equivalent to strengthening Zhou Wen’s strength and abilities.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen still wanted to give it another try, but he was depressed. He couldn’t use Darkness Right Hand again. After some research, he learned that Darkness Right Hand could only be used three times in twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>Three times is enough. I’ll pluck the kidney before plucking the heart. If that still doesn’t work, I’ll pluck the brain. I don’t believe anyone can survive, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter711'>Chapter 711: Snatching Blood, Condensing Soul</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>He attempted to get Doctor Darkness to attach himself to the blood-colored avatar as a soul. Zhou Wen immediately felt his physical attributes increase, especially his left hand. After advancing to the Mythical stage, the Golden Left Hand Life Providence augmented Zhou Wen’s left hand even more.</p>
<p>After using all of Doctor Darkness’s skills, he realized that the effects of his skills had increased significantly. Fight Poison With Poison’s poison became even more potent. A single milliliter of poison could instantly kill an Epic creature, even when it was a venomous creature like the Chi.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>The destructive power of Scalpel became stronger and it was sharper.</p>
<p>The enhancement of the Eyes of Penetration was the greatest. The ability to see through things had been enhanced. It wasn’t as troublesome as before; yet, the effects had increased significantly. It was very easy to see through every minute detail inside a creature’s body.</p>
<p>As long as Zhou Wen used the Eyes of Penetration, he could see the creatures’ meridians and blood vessels clearly. However, he could only see through lifeforms; his ability to see through objects like metal was very poor.</p>
<p>All that’s left is to experiment with Darkness Right Hand. If everything goes well, I might be able to enter Ant City and obtain the blood of that Guardian. Zhou Wen was somewhat excited.</p>
<p>Since Darkness Right Hand could dig out hearts across space, it might be able to dig out a Guardian’s heart. When that happened, it wouldn’t just be a drop of blood.</p>
<p>After waiting for twenty-four hours, it was finally time for Darkness Right Hand to be used again. Zhou Wen got Doctor Darkness to possess the blood-colored avatar and he carefully studied the abilities of Darkness Right Hand.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen experienced it personally, he concluded that Darkness Right Hand was indeed extremely powerful. It augmented his right hand’s speed greatly. At the same time, this augmentation wasn’t on speed alone, it also had the ability to pass through matter.</p>
<p>From his tests, there was nothing that could block or prevent Darkness Right Hand from entering.</p>
<p>The ability of Darkness Right Hand didn’t only remove organs. As long as it was a region the right hand could enter, it could pluck anything.</p>
<p>However, Darkness Right Hand also had a flaw. Just like the Poison Dragon Palm, it required the palm to touch the opponent’s body to be of use. This skill couldn’t be used as a long-range attack.</p>
<p>I thought I could pluck hearts from afar using my right hand to reach into the Guardian’s body. I wonder if I can do it with the speed of Darkness Right Hand? Zhou Wen wasn’t confident.</p>
<p>Although Darkness Right Hand was very fast, the Guardian of Ant City was also extremely fast.</p>
<p>Even if there’s no way to pluck the Guardian’s heart, the ability of Darkness Right Hand is very useful. If a dimensional creature like Primordial Spore invades the body and can’t be resolved with Fight Poison With Poison, I can rely on Darkness Right Hand to extract it from the body. Also, this ability is undoubtedly a divine skill for doctors. Surgery can be performed without cutting up bodies. Unfortunately, I’m not a doctor.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gave his last usage of Darkness Right Hand to Medusa.</p>
<p>After Medusa respawned, Zhou Wen entered Medusa’s palace. This time, he didn’t get Demonic Neonate to help. With the speed of Darkness Right Hand, he managed to pluck out her heart before Medusa’s Demon God Transformation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Medusa didn’t drop a Companion Egg this time. All she dropped was a Speed Crystal.</p>
<p>With my hand’s speed, I might really have a chance of obtaining the blood of a Guardian. I don’t need a heart. Just a drop of blood will be enough. Zhou Wen felt hope again.</p>
<p>After waiting for another twenty-four hours so that Darkness Right Hand could be used again, Zhou Wen entered Ant City and arrived at the familiar ant nest.</p>
<p>With the Golden Flying Ant easily killed, Zhou Wen arrived in front of the Guardian cocoon. However, this time, he had no intention of cracking open the cocoon. Instead, he got Doctor Darkness to possess him and directly used the Eyes of Penetration.</p>
<p>With his penetrative vision, Zhou Wen immediately saw the situation inside the cocoon.</p>
<p>The Guardian was curled up in the cocoon. Her body was already rather mature, and the thin wings on her back had completely taken form. Her body emitted a strange glow.</p>
<p>The Guardian sensed that she was being looked at and moved.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare hesitate as he used Darkness Right Hand. His right hand seemed to be enveloped by a devilish power as it instantly vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that everything in front of his right hand seemed to turn to water. His right hand easily passed through the cocoon and reached for the Guardian’s heart.</p>
<p>Darkness Right Hand was just too fast, but the Guardian opened her eyes first and grabbed at it.</p>
<p>However, the Guardian missed as Darkness Right Hand passed through her palm.</p>
<p>Changing his plans, Zhou Wen didn’t aim for her heart. He directly took a drop of blood from her palm and quickly retracted.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen retracted his Darkness Right Hand and switched to Lost Country. He teleported to distance himself before rushing out of Ant City at full speed.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen rushed out of Ant City, the underground space in Ant City exploded, instantly turning into ruins.</p>
<p>Not daring to turn his head, he controlled the blood-colored avatar to run as he circulated the First Order of Chaos, the drop of blood in hand. He hoped to see if he could absorb it.</p>
<p>The drop of blood was immediately absorbed when the First Order of Chaos circulated. As the First Order of Chaos circulated, it gradually underwent a strange change.</p>
<p>Can I finally condense a Life Soul? In that case, I might be able to rehatch the Invisibility Cloak’s Companion Egg. After Zhou Wen absorbed the blood, he switched instance dungeons to prevent the Guardian from chasing after him.</p>
<p>The First Order of Chaos constantly circulated. With the drop of Guardian’s blood as its foundation, it fused with Zhou Wen’s essence, vitality, and spirit, nurturing a strange power.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that the First Order of Chaos would be similar to the Life Soul condensed by the Dao Sutra. After all, both of them used the blood of the same Guardian. Furthermore, the type of Essence Energy Art was very similar.</p>
<p>However, when the First Order of Chaos truly condensed a Life Soul, Zhou Wen realized that his guess wasn’t accurate. Although the two shared similarities, they were two different Essence Energy Arts after all.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s essence, vitality, and spirit, as well as Essence Energy fused together. Like a terrifying explosion, it made Zhou Wen’s body and mind tremble.</p>
<p>In the next second, Zhou Wen realized that the blood-colored avatar’s body had turned into an egg.</p>
<p>No, it wasn’t that the blood-colored avatar had turned into an egg, but that a barrier that resembled an eggshell had formed around it.</p>
<p>An eggshell? What Life Soul is this? Zhou Wen felt odd as he looked at the information on his phone. He saw the words “Chaos Egg” written in his Life Soul column.</p>
<p>It’s really an egg! Zhou Wen was somewhat curious. He didn’t know what special effects the Chaos Egg Life Soul would have.</p>
<h3 id='chapter712'>Chapter 712: Incubating the Invisibility Cloak</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the Chaos Egg in reality, and an eggshell immediately enveloped his body, making him appear as a newborn baby constrained within.</p>
<p>Inside the Chaos Egg, there was a mysterious force flowing. It was like water, but it wasn’t corporeal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t move, nor did he know what use this eggshell had.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, Zhou Wen couldn’t even move, much less fight. Such a Life Soul was probably useless in battle.</p>
<p>I’ll ignore it for now. I’ll try hatching the Invisibility Cloak. Zhou Wen took out the Invisibility Cloak’s Companion Egg and attempted to hatch it.</p>
<p>In the chaos egg, Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy stirred, and the Invisibility Cloak Companion Egg reacted. What was even more magical was that the strange power in the Chaos Egg also flowed into the Invisibility Cloak egg.</p>
<p>The life force in the Invisibility Cloak Companion Egg increased in intensity. Before long, the Companion Egg transformed into a stream of light that entered Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>It’s done! Zhou Wen was overjoyed. After waiting for so long, he had finally hatched the Invisibility Cloak. It would be much easier for him to go anywhere in the future.</p>
<p>With the Invisibility Cloak, he could freely enter the dimensional zones controlled by the various families. He had long wanted to visit a few dimensional zones, but because they were controlled by the six families, he had no chance of entering them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen already knew the Invisibility Cloak’s stats which remained unchanged. He summoned it and put it on. A magical scene happened as Zhou Wen’s body vanished into thin air. It was true invisibility.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen experimented and realized that the Invisibility Cloak’s ability only made him visually invisible. To truly be invisible, he needed to activate the Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>Once the Wheel of Destiny was activated, Invisibility Cloak lived up to its name and reached an intangible state. No one could discover Zhou Wen’s presence.</p>
<p>However, the Wheel of Destiny had a time limit. He could only be truly invisible for three minutes.</p>
<p>Three minutes is about enough. With Doctor Darkness’s Darkness Right Hand, it won’t be difficult to assassinate someone. Zhou Wen’s heart suddenly stirred.</p>
<p>In the past, he couldn’t kill the nine black dragons because they could combine their powers. Now, with the power of the Invisibility Cloak and Darkness Right Hand, he could completely conceal himself and aim to kill three black dragons first. He could mostly rely on the strength of Tyrant Behemoth, Truth Listener, and the other Companion Beasts to deal with the remaining six black dragons.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen couldn’t wait to give it a try. Unfortunately, he had just used Darkness Right Hand once, so he only had two chances to use it. He had to wait for some time before the cooldown ended</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, something happened to Deputy Governor Qin. Can you come over?” An Sheng spoke over the phone in a heavy tone.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with Deputy Governor Qin? Is there anything I can help you with?” Zhou Wen had a rather good impression of Qin Wufu, so he hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>An Sheng said, “Deputy Governor Qin returned to Chess Mountain to preside over it the past few days. He happened to encounter a break-out creature that rushed out of Chess Mountain and engaged in an intense battle. Deputy Governor Qin was heavily injured. We have done everything we can but to no avail. We hope to use your strength to save Deputy Governor Qin.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know any medicine. I used the power of a Companion Beast back when I treated the parasitic spores,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“We want to borrow your Companion Beast’s strength. That’s our only hope. I’ll pick you up now. We’ll talk on the way.” As An Sheng spoke, he had already arrived outside the school.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen left school and got into An Sheng’s car. As An Sheng drove, he told Zhou Wen the general situation.</p>
<p>In fact, many experts in the Sunset Army had already made a diagnosis of Qin Wufu’s injuries and found the reason for his serious injuries, but no one could save him.</p>
<p>A strange dimensional creature had drilled into Qin Wufu’s brain. It was like a tumor that extended out blood vessels that intertwined with Qin Wufu’s brain matter.</p>
<p>Unless Qin Wufu’s brain was sliced open, it was impossible to extract the dimensional creature from his brain.</p>
<p>However, the brain was fragile. The dimensional creature had already penetrated deep into it and was entrenched in his brain. Even Chancellor Leng was unable to get it out without damaging Qin Wufu’s brain.</p>
<p>Many experts and specialists in the Sunset Army had thought of many solutions, but none of them would be effective.</p>
<p>However, if they ignored the dimensional creature, it would continue invading Qin Wufu’s brain. It was very likely that it would completely control Qin Wufu’s brain and turn him into a puppet.</p>
<p>An Sheng’s idea was to let Zhou Wen take a look and see if he could use the method of treating the parasitic spores to inject poison into the dimensional creature, causing it to die automatically.</p>
<p>“The poison itself might affect Deputy Governor Qin’s brain. Furthermore, I wonder how poison resistant the dimensional creature is. There’s no way to accurately apply the dosage with the poison. If too much poison is used, it will damage the brain. If too little is used, the dimensional creature’s final struggle might destroy the entire brain…” Zhou Wen pondered.</p>
<p>An Sheng nodded and said, “Actually, the experts have already analyzed this plan of treatment. Just as you said, it’s very dangerous, but at this stage, we can only give it a try. We can’t just watch idly as Deputy Governor Qin gets destroyed, right?”</p>
<p>“Let’s take a look at the situation first. There might be a way.” Zhou Wen surmised that Darkness Right Hand might be useful, but it was situation-dependent.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s head over now.” An Sheng drove all the way to the military hospital.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw Qin Wufu, who was already unconscious, on the bed. He was connected to all sorts of instruments, and some strange Companion Beasts were by his side.</p>
<p>A Companion Beast that resembled a jellyfish wrapped around his head. Its tentacles connected to his brain, but it was unknown what use it had.</p>
<p>Beside the bed were a few doctors and nurses. Many officers were in the room next door, looking at Qin Wufu through the glass window. An Tianzuo was among them, and his expression looked terrible.</p>
<p>“Overseer, Young Master Wen is here.” An Sheng led Zhou Wen into the room.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and An Tianzuo subconsciously glanced at each other before they involuntarily looked away.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo looked at An Sheng and was about to say something when the room was pushed open again. An officer walked over with an elder.</p>
<p>“Overseer, Mr. Dugu is here,” the officer reported.</p>
<p>“Mr. Dugu, please take a look at Deputy Governor Qin’s injuries,” An Tianzuo said to the elder.</p>
<p>The elder didn’t refuse. He looked at all the diagnostic information and some x-ray photos before saying, “It’s not impossible to eliminate the dimensional creatures in Deputy Governor Qin’s brain, but…”</p>
<p>“What conditions do you have?” An Tianzuo asked.</p>
<p>“Since Overseer is so straightforward, I won’t beat around the bush. I can revive Deputy Governor Qin given ten tonnes of refined Essence Gold,” the elder said confidently.</p>
<h3 id='chapter713'>Chapter 713: Extracting An Object From the Brain</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The expressions of the officers changed. The An family might not even produce ten tonnes of refined Essence Gold in three years.</p>
<p>An Sheng said, “Mr. Dugu, can you reduce it a little? Or can we use money and dimensional crystals to make up for the rest? As you know, the production of refined Essence Gold is very low. It’s really difficult for us to hand over ten tonnes of refined Essence Gold.”</p>
<p>The elder said with a smile, “Adjutant An, there’s no need to act poor in front of an old man like me. Who doesn’t know that the An family’s Essence Gold mine is the richest mine in the Federation? Ten tonnes of refined Essence Gold might be a huge sum to others, but it shouldn’t be much to the An family, right? I can guarantee that Deputy Governor Qin will enjoy a full recovery. You can rest assured about this. The Dugu family is an expert in this aspect. There’s no one else in the entire Federation who can guarantee you that.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Dugu…” An Sheng was about to say something when he was interrupted by the elder.</p>
<p>“Ten tonnes of refined Essence Gold, not one bit less. Why don’t you discuss it again? However, you have to be quick. If that dimensional creature injures the brain, even my Dugu family will be helpless,” the elder said.</p>
<p>Everyone knew that the Dugu family was trying to take advantage of the situation, but there was nothing they could do.</p>
<p>No one in Luoyang could treat Qin Wufu’s injuries. If they wanted Qin Wufu to live, this was probably the only way.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo’s eyes were resolute. Just as he was about to say something, An Sheng spoke first. “Overseer, let Young Master Wen take a look at Governor Qin’s injuries before making a decision.”</p>
<p>An Tianzuo fell silent as the elder beside him smiled confidently. “It’s fine. You can get anyone to come and take a look. I don’t dare say anything else, but in the field of microscopic Companion Beasts, no one will dare claim first if our Dugu family claims second. This dimensional creature that invaded his brain can only be eliminated by our Dugu family.”</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen.” An Sheng looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded and said, “I need to observe Governor Qin’s situation up close.”</p>
<p>An Sheng hurriedly led Zhou Wen to the ward. On the way to the ward, An Sheng whispered to Zhou Wen, “Young Master Wen, using ten tonnes of refined Essence Gold to save Governor Qin’s life is nothing. As long as we can save him, Overseer will be willing to pay anything. However, the research on the new Essence Gold weapons in the military factory is at a critical juncture. A large amount of refined Essence Gold is needed for experiments. Without this batch of Essence Gold, the research progress will be delayed for a year or more. This will deal a severe blow to Luoyang and the An family…”</p>
<p>“I’ll try my best,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>After reading the information, he had a general idea of what to do. However, the images taken by the instruments weren’t very clear. He still needed to use his Eyes of Penetration to take a clear look himself to ensure that nothing went wrong.</p>
<p>Standing beside Qin Wufu’s bed, Zhou Wen used his Eyes of Penetration to look at his brain.</p>
<p>A strange dimensional creature that looked like a blood vessel had invaded Qin Wufu’s brain. The blood vessels extended out like a fishing net that wrapped around a portion of his brain. Furthermore, it was still spreading.</p>
<p>Many blood vessels seemed to be part of the brain. It was difficult not to hurt the fragile brain if one wanted to remove it.</p>
<p>After watching for a while, Zhou Wen deactivated his Eyes of Penetration.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, what do you think?” An Sheng hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“I can do it.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>An Sheng was immediately overjoyed. He hurriedly turned and said to An Tianzuo, who was on the other side of the glass window, “Overseer, Young Master Wen said that he can be saved. Governor Qin, shall we get Young Master Wen to immediately rescue him?”</p>
<p>At this moment, the elder beside him said, “Overseer, you have to think carefully. That dimensional creature has already merged with Governor Qin’s brain. To eliminate it requires an extremely meticulous job. It also requires the cooperation of special microscopic Companion Beasts. Are you sure you want such a young man to do it? Ignoring the fact that he can’t eliminate it, even if he can, Governor Qin might end up a cripple if his brain is injured.”</p>
<p>An Tianzuo didn’t say a word after hearing the elder’s words. He walked to the glass window and stared at Zhou Wen. “Zhou Wen, can you ensure Governor Qin’s recovery?”</p>
<p>“I can only guarantee that I can eliminate the dimensional creature without harming Deputy Governor Qin’s brain. I can’t guarantee anything else,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“Young man, don’t be too blindly confident. Do you know what that dimensional creature is called? Do you know what kind of ability it has?” the elder said with a smile.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, nor do I need to know. I just need to know that I can eliminate it,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Overseer, did you hear that? What kind of statement is that? Do you really want to use such a person?” The elder laughed.</p>
<p>But soon, the elder’s smile froze. An Tianzuo directly said to Zhou Wen, “Immediately treat Deputy Governor Qin.”</p>
<p>“Overseer, isn’t your decision a little too rash? Or do you think Deputy Governor Qin’s life is more important than ten tonnes of refined Essence Gold? Wouldn’t this demoralize your subordinates?” the elder said with a smile. His words were clearly provoking the other officers.</p>
<p>He wanted to use the officers’ emotions to pressure An Tianzuo. Ten tonnes of refined Essence Gold were very important resources for the Dugu family.</p>
<p>The elder wasn’t afraid that Zhou Wen could treat Qin Wufu because he didn’t believe that Zhou Wen had the ability to do so. He was afraid that he would have no hope of obtaining the batch of refined Essence Gold if Zhou Wen killed Qin Wufu.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo didn’t answer the elder. He looked at an officer beside him and asked, “If you were Governor Qin, who would you choose to treat you?”</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen,” the officer answered without hesitation.</p>
<p>The elder’s expression changed slightly. Things seemed to be different from what he had imagined.</p>
<p>“What about you?” An Tianzuo asked another officer.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen,” the officer immediately answered.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo asked one by one, and all the officers chose Zhou Wen without any hesitation. There was no exception. From their expressions, it seemed like a forgone conclusion.</p>
<p>“Overseer, your methods of subordination are truly brilliant.” The elder held back the surprise in his heart. He had imagined that An Tianzuo had given strict orders, making them be willing to risk their lives without any complaints.</p>
<p>Although he said that, he couldn’t help but look at Zhou Wen in the ward. He thought to himself, Does he really have that ability?</p>
<p>However, when his gaze landed on Zhou Wen, his pupils constricted. He saw a strange dimensional creature formed from red threads in Zhou Wen’s hand. It was the dimensional creature in Qin Wufu’s head. Zhou Wen had already taken out the dimensional creature at some point in time, and it was alive.</p>
<p>“That’s impossible!” The elder wore a look of disbelief as he pressed his hands against the glass window. His eyes yearned to reach out to Zhou Wen, hoping to see if the dimensional creature in his hand was fake.</p>
<h3 id='chapter714'>Chapter 714: Worm Dugu</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The dimensional creature contorted as it attempted to burrow into Zhou Wen’s hand, but it was blocked by a force that prevented it.</p>
<p>The doctor brought over a specially tempered piece of glassware that he had prepared and Zhou Wen placed the dimensional creature inside.</p>
<p>It constantly twisted and slammed into the glass container, hoping to rush out. Unfortunately, it was too weak and couldn’t break through the tempered glass. Furthermore, there was an instrument made of Essence Gold above the glass container. It had a weakening effect on dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>The elder didn’t believe that Zhou Wen had really taken out the dimensional creature. He ran into the ward and wanted to examine Qin Wufu to confirm if the dimensional creature in his brain had really been taken out.</p>
<p>However, there was no need for a checkup. The elder knew that Zhou Wen wasn’t faking it. When he entered the ward, he saw that Qin Wufu had already woken up.</p>
<p>“Sorry for making everyone worry.” Although Qin Wufu was still weak, his brain seemed to be functioning normally. He could already speak.</p>
<p>“You are Young Master Wen, right? Can you tell me how you did it?” the elder asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“No,” Zhou Wen answered bluntly.</p>
<p>The elder was slightly taken aback as he carefully sized up Zhou Wen before continuing, “With Young Master Wen’s abilities, it would be a pity if he doesn’t join my Dugu family. Our Dugu family needs talented people. Young Master Wen, why don’t you consider it?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Dugu, isn’t it inappropriate for you to poach one of ours in front of our Overseer?” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“The Federation is a family. Young Master Wen, you really should consider our Dugu family. Otherwise, your ability will be wasted.” As the elder spoke, he cupped his hands at An Tianzuo and said, “I’ve broadened myself today. Thank you for the Overseer’s invitation. However, with Young Master Wen around, I’m afraid we won’t have many opportunities to cooperate in the future.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Dugu, you’re being too polite. There are still many opportunities for cooperation in the future,” said An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>Before the elder left, he gave Zhou Wen an additional glance.</p>
<p>Qin Wufu chatted with Zhou Wen for a while until the doctor told him to rest. Only then did Zhou Wen leave.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen arrived at the entrance, he saw An Sheng waiting for him in the car, but he didn’t see An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>“Overseer has something to attend to. He told me to take you back,” An Sheng said with a smile.</p>
<p>“It’s not far. I can go back myself,” Zhou Wen said as he got into the car.</p>
<p>“It’s mainly because there’s something I need to tell you. The person you saw just now is called Worm Dugu. He’s a member of the Dugu family. In terms of seniority, Dugu Ge has to call him second uncle. The Dugu family is adept at microscopic Companion Beasts, and this person is an expert in Gu-type Companion Beasts.” An Sheng explained the origins of Worm Dugu in detail.</p>
<p>“Why are you telling me this so solemnly? Could it be that there’s something wrong with this Worm Dugu?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, you are getting sharper. Although Governor Qin was injured because of the break-out creature at Chess Mountain, we still have our suspicions. Firstly, we haven’t seen such a dimensional creature in Chess Mountain before. Secondly, the Dugu family lives far away in the South District. It’s a coincidence that Worm Dugu happened to be in Luoyang. Although it might be a coincidence, it’s best to be careful,” An Sheng explained.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen understood what An Sheng meant. If the thing in Qin Wufu’s head was really put there by Worm Dugu, then with Zhou Wen ruining the plans, Worm Dugu probably wouldn’t give up easily.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, that white ball-like Companion Beast of yours is quite fun. Why don’t you let it out for some fresh air? Perhaps there will be an unexpected gain,” An Sheng said casually.</p>
<p>“I will.” Zhou Wen knew that An Sheng wanted him to use Tai Sui to prevent the invasion of Gu-type Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Tai Sui was still evolving. It was probably useless for the time being.</p>
<p>After returning to school, Zhou Wen summoned Primordial Spore and made it stand guard. Tai Sui was still evolving, so it was the only weapon that could deal with microscopic Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Under the surveillance of An Sheng’s men, Worm Dugu checked into a hotel. After dinner, he returned to his room to rest. He didn’t do anything strange.</p>
<p>Through the surveillance cameras, one could even see that Worm Dugu was sleeping in bed.</p>
<p>However, in a place they couldn’t see, a mosquito secretly flew out of the room, passing through the streets and heading for Sunset College at an unbelievable speed.</p>
<p>As Worm Dugu flew, he thought to himself, How can those fools from the An family defend against me? I want to see how capable Zhou Wen is to be able to extract the Blood Thread Brain-Eating Gu that was connected to his brain. Even if I were to take action, it would be impossible for me to pull it out as cleanly as him. With his ability, he’s practically a genius at raising Gu worms.</p>
<p>The mosquito-shaped Worm Dugu quickly arrived at Sunset College. After getting his bearings, he headed for Four Seasons Garden.</p>
<p>Others might not be able to find Zhou Wen’s location, but Worm Dugu had a smell-seeking Companion Beast. It could find Zhou Wen by searching for his remnant smells.</p>
<p>Soon, the mosquito-shaped Worm Dugu arrived outside Zhou Wen’s building. He sniffed and confirmed that this was Zhou Wen’s residence.</p>
<p>Worm Dugu landed in the grass on the yard and thought to himself, Let’s get my baby to test his strength first.</p>
<p>With a thought, he summoned a Companion Beast that looked like a spider. The spider was only the size of a fingernail and it was gray. One wouldn’t be able to see it if one didn’t pay attention.</p>
<p>The spider accepted the order from Worm Dugu and crawled towards Zhou Wen’s building. It crawled in through the crack in the door in a seemingly easy manner.</p>
<p>Just as Worm Dugu wanted to use the perspective of his spider Companion Beast to take a look at the situation inside the building so that he could pick up a strand of hair or a skin flake to proceed with the next step of the plan, the spider suddenly lost contact with him. Worm Dugu Worm didn’t even see a thing.</p>
<p>He’s indeed prepared. However, if he thinks that he can defend against me just because of some preparations, he is severely underestimating my Dugu family. Worm Dugu didn’t seem surprised. With a thought, he summoned some Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>This time, it wasn’t a spider, but an even smaller insect. It was like a black sesame seed, so small that it was almost indiscernible. There were many of them.</p>
<p>Under the control of Worm Dugu, the black sesame-like flying insects flew into the dormitory through the cracks in the door, windows, and so on.</p>
<p>Although my hundred or so Black Blood Gu are only at the Legendary stage, they can enter the bloodstream the moment they see it. As long as one is bitten by it, they will quickly reproduce in the blood. They can only be cured by me. I want to see if you have the ability to get these Black Blood Gu out as well, thought Dugu Gu.</p>
<h3 id='chapter715'>Chapter 715: Magical Hair Gu</h3>
<p>However, very quickly, Worm Dugu’s expression turned ugly. After the tiny Black Blood Gu entered the dorm, he lost contact with them one after another.</p>
<p>Originally, Worm Dugu believed that even if a portion of the more than a hundred Black Blood Gu was discovered, there would definitely be quite a number of them which successfully infiltrated. One was enough as long as it succeeded.</p>
<p>However, by the time Worm Dugu realized that something was amiss, more than a hundred Black Blood Gu was almost wiped out. He didn’t even know who killed the Black Blood Gu.</p>
<p>In the dorm, a golden chick flew around. As long as a Gu worm crawled in, it would eat them. No worm could come in alive.</p>
<p>Worm Dugu refused to believe it as he released his Companion Beasts one after another, trying his best to infiltrate Zhou Wen’s dorm.</p>
<p>However, no matter what kind of Companion Beast he released, he immediately lost contact with them the moment they entered Zhou Wen’s building. It was like a rock sinking into the sea.</p>
<p>I don’t believe that you can even kill my Magical Hair Gu. Worm Dugu had sacrificed many Companion Beasts, but he refused to have his beliefs shaken. He just wanted to win once in his competition with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>He did not realize that Zhou Wen had no idea what was happening in his dorm. He was lying in his bedroom on the second floor, grinding instance dungeons.</p>
<p>The moment Worm Dugu’s Companion Beasts entered the building, they entered the chick’s stomach without alarming Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Worm Dugu’s Magical Hair Gu was extraordinary. It was a Mythical dimensional creature.</p>
<p>That’s right. It was a dimensional creature, not a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>The truly powerful thing about the Dugu family was that they could tame dimensional creatures. Companion Beasts were secondary.</p>
<p>Magical Hair Gu was a dimensional creature that Worm Dugu had tamed himself. He had spent a lot of effort and nearly lost his life to subdue and tame it.</p>
<p>This Magical Hair Gu was a Mythical dimensional creature. Its abilities were very special. As long as it came into contact with the enemy’s body, it could parasitize their hair and use the power of their hair.</p>
<p>It could control the growth of hair in reverse, causing the hair to grow inside the brain and body, taking root in the brain and flesh. It was terrifying.</p>
<p>The hair absorbed the nutrients of the body, and in the end, all the flesh and blood in the body would be sucked dry. The interior would be filled with hair, leaving only a layer of human skin on the outside. This way of dying was extremely painful.</p>
<p>When Worm Dugu caught the Magical Hair Gu, he had almost died. It was only by chance that he had managed to subdue it.</p>
<p>A black thread thinner than a strand of hair appeared in front of Worm Dugu. As though it was a strand of hair that was blown by the wind, it swept into the building through the crack in the door.</p>
<p>Punk, when you know how powerful my Magical Hair Gu is, won’t you end up following me back to the South District and be my disciple? Dugu Gu felt that he could definitely deal with Zhou Wen by releasing such a powerful weapon.</p>
<p>He didn’t really want to do anything to Zhou Wen. All he wanted was to take him in as a disciple of the Dugu family and raise worms with him.</p>
<p>The main reason was that Zhou Wen’s method of extracting the Blood Thread Brain-Eating Gu was so shocking. Worm Dugu felt that such talent made him gifted at rearing Gu worms. It would be a pity if he didn’t do so.</p>
<p>The Dugu family was a true presence in the South District. However, the Dugu family didn’t just rear worms. In fact, they raised too many things.</p>
<p>As the drop rate of Companion Beasts was too low, especially Mythical Companion Eggs which were also difficult to find, the Dugu family did the opposite.</p>
<p>Killing a Mythical creature only gave one a certain chance of obtaining a Companion Egg. But, the chances weren’t high.</p>
<p>However, if they could tame a Mythical creature, it was equivalent to having a 100% chance of obtaining a pet.</p>
<p>Coupled with the research of ancient spells and generations of people, the Dugu family was unmatched in the Federation when it came to rearing strange dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>However, taming dimensional creatures was very dangerous. Furthermore, the dimensional creatures that the Dugu family domesticated were strange, making them even more dangerous. Many members of the Dugu family were killed by the dimensional creatures they domesticated.</p>
<p>In the eyes of Worm Dugu, Zhou Wen was born to nurture Gu worms. Therefore, he wanted to recruit him into the Dugu family.</p>
<p>Of course, if he was recruited into the Dugu family to learn the art of taming dimensional creatures, he had to first implant a Gu in Zhou Wen to prevent him from learning the Dugu family’s abilities only to end up dealing with the Dugu family.</p>
<p>However, Worm Dugu never expected that all the Companion Beasts he had sent in would die for no apparent reason. This was why he released his most precious Magical Hair Gu.</p>
<p>When it comes to worms, I, Worm Dugu, am an expert. Worm Dugu was thinking about what he would do when Zhou Wen came crying to him with black hair overgrowing everywhere.</p>
<p>The moment the Magical Hair Gu entered the building, it was discovered by the chick. However, this time, it didn’t immediately fly over. It stood on the table and watched as the Magical Hair Gu rolled towards the stairs on the second floor. It seemed to be hesitating.</p>
<p>Just as the Magical Hair Gu was about to roll to the side of the stairs, the chick finally moved. Like a golden bolt of lightning, it landed in front of the bedroom door and pecked at the Magical Hair Gu, hoisting it up. It raised its neck and swallowed the Magical Hair Gu.</p>
<p>The Magical Hair Gu twisted in the chick’s stomach, but a golden flame burned in its stomach, gradually melting the Magical Hair Gu.</p>
<p>Pfft!</p>
<p>On the grass outside, Worm Dugu suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood. He returned to his original form, dispelling his mosquito-like form. His face was terrifyingly pale and filled with disbelief.</p>
<p>Impossible… The Magical Hair Gu is almost invulnerable… It grows once it enters the flesh… How can this be… Worm Dugu’s face was pale as he broke out into a cold sweat.</p>
<p>He had been raising worms for so many years, but this was the first time he had encountered such a terrifying opponent—one who could even easily kill a Magical Hair Gu.</p>
<p>Could this Zhou Wen really be my nemesis? He can even easily kill a Magical Hair Gu. It’s probably easy for him to take my life… If I had known this would happen… I shouldn’t have come… The more Worm Dugu thought about it, the more terrified he became. He gritted his teeth and got up from the ground to knock on Zhou Wen’s door.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was grinding dungeons when he heard the doorbell ring. He thought it was a classmate, but when he opened the door, he saw an old man standing at the door. It was none other than Worm Dugu.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was secretly wary. Could it be as An Sheng said? Worm Dugu is here to settle scores?</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was thinking about how to deal with Worm Dugu, the latter suddenly bowed at him. “Young Master Wen, it’s all my fault. I was blind. I shouldn’t have offended you. According to the rules of our Dugu family, I’ve lost this match. Feel free to punish me, even if it takes my life. I’ll do whatever you want.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was puzzled when he heard that. He had indeed been wary of Worm Dugu, but he didn’t discover anything entering his room. What was this Worm Dugu talking about?</p>
<h3 id='chapter716'>Chapter 716: Master</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Do you know how you lost?” Zhou Wen asked Worm Dugu.</p>
<p>He had no idea what had happened, so he wanted to figure it out.</p>
<p>Worm Dugu ended up misunderstanding Zhou Wen. He said bitterly, “Young Master Wen, you are indeed brilliant. I used the Blood-Sucking Spider, Black Blood Gu, and seven other types of miniature Companion Beasts. Each one was smaller than the last, but none of them escaped your notice. All the Companion Beasts were killed by you. In the end, I had no choice but to use the Magical Hair Gu. I originally thought I could use the Magical Hair Gu to teach you a lesson, but I never expected that I would be the one being taught a lesson.”</p>
<p>“Why did you attack me?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>Worm Dugu blushed and stammered, “When I saw your technique at the hospital, I felt that you were more suited to learning my techniques of raising insects and worms, so I wanted to take you to the South District to learn how to raise insects and worms from me.”</p>
<p>“You mean that you want to take me in as your disciple?” Zhou Wen asked Worm Dugu in a daze.</p>
<p>Worm Dugu’s face flushed red. “Young Master Wen, I’m really sorry. I’ve really embarrassed myself. Only today did I realize that there’s always someone better out there. What a joke about you being my disciple; I’m not even qualified to be your disciple. If you wish to kill me, just give the word. I won’t dirty your hands.”</p>
<p>“Did the dimensional creature in Governor Qin’s brain have anything to do with you?” Zhou Wen asked directly.</p>
<p>Worm Dugu immediately said with a serious expression, “Definitely not. Although our Dugu family does need a batch of Essence Gold, we wouldn’t go to such an extent, much less harm Deputy Governor Qin who defends against a dimensional zone.”</p>
<p>“In that case, leave,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>However, Worm Dugu had no intention of leaving. He gritted his teeth and said to Zhou Wen, “Young Master Wen, I’ve raised worms my entire life. This is the first time I’ve suffered such a terrible defeat. I don’t even know how I failed. Can you tell me how you killed the Magical Hair Gu?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Zhou Wen said casually. He really didn’t know how the Magical Hair Gu died. He didn’t even see it.</p>
<p>On second thought, the chick had been flying around without him knowing why. He could roughly guess that the chick had resolved the miniature Companion Beasts and the Magical Hair Gu. However, it wasn’t appropriate for him to tell Worm Dugu.</p>
<p>“You don’t know how the Magical Hair Gu died?” Worm Dugu naturally didn’t believe such an answer.</p>
<p>“It was dead before I even saw it. How would I know how it died?” As Zhou Wen spoke, he prepared to close the door. He wasn’t in the mood to say anything more to Worm Dugu.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for the fact that he didn’t wish for Worm Dugu to die in school thus causing a conflict between the Dugu family and Luoyang, he would have taken action.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t plan on taking action now, Zhou Wen had no intention of letting Worm Dugu off the hook. He planned on using the Invisibility Cloak to tail Worm Dugu and see if he had any accomplices before deciding what to do.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was only making a passing remark, hoping to send Worm Dugu on his way. It also gave him an opportunity to test the effects of the Invisibility Cloak.</p>
<p>However, when Worm Dugu heard that, he was alarmed. “You killed the Magical Hair Gu without seeing it?”</p>
<p>“Yes. If there’s nothing else, leave. Don’t disturb me again,” Zhou Wen said as he closed the door.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Worm Dugu rushed over and held the door open. “Young Master Wen, can you let me see your Companion Beast. A Companion Beast that can easily kill a Magical Hair Gu must be extraordinary…”</p>
<p>Just as he was about to say something, Worm Dugu suddenly saw the chick standing on the table. He immediately widened his eyes in shock.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with you? Do you really think I don’t dare kill you?” Zhou Wen said with a cold expression. If Worm Dugu continued pestering him, he would have no choice but to attack.</p>
<p>“That… That can’t be…” Worm Dugu didn’t seem to hear Zhou Wen’s reprimand as he stared intently at the chick and stammered,” Could that be the legendary phoenix fledging?”</p>
<p>“You recognize it?” Zhou Wen looked at Worm Dugu in surprise.</p>
<p>The chick had been with him for quite some time, but not many people recognized its origins. Now, the chick looked like a tiny golden eagle. It didn’t look anything like a phoenix.</p>
<p>“I recognize it, of course I recognize it. How can a person who plays with worms and insects not recognize a phoenix? A phoenix is the nemesis of insects and worms. No matter how powerful a Gu worm is, they are powerless against it… No wonder… No wonder…” As Worm Dugu spoke, he tore off its clothes, revealing his dry chest muscles.</p>
<p>“What are you trying to do?” Zhou Wen took two steps back and looked at Worm Dugu in surprise.</p>
<p>However, Worm Dugu turned around, allowing Zhou Wen to see his back. On his back was a huge blood-colored phoenix tattoo. It looked extremely realistic as though it could flap its wings and fly out at any moment.</p>
<p>“You have a phoenix Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>Worm Dugu said in embarrassment, “How can I have a phoenix Companion Beast? The teacher who taught me how to raise worms tattooed this on me. It’s called the Phoenix-Hooking Evil Painting. This is a rule passed down from my ancestors. It uses a mixture of special avian blood and medicinal herbs for the tattooing. It can be used to ward off insects and evil. It’s to prevent me from being injured when catching insects and raising Gu. In my lineage, there are also ancient books regarding phoenixes. The phoenix fledging described in them is very similar to yours. It’s just slightly different… Young Master Wen… Is this really a phoenix fledgling?”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“I see.” Zhou Wen didn’t answer as he nodded and said, “If there’s nothing else, go back. I won’t let you off so easily the next time I see you.”</p>
<p>However, Worm Dugu didn’t move. He said to Zhou Wen in a fawning manner, “Young Master Wen, do you lack any errand boys? Do you want me to be your assistant?”</p>
<p>“I don’t need an assistant,” Zhou Wen said with a frown.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Men usually find young ladies to be their assistants… Then, what do you think about you becoming my master?” Worm Dugu’s eyes darted around as he suddenly said something unexpected.</p>
<p>“How old are you? Why are you still taking me as your master? I…” Before Zhou Wen could finish his sentence, Worm Dugu had already plopped to the ground.</p>
<p>“Master, please accept a bow from your disciple, Worm Dugu…” Worm Dugu didn’t hesitate at all. He was about to pay his respects to his master by kowtowing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was dumbfounded. He had no idea what was happening. Before he could react, Worm Dugu had already finished kowtowing.</p>
<p>“What are you trying to do?” Zhou Wen stared at Worm Dugu and frowned.</p>
<p>Worm Dugu crawled up and said, “From now on, you are my master. Master, when are you going to teach me how to raise a phoenix?”</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter717'>Chapter 717: Worm Dugu’s Plan</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen took out his saber and prepared to slash at him. After all this back and forth, Worm Dugu was actually targeting the chick.</p>
<p>Worm Dugu hurriedly retreated out of the yard when he saw Zhou Wen take out his saber. As he retreated, he shouted, “Master, I’ll visit you another day. Call me if there’s anything you need. I’ll be there anytime.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen closed the door and immediately summoned the Invisibility Cloak. Then, he jumped out of the window at the back of his residence and tailed Worm Dugu from afar to see what he was up to.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw Worm Dugu secretly arrive at an uninhabited spot before turning into a mosquito. He then flew out of the school.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wore the Invisibility Cloak and had Truth Listener on his ear. He kept monitoring the movements of Worm Dugu and soon followed him to a dilapidated warehouse.</p>
<p>There’s indeed an accomplice. Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to listen and realized that there was another person in the warehouse besides Worm Dugu.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen listened attentively, hoping to gather some useful information.</p>
<p>With Truth Listener around, he didn’t need to risk entering the warehouse.</p>
<p>“Second Grandpa, what took you so long? How did the matter regarding Essence Gold go?” The person who spoke to Worm Dugu was a girl. She appeared rather young. She had a round face and huge eyes. She looked to be about sixteen or seventeen years old at most.</p>
<p>“I screwed up. The Blood Thread Brain-Eating Gu in Qin Wufu’s body was extracted by someone else,” said Worm Dugu.</p>
<p>“Apart from our Dugu family, there’s actually someone who can extract a Blood Thread Brain-Eating Gu that has entrenched a brain?” the girl said in disbelief.</p>
<p>“I didn’t believe it either, but it was indeed extracted. Furthermore, Qin Wufu was completely unharmed,” said Worm Dugu helplessly.</p>
<p>“What about the Essence Gold? Is the An family willing to sell so much refined Essence Gold to us?” the girl asked worriedly.</p>
<p>“Probably not.” Dugu Gu smiled and said, “But don’t worry. Even if we don’t use Essence Gold, I’ve already thought of a way to capture the Myriad Poison Gu King.”</p>
<p>“Second Grandpa, didn’t you try that the last time? Even the Magical Hair Gu is helpless against the Myriad Poison Gu King. It was almost destroyed. Do you have any more powerful Gu?” The girl looked at Worm Dugu in disbelief.</p>
<p>Dugu Gu chuckled and said, “I don’t have one, but I’ve just become a disciple to a master. If I can get his help, I’ll definitely be able to capture that Myriad Poison Gu King.”</p>
<p>“Second Grandpa, didn’t you say that the master you had is already dead? Where did this master come from?” The girl’s face looked puzzled.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I just say that I just became a disciple of this master? He has a phoenix fledging. With the help of the phoenix fledgling, we don’t need to forge an Essence Gold Worm Nurturing Furnace to still capture the Myriad Poison Gu King,” said Worm Dugu.</p>
<p>“Then, Second Grandpa, quickly get your new master to help,” the girl said.</p>
<p>“Cough, cough. There’s no rush.” Worm Dugu knew very well that it wasn’t that easy to get Zhou Wen to use the phoenix fledgling to help him capture the Myriad Poison Gu King.</p>
<p>The girl sighed and said, “I originally thought that our luck was good and we happened to encounter the situation of Qin Wufu having his brain invaded by a Blood Thread Brain-Eating Gu. I thought we could exchange for enough Essence Gold, but I never expected that we wouldn’t even get a single bit of Essence Gold. I wonder when we will be able to capture the Myriad Poison King.”</p>
<p>“Mi’er, don’t worry. With Second Grandpa around, I guarantee that I’ll help you obtain the Gu King of Myriad Poison Valley. Furthermore, other than me, no one else has the ability to take the Gu King away. Just relax.” Worm Dugu changed the topic and said, “Stay in Luoyang and have some fun for a few days. When we are to return to the South District, I’ll naturally seek you out. Don’t run around. You can’t leave Luoyang City, understand?”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Got it, Second Grandpa.” Mi’er agreed seriously.</p>
<p>After some thought, Mi’er asked again, “Second Grandpa, should I visit your master? Second Grandpa, how should I address your master?”</p>
<p>“No need, no need. You don’t have to worry about this matter.” After Worm Dugu sent Mi’er away, he muttered to himself, “I don’t know if there’s a second phoenix fledgling. I reckon the possibility of there being a second one is very low. Even if there is one, I’m afraid it won’t be easy to obtain it. I should think of a way to invite Master to follow me to Myriad Poison Valley, but how can I move him? From the looks of it, I have to think of a way.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen listened outside all this time. He heard them talking about Gu, but he didn’t hear any plans. From Mi’er’s tone, Qin Wufu’s injuries didn’t seem to have anything to do with them.</p>
<p>Although I don’t know if the chick is a real phoenix, it does seem to be able to restrain dimensional creatures like Gu worms. In the future, I have to bring it along if I have to go to the South District, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>After Worm Dugu left the dilapidated warehouse, he returned to the hotel and didn’t come out again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen eavesdropped for a long time, but he didn’t gather any useful information. Finally, he gave up on monitoring Worm Dugu and returned to the school dorm.</p>
<p>The ability of the Invisibility Cloak is really useful. Even if I walk on the streets during the day, I don’t need to worry about being seen by others. Even if I don’t use the Wheel of Destiny, it’s enough to remain invisible under normal circumstances. Zhou Wen thought about how he could use the Invisibility Cloak to do something big.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Before the dimensional zones are fully unlocked, I should download some game dungeons. I’ll download the famous dimensional zones first. I wonder what dimensional zones Primordial Immortal Sword, Origin Realm King, and Death of the Underworld Companion Beasts come from. After some thought, Zhou Wen decided to start with the nearest dimensional zones.</p>
<p>The famous dimensional zones closer to Luoyang should be the Xia family’s dimensional zones, right? Zhou Wen looked up the information and quickly made up his mind. He planned on heading to the Xia family’s territory.</p>
<p>The Xia family controlled many mysterious dimensional zones. Zhou Wen had always wanted to go to a few of them.</p>
<p>One of the most famous dimensional zones was named Ancient Sword Tomb. It was said that there were many legendary swords there. The Xia family’s old hero had once obtained a Mythical sword-type Companion Egg from Ancient Sword Tomb and used it to reign supreme.</p>
<p>However, that was decades ago. The Xia family had controlled the Ancient Sword Tomb for so long, so they definitely had more than one Mythical Companion Beast sword.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suspected that the demonic sword that Demonic Neonate snatched from Xia Xuanyue was from the Ancient Sword Tomb.</p>
<p>After I’m done with the Xia family, I’ll tour the six families’ territories and download the dimensional zones they control. When that happens, I can grind for any Companion Beast I want. There’s no need for me to risk my life. Zhou Wen did as he said. He planned on informing An Sheng before setting off for the Xia family.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen didn’t dare leave the chick and antelope behind. He was mainly afraid that the Dugu family would target the chick. Although the possibility of the antelope being stolen was very low, Zhou Wen still planned on taking them with him to prevent any accidents.</p>
<h3 id='chapter718'>Chapter 718: Teacher Square</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The chick stood on Zhou Wen’s shoulder and looked around curiously.</p>
<p>However, the antelope looked listless; it didn’t seem to like walking.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush. This trip was also a form of training. He planned on taking a look at all the dimensional zones along the way. He planned on taking a picture of all the dimensional zones with the tiny palm symbol to prepare for a full-scale break-out of dimensional zones in the future.</p>
<p>Ancient Sword Tomb was in Imperial Capital. Zhou Wen could also take this chance to visit Wang Lu and repay his debt.</p>
<p>Imperial Capital was also known as Capital. Unlike the Holy City that was jointly controlled by the six families, Imperial Capital was basically controlled by the Xia family. However, to everyone’s surprise, the Special Inspector Bureau’s headquarters was also in Imperial Capital, not Holy City.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had plans of making a trip to the bureau’s headquarters on his visit to the Imperial Capital.</p>
<p>As many roads were blocked by dimensional zones, all he could do was circle around them. He had to travel further. Even with Zhou Wen’s present strength, he didn’t dare barge into unexplored dimensional zones to prevent any accidents.</p>
<p>The route Zhou Wen chose was the one An Sheng had planned for him. Although it was a little further, it was safe and reliable.</p>
<p>After carefully studying the information, the first relatively famous dimensional zone he encountered was called Five Dragons Mouth.</p>
<p>It was originally a scenic spot. After the dimensional storms, the Five Dragons Mouth turned into a complicated, stacked dimensional zone that had multiple dimensional zones within.</p>
<p>One of the most famous dimensional zones of the Five Dragons Mouth was called Mount Confucius. There was a Teacher Square in the western Mount Confucius, and Mount Laojun was in the east. Legend had it that the Confucian and Daoist families had competed here, leaving behind many moving tales.</p>
<p>After the dimensional storms, Mount Confucius became even stranger. One could often hear the sound of reading from Teacher Square, but when one really looked over, there wasn’t a single soul.</p>
<p>There was also Arrow Atop. It was the highest peak of Five Dragons Mouth. It had many legends related to Hou Yi.</p>
<p>There were also other dimensional zones that had their own specialties. Zhou Wen planned on heading to the Five Dragons Mouth to take a look. If he could download the dimensional zones, it wouldn’t be bad to keep them for future research.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Worm Dugu didn’t know that Zhou Wen had left Luoyang, so he went to look for him early in the morning.</p>
<p>“Master, are you awake? I’m here to pay my respects to you. When are you free? Teach me, your disciple, how to raise a phoenix.” In order to learn the way to raise a phoenix, Worm Dugu didn’t care about his reputation at all. He kept using the words, “master” and “disciple,” without any hesitation.</p>
<p>“Why are you making such a din so early in the morning?” Li Xuan walked out of Zhou Wen’s dorm.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen left, he got Li Xuan to take all the food in the fridge to prevent it from spoiling.</p>
<p>“Who are you? Where’s my master?” Worm Dugu glared at Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“How would I know who your master is?” Li Xuan sized up Worm Dugu and saw that the old man was already in his seventies or eighties. To think he still had a master.</p>
<p>“You walked out of my master’s dorm, and you still say that you don’t know who my master is?” said Worm Dugu.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen is your master?” Li Xuan widened his mouth as he sized up Worm Dugu in disbelief.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was only seventeen or eighteen years old. How could he have such an old disciple?</p>
<p>“That’s right. Zhou Wen is my master. Has he woken up?” Worm Dugu said matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>“If Zhou Wen is your master, then wouldn’t I, Zhou Wen’s classmate, be your martial uncle? Disciple-Nephew, there’s no need to continue shouting. Zhou Wen has gone out and isn’t on campus,” Li Xuan joked.</p>
<p>Worm Dugu narrowed his eyes. He recognized Zhou Wen as his master because he wanted to learn how to rear a phoenix from Zhou Wen. It didn’t mean that others could use him as a joke.</p>
<p>“Sure. That depends on whether you have the fortune to be my martial uncle.” Worm Dugu remained unperturbed as he secretly released a Black Blood Gu, hoping to teach Li Xuan a lesson.</p>
<p>However, when the Black Blood Gu crawled to Li Xuan’s side, it suddenly stopped moving. It sprawled on the ground and trembled. No matter how the Worm Dugu urged it, the Black Blood Gu didn’t dare approach Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Eh?” Worm Dugu was slightly taken aback. He had never encountered such a situation.</p>
<p>He summoned a few more Gu, but the moment they approached Li Xuan, they immediately curled up in horror, not daring to touch him.</p>
<p>Worm Dugu wore a look of surprise. What’s going on? Why are my Gu worms afraid of him? Does he have a phoenix too?</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued forward and didn’t encounter any danger. Along the way, he saw a Companion Beast caravan that transported goods.</p>
<p>As motor transportation became increasingly difficult, many transportation companies had chosen to use Companion Beasts to transport goods.</p>
<p>He successfully arrived at Five Dragons Mouth. Zhou Wen walked along the mountain path, hoping to find the tiny palm symbol. After searching for a long time, he didn’t find it.</p>
<p>Instead, he saw many people fighting a monkey-type dimensional creature. The monkey was muscular and had a short tail. It looked rather ferocious.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a look at the information and knew that this dimensional creature was called a macaque. It was a relatively common dimensional creature at Five Dragons Mouth. There were many of them, and they were typically at the Mortal stage. Occasionally, one could see a Legendary Monkey King. Legend had it that the macaque here had the bloodline of the Handsome Monkey King. He didn’t know if it was true.</p>
<p>The Macaque King’s combat strength was considered quite powerful among Legendaries. Furthermore, the Macaque King Companion Beast’s companion form was very special, giving it a rather high value. The nearby Legendaries would often come here to hunt the Macaque King, hoping to gain something.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in hunting the Macaque King. He just searched for the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen heard a strange sound coming from a nearby mountain. It sounded like children reading textbooks. The sound was drawn out, making it sound odd.</p>
<p>However, those voices were clearly not children’s voices. They were the voices of adults.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the source of the sound and then at the map. He immediately knew that it was the legendary Teacher Square.</p>
<p>The legends are true. There’s actually the sound of reading in broad daylight at Teacher Square. Zhou Wen’s interest was piqued as he walked towards Teacher Square to see what was so magical about it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be taken aback when he reached Teacher Square and saw the scene in front of him.</p>
<p>There were many people sitting on Teacher Square. They were all twirling their heads as they read. The voice Zhou Wen had heard wasn’t a phenomenon, but a result of actual people reading.</p>
<p>These people were engrossed in their reading. They twirled their heads and read loudly, as though they were primary school students who were seriously reciting their textbooks. They also resembled scholars from ancient times. Their voices were especially charming as they dragged out their last words.</p>
<p>Could this be a reading activity that’s hosted here? Zhou Wen thought as he climbed onto Teacher Square.</p>
<p>However, just as he stepped onto Teacher Square, he couldn’t help but open his mouth and emit the same voices as the others. He began reading with them, but he had never heard the content that he was reading.</p>
<p>There’s something odd about this place! Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter719'>Chapter 719: Injured</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but sit down and become one of them. He began reciting with them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen recited in a rhythmic manner as though he was very familiar with it, but he had no idea what he was reciting.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the mysterious power of Teacher Square wasn’t harmful. All he did was sit there and read. There was no further development. Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to escape the mysterious power’s control. He wanted to figure out what the mysterious power was up to.</p>
<p>There were more than a hundred people sitting on the huge Teacher Square. They looked like people who cultivated. Zhou Wen felt that it wasn’t a coincidence that they were here.</p>
<p>Why isn’t there any mention of such a strange power on Mount Confucius? Zhou Wen recited whilst studying the content he was reciting.</p>
<p>The content was very esoteric. The language and words were very different from what modern people were used to. It was clearly an ancient article.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s level of literacy was very ordinary. He could still understand some simple ancient texts, but he really couldn’t understand such obscure ancient texts.</p>
<p>Previously, Zhou Wen had studied the ancient texts of Daoism and Buddhism, but this ancient text was clearly different from the two. He had never heard of many terms, so he couldn’t figure out what it meant, even after listening for a while.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to memorize the article he was reciting and slowly study it later, but he soon realized that no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t remember a single word.</p>
<p>After reciting a sentence, it was as if it had vanished from his memory. He couldn’t memorize it at all.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I can only try recording it. Zhou Wen wanted to take out his phone to record his voice.</p>
<p>However, he realized that his body wasn’t listening to him. All he could do was sit there and chant. He couldn’t do anything else.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen switched his Essence Energy Art to the Dao Sutra. He wanted to use the power of Gods Retreat to break the rules of Teacher Square and take out his phone to record the recital.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen switched to the Dao Sutra, he suddenly felt a terrifying force strike him like lightning. The jade infant nearly cracked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body tumbled down Teacher Square like a balloon. Thankfully, after leaving Teacher Square, Zhou Wen regained control of his body and quickly found his footing.</p>
<p>He spat out a mouthful of blood as his organs were severely injured. Some of his bones had even fractured. Zhou Wen was alarmed. Is the taboo power of Teacher Square that domineering?</p>
<p>However, on second thought, he felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>The taboo power in Netherworld City was already extremely terrifying, but it wasn’t as potent as this. The taboo power in Teacher Square was no longer something that could be explained by the word “potent.” Zhou Wen felt that the taboo power of Teacher Square was targeting him.</p>
<p>Wait, I think I understand. Zhou Wen immediately recalled.</p>
<p>Legend had it that Mount Confucius was the place where the Confucian and Daoist practitioners fought for supremacy, and Teacher Square was the territory of Confucianism. It was highly likely that he had been targeted when he used the Dao Sutra on Teacher Square.</p>
<p>In that case, I should head to Mount Laojun to take a look. That’s Daoist territory. Zhou Wen wanted to stand up, but his injuries were too severe. The moment he moved, he grimaced in pain.</p>
<p>I should heal my injuries first. Zhou Wen switched to the Inverse Ancient Sovereign Life Soul and used its powerful lifeforce to heal his injured organs and bones.</p>
<p>However, the Inverse Ancient Sovereign only had a powerful lifeforce. Its self-healing speed was far inferior to Li Xuan’s Life Soul.</p>
<p>The antelope looked at Zhou Wen gloatingly, as though it already knew the mystery of Teacher Square.</p>
<p>The chick skipped about on the rocks beside him. It was filled with curiosity about everything.</p>
<p>“Are you alright?” A woman in her thirties walked over and squatted down to ask Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I’m fine. It’s just a small injury.” Zhou Wen shook his head.</p>
<p>The woman smiled and said, “You aren’t from around here. It’s your first time at Mount Confucius’s Teacher Square, right?”</p>
<p>“How did you know?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“The locals know that you can’t use Daoist Essence Energy Arts on Teacher Square. You must have used the Daoist Essence Energy Art just now to be struck out,” the woman explained.</p>
<p>The recital had ended, and the people sitting on Teacher Square had returned to normal. They were walking down in twos and threes.</p>
<p>They looked at Zhou Wen with a smile. Clearly, they, like the woman, knew why Zhou Wen had been expelled.</p>
<p>“Teacher Square is a holy land for cultivating Confucian Essence Energy Arts like Righteousness. If you cultivate in Daoist Essence Energy Arts, you should head to Mount Laojun.”</p>
<p>The woman thought for a moment and reminded him, “Teacher Square has an hour of recital daily. If you want to tour the area, you can go up after that hour.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your advice. I wonder if Mount Laojun has any taboos?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“Not really. There’s a Dao book on the top of Mount Laojun, but it requires self-enlightenment. There’s no force that can force you.” The woman sized up Zhou Wen and said, “Your injuries don’t seem light. Do you want me to take you to the hospital?”</p>
<p>“There’s no need. I’ll be fine after resting for a while.” Zhou Wen hurriedly thanked the woman for her kindness.</p>
<p>After the woman left, Zhou Wen sat there to recuperate. However, his injuries were too serious. On the second day, the woman and many people who cultivated in Confucian Essence Energy Art came to Teacher Square again. Yet, Zhou Wen hadn’t completely recovered from his injuries.</p>
<p>“Why are you still here? Are you really fine?” the woman asked Zhou Wen in surprise.</p>
<p>Typically, even if someone was expelled, they wouldn’t be too heavily injured.</p>
<p>“It’s fine, it’s fine. I just like the scenery here. I want to take a break here,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>The average person’s injuries wouldn’t be that serious, but not only did Zhou Wen use the Dao Sutra, but he had also used Gods Retreat, hoping to nullify the taboo power of Teacher Square. That was why he was so heavily injured.</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhou Wen’s expression was much better than yesterday, the woman didn’t say anything else. Like the others, she got onto Teacher Square and sat down. Soon, Zhou Wen heard the familiar recital.</p>
<p>Those people basically came to Teacher Square to read every day. Zhou Wen chatted with the woman a few times and knew that everyone called her Sister Gui.</p>
<p>According to Sister Gui, reading on Teacher Square accelerated one’s cultivation efficiency of Confucian Essence Energy Arts. However, there were very few people cultivating the Confucian Essence Energy Arts now. Therefore, the people who came to Teacher Square for the daily recital were basically acquaintances. They had known each other long ago.</p>
<p>After a few days, Zhou Wen finally recovered from his injuries. However, his injuries were secondary. The primary reason was that it took until now for the jade infant to recover from its injuries.</p>
<p>After recovering, the jade infant gave Zhou Wen a strange feeling as though it was about to break through.</p>
<p>Could it be that being injured helps the jade infant break through? Zhou Wen had a thought.</p>
<h3 id='chapter720'>Chapter 720: Comfort Only When Thrown Out</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen decided to give it another try. Gods Retreat had already reached its peak. It couldn’t continue improving even in Netherworld City.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>If the power of Teacher Square could really allow Gods Retreat to advance to a Perfect Body, it would be Zhou Wen’s first Perfect Body Life Soul.</p>
<p>When it was the recital session at Teacher Square, Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and walked towards it.</p>
<p>When Sister Gui saw that Zhou Wen had mostly recovered from his injuries, she said with a smile, “This time, make sure not to circulate a Daoist Essence Energy Art when you step into Teacher Square.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>The others laughed. After recuperating here for a few days, they had basically recognized Zhou Wen and knew about his embarrassing use of a Daoist Essence Energy Art on Teacher Square.</p>
<p>Just as she was about to say something, the recital session began.</p>
<p>A mysterious force enveloped Teacher Square. Everyone suddenly sat down and began to recite an article in all seriousness—one that they didn’t understand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was one of them, but just as he started reciting, he switched his Essence Energy Art to Dao Sutra.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>As though he was struck in the soul, Zhou Wen felt his soul tremble as his body involuntarily flew out. He slammed onto the stone steps and rolled a distance before he managed to control his body.</p>
<p>His injuries were worse than before, but Zhou Wen was pleased to discover that the jade infant’s injuries were much lighter than the previous time. After the previous injury, his resistance seemed to have improved significantly.</p>
<p>Could it be that this method really works? Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>An hour later, Sister Gui and company came down from Teacher Square and passed by Zhou Wen, who was recuperating. Sister Gui said in a speechless manner, “Little Zhou, didn’t I tell you that you can’t use Daoist Essence Energy Arts on Teacher Square? Why didn’t you listen to me? I won’t harm you.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly said, “Sister Gui, I know that I can’t use Daoist Essence Energy Arts on Teacher Square, but I have a bad temper. The more I’m not allowed to do it, the more I have to do it.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Child…” Sister Gui was instantly rendered speechless.</p>
<p>“Sister Gui, don’t bother about him. There’s something wrong with this kid’s brain.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Who cares what he’s doing? He’s just looking for trouble. I think it’s because life in the Federation is too good that there are so many young people out there looking for trouble.”</p>
<p>“Young people have never endured suffering. It’s understandable why they want to seek out excitement. I was the same when I was young. My mom said that girls will have children when they sleep with men. I didn’t listen to her, and I ended up giving birth…”</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>From then on, there was an additional young man with an antelope and chick on Mount Confucius’s Teacher Square. In the beginning, he was sent flying every two to three days.</p>
<p>Later on, it became worse. He was sent flying daily during the recital session on Teacher Square because of his circulation of a Daoist Essence Energy Art as though he would feel uncomfortable if he didn’t get thrown out.</p>
<p>Sister Gui tried persuading him at first, but Zhou Wen didn’t listen. She got used to it over time.</p>
<p>After the recital, a young girl left with Sister Gui. When they passed by Zhou Wen who was lying by the roadside, the girl looked at him and said to her, “Sister Gui, do you think that Little Zhou is silly? Why does he have to go against Teacher Square for no reason? Isn’t he just looking for trouble? He really has nothing better to do.”</p>
<p>Sister Gui smiled and said, “How is Little Zhou silly? He’s such a good lad. I think he has his reasons for doing so.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“What reason could there be? I think he’s just bored.” The young girl paused before continuing, “Why is there such a senseless person? If everyone was like Xu Tong, the Federation’s land wouldn’t be constantly devoured by dimensional zones.”</p>
<p>As she spoke, the young girl couldn’t help but look at the youth in front of her.</p>
<p>The young man had an imposing appearance. He had sword-like eyebrows and bright eyes. He was indeed a very handsome young man.</p>
<p>Xu Tong was very famous at Five Dragons Mouth. He cultivated Righteous Energy and had advanced to the Epic stage at the age of twenty-seven. In this region, no one was better than Xu Tong.</p>
<p>It was understandable that Xu Tong could win the girl’s admiration.</p>
<p>Sister Gui said with a smile, “Xu Tong is not bad, but there are many outstanding girls around outstanding men. Why don’t you consider Little Zhou? I think that young lad is pretty good. He looks quite handsome and is about the same age as you. No one is vying with you for him yet.”</p>
<p>“Tch, I don’t fancy such a senseless man. If I want to find a boyfriend, I have to find an outstanding man like Xu Tong.” The girl curled her lips and turned her head to look at Zhou Wen who was lying on the mountain path. No matter how she looked at him, he was far inferior to the dignified and refined Xu Tong.</p>
<p>Sister Gui said with a faint smile, “It’s understandable that little girls like men like Xu Tong. When you reach my age, you might feel that some special men might be more interesting.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps. However, I won’t find such a man interesting at any time.” The girl didn’t find Zhou Wen interesting when she saw him sleeping on the mountain path. His clothes were disheveled and there was a chick skipping around him. He resembled a wandering performer.</p>
<p>Days passed. Every time the jade infant was struck, Zhou Wen would have the illusion that he was about to break through. Although this feeling was very real, no matter how realistic it was, it was still an illusion. He couldn’t advance to a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>Strange. I clearly feel that I can advance to a Perfect Body, so why haven’t I advanced? What’s the difference? Zhou Wen kept pondering over this question.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen thought of a possibility.</p>
<p>Back then, Zero Taboo was a crystalline body. After the crystal exploded, the Gods Retreat jade infant was born.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was wondering if it was possible that the jade infant needed to be destroyed before it could advance to a Perfect Body. This explained the reason why he felt that he was about to break through every time the jade infant was injured.</p>
<p>However, as the jade infant’s body healed, the feeling of a breakthrough vanished.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that there was only one possibility. However, it was too risky to shatter the jade infant. If his guess was wrong and the jade infant was really destroyed, he would be doomed. He would have to condense the Life Soul again.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen was still hesitant about giving the jade infant a try.</p>
<p>It was time for the recital session again. When Sister Gui and company arrived at Teacher Square, many people greeted Zhou Wen. As Zhou Wen had been here for more than two weeks, the people who often came to Teacher Square were already familiar with him.</p>
<p>However, most people felt that Zhou Wen was a little silly and only wanted to joke with him. They didn’t have any ill intentions.</p>
<p>Sister Gui got Zhou Wen to head to Teacher Square with her as she asked, “Little Zhou, are you still circulating the Daoist Essence Energy Art today?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>Everyone waited on Teacher Square for the recital session to begin. Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to chat, so Sister Gui and the girl beside her chatted.</p>
<h3 id='chapter721'>Chapter 721: Reconstitution after Collapsing</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>When it was time for the recital, everyone involuntarily sat down and began reciting.</p>
<p>Although everyone was conscious, they couldn’t control their bodies or mouths. They could only move freely after the recital session ended.</p>
<p>During this period of time, they could do nothing but recite.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was considering if he should use the power of Teacher Square to shatter the jade infant and reconstitute it when he suddenly saw a figure rushing across the mountain path at an astonishing speed.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, it was actually a macaque. However, this macaque seemed to be a little different from ordinary macaque. The average macaque was only about 1.5 meters tall. Even a Legendary Macaque King maxed out at 1.9 meters. That would make it look majestic.</p>
<p>However, this macaque was nearly three meters tall. It looked even more ferocious than a macaque. Its eyes were glowing red, and its fur appeared metallic black. It looked like a ferocious wrath from afar.</p>
<p>Sister Gui and the others also noticed the blood-eyed black macaque. They were somewhat surprised, but no one was worried.</p>
<p>Even if this blood-eyed black macaque was an Epic dimensional creature, as long as it entered Teacher Square, it would be affected by Teacher Square’s power. Like all humans, it would sit on the ground and recite ancient texts.</p>
<p>Something similar had happened in the past. A macaque that accidentally entered Teacher Square ended up sitting down and reading like the humans. It wouldn’t threaten the scholars here.</p>
<p>However, the moment the blood-eyed black macaque entered Teacher Square, everyone’s expression changed drastically, revealing shock.</p>
<p>The blood-eyed black macaque actually didn’t sit down to recite. Its eyes were glowing with blood-red light as it walked step by step towards the humans sitting on Teacher Square. It exposed its fangs and looked like it was going to devour someone.</p>
<p>The color drained from everyone’s faces, but they couldn’t move. All they could do was watch as the blood-eyed black macaque walked over as they recited.</p>
<p>Everyone wore odd expressions. Their faces looked prim and proper as they swirled their heads while reciting. However, their eyes and voices were filled with fear. There was even the sound of sobbing in their voices.</p>
<p>If they could move now, they would have run as far away as they could.</p>
<p>It was especially so for the three people who were closest to the blood-eyed black macaque. Their expressions were as if they had been tied up and fed feces. It was as uncomfortable as it could be.</p>
<p>The blood-eyed black macaque walked over step by step. From its heavy footsteps, Zhou Wen knew that it was still affected by the power of Teacher Square. However, it didn’t suffer as significant an effect as them.</p>
<p>Just as the blood-eyed black macaque was about to reach the crowd, a man suddenly stood up and shouted at the macaque, “How can we allow you to taint the Holy Land of Teacher Square? Leave!”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He never expected someone to be able to stand up while reciting. On careful look, he saw that it was Xu Tong.</p>
<p>At that moment, Xu Tong’s entire body was emitting a kind of aura. That aura was formless and intangible. It wasn’t as resplendent as divine light, nor was it as grand as Buddhistic light. It was an indescribable aura.</p>
<p>Everyone was overjoyed. They had thought that they were doomed for sure, but they didn’t expect Xu Tong to stand up to resist the blood-eyed black macaque. They felt that there was hope.</p>
<p>Xu Tong was already an Epic expert, so he should be able to kill the blood-eyed black macaque. After all, no high-level dimensional creature had ever appeared near Mount Confucius.</p>
<p>The blood-eyed black macaque didn’t retreat because of Xu Tong’s berating and imposing manner. Instead, it became even more ferocious. A bloody light flashed in its eyes as its majestic body broke through the sound barrier. With a sonic boom, it threw a violent punch at Xu Tong.</p>
<p>“Pervading Heaven and Earth is the aura of righteousness. A righteous heart empowers…” Xu Tong’s words seemed to be augmented by a magical power. As he spoke, the righteous aura in his body became even stronger. It was as if his entire being was enveloped by the righteousness that pervaded the world.</p>
<p>At the instant the blood-eyed black macaque rushed in front of him, Xu Tong’s palm also struck it with a terrifying force that was akin to the sea or dragon.</p>
<p>What a powerful Essence Energy Skill… Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. The power of Xu Tong’s palm strike was extremely powerful at the Epic stage.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Xu Tong’s palm collided with the blood-eyed black macaque’s claw, producing a terrifying shockwave that sent the people beside him staggering. Meanwhile, Xu Tong flew out like a runaway kite and slammed into the mountain rocks, causing him to vomit blood. After struggling a few times, he got up and sat there. As he vomited blood, he chanted ancient texts.</p>
<p>Everyone felt a chill in their hearts. In their eyes, Xu Tong was already an invincible existence since he was able to forcefully resist the power of Teacher Square. However, such a powerful Xu Tong was severely injured by the blood-eyed black macaque’s attack. He even lost the ability to resist the mysterious power of Teacher Square. No matter how serious his injuries were, he had to sit there and recite.</p>
<p>Everyone was horrified, but they could only sit there and recite. No words to describe their feelings any longer.</p>
<p>The blood-eyed black macaque roared and extended its claws to grab a person in front of it. Its nails were as sharp as daggers. If one were to be swiped by them, five bloody holes would probably appear on their head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned slightly. He couldn’t use any Companion Beasts on Teacher Square. Even his Essence Energy Art and body were suppressed, preventing him from summoning any Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>“What are those two fellows doing outside? Why aren’t they coming over to help?” Zhou Wen realized that the antelope and chick were standing on a distant mountain path. They were looking over, but they had no intention of coming over to help. It was as though they were watching a show.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but curse inwardly. I raised you all this while for nothing. To think you are there watching this with relish. Don’t you know that people will die? It’s fine if others die, but I’m here. Wouldn’t I end up dying with them later?</p>
<p>That’s not right. They cultivate in Confucian Essence Energy Arts, but I’m different. I can switch to the Dao Sutra and be sent out by the power of Teacher Square. With a thought, Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate to switch to Dao Sutra.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to think of a way to save them after he left, but he realized that Sister Gui and company were too close to the blood-eyed black macaque. It would probably be too late by the time he returned.</p>
<p>Forget it. I was planning on trying to see if the jade infant can be reconstituted after collapsing anyway. I’ll give it a try now. At the instant Zhou Wen switched to the Dao Body, he unleashed the power of the jade infant.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The terrifying power on Teacher Square struck Zhou Wen like divine lightning from the nine heavens. The jade infant suffered an extremely terrifying taboo attack.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sat motionless on the ground as he forcefully endured the terrifying taboo force. Taking advantage of the instant his body could move, he drew his saber and slashed at the blood-eyed black macaque.</p>
<p>Everyone was already in despair. The people who were going to bear the brunt of the attack in the first wave had already closed their eyes in resignation.</p>
<p>However, a blood-colored saber beam suddenly flashed. The blood-eyed black macaque’s body was split into two as both pieces fell to the sides.</p>
<h3 id='chapter722'>Chapter 722: Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>As they watched the blood-eyed black macaque die, everyone felt as though they had escaped death. They were still in disbelief.</p>
<p>Even Xu Tong wasn’t a match for the blood-eyed black macaque. Who had halved it?</p>
<p>Their heads couldn’t move, but their eyeballs could. Everyone looked in the direction of the saber beam and saw Zhou Wen sitting on the ground with a saber in hand. The blade had already returned to its scabbard.</p>
<p>It’s him? The girl sitting beside Sister Gui was taken aback. She couldn’t believe that Zhou Wen was the one who had killed the blood-eyed black macaque.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had returned the saber to its scabbard, but he sat there motionless with his eyes closed. He wasn’t sent flying by the power of Teacher Square, nor did he continue reciting.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen forcefully resisted the rules of Teacher Square, the jade infant suffered the brunt of the terrifying taboo power. It didn’t last long before shattering.</p>
<p>With the jade infant shattered, Zhou Wen originally imagined that he would be severely injured. At best, he would vomit blood, but the worst situation would be having his Dao Sutra crippled.</p>
<p>However, that wasn’t the case. After the jade infant shattered, the power that formed the Life Soul didn’t dissipate. Instead, it reformed again and completed the restructuring in an instant.</p>
<p>The reassembled Life Soul looked extremely strange. Its appearance was completely different from the jade infant’s. It had turned into something extremely strange.</p>
<p>Now, his Life Soul looked like a book, but he couldn’t open it. There were no words on the cover.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t sense any powerful force from the ancient book-like Life Soul, but he knew that the Dao Sutra Life Soul had successfully advanced.</p>
<p>This was because he was currently in Teacher Square. The Dao Sutra in his body was still circulating, but the taboo power in Teacher Sutra seemed to have vanished. It was completely useless against him.</p>
<p>When he opened his eyes and looked around, he saw that Sister Gui and company were still reciting under the power of Teacher Square. Zhou Wen knew that he had really succeeded.</p>
<p>With his Life Soul complete, Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to continue listening to their recital. He got up and said to Sister Gui, “Sister Gui, thank you for taking care of me these past few days. I’m leaving.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t really like farewells. Coincidentally, Sister Gui was still reciting, so she couldn’t speak to him. Zhou Wen waved at her before turning around and walking out of Teacher Square. He quickly left Mount Confucius with the antelope and chick.</p>
<p>When everyone saw that Zhou Wen could move freely on Teacher Square without being affected by its power, they were convinced that he was the person who had killed the blood-eyed black macaque.</p>
<p>When the recital ended, everyone regained their freedom.</p>
<p>“I could tell long ago that Little Zhou is extraordinary. I was right.”</p>
<p>“Bullsh*t. You always liked to call him silly.”</p>
<p>“What do you know? I was just joking with him. How can an ordinary person have such great perseverance? He’s clearly not an ordinary person. I’ve long seen how different he is.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think he’s even twenty years old. To have such a cultivation level, he probably comes from the families of the six heroes, right?”</p>
<p>“I think it’s very likely. Apart from the families of the six heroes, which family can nurture such a young talent?”</p>
<p>Sister Gui couldn’t take it anymore. She rolled her eyes at them and said, “Which of the six hero families have the surname Zhou?”</p>
<p>“Apparently none!” Everyone looked at each other, momentarily unable to guess Zhou Wen’s origins.</p>
<p>The girl looked in the direction Zhou Wen had left with mixed feelings.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen left Five Dragons Mouth. His identity had definitely been exposed this time, so he didn’t head to the other dimensional zones.</p>
<p>The main reason was that he hadn’t found the tiny palm symbol at Five Dragons Mouth. If he were to stay here to study it, it would probably take him more than a year to figure out the entire Five Dragons Mouth dimensional zone.</p>
<p>When he arrived at an uninhabited spot, he summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull. As Zhou Wen rode the bull, he checked the game’s information.</p>
<p>The Dao Body’s Life Soul was no longer Gods Retreat. It had changed again.</p>
<p>Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder (Perfect Body): Before the chaos was separated, there was no heaven or earth, no Yin or Yang, no sun or moon, no crystal or light, no east or west, no south or north, no front or back, no source or sink. Infinite changes, grand and majestic, formless and intangible, natural and mysterious. Destitution to the limits, boundless and immeasurable, only the Highest Elder…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t understand what the introduction meant, but it sounded very impressive even though he didn’t know what it was for.</p>
<p>In the past, Zero Taboo and Gods Retreat could only exist in his consciousness and not be summoned.</p>
<p>Now that it had transformed into the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, Zhou Wen’s mind stirred. The Life Soul that resembled an ancient jade scripture appeared in front of him. Despite it clearly being named Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, there wasn’t a single word on it. Zhou Wen couldn’t open it either. After studying it for a while, he realized that its use was only to resist taboo powers. He didn’t discover any other effects.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried in Netherworld City again and realized that the taboo power in Netherworld City was useless against the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. Only now could Zhou Wen be said to be truly a person of zero taboos.</p>
<p>The jade infant from Gods Retreat couldn’t last long in Netherworld City. Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to be tortured, so he hadn’t been able to reach the Netherworld Divine Throne in-game.</p>
<p>Now that he had the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, none of the taboos were effective against Zhou Wen and the blood-colored avatar. Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to walk along the stone path that didn’t even reveal the numbers.</p>
<p>However, when he stepped onto the stone slab, punishment ghosts would still appear. Zhou Wen casually killed them and quickly reached the Netherworld Divine Throne.</p>
<p>Yet, he didn’t see City Lord Netherworld in-game. After Zhou Wen sounded the Golden Bell, the Golden Divine Throne automatically separated, revealing the door to leave.</p>
<p>After leaving the door, the blood-colored avatar came out of the Netherworld City dungeon.</p>
<p>Is this all there is to the Netherworld City dungeon? There isn’t even a Mythical boss? Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Thinking back to what City Lord Netherworld had said to him, Zhou Wen’s heart stirred. Could it be that I really have to pay a visit to all the torture chambers as City Lord Netherworld said and endure all the punishments before I can see the real Netherworld City? What is the real Netherworld City?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was very interested in the secrets of Netherworld City, but he gave up when he thought of the punishments.</p>
<p>When I have the chance in the future, I’ll take Li Xuan to Netherworld City in real life and let him suffer the punishments. Then, I’ll know what the real Netherworld City is like. Zhou Wen placed his sights on Li Xuan.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen left Five Dragons Mouth, his deeds spread around the area. Everyone nearby knew of this young man, but they didn’t know his name. All they knew was that his surname was Zhou.</p>
<p>Even so, this matter was still detected by the bureau.</p>
<h3 id='chapter723'>Chapter 723: The Antelope Leads the Way</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Minister Qiao, are you sure the person who appeared at Five Dragons Mouth is Zhou Wen?” Shen Yuchi asked with a frown as he looked at the report delivered by Qiao Siyuan.</p>
<p>“I’ve confirmed his age and appearance. It matches Zhou Wen in many areas,” Qiao Siyuan answered respectfully.</p>
<p>“It’s normal for young people at this age to have similar looks,” Shen Yuchi said.</p>
<p>“Director-General, you’re right. However, I still think that the young man who appeared at Five Dragons Mouth is Zhou Wen,” Qiao Siyuan said.</p>
<p>“What evidence do you have?” Shen Yuchi asked.</p>
<p>“We’re still investigating, but there’s nothing new for the time being. However, my intuition tells me that it’s Zhou Wen,” Qiao Siyuan said with certainty.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi wasn’t angered by Qiao Siyuan’s seemingly irresponsible words. In fact, in their line of work, their intuition was sometimes very accurate.</p>
<p>Intuition wasn’t just a blind guess. It was a sharp sense of an event’s systematic development that they had honed after experiencing countless incidents.</p>
<p>“If that young man is Zhou Wen, why do you think he went to Five Dragons Mouth? What’s his next destination?” Shen Yuchi said after some thought.</p>
<p>“According to intelligence, someone has been seeing Zhou Wen in the vicinity of Luoyang recently. However, I feel that this may be a ruse from the An family. Their goal is to cover Zhou Wen. According to this inference, Zhou Wen’s goal isn’t as simple as staying at Five Dragons Mouth for a period of time.”</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan paused before continuing, “I’m guessing that Zhou Wen won’t be returning to Luoyang next. According to his current trajectory, he should be heading north. I think he might come to the Imperial Capital.”</p>
<p>“There are so many cities in the north. Why do you think that he will definitely come to the Imperial Capital?” Shen Yuchi frowned.</p>
<p>“I don’t have any evidence yet, but it’s best to make some preparations,” Qiao Siyuan said.</p>
<p>“That’s right. However, Zhou Wen has already reached a certain level of attainment. Even without the An family’s protection, it won’t be easy to touch him,” Shen Yuchi said after some thought.</p>
<p>“Director-General, why don’t you discuss it with the Xia family? Perhaps they are also interested in Zhou Wen,” Qiao Siyuan said.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi naturally understood what Qiao Siyuan was referring to. He glanced at Qiao Siyuan and said meaningfully, “Then help me make a trip to the Xia family and inform them of this matter.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.” Qiao Siyuan received the order.</p>
<p>After Qiao Siyuan left, the woman Shen Yuchi called “Button” walked out. Shen Yuchi looked at the documents and said, “What’s your take?”</p>
<p>“Qiao Siyuan’s attention on Zhou Wen seems to have exceeded the attention he places on Wang Mingyuan’s other disciples,” said Button.</p>
<p>“Are you saying that he has ulterior motives for Zhou Wen?” Shen Yuchi looked up at Button.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I’ve investigated him. Just as you said, Director-General, this person is too simple. His life seems to revolve around nothing but work. He doesn’t have any obvious personal hobbies, no wife, children, family, or friends. He doesn’t even have a lover. He doesn’t eat, drink, prostitute, or gamble. It’s hard to imagine how he does it given his age and status,” said Button.</p>
<p>“Perhaps he’s a workaholic,” Shen Yuchi said.</p>
<p>Button’s red lips curled up slightly as she continued, “You can say that, but as a workaholic, he doesn’t seem to be so focused on other parts of his work.”</p>
<p>“Then why do you think Qiao Siyuan mentioned the Xia family?” Shen Yuchi continued.</p>
<p>“There’s no way to deduce it for the time being. However, from what I know, in the past few decades, there have been many young geniuses who died young, and all of them have something to do with the Xia family. If the Xia family learns of Zhou Wen’s arrival in the Imperial Capital, perhaps there’s really no need for you to think about it, Director-General.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s take a wait and see approach for now.” Shen Yuchi lowered his head and continued working.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen traversed mountains and forests. Although the dimensional storms had brought a huge calamity to humanity, Earth was brimming with vitality. It was unlike the past where everywhere was filled with buildings made of concrete and steel.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? It’s not over there. We’re going this way.” When they reached a fork in the road, Zhou Wen was supposed to take the left fork, but the antelope actually walked to the right.</p>
<p>The antelope ignored him and bit Zhou Wen’s sleeve as it walked to the right, forcing him to follow.</p>
<p>“What’s here? Why do you have to walk this way?” Zhou Wen found it odd. Although the antelope had been very willful and aloof in the past, it had never interfered with Zhou Wen’s actions.</p>
<p>This time, the antelope had taken the initiative to alter his path. This left Zhou Wen somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>The antelope didn’t answer as it walked ahead as though it hadn’t heard Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen stopped and didn’t leave, it would come over to pull him back.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen studied the map. The right fork was originally a road, but because there were too many dimensional zones there, as well as the appearance of many break-out creatures, it was abandoned due to the danger.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that there was definitely something going on and he was somewhat intrigued. He wanted to know what the antelope was up to, so he followed it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen summoned Six-Winged to prevent any accidents.</p>
<p>He hadn’t managed to successfully create a Substitute Talisman yet. He had drawn quite a number of them whenever he was free, but unfortunately, he hadn’t succeeded. The success rate of producing a Substitute Talisman was just too low.</p>
<p>Due to the encroachment of the plants on both sides of the originally spacious road, many branches and roots were strewn across the road. Green vines crawled everywhere.</p>
<p>The trees on both sides of the road were extremely tall. The tree crowns were squeezed together, blocking out the sunlight. Zhou Wen felt that walking on the road was no different from walking in a forest.</p>
<p>As he walked, Zhou Wen suddenly felt that something was amiss. There were trees everywhere, but there wasn’t a single bird or insect in the huge forest. The entire forest was terrifyingly quiet.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already expanded Truth Listener’s range to its limits, but he still didn’t discover any animals. There wasn’t even an ant.</p>
<p>How can this be? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown as he secretly became wary.</p>
<p>The antelope remained oblivious as it continued walking ahead. The chick stood on Zhou Wen’s shoulder and looked around curiously.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” Zhou Wen asked the antelope in front of him.</p>
<p>The antelope didn’t know how to speak at all. Even if it could speak, it had no intention of answering Zhou Wen. Just as Zhou Wen was hesitating about following it down, it suddenly left the road and burrowed into the grass beside it.</p>
<p>It was a dense grass patch and many vines coiled together. After the antelope entered, it immediately vanished. Thankfully, Zhou Wen had Truth Listener and could see the situation in the grass.</p>
<p>After the antelope burrowed into the grass, it continued walking in. Soon, it arrived at an empty spot.</p>
<p>The empty spot was rather strange. There were dense plants all around, but there was not a single blade of grass growing in that small area. It was as if a strong weed killer had been used.</p>
<h3 id='chapter724'>Chapter 724: 100% Head Turner</h3>
<p>1</p>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The antelope walked to the clearing and began digging with its hooves.</p>
<p>Could there be some treasure buried there? Zhou Wen was curious as he burrowed into the grass and quickly arrived beside the clearing.</p>
<p>The antelope dug very quickly. By the time Zhou Wen arrived, it had already dug more than a meter deep. The soil dug out was piled up beside it.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw the soil, he immediately knew why there weren’t any plants growing here. The antelope wasn’t digging out soil, but grayish-black ash. It looked like it was mixed with some form of metallic powder.</p>
<p>He looked into the pit and saw that there was indeed metallic powder underneath.</p>
<p>“Ol’ Ante, what are you digging?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>The antelope ignored him and continued digging.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, This antelope usually acts like a big shot. It sees everything beneath it and is the laziest. It’s like a lord that enjoys life and doesn’t do anything. Now that it’s digging a hole by itself, there must be something good down there.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen said with a smile, “Ol’ Ante, it’s not convenient for you to dig with your hooves. Why don’t I help you dig? If there’s anything good down there, why don’t you share half with me?”</p>
<p>The antelope glanced at him and after some thought, it raised its front hooves and gestured at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was puzzled as he thought to himself, You only have a hoof. There aren’t any fingers. What does your gesturing mean?</p>
<p>Seeing that he didn’t understand, the antelope wrote “20%” on the ground.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen understand what the antelope meant by its hoof gesture. There was a groove in front of its hooves, making it look like a V. It could also represent two.</p>
<p>“Twenty percent is too little. How about forty-sixty?” The antelope ignored him and continued digging.</p>
<p>“So be it. 20%. I’ll help you dig.” Zhou Wen felt that he had nothing better to do. He could help dig and save time. Furthermore, he could split the benefits. Why not?</p>
<p>The antelope jumped out of the hole and pointed down, indicating for him to dig.</p>
<p>Why would Zhou Wen dig it himself? He summoned Tyrant Behemoth. The two horns on Tyrant Behemoth’s head were like spinning electric drills as it dug at a fast speed.</p>
<p>What surprised Zhou Wen was that the metallic powder below was indeed extraordinary. Despite Tyrant Behemoth’s immense strength, it failed to easily penetrate the metallic powder.</p>
<p>After drilling for a while, it had dug a hole more than ten meters deep. The metallic powder it dug out turned darker and darker like coal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the metallic powder had a smell. It wasn’t pungent, but it resembled the smell of ink on a newspaper.</p>
<p>“Ol’ Ante, what’s down there? How deep do we have to dig?” Zhou Wen knew that the antelope was very intelligent and could definitely answer him. It depended on its willingness to speak.</p>
<p>The antelope extended its hoof and drew two words on the ground: “Eight meters.”</p>
<p>“There are still eight meters to go? It looks like this digging will go on for a little while longer.” Zhou Wen did some calculations. The metallic powder was getting harder to dig the deeper it went. He estimated that it would have to dig for another forty to fifty minutes.</p>
<p>After some thought, he decided to take out his phone to grind dungeons for a while. He would wait until Tyrant Behemoth dug out the item.</p>
<p>After grinding dungeons for a while, he didn’t get anything good.</p>
<p>The antelope suddenly nudged him with its hooves. Zhou Wen knew that something had been dug out. He walked to the side of the deep pit and looked down. He saw that Tyrant Behemoth had dug a twenty to thirty-meter deep pit.</p>
<p>However, Tyrant Behemoth’s body was too huge. It nearly blocked the entire mouth of the pit. Zhou Wen had no choice but to let it out before looking down.</p>
<p>This time, he saw something in the deep pit. It looked like a wooden stake with a diameter of about fifty to sixty centimeters. It was completely black, but there were tree lines on the surface. It was probably wood.</p>
<p>The antelope pointed at the log and nudged Zhou Wen. Clearly, it wanted Zhou Wen to bring the log up.</p>
<p>Although the log looked huge, Zhou Wen had plenty of strength too. Even if it weighed several tons, it wouldn’t be a problem for him.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to take the risk. He got Tyrant Behemoth to go down and pull out the wooden stake.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth hugged the wooden stake with its claws and pulled with all its might. The wooden stake wasn’t pulled straight out. It only moved a little and rose by ten to twenty centimeters.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth pulled it out bit by bit, revealing more and more of the wooden stake. When the wooden stake was completely out, it was about three meters long.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth placed the wooden stake on the ground. Zhou Wen carefully sized it up and realized that it was indeed a log. It was likely a segment of a certain tree, and the bark was rather pristine.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what kind of log it was. The bark and tree core were black, about the blackness of charcoal, but it wasn’t dirty at all when touched. It was a little cold.</p>
<p>“Ol’ Ante, is this the treasure?” Zhou Wen asked the antelope.</p>
<p>The antelope nodded and circled the log a few times as though it was examining something.</p>
<p>What’s the use of this log? Zhou Wen didn’t discover anything special about it. Apart from being a little black and heavy, it didn’t seem to be anything special.</p>
<p>The antelope pointed at the log and then at Zhou Wen’s shoulder, indicating for him to carry it.</p>
<p>“If you don’t have a place to put it, I’ll help you store it. Ask me when you need it,” Zhou Wen hurriedly said.</p>
<p>The antelope glanced at Zhou Wen, making him feel a little uncertain. However, he never expected the antelope to nod in agreement.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he reached out to lift the log. He realized that it wasn’t as heavy as he imagined. He could still lift it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that he wouldn’t be able to lift it since Tyrant Behemoth had exerted so much strength to pull it out.</p>
<p>After opening the chaos space, Zhou Wen placed the large log piece inside.</p>
<p>“Ol’ Ante, what’s the use of that log? Tell me.” Zhou Wen wanted to obtain some information from the antelope. Otherwise, it would be useless even if the entire log was his.</p>
<p>The antelope ignored him and crawled out of the grass before returning along the path. Clearly, it was here to dig up the log and didn’t plan on disturbing Zhou Wen’s advance.</p>
<p>After returning to the fork, Zhou Wen took the correct path and continued heading for Imperial Capital.</p>
<p>After walking for a while, Zhou Wen suddenly felt something amiss. He felt uncomfortable, but he couldn’t tell what was wrong.</p>
<p>Am I reading too much into it? Zhou Wen carefully checked his surroundings with Truth Listener, but he didn’t discover any problems.</p>
<p>After a long journey, he entered a city. That’s when Zhou Wen realized that something was amiss. This was because the people walking towards him, be they men or women, were looking at him with strange eyes. Some women were even giggling at his face.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Zhou Wen was puzzled. Although he felt that he was good looking, his handsomeness wasn’t to the point of being loved by everyone. To be such a head-turner with a 100% rate creeped him out a little.</p>
<h3 id='chapter725'>Chapter 725: Riding A Bull and Carrying Wood</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly found an empty spot and took out a mirror from his chaos space to take a look at his face.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately stunned.</p>
<p>There was a pitch-black word, “slave,” on his originally smooth forehead. It looked as if it had been written in ink, and was written beautifully.</p>
<p>“Ol’ Ante, what’s going on? Are you up to no good?” Zhou Wen hurriedly rubbed it with his hand, but no matter how he rubbed it, the word “slave” seemed to be embedded into his flesh. Despite abrading his skin, the word “slave” was still clearly visible.</p>
<p>The antelope wore an innocent expression like a human. Then, it wrote a line on the ground with its hooves. “I told you to carry it, but you didn’t. You can’t blame me.”</p>
<p>“You mean that piece of wood?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>The antelope nodded with a faint smile as it looked at the word “slave” on Zhou Wen’s head with an admiring gaze.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly took out the wooden log from the chaos space and placed it on the ground. He asked the antelope in an extremely distrustful tone, “Tell me honestly, what is this?”</p>
<p>The antelope looked at Zhou Wen with an innocent look as though it was saying: “I’m just an antelope. I can’t speak.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to grit his teeth and ask, “Will the word on my forehead disappear if I carry it?”</p>
<p>The antelope quickly nodded as though it was waiting for Zhou Wen to say that.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had tried all sorts of methods to remove the mark on his forehead to no avail. All he could do was give it a try. He raised one end of the log with both hands and lifted it with his shoulder.</p>
<p>The log was really heavy. Even with Zhou Wen’s strength, he found it difficult to lift it up.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen looked into the mirror, he realized that the slave word on his forehead had really vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen placed the log on the ground and the word “slave” appeared again. When he lifted it up, it vanished.</p>
<p>“Ol’ Ante, what the hell is this? Are you expecting me to carry it all the time?” Zhou Wen felt like killing the antelope, but he was no match against it.</p>
<p>Antelope didn’t give excuses. It drew another line of words on the ground with its hooves. “Go to the Imperial Capital and terminate the contract.”</p>
<p>“You mean that as long as we get it to the Imperial Capital, we can terminate this contract?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Seeing the antelope nod, Zhou Wen asked, “Then can I put it away and take it to the Imperial Capital?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen planned on wearing a hat to cover the word “slave” on his forehead. The log was just too heavy. He could forget about doing anything while carrying it.</p>
<p>“If you aren’t afraid of death, sure.” The antelope wrote a few succinct words.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately felt his balls ache as he thought to himself, If I had known this would happen, I wouldn’t have shot my mouth and tried to share the benefits with the antelope.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen realized that something was amiss.</p>
<p>With the antelope’s usual lazy personality, it wouldn’t have dug itself. It would definitely have gotten Zhou Wen to help it.</p>
<p>However, it had started the digging itself and at an extremely slow pace. Zhou Wen realized from recalling the sequence of events that the antelope was clearly trying to entice him into offering his help.</p>
<p>What kind of society is this? Even an antelope will lie? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. It was too late to say anything now. If he were to question the antelope now, not only would it not help matters, but he would also be making a fool of himself.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it just carrying a log to the Imperial Capital? What’s the big deal? I, Zhou Wen, have nothing else but strength,” Zhou Wen said as he lifted the piece of wood.</p>
<p>How freaking heavy! Zhou Wen took a few steps and felt his body break out in sweat.</p>
<p>The log was about three meters long and was about fifty to sixty centimeters in diameter. Its density and weight were about the same as steel. Zhou Wen found it taxing.</p>
<p>After walking half a street, Zhou Wen felt that he couldn’t let things continue. He would probably die of exhaustion on the way before he reached the Imperial Capital.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull. He carried the wooden log and got the bull to carry him. This way, he could save some strength.</p>
<p>“This isn’t against the rules, right?” Zhou Wen looked at the antelope.</p>
<p>The antelope nodded and didn’t object.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief and ordered the Great Might Vajra Bull to continue traveling. He was in no mood to carry such a piece of wood. All he wanted to do now was rush to the Imperial Capital and get rid of the slave word on his forehead.</p>
<p>“Is that person a fool? He’s riding a bull and carrying a piece of wood? Doesn’t he know that he can place the piece of wood on the bull’s back?”</p>
<p>“You don’t understand. He’s just showing off.”</p>
<p>“In what sense?”</p>
<p>“He’s showing off his great strength that he’s able to carry such a huge log. He’s showing off his ferocious mount that’s capable of lifting him and the log together.”</p>
<p>“Haha, that makes sense, but no matter how I look at it, I find him a little foolish!”</p>
<p>Wherever Zhou Wen passed, people wagged their tongues at him as though they were looking at a fool. The number of heads turning became even higher than before.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored them and urged the Great Might Vajra Bull to speed up. He hoped to leave the city as soon as possible. Once he entered the wilderness, there wouldn’t be so many people gawking at him.</p>
<p>“Interesting!” On the second floor of a cafe, three men were sitting by the window and drinking coffee. One of the men saw Zhou Wen riding the Great Might Vajra Bull.</p>
<p>The other two men looked towards the street and immediately discovered Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>One of the men’s eyes suddenly lit up as he said to the other two men, “Dugu Ge, Zhang Chunqiu, why don’t we use that person as a bet and decide the ownership of that thing?”</p>
<p>“Tell me about it,” Dugu Ge said expressionlessly.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu also smiled and nodded. “As long as it’s fair, I have no objections.”</p>
<p>“It’s definitely fair. Let’s guess when that person will put down the log on his shoulder. Whoever guesses the closest time will get the thing. What do you think?” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>“Sure,” Dugu Ge said directly.</p>
<p>“I have no objections,” said Zhang Chunqiu.</p>
<p>“Eh, you guys actually didn’t suspect that I arranged this person? Could it be that you guys know him?” Xia Liuchuan asked, a little surprised.</p>
<p>“Wang Mingyuan’s disciple, adopted son of Madam Lan of the An family. It’s quite difficult to not know him these days,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“So he’s Zhou Wen.” Xia Liuchuan thought for a moment before smiling again. “That’s good. None of us will be at a disadvantage by using a third party as a bet. It’ll be fair and square. No one will complain even if they lose.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Xia Liuchuan continued, “If it were an ordinary person, after hearing so much from wagging tongues, he would probably put down the log very quickly. Since he’s not an ordinary person, it depends on when he plans to put down the log to rest. I guess it won’t take long. It should be around seven in the evening. What do you think?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter726'>Chapter 726: Sister Return Lightning Pool</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“With the bull’s gait, it should arrive at the nearest city around seven or eight in the evening. If Zhou Wen doesn’t wish to sleep in the wilderness, the chances of him spending the night there is very high. It makes sense to guess seven,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a smile.</p>
<p>“I can’t compare to Brother Zhang’s clairvoyance. It’s just a random guess,” Xia Liuchuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll make a random guess too. 7:01,” Zhang Chunqiu said in all seriousness.</p>
<p>“Since you are guessing 7:01. Then I’ll guess 6:59,” Dugu Ge added.</p>
<p>“Hey hey, aren’t you guys going overboard?” Xia Liuchuan said unhappily.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu replied with a smile, “Actually, it’s too easy to guess the time. Why don’t we change what we are betting on?”</p>
<p>“What else can we guess other than time?” Xia Liuchuan couldn’t think of anything else.</p>
<p>“Let’s guess which city he’s taking that piece of wood to. What do you think?” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s bet on that. I’ll let you guys guess first this time,” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. Let’s write it on paper and open them together.” Zhang Chunqiu handed paper and pen to Xia Liuchuan and Dugu Ge.</p>
<p>The three of them gave their answers and opened them together.</p>
<p>After looking at each other’s answers, the three of them looked at each other in dismay. Among the three of them, two of them wrote the Imperial Capital, while Xia Liuchuan wrote the Capital.</p>
<p>However, the Imperial Capital and the Capital were basically the same. It was just that the locals of the Imperial Capital were more used to calling it the Capital.</p>
<p>“It looks like we can’t bet on this either.” Xia Liuchuan smiled.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we make it simpler? We’ll bet on whether he can reach the Imperial Capital alive,” Dugu Ge said.</p>
<p>“There are only two answers—yes or no. How are the three of us going to bet?” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>“That’s simple. Reaching the Imperial Capital alive, reaching the Imperial Capital after he’s dead, and not being able to reach the Imperial Capital. Isn’t that three options? The time limit is a month. What do you think?” Dugu Ge said.</p>
<p>“That makes sense. Who will choose first?” Xia Liuchuan looked at Dugu Ge.</p>
<p>“Since I was the one who suggested the rules, I’ll make the final choice,” Dugu Ge said.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu wore a heavy expression as he did some calculations. After a while, he said, “If no one wants to snatch the option from me, I’ll choose the option that he reaches the Imperial Capital after he’s dead.”</p>
<p>“I won’t vie with you for that choice. I’ll choose the option that he reaches the Capital alive,” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>“Then the remaining choice is mine. I guess he won’t be able to reach the Imperial Capital,” Dugu Ge said.</p>
<p>“In that case, let’s travel together and follow him. Let’s see the outcome,” Zhang Chunqiu suggested.</p>
<p>“Fine with me.” Dugu Ge stood up.</p>
<p>The three of them left the cafe and chased after Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carried the wooden log and left the city. Although he was riding the Great Might Vajra Bull, he still needed to expend a lot of stamina to carry the wooden log. When he left the city, Zhou Wen’s forehead was already beading with sweat, and his clothes were drenched.</p>
<p>Helpless, Zhou Wen could only switch to the Ancient Sovereign Sutra and fuse with the Defy Ancient Sovereign Life Soul. With the augmentation of the powerful lifeforce, he could continue while carrying the log.</p>
<p>The Great Might Vajra Bull wasn’t having an easy time either. It slowed down significantly and its speed was nothing like usual. It ran like an old bull dragging a cart.</p>
<p>Not long after leaving the city and entering the mountains, the sky suddenly darkened. Dark clouds covered the sky as lightning bolts flashed like divine dragons. Occasionally, ferocious shadows would appear in the dark clouds.</p>
<p>Is it going to rain? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown when he heard the thunder. He stared at the thick, dark clouds.</p>
<p>Dugu Ge, Zhang Chunqiu, and Xia Liuchuan followed behind Zhou Wen from afar. They didn’t chase too closely. With Zhang Chunqiu, who was clairvoyant, there was no need to be afraid of losing him, nor did they need to get too close.</p>
<p>At that moment, they also saw the dark clouds and lightning that filled the sky. However, they weren’t as optimistic as Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Chunqiu, what do you think?” Xia Liuchuan stared at the dark clouds in the sky with a serious expression.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu did a simple divination and said, “An ominous omen…”</p>
<p>“Don’t try to fool me with those charlatan methods. I want to hear the truth.” Xia Liuchuan interrupted Zhang Chunqiu.</p>
<p>“To be honest, a break-out creature is about to appear. Furthermore, it doesn’t look too weak. From the looks of it, you will be busy,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Among the three of them, only Xia Liuchuan needed Zhou Wen to reach the capital alive to win the bet. He naturally wouldn’t let Zhou Wen die here. As long as he could win, Xia Liuchuan didn’t mind helping Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>As they spoke, Zhou Wen sped up, hoping to reach the city earlier.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the log was too heavy. Even if the Great Might Vajra Bull ran with all its might, it couldn’t run fast.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu pinched his fingers, divining as he walked. He looked around and suddenly, his expression changed as he shouted, “That’s not right!”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Xia Liuchuan asked curiously.</p>
<p>Before Zhang Chunqiu could answer, he heard an explosion in the sky. A bolt of lightning descended from the sky and struck a nearby forest.</p>
<p>Strangely, when the lightning struck the forest, there were visible electric arcs. The forest that was enveloped by the lightning only flashed with lightning, but there was no fire.</p>
<p>And this was only the beginning. Large swaths of lightning kept striking the forest, covering all the plants with a layer of lightning. However, the plants didn’t die. Instead, they became more spirited.</p>
<p>“Thunder-trigram above, lake-trigram below. It’s Sister Return Lightning Pool. It looks like things aren’t looking good,” Zhang Chunqiu said as he did the calculations.</p>
<p>After spending some time with Zhang Chunqiu, Xia Liuchuan had a basic understanding of divination. Upon hearing that, he said, “I don’t think it’s a dangerous divination, right? I remember hearing you say that Sister Return Lightning Pool means that in order to obtain greater benefits, one needs to pay a certain price in exchange. It’s just like marrying off one’s sister.”</p>
<p>“Although what you said isn’t entirely correct, it’s not too far off. However…” Before Zhang Chunqiu could finish his sentence, he suddenly saw the plants that were covered in lightning seem to come alive. Their leaves and branches trembled as they shot out bolts of lightning.</p>
<p>Instantly, the criss-crossing lightning enveloped Xia Liuchuan and company.</p>
<p>This level of lightning naturally didn’t affect them much. Xia Liuchuan shattered the lightning with a wave of his hand.</p>
<p>Thunder boomed in the sky again. This time, the thunder was especially loud, causing the entire mountain range to tremble. And in the dark clouds in the sky, a ball of green lightning fell like a meteor.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A large area of the forest was destroyed as a figure emitting lightning appeared in the ruins.</p>
<h3 id='chapter727'>Chapter 727: Hotel</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Xia Liuchuan looked over and saw that it was a tiger with wings on its back. Azure lightning danced on its body as though every cell was flashing with lightning.</p>
<p>The tiger immediately saw Xia Liuchuan and the other two. It flapped its wings and instantly transformed into lightning.</p>
<p>“Not good!” Xia Liuchuan’s expression changed as he summoned an ancient sword. The ancient sword split into two at every turn until there were eight. It transformed into a sword formation that resembled a metallic wall of copper and iron that defended Xia Liuchuan.</p>
<p>Dugu Ge rapidly retreated like a ghost. He was unbelievably fast. Zhou Wen’s all-out use of Transcendent Flying Immortal was not much better.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu flicked his sleeve and talismans appeared in front of him, turning into a talisman formation that protected his body.</p>
<p>At that instant, an azure bolt of lightning tore through the sky and transformed into a lightning net. Instantly, it enveloped the sword formation and the talisman formation. No matter how fast Dugu Ge’s movement technique was, he wasn’t as fast as the lightning. He was also enveloped.</p>
<p>Rumble!</p>
<p>The sword formation shattered and the talismans were burned. The might of the lightning was like heavenly punishment that could destroy everything.</p>
<p>“Ah!” The three of them cried out tragically as their bodies convulsed from the lightning. Their hair was smoking.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, who was riding with the wooden log on his shoulder, looked in the direction behind him in puzzlement. He saw lightning striking in the distant mountain, producing incessant rumbling sounds. He couldn’t help but mutter to himself, “Why is this lightning so terrifying? Could it be that the lightning and rain have mutated? From the looks of it, I should rush to the city ahead and find a place to stay.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen urged the Great Might Vajra Bull, hoping that it could run faster.</p>
<p>However, the big guy was panting in exhaustion. It had no way of running any faster.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat worried. The dimensionalization was still limited to Earth itself and didn’t involve the satellites outside. Therefore, the Federation could still guarantee basic communication with artificial satellites.</p>
<p>If the artificial satellites were affected in the future, the means of communication would be even weaker.</p>
<p>Thunder rumbled in the distance as bolts of lightning descended from the sky. The sound of thunder was terrifying.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen wasn’t struck by lightning. He rushed all the way and finally arrived at a nearby city at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>The lightning in the mountains rumbled, but it wasn’t that terrifying in the city. It was just a little cloudy. There was a drizzle that didn’t feel cold. It felt refreshing when the rain landed on his skin.</p>
<p>This city was relatively small. After the dimensional storms, it had suffered a serious loss of population. Now, very few shops opened on both sides of the streets. There were very few pedestrians. Most of them had probably moved to a large city.</p>
<p>This was a good thing for Zhou Wen. At the very least, there weren’t many onlookers wagging their tongues at him as he rode on a bull and carried a log. Occasionally, pedestrians would pass by and look at him in surprise.</p>
<p>Not long after Zhou Wen entered the city, he saw a small hotel. The door of the hotel was open, but there was no one inside. The tables and couches were in a mess and there was quite a bit of dust on them. From the looks of it, the owner had already left.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen went in and found a room. He realized that there was a bed with a blanket in there, so he chose to stay.</p>
<p>In any case, he only needed to rest for a while before continuing on his journey. He didn’t have too high a requirement for a place to stay. All he needed to do was shield himself from the elements.</p>
<p>Shortly after Zhou Wen entered the hotel, it began pouring heavily outside. The rain seemed to be water from an overturned basin. In just a short period of time, rainwater began to pool on the roads. The sewers were unable to keep up with the quantity of rainwater.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I can only continue on my journey after the rain stops. Just as Zhou Wen was about to put down the log on his shoulder, the antelope suddenly tugged at him, indicating for him to look at the ground.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked down and saw a few words on the ground. It was obvious that the antelope had written them with its hooves.</p>
<p>“Body must remain inseparable from the log. Separation means certain death.”</p>
<p>“What do you want? This place is still far from the Imperial Capital. I can’t keep carrying it, right?” Zhou Wen said gloomily.</p>
<p>“Can’t you read? Do you not know what it means for your body to remain inseparable from the log” The antelope gave Zhou Wen a disdainful look before writing a line on the ground.</p>
<p>So that’s how it is. Is it fine as long as my body doesn’t leave the log? Zhou Wen placed the log on the ground and sat on it.</p>
<p>With his body greatly enervated, Zhou Wen could finally heave a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>This piece of wood was heavy. Even after using the power of the Defy Ancient Sovereign Life Soul, he still felt that his body couldn’t take it.</p>
<p>Since he couldn’t leave the log, he didn’t even need to sleep on the bed. Zhou Wen pulled a blanket over himself and slept on the log.</p>
<p>The antelope slept comfortably on the bed; so did the chick. It even covered itself with a blanket by pecking a rug over.</p>
<p>With the heavy rain outside, Zhou Wen didn’t dare rashly set off. He planned on leaving after the rain stopped.</p>
<p>“That’s not how you kick a ball…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was sleeping soundly when a voice suddenly sounded. It nearly made him jump up in fright.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen still remembered the words that the “body must remain inseparable from the log.” He forcefully stopped himself from leaping off the log.</p>
<p>When he opened his eyes and took a closer look, he realized that the television in the room had turned on and it was playing an old movie.</p>
<p>I was nearly scared to death. How did this crappy television switch on by itself? Zhou Wen turned his head and saw that the chick had woken up at some point in time. It was fiddling with a remote control with its claws.</p>
<p>“I’m sleeping. Stop fooling around.” Zhou Wen reached out and sucked the remote control over. Then, he used the remote control to turn off the television. Seeing that it was still early and that the rain was still pouring outside, Zhou Wen lay down and continued sleeping.</p>
<p>He had just fallen asleep when he was suddenly woken up by a sound.</p>
<p>“This move is clearly called An Old Man Pushing A Cart. Don’t write me off as ignorant…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was woken up again and saw the television turn on again. It was playing the old movie.</p>
<p>“Little Feifei, stop fooling around, alright? Let me rest for a while. I’m really tired.” Zhou Wen was just about to take the chick’s remote when he realized that the chick wasn’t holding the remote at all. The remote was still beside him. The chick crawled out of the blanket and looked at him blankly.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Did I touch the remote control myself? That’s not right… That’s not right… This hotel has been abandoned for some time. There’s no electricity. How can the television be switched on? Zhou Wen finally snapped out of his daze and sat up to carefully watch the television.</p>
<p>At this glance, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but change his expression. This was because the television’s power cable was hanging down. It wasn’t plugged in at all. Even if there was electricity in the hotel, it was impossible for the television to be switched on.</p>
<p>“Watch and see…” The old movie on the television was still playing. Zhou Wen frowned as he stared at the television and used Truth Listener to inspect it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter728'>Chapter 728: Concerned Person</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Truth Listener’s ability allowed Zhou Wen to hear the internal structure of the television.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t know much about circuit boards, nor did he notice anything amiss. He didn’t discover any Companion Beasts or dimensional creatures inside, but he realized that there was an electric current flowing inside.</p>
<p>It’s impossible for there to be no problems. Zhou Wen checked several times, but he failed to find anything wrong.</p>
<p>He tried turning the television off with the remote control, and it was switched off again. It looked no different from a normal television.</p>
<p>What the hell? Could it be that the electric current produced by the thunderstorm has run into the television, giving it electricity? Zhou Wen studied it for a long time, but he still couldn’t figure out why there was electricity in the television. However, even he couldn’t come to terms with his guess.</p>
<p>I want to see what’s messing around. Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to monitor the entire hotel and the nearby area. Nothing could escape his ears even in the heavy rain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sat on the log and stared at the television.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>After a while, thunder sounded in the sky again. It felt like the lightning was very close, as though it had exploded outside the building.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the television lit up and the movie started playing.</p>
<p>“Cut the crap. Take off… Ah, take off your clothes… Hey, what are you doing… Are you trying to kill me… You’re really amazing. I don’t even mind you beating me to death…”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept staring at the television, while Truth Listener kept monitoring all its components. However, for some reason, there was suddenly electricity in the television.</p>
<p>There were no suspicious signs inside or outside the inn. There was no one, nor were there any dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Strange. Could it be that the lightning outside has entered the television? Zhou Wen felt that this matter was odd. Ignoring the fact that the lightning couldn’t be transmitted in, even if it could, it would only damage the components. It was impossible for the television to work normally.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen didn’t switch off the television. He sat there watching. The television had plenty of power. It continued playing even after quite some time.</p>
<p>“Who can be more miserable than me!” A person on the television tragically cried out at the sky before collapsing to the ground.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but laugh when he saw this.</p>
<p>Although he found it odd, this old movie was still quite funny.</p>
<p>Even if there’s really someone causing trouble, I might only end up falling for someone’s scheme if I were to leave this place and enter the heavy rain. I’ll just take a wait and see approach for now. Zhou Wen decided to turn off the television and sleep on the log.</p>
<p>He kept Truth Listener’s ability active the entire time. Zhou Wen would immediately know of any movement. He also switched his Essence Energy Art to Dao Sutra. With the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder Life Soul, he could be somewhat safe.</p>
<p>The television kept playing old movies, one after another, but other than that, nothing else happened.</p>
<p>After sleeping deep into the night, Zhou Wen suddenly heard footsteps coming from the entrance of the hotel. He immediately woke up. With Truth Listener’s ability, he immediately saw a strange person run in.</p>
<p>The person’s clothes were tattered and his hair was charred black. He looked like he had just been struck by lightning.</p>
<p>He finally can’t hold back? Zhou Wen sat up and monitored the person’s every move.</p>
<p>After the person entered, he sniffed around before walking towards Zhou Wen’s room.</p>
<p>He’s indeed coming for me, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>When the person arrived at the door, Zhou Wen was waiting for him. He wanted to see what tricks he had up his sleeve, but he never expected the person to knock on the door a few times.</p>
<p>“Who is it?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised as he asked after some thought.</p>
<p>The person outside said, “Zhou Wen, I’m here to snitch. You have to be careful along the way. Someone wants you dead, and it’s not just one.”</p>
<p>“Who wants me dead?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“You should know the Dugu family and the Zhang family of the Federation’s six families, right? The Dugu family’s Dugu Ge and the Zhang family’s Zhang Chunqiu both want your life,” the person outside the door answered.</p>
<p>“I have no grudge with them. Why do they want me dead?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>This time, the person outside didn’t answer. Instead, he asked, “You’re going to the Imperial Capital, right?”</p>
<p>“What has my whereabouts got to do with them wanting to kill me?” Zhou Wen didn’t quite believe the person in front of him. This person looked problematic.</p>
<p>“They don’t want you to enter the Imperial Capital alive,” the person outside said.</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about the reason. Just be careful.” The person prepared to leave.</p>
<p>“Who are you? Why are you telling me this?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“Just call me Concerned Person,” the person said firmly and turned to go downstairs.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for the fact that his clothes were tattered and his hair was charred black, he would have looked rather cool.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found the name Concerned Person familiar. After being stunned for a while, he recalled that wasn’t the name used frequently in primary school composition?</p>
<p>Who is this person? Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>He naturally wouldn’t completely believe this person’s words, but from the looks of it, he really didn’t have any ill intentions.</p>
<p>Is he behind the television? Zhou Wen was somewhat unsure.</p>
<p>The television was still playing, so Zhou Wen didn’t think too much about it. He decided to sleep first and wait for the rain to stop. After all, he was determined to make this trip to the Imperial Capital. He would deal with whatever came his way. There was no use worrying.</p>
<p>Not long after he fell asleep, Zhou Wen heard someone enter the hotel again.</p>
<p>Tap! Tap! Tap!</p>
<p>After the person entered the hotel, he didn’t even take a sniff before heading to the second floor and running towards Zhou Wen’s room.</p>
<p>His appearance was similar to the person from before. He was also wearing tattered clothes and his hair was charred black. However, it was obvious that he wasn’t the same person. This person was taller.</p>
<p>Could it be that the person in question is here? Just as Zhou Wen was thinking, the person had already arrived at the door. He had actually raised his hand to knock.</p>
<p>“Who is it?” Zhou Wen asked patiently.</p>
<p>“Are you Zhou Wen?” the person at the door asked.</p>
<p>“I’m Zhou Wen. Who are you?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I’m just a nobody. If you’re happy, call me Nameless. I’m here to tell you that someone wants to harm you on your way to the Imperial Capital. You have to be careful,” the person outside said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss as he asked calmly, “Who wants to harm me?”</p>
<p>“It’s the Dugu family’s Dugu Ge and the Zhang family’s Zhang Chunqiu. You have to be careful of them.” The person outside said the exact same thing as the person who had just come.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“There’s no need for us to know each other. Let’s meet again if fate allows for it.” With that said, the person went downstairs.</p>
<h3 id='chapter729'>Chapter 729: Messy Information</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>What the hell is up with these people? They were all struck by lightning, but they still came running to tell me to be careful of a sneak attack? In this day and age, has the human mind reached such a sublime level? Zhou Wen doubted such good things existed.</p>
<p>The two of them shouldn’t be from the same faction. Otherwise, they would only need to come once. There’s no need for the two of them to run over. However, from the lightning wounds on their bodies, they seem to have experienced similar injuries. What’s going on? Zhou Wen thought about it and couldn’t figure it out.</p>
<p>If it were anyone else, they definitely wouldn’t be able to sleep after suffering such a disturbance.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen wasn’t someone who was afraid of trouble. He lay down before falling asleep again.</p>
<p>After Concerned Person and Nameless came, the thunderstorm became much smaller and gradually dissipated.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen woke up in the morning, the rain had already stopped. The television had also switched off by itself.</p>
<p>Could it be that it’s really because of the thunderstorm that the television was running on its own? Although Zhou Wen didn’t believe it, there was no better explanation.</p>
<p>The phone suddenly rang. Zhou Wen took out his phone and saw that it was An Sheng.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, are you in Weihui now?” An Sheng asked directly.</p>
<p>“Yes, how did you know?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“The bureau has already found your whereabouts. It might not be the best choice to make this trip,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“I have to make a trip to the Imperial Capital. Don’t worry, I’ll be careful.” Zhou Wen had no choice. If it was any other time, he would definitely have turned around and returned to Luoyang. At most, he wouldn’t go to the Imperial Capital.</p>
<p>But now that he had the log on him, if he didn’t go to the Imperial Capital and couldn’t separate from the log at all, how was he going to pass his days?</p>
<p>What was worse was that being inseparable from the log was only when he was resting. If Zhou Wen wanted to move, he had to carry it. Who could stand that?</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, if you insist on going, it’s best you change your route and progress speed. I’ve revised the routes for you.” An Sheng sent a document to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen chatted with An Sheng for a while before opening the document An Sheng had sent him. He wanted to know what to do next, but when he opened the document, his eyes widened.</p>
<p>The content of the document wasn’t a map at all, but a dynamic emoji. It was a picture of two tall and muscular men wearing only briefs. One of them had his arms around the other’s neck while the other was hugging his waist as they danced together.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately dumbfounded as his expression turned odd. It should have been sent wrongly… However, why would An Sheng have such a picture… Could it be…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shivered and hurriedly shook his head to deny his thoughts. He sent a message to An Sheng and asked, “Ah Sheng, did you send the wrong document?”</p>
<p>“Wasn’t it a map of the routes?” An Sheng quickly replied.</p>
<p>“No, it’s an animated picture.” Zhou Wen sent the picture along with the message.</p>
<p>After a while, An Sheng sent another message. “There’s something wrong with the message. I didn’t make a mistake, but the message you received isn’t right. The reason isn’t clear. It’s no longer safe to use my route. I’ll send you a few routes later. You shall choose the route yourself. Don’t tell anyone, including me.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>An Sheng sent a simple sketch over. It was obvious that it was hand drawn. It showed the routes from where he was to the Imperial Capital. He could choose one of them.</p>
<p>As the communication line could be compromised, An Sheng didn’t say much. He exhorted Zhou Wen to be careful before ending the call.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen studied the map before choosing a path to continue his journey.</p>
<p>In a cave on Chess Mountain, a seductive woman chained up was fiddling with some experimental equipment as though she was doing some research.</p>
<p>The phone beside her rang. The woman glanced at the phone screen and realized that the message was from Zhou Wen. With a thought, an invisible force immediately controlled the phone to tap open the message.</p>
<p>The phone automatically flew to the woman, allowing her to see the message.</p>
<p>The woman frowned.</p>
<p>“Baby, I want you to be my slave tonight…”</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you sure are gutsy! You want me to be your slave? I’ll satisfy you immediately.” The woman narrowed her eyes as a strange glint flashed in them.</p>
<p>With a thought, the woman automatically sent a message to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I’ll fulfill your wish tonight.”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was walking when he heard his phone ring. He took it out and saw that it was from The Thearch. He immediately clicked it open and was momentarily at a loss. He sent a message over.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? Did you send the wrong message?”</p>
<p>“Wrong message? Then who did you plan on sending your message to?” The Thearch quickly replied.</p>
<p>“How would I know who your message was meant for?” Zhou Wen felt even more puzzled.</p>
<p>The Thearch didn’t reply. Zhou Wen muttered to himself, “Crazy.”</p>
<p>After putting away his phone, he continued his journey. Zhou Wen changed his previous route and took another detour. He didn’t take the same old route.</p>
<p>Although taking the original path might have an unexpected effect, the probability of Zhou Wen changing his route and not changing his route was one in two. However, the chances of accurately determining which one of the new routes that Zhou Wen would take were much lower. Therefore, Zhou Wen decided to change his route.</p>
<p>An hour after Zhou Wen set off, Xia Liuchuan and company set off from another hotel in Weihui and continued following Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>They looked much better now. The day before, they had encountered the mysterious dimensional creature that nearly killed them. Although they had managed to escape in the end, they had suffered minor injuries.</p>
<p>With Zhang Chunqiu’s deduction, they slowly followed behind. They weren’t afraid of losing Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“We were really unlucky yesterday to encounter such a terrifying dimensional creature. Thankfully, I’m smart enough and ran fast enough,” Xia Liuchuan said gloomily.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu pondered and said, “I did some divinations when I came out today.”</p>
<p>“What do they say?” Xia Liuchuan asked.</p>
<p>“Today’s divination is still Sister Return Lightning Pool,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“No way! Something similar will happen today?” Xia Liuchuan frowned.</p>
<p>“I hope not. Logically speaking, this Sister Return Lightning Pool isn’t a bad divination, but this matter seems a little odd. It’s best to be careful,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>The trio left the city and followed Zhou Wen’s path for less than two hours before feeling that something was amiss. In the wilderness, there seemed to be pairs of eyes peeping at them, but upon careful inspection, they didn’t discover any dimensional creatures or humans.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me something is up again!” Xia Liuchuan felt uneasy.</p>
<h3 id='chapter730'>Chapter 730: Loving You for Ten Thousand Years</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“I’m afraid it’s already happened,” Zhang Chunqiu said as he sized up the dark forest.</p>
<p>Dugu Ge didn’t say a word, but many tiny worms flew into the forest.</p>
<p>Although the Gu worms weren’t at the Mythical stage, they had hidden techniques. Furthermore, they were small in size, making it difficult for ordinary creatures to discover them.</p>
<p>However, after the Gu worms entered the forest, they simultaneously lost contact with Dugu Ge. No matter how Dugu Ge summoned them, he couldn’t obtain their memories. This made Dugu Ge’s expression turn ugly.</p>
<p>“Quick, let’s go…” As Dugu Ge spoke, he spread open a pair of insect wings, wanting to retreat along his original path.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan also summoned his ancient sword to use Sword Kinesis Flight. His straight line speed wasn’t slower than Dugu Ge’s. Zhang Chunqiu wasn’t slow either. He took out a talisman and was about to escape underground.</p>
<p>However, just as the trio was halfway through their actions, they saw a pair of ghostly eyes open in the pitch-black forest. The eyes stared at them, and they felt their minds blur. They were so tired that they couldn’t even open their eyes.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The three of them fell to the ground in a daze. No matter how they struggled, their eyelids slowly closed.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen walked in front, all he felt was that the surrounding forest was especially quiet.</p>
<p>However, it was different from the path the antelope had taken him. Although this path was quiet, there were many animals. However, they seemed especially lazy and were still sleeping.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. He walked carefully, but he didn’t encounter any problems along the way. By the time he arrived at the next city, the sky had already darkened.</p>
<p>After a day of carrying the log, Zhou Wen felt exhausted. He found a hotel in the small city and settled down.</p>
<p>This small city was similar to the previous city. Almost everyone had left. Zhou Wen randomly found an empty hotel, and no one asked him for money.</p>
<p>That night, Zhou Wen slept very soundly. When he woke up, he stretched his back and was filled with energy.</p>
<p>Nothing strange happened that night, unlike the hotel the night before. The television didn’t automatically switch on.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. His chest seemed especially heavy. He looked down and immediately screamed.</p>
<p>For some reason, the clothes in front of his chest were lifted up as though there were two huge papayas stuffed inside. Zhou Wen hurriedly pulled open his clothes and immediately discovered two things that shouldn’t have appeared on him.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“How did this happen?” Zhou Wen realized that his voice had become extremely feminine. He hurriedly took out a mirror and looked at himself. He immediately realized that he had become a woman.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately thought of the message The Thearch had sent him. He hurriedly took out his phone and sent The Thearch a message. “The Thearch, did you turn me into a woman?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” The Thearch quickly replied and admitted it readily.</p>
<p>“Why? I haven’t offended you recently, right?” Zhou Wen held back his anger and asked.</p>
<p>“Don’t you know why?” The Thearch asked.</p>
<p>“I really don’t know. Tell me clearly, what’s the reason?” Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. From The Thearch’s tone, it seemed like he had provoked her first, but he hadn’t contacted The Thearch recently. The Thearch hadn’t contacted him either.</p>
<p>“Have you forgotten the message you sent so quickly? Do you still need me to remind you?” The Thearch replied.</p>
<p>“I really don’t know what’s going on. I’m begging you, alright? Tell me. What message did I send you?” Zhou Wen increasingly felt that there was definitely something wrong.</p>
<p>When The Thearch heard Zhou Wen’s words, she seemed to realize that something was amiss. With Zhou Wen’s character being so afraid of death, how could he tempt fate by sending such a teasing message?</p>
<p>The Thearch thought for a moment before sending a screenshot of the message to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Baby, I want you to be my slave tonight…” Zhou Wen’s head turned livid when he saw the screenshot.</p>
<p>He originally wanted to say that it wasn’t posted by himself, but looking at the chat history on the screenshot, it was indeed sent from his account.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder The Thearch is so angry. So that’s how it is. However, I’ve never sent such a message. If The Thearch wants to mess with me, there’s no need to go through so much trouble to send me a fake message. Could it be that my account has been hacked? Did someone send a message to The Thearch using my account? Zhou Wen was suspicious.</p>
<p>“The Thearch, I really didn’t send that message. How could I send you that message? Someone must have hacked my account and sent you that message.” Zhou Wen wanted to explain the matter clearly and get The Thearch to quickly transform his body back. He really had no way of going out to meet anyone.</p>
<p>“What do you mean it’s impossible for you to send me such a message?” The Thearch replied.</p>
<p>“You are a flower. How can I have any thoughts about a flower? The Thearch, just believe me. Even if I were to tease a sow, I wouldn’t dare tease you. Quickly change me back,” Zhou Wen explained.</p>
<p>It was fine if Zhou Wen didn’t give his explanations, but his explanations only served to make The Thearch even angrier. She replied coldly, “Just wait. You will recover on your own.”</p>
<p>Then, The Thearch didn’t reply to any more of Zhou Wen’s messages. Despite thinking hard, Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out what had gone wrong. She was fine just moments ago, so why was she suddenly unhappy?</p>
<p>Thankfully, recovery was still possible. It was probably similar to the last time he transformed into a cat. He would recover after some time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t leave. He planned on staying in the hotel and waiting for his transformation to end.</p>
<p>During this period of time, Zhou Wen restored his phone to its factory settings. Then, he redownloaded the apps and changed the password. He used all the available methods to prevent his account from being hacked again.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan was practicing his saber techniques as usual.</p>
<p>Suddenly, his phone rang. Feng Qiuyan usually didn’t pick up his phone or read messages when he was practicing with his saber. However, when he heard that the message was a ringtone that he had specially set, he guessed that it was from Zhou Wen. Feng Qiuyan stopped practicing with his saber and picked up his phone to take a look.</p>
<p>Indeed, the message was from Zhou Wen. Feng Qiuyan opened the message and his expression immediately turned odd.</p>
<p>“There was once a sincere love that was placed in front of me, but I didn’t cherish it. I only regretted it when I lost it. This is the most painful thing in the world. If the heavens can give me another chance, I will say three words to you: I love you. If you must add a deadline to this love, I hope it will be… ten thousand years!”</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan stared blankly at the message as he looked extremely confused.</p>
<p>How did this happen… Why would Coach treat me… How can I reject Coach without hurting his pride? Feng Qiuyan was conflicted.</p>
<h3 id='chapter731'>Chapter 731: Coach, You’re a Nice Guy</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Beep… Zhou Wen was grinding while sitting on the log when he suddenly heard his phone ring. He picked it up and realized that it was from Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>“Coach, you’re a nice guy. I believe you’ll meet the best person in the future. I just want to focus on practicing my saber. I don’t plan on considering personal problems. It’s not you, it’s me…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was confused, unsure of what was going on.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan was usually cool. Apart from practicing his saber techniques, he seldom spoke to others. Why would he suddenly send such a strange message to him? It didn’t seem like his style at all.</p>
<p>Could it be that he was hacked like me? As Zhou Wen thought about it, he sent Feng Qiuyan a message: “Little Yanyan, have you been hacked?”</p>
<p>When Feng Qiuyan received Zhou Wen’s message and saw the way he addressed him as Little Yanyan, he suddenly shivered for some reason.</p>
<p>This nickname was given to him by Li Xuan. He was used to being called that, so he didn’t feel anything. He didn’t mind it either.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, when he saw this nickname today, he found it a little strange. It weirded him out in an indescribable manner.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t hacked. Coach, we are still students. We should prioritize our studies. Besides, the Federation is in a dire situation now. Everyone has a responsibility for the Federation’s rise and fall…” Feng Qiuyan thought about how to reason with Zhou Wen without making him lose his dignity and not be sad about being rejected. He also hoped that it could be an impetus for him to work even harder.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss as he suddenly realized something. He immediately sent a message to Feng Qiuyan. “Before this message, did I send you a message? If there’s one, send me a screenshot.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a screenshot of the first message Feng Qiuyan had sent him and sent it over. He felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Indeed, it didn’t take long for Feng Qiuyan to send a screenshot over. He even added, “Coach, it’s really not that you aren’t good enough, but that I really just want to focus on practicing my saber.”</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw the screenshot, he wished he could immediately find a hole to burrow in.</p>
<p>F**k your sister. Who the hell is behind this? Zhou Wen felt like killing someone. If this continued, he would definitely go crazy.</p>
<p>Left with no choice, Zhou Wen sent a message to Feng Qiuyan to explain the theft of his account.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. I understand, Coach. I won’t tell anyone about this,” Feng Qiuyan replied.</p>
<p>“F**k that, what are you thinking? My account has really been hacked.” Zhou Wen felt like crying, but Feng Qiuyan’s words reminded him of something.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly sent a message to all his friends, telling them that his account had been hacked. If there were any abnormal messages from him, they mustn’t believe it.</p>
<p>Not long after, people replied to him with all sorts of messages. Some said that he had cheated them of their money and wanted them to return it. Others said that they had confessed to her and wanted him to take responsibility. However, they were all joking. Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief when he learned that the rest hadn’t received any special messages.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen switched off his phone before considering the matter. He felt that something was amiss, as though it wasn’t as simple as being hacked.</p>
<p>This seems to have happened after I entered the hotel which had the television automatically switched on. Could it be that something has happened to my phone? Zhou Wen felt that the two matters were related.</p>
<p>He checked his phone and didn’t find any problems. Everything inside was normal.</p>
<p>For this, Zhou Wen even especially found the internal structure of the phone and compared it to his own. However, there was nothing abnormal. No special components were installed inside.</p>
<p>After switching on the phone again, Zhou Wen wiped his phone again and restored its factory settings. He did it again, but he didn’t know if it was of any use.</p>
<p>That’s not right. Zhou Wen looked at the screen and suddenly discovered a problem.</p>
<p>The phone was normal, but the only abnormal thing was the battery.</p>
<p>In the past two days, Zhou Wen hadn’t charged his phone at all. Although he didn’t usually use the phone, it had been on standby for a few days. Furthermore, he had been using it for quite some time; yet, the battery was still at 100% charge. This was clearly abnormal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen discovered this anomaly and immediately thought of the television that had automatically switched on in the hotel.</p>
<p>I don’t know why there was an electric current in the television previously that allowed it to automatically switch on. Now, the battery in my phone doesn’t run out of charge. Could it be caused by the same thing? Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to check the phone’s battery, but he didn’t find any problems. He just found plenty of charge in the battery.</p>
<p>Although smashing the phone might resolve the problem, it was only a possibility. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and didn’t smash the phone. He switched it off.</p>
<p>Not long after, his body finally returned to normal. Zhou Wen continued on his journey with his phone.</p>
<p>On the way, Zhou Wen paid close attention to the phone. Truth Listener’s ability was constantly paying attention to the interior of the phone, especially the battery. However, he didn’t discover anything amiss.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the next city, Zhou Wen stopped to rest again. His phone remained silent.</p>
<p>However, in the middle of the night, something abnormal happened. The phone that had been switched off, automatically switched on.</p>
<p>When the phone was switched on, an app automatically started playing the old movie. Zhou Wen had already seen this old movie in the hotel.</p>
<p>The problem is indeed there. Zhou Wen was now certain that something had happened at the hotel in the thunderstorm.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen switched off his phone again, but not long after, the phone automatically switched on again. It was still playing the old movies. Furthermore, no matter how long it played them, the phone’s battery didn’t decrease.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen switched it off a few times, but his phone would automatically switch on. Therefore, he decided not to turn it off.</p>
<p>Nothing happened to the phone until the morning.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen observed the battery in his phone the entire night. He could sense that there was a fluctuation in the battery, and it was extremely abnormal.</p>
<p>Could it be that the electric current is a special dimensional creature? Zhou Wen felt that the possibility was very high.</p>
<p>If the electric current inside was a Companion Beast, no one would use a Companion Beast like this. Although it created some trouble for him, it wasn’t fatal.</p>
<p>If his enemy had such a Companion Beast, they wouldn’t have used it in such a manner. It could definitely deal him a lethal blow and throw him into eternal damnation.</p>
<p>How can I get the electric current out? Zhou Wen looked at his phone and thought about how to confirm if there was a dimensional creature inside.</p>
<h3 id='chapter732'>Chapter 732: Disappeared</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Smash my phone? It’s probably not of much use. It could silently run from the television into my phone, so it should be able to move elsewhere. That would make it even harder to find it. Now that it’s in my phone, at least I know where it is, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>What kind of dimensional creature is this? A pure electric creature? Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to monitor it and could only sense electric waves. He couldn’t tell anything else.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought about it carefully. The electric-elemental creatures he had heard of in the past had powerful destructive powers. They were especially ferocious when it came to roasting meat.</p>
<p>However, this was the first time Zhou Wen had seen an electric-type creature that could enter electronic products, control electronic products, and use his software to send messages. He had never even heard of it before, much less seen it.</p>
<p>If it was a traditional electric-type creature, Zhou Wen could blast it apart even if it was at the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>However, such a sneaky fellow was not easy to deal with.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss for a good solution. He wanted to use his phone to contact The Thearch to ask if she knew the origins of this strange electric-type creature, but he was afraid that the information would be tampered with. He didn’t know what trouble it would cause.</p>
<p>After daybreak, Zhou Wen carried the wooden log to the phone shop. There were very few people in the small city. After circling the city for some time, he finally found a phone shop and bought a few new phones and a new SIM card.</p>
<p>After returning to the hotel, Zhou Wen placed the new phones in front of him and used Truth Listener to monitor the internal electric current in them.</p>
<p>Only his first phone had a strange electric current fluctuation. Zhou Wen left it on the table and took out a new phone. He went to the yard outside and called The Thearch.</p>
<p>Thankfully, The Thearch didn’t reject the call because it was an unknown number. Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief and recounted what he had encountered in detail.</p>
<p>“To think I’ve never seen such a dimensional creature before.” The Thearch actually didn’t know the origins of this dimensional creature.</p>
<p>After pausing for a moment, The Thearch continued, “However, from your description, it should have an electromagnetic attribute. It might even have a magnetic field ability. It’s probably impossible to destroy it by simply destroying the phone. It can easily transfer elsewhere.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I think too. I just can’t think of a good way to deal with it,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>The Thearch curled her lips and said, “Were your studies for nothing? Waves need to be transmitted through matter, and particles will be affected by a force field. Even if it’s formed from pure electric energy, it can’t break these laws. Why don’t you try using the power similar to a black hole created by Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately taken aback. He had been considering how to restrain the electric-type creatures that existed in myths and legends. He never expected that a dimensional creature like The Thearch would take to him using human scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>“How do you know that Tyrant Behemoth is mine?” Zhou Wen suddenly reacted. He hadn’t told The Thearch that Tyrant Behemoth belonged to him.</p>
<p>“What do I not know?” The Thearch said disdainfully.</p>
<p>After hanging up, Zhou Wen returned to his room. Just as he was about to test if Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength was effective, he suddenly realized that the special electric current in his phone had vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully checked the other phones and checked everything in the hotel that could be connected to electricity. He didn’t discover any abnormal electric waves.</p>
<p>Why is it gone now? Zhou Wen pondered for a moment and thought of a possibility.</p>
<p>It was very likely that the strange electric creature had overheard his conversation with The Thearch and had escaped.</p>
<p>Unwilling to give up, he searched the entire night without discovering any problems. In the day, Zhou Wen had no choice but to set off.</p>
<p>After this, nothing abnormal happened on the phone. Everything returned to normal.</p>
<p>Has that electric-type creature really escaped? Zhou Wen found it unbelievable that such a strange and cunning dimensional creature would be frightened away by a few words.</p>
<p>Not long after Zhou Wen left, three men entered the small city where he had stayed. The three of them looked haggard and they had dark eye circles. They looked like they had stayed up all night for a week and were about to die.</p>
<p>These three people were naturally Xia Liuchuan, Zhang Chunqiu, and Dugu Ge.</p>
<p>“Don’t you think that there’s something wrong with this matter? The first time we encountered that terrifying electric beast, we were nearly electrocuted to death. The second time, we encountered a Nightmare and almost lost ourselves in a dreamland forever. Why did we encounter such powerful Mythical creatures?” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>Dugu Ge said with certainty, “It’s definitely not a coincidence.”</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu pondered for a moment and said, “I think this matter might have something to do with Zhou Wen. Wherever he goes, nothing happens. But he leaves a wake of problems behind him.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying that Zhou Wen is secretly up to no good and wants to harm us?” Xia Liuchuan frowned.</p>
<p>“That’s not it. He probably doesn’t know that we are here. After all, it was a coincidence that we met him previously,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“Then what do you mean?” Xia Liuchuan looked at Zhang Chunqiu in confusion.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu pondered for a moment and said, “Did you notice that there’s something wrong with the piece of wood Zhou Wen has been carrying?”</p>
<p>“Of course there’s a problem. I’ve never seen such a block of wood before. It looks a little like a Gloomy Wood, but it looks even more solid than the Gloomy Wood,” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>“No, I’m not talking about that.” Zhang Chunqiu reorganized his thoughts before saying, “Do you feel that the log is a little sinister?”</p>
<p>“Sinister?” Xia Liuchuan and Dugu Ge exchanged looks, puzzled.</p>
<p>Seeing that they were silent, Zhang Chunqiu guessed that they had not noticed it before. He continued, “I think there’s something wrong with that piece of wood. It seems a little sinister. It doesn’t feel like a simple log.”</p>
<p>“If it doesn’t look like a log, what does it look like?” Xia Liuchuan asked in confusion.</p>
<p>“How should I put it? Nowadays, we carry out cremation or promession. In ancient times, land burials were popular. It used a wooden coffin to store a person’s corpse before burying it in the ground. Although that piece of wood looks different from a coffin, the sinister aura emitted from it makes me think of a coffin.” Zhang Chunqiu shared his feelings.</p>
<p>“A coffin? Are you saying that there might be a dead person’s corpse in that piece of wood? Zhou Wen is traveling with a dead person’s corpse on his back? Why is he carrying that thing?” Xia Liuchuan widened his eyes.</p>
<h3 id='chapter733'>Chapter 733: Sister Return Lightning Pool Again</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“I’m only saying that the piece of wood gives me the feeling of a coffin, but I didn’t say that it’s definitely it. Perhaps it’s not. Even if it’s real, there might not be a corpse inside. Even if there’s a corpse, it might not be a human corpse,” Zhang Chunqiu said as he beat around the bush.</p>
<p>“Then isn’t it as good as not saying anything? Are we still following?” Xia Liuchuan asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. This concerns the Guardian’s ownership. It doesn’t matter if you follow or not, but I have to see the outcome with my own eyes,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“In that case, what are we waiting for? Let’s go,” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>The three of them set off again, but this time, they deliberately lagged far behind, trying to keep a greater distance from Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, after walking for a while, they felt that something was amiss. The surrounding fields seemed to be filled with a cold wind that made their hearts tremble.</p>
<p>“Old Zhang, why do I feel that something is amiss? Try divining again,” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>As he said, Zhang Chunqiu did another divination before his expression turned odd.</p>
<p>Seeing his expression, Xia Liuchuan and Dugu Ge knew that the situation wasn’t good. They hurriedly asked, “What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“The divination is still Sister Return Lightning Pool,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan and Dugu Ge’s expressions changed as well. During the first Sister Return Lightning Pool, they had encountered an electric beast. They met a Nightmare the second time. Now, they were encountering it again.</p>
<p>“Is this sister never getting married?” Xia Liuchuan said gloomily.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan’s words suddenly gave Zhang Chunqiu a flash of inspiration. He said in surprise, “Do you think that the divination of Sister Return Lightning Pool refers to that piece of wood?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Xia Liuchuan and Dugu Ge didn’t understand.</p>
<p>“If my previous guess wasn’t wrong, that piece of wood is really something like a coffin. Do you think there’s a woman inside?” Zhang Chunqiu said in a bold and unconstrained manner.</p>
<p>“What woman? If it’s really a coffin, there should be a female corpse inside,” Xia Liuchuan corrected.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s a woman or a female corpse. Over the past few days, no matter how I divine, the results are always Sister Return Lightning Pool. I think this matter definitely has something to do with that piece of wood.” The more Zhang Chunqiu spoke, the more convinced he was.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan was about to say something when he suddenly heard a roar. The fields beside them split open and a huge earth dragon crawled out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked ahead. Although he felt that the atmosphere was somewhat odd his entire journey, he didn’t encounter any other strange things other than the electric-type dimensional creature.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was in no mood to visit other dimensional zones. He walked whenever he could and rested when exhausted. He kept rushing towards the Imperial Capital, hoping to rid the crappy piece of wood from him as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen himself was fine, but Xia Liuchuan and company, who were following behind him, suffered. They experienced all sorts of difficulties along the way, almost losing their lives several times.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan ultimately couldn’t take it anymore and decided to take a detour back to the Xia family in the Imperial Capital.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu decided to continue, but Brother Dugu didn’t plan on following.</p>
<p>“Young Master, everyone is here. When are we going to take action?” The members of the Dugu family came in front of Dugu Ge and bowed.</p>
<p>“Abort the plan for now,” Dugu Ge said.</p>
<p>Everyone was taken aback. One of them asked in puzzlement, “Young Master, why are you aborting it? This concerns your contractual with a Guardian.”</p>
<p>“It’s a long story. I’ll explain this matter to the elders in the clan. Just do as I say,” Dugu Ge said.</p>
<p>“Yes.” The group had just arrived and didn’t even get to rest. All they could do was turn back.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan rushed back to the Xia family. He wasn’t really afraid that he would encounter danger if he followed behind, but he had already received the news that the Xia family was prepared to attack Zhou Wen before he entered the capital. Xia Liuchuan wanted to rush back and convince Xia Dongyue to give up on this operation.</p>
<p>The wooden log Zhou Wen was carrying was indeed odd. Xia Liuchuan was afraid that the Xia family would end up dying as a result.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan embarked on his journey with light gear. He chose the shortest path and returned to the capital much earlier than Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Liuchuan, why are you back? Didn’t I tell you to follow Zhou Wen?” Xia Dongyue couldn’t help but frown when he saw Xia Liuchuan.</p>
<p>“Uncle Yue, can we abort this operation?” Xia Liuchuan was in a hurry to rush back because he might not be able to convince Xia Dongyue over the phone.</p>
<p>“Why should we abort it?” Xia Dongyue asked Xia Liuchuan.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen is carrying a strange piece of wood to the Imperial Capital. That piece of wood has a strange background and is very sinister. I’m afraid something will happen if we touch him now,” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>“A piece of wood?” Xia Dongyue was a little puzzled. Xia Liuchuan had always been fearless, so how could a piece of wood make him so cautious? This was completely different from the Xia Liuchuan that Xia Dongyue knew.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan recounted what had happened when the three of them followed Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Zhang Chunqiu guessed that the terrifying Mythical creatures we encountered along the way are related to that piece of wood. I think it’s very likely,” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>“It sounds reasonable, but even so, it doesn’t mean that we can’t touch Zhou Wen. We can choose to carry out the operation near the capital. The dimensional zones there are under our control. We don’t have to worry about any break-out creatures causing trouble,” Xia Dongyue said after some thought.</p>
<p>“Uncle Yue, why take such a risk? The grudge between Zhou Wen and the bureau is known by the entire Federation. It’s highly likely that he came to the capital this time for the bureau. Why should we be used by the bureau?” Xia Liuchuan continued with his persuasion.</p>
<p>Xia Dongyue shook his head and said, “This is Old Master’s idea. You know his temper. No one can change what he has decided.”</p>
<p>When Xia Liuchuan heard the words “Old Master,” his heart sank. He knew that this operation was already a foregone conclusion and could not be changed.</p>
<p>“Liuchuan, you don’t have to worry too much. Although that piece of wood might be a little strange, with our Xia family’s heritage, there’s no need to worry about it. It’s just Zhou Wen. Taking him down isn’t difficult.” Xia Dongyue patted Xia Liuchuan on the shoulder and said, “Since you’re back, stay home and get some rest. I’ll get someone from the East Courtyard to handle this matter.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“I hope so.” Xia Liuchuan felt that this matter wouldn’t succeed so easily, but there was nothing he could do.</p>
<p>The Old Master of the Xia family was the supreme existence in the Xia family. Even Xia Dongyue, who had become a member of the Senate, didn’t dare disobey his words. No one could change his mind.</p>
<h3 id='chapter734'>Chapter 734: Erected on the Peak of the Forbidden City</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Although Xia Liuchuan was a little worried, he had no choice but to leave Xia Dongyue’s office.</p>
<p>“Brother, you seem to have something on your mind. Is it because you didn’t obtain the Guardian cocoon?” Xia Xuanyue asked with concern when she saw Xia Liuchuan frowning.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen is on his way to the Imperial Capital. Old Master has already ordered the people from the East Courtyard to bring him back before he enters the Imperial Capital,” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>“Why is Old Master taking Zhou Wen into custody?” Having not heard of this, Xia Xuanyue’s expression changed slightly when she learned of it.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan hurriedly stopped Xia Xuanyue from continuing. He looked around and seeing that no one was passing by, he said softly, “You should be the only person to know about this. Don’t mention it again, and don’t tell anyone. Also, don’t ask too much about the Old Master. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>“Why?” Xia Xuanyue was still confused.</p>
<p>In fact, Xia Xuanyue’s impression of the Old Master was very vague. Although the Old Master was the true head of the Xia family, Xia Xuanyue had only seen him a handful of times despite having grown up in the Xia family.</p>
<p>In her impression, the Old Master was a stern old man in a white robe. He occasionally appeared at important Xia family ceremonies. He usually lived in the East Courtyard.</p>
<p>The East Courtyard was also a restricted area in the Xia family. Without the Old Master’s summoning, even Xia Dongyue couldn’t enter and leave the East Courtyard freely.</p>
<p>Only those who were in charge of taking care of the Old Master’s daily needs could enter the East Courtyard.</p>
<p>Most of the people who were in charge of taking care of the Old Master’s daily needs were not from the Xia family. However, they were all loyal to the Old Master and wouldn’t hesitate or doubt his orders.</p>
<p>When Xia Xuanyue was young, she had seen an elder of the Xia family who was seized by the people from the East Courtyard for some unknown crime. After entering the East Courtyard, he never came out again.</p>
<p>“Don’t ask why. Trust me. I’m your brother. I won’t harm you,” Xia Liuchuan said as he looked into Xia Xuanyue’s eyes.</p>
<p>“I understand.” Xia Xuanyue nodded slightly.</p>
<p>“Get some rest. Since this matter has already been handed over to the East Courtyard, we don’t have to bother about it anymore.” Xia Liuchuan seemed to have something on his mind. After saying that, he returned to his residence.</p>
<p>However, before he could open the door, someone sent a message saying that the Old Master wanted to see him.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan’s heart quaked. He had already guessed why the Old Master was looking for him.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan took a deep breath and followed the butler to the East Courtyard.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t necessary, Xia Liuchuan would rather not enter the East District ever again.</p>
<p>When he was young, he had actually liked visiting the East Courtyard. The Old Master doted on him very much. The other members of the Xia family were not allowed to enter the East Courtyard, but he was specially permitted by the Old Master to enter freely.</p>
<p>At that time, Xia Liuchuan could be said to be able to get whatever he wanted. Even if he plucked the flowers personally planted by the Old Master, the Old Master would only laugh and never punish him.</p>
<p>However, after he turned fifteen, Xia Liuchuan seldom went to the East Courtyard. Although he still had the privilege of doing so, he was unwilling to go again.</p>
<p>As he stepped into the familiar garden and saw the familiar decorations and flowers, Xia Liuchuan had mixed feelings.</p>
<p>“Little Chuan, Dongyue has already told me about your matters. Don’t worry, I’ll let Zhou Wen enter the Imperial Capital alive. I’ll let you win the bet and obtain the chance to contract the guardian.” A white-robed elder sat in a stone pavilion with a pond by its side, feeding the carp in it.</p>
<p>“Sorry to trouble you.” Xia Liuchuan bowed slightly.</p>
<p>He was a fearless person who dared to do anything, but in front of this Old Master, he didn’t dare to do anything rash.</p>
<p>As the elder fed the fish, he continued, “It’s nothing much. It’s just a matter of time. After you contract the Guardian, I want you to personally bring Zhou Wen back to me. Can you do it?”</p>
<p>“Old Master, everyone around you is stronger than me. Why must I go?” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>“If you aren’t willing, let Xuanyue go,” the elder said indifferently.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan gapped his mouth as though he wanted to say something, but he didn’t say anything in the end. He only nodded. “Got it. I’ll bring Zhou Wen back.”</p>
<p>“Remember, you are the future master of the Xia family. No matter how strong the people under you are, they are ultimately servants,” the elder said.</p>
<p>“I understand,” Xia Liuchuan lowered his head and said.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen rushed all the way to the Imperial Capital and didn’t encounter anything strange. Apart from the fact that the log was especially heavy and making it difficult for him to go any faster, there wasn’t much trouble.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw the two words—Imperial Capital—from afar, he couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“Ol’ Ante, where should I place this log when I reach the Imperial Capital?” Zhou Wen asked the antelope.</p>
<p>The antelope wrote on the ground with its hooves, “Erect it on the peak of the Forbidden City.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw the words written by the antelope and immediately widened his eyes.</p>
<p>The Imperial Capital’s Forbidden City was now a very special dimensional zone. It was also one of the dimensional zones that the Xia family valued the most. Its importance was no less than that of the Ancient Sword Tomb.</p>
<p>According to what Zhou Wen knew, ever since the dimensional storms, the Xia family had sealed off the Forbidden City dimensional zone, preventing anyone from approaching.</p>
<p>If he wanted to enter, it shouldn’t be difficult for him to do so with the Invisibility Cloak’s ability.</p>
<p>However, it was impossible for him to enter the city without anyone noticing while carrying such a huge object. He had to clash with the Xia family.</p>
<p>“Ol’ Ante, are you deliberately setting me up?” Zhou Wen seriously suspected that the antelope had deliberately set him up because he had forcefully dragged it out to come with him on this trip.</p>
<p>The antelope ignored him and stepped across the Imperial Capital’s Boundary Stone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had to follow. He had no other choice at this point in time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen seldom went out, so he had never seen a city as big as the Imperial Capital. Compared to it, Luoyang appeared rather small in scale and numbers.</p>
<p>As there were too many people, Zhou Wen didn’t ride the Great Might Vajra Bull. He walked forward while carrying the wooden log.</p>
<p>Although this was the Imperial Capital, people still gawked when they saw Zhou Wen walking on the streets with such a huge block of wood.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally planned on contacting Wang Lu when he arrived in the Imperial Capital. However, it wasn’t appropriate for him to treat her to a meal while carrying a huge log. Therefore, he decided not to contact her. It wouldn’t be too late to contact her after resolving the matter with the log.</p>
<p>He found a hotel and checked in. The room was rather expensive, but Zhou Wen still paid for it without any hesitation. Furthermore, he booked the room for a week.</p>
<p>This place was relatively close to Forbidden City. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows in the room, one could see the distant Forbidden City. This was also why Zhou Wen chose to stay here.</p>
<p>How can I sneak this log in? Zhou Wen stood in front of the window and stared at the ancient Forbidden City in the distance as many thoughts flashed through his mind.</p>
<h3 id='chapter735'>Chapter 735: Creditor Comes Knocking</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Ever since he entered the Imperial Capital, Zhou Wen felt all sorts of gazes staring at him. Furthermore, there were definitely more than one or two people staring at him.</p>
<p>It was almost impossible to enter the Forbidden City without anyone noticing.</p>
<p>Do I have to barge my way in? Zhou Wen was somewhat hesitant.</p>
<p>Although his present strength could be considered top-notch in the Federation and he had many Mythical Companion Beasts, he probably wouldn’t be able to gain an advantage against a hero family.</p>
<p>After all, they had been operating for decades. Even if they didn’t have a phone to grind for resources, they definitely had a lot of resources in real life.</p>
<p>What puzzled Zhou Wen was that despite a large number of spies staring at him, no one attacked him despite him being in the capital for so long.</p>
<p>When did the bureau become so good-tempered? They actually haven’t come looking for trouble? Zhou Wen felt that there was something amiss.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was right. Something had happened on the way.</p>
<p>However, due to an accident, the Dugu family, who had originally planned to attack him, aborted the operation. The bureau was waiting for the Xia family to take action, and because the Xia family wanted Xia Liuchuan to win the bet, they allowed him to arrive at the Imperial Capital safely.</p>
<p>Now that the Xia family was waiting for Xia Liuchuan to sign a contract with the Guardian, everything was calm.</p>
<p>As he was thinking, he felt a fluctuation from a Companion Beast. Explosive Fiend Man that had evolved again had finally completed its evolution.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen checked Explosive Fiend Man’s stats in-game.</p>
<p>Explosive Fiend Man: Epic (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Unlawful</p>
<p>Life Soul: Destroyer</p>
<p>Strength: 41</p>
<p>Speed: 41</p>
<p>Constitution: 41</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 41</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Death List, Time-Blast</p>
<p>Companion Form: Self-detonation Device</p>
<p>His stats had risen in a normal fashion. His skills hadn’t changed, but he had gained a Life Soul.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned Explosive Fiend Man in-game. It didn’t look much different from when it was at the Legendary stage. It looked like a very modern armored soldier.</p>
<p>Let me see what use your Life Soul has. Zhou Wen got Explosive Fiend Man to use the Destroyer Life Soul.</p>
<p>With a thought, the red liquid in the glass tubes on Explosive Fiend Man’s back injected into his body through the pipes. Then, Zhou Wen saw Explosive Fiend Man’s armor emitting strange red flames. Its body was filled with a dangerous aura.</p>
<p>Explosive Fiend Man seemed to have been injected with stimulants. His Speed and Strength had greatly increased, and his skills had also been strengthened.</p>
<p>Previously, he needed at least thirty seconds to complete a Time-Blast. However, with the augmentation of the Destroyer Life Soul, he only used less than three seconds to complete a Time-Blast. His efficiency had increased by ten times.</p>
<p>This Destroyer Life Soul is quite strong! Zhou Wen was overjoyed. In the past, Explosive Fiend Man’s skill cast time was too slow, so it wasn’t convenient to use it.</p>
<p>Although the speed of a skill at three seconds was still a little slow, much slower than an instantaneous skill, considering Explosive Fiend Man’s special skill, three seconds was considered rather powerful.</p>
<p>I can consider using Explosive Fiend Man to set up some time bombs nearby. If anyone tries to sneak up on me, I’ll make sure they have no chance of returning. Zhou Wen only had this thought. After all, this was a hotel. It wouldn’t be good if he injured the workers who were cleaning up the room.</p>
<p>If Explosive Fiend Man advances to the Mythical stage, I might be able to instantly release a time bomb. That would be awesome. Zhou Wen looked forward to Explosive Fiend Man’s growth.</p>
<p>The doorbell rang. Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to take a look and was immediately stunned. The person standing outside the door was Wang Lu.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly opened the door. When Wang Lu saw him, she said unhappily, “You didn’t inform me, your debtor, despite coming to the Imperial Capital? Are you trying to renege on your debt?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I encountered some trouble. I originally planned on contacting you after resolving it, but I never expected you to come here yourself. By the way, how did you know that I was in the Imperial Capital?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“What’s so strange about that? After all, our Wang family has some influence in the Imperial Capital. For a famous person like you to come to the Imperial Capital, I have no choice but to know. This news keeps buzzing around my ears. It’s so irritating that I can’t sleep,” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>“As you know, I’m in a lot of trouble now. I don’t have the time to eat with you for the time being. Go back now and I’ll look for you when I’m done with my matters,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen mainly didn’t want his matter to implicate Wang Lu, but when Wang Lu heard that, she curled her lips and said, “If you want to renege on your debt, just say so. Why do you have to come up with so many excuses? Since I came looking for you, I’m naturally not afraid of trouble. Why are you being so wishy-washy? Don’t tell me you don’t even have time to go downstairs to eat?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that I don’t have time, but it’s really inconvenient.” Zhou Wen pointed at the wooden log under his buttocks and said, “I have to carry this with me at all times. Where do you think I can eat conveniently when I have to take it with me?”</p>
<p>“What’s this? Why are you carrying it? Just leave it in the room. If you find it unsafe, I’ll get someone to look after it for you,” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>“It’s not about safety. I can’t leave it. I have to carry it with me. It’s a long story,” Zhou Wen said helplessly.</p>
<p>Wang Lu thought for a moment and said, “It doesn’t matter. Just take it with you and follow me. I’ll find a place. It’s very quiet there. That place can easily accommodate a few more logs of the same size.”</p>
<p>“That’s not very nice, right? You know that my relationship with the bureau isn’t good. This is where the headquarters of the bureau is…” Zhou Wen really didn’t wish for Wang Lu to be embroiled in his matters.</p>
<p>“Cut the crap. I don’t like hearing that. Just follow me.” Having known him for so long, Wang Lu knew Zhou Wen’s temper quite well. There was no need to waste her breath on him. All she needed to do was drag him away.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid it will affect your family.” Zhou Wen had no choice but to make things clear.</p>
<p>“I’ve already said it. Since I dared to come, I’m naturally not afraid. Although the bureau is very powerful, they can’t do anything to me. Don’t worry. Quickly follow me. I didn’t eat anything the entire morning just to eat this meal of yours. I’m starving,” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>The chick smartly flew onto Wang Lu’s shoulder. Even the antelope took the initiative to approach her and fawned over her. Zhou Wen had no choice but to carry the wooden log and follow Wang Lu.</p>
<p>Looking at Wang Lu teasing the chick in front of him, Zhou Wen’s mood improved significantly. Under such circumstances, it was indeed rare for Wang Lu to be willing to seek him out. Typical schoolmates would probably keep their distance from him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that Wang Lu was taking him to a restaurant, but to his surprise, Wang Lu brought him all the way to a traditionally-styled ancient building complex.</p>
<p>After circling the alley for a while, he entered one of the ancient buildings’ courtyard.</p>
<h3 id='chapter736'>Chapter 736: The Geniuses’ Accidents</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>After entering the yard, Wang Lu’s expression turned solemn. “Do you know that you are in grave danger now?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded. “I know.”</p>
<p>“Why are you still here when you know? Do you feel uncomfortable if you don’t get beaten up for a day?” Wang Lu rolled her eyes at him.</p>
<p>“I didn’t plan on coming here like this.” Zhou Wen originally planned on using the Invisibility Cloak to enter the Imperial Capital, preventing others from knowing that he had been here.</p>
<p>But now, he was carrying a huge log. It was useless even if he was invisible. The Invisibility Cloak couldn’t cover such a huge log. Anyone would know that something was amiss when they saw a log floating in midair.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid you still don’t know the current situation. If it was just the bureau finding trouble with you, that would be fine. With your abilities and me acting as your informant, it shouldn’t be difficult to deal with it. However, the person who wants to touch you isn’t just the bureau. There’s also the real master of the capital, the Xia family. It’s easy for you to come to the Imperial Capital, but I’m afraid it won’t be easy for you to leave,” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>“Why does the Xia family want to deal with me?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>He didn’t have any deep feud with the Xia family, so there was no reason for them to kill him, right?</p>
<p>“The intricacies are very complicated. I’ll get my grandmother to tell you later.” As Wang Lu spoke, she walked towards the main room.</p>
<p>“Grandma, I’ve brought a friend,” Wang Lu shouted into the hall as she walked.</p>
<p>“Crazy girl, just come. What are you shouting for?” A voice came from the backyard and an old woman walked over.</p>
<p>The woman looked quite old. Her hair was already white, but for some reason, there weren’t any wrinkles on her face. She looked very elegant, and it was easy to guess that she must have been a beauty when she was young.</p>
<p>“This lad is the Zhou Wen you often mention, right?” the old woman said as she sized him up.</p>
<p>“When did I? It’s just that he owes me so much and hasn’t paid me back that I occasionally mention him. I’m afraid that I’ll forget the debt,” Wang Lu said as she tugged the old woman’s arm.</p>
<p>“I see.” The old woman smiled at Zhou Wen and said, “Lad, you look so young. Why did you get yourself in debt? Furthermore, your debtor is a female student. Don’t tell me you want to be a freeloader?”</p>
<p>“Grandma Wang, it’s not like that.” Zhou Wen wanted to explain.</p>
<p>However, before he could finish his sentence, he was interrupted by the old woman. “But it doesn’t matter. Our Wang family doesn’t have much of anything else, but we have plenty of money. There’s no way to spend it all eating. Just treat it as doing a good deed and come often to have a bite. It doesn’t matter if you stay here. Our Wang family happens to be lacking a live-in son-in-law…”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Grandma, what are you talking about?” Wang Lu’s face flushed red. “Zhou Wen is only my classmate. It’s not what you think.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Wang Lu added, “Grandma, you must already know about Zhou Wen’s situation. Tell him how dangerous his current situation is.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing Wang Lu’s words, Grandma Wang retracted her smile. “Let’s talk inside.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed them into the hall. Wang Lu gestured for him to sit down before she brewed tea for them all.</p>
<p>“Grandma Wang, I heard from Wang Lu that the Xia family wants to find trouble with me, but I don’t have much of a grudge with the Xia family. Why are they targeting me?” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>Grandma Wang nodded and said, “The crazy girl is right. The Xia family might really attack you. You shouldn’t have come to the Imperial Capital.”</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, Grandma Wang continued, “The crazy girl is willing to bring you here because she doesn’t treat you as an outsider. So I won’t say things meant for outsiders. What I’m about to say next is just speculation. It’s not necessarily the truth. So don’t take it too seriously.”</p>
<p>“Grandma Wang, don’t worry. I’m not a talkative person,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“It’s fine even if you are talkative. Anyway, I won’t admit to what I said today, nor will the Wang family.” Grandma Wang said with a smile, “According to my guess, the reason the Xia family is targeting you isn’t because your teacher was Wang Mingyuan, nor is it because you crippled the Xia family’s juniors’ Essence Energy sea in the Holy Land.”</p>
<p>“Then what’s the reason?” Apart from these two reasons, Zhou Wen really couldn’t figure out what connection he had with the Xia family.</p>
<p>Although Demonic Neonate’s demonic sword was snatched from Xia Xuanyue, Xia Xuanyue herself didn’t know that it was done by Demonic Neonate. The Xia family shouldn’t pin the blame on him.</p>
<p>Grandma Wang said with a strange expression, “If there’s a reason, there’s only one. You are too talented.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He found it difficult to believe that the Xia family wanted to kill him just for this reason.</p>
<p>There were many talented youths nowadays, and he wasn’t the only one. Even if the Xia family were to suppress the other wealthy families, it shouldn’t have to resort to such means.</p>
<p>After all, the dimensional zones’ seals weren’t stable. The six families alone probably wouldn’t be able to withstand the dimensional army. To suppress the local factions would only make them appear short-sighted.</p>
<p>As if she had seen through Zhou Wen’s thoughts, Grandma Wang continued, “In the past, there were precedents of geniuses disappearing or encountering accidents in the Federation. Furthermore, there has been more than one incident. Similar incidents happened every once in a while. It’s fine if it’s just ordinary geniuses, but most of these geniuses are targets that the various families focused on grooming. With the protection of the various families, it’s almost impossible for them to take such a huge risk. Yet, something happened to them.”</p>
<p>“In Luoyang, you should know that there’s a Li family in Luoyang. The Li family once had a talented youth. His talent wasn’t inferior to the current Overseer An, but before he truly grew in strength, he died because of some problem,” said Grandma Wang with a sigh.</p>
<p>“You mean that the disappearance of these geniuses has something to do with the Xia family?” Zhou Wen had already heard Li Xuan mention the matter regarding his elder brother’s demise.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan had learned about it from Li Mobai. He never expected Grandma Wang to know about it.</p>
<p>Grandma Wang declined to comment and continued, “In the past, our Wang family also had such a genius. Similarly, he died because of some matters. That matter looked like an accident, but I didn’t think it was that simple. Therefore, I secretly did investigations, but I didn’t manage to find anything. However, during this period of time, I discovered something. The accidents of those young geniuses seemed to have something to do with the Xia family.”</p>
<p>“Is the Xia family resorting to every means possible, to the point of attacking their competitors, just to consolidate their forces?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“This is also what I found strange back then. The Xia family didn’t target their opponents who had conflicts of interest with them. They seemed to be only interested in those outstanding geniuses and didn’t differentiate between friend and foe. Therefore, when I investigated in the beginning, I was also confused and didn’t think about the Xia family. Later, after investigating for a long time, I realized that it appeared to be the Xia family behind this matter,” Grandma Wang said.</p>
<h3 id='chapter737'>Chapter 737: Where Is the Highest Spot?</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>After Zhou Wen left the yard, he kept thinking about what Grandma Wang had said.</p>
<p>Although there was no evidence that the Xia family was related to the geniuses’ demise, Zhou Wen also felt that there was something amiss.</p>
<p>It didn’t seem right to explain it away as the Xia family deliberately suppressing ordinary families as a way to strengthen their status.</p>
<p>According to Grandma Wang’s investigations, some of the young geniuses who had gotten into trouble didn’t belong to the East District, much less the Xia family’s circle of influence.</p>
<p>The situation in the other regions was chaotic. It was a happy outcome for the Xia family, but they clearly didn’t think so.</p>
<p>Regardless, I have to think of a way to get this crappy piece of wood into the Forbidden City. Otherwise, it won’t be convenient for me to do anything. When Zhou Wen was with the Wang family, he had also asked some questions regarding Forbidden City.</p>
<p>Wang Lu and Grandma Wang didn’t know much about Forbidden City. This was because the Xia family had occupied it from the beginning of the dimensional storms. They never allowed outsiders to enter, so no one knew what had happened inside after the dimensional storms.</p>
<p>However, Grandma Wang told Zhou Wen something very interesting. She had lived through the dimensional storms, so she had entered Forbidden City quite often before they occurred.</p>
<p>She said that she had once visited the Forbidden City when she was young. Back then, the weather suddenly turned bad and thunder rumbled in the sky.</p>
<p>She originally wanted to return home quickly, but when she passed a certain spot in the city, she suddenly saw some strange shadows.</p>
<p>The shadows wore ancient clothes as they walked in the alley of Forbidden City. They looked like ancient consorts and palace maids.</p>
<p>What was even stranger was that their figures were transparent like spirit bodies.</p>
<p>Spirit bodies weren’t rare now, but before the dimensional storms, they were terrifying.</p>
<p>At that time, Grandma Wang was still very young. She was quite frightened and immediately ran away. However, her youth made her curious. Later on, she went to the same place a few times, but she didn’t see those shadows again.</p>
<p>Grandma Wang checked the information on the Internet. It said that the magical phenomenon might be a result of lightning during a rainy day. It was like a camera that recorded past scenes. Under identical weather conditions, the footage would be played.</p>
<p>Of course, this was only a guess. No one could verify its authenticity.</p>
<p>However, this wasn’t strange. What was strange was that after the dimensional storms, every time there was a thunderstorm, strange sounds would come from the Forbidden City.</p>
<p>Although outsiders couldn’t enter Forbidden City, one could still hear some sounds from it during a thunderstorm if they lived close.</p>
<p>After Grandma Wang heard about this matter, she waited for a thunderstorm. Indeed, she heard some strange sounds coming from inside.</p>
<p>Some of the sounds reminded her of the palace maids and concubines she had seen back then.</p>
<p>This had all been personally experienced by Grandma Wang, so it was naturally true.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously searched for information about the Forbidden City on the Internet. In fact, compared to the other ancient cities, the history of Forbidden City wasn’t too long. From its establishment, it had only experienced two feudal dynasties.</p>
<p>However, its scale was incomparable to the other ancient cities.</p>
<p>Forbidden City also had the title of Eight-Armed Nezha Demonic City. If one were to mention the tallest building in the city, it would be the Hall of Supreme Harmony. It was nearly forty meters tall.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked up the information mainly to confirm the location of the so-called peak of Forbidden City. It was to prevent him from having to seek it out after entering. That would be troublesome.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen looked over from the hotel’s top floor, he discovered a strange place. The tallest building he saw from the hotel wasn’t the Hall of Supreme Harmony, but a Corner Tower in the corner of the city.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if it was because he was too far away or if it was because of the angle, he could only see the Corner Tower and not the Hall of Supreme Harmony.</p>
<p>Despite this, Zhou Wen still searched for information on Corner Towers. This search left him alarmed. Although Corner Towers were inconspicuous, the meaning it represented was extraordinary.</p>
<p>These Corner Towers were not meant for mortals to live. It was similar to Deer Terrace Pavilion. Their purpose was to guide immortals down to the mortal world and protect the safety of the imperial city. The reason they were named Corner Towers was that the immortals which were meant to be received were the corner mansions of the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions.</p>
<p>The corner mansion wasn’t unfamiliar to Zhou Wen. He even had it as a skill, so when he saw the information, Zhou Wen felt that this place was extraordinary. It might really be the peak of Forbidden City.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the architectural standards of the Corner Tower were extremely high. It had three eaves, nine beams, eighteen pillars, and seventy-two spines. Such an architectural style was unique in the Forbidden City.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that the famous Hall of Supreme Harmony was at the peak of Forbidden City, but the more he looked at it, the more he felt that a Corner Tower was the true peak of the Forbidden City.</p>
<p>Corner Towers are built on the city walls of Forbidden City, so it might indeed be taller than the Hall of Supreme Harmony, but there are four of them. Which Corner Tower should I erect the log on? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Without any accurate information, Zhou Wen could only wait until he entered Forbidden City before comparing them to the Hall of Supreme Harmony Hall.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also asked the antelope, but the antelope only said to erect it on the peak of Forbidden City. It didn’t know the exact location of the erection.</p>
<p>Could it be that I can just randomly erect it on a higher spot? Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>What Zhou Wen was most worried about was how to enter Forbidden City.</p>
<p>If he barged in, it would only give the Xia family an excuse to attack him. However, on the other hand, he would be free once he rushed into the city and erected the log.</p>
<p>With the Invisibility Cloak, who could stop him from escaping?</p>
<p>This plan looked perfect, but the premise was that he could really abandon the log. If he still couldn’t abandon it when the time came, he would be in trouble.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was hesitating, he heard someone walking towards his room.</p>
<p>Through the door, Zhou Wen could sense that the person’s bearing was extraordinary. He was in his twenties and probably not much older than An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found the person somewhat familiar, but he couldn’t recall where he had seen him.</p>
<p>“Is Zhou Wen around?” Xia Liuchuan knocked on the door and asked.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen heard the voice, he immediately recalled where he had seen him. This fellow was the Concerned Person who had tipped him off on that stormy night.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen opened the door and asked Xia Liuchuan, “Concerned Person, are you here to tip me off again?”</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan said calmly, “I don’t understand what you’re talking about. My name is Xia Liuchuan. I’m here to challenge you. This is my challenge letter. I hope you can give me an answer now.”</p>
<p>“Why are you challenging me?” Zhou Wen asked as he looked at Xia Liuchuan’s challenge.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten that you once crippled the Essence Energy sea of my Xia family members in the Holy Land?” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>“I see. I accept your challenge.” Zhou Wen actually agreed without any hesitation, surprising Xia Liuchuan.</p>
<h3 id='chapter738'>Chapter 738: Decisive Battle at the Peak of the Forbidden City</h3>
<p>1</p>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Did you read it carefully? This isn’t an ordinary challenge. We have to fight until one person falls,” Xia Liuchuan reminded him.</p>
<p>“I’ve read it carefully. I can agree to a life-and-death duel with you, but on one condition. The location of the duel has to be chosen by me,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you want to have the duel in Luoyang?” Xia Liuchuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan would have done such a thing himself. If Zhou Wen also did the same, Xia Liuchuan could have agreed if he had any say. However, he had no choice in this duel. He couldn’t agree to Zhou Wen’s request.</p>
<p>“No, it’s in the Imperial Capital,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Where do you want it to happen?” Xia Liuchuan asked.</p>
<p>To be able to fight an expert like you can be considered a boon in life. I probably won’t have many opportunities like this in life, so I naturally have to choose a place that matches you and me. How about we fight at the peak of Forbidden City? Just as Zhou Wen was worrying about how he could enter the Forbidden City, Xia Liuchuan came knocking on his door.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t care about life-and-death duels at all. As long as he could settle the crappy piece of wood, he would immediately put on the Invisibility Cloak and leave. It didn’t matter if he won.</p>
<p>“This…” Xia Liuchuan was in a difficult position.</p>
<p>It was fine to have the duel elsewhere, but Forbidden City was under the Old Master’s control. Without the Old Master’s orders, even the Xia family members couldn’t enter.</p>
<p>“What? Are you still worried when it’s your Xia family’s territory?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Alright, I promise you. Since you decided on the location, I’ll decide on the time,” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>“Sure. When?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Wait for my news.” Xia Liuchuan turned around and left.</p>
<p>This fellow is really odd. He was clearly the Concerned Person that night. Why isn’t he admitting to it? Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>However, as long as nothing unexpected happened, the matter of entering Forbidden City had been resolved by accident. With the opportunity of a duel with Xia Liuchuan, Zhou Wen could try erecting the log at higher spots.</p>
<p>Dealing with Xia Liuchuan was better than dealing with the Xia family’s gank.</p>
<p>While waiting for Xia Liuchuan’s reply, Zhou Wen stayed in his room to grind. He didn’t go anywhere.</p>
<p>Since he had nothing to do, Zhou Wen planned on trying to kill the nine black dragons. He could use Doctor Darkness’s Darkness Right Hand to kill the three black dragons.</p>
<p>After bringing all his Mythical Companion Beasts, Zhou Wen arrived at the underground sea again.</p>
<p>With Behemoth on the left, Truth Listener on the right, Six-Winged on his back, he held a golden sword in his hand. Along with the old bull under his crotch and a Torch Dragon coiled behind him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had even summoned the extremely weak Medusa. Perhaps it would be of some use if she stood by the shore to provide support.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate naturally didn’t need to be mentioned. She had already joined the battle. However, she found a cave beside the underground sea and hid there. She had no intention of participating in the battle head-on.</p>
<p>“Come, my Doctor Darkness.” Zhou Wen summoned his most important Companion Beast and made Doctor Darkness transform into a soul that fused with him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately felt his physique improve significantly. He was almost comparable to a Mythical stage entity.</p>
<p>This was the benefit of Doctor Darkness. Not only could his Companion Form bestow Zhou Wen with skills, but it could also raise Zhou Wen’s basic stats, allowing him to have the ability to fight against Mythical creatures. This was something no other Companion Beast could do.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Banana Fairy hasn’t completed her evolution. Otherwise, I would have a greater chance. Zhou Wen prepared everything and summoned some Poison Bat Companion Beasts to use as bait to lure the nine black dragons over.</p>
<p>In a short while, he saw a huge wave stir above the surface of the sea. Nine black dragons tore through the waves and wiped out the horde of Poison Bats in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>“Fight, my pets.” After Zhou Wen issued the order, Torch Dragon, Behemoth, and Truth Listener rushed into the sea.</p>
<p>As the Great Might Vajra Bull was afraid of water, it didn’t dare enter the water to fight. On the bank, it transformed into the thousand-armed, bull-headed state. Golden light shot out from its palm as it attacked the nine black dragons.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon didn’t use Bright Torch Vision World. Although using Bright Torch Vision World could instantly kill the black dragons, nothing would be left behind. That would make killing the black dragon useless.</p>
<p>In a one-on-one battle, Torch Dragon was unable to gain the upper hand without using Bright Torch Vision World. It was obvious that the black dragons were top Mythical creatures.</p>
<p>The moment Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength was unleashed, the invisible chains between the nine black dragons produced effects. They condensed the power of the nine dragons and collided with Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength. Tyrant Behemoth immediately fell into a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Truth Listener constantly harassed them from the side, but it didn’t dare clash head-on with the black dragons.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been waiting for an opportunity to use Darkness Right Hand. All he needed was for his hand to touch one black dragon.</p>
<p>However, the black dragon’s body was too huge. It was probably unrealistic to pull out its heart with a single palm, so Zhou Wen’s target was their brains.</p>
<p>He didn’t expect to dig out their brains. All he needed to do was stir them up.</p>
<p>Although the nine black dragons were independent Mythical creatures, they were connected by invisible chains. In battle, they were like one. Their attack and defense were flawless. Zhou Wen watched for a while, but he failed to find an opportunity to attack.</p>
<p>These nine black dragons are really difficult to deal with. Zhou Wen activated Doctor Darkness’s Eyes of Penetration to see if there were any weaknesses in the black dragons’ bodies.</p>
<p>If Doctor Darkness hadn’t advanced to the Mythical stage, he wouldn’t have been able to see so far with his Eyes of Penetration. His ability to see through things wasn’t that strong either, so he definitely wouldn’t be able to see through the black dragon’s body. Now, all he needed to do was approach it a little and he could clearly see the situation inside the black dragon’s body.</p>
<p>This glance left Zhou Wen slightly taken aback. In the black dragon’s brain, there was a crystal-like bead with a faint dragon-shaped stream of light swirling inside.</p>
<p>That thing can’t be the legendary dragon pearl, right? Zhou Wen carefully sized up the pearl in the black dragon’s brain and quickly made a new discovery.</p>
<p>The black dragon’s brain had the pearl as its core. Although there were parts similar to the brain, it looked like those parts were just supplementary. It was somewhat different from a human’s brain.</p>
<p>What was even more magical was that when the dragon-shaped stream of light in the dragon pearl circulated, it looked like a word. Zhou Wen carefully identified it as the word “Kan.”</p>
<p>Could it be… Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at the other eight black dragons and indeed, he found a dragon pearl in their heads. However, the words in the dragon pearls were different.</p>
<p>Qian, Kun, Zhen, Xun, Kan, Li, Gen, Dui, and Wu. The nine black dragons’ dragon pearls each had these words. The first eight words were from the Eight Trigrams, and the last word was Wu. Zhou Wen guessed that it represented Wuji—Limitless.</p>
<h3 id='chapter739'>Chapter 739: Killing the Nine Dragons</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen observed for a long period of time. By the time he was done, his luxurious lineup of Mythical pets had been destroyed by the nine black dragons. Torch Dragon was heavily injured, and despite Tyrant Behemoth roaring repeatedly, it was unable to reverse the situation.</p>
<p>Truth Listener showed signs of going berserk. The Great Might Vajra Bull onshore had been killed at some point in time.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate apparently failed to find a chance to attack. She had been hiding all this time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen directly unsummoned Truth Listener, preventing it from shattering another earring. Torch Dragon was also unsummoned. The heavily injured Torch Dragon basically didn’t have any combat strength left.</p>
<p>Torch Dragon, who couldn’t use Bright Torch Vision World, could only be considered top-notch in combat, but being top-notch wasn’t enough in such a battle.</p>
<p>Only Tyrant Behemoth was at the front line. It was being tortured by the nine black dragons as it roared angrily, but it remained completely suppressed.</p>
<p>Not only was Zhou Wen not discouraged, he even felt happy.</p>
<p>This was because, after his long period of observation, he discovered a secret of the nine black dragons.</p>
<p>If one looked at their appearance and abilities, the nine black dragons were no different. Their offensive methods were also similar, so they could be seen as nonuplets.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen’s initial plan was to kill them one by one.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen used his Eyes of Penetration to see the dragon pearls in their bodies, he discovered a special phenomenon.</p>
<p>Although the power in the nine dragons’ bodies could be transferred freely without any problems during the transfer, Zhou Wen realized that the Wu dragon pearl would light up every time their powers were transferred.</p>
<p>For example, when the Li dragon attacked by gathering the power of the nine dragons, the Li dragon pearl would light up, but the Wu dragon pearl would also light up. The other dragon pearls didn’t light up.</p>
<p>However, when the Kan dragon pearl attacked, the Kan dragon pearl would light up along with the Wu dragon pearl.</p>
<p>In other words, no matter which dragon condensed the power of the nine dragons, the Wu dragon pearl would light up along with it. Only when the Wu dragon pearl’s dragon attacked would only its dragon pearl light up.</p>
<p>From this vantage, Zhou Wen suddenly realized that perhaps the Wu dragon pearl’s dragon was the core of the nine black dragons, or rather, a transit station. Perhaps it was because of its existence that the nine black dragons could freely transfer their powers.</p>
<p>If I kill the black dragon with the Wu dragon pearl first, will the ability to combine the nine dragons’ strength as one be ineffective? Zhou Wen decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>After quitting the game and respawning the dungeon, Zhou Wen entered the game again and summoned his luxurious lineup of Mythical pets. However, this time, after getting Doctor Darkness to possess him, he switched his Essence Energy Art to the Godfiend Era. The Lost Country Life Soul ring also appeared on his finger.</p>
<p>Since I can’t find an opportunity, I’ll create one myself. Zhou Wen stared intently at the nine black dragons in the middle of the battle and locked onto the black dragon with the Wu dragon pearl.</p>
<p>The six wings on his back flapped gently as Zhou Wen gradually approached the battlefield. When the nine black dragons noticed him and were about to attack, Zhou Wen suddenly vanished.</p>
<p>The black dragon that was about to attack was slightly taken aback as Zhou Wen’s figure appeared above another black dragon.</p>
<p>He genuflected on the dragon’s head. With his left hand pressing on the dragon’s skull, his right hand stabbed into the dragon’s head with a devil-like force.</p>
<p>The hard dragon scales and dragon bones failed to block the ghostly palm. In an instant, Zhou Wen retracted his palm from the dragon’s head. And between his slender fingers was a crystalline dragon pearl.</p>
<p>After losing the dragon pearl, the black dragon was like an empty shell that had lost its brain. Its body lost its vitality and fell to the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>What surprised Zhou Wen even more, was that after he crushed the dragon pearl, the invisible chain that connected the nine black dragons shattered. The nine black dragons were immediately in a state of disunity.</p>
<p>Two black dragons roared as they charged at Zhou Wen. With Transcendent Flying Immortal, Zhou Wen’s speed wasn’t any slower than the black dragons’. Without the augmentation of the nine dragons’ collective strength, the black dragons couldn’t catch up to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>A blackish-purple sword beam streaked across the sea and stabbed into the eye of a black dragon, piercing through the dragon pearl in its head. Demonic Neonate had finally taken action and dispatched one.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tyrant Behemoth was even more excited. Without the suppression of the nine dragons’ collective strength, its Absolute Strength unleashed, snapping the dragon horn off a black dragon. Then, it threw punch after punch, shattering the black dragon’s head.</p>
<p>The nine black dragons that originally had the absolute advantage immediately became the ones being ravaged after losing the key black dragon with the Wu dragon pearl.</p>
<p>There was no need for Zhou Wen to do anything else as the luxurious lineup of Mythical pets killed the remaining black dragons.</p>
<p>Indeed, it’s difficult for those who aren’t in the know, but it’s not difficult for those who do. Knowledge is power. If I had known that these nine black dragons had such a relationship and weakness, I wouldn’t have waited until today to kill them. The saying of the forefathers is right. Know yourself and your enemy, and you will never be defeated. Zhou Wen sighed at the importance of knowledge.</p>
<p>‘Killed a Mythical Creature, True Blood Demon Dragon. Discovered Dimensional Crystal.’</p>
<p>After the True Blood Demon Dragons were killed, notices kept coming in. Finally, a True Blood Demon Dragon dropped a dimensional crystal with 80 Strength. It was very high-level and valuable, but Zhou Wen couldn’t use it now.</p>
<p>There are only two black dragons left! Zhou Wen was still looking forward to having a black dragon Companion Egg drop.</p>
<p>However, even when the last black dragon was penetrated by Demonic Neonate’s sword, it failed to drop a Companion Egg. Instead, another dimensional crystal dropped, an Essence Energy Skill Crystal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen picked up the Essence Energy Skill Crystal and realized that the stat requirement was 41 Strength and 21 Fire stat. It was different from the True Blood Demon Dragon Crystal he had previously obtained.</p>
<p>With his Strength and Fire stat lacking, Zhou Wen had no choice but to give it up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already used to it, so he didn’t feel the pinch. Seeing that his Companion Beasts weren’t injured, he led them towards the war wagon.</p>
<p>Now that the nine black dragons weren’t disturbing him, Zhou Wen wanted to give it a try to see if he could kill the Guardian in the war wagon. This was the hope for Slaughterer Life Soul’s advancement.</p>
<p>After opening the door, Zhou Wen entered with his Companion Beasts and saw the cocoon floating in the void.</p>
<p>He wasn’t in a rush to approach it. Zhou Wen used his Eyes of Penetration to look at the cocoon, hoping to see what the creature inside looked like.</p>
<p>Something strange happened. The white cocoon was clearly right in front of him, but the Light of Penetration seemed to be separated from the white cocoon by a massive distance. No matter how hard he tried, his vision couldn’t reach the white cocoon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately recalled that he had encountered the same situation when he first entered. Back then, he had wanted to pierce through the white cocoon to extract the blood, but he couldn’t touch the white cocoon no matter what. It was only because of the characteristics of the Overlord Sword that he could tear through space and touch the white cocoon in the void.</p>
<p>Light of Penetration clearly didn’t have such characteristics, so it was impossible to reach the white cocoon.</p>
<p>Since we are going to fight, there’s no point in watching. Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Overlord Sword and slashed out a sword beam that tore through the void and headed straight for the white cocoon.</p>
<h3 id='chapter740'>Chapter 740: Six Fingers</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>With the augmentation of Ever-Victorious and Unstoppable, the golden sword beam tore through the white cocoon’s shell.</p>
<p>As the cocoon cracked, Zhou Wen saw a palm extend out of the white cocoon.</p>
<p>It was a man’s palm with long and powerful fingers. Zhou Wen could clearly see that there were six fingers on the palm, but the layout of the six fingers didn’t seem out of place. It was about the same as a normal palm.</p>
<p>There was a different ring on each of the six fingers. The design and material seemed to be different. As he could only see the palm, he didn’t know what the rings looked like from the front.</p>
<p>Just as the Golden Sword Aura was about to strike the palm, an invisible fluctuation seemed to ripple from one of the rings.</p>
<p>Wherever the fluctuations passed, time and space seemed to freeze. Countless dust fragments froze as the Golden Sword Aura stopped in front of his palm.</p>
<p>Although the Golden Sword Aura was less than an inch away from the palm, it was unable to advance any further.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the Golden Sword Aura. Zhou Wen’s pets were affected by the fluctuations. Although they tried to resist the fluctuations, it was to no avail.</p>
<p>Apart from Tyrant Behemoth being able to move thanks to Absolute Strength, most of the Companion Beasts were in a frozen state.</p>
<p>Companion Beasts at Torch Dragon and Truth Listener’s level found it difficult to move amidst the fluctuations.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar was also immobilized. Zhou Wen felt that the blood-colored avatar’s bodily functions had stopped circulating. Its Essence Energy seemed to freeze as it was completely unable to move according to commands.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth roared as it charged at the white cocoon and threw a punch at the palm with six fingers.</p>
<p>The frozen dust and Golden Sword Aura were shattered by Tyrant Behemoth’s fist. Just as Tyrant Behemoth was about to strike the palm, another ring on the palm flickered.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth punched Torch Dragon’s body and immediately sent Torch Dragon’s huge body flying. It caused blood to spray out of Torch Dragon’s body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. Tyrant Behemoth had clearly struck the white cocoon, but for some reason, its fist struck Torch Dragon’s body. It looked like a spatial dislocation skill.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the guardian in the white cocoon has spatial skills, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth continued its violent attacks, but every time its fists struck the white cocoon, it would strangely strike a companion. After a few punches, the palm in the white cocoon didn’t suffer any damage. Instead, Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts were beaten up by Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>After watching for a while, Zhou Wen was certain that the Guardian was definitely a spatial expert.</p>
<p>Once Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength timer ran out, it was immobilized by the spatial fluctuations.</p>
<p>At that moment, a void that resembled a black hole appeared in the palm of the palm. It sucked in the Companion Beasts and the blood-colored avatar before the game screen went black.</p>
<p>A Guardian with spatial attributes has abilities like spatial solidification, spatial fold, and black hole. Tyrant Behemoth can fight it while using Absolute Strength… Zhou Wen organized the clues he knew, hoping to find a way to counter it.</p>
<p>I wonder if Lost Country’s spatial powers will be of some use. After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that unless Torch Dragon used Bright Torch Vision World from the beginning, it would be very difficult to kill the Guardian.</p>
<p>Why are Guardians so strong? Are there no weak Guardians that can allow me to kill for the advancement of my Life Souls? Zhou Wen waited for some time. After all his cooldowns were over, he dripped his blood to respawn and enter the game again.</p>
<p>The nine black dragons in the underground sea had yet to respawn. The war wagon was still parked at the bottom of the sea, but the door had been closed. Zhou Wen didn’t summon any other pets other than Explosive Fiend Man.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength couldn’t be used yet. Therefore, Zhou Wen didn’t think of killing the Guardian this time. He just wanted to see if his Godfiend Era was useful when fighting the Guardian.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen got Explosive Fiend Man to plant time bombs all over the war wagon one after another. After more than an hour, the war wagon was covered with time bombs.</p>
<p>Under Zhou Wen’s orders, the huge war wagon exploded like an atomic bomb. It formed a terrifying shockwave at the bottom of the sea, producing a huge jellyfish-like cavity.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had severely underestimated the might of the explosion. He had already retreated to a hundred meters away, but he still died from the blast. The game screen went black.</p>
<p>Is the war wagon’s energy so massive? Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>When he arrived in front of the war wagon again, it had already recovered to its original state. Zhou Wen began getting Explosive Fiend Man to plant time bombs around the entire wagon.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen had experience. He retreated far away and watched from a distant bank.</p>
<p>With a command, Explosive Fiend Man ignited all the time bombs. Zhou Wen, who was standing by the bank, saw the waves churning before they stirred up a tsunami-like wave.</p>
<p>Ignoring the winds and shock waves, Zhou Wen immediately dived into the sea. However, when he saw the war wagon, he was slightly taken aback. Such a terrifying explosion had failed to blast through it. The war wagon’s outer shell was damaged, but it was undergoing automatic self-repair. It didn’t take long for it to recover to its original state.</p>
<p>Seeing that it was impossible to blast the war wagon and the Guardian inside to death, Zhou Wen had no choice but to open the door and rush in.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen used the Godfiend Era Essence Energy Art. The Lost Country ring appeared on his finger before he slashed at the white cocoon.</p>
<p>After the white cocoon was sliced apart, the palm appeared again. The spatial fluctuations caused everything around it to fall silent again. The blood-colored avatar’s body was no exception.</p>
<p>However, it was somewhat different this time. Although the blood-colored avatar couldn’t move, the Godfiend Era’s Essence Energy Art continued flowing. This meant that Zhou Wen could still use Essence Energy Skills and other abilities.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen used Lost Country’s spatial teleportation ability and teleported into the white cocoon. He wanted to see what the Guardian inside the white cocoon looked like.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen teleported, he realized that he wasn’t able to teleport into the white cocoon as he wished. Instead, he appeared in front of the palm.</p>
<p>What awaited him was a black hole that had already opened in the palm. In the next second, the game screen went black again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and understood what was going on. The other party was a spatial expert, and his Lost Country was only a Primordial Life Soul. The difference in level was too great. It was already pretty good that he hadn’t been sent into the black hole when he used spatial teleportation.</p>
<h3 id='chapter741'>Chapter 741: Duel</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t discouraged. Instead, he felt that this might be an opportunity.</p>
<p>With this Guardian around, it was equivalent to having another spatial expert as a sparring partner. Perhaps there was a chance to improve Lost Country.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen dripped his blood to revive and once again entered the game to challenge the Guardian. He naturally suffered a crushing defeat, but Zhou Wen also sensed the influence the other party’s spatial powers had on him.</p>
<p>Through watching and personally experiencing the various spatial-type skills of the Guardian, Zhou Wen gained a lot more insight into spatial-type skills. No matter how much he had studied in the past, it was only theoretical knowledge. It was very rare to have such an opportunity to experience it.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was repeatedly dying from gaming, Xia Liuchuan came to the East Courtyard again and mentioned the battle he had scheduled with Zhou Wen on the peak of Forbidden City.</p>
<p>“You should know that Forbidden City is a forbidden zone of our Xia family. Outsiders are not allowed to enter,” said Old Master Xia.</p>
<p>“I know, but I also wish to fight him there.” Xia Liuchuan didn’t explain much.</p>
<p>“In that case, so be it. However, defeat is not an option. No matter what, Zhou Wen can’t leave Forbidden City again,” said Old Master Xia indifferently.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan didn’t say anything and just bowed slightly.</p>
<p>“Let’s set it to be in four days. There are still problems in Forbidden City that need handling. You should head back and prepare for now,” Old Master Xia said.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was grinding when he suddenly heard his phone ring. It was none other than Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“You really agreed to battle Xia Liuchuan?” Zhou Wen heard Wang Lu’s voice the moment he picked up the phone.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Zhou Wen replied.</p>
<p>“To battle a Xia family member in the Imperial Capital, and in the Forbidden City which they control? Are you ignoring what Grandma said to you?” Wang Lu said anxiously.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I have my own plans. Nothing will go wrong… Alright, let’s just end it here. I have a call coming in. I’ll answer it first…” Zhou Wen picked up the other call as he spoke. It was from Ouyang Lan.</p>
<p>“Little Wen, did you really agree to a duel with Xia Liuchuan in Forbidden City? Don’t be afraid. If you were forced by the Xia family, I’ll be able to help you,” Ouyang Lan said.</p>
<p>“Sis Lan, the Xia family didn’t force me. I did it willingly. Don’t worry. I can handle it.” Zhou Wen felt touched when he heard Ouyang Lan.</p>
<p>Although they were not related by blood, Ouyang Lan was indeed very concerned about him.</p>
<p>“Little Wen, your father only has you as a son. We won’t be able to have children in the future. You need to think twice before doing everything. Don’t risk your life. Tell me if there are any problems. I’ll help you resolve them.” Ouyang Lan didn’t quite believe Zhou Wen. She remained very worried.</p>
<p>“Sis Lan, there’s really no need for you to worry. It’s not convenient to speak on the phone. However, I have the ability to protect myself. Nothing will go wrong.” Zhou Wen was afraid that his phone was bugged, so he didn’t dare inform Ouyang Lan about his possession of the Invisibility Cloak.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan pleaded with Zhou Wen a few more times before his phone rang, bringing an end to his phone call with Ouyang Lan.</p>
<p>It was An Sheng. He was clearly aware that Zhou Wen was going to duel with Xia Liuchuan. However, he didn’t persuade Zhou Wen not to fight.</p>
<p>“I’m already on my way to the Imperial Capital. Is there anything I need to do in advance?” An Sheng said simply.</p>
<p>“Don’t come. I’m leaving the Imperial Capital soon,” Zhou Wen hurriedly said.</p>
<p>“I’ll wait for you outside the Imperial Capital,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Don’t do it near the Imperial Capital. Let’s have it somewhere far away.” Zhou Wen knew that he couldn’t stop An Sheng.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll think of a way to inform you when the time comes.” An Sheng hung up after saying that.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>This news quickly spread in the Imperial Capital. Anyone who was in the know felt that Zhou Wen was courting death.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that Xia Liuchuan was a rare genius in the Xia family, just the fact that he was dueling someone from the Xia family in their territory made people place their bets against Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Dugu Ge and Zhang Chunqiu were in the Imperial Capital, so they naturally heard the news.</p>
<p>“This battle will give us a perfect opportunity to see how much strength that Guardian raised Loser has,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a smile.</p>
<p>“It looks like your divination wasn’t accurate at all. You actually let Xia Liuchuan get the Guardian,” said Dugu Ge.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu smiled and said, “Destiny is unpredictable. Don’t take my divinations seriously. I’m just spouting nonsense.”</p>
<p>“Then do some more divinations. Who will win in the duel between Zhou Wen and Loser?” Dugu Ge said.</p>
<p>“Based on my divination, the Xia family will definitely not lose,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>Dugu Ge glanced at Zhang Chunqiu in contempt before returning to his room.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already received Xia Liuchuan’s notice to fight in Forbidden City in four days. However, only Zhou Wen was allowed to enter.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to contact Wang Lu, hoping to leave the antelope and chick with her.</p>
<p>“You hung up so quickly just now. Why am I in your sights again?” Wang Lu said angrily.</p>
<p>“It was my stepmother. Do you think I could reject her call?” Zhou Wen consoled.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you know about the Xia family. You really shouldn’t have agreed to the duel with Xia Liuchuan. Xia Liuchuan might not be famous and his fame might not be comparable to the younger generation’s John and Lance, but this person is definitely much more terrifying than Lance. He’s someone who has truly survived countless life-and-death situations. He’s different from those elites who were brought up in safe environments.”</p>
<p>Wang Lu continued, “Although Xia Liuchuan is known as the most profligate scion of the Xia family, his talent and social connection aren’t inferior to An Tianzuo’s. My grandmother met him when he was six. Back then, Old Master Xia took him to the Ancient Sword Tomb to play. At that time, a Mythical sword happened to appear. Xia Liuchuan, who was only six years old, saw the battle between the Mythical sword and humans and actually comprehended a Mythical sword technique. His talent in combat is terrifying.”</p>
<p>“If he’s not strong, it would be meaningless,” Zhou Wen said with a smile. He just didn’t want Wang Lu to be too worried.</p>
<p>“If it were anywhere else, it wouldn’t be a problem for you to fight Xia Liuchuan. However, that’s Forbidden City. How can you fight Xia Liuchuan there? Even if you defeat him, it will be difficult for you to walk out,” Wang Lu sighed.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. If I, Zhou Wen, want to leave, no one in the Federation can stop me,” Zhou Wen said with certainty.</p>
<p>Wang Lu knew that it was too late to say anything now. Zhou Wen had already accepted the challenge, so it was too late for regrets.</p>
<p>Four days quickly passed. The Xia family took the initiative to send a car to pick Zhou Wen up, but Zhou Wen rejected them. He carried the wooden log and walked towards Forbidden City.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that he didn’t want to take the car, but the car couldn’t fit the log.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter742'>Chapter 742: Pure Hook Evil-Slaying</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen arrived in front of Forbidden City’s city gates and saw many people gathered outside. They were all here to watch the battle, but because the city gates were sealed, no one could enter.</p>
<p>The Meridian Gate was tightly shut with people from the Xia family standing guard outside. Forbidden City had four city gates, but usually, only Meridian Gate could be opened. The other three city gates needed a certain opportunity for their opening, so the only way to enter and exit Forbidden City was through the Meridian Gate.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, Young Master Xia is already waiting for you in the city. Please enter,” a Xia family guard said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was about to walk in with the log when he was stopped by the guard.</p>
<p>“People can enter, but things have to be left outside,” the guard said as he pointed at the log on Zhou Wen’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Does your Xia family have to take away their opponent’s weapons before a battle?” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>The moment Zhou Wen said that, the onlookers roared with laughter. Although they didn’t believe that Zhou Wen really used such a huge club as a weapon, it didn’t stop them from feeling contempt towards the Xia family’s high-handedness.</p>
<p>“Let him in,” a middle-aged man on top of the city gates said to the guard.</p>
<p>Only then did the guard let Zhou Wen enter the city with the log.</p>
<p>“Old Master, is it really a good idea to let him in like this? If there’s really something wrong with the log as Liuchuan said, wouldn’t it be very disadvantageous for him?” the middle-aged man said to Old Master Xia, who was sitting at the top of the city gate to watch the battle.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. This is Forbidden City. Even if Leng Zongzheng is hidden in that log, he won’t be able to escape unscathed today,” Old Master Xia said calmly.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>On a tall building in the distance of Forbidden City, Shen Yuchi was looking at the situation around Meridian Gate with his binoculars.</p>
<p>He couldn’t enter Forbidden City; he probably wouldn’t be able to see anything even if he went to the Meridian Gate.</p>
<p>“Siyuan, what’s your take regarding this battle’s outcome?” Shen Yuchi asked Qiao Siyuan when he saw Zhou Wen enter the Meridian Gate.</p>
<p>“I believe regardless of the outcome today, it will be very difficult for Zhou Wen to walk out of Forbidden City,” Qiao Siyuan replied.</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi didn’t comment as he continued using his binoculars to observe the situation inside Forbidden City.</p>
<p>However, there was a mysterious interference from Forbidden City. They could only see the area above the buildings, but not the actual situation inside.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked through the Meridian Gate and saw five white compounds leading to the Gate of Supreme Harmony. Xia Liuchuan was standing in front of it.</p>
<p>Passing through the Gate of Supreme Harmony was the Hall of Supreme Harmony. However, it was unknown if the layout of the city had changed after the dimensional storms.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked around but didn’t see any dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to look around. There are no dimensional creatures in Forbidden City. You can fight me with all your might without worry,” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>“That’s great. However, since it’s the final battle at the peak of Forbidden City, let’s fight at a higher spot. I think it’s quite high there. Why don’t we head there?” Zhou Wen said as he pointed in the direction of a Corner Tower.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to go through so much trouble,” Xia Liuchuan said as a sword appeared in his hand. “This sword’s name is Ancient Pure Hook. It’s a Mythical Companion Beast. I believe you also have a Mythical Companion Beast, so I won’t hide it.”</p>
<p>With that said, Xia Liuchuan thrust his sword at Zhou Wen. He was a straightforward person who fought without any hesitation.</p>
<p>The sword beam was like snow. His body and sword seemed to instantly appear in front of Zhou Wen at an unbelievable speed.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was proficient in movement techniques, it was impossible for him to dodge such a fast sword while carrying such a heavy log. Therefore, he could only draw his saber to fend off the attack.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The saber and sword collided. Zhou Wen’s body remained motionless, but Xia Liuchuan was forced to take a few steps back.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Zhou Wen’s strength was stronger than Xia Liuchuan’s, but that the log he was carrying was too heavy. It pressed down on his body, stopping him from retreating.</p>
<p>Although Xia Liuchuan retreated, he didn’t lose his balance. He tapped the ground with his toe and thrust his sword forward again. His sword technique was swift and fierce like a ghost.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s saber techniques weren’t slow either. He held the log with one hand and brandished his saber with the other. The saber and sword constantly clashed, and Zhou Wen advanced step by step, gradually approaching the Gate of Supreme Harmony.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to try his luck at the Hall of Supreme Harmony. After all, it was the most honorable place in the city. It was most likely the peak of Forbidden City.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there was only one Hall of Supreme Harmony, but there were four Corner Towers. If the Hall of Supreme Harmony didn’t work, it wouldn’t be too late for him to consider trying the Corner Towers.</p>
<p>“To be able to master such a mature and steady saber technique at such a young age, this Zhou Wen is indeed extraordinary.” Old Master Xia narrowed his eyes as though he was admiring a treasure.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen once defeated John who had a contract with the Guardian. His strength is indeed extraordinary. Furthermore, according to our investigations, he definitely has more than two Mythical Companion Beasts,” the middle-aged man said.</p>
<p>“The stronger he is, the better.” Old Master Xia smiled.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally hoped to fight all the way to the front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony, but Xia Liuchuan clearly wouldn’t be suppressed by him the entire time.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan’s figure suddenly changed as he appeared behind Zhou Wen like a phantom, stabbing at his back.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was just too slow while carrying the wooden log. He didn’t have the time to turn around, but he didn’t plan on doing so anyway. He swung his saber and blocked Xia Liuchuan’s strike.</p>
<p>“The log on your body is too heavy. Why don’t you put it down so that we can fight?” Xia Liuchuan didn’t continue attacking as he looked at Zhou Wen’s back.</p>
<p>“I’ll naturally put it down when it’s time to put it down,” Zhou Wen turned around and said to Xia Liuchuan.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan didn’t say anything else. However, the Pure Hook Sword in his hand emitted a strange glow. It was like a holy sword that made people have the urge to prostrate themselves in worship.</p>
<p>This time, Xia Liuchuan attacked again, but it wasn’t that easy to deal with. When the Bamboo Blade and the Pure Hook Sword met, Zhou Wen felt his palm shake as he involuntarily took a few steps back. The Bamboo Blade nearly flew out of his hand.</p>
<p>“The Pure Hook Sword is known as the Exalted Peerless Sword. It can bestow me with power at the Mythical stage,” Xia Liuchuan said as he brandished his sword again.</p>
<p>With a thought from Zhou Wen, Doctor Darkness transformed into a soul and attached to him. Zhou Wen brandished his saber to fend him off again. Although he was still sent retreating by the Pure Hook Sword, he wasn’t as pathetic as before.</p>
<p>“Just show me what you’ve got. There’s no need to hide it,” Zhou Wen said as he held his saber.</p>
<p>“As you wish.” Xia Liuchuan waved his left hand and another sword appeared in his hand.</p>
<p>This sword was different from the Pure Hook Sword. It was a small sword that was about sixty centimeters long. It wasn’t as beautiful as the Pure Hook Sword, as though it carried a sense of resentment.</p>
<p>“The sword’s name is Evil-Slaying. It’s also a Mythical Companion Beast. I’ve cultivated for so many years, and most of my techniques are delivered through these two swords,” Xia Liuchuan said as he glanced at the sword in his hand with a glazed look.</p>
<h3 id='chapter743'>Chapter 743: Sword Warp</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that Xia Liuchuan’s aura changed once he had two swords in hand. His expression couldn’t help but turn solemn.</p>
<p>The sword in Xia Liuchuan’s hand finally moved, but his body didn’t move. The Evil-Slaying Sword flew over and stabbed at Zhou Wen in a flash, as though it was about to penetrate his right eye.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen brandished his saber and slashed, sending the Evil-Slaying Sword flying. However, Xia Liuchuan and his Pure Hook Sword arrived in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The Bamboo Blade had just slashed out, preventing it from being retractable in time. Zhou Wen abruptly crouched and dodged the Pure Hook Sword’s thrust. At the same time, the log smashed down on Xia Liuchuan’s head.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Xia Liuchuan’s figure flashed and vanished in front of Zhou Wen. As for the Pure Hook Sword, it turned from a stab into a slash that was aimed at Zhou Wen’s neck.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan arrived beside the Evil-Slaying Sword through some unknown means. He grabbed it with one hand and stabbed it down at Zhou Wen’s back.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen brandished his saber to fend off the Pure Hook Sword, but he no longer had the time to block the Evil-Slaying Sword behind him.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>A scalpel appeared behind Zhou Wen and blocked the Evil-Slaying Sword’s attack as Doctor Darkness separated from Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Wen, he had also switched to the Ancient Sovereign Sutra and fused with the Defy Ancient Sovereign. His body became filled with energy as he used the Demon Dragon True Body, allowing him to gain Mythical combat strength for a short period of time. He forcefully sent the Pure Hook Sword flying.</p>
<p>After sending the Pure Hook Sword flying, Zhou Wen turned around and slashed at Xia Liuchuan. Xia Liuchuan’s expression remained unchanged as the Evil-Slaying Sword in his hand continued stabbing at Zhou Wen. It was as though he hadn’t seen Doctor Darkness’s scalpel or Zhou Wen’s Bamboo Blade.</p>
<p>If the two of them continued the trajectories of their thrust, the scalpel and Bamboo Blade would hit Xia Liuchuan while the Evil-Slaying Sword would pierce through Zhou Wen’s chest.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Bamboo Blade to block the Evil-Slaying Sword, but Xia Liuchuan’s figure vanished. He appeared beside the Pure Hook Sword that had been sent flying and grabbed it for another midair slash.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan’s figure kept moving about as though he was performing a magic trick. He appeared beside the Evil-Slaying Sword one moment and appeared beside the Pure Hook Sword the next moment.</p>
<p>This teleportation wasn’t as simple as being fast. It was similar to Lost Country’s teleportation, but there were no restrictions on the teleportation.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t have as much freedom as teleportation. It could be seen that Xia Liuchuan could only move between the two swords.</p>
<p>Although that was the case, it was already difficult for Zhou Wen to deal with him. Xia Liuchuan used two swords and constantly moved back and forth like a ghost. It made Zhou Wen feel that it was harder than fighting three Mythical opponents at the same time.</p>
<p>The most uncomfortable thing was that he couldn’t fight Xia Liuchuan because Xia Liuchuan could move to the side of another sword at any time. If he attacked, he wouldn’t be able to injure Xia Liuchuan and would only end up being injured by him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Doctor Darkness joined forces, but they were still suppressed by Xia Liuchuan. They had no chance of charging to the Gate of Supreme Harmony.</p>
<p>If I wasn’t carrying such a huge object, I wouldn’t be at such a disadvantage. Zhou Wen was best at movement techniques. However, the log prevented him from using the movement techniques he was good at. It was extremely uncomfortable fighting.</p>
<p>“Liuchuan’s Sword Warp technique has improved,” the middle-aged man praised.</p>
<p>“Sword Warp requires talent, and it’s easy to learn but difficult to master. Little Chuan likes such techniques, but there’s actually not much need for it. The time spent would be better spent on Guardians,” Old Master Xia said calmly.</p>
<p>Although Old Master Xia didn’t approve of Xia Liuchuan spending all his time on the Sword Warp technique, Zhou Wen was now quite depressed from being suppressed by it.</p>
<p>This Sword Warp technique was like an illusion. Under Xia Liuchuan’s usage, it was unpredictable and dazzling.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, Letting this continue wouldn’t work. Since I’ve already entered Forbidden City, there’s no need to fight him. I should quickly place the log on the Hall of Supreme Harmony and give it a try.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull.</p>
<p>The moment the Great Might Vajra Bull came out, it shook the bell on its neck. Once the Soul Suppression Bell rang, Xia Liuchuan immediately felt dizzy. The two swords fell from the sky with him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took this opportunity to get Doctor Darkness to possess him again as he charged in the direction of the Gate of Supreme Harmony.</p>
<p>However, after running a few steps, a sword beam flashed. Zhou Wen tilted his head and saw the Evil-Slaying Sword fly past his ear. Xia Liuchuan instantly moved to the side of the Evil-Slaying Sword and slashed at Zhou Wen’s face with it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen swiped up his saber and clashed with Xia Liuchuan’s Evil-Slaying Sword several times. Xia Liuchuan’s sword techniques were unpredictable, so Zhou Wen wasn’t able to gain any advantage.</p>
<p>The Great Might Vajra Bull turned around to help Zhou Wen, but the moment it turned around, Xia Liuchuan appeared behind the Great Might Vajra Bull like a phantom. He held the Pure Hook Sword and stabbed the Great Might Vajra Bull’s buttocks.</p>
<p>“Moo!” The Great Might Vajra Bull’s pupils constricted as it raised its hind legs and kicked Xia Liuchuan.</p>
<p>In response, Xia Liuchuan waved his hand and threw the Pure Hook Sword at Zhou Wen. At the same time, he warped to the side of the Evil-Slaying Sword and continued fighting Zhou Wen with it. The entire process was like a magic show. If not for the Great Might Vajra Bull’s powerful physique, any ordinary person would have been killed by Xia Liuchuan.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen blocked the Evil-Slaying Sword, he summoned the Golden Overlord Sword. However, he didn’t have any spare hands to use it. All he could do was let the Golden Overlord Sword attack autonomously in its original form.</p>
<p>The Great Might Vajra Bull used its Life Soul and transformed into the thousand-handed, bull-headed state. Golden light shot out from its palm as it attempted to kill Xia Liuchuan.</p>
<p>However, Xia Liuchuan was one with his two swords. He constantly teleported and fought, making it seem harder to fight him than simultaneously fighting three people. Zhou Wen, together with the Great Might Vajra Bull and the Golden Overlord Sword, failed to gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>What swordplay do you practice? Why aren’t you a magician? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. He originally didn’t want to be too ostentatious, but now that he couldn’t escape Xia Liuchuan, he had no choice but to think of other solutions.</p>
<p>Should I let Tyrant Behemoth fight? Zhou Wen considered Tyrant Behemoth. It had already appeared on the rankings, so exposing it didn’t matter much.</p>
<p>Carrying such a heavy piece of wood, Zhou Wen really couldn’t escape Xia Liuchuan. Without any hesitation, he summoned Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth landed on the ground out of thin air, causing the ground to tremble.</p>
<p>“Tyrant Behemoth? It’s actually Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast?” Old Master Xia and the middle-aged man revealed looks of surprise.</p>
<p>Many people were investigating the identity of Tyrant Behemoth’s owner. Most people believed that Tyrant Behemoth was a Companion Beast of an expert in the West District, but they never expected it to be in Zhou Wen’s hands.</p>
<p>Outside Forbidden City, there was someone who was even more surprised than Old Master Xia and company. It was Zhang Chunqiu. Zhang Chunqiu had used his Heavenly Eye to see Tyrant Behemoth in Forbidden City. Furthermore, he knew very well that the Tyrant Behemoth Companion Egg had originally belonged to the Zhang family, but it had been smuggled out by a traitor.</p>
<h3 id='chapter744'>Chapter 744: Myriad Sword Formation</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>After Tyrant Behemoth appeared, it directly activated Absolute Strength. Space distorted as the Pure Hook and Evil-Slaying swords were attracted towards Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Although Xia Liuchuan had tried his best to escape this situation, Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength was just too powerful. He couldn’t escape the two Mythical swords as he flew towards Tyrant Behemoth with his sword.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t stop as he ran towards the Gate of Supreme Harmony without waiting for the outcome.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t run fast while carrying the wooden log. Before he reached the Gate of Supreme Harmony, he suddenly heard a terrifying sound. The shock wave broke through the sound barrier and produced a terrifying sonic boom.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned his head and saw Xia Liuchuan levitating in midair. He was wearing a strange black armor that resembled some kind of black jade. It also emitted a mysterious black light.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan held Pure Hook and Evil-Slaying with both hands as he crossed them in front of him, blocking Tyrant Behemoth’s punch. He wasn’t sent flying.</p>
<p>That’s… Guardian… Zhou Wen could tell that the armor was somewhat odd. Its aura didn’t seem like a Companion Beast but resembled more of a Guardian.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Xia Liuchuan was able to withstand Tyrant Behemoth in its Absolute Strength state. This wasn’t something an ordinary Companion Beast armor could do.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan wasn’t at a disadvantage when fighting Tyrant Behemoth. The two swords in his hands criss-crossed as he fought Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw that Xia Liuchuan didn’t have the upper hand, he immediately continued running towards the Gate of Supreme Harmony. He had to first escape the log. Otherwise, even if the Guardian was in front of him, he wouldn’t be able to kill the Guardian while carrying it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen rushed past the Gate of Supreme Harmony and couldn’t help but stop. This was because after passing the gates, there were many people standing in the open space. There were probably more than ten thousand of them.</p>
<p>The ten thousand people stood in a square formation on the empty ground. Each of them held a sword in their hands, but no one spoke. They were silent.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Zhou Wen walk over, the eyes of the ten thousand people looked at him in unison.</p>
<p>In front of the square formation stood a woman in black. She was none other than the Xia Xuanyue whom Zhou Wen knew.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, why are you here instead of dueling Xia Liuchuan?” Xia Xuanyue asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Ahem, I’m just taking a stroll. It’s rare to come to the legendary Forbidden City. I want to see the legendary Hall of Supreme Harmony,” Zhou Wen said with a light cough.</p>
<p>“It’s best you go back and fight. Forbidden City isn’t a place outsiders can enter as they wish,” Xia Xuanyue said.</p>
<p>“Since I’m already here, let me take a look.” Zhou Wen naturally wasn’t willing to retreat. Although the Xia family was already wary of him, he had to make an attempt on the Hall of Supreme Harmony regardless.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen took two steps forward, Xia Xuanyue raised the ancient sword in her hand. The ten thousand people raised the sword in their hands at the same time. In an instant, countless sword beams surged into the sky and condensed towards the ancient sword in Xia Xuanyue’s hand.</p>
<p>With the augmentation of more than ten thousand ancient swords, the sword beam produced by the ancient sword in Xia Xuanyue’s hand was already terrifying beyond imagination. Even the Golden Overlord Sword paled in comparison.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could roughly tell that the ancient sword in Xia Xuanyue’s hand was similar to the Golden Harp. They could gather some kind of power.</p>
<p>The difference was that the Golden Harp allowed sound waves to resonate, while the ancient sword in Xia Xuanyue’s hand could condense the sword beams of other sword-type Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Every sword in the sword formation of more than ten thousand people was probably an Epic Companion Beast. With the augmentation of more than ten thousand sword beams, and the fact that the ancient sword might be at the Mythical stage, the might of the sword was probably not inferior to a top-notch Mythical creature.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you should return to fight Xia Liuchuan,” Xia Xuanyue said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What if I insist on touring Forbidden City?” Zhou Wen walked towards the sword formation.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue slashed with her sword as a terrifying sword beam slashed down like a heavenly river. It was difficult for Zhou Wen to dodge, so he could only use the Golden Overlord Sword’s Golden Sword Aura to meet it.</p>
<p>The Golden Sword Aura was indestructible. In the beginning, it had indeed sliced through the sword beam that resembled a heavenly river, but the sword beam seemed to pour down endlessly. Soon, it drowned the Golden Sword Aura.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue didn’t really slash down. She retracted the ancient sword in her hand and the sword beam circled back like a dragon before returning to the sword formation.</p>
<p>“Please return,” Xia Xuanyue said expressionlessly.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen turned around and left the Gate of Supreme Harmony. The ten-thousand sword formation was just too powerful. It would probably take quite some time to storm through it. Zhou Wen planned on heading to the unguarded building to give it a try to prevent any delays.</p>
<p>When Xia Liuchuan saw Zhou Wen come out, he had no intention of attacking him. He continued fighting Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>When Tyrant Behemoth used Absolute Strength, it could only fight Xia Liuchuan to a draw. Once Absolute Strength ran out, it probably wouldn’t be Xia Liuchuan’s match.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen rushed to the Corner Tower and, when he arrived in front of it, he leaped up and jumped onto the city wall before jumping to the top of the Corner Tower.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that he didn’t want to complete the jump in one try, but the log was too heavy. He couldn’t do it with a single jump.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen erected the log at the top of the Corner Tower and realized that there was no reaction. He tried to release the log and the word “slave” immediately appeared on his forehead.</p>
<p>It’s not here? Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed as he carried the log down Corner Tower. He knew that this time, he could only attempt the Myriad Sword Formation led by Xia Xuanyue.</p>
<p>It was highly likely that the peak of Forbidden City was the top of the Hall of Supreme Harmony.</p>
<p>After this ordeal, Absolute Strength didn’t have much time left. There were probably only about ten minutes left.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan clearly wanted to defeat Tyrant Behemoth first, so he wasn’t in a rush to chase after Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen passed through the door again and could already see the Hall of Supreme Harmony in front of him. However, with the Myriad Sword Formation obstructing him, it was impossible to gain passage without destroying it.</p>
<p>The ten-thousand sword formation’s might is too powerful. Among my Companion Beasts, probably only Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World can match it. If Truth Listener breaks two earrings, it might be able to put up a fight, but it’s not convenient for either of them to be exposed… Zhou Wen thought of something as his eyes suddenly lit up.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, why are you back?” Xia Xuanyue asked with a frown when she saw Zhou Wen running over.</p>
<p>“Xia Liuchuan isn’t my match. There’s no point in fighting him. I still want to visit the Hall of Supreme Harmony,” Zhou Wen said as he walked towards Xia Xuanyue.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue raised her sword again without any hesitation. The sword formation regenerated as a terrifying sword beam emitted a terrifying might. From afar, it made one’s scalp tingle.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen summoned a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>This Companion Beast wasn’t Torch Dragon or Truth Listener, nor was it Demonic Neonate. Instead, it was a beautiful girl. She was unbelievably beautiful. She had long hair that made all women envious, and her eyes were extremely charming. It was as though a single glance would entrance one, preventing them from moving their eyes away.</p>
<p>The Xia family disciples in the Myriad Sword Formation couldn’t help but look at the beautiful girl.</p>
<h3 id='chapter745'>Chapter 745: Eyes of Enticement</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Previously, Medusa had caused a stir on the Peninsula of Gods, letting the entire Federation know of her existence.</p>
<p>However, all the videos that people saw were of Medusa—the snake-haired demoness. Not many had seen her maiden form.</p>
<p>Furthermore, ever since Medusa had been killed, no new Medusa had passed through the spatial rift to enter the Curse Demon Palace.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Xia family members didn’t recognize the maiden Medusa. If they knew her, they definitely wouldn’t dare to look at her or her eyes.</p>
<p>Unlike the snake-haired demoness, Medusa did not have the ability to petrify others. Her Eyes of Enticement needed others to see her eyes before they could be of use.</p>
<p>At this moment, more than ten thousand Xia family disciples saw Medusa’s eyes. Immediately, their bodies petrified as they turned pale with fright.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue’s expression changed drastically as she immediately realized the problem. She closed her eyes and slashed at Medusa.</p>
<p>However, because many owners of Epic swords had seen Medusa’s eyes, their bodies slowly petrified. They were unable to circulate their Essence Energy, nor could they use the Epic swords in their hands to cooperate with Xia Xuanyue. This greatly reduced the might of Xia Xuanyue’s sword beam.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the Golden Overlord Sword and slashed out a sword beam to clash with Xia Xuanyue’s sword beam.</p>
<p>The ancient sword in Xia Xuanyue’s hand was also transformed from a Mythical Companion Beast. It wasn’t inferior to the Golden Overlord Sword, but the stats of the Golden Overlord Sword were too domineering. When the sword beams collided, the ancient sword beam shattered due to the loss of the Myriad Sword Formation’s augmentation. The Golden Overlord Sword’s sword beam continued slashing at Xia Xuanyue.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue closed her eyes and shifted her body, dodging the Golden Sword Aura. At the same time, she brandished her sword and attacked Zhou Wen. Her movement technique was the Path to Snatching Heaven that Zhou Wen had seen before.</p>
<p>Back then, Zhou Wen had fought Xia Xuanyue, giving him the chance to advance the Transcendent Flying Immortal to the divine level. In that battle, Xia Xuanyue had also comprehended the profundity of the Path to Snatching Heaven, allowing it to advance to the divine level as well.</p>
<p>Now, Xia Xuanyue’s Path to Snatching Heaven had become more mature, giving her the boldness to snatch a path from heaven Just her movement technique alone gave others a huge sense of oppression.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was carrying the log, he was unable to use Transcendent Flying Immortal to compete with Xia Xuanyue’s Path to Snatching Heaven. The Golden Overlord Sword was a little clumsy and wasn’t suitable for fighting Xia Xuanyue. Zhou Wen threw the Golden Overlord Sword out and allowed it to attack autonomously. He drew his Bamboo Blade and clashed with Xia Xuanyue’s sword.</p>
<p>Medusa retreated to the side under Zhou Wen’s control. Her combat strength was very weak, so he was afraid that Xia Xuanyue’s sword beam could kill her. It wasn’t suitable for her to participate in the battle.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen couldn’t summon her back. This was because the Eyes of Enticement couldn’t permanently petrify people. It required them to see her to remain petrified.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen were to unsummon her, those people would shortly recover from their petrified states.</p>
<p>Although they were both petrification skills, Medusa’s skill was Eyes of Enticement. Its nature was different from the Eyes of Petrification.</p>
<p>Previously, when Zhou Wen had fought Medusa, Truth Listener’s Evil Nullification could restrain the snake-haired demoness’s Eyes of Petrification, but it couldn’t restrain the Eyes of Enticement. This was because the two had different attributes.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue thought that Zhou Wen had killed the ten thousand swordsmen. She was filled with grief as she no longer held back with the ancient sword in her hand. Together with the Path to Snatching Heaven, she slashed at Zhou Wen again and again.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Although my Xia family is big, among the younger generation, only Liuchuan and Little Yue are promising talents. To be able to cultivate the Path to Snatching Heaven to such a level, I’m afraid even Liuchuan couldn’t do it at her age, right?” On the city gates, the middle-aged man sighed.</p>
<p>A strange look flashed across Old Master Xia’s eyes and he said calmly, “Little Yue is very talented, but it’s a pity that she’s a girl and can’t inherit the Xia family’s business.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>The middle-aged man said, “However, our Xia family can be considered extremely lucky since Little Yue can support Liuchuan in the future.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu was also paying attention to the battle in Forbidden City. When he saw Xia Xuanyue’s movement technique, he couldn’t help but praise, “Excellent movement technique. Dugu, your movement technique isn’t much better, right?”</p>
<p>“Her movement technique isn’t inferior to mine.” Dugu Ge nodded.</p>
<p>Dugu Ge couldn’t see the situation inside Forbidden City, but when Zhou Wen entered the city, he had already secretly released some Gu worms to sneak in. Using the information transmitted by the Gu worms, he was also aware of the situation inside.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Shen Yuchi and the others from the bureau had been using their binoculars to observe the situation inside the city. However, there was a mysterious force inside the city that prevented ordinary binoculars from seeing anything. They could only occasionally see terrifying sword beams shoot out, but nothing else.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was rather familiar with the Path to Snatching Heaven. Although he couldn’t dodge, the Bamboo Blade in his hand blocked Xia Xuanyue’s sword again and again. As he fought, he retreated in the direction of the Hall of Supreme Harmony.</p>
<p>“This Zhou Wen is really impressive. He can actually withstand such an amazing movement technique and sword technique despite carrying such a heavy piece of wood,” praised Dugu Ge.</p>
<p>“Don’t you think that Zhou Wen seems to know Xia Xuanyue’s movement technique very well? It looks like he can predict the future,” Zhang Chunqiu said with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>“Is it a special ability? I heard that there’s a girl in the Ultimate Family Clan who has the Eye of Odin and can see through everything,” Dugu Ge mused and said.</p>
<p>“No, I think it’s more like Zhou Wen knows Xia Xuanyue’s movement technique very well,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“Are you saying that Zhou Wen and Xia Xuanyue have something between them?” Dugu Ge said straightforwardly. He wasn’t like Zhang Chunqiu who spoke half-truths.</p>
<p>“I only know that Zhou Wen definitely knows Xia Xuanyue’s movement technique very well. I don’t know if there’s anything between them,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a shrug.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Up on the city gates, Old Master Xia and the middle-aged man also frowned. Clearly, they shared the same thoughts as Zhang Chunqiu. Xia Xuanyue’s amazing Path to Snatching Heaven was actually blocked by Zhou Wen’s saber. It was as though he had predicted the future. This was definitely not something that could be explained by just having powerful saber techniques.</p>
<p>“Little Yue once represented our Xia family to be the witness for Zhou Wen’s battle in Luoyang. Perhaps she crossed paths with him back then. Perhaps she fought Zhou Wen before and not because she deliberately leaked the Path to Snatching Heaven,” the middle-aged man said.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen’s understanding of the Path to Snatching Heaven isn’t as simple as exchanging blows,” Old Master Xia said indifferently. “Ah Cheng, go and settle this matter.”</p>
<p>“What about Liuchuan…” The middle-aged man, Ah Cheng, was somewhat hesitant.</p>
<p>“I’ve given him too much time,” Old Master Xia said expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“I know what to do.” Ah Cheng bowed slightly before jumping down the city gates and walking towards the Gate of Supreme Harmony.</p>
<p>When Xia Liuchuan, who was fighting Tyrant Behemoth, saw Ah Cheng coming down, his expression changed slightly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter746'>Chapter 746: Great Array</h3>
<p>“Uncle Cheng, I can handle it myself. You don’t have to do anything,” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Old Master can’t wait any longer.” As Ah Cheng spoke, he continued walking towards the Gate of Supreme Harmony. Soon, he passed through it and saw Zhou Wen fighting Xia Xuanyue.</p>
<p>“Little Yue, you can stand down. Leave this to me,” said Ah Cheng.</p>
<p>“Uncle Cheng, I can handle it myself,” Xia Xuanyue replied.</p>
<p>“This is Old Master’s order,” Ah Cheng said.</p>
<p>When Xia Xuanyue heard the words “Old Master,” she had no choice but to back out from the battle and go to Ah Cheng’s side.</p>
<p>Ah Cheng extended his hand and a strange yellow talisman appeared. The moment it appeared, golden runes lit up on the ground in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony. It blanketed the huge space in golden light instantly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately felt as though he had fallen into a huge vortex. The Essence Energy in his body was sucked out before rapidly flowing into the vortex.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Zhou Wen himself. Even the Companion Beasts he summoned suffered the same fate. The Golden Overlord Sword and Medusa were rapidly drained of their Essence Energy.</p>
<p>The petrified Xia family disciples and their Epic Companion Beast swords didn’t receive any special care.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly retracted Medusa and the Golden Overlord Sword. At the same time, he switched his Essence Energy Art to the Dao Sutra. The Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder also appeared in his consciousness.</p>
<p>Such an array formation was similar to the Explosive Fiend Man’s time bomb. It needed to be prepared ahead of time. Clearly, the Xia family was very careful and had prepared everything. Even if Xia Liuchuan couldn’t win, they could still kill Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>With the appearance of the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, Zhou Wen immediately felt the Essence Energy in his body stop leaking. With a thought, he retracted Tyrant Behemoth who was fighting Xia Liuchuan.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength was almost up. There was no need to continue fighting.</p>
<p>“We agreed on a duel. Isn’t your Xia family being too shameless?” Zhou Wen pretended to be alarmed as he struggled to retreat.</p>
<p>Ah Cheng said indifferently, “You were the one who didn’t duel. How can you blame our Xia family for not honoring our promise?”</p>
<p>“Alright, count yourselves lucky. I’ll admit defeat, alright? Stop your array formation,” Zhou Wen shouted as he retreated. He was already very close to the Hall of Supreme Harmony—less than fifty meters away. Any closer and he would be able to jump onto the top of the Hall of Supreme Harmony.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen didn’t know if the Hall of Supreme Harmony was the peak of Forbidden City or if it could help him escape the log.</p>
<p>“It’s already too late,” Ah Cheng said.</p>
<p>“It’s easy for you to want my life. But don’t tell me you have zero concern about the lives of the ten thousand Xia family members?” Zhou Wen pointed at the petrified Xia family members.</p>
<p>As Medusa had been unsummoned by Zhou Wen, their petrified bodies were gradually recovering.</p>
<p>Seeing that they weren’t dead, Xia Xuanyue couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief. She had thought that Zhou Wen had killed all of them and was extremely furious. Only now did she realize that Zhou Wen hadn’t really killed them.</p>
<p>However, just like Zhou Wen, they were trapped in the array. Furthermore, they didn’t have the protection of the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. Their Essence Energy was constantly devoured by the array. Before the petrification on their bodies completely subsided, their Essence Energy was nearly sucked dry.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan walked over and said, “Uncle Cheng, stop. If this continues, they will all die.”</p>
<p>Ah Cheng shook his head. “Before dealing with Zhou Wen, the array can’t be deactivated.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still retreating. Having already retreated to the edge of the array, the light barrier formed at the edge of the array blocked his path. The thin layer of golden light was like a metal wall. Zhou Wen tried his best several times, but he failed to slam through it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as long as Essence Energy struck the barrier, it would immediately be absorbed by the barrier, making its defense even stronger.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still fine. His Essence Energy hadn’t really been sucked away.</p>
<p>The Xia family’s disciples didn’t share his prowess. They were nearly drained dry. Some of them had already recovered from the petrification. They rushed to the edge of the array formation, but like Zhou Wen, no matter how hard they tried, they couldn’t break through the barrier.</p>
<p>Soon, their Essence Energy was sucked dry. After their Essence Energy was sucked dry, the array didn’t let them off. Their essence, vitality, and spirit were extracted after their Essence Energy was drained.</p>
<p>Their bodies aged at a speed visible to the naked eye. They looked extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>Many Xia family members shouted in horror as they struggled to escape the hellish array.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue’s expression was complicated. She never expected to see such a scene. Furthermore, she was part of the reason why these people ended up like this.</p>
<p>If she hadn’t failed to stop Zhou Wen, Ah Cheng wouldn’t have taken action—the ten thousands of Xia family members wouldn’t have been trapped in the array.</p>
<p>“Uncle Cheng, I’m sorry!” Xia Xuanyue gritted her teeth and suddenly brandished her sword, stabbing the yellow talisman in front of Ah Cheng.</p>
<p>Ah Cheng never expected Xia Xuanyue to unsheathe her sword beside him. He was caught off guard as the yellow talisman was pierced by the sword beam.</p>
<p>As the yellow talisman shattered, the array’s golden light immediately cracked. The light barrier vanished as the golden runes on the ground dimmed.</p>
<p>“Little Yue… You…” Ah Cheng’s expression changed drastically. He wasn’t worried that the array formation would release Zhou Wen after breaking, there was another reason.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan was also shocked. He turned to look in the direction of the city gate tower and his body immediately trembled. Old Master Xia, who was sitting on the city gate tower watching the battle, had already disappeared.</p>
<p>When he turned around, he realized that Old Master Xia was already standing in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony with his hands behind his back.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was just about to forcefully break through the light barrier when he realized that it had suddenly vanished. Just as he was overjoyed and was about to rush up the Hall of Supreme Harmony, a figure appeared in front of it as though he had teleported. He stood at the end of the stairs and blocked his path.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a careful look and saw that the person’s body was majestic. He was about two meters tall and his hair was completely white. He looked like an elder, but his aura was extremely powerful. He didn’t look like an elder at all.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated as though he had sensed an extremely dangerous aura. He couldn’t help but feel alarmed.</p>
<p>“Who allowed you to destroy the array without permission?” Old Master Xia didn’t look at Zhou Wen, but his gaze landed on Xia Xuanyue.</p>
<p>“Old Master, Xuanyue didn’t do it on purpose. She just couldn’t bear to see the Xia family’s members die…” Xia Liuchuan hurriedly pulled Xia Xuanyue to kneel down and admit her mistake.</p>
<p>“Is that so?” Old Master Xia glanced expressionlessly at the Xia family members who had been drained of their vitality and had luckily escaped.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Old Master Xia extended his hand and grabbed. Xia Xuanyue’s body seemed to be grabbed by an invisible hand as she was instantly pulled in front of Old Master Xia. He had his hand on her head.</p>
<p>On the ground, the golden runes appeared once again. The array was activated again, trapping everyone inside once more.</p>
<h3 id='chapter747'>Chapter 747: Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Formation</h3>
<p>The first to bear the brunt was the Xia family members. Their Essence Energy was already depleted and they had been enervated of their essence, vitality, and spirit. With the array’s sudden suction, their bodies immediately bled as many of them collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p>Apart from Zhou Wen and Old Master Xia who weren’t affected, even Xia Xuanyue’s Essence Energy began to drain.</p>
<p>“Old Master, please let Xuanyue off. She won’t make the same mistake again,” Xia Liuchuan pleaded.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia had Xia Xuanyue’s head in one hand; yet, she couldn’t move at all. Even the Mythical sword in her hand dropped to the ground as her eyes were filled with horror.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia said calmly, “Don’t think that you can do whatever you want just because you were born into the Xia family. The world is cold and heartless. Any mistake can lead to the downfall of a family. As the future leader of the Xia family, if you don’t even understand this, you have no right to lead the Xia family.”</p>
<p>“Please give Xuanyue another chance.” Xia Liuchuan slammed his head on the ground.</p>
<p>“Rules are rules. A volcano won’t stop erupting because of your pleas, and time won’t stop flowing because of pity. Rules have no feelings, and they are the most straightforward. It looks like you still don’t understand what kind of cruel world you will face as the future leader of the Xia family.” Old Master Xia didn’t have any intention of letting Xia Xuanyue off—Xia Xuanyue’s Essence Energy was almost drained dry.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan’s body trembled as he suddenly looked up. The Evil-Slaying Sword in his hand erupted with extreme strength as he stabbed at the golden light of the array.</p>
<p>“Liuchuan!” Ah Cheng’s expression turned even uglier. He wanted to stop Xia Liuchuan, but it was already too late.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The power of the Evil-Slaying Sword and the augmentation of Xia Liuchuan’s protective armor failed to slice through the light barrier.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan was alarmed, but in the next second, the Pure Hook Sword in his other hand slashed out as well. The two swords slashed at the array in a frenzy, but it only caused the golden barrier to sway. It failed to slice through it.</p>
<p>Instead, his Essence Energy was absorbed by the array, causing the golden light barrier to become even more terrifying.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia looked at Xia Liuchuan coldly and asked, “Little Chuan, I dote on you the most. Are you going to betray me now?”</p>
<p>“I only hope that you can spare Xuanyue. She’s my sister.” Xia Liuchuan’s swords didn’t stop as he continued slashing at the barrier.</p>
<p>“Seems like I need to reconsider the heir to the Xia family.” A cold glint flashed across Old Master Xia’s eyes as he clenched his fists.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a sword beam slashed over. Old Master Xia raised his hand and grabbed it. The golden sword beam was sucked into his palm and vanished instantly. Instead, the Essence Energy on Old Master Xia’s body became even more majestic.</p>
<p>At the same time, a suction force pulled Xia Xuanyue out. It was Zhou Wen’s Demonic Astral Wheel.</p>
<p>“You people from a large family sure know how to have fun. You can even make it sound so dignified by killing your descendants. You’ve really broadened my horizons today.” Zhou Wen pulled Xia Xuanyue to his side, but she wasn’t in a good state. Her Essence Energy was constantly depleting, and she was almost drained dry.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the Heaven-Opening Scripture. The scripture floated above his head, emitting an invisible force that blocked the array’s suction force, preventing any Essence Energy in a tiny area around him from being sucked into the array.</p>
<p>“To be able to withstand the power of the Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array, your talent and the Essence Energy Art you cultivate, as well as your Life Providence and Life Soul, are indeed extraordinary.” Old Master Xia didn’t mind the sarcasm in Zhou Wen’s words. All he did was stare at the Heaven-Opening Scripture above Zhou Wen’s head and ask, “That’s your Life Soul, right? What’s its name?”</p>
<p>“Why should I tell you, you old sicko?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. Even if you don’t tell me, I’ll find out soon,” Old Master Xia said as he spread out his palm. All the Essence Energy in the Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array gathered towards his palm.</p>
<p>Instantly, there were tragic cries. Many of the Xia family disciples who were struggling died as they spat out blood. Their bodies were instantly sucked dry as they lost their essence, vitality, and spirit.</p>
<p>As for Old Master Xia, after absorbing so much Essence Energy, his aura became extremely terrifying. The Essence Energy that seeped out of his body seemed to condense into something corporeal as it swayed on his body. The cracked Essence Energy made his skin seem transparent.</p>
<p>Be it Xia Liuchuan and Ah Cheng, who were outside the Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array, or Zhou Wen and Xia Xuanyue inside the array, they all felt their blood run cold.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that they had never seen a dead person, but more than ten thousand Epic experts had died tragically. Furthermore, they were members of the Xia family. They had never seen anyone so crazy.</p>
<p>“Old Master… Why are you doing this… This is destroying the Xia family…” Xia Xuanyue really couldn’t understand why Old Master Xia would do this.</p>
<p>There were more than ten thousand Epic experts. Even among the six families, there weren’t many who could gather that number of Epic experts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they had been nurtured by Old Master Xia himself. Now, he had personally killed them. Xia Xuanyue couldn’t figure out why.</p>
<p>“With me around, the Xia family will never be destroyed. So what if there are more than ten thousand Epic experts? I spent such a huge price to nurture them. They were originally only used as a stepping stone for my advancement to the Mythical stage. Now that their mission has been completed, they have died a worthy death.” The Essence Energy in Old Master Xia’s body was as terrifying as a volcanic eruption. Furthermore, his body seemed to be becoming younger. Even his white hair was gradually turning black.</p>
<p>“Advance to the Mythical stage?” Xia Xuanyue couldn’t comprehend. Was it right to sacrifice so many people just to advance to the Mythical stage? Furthermore, among the ten thousand Epic experts, although most of them didn’t share the Xia surname, many of them were blood-related members of the Xia family.</p>
<p>“If one doesn’t enter the Mythical stage, they will ultimately be mortal. No matter how powerful they are, there will be a day when they die. Only by advancing to the Mythical stage can one break through the shackles of life-like dimensional creatures and become a higher life form… Unfortunately, the human body is too weak. Their talent is too poor. Even someone as talented as me can’t rely on the strength of a single person to advance to the Mythical stage.”</p>
<p>Old Master Xia explained indifferently, “I’ve studied many Essence Energy Arts and combined them with the Great Emperor Sutra passed down in our Xia family. I’ve finally found a path to advance to the Mythical stage. It’s to pile up sand into a tower and refine rocks into gold. I gathered the bloodlines, talents, Life Providences, and Life Souls of many geniuses into one, allowing me to break through the limits of humanity and advance to the Mythical stage. This is the only path I can take now.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was dumbfounded when he heard that. He finally knew why the Xia family had secretly attacked so many talented youths. It was all because of Old Master Xia.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that Wang Mingyuan’s advancement to the Mythical stage was already very ruthless, but compared to Old Master Xia’s method, Wang Mingyuan’s advancement was as holy as an angel.</p>
<h3 id='chapter748'>Chapter 748: Old Master Xia</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“By killing so many people, what’s the difference between you and a devil-like Jing Daoxian? Aren’t you afraid that the other five Federation families will join forces to attack you?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia sneered and said, “You killed these people. What has it got to do with me? I’ll naturally kill you to avenge them. You will also become an important step in my advancement to the Mythical stage.”</p>
<p>With that said, Old Master Xia extended his hand and grabbed at Zhou Wen and Xia Xuanyue. At the same time, he continued, “As a member of the Xia family, you should contribute to the Xia family. Return your bloodline’s talent to me.”</p>
<p>A terrifying suction force was produced as Xia Xuanyue and Zhou Wen involuntarily headed for Old Master Xia.</p>
<p>This was the first time Zhou Wen had seen a human use such terrifying strength. His strength couldn’t withstand the suction force. Together with the Heaven-Opening Scripture, he moved in Old Master Xia’s direction, his feet leaving two marks on the stone slabs on the ground.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue had expended too much Essence Energy and was in an even worse state. Her body had already flown up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen placed the log down with one hand and stabbed it into the ground. He used his other hand to hold Xia Xuanyue back and thanks to the log, they finally stopped.</p>
<p>The enemy of an enemy was a friend. Now, Xia Liuchuan and Xia Xuanyue were probably going to completely fall out with Old Master Xia. Perhaps he could use their strength later.</p>
<p>Although Xia Xuanyue no longer had any combat strength, Xia Liuchuan was still outside. Furthermore, he had a Guardian with him. Perhaps he could use his strength to rush out of the Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array.</p>
<p>Otherwise, in this array, any Companion Beast’s Essence Energy would be drained. The more Companion Beasts summoned, the stronger the augmentation Old Master Xia would receive. He had to rush out first.</p>
<p>“That old sicko has absorbed the Life Providence and Life Souls of countless geniuses. He has also absorbed the Essence Energy and life essence of more than ten thousand Epic experts. His strength is unfathomable. Speaking of which, even a tiger will not eat its cubs; yet, this old sicko wants to devour his descendants. Why doesn’t the heavens strike him to death with lightning?” Zhou Wen placed Xia Xuanyue behind the log and got her to hug it. He held the Golden Overlord Sword and slashed out sword beams at the old sicko, hoping to temporarily stop his suction force so that he could rush out of the Heaven and Earth Essence Origin-Returning Array with the log.</p>
<p>However, the Golden Sword Aura that Zhou Wen slashed out was sucked in by the old sicko. Not only did it fail to injure him, but it also became a tonic for him.</p>
<p>“I refuse to believe that you can suck everything.” Zhou Wen summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull and made it shake the Soul Suppression Bell.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>However, the Soul Suppressing Bell’s chime couldn’t stir Old Master Xia’s soul. It didn’t make him dizzy at all. Instead, as the Great Might Vajra Bull was too big in size, the power of the Heaven-Opening Scripture couldn’t envelop it completely. Its Essence Energy quickly drained as its body moved towards Old Master Xia’s palm.</p>
<p>The Great Might Vajra Bull struggled with all its might, but it was unable to stop itself from sliding towards Old Master Xia. Its four hooves sank into the stone slab, but it didn’t stop its slide towards Old Master Xia, scaring the Great Might Vajra Bull into mooing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly summoned it back and didn’t dare release it again.</p>
<p>“Don’t use Companion Beasts. He has absorbed countless Life Providences and Life Souls. He can absorb any type of Essence Energy for his own use. Companion Beasts are condensed from Essence Energy. The power of any Companion Beast will be of help to him…” Xia Liuchuan warned Zhou Wen loudly from outside.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“How can I rush out without a Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“Since you insist on dying, come in and join them.” Old Master Xia snorted coldly. Xia Liuchuan had already used his fists to strike the light barrier of the array, but he suddenly felt the area in front of him empty out. He had already fallen into the array.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia used his other hand to grab and suck at Xia Liuchuan. Xia Liuchuan’s body immediately slid towards him.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan didn’t retreat. He gritted his teeth and threw a punch at Old Master Xia.</p>
<p>Guardians were lifeforms and not pure energy. They were somewhat different from Companion Beasts. The Guardian’s strength should be able to be of some use against Old Master Xia.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Old Master Xia’s palm collided with Xia Liuchuan’s fist and was forced back a few steps. The suction force immediately vanished.</p>
<p>“I’ll hold him back. Take Xuanyue and leave.” Xia Liuchuan threw another punch at Old Master Xia and shouted.</p>
<p>“Brother, I’m counting on you.” Zhou Wen picked up the log and ran with Xia Xuanyue.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue was still somewhat hesitant, but Zhou Wen immediately said, “It’ll be easier for your brother to run if we run. If you stay a minute longer, your brother will be in greater danger.”</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue naturally understood this principle. She gritted her teeth and ran to the edge of the array formation with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen attacked the array, but when his strength struck the barrier, it was absorbed by the barrier, preventing it from cracking.</p>
<p>Essence Energy-related skills won’t do, but I wonder if pure physical strength works? Zhou Wen didn’t think too much about it as he forcefully switched to the Defy Ancient Sovereign Life Soul. He used the Demon Dragon True Body and endured the loss of Essence Energy as he threw a punch at the barrier.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The barrier trembled. Although it wasn’t shattered, it gave Zhou Wen hope. Pure physical strength was indeed effective against the Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate as he punched the barrier, again and again, hoping to penetrate it and escape the Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan was attacking Old Master Xia crazily, but all his attacks were easily dodged by Old Master Xia, like a cat teasing a mouse.</p>
<p>“I gave you everything you have, and I taught you all your techniques. How dare you attack me?” Old Master Xia easily dodged Xia Liuchuan’s attack and stared at him coldly.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan didn’t say a word and just kept attacking.</p>
<p>In the past, Old Master Xia had indeed doted on him. In the past, he had indeed treated Old Master Xia as his closest kin, even closer than his own parents.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until the year he turned fifteen that he accidentally saw Old Master Xia suck his talented cousin dry. From then on, he rarely went to the East Courtyard.</p>
<p>“I originally thought that you were a little different from the others, but it looks like you’re just a beast that will ultimately remain mortal. Forget it. With you as my last cornerstone, my raising of you for so many years wasn’t in vain.” Old Master Xia actually made a move. His palm actually passed through Xia Liuchuan’s fist and struck his chest.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan was wearing the Guardian armor. Although he wasn’t seriously injured, he still took a few steps back.</p>
<p>“Although a Guardian is strong, it’s a pity that you don’t have the time to truly control his power. Furthermore, do you really think that after contracting with the Guardian, he will really belong to you?” Old Master Xia retracted his palm. There was a wound on his finger and blood was dripping out.</p>
<p>There was also a smear of blood on Xia Liuchuan’s armor. Clearly, the blood did not belong to him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter749'>Chapter 749: The Strong Are Respected</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>The Guardian armor on Xia Liuchuan’s body cracked. It wasn’t shattering, but the armor was automatically disintegrating.</p>
<p>The black jade-like armor quickly disintegrated from Xia Liuchuan’s body and condensed into a figure in the air.</p>
<p>It was a black jade golem. It looked very strange. It had the appearance of a human, but its body was black jade.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia looked at Xia Liuchuan and said coldly, “In this world, only strength is the eternal truth. The so-called Guardian only wants to protect humans who can make it stronger. I’m far stronger than you, so it abandoned you and chose me. The rules of the world are just that cruel. The strong are respected.”</p>
<p>As Old Master Xia spoke, the black-jade-like Guardian had already transformed into armor again. However, this time, it was on Old Master Xia.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia’s white hair had already turned completely black. Wearing the black jade Guardian armor, he looked even more majestic and heroic. His nose was slightly aquiline, giving him the look of the ruthlessness of an ambitious and ruthless character. It made people fear him.</p>
<p>Without the protection of the black jade armor, Xia Liuchuan’s Essence Energy began to leak out as it was absorbed by the Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia already had terrifying Essence Energy and vitality. Now, with the power of the black jade armor, his strength was unimaginable. With a punch, Xia Liuchuan only had time to raise his arm to block before he was sent flying. He slammed into the light barrier and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still striking the barrier, but he hadn’t blasted it open. When he turned his head and saw this scene, he was somewhat alarmed.</p>
<p>Although I knew that Guardians are unreliable, I never expected them to be so unreliable. It actually betrayed its owner just like that. Thankfully, I didn’t contract a Guardian. Zhou Wen was secretly glad that he didn’t contract with Guardians.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen secretly decided that unless it was a master-slave contract like Demonic Neonate, even if he couldn’t advance to the Mythical stage, he definitely wouldn’t contract a Guardian.</p>
<p>Now, there was no time for Zhou Wen to think too much. Xia Liuchuan was already at his limits. If he didn’t leave, he would only be able to fight Old Sicko Xia in the Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array. Fighting him here would be too disadvantageous.</p>
<p>However, the barrier was too hard. The power of the Demon Dragon True Body couldn’t blast it open in a short period of time. By the time he blasted it open, Old Sicko Xia would have already charged over.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen thought of an idea. Although he didn’t know if it would work, he had to give it a try.</p>
<p>Looking at Xia Xuanyue, who had expended all her Essence Energy and was losing her essence, vitality, and spirit, Zhou Wen switched to the Dao Sutra and summoned the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder to protect himself and Xia Xuanyue. Then, he hugged the log to his waist and slammed it into the light barrier of the Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array.</p>
<p>I’ve carried you for so long. If you don’t give me some help, I’m going to die here, Zhou Wen thought as the log slammed into the barrier.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to try using the heavy mass of the log to aid him, but to his surprise, he heard a loud thud.</p>
<p>The entire Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array’s barrier shattered like glass. It stopped operating as the golden runes beneath dimmed.</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned as Old Master Xia gave up on attacking Xia Liuchuan. He turned his head and looked at Zhou Wen, staring at the log in his arms with a puzzled look.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue, who was sitting beside him, looked at Zhou Wen with a look of surprise. She never expected Zhou Wen to crack the Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen never expected the log to be so powerful. If he had known this would happen, he would have long cracked open the Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array. He wouldn’t have needed to wait until now.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t waste any time being dazed. He ran towards the Hall of Supreme Harmony with the log in hand.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia’s figure moved as he attempted to stop Zhou Wen. Although he didn’t know what Zhou Wen was up to, he didn’t think it was anything good, nor did he wish for anything to happen.</p>
<p>Just as he moved, he saw a sword beam stab at him. Old Master Xia dodged slightly and the Evil-Slaying Sword flew past his face. Xia Liuchuan held the Pure Hook Sword with both hands and cleaved down from behind.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia snorted and flicked the Pure Hook Sword with his finger, sending it flying.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan’s figure appeared beside the Evil-Slaying Sword that had already flown over. He held onto the Evil-Slaying Sword and slashed at Old Master Xia’s neck.</p>
<p>“I told you, I taught you everything. Your tricks are useless against me.” Old Master Xia seemed to have expected Xia Liuchuan to appear there and punched him in the abdomen.</p>
<p>This punch carried unparalleled power. If one was hit, even a steel castle would be blasted open, much less a person. It was evident that Old Master Xia really wanted to kill Xia Liuchuan.</p>
<p>However, Xia Liuchuan’s person disappeared again. Old Master Xia’s fist missed again.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>A sword stabbed into Old Master Xia’s back. It was the ancient sword that Xia Xuanyue used. At that moment, Xia Liuchuan held it in his hand and pierced through Old Master Xia’s black jade armor.</p>
<p>“Very good… Really good… I never expected your Sword Warp technique to reach such a stage. You can use the sword of others to warp. From the looks of it, you never planned on following my orders to kill Zhou Wen from the beginning…” Old Master Xia lowered his head as his eyes turned terrifying. Without turning around, he enunciated each word with a heavy tone.</p>
<p>The ancient sword had penetrated three inches in and the sword beam erupted like a volcano. However, no matter how Xia Liuchuan exerted his strength, he was unable to move the sword tip any further.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia’s figure suddenly turned blurry and vanished in front of Xia Liuchuan as though he had teleported. Xia Liuchuan cursed silently and used Sword Warp. When he appeared again, he was already beside the Evil-Slaying Sword.</p>
<p>However, just as Xia Liuchuan appeared, Old Master Xia appeared beside the Evil-Slaying Sword and punched him to the ground.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan’s body slammed heavily to the ground, creating a huge crater. Blood spewed out of his mouth as countless bones fractured.</p>
<p>“Brother!” Xia Xuanyue struggled to stand up and wanted to rush over.</p>
<p>“Don’t come over… Leave quickly…” Xia Liuchuan gritted his teeth and shouted. At the same time, he used Sword Warp with all his might again. When he arrived beside the Pure Hook Sword, his body clearly staggered, but his grip on the sword remained immensely firm.</p>
<p>However, the moment he held the Pure Hook Sword, Old Master Xia had already appeared in front of him. Without waiting for Xia Liuchuan to swing his sword, his fists had already struck Xia Liuchuan’s chest at an indiscernible speed. Xia Liuchuan vomited blood and his sternum collapsed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter750'>Chapter 750: Freakish Monster</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>While Xia Liuchuan held back Old Master Xia, Zhou Wen finally reached the top of the Hall of Supreme Harmony’s roof. When he raised the log to the highest point, Zhou Wen knew that he was at the right spot.</p>
<p>After the log was erected on the roof, it seemed to be sucked by a magnet. Zhou Wen didn’t need to support it to prevent it from falling.</p>
<p>It’s done! Zhou Wen was delighted as he took two steps back. The word “slave” didn’t appear on his forehead again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to see what changes the log had undergone because Xia Liuchuan was about to be sucked dry.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia’s hand grabbed Xia Liuchuan’s head, causing his Essence Energy, essence, vitality, and spirit to rush into Old Master Xia’s body.</p>
<p>Originally, Xia Liuchuan’s life had nothing to do with Zhou Wen, but if he allowed Old Master Xia to absorb Xia Liuchuan’s powers to advance to the Mythical stage, it would be even harder to deal with him.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if Xia Liuchuan hadn’t held back Old Master Xia just now, it would have been very difficult for him to escape Old Master Xia and erect the log above the Hall of Supreme Harmony.</p>
<p>Without the restriction of the log, Zhou Wen felt much more relaxed. Doctor Darkness possessed him as he drew Bamboo Blade. He used Transcendent Flying Immortal and instantly appeared in front of Old Master Xia and slashed at his hand that was grabbing Xia Liuchuan.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia’s other hand blocked the Bamboo Blade at the last moment.</p>
<p>With the protection of the black jade armor, Bamboo Blade failed to injure his hand. However, this was within Zhou Wen’s expectations. He held the Orchid Blade in his other hand and slashed at Old Master Xia’s neck from a strange angle.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia had no choice but to let go of Xia Liuchuan and grab the Orchid Blade with his other hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s movement technique changed as he danced in the air, preventing Old Master Xia’s hand from touching his saber. With one long and one short blade in hand, he slashed at Old Master Xia from all sorts of strange angles.</p>
<p>He didn’t dare use his Essence Energy Skills and only relied on his strength to attack. Although the Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array had been destroyed, Old Master Xia had the ability to absorb all sorts of Essence Energy. Even an Essence Energy Skill with powerful offensive strength like the Golden Sword Aura would be directly absorbed by him and augment him. The other Essence Energy Skills were even more useless.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen was best at movement techniques. He didn’t need to release his Essence Energy, or he would have been sucked in by Old Master Xia.</p>
<p>Outside Forbidden City, Zhang Chunqiu and Dugu Ge were already dumbfounded. With the Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array enveloping the area, they had no idea what was happening inside.</p>
<p>After the array was destroyed by Zhou Wen, they could finally see the situation inside.</p>
<p>However, they ended up seeing that Xia Liuchuan had been beaten up by Old Master Xia and how Zhou Wen had helped to resolve the situation and was fighting Old Master Xia. In addition, more than ten thousand Xia family members had collapsed to the ground. It left them momentarily shocked, unsure of what had happened.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pushed Transcendent Flying Immortal to its limits. With Doctor Darkness strengthening his body, his speed was much faster than a Mythical creature like Six-Winged.</p>
<p>However, his two sabers did not touch Old Master Xia at all.</p>
<p>Path to Snatching Heaven! Zhou Wen recognized that the movement technique Old Master Xia was using was the Path to Snatching Heaven.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t find it strange that Old Master Xia could use Path to Snatching Heaven. Furthermore, Old Master Xia’s Path to Snatching Heaven was stronger than Xia Xuanyue’s. Clearly, he had long cultivated it to the divine level.</p>
<p>However, this movement technique was somewhat different from Xia Xuanyue’s—it was several times stronger. Even Zhou Wen’s divine Transcendent Flying Immortal paled in comparison.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that not only did Old Master Xia have a good movement technique, but he seemed to have made terrifying achievements in his various techniques. Every ordinary move was like a finishing touch. It was as if every move had reached a divine level.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was completely suppressed in a short period of time. Be it in terms of technique or strength, he was unable to fight Old Master Xia head-on.</p>
<p>If not for the fact that he already knew the profundity of the Path to Snatching Heaven, he would have been injured by Old Master Xia.</p>
<p>With his understanding of Path to Snatching Heaven and the wonders of Transcendent Flying Immortal, Zhou Wen was barely able to maintain an undefeated stance.</p>
<p>This sicko is a monster. How can someone cultivate all the techniques to the divine level? Is he still human? Zhou Wen knew very well how difficult it was to cultivate a technique to the divine level.</p>
<p>After cultivating for so long, he had only cultivated Transcendent Flying Immortal to the divine level. Xia Liuchuan was about ten years older than him, but he had also only cultivated Sword Warp to the divine level.</p>
<p>As for Old Master Xia, he gave Zhou Wen the feeling that he was omnipotent. It was as though any technique would become an unparalleled divine technique in his hands.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t use any Essence Energy Skills, he was already suffocating from the pressure.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen was a person who was calmer and less prone to mistakes in times of adversity. He kept searching for an opportunity to defeat Old Master Xia.</p>
<p>Typical Companion Beast attacks weren’t of much use against someone like Old Master Xia who could absorb Essence Energy Skills. Physical attacks were relatively effective against him.</p>
<p>However, now that he had the Guardian armor, he was like a tiger with wings. Typical Mythical Companion Beasts were probably not a threat to him.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth was originally a better choice. Unfortunately, its Absolute Strength had run out not long ago, so it couldn’t be used for the time being.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that among his Companion Beasts, the only ones that might pose a threat to Old Master Xia were Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World, Demonic Neonate’s Demonic Sword, and Truth Listener that had activated multiple earrings.</p>
<p>However, they might only be effective and not necessarily useful. Therefore, Zhou Wen had to find an appropriate opportunity to use Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch World. He only hoped to kill Old Master Xia in one strike and not give him any chance.</p>
<p>His flesh tore as Old Master Xia’s fingertip brushed past Zhou Wen’s arm. Immediately, his flesh was sliced open and blood flowed out. If Zhou Wen had dodged any slower, his arm would have been severed.</p>
<p>To fight someone whose movement techniques weren’t slower than them, whose attacks were more ruthless than them, and whose moves were more ingenious than them, anyone would feel immense pressure. If they weren’t careful, they might be killed in one strike.</p>
<p>In reality, there was no rewind option like in-game, so Zhou Wen didn’t dare be careless. He would rather be injured than take the risk of being killed in one strike.</p>
<p>“You are indeed different from the rest. I wouldn’t be surprised if I saw such a movement technique and endurance from an old man in his seventies or eighties, but you are only seventeen or eighteen years old. To be able to do this much, your future achievements will definitely not be inferior to An Tianzuo’s if you don’t die,” Old Master Xia said calmly as he attacked.</p>
<p>Actually, he shouldn’t be called Old Master Xia anymore because his current appearance was almost the same as a man in his thirties. There were no signs of aging on his body.</p>
<p>His majestic figure, domineering aura, and invincible combat strength made him seem invulnerable.</p>
<p>Blood splattered as another wound appeared on Zhou Wen’s back.</p>
<p>“I’ll help you.” Xia Liuchuan struggled to stand up, but his injuries were too serious. He staggered as he walked. Only his hand that held the sword remained steady.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan wanted to throw his sword at Old Master Xia, but before he could do so, Old Master Xia had already struck out with his palm, sending Xia Liuchuan flying along with his sword.</p>
<p>Now. Zhou Wen instantly unleashed his strength. He pushed Transcendent Flying Immortal to its limits as the two blades transformed into streams of light that criss-crossed with Old Master Xia.</p>
<h3 id='chapter751'>Chapter 751: Connate Dominance Body</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>The fully-unleashed Transcendent Flying Immortal was blocked by Old Master Xia’s hands.</p>
<p>The divine physique given to him by the Guardian, together with the powerful Essence Energy he had accumulated, was truly terrifying.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no intention of finishing Old Master Xia off with this strike. As the two sabers slashed crazily, Torch Dragon’s mirror eye also caused Zhou Wen’s pupils to undergo a strange change. It was as though it had turned into a mirror as it looked at Old Master Xia.</p>
<p>However, Old Master Xia suddenly vanished into thin air. Almost at the same time, he appeared behind Zhou Wen and struck his head with his palm.</p>
<p>Teleportation! Zhou Wen immediately realized that it was true teleportation. It had an extremely similar effect to Lost Country.</p>
<p>Without any time to turn around or dodge, Zhou Wen raised Bamboo Blade above his head and blocked Old Master Xia’s palm.</p>
<p>However, the palm strangely turned transparent as though it had transformed into a ghostly hand. It passed through the Bamboo Blade and continued striking at Zhou Wen’s head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed as he twisted his head to the side. He gathered his strength with his other hand and struck towards Old Master Xia’s palm.</p>
<p>When the two palms clashed, Zhou Wen immediately felt a powerful suction force suck his palm, sucking the Essence Energy in his body towards Old Master Xia.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to shake off Old Master Xia’s hand, but he couldn’t. His other hand held Bamboo Blade and slashed at Old Master Xia, but he was grabbed by his other hand. His Essence Energy was sucked even faster.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately realized the problem. Not only had Old Master Xia absorbed the Essence Energy of those geniuses, but he had also robbed them of their bloodline talent, Life Providence, and Life Soul.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was certain that Old Master Xia definitely had multiple Life Providences and Life Souls. Otherwise, it was impossible for him to use so many different Essence Energy Skills.</p>
<p>In that short moment, Old Master Xia had used three powers of different attributes and categories. Furthermore, each of them was a rare ability.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy was drained as his expression turned livid. He suddenly activated his mirror eye and looked at Old Master Xia.</p>
<p>“Don’t use the same trick twice in front of me,” Old Master Xia said coldly. He opened his eyes and there seemed to be a devil roaring in his pupils. It was an eye-type Life Soul.</p>
<p>At the instant he saw the Life Soul in the eye, Zhou Wen’s eyelids closed uncontrollably. He couldn’t open them no matter what.</p>
<p>How many terrifying Life Providences and Life Souls did this bastard plunder? How did he do it? Zhou Wen was alarmed as the Essence Energy in his body surged towards Old Master Xia like a river.</p>
<p>I’ll fight it out with you. Zhou Wen struggled with all his might, hoping to escape Old Master Xia’s grasp, but it was to no avail.</p>
<p>Just as Old Master Xia was about to say something, a purple-black ancient sword suddenly emerged from the ground and stabbed at Old Master Xia’s crotch.</p>
<p>This strike was too strange and sinister. Before Old Master Xia could react, the sword had already stabbed into his body.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>After being penetrated by the demonic sword, Old Master Xia’s body exploded like a ball of water, turning into a pool of water. As for his true body, it appeared behind Zhou Wen and twisted his arms.</p>
<p>He even has an avatar Life Soul. This old sicko… Zhou Wen cursed inwardly.</p>
<p>“No matter how strong you are, you’re just a…” Before Old Master Xia could finish his sentence, his pupils constricted.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s right hand, which he had grabbed, suddenly vanished like a ghost. It passed through Old Master Xia’s Guardian armor and body and instantly flashed three times.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of having his Essence Energy sucked away. His Slaughterer Life Soul allowed him to have unlimited Essence Energy. No matter how much Old Master Xia absorbed, it wouldn’t harm him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had waited so long for this opportunity. When Old Master Xia believed that he was at the end of his rope and his final trump card had failed, he used Doctor Darkness’s Darkness Right Hand.</p>
<p>Without giving Old Master Xia any chance, Zhou Wen’s Darkness Right Hand plucked out Old Master Xia’s heart, liver, and one of his kidneys. Even the Guardian armor couldn’t block the Darkness Right Hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held Old Master Xia’s bloody organs in his hand. The heart was still beating violently. Every time it beat, blood would spew out from the severed arteries. It looked extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia looked down at his body and didn’t find any injuries. However, blood seeped out from his mouth and nose.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan and Xia Xuanyue watched this scene with mixed feelings.</p>
<p>“It’s been a long time… It’s been a long time since someone injured me… You are the first in nearly twenty years…” Old Master Xia said as he stared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately felt that something was amiss. Old Master Xia’s vitality didn’t weaken after his organs were removed. Instead, it became stronger.</p>
<p>A white flame burned over Old Master Xia’s body. It wasn’t a flame, but a condensation of immense lifeforce.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used his penetrative vision to stare at Old Master Xia and saw that the organs that had been plucked out of his body had grown again.</p>
<p>“Connate Dominance Body… How is this possible… This is impossible…” Xia Xuanyue exclaimed.</p>
<p>“What is the Connate Dominance Body?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>The heavily injured Xia Liuchuan answered, “The Connate Dominance Body is a Life Providence derived from the Invincible Connate Divine Art. Only by cultivating the Invincible Connate Divine Art can one condense a Connate Dominance Body. However, not everyone who cultivates the Invincible Connate Divine Art can condense a Connate Dominance Body. It depends on one’s physique and talent. Our Xia family abandoned the Invincible Connate Divine Art long ago. The only person in the records who could condense a Connate Dominance Body was our Xia family’s hero… However, he died many years ago…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had heard of the Xia family’s hero. As Li Xuan cultivated in the Invincible Connate Divine Art, he had heard a lot about it from him.</p>
<p>However, in Zhou Wen’s impression, the Xia family’s hero’s Life Providence didn’t seem to be called the Connate Dominance Body. Furthermore, in order to get married and have children, he had nullified the Invincible Connate Divine Art. He had lost both his Life Providence and Life Soul. Even if he revived, it was impossible for him to have another Connate Dominance Body.</p>
<p>It was also because of this that the Xia family’s hero died in a dimensional zone.</p>
<p>However, Xia Liuchuan and Xia Xuanyue were real Xia family members. They naturally wouldn’t make a mistake. Old Master Xia definitely had the Connate Dominance Body.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, he has absorbed a Xia family member with a Connate Dominance Body Life Providence,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That’s impossible. Apart from the Xia family’s hero, even if one cultivates in the Invincible Connate Divine Art, no one has condensed a Connate Dominance Body…” Xia Xuanyue said.</p>
<p>“Then you must be mistaken. What he has isn’t the Connate Dominance Body, but another powerful self-healing ability…” Zhou Wen saw that Old Master Xia’s body had already recovered. After his organs were regenerated, they were no different from his previous organs.</p>
<h3 id='chapter752'>Chapter 752: Dark Clouds</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Old Master Xia clearly wasn’t in the mood to continue listening to them. With a flash, he appeared in front of Zhou Wen like a devil and struck out at him.</p>
<p>The flames on his palm were like a blazing sun that burned everything. When Zhou Wen saw that the flames could even burn through the void, he immediately knew that it wasn’t an ordinary fire-elemental power. He didn’t dare take it head-on as he spread out his six wings and rapidly retreated.</p>
<p>However, a pair of Golden-Winged Roc Life Soul wings appeared behind Old Master Xia, greatly increasing his speed. Zhou Wen wasn’t able to open the distance between them, so the flames were about to strike his chest.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to slash out his Bamboo Blade at Old Master Xia’s palm.</p>
<p>When Bamboo Blade came into contact with the flames, the flames spread along Bamboo Blade and instantly enveloped his body.</p>
<p>The flames spewed out before extinguishing. The six wings on Zhou Wen’s back vanished as his face turned pale.</p>
<p>If not for Six-Winged’s Life Guardian, Zhou Wen would have died from this strike.</p>
<p>However, Six-Winged was also killed because of this, making it impossible for it to be revived.</p>
<p>“To think you have a Companion Beast that can die in your place. Your luck sure is extraordinary. However, your luck ends here.” Old Master Xia stared coldly at Zhou Wen, prepared to continue attacking.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a clap of thunder sounded in the sky, shocking everyone.</p>
<p>At some point in time, the sky was filled with dark clouds. Lightning flashed amidst the dark clouds.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu, who was peeping outside, felt a sharp pain in his eyes. Blood tears flowed out of his eyes as he hurriedly retracted his Heavenly Eye. He didn’t dare look inside again as he looked at Forbidden City’s general direction in horror.</p>
<p>A storm was brewing above Forbidden City. The whole of Imperial Capital’s sky was covered in dark clouds, but Forbidden City seemed to be the center of the storm. It was especially gloomy.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, Dugu Ge lost contact with his Gu worm. The two of them looked at each other and saw the shock in each other’s eyes.</p>
<p>Up to now, they had yet to figure out what had happened in Forbidden City. They had some ideas based on what they had seen, but they didn’t know if they were right. However, just the mere speculation left them shocked.</p>
<p>“Do you know what’s going on?” Dugu Ge pointed at the dark clouds in the sky and asked.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu pinched his fingers to divine. The more he did so, the more he shook his head. “The heavenly secrets are in chaos. Nothing can be divined. The outcome is different every time, so there’s no point in divining. From the looks of it, something big is about to happen. Let’s leave this place quickly to avoid being implicated.”</p>
<p>“What about Loser?” Dugu Ge asked.</p>
<p>“I’ve previously told his fortune. He’s not destined to die. He should be able to survive this calamity.” As Zhang Chunqiu spoke, he turned around and left, as though he was being chased by a dog. He was afraid that he would be bitten by a dog if he ran too slowly.</p>
<p>Dugu Ge glanced in the direction of Forbidden City before leaving with Zhang Chunqiu.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In Forbidden City, Zhou Wen summoned Torch Dragon and said to Xia Xuanyue and company, “Leave now.”</p>
<p>He knew that he could only risk his life. Otherwise, he might really not be able to leave Forbidden City today.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suspected that the Old Master Xia in front of him might be one of the six heroes, the invincible hero from the Xia family.</p>
<p>However, the Xia family’s hero had long lost his virginity. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be the Xia family now.</p>
<p>Wait, what if the present Xia family doesn’t have the true hero’s bloodline? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he suddenly felt that it was very possible.</p>
<p>As the saying went, even a vicious tiger wouldn’t eat its cubs. However, Old Master Xia was as cold-blooded and heartless to the Xia family. If they went against him in any way, he would kill them immediately. Even geniuses like Xia Xuanyue and Xia Liuchuan could be ruthlessly killed. This was definitely not something an ordinary person could do.</p>
<p>However, if Old Master Xia was really the hero of the Xia family and he hadn’t really lost his virginity, then all of this could be explained. This was because the Xia family didn’t have the bloodline of the hero, so he didn’t need to have any familial concerns.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this was just Zhou Wen’s guess. Perhaps Old Master Xia had nothing to do with the Xia family’s hero. His nature was just that ruthless.</p>
<p>“Ah Cheng, take Little Chuan and Little Yue back,” Old Master Xia said as he stared coldly at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>He wasn’t killing Xia Liuchuan and Xia Xuanyue out of goodwill; instead, the array’s destruction meant he couldn’t prevent outsiders from spying on them. He wasn’t willing to kill Xia Liuchuan and Xia Xuanyue in front of others.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Ah Cheng ran towards Xia Liuchuan and Xia Xuanyue.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t stop him. Xia Liuchuan and Xia Xuanyue being taken away was better than them dying here. As long as they weren’t dead, there was still hope.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, live on,” Xia Xuanyue shouted at Zhou Wen as she was taken away.</p>
<p>I’ll live, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia glanced at Torch Dragon and said, “This should be Torch Dragon from the Zhuolu temple, right? At such a young age, you actually have so many Mythical Companion Beasts and have such attainments in martial arts. It’s enough for you to dominate the Federation. In the history of the Federation, there’s no one who had such achievements at your age.”</p>
<p>“I’m still inferior to you,” Zhou Wen said sincerely.</p>
<p>He originally believed that he was sufficiently omnipotent and could handle all kinds of crises.</p>
<p>Even if he was inferior to others in some aspects, Zhou Wen had always felt that he was one of the best in the Federation when it came to overall combat strength.</p>
<p>However, Old Master Xia was more comprehensive than him. Not only did he have multiple Life Providences and Life Souls, but he could also use them freely. He also had a Guardian. What was even more terrifying was that he didn’t plan on purely relying on the Guardian’s powers to stay at the Mythical stage. Instead, he wanted to advance to the Mythical stage with his own strength.</p>
<p>He had divine skills and immense strength. Furthermore, he definitely had Mythical Companion Beasts which were definitely not ordinary ones. His strength could be described as unfathomable.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The lightning in the sky constantly interweaved as thunder boomed one after another.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan and Xia Xuanyue no longer had the ability to fight. They were forcefully taken out by Ah Cheng. Only Zhou Wen and Old Master Xia were left in front of the huge Hall of Supreme Harmony.</p>
<p>“You are indeed inferior to me now, but if we were born in the same era, I might not be your match. With you as the last cornerstone of my advancement to the Mythical stage, I’m very satisfied. Don’t worry. After today, I’ll take your talent, Life Providence, and Life Soul for myself and make it famous. You should be able to feel comforted in the afterlife,” Old Master Xia said as he took a step forward and arrived in front of Zhou Wen as though he had tunneled through the void.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already prepared as he put on the Jade Crystal Spirit armor. At the same time, Torch Dragon used World King Transformation. Torch Dragon’s eyes all across its body opened wide as they turned into mirrors. It was the Bright Torch Vision World in the World King Transformation state.</p>
<h3 id='chapter753'>Chapter 753: Invisibility Strike</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The power of the Bright Torch Vision World enveloped the entire area.</p>
<p>However, at the instant the Bright Torch Vision World activated, Old Master Xia suddenly vanished. Truth Listener couldn’t sense his location within its range, making Zhou Wen feel uneasy.</p>
<p>When the power of the Bright Torch Vision World stopped, he saw Old Master Xia’s figure appear not far from him as though he had never moved.</p>
<p>“Universe Shifting, Yin and Yang Interconnect. There aren’t many abilities that can achieve this level. I only obtained the Yin Yang Universe Ring Life Soul after searching for nearly ten years. Using this Life Soul, I can temporarily reverse Yin and Yang, preventing any force from injuring or seeing me,” Old Master Xia said calmly as he stroked the ring with a Taiji symbol on his finger.</p>
<p>“How many people have you killed and how many Life Souls have you plundered? Don’t you think that those Life Souls are like the ghosts of those people, pestering you every day and night?” Zhou Wen unsummoned Torch Dragon to prevent it from being killed by Old Master Xia.</p>
<p>After the World King Transformation, Torch Dragon entered a weakened state, greatly reducing its strength. It could no longer play a decisive role in such a battle.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia said calmly, “In this era, if I’m still afraid of the supernatural, how can I defy the heavens and change my fate? I’m not afraid of ghosts or gods. I’m afraid I won’t be able to make all dimensional creatures prostrate before me.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“It’s about time. As one of the nine main Life Souls of the Connate Great Emperor Sutra, help me advance to the Mythical stage.” The black jade armor on Old Master Xia’s body emitted a terrifying black light. As Old Master Xia threw a punch, space tore apart, forming a black sun.</p>
<p>However, upon careful inspection, the black sun was a black hole. It produced a huge suction force that pulled Zhou Wen in.</p>
<p>As Old Master Xia blasted the black hole at Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen felt the suction force grow stronger, as though it was about to pull his soul in.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s figure flashed as he suddenly vanished.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia frowned slightly as he looked around, but he didn’t find Zhou Wen. It was as though he had vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>Almost instantly, Old Master Xia condensed a ball of sun-like radiance in his palm. The light illuminated all of Forbidden City. Wherever it shone, hot smoke would emit. No matter where one hid, they would be forced out by this indiscriminate attack.</p>
<p>However, Old Master Xia didn’t sense anything amiss as though Zhou Wen had really vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>Does he have an ability similar to the Yin Yang Universe Ring? Old Master Xia frowned slightly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally didn’t have the Yin Yang Universe Ring, but he had the Invisibility Cloak. With the Invisibility Cloak’s Wheel of Destiny activated, he had three minutes of complete invisibility. Attacks were useless against him.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen used the Invisibility Cloak, he unsummoned Demonic Neonate, who was hiding behind the roof of the Hall of Supreme Harmony, and charged towards the entrance of Forbidden City.</p>
<p>The invisible ability could only last for three minutes. After three minutes, he could only remain physically invisible. That way, he would be easily discovered. Therefore, Zhou Wen wanted to use this time to escape Forbidden City.</p>
<p>However, when he rushed to the entrance of Forbidden City, he realized that the door had already closed.</p>
<p>However, the invisibility force made him invisible and intangible during the three minutes. He could directly penetrate matter as Zhou Wen charged straight for the door.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body was repelled by a strange force, preventing him from rushing out.</p>
<p>How did this happen? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>The force that repelled him wasn’t the door itself, but a force that resembled lightning. His body was still feeling numb.</p>
<p>The black clouds and lightning that filled the sky had already made Zhou Wen feel that something was amiss. It felt even more so now. Zhou Wen looked up and carefully observed Forbidden City. He realized that the Corner Tower on the city wall was emitting a faint glow. Although the light wasn’t strong, it was especially eye-catching with the dark clouds covering the sun.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen flew into the air and looked at the other three Corner Towers in the city. Indeed, they were glowing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to think about the reason. He didn’t have much time left. It had been nearly twenty seconds since he rushed over. Since he couldn’t leave now, Zhou Wen had to think of a way to kill Old Master Xia. Otherwise, he would be the one to die.</p>
<p>The Connate Dominance Body is probably similar to Li Xuan’s Immortal God of Combat. Its self-healing ability is even stronger. It’s probably very difficult to kill him by simply injuring his body. How can I kill him? Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss, but he couldn’t sit idle.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>He quickly rushed towards Old Master Xia who was still standing in his spot. He used all sorts of methods to find Zhou Wen, but it wasn’t of much use. The eight Life Providences and Life Souls he already had, as well as all sorts of Essence Energy Skills, failed to be of any use. He failed to find the invisible Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen came in front of Old Master Xia and pointed at his mouth. Then, he summoned the Primordial Spore and allowed it to enter his body. Regardless of whether it was useful or not, he had to give it a try.</p>
<p>After the Primordial Spore entered Old Master Xia’s body, Zhou Wen pulled out the Orchid Blade and released it from invisibility. He stabbed it into Old Master Xia’s mouth.</p>
<p>The Orchid Blade entered his mouth and penetrated Old Master Xia’s brain, but it couldn’t penetrate his skull from the other end.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t care as he twisted the Orchid Blade.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia’s strength erupted like a volcano, sending Zhou Wen flying. He didn’t even manage to pull the Orchid Blade out from his mouth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body tumbled in the air as he finally managed to dissipate the terrifying force. However, he still spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t concerned about his injuries. Such injuries couldn’t kill him. All he wanted to know was if this strike was of any use.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia stood there with the Orchid Blade in his mouth. His brain had been severely damaged by Zhou Wen, but when Zhou Wen looked at him, he saw Old Master Xia extend his palm, grab the Orchid Blade, and pull it out of his mouth.</p>
<p>As for his injuries, they were rapidly recovering.</p>
<p>How can he still self-heal like this? Zhou Wen’s heart chilled. He still couldn’t kill Old Master Xia despite delivering such an attack. He couldn’t think of any power that could kill him.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia held the Orchid Blade, but there was no anger in his eyes. Instead, there was some fanaticism. “You really surprise me. Although I haven’t advanced to the Mythical stage, with the augmentation of a Guardian, I’m already a Mythical creature. Furthermore, I’m much stronger than ordinary Mythical creatures. Under such circumstances, you can still injure me, and not just once. It’s enough to prove that your Life Providence and Life Soul are very powerful.</p>
<p>“However, this also means that after absorbing your talent, Life Providence, and Life Soul, I will become stronger after advancing to the Mythical stage. I should be thanking you.” Old Master Xia walked towards Zhou Wen step by step, his killing intent burning to the extreme.</p>
<h3 id='chapter754'>Chapter 754: Connate Great Emperor Sutra</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen stood up and stared at Old Master Xia. He silently switched his Essence Energy Art to the most primitive Slaughterer and used Sigh of the King’s power.</p>
<p>Immediately, an explosive force filled his body, almost blasting it apart. Furthermore, the force was rapidly becoming stronger.</p>
<p>It had been a long time since Zhou Wen used the Sigh of the King’s power. This was because the force was just too powerful. Even with his present Constitution, he couldn’t last long. If time went on, he would explode from his own strength without the enemy doing a thing.</p>
<p>But at this stage, he had to use it no matter what.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia’s figure flashed as he appeared in front of Zhou Wen as though he had teleported. The Orchid Blade in his hand stabbed at Zhou Wen’s eyes. Even at the Mythical stage, his speed was extremely terrifying. It was almost impossible for anyone to react.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen reacted in time. His Bamboo Blade struck the Orchid Blade and forced Old Master Xia to take half a step back. It left Old Master Xia’s eyes filled with surprise.</p>
<p>With the augmentation of the Guardian, his Speed and Strength were at the Mythical stage. Furthermore, he was a top existence among Mythical creatures.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had actually blocked his saber and sent him retreating. This was enough to shock him.</p>
<p>After all, Zhou Wen didn’t have a Guardian. Even if he had a Mythical Companion Beast, that didn’t make him a true Mythical.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to think too much. His body was swelling uncomfortably, and it wouldn’t be long before he exploded. He had to do something before his body failed to withstand the Sigh of the King’s power.</p>
<p>He slashed at Old Master Xia with Bamboo Blade like a tsunami.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia raised the Orchid Blade and absorbed the terrifying Essence Energy from the Bamboo Blade.</p>
<p>However, he was surprised to discover that the Essence Energy from the Bamboo Blade seemed endless. No matter how he absorbed it, the Essence Energy from the Bamboo Blade showed no signs of weakening.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen delivered a few consecutive strikes that sent Old Master Xia retreating. The strength multiplied with every strike.</p>
<p>How is this possible? Old Master Xia was alarmed. He had the augmentation of a Guardian. Together with the power of the Connate Great Emperor Sutra, there weren’t many who could compete with him even at the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was at the Epic stage, but the power he unleashed was able to suppress him. This left him shocked and delighted.</p>
<p>The stronger Zhou Wen was, the stronger the Wheel of Destiny he would condense when he advanced to the Mythical stage with the help of the nine Life Souls.</p>
<p>“Show me your strength. This is your life’s final moment of glory. Let me see how strong you are.” Old Master Xia’s figure flashed as he dodged Zhou Wen’s saber attacks, the excitement in his eyes intensifying.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression didn’t change. Now, he was completely focused on combat. He didn’t have any other thoughts as he drove the violent forces in his body to the limits.</p>
<p>The blade became faster and faster, and the force became more and more violent.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Wen’s saber techniques, they also became stronger.</p>
<p>Transcendent Flying Immortal was actually a movement technique, not a saber technique. The present Zhou Wen was unable to injure Old Master Xia with Transcendent Flying Immortal alone as the latter’s Path to Snatching Heaven wasn’t inferior to Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen could only seek a breakthrough. Since his movement technique couldn’t threaten Old Master Xia, he could only make the saber in his hand faster and stronger.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to use many fancy moves. He was only pursuing faster speeds.</p>
<p>Quick! Quick! Quick!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only aimed to increase his speed. Be it his movement technique or the blade in his hand, they had infinite possibilities due to the nearly infinite forces in his body.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen felt that his body was about to explode from the violent forces, he finally reached a point where even Old Master Xia couldn’t dodge his attacks. He slashed at Old Master Xia’s chest.</p>
<p>However, Old Master Xia’s body exploded like water. He had only slashed at a clone—Old Master Xia’s body had appeared elsewhere.</p>
<p>“How interesting. Your Epic body actually possesses such immense strength. However, your body shouldn’t be able to withstand such immense strength, right?” Old Master Xia sized up Zhou Wen with a fervent gaze.</p>
<p>He wanted to know how strong he would be if his Mythical body could possess such power.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia carefully selected seven talented youths and plundered their talent, Life Providences, and Life Souls. Together with his Life Providence and Life Soul, he was just short of one Life Providence and Life Soul to reach the extremity of nine for the Connate Great Emperor Sutra, allowing him to change his fate and advance to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>The Connate Great Emperor Sutra was created by combining the Xia family’s Great Emperor Sutra and the Invincible Connate Divine Art he obtained from the Connate Divine Temple. He believed that he could definitely use this Essence Energy Art to advance to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>However, it was difficult to gather nine Life Providences and nine Life Souls. Typical Life Providences and Life Souls, such as the ten thousand Epic swordsmen, only existed as nutrients for the nine Life Providences and Life Souls. They didn’t truly become his Life Providences and Life Souls.</p>
<p>It was very rare for someone to become one of the nine main Life Providences and Life Souls. Up to now, Old Master Xia was still lacking one.</p>
<p>In fact, Xia Liuchuan was originally the ninth person that Old Master Xia had deliberately nurtured. However, for some reason, Old Master Xia ultimately didn’t absorb Xia Liuchuan.</p>
<p>It was only when Zhou Wen appeared that Old Master Xia planned on using Zhou Wen as his ninth Life Providence and Life Soul. At the same time, he would use the Life Providences and Life Souls of more than ten thousand people as nutrients to push himself to the Mythical stage and condense the Wheel of Destiny.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s performance left Old Master Xia alarmed. Zhou Wen was much stronger than the eight he had absorbed previously. It was a rare sight.</p>
<p>It was indeed as Old Master Xia had said. Zhou Wen’s body couldn’t withstand the power of the Sigh of the King. His flesh ruptured as bloody marks appeared on his skin. His muscles were torn apart as blood dripped. Cracks also appeared on his bones. If this continued, he would probably self-destruct.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was still as calm as before. He carefully sensed the forces that were pushing his body towards destruction.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen many powerful creatures—Torch Dragon, Tyrant Behemoth, Primordial Sword Immortal, Truth Listener, and the even stronger Guardians. They were all very powerful, forces that others looked up to.</p>
<p>However, no matter what kind of power it was, it couldn’t compare to the power in Zhou Wen’s body. Zhou Wen could sense that this power was a level higher than any power he had ever seen. It might even be on a higher level.</p>
<p>“If God opposes me, I will slay God… If an immortal opposes me, I will cull the immortal… No exchanges with god… No acquaintances with immortals… I am me…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen recalled the impudent and savage voice in his dream. It left him shuddering in fear, but it also made his blood boil.</p>
<h3 id='chapter755'>Chapter 755: The Might of One Saber Strike</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>His body ruptured as his flesh split open. Blood constantly flowed out, but Zhou Wen remained calm. He gripped the Bamboo Blade tightly with both hands as he focused his insights into it. He raised the Bamboo Blade high above his head.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia’s heart palpitated as though he sensed danger. His expression turned solemn as he stared intently at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The wounds on Zhou Wen’s body kept cracking, but his expression was as calm as before. He exerted strength with both hands and slashed down, aiming for Old Master Xia.</p>
<p>With this strike, the crazily erupting power in Zhou Wen’s body was instantly drained. It gathered on the blade, causing Bamboo Blade’s body to tremble.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia couldn’t see the trajectory of the saber when it landed. He was shocked and his body immediately phased away.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Old Master Xia’s body was split into two, turning into clear water that splattered on the ground.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Old Master Xia’s true body appeared. However, the Guardian armor on his body was shattering. From his helmet to his armor, a saber gash appeared.</p>
<p>An invisible saber force continued to press down on the armor, causing it to crack from top to bottom. Old Master Xia’s blood was also gushing out.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The Guardian armor on Old Master Xia’s body had shattered due to the blow. It turned into pieces of black jade that scattered to the ground, revealing Old Master Xia’s true body.</p>
<p>His body phased away again and appeared again shortly after. He must have used the Yin Yang Universe Ring’s ability.</p>
<p>However, when he appeared, the saber marks on his body were still spreading. It went from his head to his chest and then to his abdomen. The bloody mark constantly expanding as more and more blood oozed out.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia’s almost immortal Connate Dominance Body couldn’t stop the saber marks on his body from deepening, nor could it heal his wounds.</p>
<p>Old Master Xia watched as the saber marks on his body continued to tear, and his skull was about to split open. His expression turned somewhat crazy and in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Impossible… No power can take my life… My Connate Great Emperor Sutra is the strongest…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had converged the Sigh of the King’s power. His Slaughterer Life Soul had automatically turned still. During the slash, the Slaughterer Life Soul had automatically fused into Zhou Wen’s strike. Slaughterer, which had only been passively augmenting Zhou Wen, had actively shown its effects for the first time.</p>
<p>After shattering the Guardian armor, a strange force fused into the Slaughterer Life Soul, but it failed to advance as it did before.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t find it strange. The advancement of a Life Soul at higher levels was difficult to begin with. The last time he killed a Guardian, he had allowed Slaughterer to advance to an Evolved Body. It was obvious that killing one Guardian wasn’t enough to advance to a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>The strike had already drained Zhou Wen of all his combat strength.</p>
<p>In particular, his body had been severely damaged by the Sigh of the King. It was difficult for him to even stand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared at Slaughterer as the power of the strike continued to work wonders. It was about to rip Old Master Xia’s bones into two.</p>
<p>Without the Guardian’s power, no matter how strong Old Master Xia was, he was only at the Epic stage. Zhou Wen believed that it was impossible for him to withstand the terrifying saber force.</p>
<p>The saber force wasn’t only limited to the Sigh of the King; it also had Slaughterer’s strength embedded within. Zhou Wen felt that the strength of the strike wouldn’t vanish unless it killed its opponent.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>At this moment, a sudden bolt of lightning struck the top of Old Master Xia’s head.</p>
<p>The purple lightning bathed Old Master Xia’s body and actually shattered the saber force in Old Master Xia’s body. The strange purple lightning also fused into his body at the same time, as if a purple shadow was flashing across his body.</p>
<p>The moment the saber shattered, Old Master Xia’s injuries began to rapidly recover. What was even more terrifying was that his body was rapidly transforming. It looked like he was transforming from the Epic stage to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Are you f*cking kidding me? I carried you all the way here and suffered so much, but you actually helped that old sicko deal with me? Zhou Wen felt indignant.</p>
<p>He could clearly see that the purple lightning didn’t smite down from the void, but shot out from the log on the roof of the Hall of Supreme Harmony.</p>
<p>“Haha, I’m indeed a person blessed by the heavens. Even the heavens want to help me advance to the Mythical stage. It used divine lightning to condense another soul for me so that I can advance to the Mythical stage. Who in the world can stop me? I, Xia Jiuhuang, am the Emperor of Heaven. No one can stop me from becoming a god.” Old Master Xia threw his head back and laughed. The nine Life Souls on his body were faintly discernible as terrifying power spewed out from his body. His body was rapidly transforming.</p>
<p>As if responding to Old Master Xia, the thunder in the sky rumbled like a 21-gun salute.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sat weakly on the ground. He didn’t have the strength to continue fighting. If Old Master Xia really managed to advance, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have the strength to fight him.</p>
<p>However, the name Xia Jiuhuang finally made Zhou Wen know who Old Master Xia was. This name wasn’t only known to the Xia family, but it was also famous in the entire Federation. He was one of the six heroes who founded the Federation, the founder of the Xia family, the supposedly deceased legendary hero, Xia Jiuhuang.</p>
<p>At that moment, Xia Jiuhuang’s aura had reached its peak. His body had almost turned crystalline jade as his Essence Energy spewed out like a volcanic eruption. The nine Life Providences and the power of the nine Life Souls fused as one, and an ancient ‘Emperor’ word gradually surfaced on his forehead.</p>
<p>The ‘Emperor’ word shimmered with purple lightning as though it was a supreme existence.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could naturally guess that the purple word “Emperor” was likely the Wheel of Destiny condensed by Xia Jiuhuang. Once the Wheel of Destiny stabilized, he would have successfully advanced to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned Demonic Neonate and Truth Listener. At this point, all he could do was risk his life and strike Xia Jiuhuang down to the mortal world before he completed the transformation to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Just Demonic Neonate’s strength was clearly insufficient. Zhou Wen could only consider letting Truth Listener shatter more earrings. He needed to shatter at least three of them, but Zhou Wen couldn’t predict the outcome.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to order Truth Listener to shatter the earrings, he realized that something was amiss with Xia Jiuhuang’s condition. There was a faint power throbbing in his body, like a rhythmic heartbeat.</p>
<p>Although this power wasn’t powerful and seemed to be a part of Xia Jiuhuang’s body, it was sending Zhou Wen some kind of message.</p>
<p>Primordial Spore! Zhou Wen immediately knew what it was. It was the Primordial Spore that Zhou Wen had previously sent into Xia Jiuhang’s body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised. Typically, Primordial Spore would take a long time to parasitize a Mythical creature, but the information sent by Primordial Spore seemed to be telling Zhou Wen that it was already sprouting.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter756'>Chapter 756: Three-Sided Struggle</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately realized what the problem was. Previously, Xia Jiuhuang had a Guardian who had fused with him, taking his body to the Mythical stage. However, Zhou Wen had just killed the Guardian. Without a Guardian, Xia Jiuhuang—who hadn’t advanced to the Mythical stage—was only at the Epic stage, and he had nearly been killed by Zhou Wen’s saber strike. He was in a weakened state, so the Primordial Spore was able to succeed in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>Once the parasitism succeeded, it could quickly sprout before Xia Jiuhuang really advanced to the Mythical stage, unlike when it parasitized Mythical creatures.</p>
<p>From the information transmitted by the Primordial Spore, it wouldn’t take long to completely control Xia Jiuhang.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised. He originally believed that there was only one way to fight to the death, but he never expected that after reaching a dead end, a tiny Primordial Spore would turn the situation around.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>At the most critical moment of Xia Jiuhuang’s evolution, bolts of lightning struck down from the dark clouds and struck him continuously like a waterfall of lightning.</p>
<p>Not only did the lightning not injure Xia Jiuhuang, but he also used the power of lightning to help him evolve, allowing his body to become closer and closer to a Mythical physique.</p>
<p>According to what Zhou Wen knew, all Mythical creatures’ original stats were 11. As for humans, their original stats were estimated to be 1. It was even possible that they didn’t reach 1.</p>
<p>After all, human infants were too weak. They were far inferior to ordinary Legendary creatures, much less Mythical creatures.</p>
<p>Even ordinary Legendary creatures and Epic creatures seldom advanced to the Mythical stage; therefore, it was almost impossible for humans to advance to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Xia Jiuhuang had condensed nine supreme-grade Life Providences and Life Souls. He also needed a large amount of energy to advance to the Mythical stage. The ten thousand Epic humans from before were prepared by Xia Jiuhuang for this very purpose.</p>
<p>However, from the looks of it, it was still insufficient. With the help of the heavenly lightning, he was able to take the final step as his body rapidly transformed.</p>
<p>Unlike the combination of a Guardian, Xia Jiuhuang’s entire body emitted a mythical power. Every cell and strand of hair contained terrifying energy.</p>
<p>The present Xia Jiuhuang didn’t show any signs of an old man. His body was filled with the vitality of youth and terrifying explosive power. It was as though he could shatter mountains and rivers with a casual flick of his finger.</p>
<p>Xia Jiuhuang, who had long black hair dancing in the wind, was bathed in lightning. He looked like a resurrected ancient demon god.</p>
<p>On his forehead, the ‘Emperor’ word grew brighter and brighter like a purple star.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>With the final bolt of lightning striking him, Xia Jiuhuang completed the transformation from a human to a Mythical. It wasn’t a Mythical advancement with the help of a Guardian, but a true advancement with a human body. This was likely the first in human history.</p>
<p>“Finally… I’ve finally advanced to the Mythical stage…” Xia Jiuhuang floated in midair and raised his palm. He admired his transformed body as his excited voice trembled.</p>
<p>He had racked his brains and even faked his death to secretly scheme for so many years. Now, he had taken the final step.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t move because he could sense that the Primordial Spore was about to complete its soul parasitization. As long as the soul parasitization succeeded, it would be useless no matter how strong Xia Jiuhuang was.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you should feel honored to be the first person to die under the power of a human Mythical.” Xia Jiuhuang wanted to use Zhou Wen to test how powerful his Mythical powers were. The ‘Emperor’ character on his forehead lit up as he prepared to attack Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, Xia Jiuhuang suddenly screamed. He hugged his head and yelled. His voice was extremely shrill, as though someone had drilled into his brain with an electric drill.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was first taken aback before he saw the purple ‘Emperor’ character. He immediately understood what had happened.</p>
<p>That crappy piece of wood isn’t helping Xia Jiuhuang at all. Instead, it wants to enslave or even occupy Xia Jiuhuang’s Mythical body. Zhou Wen recalled the slave word on his forehead and connected it to the ‘Emperor’ character on Xia Jiuhuang’s forehead. Although the words were different, the form was surprisingly similar.</p>
<p>Looking at the screaming Xia Jiuhuang, Zhou Wen also received a message from the Primordial Spore. It was as though a force was vying for control of Xia Jiuhuang’s soul from Primordial Spore.</p>
<p>Xia Jiuhuang kept screaming. Now, his body could be considered a power struggle between powers—Xia Jiuhuang, Primordial Spore, and the “Emperor” on his forehead.</p>
<p>The three parties wanted to control Xia Jiuhuang’s body, but his will was the weakest. Even the Primordial Spore failed to gain an absolute advantage. The strongest was the ‘Emperor’ word.</p>
<p>“Why… Why is this happening… Jing Daoxian clearly said that as long as I can advance to the Mythical stage with a nine-life body… I will have the destiny of a Great Emperor… Why is this happening…” Xia Jiuhuang roared with a tragic cry. He wanted to slam his head into the ground, but his body didn’t listen to him. It left him alarmed and furious.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback when he heard Xia Jiuhuang’s roar. Jing Daoxian is actually involved in this matter?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that he had seen this scene somewhere before. After some thought, he recalled that Lord Alcohol had said something similar after eating the Longevity Fruit.</p>
<p>Looking at Xia Jiuhuang who was in excruciating pain, Zhou Wen suddenly felt a chill run down his spine. He had a bad feeling.</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol and Xia Jiuhuang were people who wanted to break through to the Mythical stage. Furthermore, they had listened to Jing Daoxian’s words to reach this stage.</p>
<p>As for the Lost Immortal Sutra that Zhou Wen cultivated, it was also from Jing Daoxian. Now that Zhou Wen wanted to advance to the Mythical stage, he felt that he was somewhat similar to Xia Jiuhang and company.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to think too much about it. The Primordial Spore wasn’t able to gain the upper hand. Its control over Xia Jiuhuang’s body was weakening, and Xia Jiuhuang’s will was about to vanish. Only the ‘Emperor’ word’s glow was getting stronger. It was only a matter of time before he gained control of Xia Jiuhuang’s body.</p>
<p>Before Xia Jiuhuang’s body was completely controlled, Zhou Wen drew his saber and slashed forward. At the same time, Truth Listener and Demonic Neonate attacked under Zhou Wen’s orders.</p>
<p>With the Primordial Spore restraining him, Xia Jiuhuang couldn’t move at all. Demonic Neonate didn’t need to find another opportunity as she unsheathed her demonic sword and stabbed forward.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s injuries were too serious, preventing him from using Sigh of the King. His strength was extremely limited, so when he slashed at Xia Jiuhuang’s body, not only did he fail to injure him, but he was sent flying by Xia Jiuhuang’s strength.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen fell to the ground as his wounds tore open. He grimaced in pain.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Truth Listener was more powerful. It shattered two earrings and brutally stabbed its claws into Xia Jiuhuang’s chest. The demonic sword stabbed into Xia Jiuhuang’s head, inch by inch.</p>
<p>The ‘Emperor’ word shimmered as it attempted to blast the demonic sword out, but Truth Listener violently struck Xia Jiuhuang’s forehead, causing the ‘Emperor’ word to tremble violently.</p>
<h3 id='chapter757'>Chapter 757: Scram</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Due to the restraint of the Primordial Spore, the ‘Emperor’ character was unable to stop Xia Jiuhuang’s body from counter attacking. The demonic sword stabbed into Xia Jiuhuang’s head inch by inch. At the same time, a black demonic aura invaded Xia Jiuhuang’s body, weakening his vitality.</p>
<p>The ‘Emperor’ word was a Wheel of Destiny condensed by Xia Jiuhuang. Its foundation was Xia Jiuhuang. As Xia Jiuhuang’s vitality weakened, the light on the ‘Emperor’ word dimmed, no longer having the same aura as before.</p>
<p>“How dare you…” Just as Zhou Wen was feeling delighted, he suddenly heard a cold woman’s voice coming from above the Hall of Supreme Harmony. The source of the voice was none other than the log erected there.</p>
<p>There’s a woman inside the log? Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>As the woman’s voice sounded from the log, the stars in the sky shimmered. Starlight cascaded down, passing through the dark clouds and illuminating Forbidden City.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a careful look and saw that the lit stars were clearly the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions. Apart from the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions, no other starlight penetrated the dark clouds.</p>
<p>The starlight shone down, causing Forbidden City to emit resplendent starlight. The four Corner Towers in particular emitted a divine glow.</p>
<p>Be it the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions in the sky or the four Corner Towers, they were all centered around the log. Starlight gathered on the log, causing the log to emit purple starlight as though there were countless stars swirling inside.</p>
<p>Under the illumination of the starlight emitted by the purple log, Zhou Wen felt a pain in his forehead. Immediately, he felt that something was amiss. He took out a mirror and saw purple light and lines appear on his forehead. From the parts that had condensed, it looked like he was about to condense the word “slave” again.</p>
<p>The layout of Forbidden City is the Purple Forbidden Enclosure. The Purple Star is also known as the Emperor Star. It’s the Life Star of an emperor. Now that the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions have appeared and the four Corner Towers have submitted, could it be that Emperor Polestar is in the log? Zhou Wen guessed.</p>
<p>If it was really the legendary Emperor Polestar, Zhou Wen felt that he was doomed today. Unlike ordinary Mythical creatures, Emperor Polestar was an existence that controlled all immortals. He was an immortal’s emperor and not something ordinary Mythical creatures could compare with.</p>
<p>The slave word on his forehead became more and more obvious. Zhou Wen switched several Life Souls, but he was unable to stop the formation of the slave word.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen felt a force surge out of his body. It was the power of the Sigh of the King. However, this time, it wasn’t under Zhou Wen’s control, but an autonomous act of the Sigh of the King. It was somewhat similar to the time he knelt.</p>
<p>In an instant, the incomplete ‘slave’ word on Zhou Wen’s forehead shattered and dissipated. The power of the Sigh of the King enveloped his body as though he had been placed in a warm embrace.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Scram!” Zhou Wen felt a voice coming from him.</p>
<p>The voice was indiscernible, but it seemed to possess a supreme might. The dark clouds that enveloped Forbidden City instantly dissipated, revealing the clear sky and sun. There was no longer any cloud.</p>
<p>The starlight of the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions instantly dimmed and vanished without a trace. The starlight of Forbidden City also dissipated as the four Corner Towers collapsed. The log fell from the Hall of Supreme Harmony and slammed into the ground.</p>
<p>The log trembled incessantly as though it was about to collapse. It left Zhou Wen alarmed.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Xia Jiuhuang’s body finally couldn’t withstand the power of the demonic sword and was split into two. Demonic aura surged through his corpse as though it wanted to destroy his body.</p>
<p>The mysterious phone suddenly vibrated. Zhou Wen took out his phone and saw that the game screen of the Dead Man Tree had automatically switched on. When he snapped a picture of Xia Jiuhuang’s corpse, it was sucked in without leaving a drop of blood behind.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Without having the time to take a careful look at the Dead Man Tree, Zhou Wen unsummoned his Companion Beasts and put on the Invisibility Cloak before running.</p>
<p>The log that had collapsed in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony trembled more and more violently, like a volcano that was about to erupt. As for Zhou Wen, the Sigh of the King’s power had already receded, making him feel uneasy. He wanted to escape from Forbidden City.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to the absence of the dark clouds and starlight, Zhou Wen successfully rushed out of Forbidden City. However, just as he rushed out, he saw a purple beam shoot into the sky.</p>
<p>Then, all of Forbidden City emitted a terrifying purple glow, like an immortal city condensed from starlight.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare look any further. He turned around and ran, hoping to get as far away from Forbidden City as possible.</p>
<p>After running for a short distance, he saw Wang Lu looking at Forbidden City with the chick and antelope not far away. The anomaly in Forbidden City worried Wang Lu. She closed her eyes and pressed her palms together in front of her chest as she muttered something.</p>
<p>“Goddess of Luck, please help Zhou Wen and let him return safely.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was greatly touched when he heard that. He thought to himself, Wang Lu is really kind-hearted.</p>
<p>The antelope’s eyes stared at Zhou Wen. Clearly, the Invisibility Cloak’s ability wasn’t effective against it.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>The chick was also staring in Zhou Wen’s direction, but its eyes were somewhat puzzled. It seemed to have discovered Zhou Wen, but it didn’t see him.</p>
<p>“Wang Lu, let’s go.” Zhou Wen appeared and ran out with Wang Lu.</p>
<p>Now that there was an anomaly in Forbidden City, no one knew what would happen. The further away they were, the better.</p>
<p>Wang Lu jumped in fright. Seeing that Zhou Wen was covered in injuries and many of his wounds were still bleeding, his clothes still drenched in blood, she couldn’t help but worry. “Are you alright?”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I won’t die yet. Let’s leave Forbidden City first. It’s too dangerous here.” Zhou Wen summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull and jumped up with Wang Lu before running away.</p>
<p>When he was far from Forbidden City, Zhou Wen made the Great Might Vajra Bull stop.</p>
<p>Only then did he feel the excruciating pain in his body. He had been in a highly-strung state and hadn’t paid any attention to his injuries. Now, he felt pain all over his body as though he was about to die. Every move he made hurt so much that he wanted to cry for mommy.</p>
<p>“Your injuries are serious. I’ll take you back to treat them now.” Wang Lu summoned a vine that crept onto Zhou Wen’s body and wrapped around him. At the same time, the bud burrowed into his wounds and emitted a faint glow to treat his injuries.</p>
<p>Then, she summoned a mount and brought Zhou Wen back like he was a vined mummy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s injuries were too serious. He didn’t know when he would recover, so he allowed Wang Lu to take him back.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was somewhat worried. He didn’t know how Xia Liuchuan and Xia Xuanyue were doing, but he was injured. He didn’t have the strength to save them.</p>
<p>With Xia Jiuhang dead, there shouldn’t be anyone in the Xia family who wants their lives, right? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that they wouldn’t be in any danger. He would get Wang Lu to help him gather information later.</p>
<p>The anomaly in Forbidden City made the Xia family and the Special Inspector Bureau very concerned. They had set up a large number of people to monitor the situation inside, but no one could enter. They had no idea what was happening. All they could see was that Forbidden City was enveloped by clouds like an immortal city, making it even more unfathomable.</p>
<h3 id='chapter758'>Chapter 758: Immortal Slaying</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen was wrapped in gauze like a mummy as he lay in bed. A winged pixie danced around Zhou Wen as it tried its best to spew out green light to nourish his injured body.</p>
<p>According to the information Wang Lu had obtained, although the changes in Forbidden City were intense, it was limited to the city’s interior. No dimensional creatures broke out.</p>
<p>What was different from before was that strange sounds could be heard coming from inside even though it wasn’t a stormy day. This used to happen inside Forbidden City during thunderstorms.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no one could enter Forbidden City, so no one knew what was happening inside.</p>
<p>Due to Old Master Xia’s disappearance, the Xia family was in a mess. Nothing had happened to Xia Liuchuan and Xia Xuanyue. They had even appeared near Forbidden City in the past two days.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had roughly guessed the outcome. Apart from Xia Jiuhang, few people in the Xia family wanted them dead. After all, they were the Xia family’s hope.</p>
<p>The death of more than ten thousand Epic experts was a huge blow to any of the six hero families. It would definitely affect the Xia family greatly.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t as serious as Zhou Wen imagined. The ten thousand Epic experts were mostly nurtured by Xia Jiuhuang himself to be sacrificed for his advancement to the Mythical stage. Therefore, these people were from the East Courtyard and didn’t affect the Xia family’s normal system.</p>
<p>From this, it could be seen that Xia Jiuhuang still had some feelings for the Xia family. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have separated these people from the Xia family and set up a separate East Courtyard.</p>
<p>There was also Xia Liuchuan and Xia Xuanyue. Their talent, Life Providences, and Life Souls were top-notch. Xia Jiuhuang could have used one of them as his ninth Life Soul, but he didn’t do so in the end. Perhaps there were some emotional factors involved.</p>
<p>No matter what, the destruction of Xia Jiuhuang and the East Courtyard had dealt quite a blow to the Xia family, greatly reducing their influence in the Federation.</p>
<p>The Xia family and the bureau were searching for Old Master Xia and Zhou Wen’s whereabouts, but no one saw Zhou Wen come out of Forbidden City. They imagined that Zhou Wen was trapped in the mutated Forbidden City like Old Master Xia, so they didn’t search the Imperial Capital.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been recuperating in Grandma Wang’s yard for the past two days. It was odd. In such a huge yard, other than Grandma Wang, there were only a few old ladies and a butler. He didn’t see any younger members of the Wang family.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen asked Wang Lu and learned that this was where Grandma Wang recuperated. The other members of the Wang family didn’t live here, and the Wang family’s real residence wasn’t nearby.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held his phone with his stiff wrapped hand and saw a purple flower sprout grow on the Dead Man Tree. It was likely the flower that had absorbed Xia Jiuhuang.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat looking forward to seeing what fruit the flower would bear.</p>
<p>Xia Jiuhuang had advanced to the Mythical stage with nine supreme-grade Life Providences and Life Souls. Furthermore, he had the power of the log condensed in his body, so the fruit produced from him definitely wouldn’t be too bad.</p>
<p>It’s a shame about my Six-Winged. Zhou Wen sighed softly. Six-Winged had been with him for so long, so he wasn’t used to suddenly losing it.</p>
<p>Lying in bed with nothing to do, Zhou Wen used his phone to grind dungeons. He originally imagined that he could happily farm the nine black dragons, but to his surprise, they hadn’t respawned.</p>
<p>The other Mythical creatures respawn every day. Don’t tell me these nine black dragons respawn after nine days? Zhou Wen guessed.</p>
<p>Since he couldn’t farm the black dragons, Zhou Wen placed his sights on the Guardian again. During his battle with Xia Jiuhuang, Zhou Wen had gained some insight into the concept of power from the Sigh of the King. He had also found a way to use Slaughterer Life Soul. The might of that move was immense, so it might pose a threat to the Guardian.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen called that move Immortal Slaying. It was basically a single-use attack. If he couldn’t kill the enemy with one move, Zhou Wen would be crippled.</p>
<p>The main reason was that Immortal Slaying was based on the Sigh of the King and the Slaughterer Life Soul.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that the Slaughterer Life Soul couldn’t be powered, but the amount of power needed to drive it was too great. Without the massive power of the Sigh of the King as a foundation, it was impossible to power the Slaughterer Life Soul.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, using the Sigh of the King would place a huge burden on Zhou Wen’s body. Furthermore, Immortal Slaying would drain him of all his strength instantaneously, so Zhou Wen basically didn’t have any combat strength after a single strike.</p>
<p>The might of this strike was something that even Xia Jiuhuang, who was wearing Guardian armor, couldn’t withstand. He had even killed the black jade guardian with one strike. Such strength might be of some use against the Guardian in Ant City and the war wagon.</p>
<p>It was too dangerous to use Immortal Slaying in real life. Perhaps he would die before injuring the enemy.</p>
<p>However, in-game, he didn’t have so many qualms. He just had to do it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s two arms were held in place by a splint. He could only lie on the bed as he raised his arms straight like a zombie. He held his phone and began gaming.</p>
<p>Before the nine black dragons respawned, the war wagon remained at the bottom of the sea. Zhou Wen went straight to the underground sea, hoping to see if Immortal Slaying could kill the Guardian inside.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen arrived at the underground sea, he heard a sound from the window.</p>
<p>The windows here weren’t glass windows, but windows that were made of ancient wood paper. They were opened by rolling them up and propped up with a wooden stick.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned his head to look at the window and saw two ponytails sticking out. Then, he saw a little girl’s head slowly extend out. She was sprawled on the window sill, staring at Zhou Wen with her big, limpid eyes as she looked curiously at him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that the girl was only about eleven or twelve years old. She was very cute and looked a little like Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“Hey little one, what’s your name?” Zhou Wen asked her.</p>
<p>“Wang Chan,” the little girl answered.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to ask another question, his hand suddenly slipped and the phone smashed down on his face. Zhou Wen’s eyes bruised as his nose ached.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to pick up the phone, but he couldn’t bend his arm.</p>
<p>“Let me help you.” Wang Chan pushed open the door and ran in. She reached out to pick up the phone on Zhou Wen’s face and handed it to him.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Little Chan…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out to take the phone when he suddenly heard someone shouting outside the yard. “Miss Little Chan, where are you? Come out quickly!”</p>
<p>Little Chan jumped in fright as she looked back at the door and handed the phone to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s arm was too stiff. Before he could grab the phone, it fell with a thud and smashed into Zhou Wen’s face. He grimaced in pain.</p>
<h3 id='chapter759'>Chapter 759: Wang Chan</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen was about to cry when Wang Chan gestured for him to keep quiet before quickly hiding under the bed.</p>
<p>Soon, an old woman walked in and looked into the room. She didn’t see Wang Chan, so she said to Zhou Wen that she was sorry for disturbing him before closing the door.</p>
<p>Only then did Wang Chan crawl out from under the bed and swat away the dust on her body. She then picked up the phone beside the pillow and handed it to Zhou Wen. “Sorry, who are you? Why are you lying here?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took the phone and said, “My name is Zhou Wen. I’m Wang Lu’s classmate.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re that Numbskull Wen? I heard my sister mention you before,” Wang Chan said in enlightenment.</p>
<p>“What Numbskull Wen?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback, but he knew that Wang Chan was Wang Lu’s younger sister. He just didn’t know if she was his biological sister or his cousin.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Wang Chan didn’t answer. She only sized him up curiously and said, “Why are you so heavily injured? Why don’t I help you heal?”</p>
<p>“Actually, it’s just a superficial wound. With the life pixie’s treatment, I’ll be fine in a few days,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Wang Chan curled her lips and said, “Life pixie’s healing effects are too poor. I have better Companion Beasts here that can quickly heal your injuries. Since you are my sister’s friend, you are also my friend. It’s only right that I help you. You don’t have to stand on ceremony.”</p>
<p>With that said, Wang Chan summoned a Companion Beast. It looked very strange. No matter how Zhou Wen looked at it, it looked like a syringe with wings.</p>
<p>Although the syringe had cute little wings and was pink in color, similar to Cupid’s Arrow of Love, it was a syringe. Zhou Wen, who had been seriously ill when he was young, often had injections. He just couldn’t bring himself to love something like a syringe.</p>
<p>“This… There’s no need…” Zhou Wen couldn’t bear to reject Wang Chan’s kindness, but he didn’t wish to be injected.</p>
<p>“Don’t stand on ceremony with me. You will recover quickly,” Wang Chan said as she ordered the syringe to fly down and stab Zhou Wen in the arm.</p>
<p>The liquid in the syringe was injected.</p>
<p>This syringe Companion Beast looked rather intelligent. It was actually able to accurately inject intravenously.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt heat enter his blood vessels. It was warm and didn’t hurt much. Furthermore, when the medicinal essence spread within his blood, Zhou Wen immediately felt energized and even felt his blood boil.</p>
<p>“Little Chan… Where are you… We are going back…” At that moment, a woman’s voice sounded from outside the wall. When Little Chan heard the voice, her expression changed slightly. She turned her head and said to Zhou Wen, “My mom is looking for me. I’ll come and see you tomorrow. Goodbye, Numbskull Wen.”</p>
<p>With that said, Wang Chan ran out without waiting for Zhou Wen’s reply.</p>
<p>She already has a Companion Beast at such a young age. Wang Lu’s sister’s talent isn’t bad. She’s quite kind. Zhou Wen felt his vitality surge as his injuries seemed to heal much faster.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to continue gaming, he felt something amiss. He felt his body heat up as though there was a furnace in his body.</p>
<p>It’s so hot… It’s so hot… Not long after, Zhou Wen felt like he was about to die. He tore open the gauze on his body, allowing the heat in his body to emit.</p>
<p>Even so, he still felt uncomfortable. It was as though there was a force pushing him, making him involuntarily move.</p>
<p>He first ran, but he realized that running vented too little heat. Zhou Wen sprawled on the ground to do push-ups. It was as though he had installed an electric motor as his body rapidly rose and fell while he emitted hot air.</p>
<p>The heat was really helpful to Zhou Wen’s injuries, accelerating the healing of his wounds. However, Zhou Wen’s crazy exercise ruptured his wounds again.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen finally stopped, he realized that not only had his injuries not healed, but some areas that had already healed had ruptured.</p>
<p>What Companion Beast is that? Why are its effects so domineering? Zhou Wen was somewhat helpless.</p>
<p>Although Wang Chan’s Companion Beast had a healing effect and the effects were very good, he couldn’t withstand the heat and had crazily exercised, resulting in the opposite effect.</p>
<p>After lying in bed again, Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered to get someone to wrap him in gauze. He got the life pixie to treat his injuries as he lay in bed gaming.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar entered the underground sea and opened the door to the war wagon. He saw the white cocoon floating in the void.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the Golden Overlord Sword and activated the Sigh of the King. He waited for the Sigh of the King to reach a certain intensity before activating Slaughterer and striking with Immortal Slaying.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar’s body trembled because the Sigh of the King’s strength was just too powerful. It caused the blood-colored avatar’s body to crack as blood seeped out.</p>
<p>This level of strength was still insufficient to activate Slaughterer. When the blood-colored avatar’s body was about to collapse, Slaughterer was finally activated. Zhou Wen held the Golden Overlord Sword and activated Immortal Slaying as he slashed at the white cocoon.</p>
<p>The void was cleaved apart as spatial powers were unable to withstand the power of Immortal Slaying. The white cocoon was split open almost instantly, revealing the Guardian inside.</p>
<p>This was the first time Zhou Wen had seen the Guardian’s full appearance. It was somewhat different from what he had imagined. The Guardian inside the cocoon wasn’t a dragon. It looked more like an ancient emperor.</p>
<p>Dressed in an imperial robe with a crown on his head, a hand extended out. It had six fingers, and each finger wore a ring.</p>
<p>Immediately, the six rings emitted intense spatial fluctuations as one hand reached towards the Golden Overlord Sword.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Wherever the Golden Overlord Sword passed, the Guardian’s arm was severed. Blood splattered as the spatial power failed to change the trajectory of Immortal Slaying.</p>
<p>At first, Zhou Wen was delighted when he saw the Guardian extend its other hand. It also had six fingers and wore six rings. With a smack of its hand, it destroyed the blood-colored avatar that had entered a weakened state after using Immortal Slaying. The game screen went black.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Immortal Slaying is still useful against Guardians. However, next time, I should directly sever the Guardian’s neck. Zhou Wen dripped his blood to revive and entered the game again.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen realized that although the Immortal Slaying strike could tie with the Guardian, he lacked the ability to fight after a miss since it drained him of all his combat strength. As for the Guardian, it had very powerful spatial powers. It was clearly very difficult to kill him with one strike. Zhou Wen tried a few times, but he could only injure him, not kill him.</p>
<p>The power of Immortal Slaying deals damage over time. If I can guarantee that the blood-colored avatar won’t be killed by the counter attack, the Guardian might die if I wait a little longer. Zhou Wen continued his attempts.</p>
<p>He realized that this was similarly difficult to do. This was because, after the Immortal Slaying strike, the blood-colored avatar’s body would be almost at its limits. It had no combat ability at all. It was impossible for it to escape in front of a Guardian who was proficient in spatial powers.</p>
<p>My level is still too low. If I were also at the Mythical stage, killing this Guardian with one strike wouldn’t be a problem. Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss.</p>
<h3 id='chapter760'>Chapter 760: An Essence Energy Art Story</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>After many attempts, Zhou Wen realized that a better choice was to find a weaker Guardian to kill. For example, the black-jade Guardian he had killed or the previous six-winged seraphim.</p>
<p>I wonder where that six-winged seraphim went. It’ll be good if I can find him, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>The Guardians in Ant City and the war wagon were probably the strongest among the Guardians. At the very least, none of the Guardians that Zhou Wen had seen had displayed strength stronger than theirs.</p>
<p>The next morning, Wang Chan surprisingly came again.</p>
<p>The wounds on Zhou Wen’s body had already been rebandaged. Wang Lu had rebandaged him yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t mention Wang Chan. After all, Wang Chan was just being nice. There was no need for him to mention the matter and make the sisters unhappy.</p>
<p>When Wang Chan saw Zhou Wen’s state, she asked in surprise, “Are your injuries not healed yet? Didn’t I already treat you yesterday?”</p>
<p>“It’s almost healed. I wish to recuperate further,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Why don’t I give you another injection?” As Wang Chan spoke, she summoned the syringe-like Companion Beast again.</p>
<p>“There’s no need, no need at all.” Zhou Wen hurriedly waved his hand. “Don’t treat my injuries. I just want to be lazy and lie here for a few days. If you treat all my injuries, I’ll have to continue working.”</p>
<p>“So you are just trying to skive.” Wang Chan was enlightened. She didn’t insist on treating Zhou Wen’s injuries and unsummoned the syringe Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“I heard from Sis that you are a genius. You can become very powerful just by casually learning a skill. Is that true?” Wang Chan asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Your sister is exaggerating. I also have to spend serious efforts practicing,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I knew it. How can there be anyone so awesome in this world who can learn something so casually? I’ve already tried so hard, but I still can’t figure things out.” Wang Chan seemed to heave a sigh of relief as she pulled a chair and placed it in front of the bed. She leaned against the back of the chair and looked at Zhou Wen. “Do you have some secret trick to learning? Can you teach me?”</p>
<p>“It’s not a secret trick, but I still have some experience to share. What do you want to learn?” Zhou Wen thought that since Wang Lu had helped him so much, it was only right for him to help her sister.</p>
<p>“Essence Energy Arts, sword techniques, movement techniques, and so on are all difficult to learn. No matter how hard I try, I can’t meet their standards. I keep getting scolded,” Wang Chan said with a bitter expression.</p>
<p>“Why do you find it difficult?” Zhou Wen asked Wang Chan.</p>
<p>“Because it’s very difficult to remember. My memory isn’t too good. I keep memorizing the front and forgetting the back. After memorizing the back, I forget the front,” Wang Chan said.</p>
<p>“Actually, it’s very simple. Just tell me any Essence Energy Skill you have learned. I’ll tell you how to memorize it in an easier manner,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“This is an Essence Energy Art that I’ve been memorizing recently. I’ll recite it to you.” Wang Chan began reciting.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen listened for a while before his expression gradually turned awkward. The Essence Energy Arts that Wang Chan recited were all unfamiliar and obscure ancient texts. Furthermore, they were very long. She had recited a few thousand words in one go, but it sounded like there was still a long way to go.</p>
<p>Even with Zhou Wen’s memory, it was difficult for him to memorize everything without understanding the meaning of the article.</p>
<p>“Eh… Little Chan, stop for a moment. How many words do you have left for this Essence Energy Art?” Zhou Wen stopped Wang Chan and asked.</p>
<p>“There are a total of 134,467 words. I’ve memorized them for days, but I still forget the back after memorizing the front. I keep making mistakes,” Wang Chan said in distress.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, It would be a miracle if you could memorize all of them. If you can’t figure out the meaning of such an obscure ancient text, just relying on your memory to memorize the words correctly, you wouldn’t be a genius, but a god.</p>
<p>This ancient text was actually about the same as a foreign language. Thinking about it, it would be too harsh to require someone to memorize a work of more than a hundred thousand foreign words in a few days and not make a single mistake.</p>
<p>“Has anyone explained the content of this Essence Energy Art to you?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, but it sounds very difficult to understand and I don’t really remember it,” Wang Chan said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said to Wang Chan with a smile, “Then do you like stories?”</p>
<p>“I like them. I love hearing my sister tell me stories about the Federation’s six heroes. They fight and explore in unknown dimensional zones. I also hope that I can be like them one day—going to unknown places to fight unknown powerful creatures and obtain magical Companion Beasts…” Wang Chan wore a look of anticipation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen said to Wang Chan with a smile, “Actually, the Essence Energy Art you recited was a story of a hero’s adventure.”</p>
<p>“Tch, can you not try to coax me like I’m a little girl?” Wang Chan curled her lips and said.</p>
<p>“If you don’t believe me, recite it and I’ll translate this heroic adventure story for you,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Wang Chan naturally didn’t believe him as she began reciting the Essence Energy Art. “The Great Dao has no form, yet it creates the Heaven and Earth. The Great Dao is lawless, but it rules the Sun and Moon. The great Dao is nameless, but it nourishes all things…”</p>
<p>As Wang Chan recited, she looked at Zhou Wen. No matter how she thought about it, she couldn’t tell what relationship the Essence Energy Art had with a hero story.</p>
<p>“Alright, let me translate this sentence for you.” Zhou Wen gestured for Wang Chan to stop reciting.</p>
<p>Wang Chan stopped reciting and blinked at Zhou Wen, not believing that it could be translated into a story.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pondered for a moment before saying, “There’s a beautiful and adorable girl. She’s extremely talented. She became a Legendary at the age of three, an Epic at the age of six, and she advanced to the Mythical stage at the age of nine. At the age of twelve, she’s already invincible in the Federation…”</p>
<p>“How can there be such a powerful girl? Are you spouting nonsense? Furthermore, this has nothing to do with Essence Energy Arts, right?” Wang Chan curled her lips and said.</p>
<p>“Listen to what I have to say. That young heroine was invincible when she was twelve years old. She was just too lonely and wanted to suffer defeat. But on this day, a youth about her age appeared and challenged her. In the end, he defeated her with one strike.”</p>
<p>Wang Chan interrupted again. “Why is your story contradictory? You previously said that the girl was invincible. How could she be defeated in one strike?”</p>
<p>“Do you still want to hear the story?” Zhou Wen glared at her.</p>
<p>“Continue.” Wang Chan smiled.</p>
<p>“After being defeated by the youth, the girl asked the youth, ‘Why are you so powerful?’ The youth answered her, ‘Because I obtained a treasure in a mysterious dimensional zone. That treasure can nurture the Heaven and Earth and control the movement of the Sun and Moon… From then on, the girl embarked on her journey to find the treasure…”</p>
<p>As Wang Chan recited, Zhou Wen translated the content she recited into a hero story. Wang Chan was gradually attracted by the content of the story and forgot to pick up on Zhou Wen’s plot holes.</p>
<h3 id='chapter761'>Chapter 761: Invisibly Downloaded A Dungeon</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>In any piece of knowledge, the most difficult to remember were the unfamiliar professional terms and descriptions. As such words and descriptions were not usually used, there were not many ways to connect these terms to one’s knowledge system.</p>
<p>Just like a person from the West District, he didn’t know what the Dao was even if you let him read the scriptures. He also didn’t know what the Eight Trigrams was if you let him read the Iching. These words were very difficult for foreigners to form memories.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen told the story, he turned these esoteric words into treasures in the story. It made Wang Chan find these treasures novel and interesting, allowing her to remember them.</p>
<p>“The story you made up is rather interesting, but the treasures in the story are different from the true meaning of the Essence Energy Art, right?” After Wang Chan finished hearing Zhou Wen’s story, she felt somewhat unsatisfied that it was over, but she also realized a problem.</p>
<p>“Although it’s different, it made you remember those words that were originally difficult to remember, right?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>Wang Chan thought about it and realized that she had memorized it. When she thought of those words, she found them a lot more vivid.</p>
<p>“In the future, when you learn those obscure Essence Energy Arts and Essence Energy Skills, treat them as a story. Treat the things you don’t understand as battles with various unknown dimensional creatures. After defeating them, the knowledge you obtain will be treasures,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I’m not as delusional as you,” Wang Chan said.</p>
<p>“If you don’t even dare think about it and only learn to walk the path of others, what’s the point of such a life?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Wang Chan looked at Zhou Wen in a daze. All the experts in her family that taught her would tell her how powerful so-and-so Essence Energy Arts and Essence Energy Skills were, as well as their origins. They would talk about what it would be like if she mastered them.</p>
<p>No one had ever told her that no matter how powerful the Essence Energy Arts and Essence Energy Skills were, they were left behind by others. No matter how strong she became from cultivating them, she was ultimately inferior to others.</p>
<p>“Is it really okay to fantasize like this?” Wang Chan looked at Zhou Wen in a daze as though she was asking him, but also muttering to herself.</p>
<p>“Of course. There’s nothing in this world that you can’t think of or do. As long as you dare think of it, you will eventually think of a solution. The most important thing is that you dare think of it,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I’ll give it a try in the future.” Wang Chan was about to say something when she heard her phone ring. It wasn’t someone calling her, but an alarm she had set.</p>
<p>“I need to return, but I’ll remember your story. I’ll also remember your words.” Wang Chan thought for a moment and said, “You are indeed as my sister said. You are a very special person.”</p>
<p>After Wang Chan left, Zhou Wen finally got some peace and began grinding.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen lay on the bed, he suddenly heard a crack. The wooden bed then collapsed.</p>
<p>This was an ancient carved wood bed with a flower-engraved rack on it. The entire bed fell apart and immediately, Zhou Wen fell to the ground as the shattered wood hit him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s injuries hadn’t healed. The wood couldn’t injure him, but when it hit him, the corners of his mouth twitched in pain.</p>
<p>What’s going on? My luck hasn’t been good recently. I can even break a bed? Zhou Wen was depressed.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the sound, the butler came over and was alarmed when he saw Zhou Wen. He hurriedly helped him up and got someone to tidy up the bed before changing it to a new bed.</p>
<p>In the next few days when Zhou Wen was recuperating, Wang Chan often secretly came to play with him.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, Zhou Wen was very unlucky every time Wang Chan came.</p>
<p>One time, Wang Chan ran over while Zhou Wen was eating. Just as Zhou Wen was about to finish the bowl of rice, he realized that there was half a worm in it. It nearly made him vomit all the rice he had eaten.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suspected that his bad luck had something to do with Wang Chan. This was because Wang Chan would be beside him every time he was unlucky.</p>
<p>However, he thought for a moment and found it unlikely.</p>
<p>Wang Lu was Wang Chan’s sister. It was impossible for the people around her to be unlucky when she was such a lucky person.</p>
<p>However, there was something strange. Wang Chan always came to him when there was no one around. It was as if she didn’t want anyone to see her.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only believed that the Wang family was strict and that they placed a lot of emphasis on her studies, so they didn’t give Wang Chan time to play. This resulted in her sneaking out, so he didn’t tell Wang Lu and Grandma Wang about this.</p>
<p>After a few days, Zhou Wen’s injuries healed significantly. Although he couldn’t engage in an intense battle, ordinary movements were no longer a problem. He left the Wang family and had a stroll.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t plan on returning to Luoyang. He had yet to settle the most important matter of his trip to the Imperial Capital.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen put on the Invisibility Cloak and walked on the streets without anyone seeing him. He headed for the Ancient Sword Tomb.</p>
<p>The Ancient Sword Tomb was one of the Xia family’s important dimensional zones. Many sword-type Companion Beasts were obtained from the Ancient Sword Tomb. Therefore, Zhou Wen planned on heading to the Ancient Sword Tomb to take a look. If there was a tiny palm symbol, he could download an Ancient Sword Tomb dungeon.</p>
<p>Apart from the Ancient Sword Tomb, there were many dimensional zones in the Imperial Capital. Zhou Wen planned on making a trip to all of them.</p>
<p>The Ancient Sword Tomb was guarded by the Xia family’s guards, but they were useless against Zhou Wen. With the Invisibility Cloak, the guards couldn’t see him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used the power of the Godfiend Era and floated over without making a sound.</p>
<p>After searching outside the Ancient Sword Tomb for a while, he easily found a tiny palm symbol and snapped it.</p>
<p>My luck today is pretty good. Zhou Wen turned around and left the Ancient Sword Tomb in delight as he headed for the next dimensional zone.</p>
<p>On the way to his next destination, Ancient Sword Tomb finished downloading. However, it was inconvenient to use the phone while wearing the Invisibility Cloak. If he were to leave the phone unexposed, passersby would see a phone flying in the air. Timid ones would probably wet their pants in fright.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s second dimensional zone was the Thirteen Mausoleum.</p>
<p>It was an ancient royal cemetery. After the dimensional storms, it had also become a dimensional zone. It was rather magical inside with many good things available.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Thirteen Mausoleum was a dimensional zone under the bureau. It forbade outsiders from entering. Zhou Wen had had a bad impression of the bureau. If it wasn’t for his serious injuries, he would definitely have made a trip to the bureau’s headquarters.</p>
<p>Now that he had yet to recover from his injuries, he couldn’t go to the bureau’s headquarters for the time being. However, it wasn’t a bad idea to take a picture of their dimensional zones.</p>
<p>His luck today was unexpectedly good. After Zhou Wen arrived at the Thirteen Mausoleum, he found the tiny palm symbol and successfully downloaded another game dungeon.</p>
<p>After leaving the Thirteen Mausoleum, Zhou Wen continued heading to the next dimensional zone. This time, the dimensional zone Zhou Wen went to was rather famous. It was the legendary Great Wall.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter762'>Chapter 762: Goddess of Misfortune Life Providence</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>There were Great Wall dimensional zones in many places, not just in the Imperial Capital.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have the chance to go anywhere else for the time being. He decided to head to the local one first, hoping to find the tiny palm symbol to download it as a game dungeon.</p>
<p>The various Great Wall dimensional zones were mostly the same. The dimensional creatures in them were creatures called Battle Souls. However, the Battle Souls differed by district.</p>
<p>The most common Battle Soul here was called the Undying Battle Soul. It was said that no matter what method was used, one could not kill the Battle Souls here. Therefore, as time passed, no one visited.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was most interested in these strange dimensional creatures, so he wanted to download the dungeon into his phone and study them.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen arrived in front of the Great Wall and before he could begin searching for the tiny palm symbol, he saw two people walk over. One of them was Wang Chan.</p>
<p>“Little Chan, where are you going?” A silver-haired youth walked beside Wang Chan as he asked.</p>
<p>“It’s my freedom to go wherever I want. It’s none of your business,” Wang Chan said without turning her head.</p>
<p>“How are you not my business? Your father wants me to take care of you. I can’t let anything happen to you. If anything happens to you, how am I to answer your father?” the silver-haired youth said with a smile.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to explain it to him. Xiao Si, I can tell you now that I definitely won’t go to the South District with you. I want to be like my sister and enter Sunset College to study,” Wang Chan said.</p>
<p>Xiao Si’s expression remained unchanged as he continued following Wang Chan. He said casually, “Little Chan, don’t joke around. Your sister has the Life Providence of the Goddess of Luck, so she can naturally go wherever she wants. However, your Life Providence is the Goddess of Misfortune. Apart from me, who has the Traversing Misfortune Buddha Body, who else can turn your misfortune into a blessing? Only with me by your side can you reverse fate and enjoy fortune. The heavens have destined me to protect you for the rest of your life.”</p>
<p>“I don’t need any luck, much less your protection. Don’t think I don’t know that you want to use this to threaten my family to help your family,” Wang Chan said.</p>
<p>“I need your family’s help, but you also need my help. Isn’t that good?” Xiao Si said.</p>
<p>“No, not at all. I’ve said it before. I don’t need your help, nor do I need any luck,” Wang Chan said.</p>
<p>“You can shrug it off, but have you considered your family? If I do not resolve your bad luck, your family will be affected by it. Don’t tell me you don’t know that? Your Wang family originally had a great opportunity to advance the Wang family further and even become an existence comparable to the Xia family. However, it was because of your birth that the Wang family failed. If not for your sister’s strong luck, the Wang family might have rapidly declined. Would you wish for that to happen again?” Xiao Si said slowly.</p>
<p>Wang Chan curled her lips and said, “Don’t try to scare me. With my sister around, my bad luck won’t affect my family. Furthermore, I’ll be studying at Sunset College soon, so it won’t affect my family.”</p>
<p>“Then what about the people from Sunset College? You will have classmates, friends, and people you like there, but the better your relationship with them and the closer you are to them, the more they will be affected by your bad luck. They will constantly be unlucky and they might even lose their lives because of you. Have you really decided to study at Sunset College without my company?” Xiao Si said calmly.</p>
<p>When Wang Chan heard Xiao Si’s words, she seemed to hesitate. However, she still said, “Don’t try to scare me. My Life Providence isn’t that terrifying. Even if you and my sister aren’t around, my Life Providence won’t kill anyone. It will only bring a little misfortune.”</p>
<p>The invisible Zhou Wen listened for a long time before he finally understood two things. Wang Lu’s luck wasn’t some form of metaphysics, but because she had the Goddess of Luck Life Providence. Zhou Wen had long guessed that.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s surprise, Wang Lu’s sister, Wang Chan ended up having a completely opposite Goddess of Misfortune Life Providence. It was unbelievable that sisters born from the same parents would have such different Life Providences.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>However, on second thought, the bad luck he encountered every time he met Wang Chan convinced him of her having such a Life Providence.</p>
<p>The smile on Xiao Si’s face vanished as he looked at Wang Chan and said, “The reason why you want to study at Sunset College isn’t because of your sister, am I right?”</p>
<p>“What has this got to do with you? Anyway, I definitely won’t return to the Xiao family in the South District with you,” Wang Chan said.</p>
<p>Xiao Si laughed. “It’s fine. You can try to find that person and see what kind of effect your Life Providence will have on him. Then, it won’t be too late to make a decision. I believe that other than me, no man in the world can withstand the bad luck you bring.”</p>
<p>“I’ve already tried. There’s no problem,” Wang Chan said.</p>
<p>“Then did you take him to a dimensional zone?” Xiao Si asked.</p>
<p>“Why must I go to a dimensional zone?” Wang Chan asked.</p>
<p>“If you really go to Sunset College to study, it’s inevitable that you will enter a dimensional zone to complete your homework missions. Isn’t that normal? Or are you afraid that he will lose his life because of you?” Xiao Si said with a smile.</p>
<p>“So be it. It’s no big deal.” Wang Chan turned around in a huff and left.</p>
<p>Xiao Si stood there without moving. After watching Wang Chan leave, he took out his phone and made a call. “An outsider approached Wang Chan and gained her trust. That person might be a student at Sunset College. Find out who that person is. I don’t wish for him to affect our plans of having Wang Chan enter our Xiao family.”</p>
<p>After hanging up, Xiao Si slowly left.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched Xiao Si leave and pondered for a moment before taking out his phone to call Wang Lu and ask her about Wang Chan and Xiao Si.</p>
<p>When Wang Lu heard that Zhou Wen had already met Wang Chan, she sighed and recounted the details regarding Wang Chan and Xiao Si.</p>
<p>When Wang Chan was young, her luck was a little bad, but she was still very talented and hardworking. The family had placed high hopes on her.</p>
<p>However, a few months ago, Wang Chan condensed her Life Providence. Unexpectedly, her Life Providence was Goddess of Misfortune. It was the opposite of Wang Lu’s Life Providence.</p>
<p>Her Life Providence brought quite a bit of trouble to the people around her. Only when Wang Lu was by her side would the situation improve.</p>
<p>However, it was impossible for Wang Lu to stay by her side forever. Therefore, the Wang family had always hoped to resolve the problem of Wang Chan’s Life Providence. They came up with many solutions, but none of them worked well.</p>
<p>The Xiao family in the South District had somehow heard of this matter. It made Xiao Si, who had a Traversing Misfortune Buddha Body, go to the Wang family. Under the influence of his Traversing Misfortune Buddha Body, not only did Wang Chan’s Life Providence not trigger any more misfortune, but she also became lucky.</p>
<p>This made Wang Chan’s parents, Wang Lu, and everyone else very happy. The Xiao family didn’t make any excessive requests. They only hoped that Xiao Si could stay in the Wang family and spend more time with Wang Chan. If the two of them could get along well, they might be able to become husband and wife when Wang Chan reached the legal age of marriage.</p>
<p>Their Life Providences complemented each other. If they could really become husband and wife, it would be beneficial to both of them.</p>
<p>Although the Wang family felt that the Xiao family was deliberately trying to curry favor with them and definitely needed their help, Xiao Si’s Life Providence was too important to Wang Chan. It was worth it even if the Wang family had to pay a price.</p>
<p>Therefore, they allowed Xiao Si to stay in the Wang family to accompany Wang Chan. Firstly, it could resolve the danger of the Goddess of Misfortune Life Providence, and secondly, they could let them spend some time together and see if anything blossomed.</p>
<p>Perhaps what the Xiao family wants isn’t the Wang family’s help, but Wang Chan herself, Zhou Wen thought. However, as he didn’t have any evidence, it wasn’t his place to tell Wang Lu his thoughts.</p>
<h3 id='chapter763'>Chapter 763: Pulling Out Swords in Ancient Sword Tomb</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen searched the Great Wall for a long time but failed to find the tiny palm symbol. He wasted the afternoon just like that.</p>
<p>The sky had already darkened by the time he returned to the courtyard.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen opened the door, he realized that Wang Chan was sitting on a stool in his room in a daze. Upon seeing Zhou Wen return, Wang Chan opened her mouth as though she wanted to say something, but in the end, she only said, “You’re back?”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen sat by the table and poured himself a cup of water.</p>
<p>“I-it’s nothing. I wanted to chat with you, but it’s already so late. I should be leaving. Let’s chat another time.” Wang Chan hesitated for a moment and ultimately didn’t say anything. She got up and prepared to leave.</p>
<p>She had been engaging in an intense psychological battle today. Although Wang Chan wanted to prove that Zhou Wen wouldn’t meet with misfortune because of her even if Xiao Si and Wang Lu weren’t by her side, Wang Chan still lacked confidence in herself after struggling internally for so long. She wasn’t willing to let Zhou Wen take the risk.</p>
<p>“Are you free tomorrow?” Zhou Wen suddenly asked Wang Chan.</p>
<p>“I’m free,” Wang Chan answered subconsciously.</p>
<p>“I want to visit the nearby dimensional zones tomorrow, but I’m not familiar with the roads. Can you take me there?” Zhou Wen asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“To a dimensional zone?” Wang Chan was first delighted before her expression dimmed. She shook her head and said, “It’s best you get my sister to accompany you.”</p>
<p>“Your sister isn’t free. Aren’t you free? Can’t you accompany me?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“My luck isn’t too good. I’m afraid that going to a dimensional zone with you will bring you bad luck,” Wang Chan said with her head lowered.</p>
<p>“What a coincidence. My luck isn’t good either. Two negatives make a positive. Perhaps my luck will improve,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“My luck is really bad. If you were by my side, you would be very unlucky and might die. I’m serious. I’m not joking,” Wang Chan said as she bit her lip.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen laughed and raised the saber in his hand in front of Wang Chan. “Do you know the name of this blade?”</p>
<p>Wang Chan sized up the Bamboo Blade in Zhou Wen’s hand in puzzlement. After a while, she said in surprise, “Could it be that this is the Bamboo Blade of the Four Gentlemen Blades? Is this a replica?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. This is the authentic Bamboo Blade. Previously, its owner died. Perhaps it’s because I’m so unlucky that it ended up being compatible with me. I’ve always been safe. Don’t worry. I’m hardy, so I’m not afraid of these things. Go back and rest. We’ll head to the Great Wall tomorrow morning to take a look,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Then… Alright…” Wang Chan thought for a moment and felt that it was safer to go to the Great Wall.</p>
<p>There were Undying Battle Souls at Great Wall City, and they ranged from the Mortal stage to the Epic stage. However, dimensional creatures like Undying Battle Souls were very strange. They only wandered the Great Wall. Humans couldn’t harm them and they didn’t seem to have any consciousness either. They only wandered on the Great Wall and wouldn’t attack humans.</p>
<p>In fact, even if they attacked humans, it was useless. Just like how humans couldn’t touch them, they also couldn’t touch humans.</p>
<p>Wang Chan heaved a sigh of relief when she heard that Zhou Wen wanted to go to the Great Wall. Even if something unfortunate happened there, it wouldn’t be too bad.</p>
<p>After Wang Chan returned, Zhou Wen lay in bed and launched his newly downloaded Ancient Sword Tomb dungeon.</p>
<p>The Ancient Sword Tomb dungeon looked desolate. At a glance, it was a series of undulating hills. However, upon closer inspection, one would realize that they weren’t hills at all. Instead, they were graves of all sizes.</p>
<p>Some graves were relatively small, like small mounds. Some of them were hundreds of feet tall, like continuous hills.</p>
<p>However, it was different from ancient human graves. There were no tombstones in front of the graves. At the highest point of each grave was a sword.</p>
<p>The swords on every grave were different. There were short swords, long swords, heavy swords, metal swords, jade swords, swords carved from bones, and porcelain swords made of mud.</p>
<p>There were all sorts of swords that dazzled one’s eyes. Every sword was embedded into a grave, a tombstone in some uncommon fashion.</p>
<p>Although few outsiders had the chance to enter the Ancient Sword Tomb other than Xia family members, it was a famous dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Xia Jiuhuang’s first Mythical Companion Beast came from the Ancient Sword Tomb.</p>
<p>Back then, there were only a handful of Mythical pets in the hands of humans. Xia Jiuhuang dominated the world with his sword and fought for the Federation citizens.</p>
<p>The six heroes were like gods to humans.</p>
<p>Of course, no one knew of the existence of Mythical Companion Beasts back then. They only knew that Xia Jiuhuang’s sword was very powerful, but they didn’t know that it was a Mythical Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Later on, the Xia family became famous for using swords. Most sword-type Companion Beasts came from the Ancient Sword Tomb.</p>
<p>Some people even suspected that Primordial Sword Immortal came from the Ancient Sword Tomb, but no one from the Xia family had admitted to it.</p>
<p>There was something else that left Zhou Wen puzzled. For some reason, he hadn’t seen Xia Jiuhuang use a Mythical Companion Beast when he fought him.</p>
<p>As he walked in the Ancient Sword Tomb, Zhou Wen looked around. He had only heard An Sheng mention that unless one reached out to pluck a sword in the Ancient Sword Tomb, they would remain dead objects. The swords didn’t emit any aura or power, making it impossible to gauge their levels.</p>
<p>Only by pulling them out could one know their true level and strength.</p>
<p>Drawing a sword was also a skill. This was because one didn’t know the stats, abilities, and level of a sword. If one was lacking in strength, pulling out a high-level sword might very well result in death.</p>
<p>However, if one was strong, killing a low-level dimensional creature as a result of their draw would be useless.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know much about swords, nor did he plan on choosing one. He reached out and grabbed the vine sword stuck in the tiny grave beside him, hoping to pull it out.</p>
<p>This was because the sword grave had a strange force field that protected the swords embedded in the grave. If he wanted to destroy the swords here, he had to pull them out first.</p>
<p>However, after Zhou Wen exerted his strength twice, the vine sword seemed to have taken root and wasn’t pulled out by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but carefully size up the vine sword. He saw that it looked like it was carved from a grayish-black ancient vine. The blade was slightly curved, and it didn’t look sharp. It had a very odd shape.</p>
<p>Could it be that I encountered a big guy for my first draw? Zhou Wen spread his legs apart and gripped the hilt with both hands. Then, he gathered all his strength and pulled it upwards.</p>
<p>However, the vine sword remained motionless as though it had become one with the small grave.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed. His strength was already considered top-notch in the Epic stage, but even he couldn’t pull it out. This meant that the vine sword was definitely extraordinary. It might even be a Mythical dimensional creature.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth and got it to pull out the vine sword.</p>
<h3 id='chapter764'>Chapter 764: Light Concealment Sword</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth’s immense strength was boundless. As it held the vine sword in one hand, the vine sword appeared no different from a chopstick in its hand.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth exerted strength, but the vine sword remained motionless. It remained intact.</p>
<p>After exerting its strength twice, Tyrant Behemoth failed to move the sword. It lost its temper and grabbed the vine sword with both hands. It was as though it was plucking a river sprout as it used its pushed its feet down and its hands to pull upwards.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was surprised to discover that Tyrant Behemoth, who had used all its strength, was still unable to pull out the vine sword. Even though the tiny grave shook from its pulling, the vine sword remained motionless.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Zhou Wen was alarmed. He knew that he had definitely been lucky to encounter an extraordinary sword.</p>
<p>However, as he knew too little about the Ancient Sword Tomb, he didn’t know what this meant.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen got Tyrant Behemoth to activate Absolute Strength to forcefully pull out the vine sword with brute force.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>With Absolute Strength activated, Tyrant Behemoth’s body became even heavier as its feet sank into the ground.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth exerted strength in its arms and pulled.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was dumbfounded to discover that the surrounding sword graves of all sizes were trembling violently as though there was an earthquake.</p>
<p>However, despite the veins on Tyrant Behemoth’s body protruding as it pulled at the sword with all its might, the vine sword remained stuck in the tiny grave. It didn’t come out as though it had been entrenched.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth constantly exerted strength. Under the infusion of Absolute Strength’s terrifying and boundless strength, the surrounding sword graves shook more and more violently. The various embedded swords emitted sword hums. Instantly, ten thousand swords resonated as their humming reverberated everywhere.</p>
<p>Only the vine sword remained silent and was still intact.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that Tyrant Behemoth had exerted its strength to its limits. The entire Ancient Sword Tomb was almost on the brink of being overturned by an earthquake; yet, the vine sword remained intact. He knew that the possibility of pulling it out was very low.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he ordered Tyrant Behemoth to give up on the vine sword. He ran to a sword tomb to the side and pulled out the claymore from it.</p>
<p>The moment the claymore appeared, terrifying red flames spewed out from the sword. However, the flames were nothing in front of Tyrant Behemoth. They couldn’t even burn its fur. Tyrant Behemoth stuffed it into its mouth and chewed it a few times before swallowing it.</p>
<p>“Killed Epic creature, Fiery Claymore…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw the game notification, but the sword was swallowed by Tyrant Behemoth without leaving anything behind.</p>
<p>After Tyrant Behemoth released the vine sword, the Ancient Sword Tomb’s earthquake stopped and the ancient swords stopped buzzing. Tyrant Behemoth pulled out two ancient swords at the same time before smashing them together and snapping them.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth charged forward as it frantically drew swords and snapped them. There was no sword that could withstand a single strike from it. Soon, it had snapped almost forty swords.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept looking at the game’s notifications. Some dimensional crystals dropped, but the highest was at the Epic stage. He didn’t discover any Mythical swords.</p>
<p>There were tens of thousands of swords in the Ancient Sword Tomb. Tyrant Behemoth pulled them out one by one without encountering a situation with the vine sword again. They were all easily pulled out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was now certain that it wasn’t a problem with the Ancient Sword Tomb in-game, but that he had struck the lottery. The first sword he encountered was actually an extraordinary sword.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen didn’t know much about swords. No matter how he looked at it, the vine sword wasn’t outstanding. It looked similar to a withered vine.</p>
<p>After snapping nearly a hundred swords, Zhou Wen got Tyrant Behemoth to turn around and pull the vine sword again, but the outcome was the same. Tyrant Behemoth used all its strength, causing an earthquake in the Ancient Sword Tomb, but the vine sword remained motionless.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to temporarily give up on the vine sword. He got Tyrant Behemoth to continue pulling the other swords to see if he could gain anything.</p>
<p>As the swords were pulled out, one of the swords wasn’t snapped by Tyrant Behemoth. The sword flashed a divine light as it scratched Tyrant Behemoth’s palm and escaped.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed. Tyrant Behemoth still had Absolute Strength active; yet, the sword managed to injure Tyrant Behemoth. Although it had only scratched the surface, that was enough to prove its sharpness.</p>
<p>After the sword struggled free, it quickly circled around Tyrant Behemoth and occasionally released sword beams to attack it.</p>
<p>However, the sword beams were shattered by Tyrant Behemoth. They couldn’t injure it at all.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully looked at the sword. He could only see sword beams, but not the sword’s body. This surprised him even more. When he used Truth Listener’s power to observe it, he immediately realized that the sword was invisible.</p>
<p>The sword seemed to be transparent. He could only see the sword beam, but he couldn’t see the blade. However, Zhou Wen was certain that the sword had a physical body. It wasn’t a Spirit Body, nor was it a pure sword beam.</p>
<p>A transparent sword? Interesting. As Zhou Wen was sizing up the sword, he heard Tyrant Behemoth roar angrily.</p>
<p>The transparent sword flew very quickly. Tyrant Behemoth failed to catch up to it no matter how many times it attacked. In its rage, it unleashed the full might of Absolute Strength. The suction force that resembled a black hole immediately reduced the sword’s speed.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth charged over and grabbed the transparent sword. The transparent sword was extremely sharp as it sliced through Tyrant Behemoth’s palm, causing blood to drip down from the gaps between its fingers.</p>
<p>However, Tyrant Behemoth ignored it. It grabbed the transparent sword with both hands and used all its strength to snap it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t see what the transparent sword looked like, but he could see Tyrant Behemoth’s hands slowly descending. When the two claws were about to touch each other, there was a boom as though a tenacious steel plate had snapped.</p>
<p>In the next second, Zhou Wen saw a notification appear in-game.</p>
<p>‘Killed Mythical creature, Light Concealment Sword. Discovered Companion Egg.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was overjoyed. He had expected to encounter a Mythical sword, but to have a Companion Egg drop surprised him. After all, his luck wasn’t that good.</p>
<p>He sized up the area where the Light Concealment Sword snapped, but he didn’t see any Companion Eggs. He immediately came to a realization that perhaps Light Concealment Sword’s Companion Beast was also transparent and invisible.</p>
<p>He hurriedly swept the area with Truth Listener and immediately discovered the Companion Egg. It was beside Tyrant Behemoth’s huge foot, but he couldn’t see it with his eyes.</p>
<p>I already have the Invisibility Cloak, and now I’ve obtained a Light Concealment Sword. Could it be that I’m destined to become a peerless assassin? Zhou Wen thought happily as he picked up the Light Concealment Sword Companion Egg.</p>

<h3 id='chapter765'>Chapter 765: Three Swords of Ancient Times</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Light Concealment: Mythical</p>
<p>Life Providence: Invisible Sword</p>
<p>Life Soul: Invisible Sword Aura</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Light Concealment</p>
<p>Strength: 81</p>
<p>Speed: 81</p>
<p>Constitution: 80</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 81</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Sword Light Slash, Sword Light Wheel, Sword Light Rain, Integration Strike.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Sword</p>
<p>Although he didn’t know how the skills or Life Providence were, he knew solely from the stats that the Light Concealment Sword was a top-notch Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Apart from the one-point difference in Constitution, all of its stats were top-notch at the Mythical stage. They were stronger than the Golden Overlord Sword’s stats.</p>
<p>In-game, he tried out the Light Concealment Sword’s skill and slashed out a condensed sword beam. Its single-target destructive power was extremely powerful.</p>
<p>The Sword Light Wheel was a multitudinous light attack. It was considered a small AOE attack.</p>
<p>Sword Light Rain covered a large area, but its offensive strength was much weaker than a single Sword Light Slash.</p>
<p>However, if he used Slaughterer’s infinite Essence Energy to complement Sword Light Rain, it would be somewhat ludicrous.</p>
<p>Typical Sword Light Rain could only be used once before one was depleted of their Essence Energy. Even a Mythical creature’s Essence Energy stores were unable to withstand two or three rounds of expenditure.</p>
<p>However, Slaughterer’s infinite Essence Energy recovery allowed him to cast Sword Light Rain constantly. It was like a submachine gun with infinite bullets.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen studied the final Integration Strike for a while, but he failed to figure out what skill it was. It wasn’t an active offensive skill, so Zhou Wen didn’t understand its main effects.</p>
<p>The Invisible Sword Life Providence was the invisibility ability of the Light Concealment Sword. The Invisible Sword Aura Life Soul was rather interesting. Apart from a sword beam, the Light Concealment Sword could also emit an invisible sword aura. Others could only see the sword beam, but not the invisible sword aura. If one only blocked the sword beam, they would succumb to the Invisible Sword Aura. It was a very sinister Life Soul.</p>
<p>The effects of the Wheel of Destiny—Light Concealment—were somewhat strange. Zhou Wen needed to continue studying it. After using it, the Light Concealment Sword’s sword beams and sword aura would converge, causing its destructive power to decrease. He had yet to figure out its true use.</p>
<p>In short, Zhou Wen was very satisfied with the Light Concealment Sword. Coupled with the Invisibility Cloak, it was the best weapon to secretly defeat others.</p>
<p>In the past, if Zhou Wen had used the Golden Overlord Sword while wearing the Invisibility Cloak, he would be exposing a huge, golden sword. Even a blind person could see it.</p>
<p>Now that he had the Light Concealment Sword, the possibility of being seen was much lower.</p>
<p>The Light Concealment Sword is known as one of the Three Ancient Swords. From top to bottom grade, it went: Light Concealment Sword, Shadow Containment, and Night Training. If one can gather all three ancient swords and attack with all three in a fight, how impressive would that be? Zhou Wen got Tyrant Behemoth to continue drawing the swords.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>With this ferocious beast around, there was no need for the blood-colored avatar to do a thing. Zhou Wen released his luxurious Mythical pet lineup and got them to draw swords on their own.</p>
<p>The outcome wasn’t that good. Apart from obtaining the Light Concealment Sword in the beginning, the Companion Eggs that dropped had relatively low levels. He didn’t encounter any Mythical creatures.</p>
<p>Apart from that, quite a number of sword Essence Energy Skills dropped. Most of them were at the Legendary stage, with three at the Epic stage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen absorbed all the Essence Energy Skills. It was better than nothing.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The next morning, Wang Chan left the manor and prepared to head to the old courtyard to visit Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, just as she walked out of the Wang manor, she saw Xiao Si walking over.</p>
<p>“Little Chan, where are you going?” Xiao Si asked politely.</p>
<p>“As you wish. To a dimensional zone,” Wang Chan said with a cold expression.</p>
<p>“In that case, I’ll accompany you to prevent any accidents,” said Xiao Si.</p>
<p>Wang Chan curled her lips and said, “There’s no need. Don’t you claim that it was thanks to your Traversing Misfortune Buddha Body when nothing happens.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. My Traversing Misfortune Buddha Body can be controlled freely. I’ve already temporarily sealed him today. It won’t affect your Goddess of Misfortune Life Providence. Furthermore, by going with you, if there’s really excessive bad luck, I can stop it in time to prevent unnecessary casualties, especially your friend,” Xiao Si said.</p>
<p>“Up to you.” Wang Chan hesitated for a moment and didn’t stop Xiao Si from following.</p>
<p>She was really afraid that something would happen to Zhou Wen because of her. Furthermore, with Xiao Si around, if she could really prove that her bad luck wouldn’t affect Zhou Wen, she could also make Xiao Si see the truth and give up on the idea.</p>
<p>As she was taking Xiao Si with her, Wang Chan didn’t go to the old courtyard again. That was where Grandma Wang rested. Not to mention outsiders, even members of the Wang family weren’t allowed to go there for no reason. Wang Chan naturally wouldn’t take Xiao Si with her.</p>
<p>After agreeing to meet Zhou Wen at the Great Wall, Wang Chan quickly headed to their meeting point.</p>
<p>Xiao Si followed Wang Chan mainly because he wanted to know who was influencing her. He had already gotten the Xiao family to investigate, but they hadn’t found out anything due to the short amount of time provided. Furthermore, no one from Sunset College had come to the Wang family recently.</p>
<p>When he messaged Wang Chan, Zhou Wen knew that she would be bringing Xiao Si along. Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised. Even if Wang Chan refused to bring Xiao Si along, Xiao Si would probably still meet them by accident.</p>
<p>“Brother-in-law, you’re here.” Zhou Wen arrived at the appointed spot. When Wang Chan saw him, she immediately ran over. However, her form of address left Zhou Wen slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen immediately understood why Wang Chan called him that without using his name.</p>
<p>Now, the Xia family and the bureau were still investigating the changes in the Forbidden City. If they knew that Zhou Wen had left the Forbidden City, it would naturally be very troublesome.</p>
<p>Wang Chan deliberately didn’t call Zhou Wen by his name because she didn’t want Xiao Si to know his true identity as a way to prevent him from causing trouble.</p>
<p>It’s quite impressive to be aware of such things at such a young age. Zhou Wen marveled inwardly. He wasn’t so meticulous back when he was as old as Wang Chan.</p>
<p>“Little Chan, is he your brother-in-law?” Wang Chan’s address of Zhou Wen left Xiao Si slightly taken aback as he asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“My sister’s boyfriend. If I don’t call him brother-in-law, what else can I call him?” Wang Chan curled her lips and said.</p>
<p>Xiao Si sized up Zhou Wen and saw that his face was still covered in bandages and he was wearing a hat. It was impossible to tell what he looked like.</p>
<p>“I’m Xiao Si from Chiang Rai…” Xiao Si took the initiative to introduce himself. He mainly wanted to know who this man was.</p>
<p>Wang Lu was different from Wang Chan. Wang Lu could be said to be the heir apparent of the Wang family. It was impossible for the Wang family to let her marry outsiders, much less allow her Goddess of Luck Life Providence to go to waste.</p>
<p>The Wang family would definitely carefully filter the people who could become Wang Lu’s partner.</p>
<p>Now that Wang Chan had called Zhou Wen brother-in-law, Xiao Si was momentarily unsure of Zhou Wen’s origins.</p>
<h3 id='chapter766'>Chapter 766: Undying Battle Soul</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Wei Ge, most people call me Brother.” Zhou Wen extended his hand and shook Xiao Si’s hand.</p>
<p>Xiao Si secretly remembered this name, but he naturally wouldn’t call him “Brother.” He planned on investigating Wei Ge’s background after he returned.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In an office of the Imperial Capital Special Inspector Bureau’s headquarters, Wei Ge, who was drinking tea, suddenly sneezed. He rubbed his nose and muttered to himself, “Who’s thinking of me?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Cut it out. Brother-in-law, didn’t you want to go to the Great Wall? Let’s go.” Wang Chan pulled Zhou Wen towards the stairs at the entrance of the Great Wall.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been searching outside the Great Wall for a long time, but he couldn’t find the tiny palm symbol. However, he remained adamant about giving up—he wanted to search while on the Great Wall.</p>
<p>After all, dimensional creatures like Undying Battle Souls had very rare characteristics. Such dimensional creatures might be very useful.</p>
<p>Wang Chan was still somewhat uneasy, afraid that her Goddess of Misfortune would endanger Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Xiao Si tailed them while constantly wearing a smile on his face. However, he was sneering inwardly. Do you think you’ll really be safe after coming to a place like the Great Wall? How naive.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hadn’t ascended the Great Wall yesterday and had only searched its exterior. Therefore, he hadn’t seen the Undying Battle Souls. After ascending the Great Wall, he finally knew what kind of existence the Battle Souls were.</p>
<p>On the ancient city wall, soldiers in armor wandered aimlessly as though they had no mind or soul.</p>
<p>Their attire looked ancient. Furthermore, these soldiers were like virtual projections. Their bodies were translucent. When Zhou Wen reached out to grab an Undying Battle Soul’s arm, his palm passed through the Battle Soul’s body as though it was only an illusion and not a real creature.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen condensed his Essence Energy and attempted to attack the Undying Battle Souls but to no avail. All sorts of Essence Energy Skills penetrated the Undying Battle Soul’s bodies, leaving them unaffected.</p>
<p>An Undying Battle Soul wandered over and passed through Zhou Wen and company as it continued wandering forward.</p>
<p>These Undying Battle Souls are quite interesting. They look similar to the Ghost Bride that has a Spirit Body, but they seem a little different. Zhou Wen sized up the Undying Battle Souls with interest.</p>
<p>This was clearly the first time Wang Chan had seen an Undying Battle Soul. She was very curious and reached out to grab it, but it was naturally futile.</p>
<p>“I’ve only heard that Undying Battle Souls were very magical in the past. I’m finally seeing it today.” Wang Chan was very happy. This was because Undying Battle Souls indeed couldn’t harm anyone, so she didn’t have to worry about Zhou Wen being affected by her bad luck.</p>
<p>Xiao Si looked at the Undying Battle Souls, his eyes flashing with a strange, indiscernible look.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen searched for the tiny palm symbol along the way, but Wang Chan treated it as a vacation. However, the scenery of the Great Wall was too monotonous. All there was to see other than the city walls were Undying Battle Souls.</p>
<p>Such a scenery became a little boring after a long time.</p>
<p>As they walked, they suddenly saw black smoke rising in front of them.</p>
<p>Looking in the direction of the rising black smoke, they saw that it was coming out from a beacon tower.</p>
<p>The so-called beacon towers were actually the place where signals were transmitted in ancient times.</p>
<p>In ancient times, there were no modern signaling stations, nor were there any radio or satellites to transmit signals over distances. They could only rely on producing smoke to allow people in the distance to see the signal.</p>
<p>Therefore, there would be a beacon tower built at certain distances on the Great Wall to deliver information quickly.</p>
<p>This was also the main purpose of the Great Wall. Although the Great Wall was tall and majestic, its main purpose wasn’t for war. Apart from the beacon tower’s ability to transmit information, the Great Wall’s main purpose was to block trade and information transmission.</p>
<p>However, in modern times, the Great Wall was basically useless. After the dimensional storms, there were very few humans who could reach the Great Wall, much less ignite the flames of war.</p>
<p>To suddenly have smoke rising from the beacon tower on the Great Wall made Wang Chan’s heart skip a beat as she felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Rising smoke from the nearby beacon tower looked like a black tornado rushing into the sky from afar.</p>
<p>What was even stranger was that the soulless Battle Souls seemed to awaken all of a sudden. Their eyes glowed red as they swarmed towards the beacon tower.</p>
<p>“Brother-in-law, something seems amiss. Let’s leave quickly.” Wang Chan pulled Zhou Wen and wanted to leave the Great Wall. She was really afraid that something would happen.</p>
<p>However, when they retreated, they didn’t see any stairs that led them away from the Great Wall.</p>
<p>The Great Wall had already transformed into a dimensional zone. It was impossible to jump off the city wall. Although one could also jump out of the city wall, the dimensional zone’s power would take effect. One would be bound by a mysterious force. The further one was from the Great Wall, the greater the force.</p>
<p>It would be as if one had a powerful spring attached to them. In the end, they would be pulled back to the Great Wall. Only by taking the stairs could one truly leave the Great Wall.</p>
<p>“No… How can it not be here… It was clearly here…” Wang Chan looked left and right, almost crying from anxiety.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. Since we can’t get out, I might as well see what’s on the beacon tower,” Zhou Wen said as he walked towards it.</p>
<p>Although Wang Chan was very worried, she had no choice but to follow Zhou Wen to the beacon tower.</p>
<p>Xiao Si said from the side, “I’ve already said that only my Traversing Misfortune Buddha Body can give you peace of mind. No one else can.”</p>
<p>Wang Chan pretended not to hear him as she quickly walked to Zhou Wen’s side.</p>
<p>Soon, the trio came to a nearby beacon tower. They saw a strange container emitting copious amounts of black smoke. The nearby Undying Battle Souls were throwing themselves into the container.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised to discover that the black smoke was produced by seemingly burning the Undying Battle Souls.</p>
<p>He turned around and looked at the other beacon towers nearby, but he didn’t see any smoke from them. Only this one had smoke rising from it.</p>
<p>He carefully sized up the container. It was a two-handled pot. It was completely black, but it wasn’t made of gold or jade. It looked more like a lacquered container.</p>
<p>There were some mysterious patterns engraved on the pot, but Zhou Wen couldn’t understand them.</p>
<p>As more and more Undying Battle Souls threw themselves into the pot, the patterns on the pot gradually lit up as though there was some evil aura flowing through them.</p>
<p>All the nearby Undying Battle Souls had already thrown themselves into the pot. The black smoke stopped spewing out and the pot shook violently.</p>
<p>Suddenly, something shot out from the pot. When Wang Chan saw what it was, her expression changed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter767'>Chapter 767: Silver-Winged Yaksha</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Silver-Winged Yaksha! Why is there a Silver-Winged Yaksha on the Great Wall!?” Wang Chan cried out in horror.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned as he stared at the creature that came out of the pot. He saw that it was an evil ghost with wings on its back. Its entire body seemed to be forged from silver, but its blood-red eyes shimmered. It looked extremely sinister and bizarre.</p>
<p>He was certain that it was a dimensional creature and not a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had actually heard of Silver-Winged Yakshas. Not long after the dimensional storms, a few Silver-Winged Yakshas had appeared in some coastal cities.</p>
<p>As Silver-Winged Yakshas were extremely bloodthirsty, they would bring a terrifying calamity to humanity every time they appeared. Some places suffered massacres.</p>
<p>However, in the past twenty to thirty years, Silver-Winged Yakshas rarely appeared. It was even more so in a place like the Imperial Capital.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had only heard that Silver-Winged Yakshas were terrifying. It was possible that it was a Mythical creature, but he had never seen one before.</p>
<p>“Brother-in-law, run!” Wang Chan pulled Zhou Wen and ran. She knew very well how terrifying Silver-Winged Yakshas were.</p>
<p>This was because the Wang family had a video of the Silver-Winged Yaksha’s massacre of a small city. Not only was the Silver-Winged Yaksha a Mythical creature, but it was also extremely fast. Its physique and strength were equally terrifying. Typically, humans wouldn’t even be able to see it before they were beheaded.</p>
<p>Now, Wang Chan regretted bringing Zhou Wen into the dimensional zone. If they had not come here, they wouldn’t have encountered such trouble.</p>
<p>“I’ve already said that you shouldn’t have come out with others. Only I can stop you from being embroiled by bad luck,” said Xiao Si.</p>
<p>At that moment, Xiao Si was feeling very pleased with himself. The Silver-Winged Yaksha naturally didn’t appear here for no reason. Although it wasn’t a Companion Beast but a genuine dimensional creature, this didn’t mean that no one could control it.</p>
<p>In fact, the person who released the Silver-Winged Yaksha was Xiao Si himself. However, the Silver-Winged Yaksha wasn’t his pet. He couldn’t command the Silver-Winged Yaksha, so the reason for its appearance was the two-handled pot.</p>
<p>The pot itself was a magical item. It had the title of Devil’s Pot in the South District. It was a treasure that was obtained from a mysterious dimensional zone in the South District before it ended up in the Xiao family’s hands.</p>
<p>There were no true devils in the Devil’s Pot, but they could seal certain types of dimensional creatures inside.</p>
<p>The Xiao family had paid a considerable price to find a Silver-Winged Yaksha and place it inside the Devil’s Pot.</p>
<p>Although they couldn’t control the Silver-Winged Yaksha, they could selectively release or seal it.</p>
<p>In other words, after Xiao Si controlled the Devil’s Pot, he had the ability to release or retrieve the Silver-Winged Yaksha.</p>
<p>Silver-Winged Yakshas were extremely bloodthirsty. They would engage in wanton slaughter the moment they were released. Their only weakness was that they didn’t distinguish between friend and foe. Typically, they would only choose humans and souls as their targets.</p>
<p>Although the Devil’s Pot wasn’t of much help in cracking dimensional zones, it was a great weapon when used against humans.</p>
<p>Although Xiao Si told Wang Chan that he could control his Life Providence, it was actually impossible. Therefore, as long as he was by her side, Wang Chan’s Goddess of Misfortune Life Providence wouldn’t have much effect.</p>
<p>Xiao Si had no intention of letting Wang Chan’s Life Providence take effect. He didn’t like uncertain factors and wanted everything to be under his control.</p>
<p>Roar! After the Silver-Winged Yaksha came out of the Devil’s Pot, it let out a shocking roar. Silver light erupted from its body as a terrifying shockwave blasted out hundreds of meters away, causing Wang Chan and Xiao Si to fall to the ground.</p>
<p>In the next second, the Silver-Winged Yaksha spread its wings and instantly traversed a distance of hundreds of meters. It appeared in front of Zhou Wen who was still standing there. Its aura was extremely violent, like a devil from hell.</p>
<p>“No…” Wang Chan was extremely regretful. She regretted bringing Zhou Wen out. She regretted having the extravagant hopes of making friends at school like an ordinary girl.</p>
<p>Xiao Si pretended to fall to the ground, but his eyes were filled with killing intent. No one knows that the Devil’s Pot and the Silver-Winged Yaksha belong to our Xiao family. No matter who this fellow is, no one will be able to pin the blame on me if he’s killed by the Silver-Winged Yaksha. Without him, everything will return to normal… Wang Chan will eventually join my Xiao family…</p>
<p>As the two of them had different thoughts, they suddenly saw Zhou Wen draw the saber at his waist and slash at the Silver-Winged Yaksha.</p>
<p>Xiao Si sneered inwardly. A terrifying existence like the Silver-Winged Yaksha has devoured so many Undying Battle Souls. How can a human’s saber match it…</p>
<p>“Brother-in-law, I’m sorry…” Wang Chan shouted loudly. Her heart was filled with regret and frustration. Tears fell from the corners of her eyes as she thought sadly, I shouldn’t have had such extravagant hopes…</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>However, in the next second, Xiao Si and Wang Chan widened their eyes in shock.</p>
<p>The Silver-Winged Yaksha was split into two by the Bamboo Blade as it slammed to the ground.</p>
<p>“No… Impossible…” Xiao Si’s mouth gaped open as he looked at Zhou Wen and the Silver-Winged Yasha’s corpse at his feet in disbelief. He couldn’t believe that the Mythical Silver-Winged Yaksha had died just like that.</p>
<p>Wang Chan was also stunned. Her face was still covered in tears, but her expression had turned extremely odd. She hadn’t completely restrained her sorrowful expression, yet it was mixed with a flabbergasted look.</p>
<p>“What did you say?” Zhou Wen picked up a silver egg-shaped object from the Silver-Winged Yaksha’s corpse and turned to ask Wang Chan.</p>
<p>“N-nothing… Brother-in-law… You’re amazing… Is this the Silver-Winged Yaksha’s Companion Egg?” Wang Chan’s forlorn look turned into a smile as she jumped up from the ground and tugged at Zhou Wen with a look of joy.</p>
<p>“I guess so. However, such a weak dimensional creature is probably very weak as a Companion Beast. It’s useless. If you like it, you can have it.” Zhou Wen casually threw the Silver-Winged Yaksha Companion Egg towards Wang Chan.</p>
<p>The corners of Xiao Si’s eyes twitched. He wished he could slap Zhou Wen twice.</p>
<p>That was the Silver-Winged Yaksha. The Xiao family had sealed the Silver-Winged Yaksha for so long, but they had failed to come up with a way to kill it. They never expected such good luck to have the Silver-Winged Yaksha drop a Companion Egg after its death.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that Zhou Wen had killed the Silver-Winged Yaksha and had a Companion Egg drop, he even complained that the Silver-Winged Yaksha was too weak. This left Xiao Si gnashing his teeth in anger.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to care about Xiao Si’s expression. His figure phased away and vanished.</p>
<p>Not good! Xiao Si was alarmed. He had already guessed where Zhou Wen had gone.</p>
<p>Although the Silver-Winged Yaksha was difficult to seal, there was still a chance of sealing another in the future. It didn’t matter if it died, but if Zhou Wen took away the Devil’s Pot, everything would be over.</p>
<p>Xiao Si hurriedly ordered his Life Soul to retrieve the Devil’s Pot. He was still very confident in his Life Soul. After all, he had used his Life Soul to silently place the Devil’s Pot on the beacon tower.</p>
<h3 id='chapter768'>Chapter 768: Kuman Thong Life Soul</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal was extremely fast, allowing him to instantly arrive at the beacon tower.</p>
<p>The two-handled pot was still on the beacon tower, but it was swaying as though it had been moved by something before disappearing.</p>
<p>Truth Listener could hear the sounds of motion and determine where an object was, but it couldn’t outline an exact shape.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen activated the Holy Hell King Life Soul and opened the Eye of the Holy Hell King. Immediately, he saw a child running with the two-handled Devil’s Pot.</p>
<p>The child was much smaller than Demonic Neonate, but the sinflames on his body were very rich.</p>
<p>The child turned his head to look at Zhou Wen, leaving him slightly taken aback. The child’s facial features were very blurry as though he hadn’t grown up. His body was also very strange. His stomach was huge, but his limbs were tiny. He was indescribably terrifying and bizarre.</p>
<p>Activating the Eye of the Holy Hell King, a force swallowed the invisible child into the Eye of the Holy Hell King. The child seemed to be made of pure sinflames so he was directly absorbed and refined to nothingness.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could even sense that his Holy Hell King Life Soul had made significant progress. If he could have more of these Life Souls, he might be able to successfully evolve a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>After the child was absorbed and refined, the Devil’s Pot that had disappeared immediately dropped to the ground. At the same time, Zhou Wen heard a tragic cry. He saw Xiao Si spew out a mouthful of blood as the color in his face drained. It was as though he had suffered a fatal blow.</p>
<p>The destruction of Xiao Si’s Life Soul was naturally a severe blow to him. He had dropped from the Epic stage to the Legendary stage, astounding and infuriating him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen grabbed the Devil’s Pot and with a flash, he returned to Wang Chan’s side. He stared at Xiao Si, who was about to escape, and said, “This is yours, right?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? How can that crappy pot be mine?” Xiao Si immediately shook his head and said.</p>
<p>“I originally wanted to give you a chance to live. Since you aren’t appreciating it, there’s no need to say anything else,” Zhou Wen said as he prepared to draw his Bamboo Blade.</p>
<p>“Wait! What do you want?” Xiao Si was terrified, but he still pretended to be calm.</p>
<p>He had seen Zhou Wen kill the Silver-Winged Yaksha with a single blow and knew how terrifying Zhou Wen’s strength was. As for the Life Soul that Xiao Si had relied on and others couldn’t see, it had been killed by Zhou Wen. He had lost his composure.</p>
<p>“Answer a few of my questions. If your answers satisfy me, I can consider letting you live,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Ask whatever you want to know. However, that Devil’s Pot has nothing to do with me,” Xiao Si said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“Alright, so you were the one behind this. I thought it was me…” Wang Chan also understood what had happened and glared at Xiao Si angrily.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pulled her behind him and looked at Xiao Si. “I don’t care if it has anything to do with you. Tell me the origins of this pot and what use does it have?”</p>
<p>“This pot is named Devil’s Pot in the South District. You’ll know once you ask around. It can seal certain special dimensional creatures.” As Xiao Si answered, his fingers moved in his sleeve.</p>
<p>“How can I control this pot?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“It’s very simple.” Xiao Si explained the usage of the Devil’s Pot.</p>
<p>“That child was your Life Soul, right? What’s his name? What’s his use?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>He was very interested in Xiao Si’s Life Soul. For a Life Soul to have so many sinflames—even more than the sinflames on Xiao Si’s body—made no sense.</p>
<p>“Kuman Thong. It’s a relatively common Life Soul in Chiang Rai. As long as one cultivates the Kuman Thong Essence Energy Art, they will have a Kuman Thong Life Soul. However, their abilities will be slightly different,” Xiao Si said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up when he heard that. He stared at Xiao Si and asked, “Does that mean that many people in Chiang Rai have Kuman Thong Life Souls?”</p>
<p>“It’s not just Chiang Rai. Many Epic experts in the nearby regions have Kuman Thong Life Souls,” Xiao Si answered readily.</p>
<p>“One last question. Why do you want to take Wang Chan to the Xiao family?” Zhou Wen stared at Xiao Si and asked.</p>
<p>“Of course, I wish to obtain the Wang family’s help to make our Xiao family…” Before Xiao Si could finish his sentence, Zhou Wen had already unsheathed his Bamboo Blade.</p>
<p>A saber beam flashed. Before Xiao Si and Wang Chan could see what was happening, the Bamboo Blade had already returned to its scabbard.</p>
<p>“You… You said you wouldn’t kill me…” Xiao Si’s expression changed drastically as he hurriedly covered his neck with his hand. However, the moment his hand touched his neck, a bloody mark appeared on his originally normal neck. Then, blood gushed out. He couldn’t stop the blood no matter how hard he tried.</p>
<p>“I said that I could let you live if I was satisfied with your answer. Now, I’m very unsatisfied with your answer, so I refuse to give you a way out,” Zhou Wen said matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>“You…” Xiao Si opened his mouth, but at that moment, his mouth was filled with blood. He couldn’t say a word. He fell to the ground and twitched a few times before he died.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used the sheathed Bamboo Blade to pry open his palm and saw a strange plaque in his hand. It was black, but it looked like the bone of some creature. The plaque had a mysterious engraving, and the necklace connected to the plaque was made using many strange materials. He was unsure what it was.</p>
<p>“This is a Buddha plaque.” Wang Chan recognized what it was.</p>
<p>“What’s a Buddha plaque? One used to honor Buddha?” Zhou Wen really didn’t know what a Buddha plaque was.</p>
<p>“No, a Buddha plaque is a dimensional artifact created by some Epic experts in the South District using dimensional materials. Typically, it’s made from the bones of a dimensional creature before forcefully sealing a Companion Beast inside the Buddha plaque. This way, the Buddha plaque will have the power of a Companion Beast, but it doesn’t have a master. As long as a special method is used, anyone can use the power of the Companion Beast inside the Buddha plaque. This will allow some Mortal stage or even ordinary people who have never cultivated to borrow the power of a Companion Beast,” Wang Chan said.</p>
<p>“There’s actually such a magical technique. Why hasn’t the Federation promoted such a technique?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>It allowed ordinary people to use the power of high-level Companion Beasts. This technique was just extremely powerful.</p>
<p>“Companion Beasts sealed in the Buddha plaque can only use a portion of their strength. Furthermore, when used by ordinary people, there will be many taboos. A single mistake will result in a backlash. The average person wouldn’t choose such a method to control a Companion Beast. This is similar to the Kuman Thong Life Soul. The Kuman Thong Life Soul is also a Life Soul that allows quick formation. As long as the correct method is used, it’s very easy to condense a Kuman Thong Life Soul. However, the method of condensing the Kuman Thong is very cruel. Furthermore, like the Buddha plaque, it’s easy for it to negatively affect its owner. Therefore, other than a certain area in the South District, there are very few people who cultivate the Kuman Thong Life Soul. I never expected that this b*stard, Xiao Si, would cultivate the Kuman Thong Life Soul. Furthermore, it’s in the form of a child. Damn it.” Wang Chan kicked Xiao Si’s corpse hatefully.</p>
<h3 id='chapter769'>Chapter 769: Cherish the Opportunity</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen picked up the Buddha plaque in Xiao Si’s hand with his sword. For Xiao Si to use the Buddha plaque against Zhou Wen despite having seen his strength, it was likely that the Buddha plaque had extraordinary strength, so Zhou Wen was rather careful.</p>
<p>After the dimensional storms, there were too many mysterious powers in the world. Zhou Wen wasn’t arrogant enough to believe that he was invincible just because he had some achievements.</p>
<p>If he was not careful, this tiny Buddha plaque might become his death warrant.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully sized up the Buddha plaque and couldn’t see anything amiss. All he felt was that there was some invisible evil aura lingering on it.</p>
<p>However, this evil aura didn’t seem to have any effect.</p>
<p>This was because the Buddha plaque needed a special method to be used. Zhou Wen didn’t know how to use it, nor was he able to activate the Companion Beast in the Buddha plaque. After fiddling with it for a while and seeing that it was useless, he put it away.</p>
<p>He searched Xiao Si’s body again. Apart from a few Buddha plaques, there was nothing else of value.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen put away the Buddha plaques and summoned the Fire Furnace Queen to burn Xiao Si’s corpse to ashes.</p>
<p>“Let’s return.” Zhou Wen took Wang Chan back to the Wang family’s courtyard and went to see Grandma Wang. He recounted the entire process in detail, but he didn’t explain much.</p>
<p>Grandma Wang listened attentively without saying a word. After she finished listening, she asked Zhou Wen and Wang Chan a few questions.</p>
<p>“Little Zhou, you’ve done well. You’ve helped our Wang family greatly and saved Little Chan. I’ll just keep it short. I need to gather the core members of the Wang family to discuss our response. Although the Xiao family’s forces aren’t comparable to our Wang family and are far away in the South District, their Companion Beasts and various skills are somewhat special. We have to be wary of them. Also, don’t tell anyone about this matter. Just treat it as though it never happened. Leave everything to our Wang family,” Grandma Wang said to Zhou Wen after some thought.</p>
<p>“I killed him. If there’s anything you need me for, just tell me,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Good child, since you call me Grandma, I won’t stand on ceremony with you. I’ll think of you when I need you. Go back with Little Chan now. Do what you need to do and pretend nothing has happened,” Grandma Wang said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Wang Chan left the hall. Wang Chan looked at Zhou Wen in delight and said, “Zhou Wen, thank you. If it weren’t for you, I would have been fooled by that detestable fellow. Now, I can finally be at ease.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head and said, “Your sister helped me a lot. In comparison, what I did was nothing. You don’t have to take it to heart.”</p>
<p>With that said, Zhou Wen turned around and returned to his room.</p>
<p>Since the Wang family already knew of the Xiao family’s intentions towards Wang Chan, they would naturally be wary in the future. Zhou Wen didn’t need to continue interfering.</p>
<p>As Wang Chan watched Zhou Wen enter the room, she held the Silver-Winged Yaksha Companion Egg in hand. She wanted to stop him, but when she opened her mouth, she closed it again.</p>
<p>“Humph, Sister is right. This Numbskull Wen is pretty nice, but he isn’t good with words.” Wang Chan put the Silver-Winged Yaksha Companion Egg back into her pocket.</p>
<p>She originally wanted to return it to Zhou Wen. After all, she had no way of incubating such a Mythical Companion Egg. It was useless even if she took it. Furthermore, she wasn’t someone who would take things from others.</p>
<p>If she really wanted a Mythical Companion Egg, it wouldn’t be difficult for her with her having an elder sister like Wang Lu around.</p>
<p>Despite that, Wang Chan changed her mind and didn’t return the Companion Egg to Zhou Wen. Instead, she returned to the Wang family with it.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Wang Lu already knew what had happened. After Wang Chan returned, she asked her in private, “Little Chan, are you alright?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine. Thankfully, Zhou Wen was there. Otherwise, I would have been fooled by that b*stard Xiao Si. Now, I finally know that my misfortune Life Providence might not necessarily bring misfortune to everyone. At the very least, Zhou Wen isn’t affected by my misfortune,” Wang Chan said.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Wang Lu smiled and said, “It’s good that you think that way. Your Life Providence is nothing much.”</p>
<p>“By the way, Sister, do you like that Numbskull Wen?” Wang Chan asked.</p>
<p>“How can that be? We are just classmates with a better relationship,” Wang Lu hurriedly said.</p>
<p>“I see. Then, sister, you have to cherish this opportunity,” Wang Chan said.</p>
<p>“What do you mean cherish the opportunity? No one wants such a boring man. It would be strange if he had a girlfriend,” Wang Lu said with a twitch of her lips.</p>
<p>“That might be the case. I think Numbskull Wen isn’t bad. If you don’t want him, I’ll be his girlfriend when I grow up.” With that said, Wang Chan carried the Companion Egg back to her room.</p>
<p>Wang Lu was taken aback. She hadn’t expected Wang Chan to say that.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen returned to his room, he continued grinding the Ancient Sword Tomb. He was still thinking about the Shadow Containment Sword and Night Training Sword.</p>
<p>However, the Ancient Sword Tomb was just too huge. Most ancient swords were at the Mortal and Legendary stage. It wasn’t easy to find an Epic, much less a Mythical.</p>
<p>After grinding for a few hours, none of the ancient swords destroyed were at the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the vine sword was still there. Zhou Wen had tried all sorts of methods to pull out the sword, but the outcome was the same. He couldn’t pull it out no matter what.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t take out the Buddha plaques to study them because he was afraid that there were special settings on them. It wouldn’t be good if the Xiao family traced the clues to him.</p>
<p>Placing them in the chaos space was equivalent to them being in another space. It severed all connections with the outside world. No matter how powerful the Xiao family was, it was impossible for them to find those Buddha plaques.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen planned on studying the Buddha plaques after leaving the Imperial Capital.</p>
<p>His only regret in coming to the Imperial Capital was that he couldn’t download the Great Wall instance dungeon. However, Zhou Wen already roughly knew that the Undying Battle Soul was a soul-type creature. It wasn’t that he couldn’t kill it, but he needed some special powers.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The anomaly in Forbidden City continued as lightning continued to fall from the heavens, turning Forbidden City into a city of lightning. However, the lightning was limited to the city, so it didn’t affect the Imperial Capital much.</p>
<p>Some people had already attempted to enter Forbidden City to explore the situation inside, but the outcome was terrible. Be it Companion Beasts or humans, people immediately lost contact with them upon their entry into Forbidden City. Up to now, no one had survived.</p>
<p>What exactly is the woman inside that log? What’s her relationship with the antelope? Why would it let me carry her into Forbidden City? Zhou Wen thought for a long time but failed to come up with an answer.</p>
<p>He asked the antelope, but it kept looking at him with a strange expression. He couldn’t tell what it meant. It looked a little like pity, regret, contempt, and a hint of gloating. In short, Zhou Wen’s hair stood on end every time he looked at it, but the antelope didn’t give him an answer.</p>
<h3 id='chapter770'>Chapter 770: In front of the Earth Temple</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>In the next few days, Zhou Wen went to some dimensional zones in the Imperial Capital, but he didn’t gain anything. He didn’t discover the tiny palm symbols.</p>
<p>The Wang family had already settled the matter regarding the Xiao family. Although they had temporarily appeased the Xiao family, it was ultimately a hidden danger.</p>
<p>The Xiao family’s interest in Wang Chan probably wouldn’t stop because of Xiao Si’s death. The Wang family also wanted to figure out the cause of this matter. If possible, they even wanted to directly eliminate the Xiao family and eliminate this future trouble.</p>
<p>However, the Xiao family wasn’t weak. Furthermore, they were far away in the South District. The Wang family’s influence couldn’t reach that far yet.</p>
<p>Only the Dugu family, the ruler of the South District, could easily destroy a local wealthy family like the Xiao family.</p>
<p>The Wang family could only placate the Xiao family before slowly plotting in secret to figure out why they wanted Wang Chan.</p>
<p>The matters in the Imperial Capital had basically come to an end. Zhou Wen planned on returning to Luoyang. Before he left, Grandma Wang sent him off with Wang Lu and Wang Chan. She even urged him to visit her often in the future.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen left the Imperial Capital and arrived at an abandoned village. He saw An Sheng sitting on a tree root waiting for him.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, how’s Old Master Xia?” An Sheng had been here for so long. Although he hadn’t entered the Imperial Capital himself, he knew the situation inside the Imperial Capital like the back of his hand. He had already contacted Zhou Wen, but for the sake of safety, he didn’t ask for certain information.</p>
<p>“He won’t appear again in the future.” Zhou Wen recounted what had happened to Xia Jiuhuang, leaving An Sheng shocked.</p>
<p>“Old Master Xia is Xia Jiuhuang. Furthermore, his Invincible Connate Divine Art remains intact. In that case, the Xia family isn’t actually his bloodline?” An Sheng immediately had the same thought as Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Who knows? In theory, if the Invincible Connate Divine Art remains intact, it’s unlikely that Xia Jiuhuang has any descendants. However, his Invincible Connate Divine Art has already fused with the Great Emperor Sutra into the Connate Great Emperor Sutra. Perhaps he can have descendants. Now that he’s dead, I’m afraid no one will ever know this secret,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“How’s Forbidden City now?” An Sheng asked another important question.</p>
<p>“I don’t know either. You have to ask it.” Zhou Wen looked at the listless antelope.</p>
<p>An Sheng clearly knew that it was impossible for him to obtain an answer from the antelope, so he changed the topic. “Li Xuan went to the South District.”</p>
<p>“Why did he suddenly go to the South District?” Zhou Wen was taken aback. Li Xuan had not informed him about this.</p>
<p>“Did Li Mobai get him to go?” Zhou Wen suddenly thought of something as his expression changed drastically.</p>
<p>“No, he went with Worm Dugu. Worm Dugu wanted to take him in as a disciple, but Li Xuan didn’t agree. In order to move Li Xuan, Worm Dugu told him some secrets, so Li Xuan wanted to try his luck in the South District. He was afraid that you would be anxious, so he didn’t let me tell you.” An Sheng recounted the entire matter.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was really worried. Li Xuan might look carefree on the surface, but in fact, he was someone who was easily swayed by emotions. This was Li Xuan’s weakness and his strength. Zhou Wen was really afraid that something would happen to him in the South District.</p>
<p>There were many strange things in the South District. Gu worms, Kuman Thong, black magic, etc. Even if Li Xuan had an indestructible body, it wasn’t absolutely safe in such a place. Furthermore, Li Xuan hadn’t reached the indestructible realm.</p>
<p>It was too late to say anything now. Zhou Wen only hoped that Li Xuan would return safely.</p>
<p>“There’s a rather famous Earth temple ahead. Do you want to take a look?” An Sheng asked Zhou Wen when they arrived at a small town.</p>
<p>“Earth Temple? No harm visiting.” Zhou Wen still remembered that he had obtained a treasure map when he went to the Earth Temple. However, he didn’t manage to dig up any treasure. A baby-like dimensional creature had given him a metal walnut, and inside the metal walnut was Tai Sui.</p>
<p>All the Earth temples in the East District had similar functions. If a native were to pay respects to the Earth Lord, they might obtain a treasure map.</p>
<p>However, if one wasn’t native, Earth Lord would, unfortunately, ignore them even if they cracked their head kowtowing.</p>
<p>An Sheng took Zhou Wen to the nearby Earth temple. The Earth temple here was indeed much bigger than the one Zhou Wen had previously visited. Furthermore, the main god of this temple was land. It didn’t share temples and incense offerings with other gods.</p>
<p>“Treasure maps for sale. They are treasure maps obtained by authentic locals. Just one Legendary Companion Egg.”</p>
<p>“Newly produced treasure maps for only two Legendary Strength Crystals. They just need to be above a 6.”</p>
<p>“An ancestral treasure map…”</p>
<p>It was very lively in front of the Earth temple as though it was a market. Many stalls were selling treasure maps and some were selling crystals and Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t these locals digging for treasures themselves?” Zhou Wen found it odd.</p>
<p>An Sheng said with a smile, “Do you really believe that these people are selling treasure maps? It’s been decades since the dimensional storms. The locals have long finished kowtowing. Only newborn infants have the right to pray to Earth Lord to get a treasure map. How many babies are born every year?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood that these people who sold treasure maps were similar to those who sold antiques and Buddha statues at a temple’s entrance. Most people knew that they were fake, but they still held onto the hope that they could be lucky.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, we aren’t locals. It’s useless even if we kowtow. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be bad to get a treasure map to try our luck,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“That might not be the case. Although we aren’t locals, it’s very likely that Earth Lord will give us a treasure map if he appreciates our good character,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Lad, you sure are optimistic. Instead of having such unrealistic dreams, why don’t you buy two treasure maps from me to try your luck?” an old man selling treasure maps said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Buying a treasure map from you? We might as well kowtow to Earth Lord.” Zhou Wen shook his head and walked towards the Earth temple.</p>
<p>“Lad, take a look again. Perhaps my treasure map is really more useful than Earth Lord’s?” The elder didn’t give up as he held Zhou Wen back.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression changed slightly as he looked at the elder.</p>
<p>His reaction was extremely fast. Even a Mythical creature wouldn’t be able to touch Zhou Wen, much less an elder.</p>
<p>The elder’s seemingly casual tug had grabbed his arm, preventing Zhou Wen from reacting. This was definitely abnormal.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t sense anything special about the elder. His ability to sense danger, which he had honed over time, didn’t work.</p>
<p>The more Zhou Wen looked at the elder, the more he felt as though he had seen him somewhere before. Although his looks were different, his eyes were very familiar.</p>
<p>These eyes… These eyes… Jing Daoxian… There’s no mistake… These are Jing Daoxian’s eyes… Zhou Wen nearly cried out.</p>
<h3 id='chapter771'>Chapter 771: Meeting Jing Daoxian Again</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen seemed to have his hair stand on end as he tried to gather his strength to escape the old man’s grasp. An Sheng also realized that something was amiss as he stared intently at the old man, prepared to attack at any moment.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s surprise, the elder released his hand and picked up a treasure map in the shape of a wooden plaque. He handed it to Zhou Wen and said with a smile, “Lad, this treasure map is on the house. Dig it up and take a look. If you can dig up a treasure, it won’t be too late to buy treasure maps from me.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared at the old man and sized him up, but apart from his eyes, there was nothing about the old man that resembled Jing Daoxian. He couldn’t even sense the Essence Energy fluctuations and exuberant vitality that a cultivator should have. If the old man hadn’t grabbed him, Zhou Wen would have imagined that he was an ordinary person.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to stand on ceremony with an old man like me. Dig it up. Who knows, you might be able to dig up an immortal’s treasure? However, not everyone can take this immortal’s treasure. Without the Lost Immortal art, I’m afraid you won’t be able to return.” The old man stuffed the treasure map into Zhou Wen’s hand.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen heard that, he felt that the old man in front of him was highly likely Jing Daoxian. Otherwise, why would he say the word “Lost Immortal?”</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen?” An Sheng walked to Zhou Wen’s side, but his eyes were still warily staring at the old man squatting behind the stall.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally didn’t want to take the treasure map, but he failed to avoid it. The treasure map was stuffed into his hand as he clenched it. Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy was ready to erupt at any moment.</p>
<p>The old man slowly packed his things and put everything on the stall into a bag. Then, he got up and left. As he walked, he shook his head and sighed. “It’s getting harder and harder to survive in this world.”</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, do you know that old man?” An Sheng couldn’t help but ask when he saw that Zhou Wen was still staring at the old man’s back despite him having walked half a street.</p>
<p>“I suspect that he’s Jing Daoxian,” Zhou Wen whispered.</p>
<p>An Sheng’s body trembled when he heard that. He said in disbelief, “You know Jing Daoxian?”</p>
<p>“I’ve met him once. Although he looked different back then, I think it should be him.” Zhou Wen was somewhat hesitant, unsure if he should chase after him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen really wanted to figure out the Lost Immortal Sutra, but the person in front of him was the most legendary devil in the Federation’s history.</p>
<p>Many devils had appeared in the early stages of the Federation and all sorts of devils had appeared later, such as Ják and company. Although they might have killed more people than Jing Daoxian, none of them were as legendary as Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew very well how terrifying Jing Daoxian was. Lord Alcohol and Xia Jiuhuang were shrewd old men, but they had been toyed by Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>Even though Zhou Wen had impressive achievements, he didn’t dare underestimate such a person.</p>
<p>Previously, Zhou Wen had secretly investigated Jing Daoxian, but the information he obtained was very limited. All he knew was that Jing Daoxian had been severely injured in a dimensional zone and was nearly crippled. Therefore, the bureau had taken the opportunity to pursue him.</p>
<p>Even so, the Special Inspector Bureau’s pursuit failed. They failed to capture the crippled Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had encountered Jing Daoxian during that period of time and obtained the Lost Immortal Sutra.</p>
<p>Gritting his teeth, Zhou Wen got up and chased after him. Although Jing Daoxian was terrifying, avoiding him wasn’t an option. Some things could only be answered by Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>An Sheng chased after Zhou Wen, but when they took the turn which the old man had taken, they realized that there was no sign of the old man. It was as though he had vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept using Truth Listener to monitor the old man, but he failed to discover how he had vanished. It was as though he had teleported.</p>
<p>After searching his surroundings and not finding any traces of the old man, Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he looked at the treasure map in his hand. He saw that the treasure map was a wooden plaque. In front of the wooden plaque was a simple map, and behind it was a time. It was obvious that it had just been written.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, it might really be Jing Daoxian. Young Master Wen, are you going?” An Sheng asked as he looked at the time on the treasure map.</p>
<p>“I have some questions that only Jing Daoxian can answer.” Zhou Wen handed the treasure map to An Sheng. “Help me take a look. Where is the location marked on this map?”</p>
<p>“It’s in front of the Earth temple. Converting the time to local common time, it should be 3:30 in the morning,” An Sheng said after looking at it for a while.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s wait until night,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, find a place to rest first. I’ll make some preparations,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to visit the Earth temple to pay his respects to Earth Lord. He found an inn in town and stayed there, waiting for night to arrive.</p>
<p>An Sheng didn’t return until three in the morning. When he returned, he said to Zhou Wen, “There was too little time. I tried my best to make some preparations. However, if the other party really is Jing Daoxian, my preparations might not be of much use. Young Master, you have to be careful.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded and didn’t say a word.</p>
<p>Seeing that it was about time, Zhou Wen headed to the Earth temple with An Sheng.</p>
<p>The front of the Earth temple was naturally not as lively as in the day. There was no one around, but at the same spot, the elder had his stall set up.</p>
<p>“The surveillance Companion Beasts I set up didn’t work. I didn’t even notice when he entered the Earth temple,” An Sheng whispered to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“It’s fine.” Zhou Wen shook his head slightly before walking towards the elder.</p>
<p>As he walked towards the elder, Zhou Wen also activated the Slaughterer Life Soul. At the same time, he prepared to summon his Companion Beasts. As long as there was anything amiss, he would immediately attack with all his might.</p>
<p>“You came after all,” the elder said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Since you came looking for me, what’s the point of hiding?” Zhou Wen said as he walked towards the elder.</p>
<p>The elder didn’t comment as though he was admiring a treasure. He sized up Zhou Wen and said, “I originally thought that you would be dead. Even if you didn’t die, you should be a lunatic now. However, not only are you not dead or crazy, you seem to be living very well.”</p>
<p>“Because of the Lost Immortal Sutra?” Zhou Wen asked. This was the problem he wanted to figure out. He didn’t know the origins of the Lost Immortal Sutra.</p>
<p>Now, he was basically certain that the elder in front of him was Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>“That’s right.” Jing Daoxian nodded and said, “I found you pleasing to the eye back then. I originally wanted to give you the Skyfiend Treatise that I had researched for fun, but to my surprise, you actually dared reject me. No one in this world can reject me. Even if they do, they will have to pay a price. Therefore, I gave you the Lost Immortal Sutra. In fact, the Lost Immortal Sutra had already changed owners several times before you. Every owner either died or went mad. Even I was tortured by it. If not for this Sutra, I wouldn’t have suffered heavy losses in the dimensional zone.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter772'>Chapter 772: Your Life Belongs to Me</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen had no intention of interrupting Jing Daoxian as he continued listening.</p>
<p>“Back then, I was heavily injured and most of my Companion Beasts had died. I was also affected by the Lost Immortal Sutra’s powers. If this continued, I might have really been driven mad by the Lost Immortal Sutra. I happened to encounter you back then and you left me in a bad mood. Therefore, I used a method to transfer the Lost Immortal Sutra to you. It could eliminate you and reduce my burden. It was killing two birds with one stone.”</p>
<p>With that said, Jing Daoxian stared at Zhou Wen and asked, “I never expected you to master the Lost Immortal Sutra. There have been many owners of the Lost Immortal Sutra, and although they aren’t all peerless elites, they are all outstanding people with their own amazing traits. However, you managed to master the Lost Immortal Sutra despite so many people not being able to. I really want to know how you are better than them and how you are better than me.”</p>
<p>If an ordinary seventeen-year-old student heard Jing Daoxian’s words, they would definitely be delighted.</p>
<p>Even a devil like Jing Daoxian admitted that he was inferior to him. How glorious was that?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen didn’t think so. He had witnessed Lord Alcohol’s death and knew that the reason Xia Jiuhuang was so crazy was because of Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suspected that Jing Daoxian had given him the Lost Immortal Sutra for the same reason.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s anything special about the Lost Immortal Sutra. I mastered it from simply cultivating it,” Zhou Wen answered ambiguously.</p>
<p>This answer clearly wasn’t enough to satisfy Jing Daoxian. He wasn’t in a rush as he said slowly, “Why don’t we make a deal? Answer one question and I’ll answer one. What do you think?”</p>
<p>“I have no questions for you,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Don’t you want to know why the world has become like this? What kind of place is another dimension? How’s your teacher, Wang Mingyuan? Where did the Lost Immortal Sutra come from?” Jing Daoxian offered a few questions that Zhou Wen wanted to know.</p>
<p>“I’ll naturally know the answer to these questions after defeating you.” Zhou Wen suddenly thought of something.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the Lost Immortal Sutra had been deliberately given to him by Jing Daoxian, he could at least confirm one thing—Jing Daoxian wanted to know the process or results of his cultivation.</p>
<p>Just like Lord Alcohol and Xia Jiuhuang, Jing Daoxian might have treated him as an experimental subject.</p>
<p>Since he was an experimental subject, regardless of whether the experiment succeeded or failed, Jing Daoxian probably wouldn’t want him dead before the experiment ended.</p>
<p>Since Jing Daoxian didn’t wish for him to die, why should he have so many qualms? Zhou Wen also wanted to know how much strength the legendary devil still had.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian seemed to see through Zhou Wen’s thoughts as he said indifferently, “Do you think you can be presumptuous in front of me just because I don’t want to kill you?”</p>
<p>“That’s what I think.” Zhou Wen didn’t hide his thoughts.</p>
<p>“Haha, you are right. I really don’t wish to kill you now because you have shown me some interesting possibilities. Compared to killing you, I’m more willing to see the answer.” Unexpectedly, Jing Daoxian had admitted that he wouldn’t kill Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, Jing Daoxian changed the topic and said coldly, “Although I won’t kill you, I can lock you up and slowly study you. It’s best you consider carefully before taking action.”</p>
<p>“I’ve thought it through. Before that, I’ll slice you up,” Zhou Wen said as he drew his saber and slashed.</p>
<p>Transcendent Flying Immortal was unbelievably fast, but this wasn’t Zhou Wen’s trump card. At the same time he attacked, the Great Might Vajra Bull and Behemoth appeared beside him. One used the Soul Suppression Bell, while the other used Absolute Strength.</p>
<p>And this was still Zhou Wen’s form of restrainment. The true trump card was in his pupils. The Torch Dragon’s eye mirror lit up as it prepared to activate the Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>“We will meet again. Remember, your life belongs to me.” Jing Daoxian looked at Zhou Wen with a strange look in his eyes as his figure suddenly burrowed underground. Even the things on the ground burrowed underground with him and instantly vanished.</p>
<p>Earth Escape! Zhou Wen frowned slightly as his saber beam slashed the ground, leaving a deep ravine. However, he didn’t see any signs of Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>Pushing Truth Listener to its limits, he found no sign of Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, perhaps I can track him. During the day, I’ve already scattered some water mixed with a special scent on the ground. The water has evaporated, but the scent remains in the ground. Jing Daoxian has already been stained with this scent. I can try and see if I can track him,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Then quickly give it a try.” Zhou Wen was overjoyed.</p>
<p>He suspected that Jing Daoxian’s injuries hadn’t fully healed. Perhaps now was a chance.</p>
<p>An Sheng summoned a strange little beast. It looked like a rat, but it was much fatter than a rat. It was as fat as a ball and had no eyes. However, there were many fleshy antennae on its nose.</p>
<p>“Ordinary creatures can’t smell the scent. Only Companion Beasts with an extremely developed sense of smell can detect it.” As An Sheng spoke, he got the Companion Beast to leave the Earth temple and search the nearby area, hoping to find the scent Jing Daoxian had left behind.</p>
<p>However, after searching the entire town and its vicinity, he failed to find anything. It was unknown if Jing Daoxian’s Earth Escape was too powerful, allowing him to escape more than fifty kilometers away, or if he hadn’t touched the lingering scent in the ground.</p>
<p>“As expected of the number one devil in the Federation. It’s no wonder he can still be carefree despite being pursued by the Federation for so long. I’ve made so many preparations ahead of time, but none of them worked. Young Master Wen, you have to be especially careful now that you are targeted by such a person,” An Sheng said with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded. “I’ll be careful.”</p>
<p>Not daring to stay in the town any longer, Zhou Wen and An Sheng headed straight for Luoyang. They didn’t stop at all.</p>
<p>However, after that incident, Jing Daoxian didn’t appear again. The journey went very smoothly.</p>
<p>After returning to Luoyang, An Sheng’s tense nerves relaxed a little. “Young Master Wen, it’s best you don’t return to school. I’ll arrange a residence for you. It can block any entry via Earth Escape.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head and said, “It’s impossible for me to hide forever. Besides, Jing Daoxian might not be able to touch me.”</p>
<p>After rejecting An Sheng’s kind intentions, Zhou Wen returned to school. The antelope and chick returned to the building they were used to living in, appearing very comfortable.</p>
<p>With the antelope and chick watching over him, it wouldn’t be easy for Jing Daoxian to secretly take action.</p>
<p>There were no traces of Jing Daoxian three days after his return to campus. Instead, Li Mobai came looking for him again, hoping that Zhou Wen could make a trip to the South District with him to attempt contracting a Guardian.</p>
<p>“Are you sure that the Guardian is still there?” Zhou Wen asked Li Mobai.</p>
<p>This was because he had always suspected that the Guardian Li Mobai mentioned was Xia Liuchuan’s black jade Guardian.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter773'>Chapter 773: Flower River</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Why do you ask?” Li Mobai was an intelligent person. Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s question, he immediately had some ominous thoughts.</p>
<p>“I heard that Dugu Ge, Zhang Chunqiu, and company discovered a Guardian cocoon somewhere in the South District. Furthermore, they have successfully contracted it,” Zhou Wen said half-truthfully.</p>
<p>Li Mobai heaved a sigh of relief when he heard that. “I’m aware of what you just mentioned. The two aren’t in the same place. Up to now, no one has entered the place I discovered. It’s surrounded by extremely dangerous dimensional zones. The most famous dimensional zone is called the Valley of No Return. Even the Dugu family doesn’t dare enter it. Back then, I only managed to see the cocoon of the Guardian by chance. The chances of others seeing it are extremely low.”</p>
<p>To be honest, Zhou Wen was somewhat tempted. There were too few Guardians, and the two Guardians he could come into contact with were just too powerful. There was not much he could do to them.</p>
<p>If there was time for Zhou Wen to slowly develop, it was only a matter of time before he killed them. However, now that Jing Daoxian had come knocking on his door, Zhou Wen felt the pressure.</p>
<p>Just as Xia Jiuhuang had said, if one didn’t enter the Mythical stage, they were ultimately mortal. As their foundation was too weak, they could easily be considered a weakness when facing a Mythical opponent. It was useless even if they had Mythical Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>“According to the agreement, if you can’t contract a Guardian, the Guardian will belong to me, right?” Zhou Wen said to Li Mobai.</p>
<p>“Of course. Happy cooperation.” Li Mobai smiled and extended his hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his hand and shook Li Mobai’s hand, having reached an agreement. It was useless to write such an agreement in black and white, so there was no need to sign a contract.</p>
<p>“When can you set off?” Li Mobai asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Anytime,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“Pack up your things. We’ll set off tonight. After we reach the South District, we need to make a trip to Mong Hsat and find a friend surnamed Gu for help. With him leading the way, we can safely reach the Valley of No Return,” Li Mobai said.</p>
<p>“Is there any trouble we can’t resolve on the way?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>Li Mobai said, “The South District is very different from the other districts. The other districts mostly respect the big and strong. However, in the South District, there are many miniature and evil dimensional creatures. There are even some places where the small are king. The smaller a dimensional creature is, the greater the destructive power it can cause. Just like the Fairy Undying Gu on the rankings. It’s only the size of an ant, but its destructive power isn’t weaker than any dimensional creature on the rankings. In the South District, there are many evil and microscopic dimensional creatures. If one isn’t familiar with the local situation, they might not even know how they died. Although I know a little about it, I’m ultimately not a local. It’s much safer having a local guide.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen nodded and asked, “Do you know that Li Xuan went to the South District?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter where he goes.” Li Mobai left after saying that.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen went back to make preparations and informed his friends that he was heading to the South District.</p>
<p>In the evening, Zhou Wen set off with Li Mobai for Mong Hsat.</p>
<p>Li Mobai brought two others with him. One of them was Butterfly whom Zhou Wen had seen before. The other was a mute. His name was Mute.</p>
<p>The two of them were responsible for Li Mobai’s food and lodging along the way as though they were servants.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still wary of Li Mobai. He had his guard up along the way, but nothing happened.</p>
<p>As flights were no longer possible to Mong Hsat, it wasn’t easy to proceed. After the dimensional storms, the journey had become even more difficult.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Mute, who was very familiar with the jungle path, led the way. Along the way, they climbed mountains and crossed ridges. It was all thanks to him scouting ahead that they were able to avoid most dangers.</p>
<p>Occasionally, they would encounter break-out creatures which were easily dispatched.</p>
<p>Mong Hsat was similar to a lone island on land these days. Too few people could reach this place. Only the nearby natives and people like the Gu family who wanted to develop themselves in Mong Hsat would continue staying here.</p>
<p>On the streets, there were many men and women wearing monk robes. The men’s robes were purple-red, while the women’s were pink.</p>
<p>The locals originally believed in Buddhism. After the dimensional storms, faith became even more important. Be it the indigenous or foreign families, as long as they were people who had settled down in Mong Hsat, they would believe in Buddhism. Otherwise, it would be difficult for them to integrate into the local society.</p>
<p>The friend Li Mobai was looking for was called Gu Shanshui. Although he wasn’t a monk, he was a Buddhist. However, Zhou Wen saw that he was wearing many chains. They didn’t look like something from Mong Hsat. Instead, they looked like the Buddha plaques he had obtained from Xiao Si.</p>
<p>Apart from the Buddha plaques, there were many tattoos on Gu Shanshui’s body. The tattoos were clearly not formed by Companion Beasts, but man-made.</p>
<p>“Li, my friend, I’m afraid there’s no other way to go to the Valley of No Return,” said Gu Shanshui.</p>
<p>“Master Gu, what happened?” Li Mobai knew that something must have happened. Otherwise, with Gu Shanshui’s personality, as long as he agreed, no matter how dangerous the journey to the Valley of No Return was, he would still make the trip.</p>
<p>“There’s only one way to go to the Valley of No Return—Flower River. However, there’s a large-scale break-out there. There have already been many people who wished to travel between Mong Hsat and Chiang Rai using the Flower River. After entering the Flower River, they were not seen again. There’s no lack of Epic experts among them.” Gu Shanshui explained the situation in detail.</p>
<p>The Flower River wasn’t actually a real river. Instead, after the dimensional storms, a type of flower appeared in a large area between Chiang Rai and Mong Hsat. The flower grew in large numbers, forming an endless river, so it was called Flower River by the locals.</p>
<p>Due to the dimensional zones, the transportation between Mong Hsat and Chiang Rai was basically cut off. Only by walking through the Flower River could one avoid all the dimensional zones.</p>
<p>However, in the past half a month, there had been an anomaly in Flower River. Many people who entered the Flower River vanished. No one dared to enter Flower River again.</p>
<p>Previously, an Epic expert from the Gu family had brought people into the Flower River, but there was no news of them. The people sent by the Gu family to investigate had gone missing, but they failed to find anything.</p>
<p>“Do we have to take the Flower River to go to the Valley of No Return?” Li Mobai asked after some thought.</p>
<p>“There’s a stretch that requires us to use the Flower River. We have to travel at least 25 kilometers in the Flower River,” said Gu Shanshui.</p>
<h3 id='chapter774'>Chapter 774: Jellyfish Fungus</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Mobai looked at each other. If they wanted to go to the Valley of No Return, they had to traverse the Flower River. However, before figuring out the Flower River’s situation, the chances of dying if they entered rashly were too high.</p>
<p>“Master Gu, can you take us to the Flower River’s banks to take a look?” Li Mobai asked.</p>
<p>“No problem, but please forgive me. I can’t take you into the Flower River.” Gu Shanshui made himself clear. Even if they reached the Flower River, he definitely wouldn’t enter.</p>
<p>Li Mobai agreed to only get him to take them to the Flower River’s banks. He wanted to have a look at the Flower River first.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also wanted to take a look at the Flower River’s situation. It hadn’t been easy for him to make this trip, so he wasn’t willing to return empty-handed.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui led them to the Flower River. Along the way, they walked through forest trails. There were no roads at all. Gu Shanshui led two young adults from the Gu family ahead to open up a path while Zhou Wen and Li Mobai followed behind.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been using Truth Listener’s ability to monitor everything nearby. Furthermore, he made Tai Sui use its mimicking ability to transform into the chick.</p>
<p>After Tai Sui transformed, it looked identical to the chick, but it was white. It stood on Zhou Wen’s shoulder just like the chick.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was afraid that the antelope would cause trouble again if it came out. Therefore, he didn’t bring it out this time. He had already contacted An Sheng to get someone to deliver food to it to prevent it from causing trouble in school.</p>
<p>According to Worm Dugu, the chick should have the phoenix bloodline. It had a very good restraining effect on Gu worms. Tai Sui also had a strong restraining effect on microscopic dimensional creatures. This was why Zhou Wen had dared to come to the South District.</p>
<p>“Put on your gas masks.” Gu Shanshui stopped and handed them gas masks.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company put on the gas masks. Gu Shanshui looked at the two birds on Zhou Wen’s shoulder and said, “Put away your Companion Beasts.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen placed them in his backpack instead of unsummoning them. Firstly, the chick wasn’t a Companion Beast which he could unsummon. Secondly, Tai Sui needed to be outside to ensure that Zhou Wen wouldn’t be attacked by microscopic Companion Beasts, so it naturally couldn’t be unsummoned.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui naturally saw this scene, but he didn’t say a word. Instead, the two youths from the Gu family curled their lips as though they viewed Zhou Wen’s actions in contempt, but they didn’t say a word either.</p>
<p>Everyone continued walking forward. Zhou Wen soon realized why Gu Shanshui wanted them to wear gas masks. There were many fungi here, and there were so many floating spores everywhere that it appeared like fog.</p>
<p>These bacteria were originally creatures from Earth. They had mutated due to the dimensional storms. Although they hadn’t reached the level of dimensional creatures, the spores they emitted would cause great damage to the human body if they entered the respiratory tract. The main problem was that it was difficult to treat them when they were inside the body.</p>
<p>Tai Sui naturally wasn’t afraid of these spores. It didn’t have much appetite for them either. Perhaps the energy of these spores was so low that they didn’t catch Tai Sui’s eye.</p>
<p>The chick wasn’t afraid of these spores either. Any foreign microscopic organism that entered its body would be refined by the phoenix flames in its body. Otherwise, the phoenix wouldn’t be the nemesis of Gu.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen got the two of them to stay in his backpack and not come out. As the group walked through the forest, their bodies were quickly covered in a layer of dust. They were actually a large number of spores.</p>
<p>Various fungi could be seen everywhere on the ground and withered trees. Many of the trees here had already withered and turned into a paradise for fungi growth.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the spores here were somewhat different from the parasitic spores in Dragon Gate Grotto. The parasitic spores were independent dimensional creatures, and these spores were only a part of a parent body.</p>
<p>Even so, if an unprepared person entered this area and inhaled large amounts of spores, their lungs and respiratory system would be doomed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen realized that there was a corpse on the ground in front of him. From the looks of it, it wasn’t a local. His corpse had already rotted and there was a strange fungi creature growing on it.</p>
<p>Growing on the corpse was something that looked like an egg-sized jellyfish. It was translucent and colorless. Although the mushroom looked beautiful, it made one’s hair stand on end.</p>
<p>“Don’t move. Gu Lou, go take a look,” Gu Shanshui said to one of the young men.</p>
<p>The young man responded and summoned a palm-sized black scorpion Companion Beast. He made it slowly approach the corpse and crawl to the jellyfish-like mushroom.</p>
<p>Gu Lou got Gu Shanshui’s affirmative node before ordering the black scorpion to stab the jellyfish-like mushroom with its tail.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>After the mushroom was pricked, it exploded like a ball filled with water. However, what exploded wasn’t water, but countless transparent spores.</p>
<p>“Retreat!” Gu Shanshui grabbed Gu Lou and another young man named Gu He and threw them behind him. He took a step forward and spat out flames at the spores.</p>
<p>When the flames encountered the spores, they expanded as though they had encountered gasoline. Most of the spores were immediately destroyed, but a few spores still spread out.</p>
<p>Gu Lou and Gu He also used fire-elemental Companion Beasts to burn the spores that escaped their net.</p>
<p>However, the black scorpion Companion Beast had already been invaded by spores. It ignored Gu Lou’s orders and crawled crazily towards the other jellyfish mushrooms, hoping to prick them.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui spewed out flames, incinerating the corpse along with the scorpion Companion Beast. The jellyfish mushrooms exploded in the flames, along with the spores.</p>
<p>After confirming that none had escaped, Gu Shanshui said to Li Mobai with a heavy expression, “Li, there’s something amiss. That person clearly died from being infected with the spores of fungi dimensional creatures. There must be a parent of the fungi dimensional creatures nearby. Furthermore, its level isn’t low. It’s at least at the Epic stage. This has never been discovered in the past. Are you still going to the Flower River?”</p>
<p>Li Mobai looked at Zhou Wen and asked, “What do you think?”</p>
<p>“Let’s continue.” Zhou Wen had been observing the jellyfish mushrooms and spores on the corpse. These things weren’t much of a threat to him.</p>
<p>Even if Tai Sui didn’t take action, he could deal with them himself. There was naturally no need for him to retreat.</p>
<p>“Master Gu, please continue leading the way. If you feel that you can’t continue, please tell me ahead of time,” Li Mobai said to Gu Shanshui.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Master Gu didn’t say anything else and continued leading Gu Lou and Gu He.</p>
<p>Their most commonly used means available to them was a fire-elemental Companion Beast, but this fire-elemental Companion Beast was very strange. The flames it spewed out were a bluish-white color that had a strong restraining effect on fungi and poisonous insects.</p>
<p>After walking for a distance, Zhou Wen suddenly said, “Wait!” This was because he had already discovered with Truth Listener that there were many corpses ahead. Each corpse was covered in jellyfish mushrooms.</p>
<h3 id='chapter775'>Chapter 775: The Chick Spews Fire</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Zhou Wen, what did you discover?” The people in front stopped and Li Mobai looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“There’s something amiss up ahead,” Zhou Wen said as he pointed ahead.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui looked ahead, but he didn’t seem to notice anything. However, he quickly summoned a Companion Beast. The Companion Beast transformed into a mirror eye that appeared in his left eye, making it look like his left eye was completely occupied by the iris.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui used his left eye to look ahead for a while before saying, “There’s indeed a problem ahead. Stay here and don’t move. I’ll go take a look.”</p>
<p>As Gu Shanshui spoke, he dived forward. Before long, he returned and said to Li Mobai, “Zhou is right. There’s indeed something wrong ahead. There are many corpses with jellyfish fungi growing on them. There are too many of them. We can’t deal with them.”</p>
<p>Butterfly said, “We also have fire-elemental Companion Beasts. We can help you clean them up.”</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui shook his head and said, “You must not use fire-elemental Companion Beasts here. Otherwise, there might be trouble. Although the fire-elemental Companion Beasts we use aren’t of a high level, their fire-elemental attributes are very special. It’s called Corpse fire. It’s a type of Yin fire that is most effective against parasitic fungi on rotting corpses.”</p>
<p>“Master Gu, is there any other way?” Li Mobai asked.</p>
<p>“We can only take a detour. If we take a detour, it will take us an additional 30 to 40 kilometers. Furthermore, we might have to pass through a dimensional zone known as the Spirit Absorption Valley. Our speed won’t be fast. We will have to walk for at least ten hours more than we expected. Furthermore, the Spirit Absorption Valley is somewhat dangerous. If we are unlucky, we might have to retreat again,” said Gu Shanshui after some calculations.</p>
<p>“Is there no other way? Spirit Absorption Valley is too dangerous. Furthermore, we might not be able to reach it.” Li Mobai had heard of the famous Spirit Absorption Valley and didn’t wish to go there.</p>
<p>“If we don’t take a detour, we must get rid of the jellyfish fungi. However, we can only slowly deal with them from the periphery. It will probably take two days to clean up all the jellyfish fungi along the way. Furthermore, we don’t know if there are any more,” Gu Shanshui said.</p>
<p>Li Mobai thought for a moment and said, “Then let’s clean up the jellyfish fungi. It’s better not to go to the Spirit Absorption Valley.”</p>
<p>“I have a fire-elemental pet here. Master Gu, can you help me see if it can be of any help?” Zhou Wen released the chick from his backpack.</p>
<p>After Tai Sui advanced to the Mythical stage, it didn’t seem to have much appetite for ordinary microbes. As for these jellyfish fungi, they were only grown from the spores emitted from the parent fungus’ body and not dimensional creatures’ bodies. Tai Sui was even less interested.</p>
<p>Tai Sui: Mythical (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Clashing Tai Sui</p>
<p>Life Soul: Twelve Tai Sui Gods</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Longevity Seed</p>
<p>Strength: 81</p>
<p>Speed: 81</p>
<p>Constitution: 81</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 81</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Earth Escape</p>
<p>Companion Form: Mimicry</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had tried Tai Sui’s Wheel of Destiny, but he hadn’t discovered any special effects as though it was useless. Tai Sui’s body didn’t undergo any changes, leaving Zhou Wen depressed.</p>
<p>“Didn’t Master Gu say that ordinary fire-elemental creatures can’t be used here? Didn’t you hear him just now?” Gu Lou said unhappily.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hadn’t listened to Gu Shanshui’s words to store the chick and Tai Sui away. From the looks of it, he didn’t trust them. This made Gu Lou have a bad impression of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Now that Zhou Wen had taken out a fire-elemental pet, Gu Lou felt even more irked.</p>
<p>However, Gu Shanshui didn’t share the same thoughts. Zhou Wen had discovered the jellyfish fungi ahead of time, making him feel that this young man wasn’t simple.</p>
<p>Furthermore, people like Li Mobai seemed to respect Zhou Wen, making Gu Shanshui even more afraid of underestimating him.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui stopped Gu Lou and looked at the chick. “Does your pet’s flame belong to the Yin fire type?”</p>
<p>“I’m not too sure about that, but its flames can be released and retracted freely. It should be of some use,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“What’s the point of releasing and retracting freely? Whose Companion Beast’s ability can’t do that? Don’t you have any common sense? There are a lot of spores here. When gathered together, they are like powder. Using ordinary flames can easily trigger a dust explosion. Even without the dust explosion, igniting a large area of spores will trigger a forest fire. It’s very easy to alarm the dimensional creatures in the forest…” said Gu Lou.</p>
<p>“Gu Lou, don’t be rude to guests.” Gu Shanshui frowned.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Gu Shanshui’s words, Gu Lou could only shut up and not say another word. However, from his expression, it was obvious that he wasn’t convinced.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui bowed at Zhou Wen and said, “Zhou, Gu Lou is young and insensible. Please don’t take his rude words to heart. However, what he said is right. Typical flames will indeed cause many problems. If you are confident, you can get your pet to give it a try. If you aren’t confident, let us be in charge of cleaning up. It doesn’t matter if we spend more time.”</p>
<p>“Master Gu, I know a little about the taboos of using flames. Didn’t I just say that my pet can control its flames without triggering an explosion or fire?” Zhou Wen had seen the chick’s flames before, so he naturally knew that it had such an ability.</p>
<p>“Then let’s give it a try. Let it spew out some flames,” said Gu Shanshui.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gestured for the chick to spew out its flames, but the chick’s temper wasn’t as good as Zhou Wen’s. Its intelligence wasn’t inferior to humans. Although it didn’t speak the human language, it could understand them.</p>
<p>Gu Lou’s words displeased it. Just as Zhou Wen gestured, the chick flapped its wings and didn’t spew out any flames for Gu Shanshui to verify. It flew straight to the corpses and spat out a swath of golden flames.</p>
<p>“Not good!” Gu Shanshui, Gu Lou, and Gu He were all shocked.</p>
<p>There were nearly a hundred corpses there. Countless jellyfish fungi of various sizes grew on them. Once they were burned by the flames, large numbers of jellyfish fungi would explode. Even if they didn’t produce dust explosions, large numbers of spores would spread out.</p>
<p>However, what happened next left them stunned.</p>
<p>The chick’s golden flames landed on the corpses, igniting the corpses along with the jellyfish fungi. Strangely, the jellyfish fungi didn’t explode when they were burned. They quickly turned to ashes amidst the golden flames.</p>
<p>Nearly a hundred corpses, along with the jellyfish fungi on them, were instantly reduced to ashes. Nothing was left behind.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the golden flames only burned the corpses and jellyfish fungi. They didn’t affect the nearby creatures at all. Even the other spores in the air weren’t ignited.</p>
<p>Gu Lou and Gu He were stunned. Even the Corpse fire they used didn’t have such a good effect, much less be capable of removing all the jellyfish fungi and corpses so quickly.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui stared at the chick as his expression turned odd. After staring at it for a while, he suddenly turned to Zhou Wen and bowed. “Mr. Zhou, if I’m willing to send you through the Flower River to enter the Valley of No Return, can you do me a favor?”</p>
<p>Gu Lou and Gu He were alarmed. The foreigners didn’t know the bow that Gu Shanshui was giving, but they knew very well that it was a very high-level etiquette. Typically, such a bow would only be used for accomplished monks with great merit.</p>
<h3 id='chapter776'>Chapter 776: Flower of Life</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Li Mobai and company looked at Gu Shanshui in a puzzled manner. They didn’t know why he had suddenly changed his mind and was willing to take the huge risk to help them cross the Flower River.</p>
<p>“I wonder how I can help you, Master Gu?” Zhou Wen didn’t agree easily. Gu Shanshui had clearly noticed something from the chick.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui said, “To be honest, our Gu family is also good at nurturing Gu and taming them. I discovered a Mythical dimensional creature somewhere and wanted to tame it into a Gu, but I failed because it was too powerful. If you are willing to help me, Mr. Zhou, you will definitely be able to subdue it.”</p>
<p>As Gu Shanshui spoke, he glanced at the chick. Clearly, his real goal was to seek the help of the chick.</p>
<p>“If it’s within our abilities, it’s only right for us to help each other. However, we are in a rush to head to the Valley of No Return. I’m afraid…”</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could finish his sentence, Gu Shanshui said, “Mr. Zhou, don’t worry. I’ll help you head to the Valley of No Return first. It won’t be too late for you to help me after we return.”</p>
<p>“Master Gu, I still have to ask what kind of Mythical creature you want to tame. What kind of abilities does it have? What do you want me to do?” Zhou Wen asked seriously.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to go back on an agreement, so he had to ask first.</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou, may I have a word with you in private?” Gu Shanshui clearly didn’t want others to know about the dimensional creature.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Gu Shanshui went to the side before Gu Shanshui said, “The dimensional creature I want to tame is a Corpse Silkworm. It’s in an extreme Yin dimensional zone. It’s extremely dangerous for ordinary people, but Mr. Zhou, you have a Phoenix divine bird. It won’t be difficult for it to subdue the Corpse Silkworm.”</p>
<p>“I can agree to help, but I am only able to do my best when the time comes. I can’t guarantee that it will succeed.” After all, Zhou Wen had never seen the Corpse Silkworm before. He didn’t know how powerful it was, so he was being very conservative.</p>
<p>“That’s good enough.” Gu Shanshui was very open-minded.</p>
<p>After the two of them finished their discussion, they walked back. The few of them set off again. Gu Shanshui led Gu Lou and Gu He to open up the path ahead.</p>
<p>Along the way, they discovered some corpses with jellyfish fungi. Gu Shanshui’s expression turned solemn.</p>
<p>On the way, Gu Lou and Gu He secretly sized up the chick from time to time. Even Li Mobai and company took a few more glances at it. Clearly, they knew that the actions Gu Shanshui had taken had something to do with the chick.</p>
<p>The chick stood on Zhou Wen’s shoulder and looked around smugly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept using Truth Listener to observe his surroundings, hoping to find the parent body of the jellyfish fungi. However, he didn’t find the mother. All he saw were the parasitized corpses.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Tai Sui emerged from his backpack. It flapped its wings and flew towards the foliage nearby.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Li Mobai and company looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. My Companion Beast has been in my backpack for too long. It wants to take a walk,” Zhou Wen said casually.</p>
<p>He didn’t wish to be perfunctory, but even he didn’t know what Tai Sui wanted to do. There was no way to explain it clearly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept using Truth Listener to observe the direction Tai Sui had flown in, but there was nothing there.</p>
<p>Tai Sui flew nearly a kilometer before diving into the ground and disappearing.</p>
<p>Tai Sui knew Earth Escape, so Zhou Wen couldn’t hear where it went. After a while, he saw Tai Sui burrow out of the ground and quickly fly back.</p>
<p>However, its stomach was clearly bulging. Zhou Wen did not know what it had eaten.</p>
<p>Everyone set off again when they saw Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast return.</p>
<p>On the way, although they encountered some corpses, they didn’t find any jellyfish fungi on them. When Zhou Wen saw this, he guessed that Tai Sui had burrowed into the ground and eaten the jellyfish fungi’s parent body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a little regretful. He didn’t even get to see what the parent body looked like before it was eaten by Tai Sui.</p>
<p>Without the interference of the jellyfish fungi, everyone moved much faster. Zhou Wen had gained some knowledge. Many of the strange creatures here were things he had never seen or heard of before.</p>
<p>Thankfully, with Gu Shanshui and company leading the way, they avoided the dimensional zones. Otherwise, if they were to enter a dimensional zone, there was no knowing how many terrifying unknown creatures they would encounter.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw a sea of flowers in the distance. The white petals and red stamens looked like a white river speckled by blood from afar.</p>
<p>“That’s the Flower River,” said Gu Shanshui as he pointed at the winding river-like flowers in the distance.</p>
<p>Everyone’s eyes were already focused on the Flower River. Zhou Wen was also using Truth Listener to search the Flower River, but apart from the flowers, there were no living creatures.</p>
<p>The locals called these flowers the Flower of Life. Wherever the Flower of Life appeared, there was no space for other creatures to live. Even weeds wouldn’t grow there.</p>
<p>In the past, it was very safe for humans to enter the Flower River. As there were no other creatures in there, much less dimensional creatures, the Flower River became an important route that connected nearby cities.</p>
<p>However, since a couple of weeks ago, none of the people who entered the Flower River had come out alive. They had all gone missing, and this route had been severed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully sized up the Flowers of Life. The flowers weren’t big and looked somewhat similar to the peach blossoms. They were beautiful.</p>
<p>“These Flowers of Life don’t look like dimensional creatures,” Li Mobai said as he sized up the distant Flowers of Life.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui nodded and said, “The Flowers of Life existed before the dimensional storms. It’s a type of poisonous flower. After the dimensional storms, the poisonous flower mutated. Furthermore, the numbers increased, forming Flower River. However, for some reason, the mutated Flowers of Life don’t have any poison. Many people have experimented with the Flower of Life. It no longer contains any poison. Even if it’s eaten, it won’t cause any harm to humans. However, it might be different now. Everyone, please wait a moment. I need to do some experiments.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company stopped and waited for Gu Shanshui to carry out the experiments. As no one knew what the danger in Flower River was, they could only start by analyzing the Flowers of Life.</p>
<p>Unlike what Zhou Wen had imagined, Gu Shanshui opened a bamboo tube and released a worm that looked like a silkworm. It was fair and plump. The worm crawled towards the Flower River and first nibbled at the Flower of Life’s leaves and roots before chewing on the flower. It didn’t seem to have any problems.</p>
<p>“This is White Silkworm. It’s very sensitive to poison. If it absorbs poison, its body will show different colors,” Gu Shanshui explained.</p>
<p>“Now that White Silkworm hasn’t changed color, does that mean that the Flower of Life remains non poisonous?” Butterfly asked curiously.</p>
<p>Just as she said that, she suddenly saw the white silkworm straighten its body and fall from the flower. It died, but its body remained white without any changes.</p>
<h3 id='chapter777'>Chapter 777: Entering the Flower River</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Master Gu, what’s the situation now?” Li Mobai asked Gu Shanshui.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui didn’t answer. All he did was summon a butterfly Companion Beast and bring back White Silkworm’s corpse.</p>
<p>Then, Gu Shanshui cut off a portion of White Silkworm’s corpse and fed it to another spider. The spider was fine after eating the silkworm’s corpse.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui picked out a strange Buddha plaque from his various Buddha plaques. It looked like a transparent glass bottle with yellow liquid inside. Inside the liquid was a baby-like figurine.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui opened the glass bottle and poured some yellow liquid on the remaining White Silkworm corpse. When the liquid touched White Silkworm’s corpse, it immediately seeped in.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui held the Buddha plaque and muttered something as he injected his Essence Energy into it.</p>
<p>However, after a while, there was nothing from White Silkworm’s corpse.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui put away his Buddha plaque and looked at the spider that had eaten a portion of the white silkworm’s corpse. He said with a heavy expression, “There’s no poison in White Silkworm’s corpse. It didn’t die from poison. I tried using Spirit Control to condense the remnant spiritual consciousness left in the white silkworm, but I failed.”</p>
<p>When Li Mobai heard this, he understood what Gu Shanshui meant. “In other words, the Flower of Life isn’t poisonous. Did White Silkworm die because it lost its soul?”</p>
<p>“That’s probably the case. However, spiritual consciousness isn’t completely equivalent to a soul,” said Gu Shanshui.</p>
<p>“Can you find out what sucked White Silkworm’s spiritual consciousness?” Li Mobai asked.</p>
<p>“No other creatures have been discovered. The greatest possibility is that the Flowers of Life have sucked away its spiritual consciousness. However, this is only a guess,” Gu Shanshui said.</p>
<p>This made Li Mobai and Zhou Wen’s hearts sink. If the Flowers of Life were really up to no good, it would be very dangerous for them to cross the Flower River. If they weren’t careful, their spiritual consciousness might be sucked away.</p>
<p>“This seems to be similar to the Spirit Absorbing Valley’s Spirit Absorbing Worms. Could they be related?” Li Mobai asked.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure yet. I need to further study it.” Gu Shanshui summoned many avian Companion Beasts and made them fly across the Flower River and into the distance.</p>
<p>The Companion Beasts flew over the Flower River a few times without any problems. This made Zhou Wen and company feel better.</p>
<p>If they could cross the Flower River by flying, it could save them a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>After unsummoning his Companion Beasts, Gu Shanshui got Gu Lou and Gu He to open the bamboo cages on their backs. Inside the bamboo cages was a hive with countless wasps entering and exiting.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sized up the hive curiously. He hadn’t noticed it before, but he never expected Gu Lou and Gu He to be carrying such an item.</p>
<p>The wasps inside were clearly not Companion Beasts, nor could they be considered dimensional creatures. They were likely mutated wasps from Earth.</p>
<p>Driven by Gu Lou and Gu He, the wasps flew out of the hive and into the sky above the Flower River. However, not long after they flew, they fell from the sky as though they were drunk and fell into the flowers.</p>
<p>None of the wasps survived; all of them fell into the flower field.</p>
<p>Everyone’s hearts were covered in a shadow. The Companion Beasts were fine, but the wasps died. It was likely that people would end up like the wasps if they entered.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui did some more experiments. He had many strange things on him that dazzled the eyes.</p>
<p>After Gu Shanshui stopped, Li Mobai asked, “Master Gu, is there a way to cross the Flower River?”</p>
<p>“There’s a way, but we can only prevent our spiritual consciousness from being sucked away. We don’t know if there are other dangers inside,” Gu Shanshui said after some thought.</p>
<p>“We’ve already come this far. There’s no reason to return,” Li Mobai said.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui nodded and took out a few Buddha plaques from his pocket and handed them to Zhou Wen. “Hang these Buddha plaques around your necks. They will naturally protect you from having your spiritual consciousness sucked away. However, there are a few taboos that you need to abide by. Firstly, don’t take them off casually after wearing them. I’ll help you take them off when we are in the clear. Secondly, you need to drip a drop of blood on the Buddha plaque every day. Thirdly, you can’t eat meat. You have to abide by these three rules or you will be in trouble.”</p>
<p>After Li Mobai received the Buddha plaque, he put it around his neck. Then, he pricked his finger and dripped a drop of blood onto it.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the drop of blood instantly seeped into the Buddha plaque.</p>
<p>“What Companion Beast is sealed in this Buddha plaque?” Zhou Wen held the Buddha plaque and asked curiously.</p>
<p>This Buddha plaque was very similar to the one used by Gu Shanshui. It was split into three levels. One layer was transparent crystal, while the second layer was yellow liquid. Right in the middle was a black baby figurine.</p>
<p>“The Buddha plaques that seals Companion Beasts are now called Orthodox Buddha Plaques. I made this myself. What’s sealed inside isn’t a Companion Beast, but a Gu. Although it’s a little odd, as long as you abide by the rules, there won’t be any problems. Remember, you have to abide by the rules. Otherwise, you will be in big trouble,” Gu Shanshui warned them repeatedly.</p>
<p>Li Mobai said, “Master Gu’s family used to rear Gu. Later, the Gu family moved to the vicinity of Chiang Rai and learned the local techniques. They have a deep understanding of Buddha plaques and Kuman Thong. Now that they have formed their own style, there aren’t many people in Chiang Rai who can compare to Master Gu.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed Gu Shanshui’s instructions and fed a drop of blood to the Buddha plaque before hanging it around his neck.</p>
<p>Everyone hung the Buddha plaques around their necks and entered the Flower River under the guidance of Gu Shanshui.</p>
<p>As Gu Shanshui had said, with the Buddha plaques, they didn’t suffer the problem of having their spiritual consciousness absorbed. The group traversed the Flower River and saw nothing but a sea of flowers. Although they looked beautiful, they also exuded a sense of loneliness.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to get Gu Shanshui to help him see what use the Buddha plaques he had obtained from Xiao Si were, but after some thought, he decided against it. This place wasn’t far from Chiang Rai. If the Xiao family knew that Xiao Si’s Buddha plaques had landed in his hands, it would inevitably cause trouble.</p>
<p>The sky gradually darkened as the moon rose into the sky.</p>
<p>Under the moonlight, the Flower River seemed to be covered in a mysterious veil. It looked beautiful and terrifying.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Gu Lou suddenly let out a tragic cry as he fell into the bushes. His eyes turned white as his body convulsed violently. White foam seeped out of his mouth as though he had epilepsy.</p>
<p>Everyone was alarmed. Gu Shanshui reacted the fastest. He grabbed Gu Lou’s mouth and forced it open. Then, he took out a small bottle and poured its contents into Gu Lou’s mouth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that there was medicine in the bottle, but to his surprise, he saw a centipede-like bug crawl out of the bottle and into Gu Lou’s mouth.</p>
<h3 id='chapter778'>Chapter 778: Nether Butterfly</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Gu Lou’s abdomen swelled up as he rolled over and vomited.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that Gu Lou had vomited quite a number of white objects. A careful look made him almost vomit as well. Gu Lou had vomited out maggots that squirmed on the ground.</p>
<p>Gu Lou kept vomiting more and more maggots. The few of them felt their scalps tingle, worried that they would end up like Gu Lou.</p>
<p>After vomiting for a while, Gu Lou spat out the centipede-like worm as well. His swollen abdomen shrank and he looked much better. His face remained ghastly pale.</p>
<p>“Master Gu, what’s wrong with Gu Lou?” Li Mobai asked.</p>
<p>They had paid attention to their surroundings just now and hadn’t discovered any problems. The sudden incident with Gu Lou made them equally uneasy.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. It’s not a problem with the Flowers of Life. He was poisoned by a Gu and I killed it.” Gu Shanshui extended his hand and the centipede-like bug flew into his hand. Something dropped from its claws.</p>
<p>It was a worm the size of a rice grain. Ordinary people couldn’t tell that it was a worm.</p>
<p>“This is a relatively common Rice Gu. Although it’s only at the Legendary stage, it’s easy to mistakenly eat it when mixed with rice grains. After entering the body, it can quickly reproduce and destroy the body from the inside. It’s very difficult for outsiders to understand.”</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui paused for a moment before continuing, “The Rice Gu isn’t fast, and its offensive strength isn’t very strong. It’s very difficult for it to enter the body directly. It would have been mixed into the bamboo rice that Gu Lou brought. It was only after he ate that the Rice Gu invaded his body.”</p>
<p>With that said, Gu Shanshui got Gu Lou and Gu He to check the things they had brought. Indeed, in their bamboo rice, they found some Rice Gu. They also found a Gu that was thinner than a strand of hair in the kettle.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui told them that it was also a Legendary Gu named Bone Drilling Worm. It could easily take a person’s life when it invaded their bodies. It burrowed into bone cavities and reproduced in large numbers. It would gnaw on the bones until all the bones were eaten.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief. The few of them hadn’t eaten the bamboo rice or drank any water. Now, they had even less desire for eating or drinking.</p>
<p>The few of them handed their things to Gu Shanshui for inspection. Thankfully, their food and water were fine.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, someone did this before we set off. Master Gu, do you know who did it?” Li Mobai asked.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui shook his head and said, “Members of our Gu family probably wouldn’t do such a thing because they know that these Gu won’t succeed against me.”</p>
<p>Li Mobai fell into deep thought. If it wasn’t someone from the Gu family, it was possible that it wasn’t targeted at Gu Shanshui and company. There were a myriad of possibilities, making it difficult to guess.</p>
<p>“Master Gu, is there any way to guard against these Gu?” Butterfly asked.</p>
<p>After all, she was a woman. She was extremely disgusted when she saw Gu Lou vomiting maggots. She would rather die than vomit.</p>
<p>“There are countless Gu in the South District. It’s easy to defend against one or a few, but to defend against all of them, one can only rely on one’s experience and judgment. However, if you have a legendary divine item that can restrain all Gu, then no Gu will dare approach you.” As Gu Shanshui spoke, he glanced at the chick on Zhou Wen’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“What kind of divine item is that?” Butterfly asked.</p>
<p>“The most famous one is the Mythical Ice Silkworm Gu. If you have an Ice Silkworm Gu with you, basically no Gu will dare approach you. Even if they dare approach you, they will be discovered by the Ice Silkworm Gu and be directly killed. Most Mythical Gu have similar effects, but that’s provided that you can tame them,” Gu Shanshui said.</p>
<p>“Can’t we just kill it and have it drop a Companion Beast?” Butterfly said.</p>
<p>“It works for some, but not all,” Gu Shanshui said ambiguously.</p>
<p>“Why?” Butterfly was puzzled.</p>
<p>“This is because living Gu have experienced many battles. They have very strong instincts, experience, and a certain level of intelligence. They also have territorial awareness. However, when it comes to Companion Beasts, their intelligence might not necessarily be up to standard. They also don’t have combat experience or territorial awareness. Most of them need their owners to control them in order to unleash their might. They are much weaker when it comes to taking precautions. Furthermore, Mythical Gu might not drop Companion Beasts. The chances of taming them are higher,” said Gu Shanshui.</p>
<p>“Master Gu, do you have a Mythical Gu on you? Let it out for us to broaden our horizons,” Butterfly said.</p>
<p>“If I had one, I wouldn’t need to request Mr. Zhou to help me capture the Corpse Bug. There are many people in the South District who rear Gu, but there are very few who have Mythical Gu. Furthermore, most of them should be in the Dugu family.” Gu Shanshui seemed to be in a good mood as he continued, “If Mr. Zhou can help me catch the Corpse Bug this time, I will have a Mythical Gu. In the future, the Gu family will be considered a top faction in the South District.”</p>
<p>They continued after Gu Shanshui checked everyone’s belongings and didn’t find any more Gu.</p>
<p>The Flower River under the moon was so beautiful that it made one’s heart tremble. A breeze blew and the flowers swayed like ripples in a river.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui sniffed hard and suddenly stopped. He made a gesture for everyone to stop before looking at the distant Flower River.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company stopped and looked in the direction of his gaze. They saw a huge sea of flowers ahead, but they didn’t discover anything.</p>
<p>However, the wind became stronger. Not long after, they saw some lights dancing above the distant Flower River.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Truth Listener was extremely powerful, so he quickly saw what it was.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a light at all, but a crystal-like butterfly. The butterfly’s body was transparent, and there were many patterns on its wings. The patterns emitted an icy-blue cold glow, making it look even more dazzling.</p>
<p>When the icy-blue butterfly flapped its wings, it triggered a strong wind that caused ripples through the Flower River.</p>
<p>“That’s… Nether Butterfly…” When Gu Lou saw that it was a butterfly, his originally pale face drained of whatever color it had.</p>
<p>Gu He wasn’t any better. His expression was ugly.</p>
<p>“No wonder none of the people who entered the Flower River survived. There’s actually a Nether Butterfly here…” Gu Shanshui said with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen didn’t know what the Nether Butterfly was, he could tell from its Essence Energy fluctuations that it was definitely a Mythical dimensional creature.</p>
<p>“The legendary netherworld envoy, the Nether Butterfly that guides souls into the Underworld?” Li Mobai had clearly heard of the Nether Butterfly as he stared at the butterfly and frowned.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui whispered, “In the past, I’ve only heard of people encountering the Nether Butterfly. However, it’s in a mysterious dimensional zone that humans are almost unable to reach. I never expected Flower River to have a Nether Butterfly. We sure are down on our luck.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter779'>Chapter 779: Evolution Again</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The Nether Butterfly flew over. Large numbers of Flowers of Life produced specks of light that gathered on the Nether Butterfly’s body.</p>
<p>Soon, the entire Flower River seemed to become a fluorescent river. Fluorescence was rising from every corner.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company were already retreating, but their bodies underwent the same process as the Flowers of Life. They emitted specks of light, and every bit of light emitted from their bodies weakened their minds. They felt exhausted and wanted to fall to the ground to sleep.</p>
<p>They tried stopping the radiance from flowing from their bodies, but to no avail.</p>
<p>“Quick, let’s go. We can’t stop. If we stop, death awaits us.” Gu Shanshui led the way as he ran through the Flower River. Some of the Buddha plaques on his body shimmered with a strange light, causing him to emit radiance at a much slower pace. However, it only slowed down. He didn’t stop the radiance from emitting.</p>
<p>Bam! Bam!</p>
<p>The Buddha plaques on Zhou Wen and company exploded as yellow liquid splattered out. The baby figurine shattered as it transformed into specks of light that scattered out.</p>
<p>Many of the Buddha plaques on Gu Shanshui’s body exploded as well. Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Overlord Sword and slashed at the Nether Butterfly.</p>
<p>The Nether Butterfly’s flying speed was extremely fast. Even if Zhou Wen could escape, the others definitely couldn’t.</p>
<p>However, when the Golden Sword Aura slashed at the Nether Butterfly, it penetrated its transparent body without causing any damage.</p>
<p>“The Nether Butterfly is a Netherworld creature. It can travel between reality and the Netherworld. Typical Essence Energy attacks are useless against it.” As Li Mobai spoke, he summoned a Companion Beast. The Companion Beast was a white-dressed girl holding up a black paper umbrella, but the white-dressed girl had no facial features. She looked extremely strange.</p>
<p>However, the moment the girl came out, the black paper umbrella opened and blocked Li Mobai’s head. Li Mobai immediately stopped emitting light.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the black paper umbrella was too small. It only allowed shelter for two and was unable to envelop everyone.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, try killing the Nether Butterfly,” Li Mobai said as he ordered the white-dressed girl to float towards Zhou Wen with the black umbrella.</p>
<p>The white-dressed girl floated to Zhou Wen’s side like a ghost and used the black paper umbrella to shelter him, preventing him from emitting any more radiance. Zhou Wen immediately felt much better and no longer felt exhausted.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen held the Golden Overlord Sword and turned to charge at the Nether Butterfly.</p>
<p>“Wait!” Gu Shanshui stopped Zhou Wen and extended his hand. A golden child appeared in front of him. The golden child was somewhat similar to Xiao Si’s Kuman Thong, but it didn’t have such a terrifying evil aura.</p>
<p>“Take my Life Soul and your sword will be capable of touching the Nether Butterfly. You don’t have much time. My Life Soul can only last ten minutes at most.” As Gu Shanshui spoke, the golden child transformed into a golden beam of light that fused into the Golden Overlord Sword. It added a golden image that resembled a baby or Buddha on the Golden Overlord Sword. The golden aura from on the sword also became stronger.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a step forward and activated Transcendent Flying Immortal. The Golden Overlord Sword in his hand slashed out a golden sword beam that instantly appeared in front of the Nether Butterfly.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the white-dressed girl with the black umbrella seemed to stick to Zhou Wen. No matter how fast Zhou Wen was, she stuck close to him and used the black paper umbrella to cover his head.</p>
<p>The Nether Butterfly seemed to sense that something was amiss with this strike. With a flap of its wings, its figure seemed to penetrate the Netherworld and vanished. When it reappeared, it was already on the other side of the Flower River.</p>
<p>The Golden Overlord Sword in Zhou Wen’s hand slashed out sword beams one after another, criss-crossing in the air like golden lightning. However, the Nether Butterfly’s figure flickered as it vanished and appeared elsewhere. Zhou Wen’s sword ultimately failed to hit its body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had the black paper umbrella protecting him, so he was fine. However, Li Mobai and company were already exhausted and had no strength to escape. All of them fell to the ground. Gu Lou and Gu He, who were weaker, were about to fall asleep.</p>
<p>Even so, Li Mobai didn’t unsummon his Companion Beast, nor did Gu Shanshui dispel his Life Soul. He continued augmenting Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Since Zhou Wen couldn’t hit it after repeated attempts, he knew that he probably couldn’t kill the Nether Butterfly with his speed alone. He immediately switched his Essence Energy Art and the Holy Hell King Life Soul appeared. The Eye of the Holy Hell King at his glabella opened as well.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to see if the Eye of the Holy Hell King could allow him to see the Netherworld Butterfly pass through the Underworld, but to his surprise, the moment it opened, the light emitted from the Flowers of Life changed directions. It no longer flew towards the Nether Butterfly and instead surged towards the Eye of the Holy Hell King.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that the light on the Nether Butterfly’s body also scattered and flew towards the Eye of the Holy Hell King.</p>
<p>In just an instant, the Nether Butterfly’s body glowed brightly as ice-blue incantations appeared. The incantations prevented the light from scattering from its body.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>As the wings flapped, a terrifying icy-blue light wave spread out from Zhou Wen like spatial ripples.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s eyes focused as he slashed out with the Golden Overlord Sword in his hand without any hesitation. It transformed into a golden sword beam that slashed apart the ice-blue beam.</p>
<p>The Nether Butterfly escaped into the Netherworld again, but under the Eye of the Holy Hell King, Zhou Wen could see the Nether Butterfly. Unfortunately, he couldn’t touch it.</p>
<p>The moment it left the Netherworld, the Golden Overlord Sword slashed at its body. The indomitable sword beam killed the Nether Butterfly and tore its body into two.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>A dimensional crystal dropped. It resembled a sapphire with the shadow of the Nether Butterfly within. It was an Essence Energy Skill Crystal.</p>
<p>Once the Nether Butterfly died, its body immediately transformed into countless beams of light that surged towards the Eye of the Holy Hell King. At the same time, the light from the Flowers of Life was sucked away by the Eye of the Holy Hell King.</p>
<p>Li Mobai and company only saw the light that filled the sky surge towards Zhou Wen’s glabella from all directions, but they couldn’t see the Eye of the Holy Hell King.</p>
<p>Even the white-dressed girl and the golden child were no exception. Their bodies emitted a glow that surged towards Zhou Wen’s glabella. However, Li Mobai and company no longer emitted any radiance.</p>
<p>Li Mobai and Gu Shanshui hurriedly dispelled the white-dressed girl and the golden child. Only then did they prevent their bodies from leaking radiance.</p>
<p>As a large amount of light was sucked into the Eye of the Holy Hell King, Zhou Wen vaguely felt that the Holy Hell King Life Soul was about to evolve again. He couldn’t help but be delighted.</p>
<p>When Holy Hell King evolved again, it would reach the Perfect Body. It would be Zhou Wen’s second Life Soul to reach the Perfect Body.</p>
<p>The originally beautiful Flowers of Life lost their luster as a large area withered. The originally beautiful Flower River instantly turned into a withered land of death.</p>
<p>When all the light was absorbed by Zhou Wen, the Holy Hell King Life Soul evolved almost simultaneously.</p>
<h3 id='chapter780'>Chapter 780: Supreme Hell King</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The sinflames in the Eye of the Holy Hell King bloomed like a lotus flower. Invisible sinflames surged out like layers of petals that enveloped Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>Others could only see Zhou Wen levitating in mid-air and not the invisible sinflames on his body, but they could sense that his aura was constantly rising.</p>
<p>When his aura reached its peak, Zhou Wen’s body underwent a tremendous change. The Holy Hell King Life Soul completed its final evolution amidst the sinflames.</p>
<p>Instantly, Zhou Wen felt his entire body enter a higher dimension, separating himself from reality.</p>
<p>Reality became extremely filthy in his eyes, like a junkyard. And despite being in such an environment, his body remained untainted.</p>
<p>As the sinflames in the Eye of the Holy Hell King were consumed, the Eye of the Holy Hell King gradually closed and vanished.</p>
<p>“When Buddha closes his eyes, every inch of the world will be separated from purity. All life in the tainted world will be abandoned by Buddha and the final purification will descend.”</p>
<p>Looking at the filthy world, Zhou Wen seemed to gain some insight. Although the Eye of the Holy Hell King was closed, his eyes remained open. He did not completely separate himself from reality. Instead, he allowed himself to return to the world.</p>
<p>The condensation of a Life Soul not only had to do with talent, bloodline, and Essence Energy Art, but it also had to do with a person’s concepts and insights. No two people’s Life Souls were identical. That was because everyone’s thoughts were different. It was impossible to be completely the same.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen had been bent on leaving this filthy world, the Holy Hell King Life Soul would have evolved in the direction of a saint, eventually becoming a Buddha or a god.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t have any thoughts of transcending. He stayed in the filthy world. Therefore, the Holy Hell King Life Soul evolved in another direction.</p>
<p>Li Mobai and company looked at Zhou Wen in the air. They originally felt that Zhou Wen’s body emitted a holy pressure as though he was the reincarnation of a Buddha.</p>
<p>However, in the blink of an eye, Zhou Wen’s entire body turned dim. It was as though a true immortal had been struck down to the mortal world, reducing to a mortal. They could no longer sense the otherworldly aura from him, as though he was an extremely ordinary youth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen landed on the ground and stretched his back. He picked up the Essence Energy Skill Crystal that the Nether Butterfly had dropped and looked at Li Mobai and company. “There’s only one crystal. How do we split it?”</p>
<p>“I’m only here for the Guardian’s cocoon. I don’t want anything else,” Li Mobai said.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui shook his head and said, “I only hope that you can help me catch the Corpse Bug after this matter is resolved. These things are useless to me.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I’ll take it.” Zhou Wen didn’t stand on ceremony as he took the crystal.</p>
<p>Everyone set off again. The Flower River’s Flowers of Life had already withered. The originally beautiful Flower River had turned into a barren land. There were no creatures left, allowing them to advance much faster.</p>
<p>While on the way, Zhou Wen took out his phone to take a look. Indeed, he discovered that the Holy Hell King Life Soul had evolved again, becoming a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>However, to Zhou Wen’s disappointment, the Constitution that corresponded to the Holy Hell King Life Soul remained at 40 points. It didn’t increase to 41 points.</p>
<p>This was the same as the advancement of the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. The Essence Energy attribute it corresponded to didn’t increase to 41 points and remained at 40.</p>
<p>My Life Soul has advanced to a Perfect Body, but my stats haven’t reached 41. How can I advance my stats? Zhou Wen was somewhat vexed.</p>
<p>He had been looking forward to it for so long. His Life Soul had advanced to a Perfect Body, but his stats hadn’t increased. This meant that his chances of advancing to the Mythical stage were still very slim.</p>
<p>However, on second thought, Xia Jiuhuang had used the power of nine Life Providences and Life Souls, as well as absorbing the life essence of more than ten thousand Epic experts. With the help of the lightning, he advanced to the Mythical stage as a human. It didn’t seem reasonable for him to advance to the Mythical stage with just four Perfect Life Souls.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen’s heart suddenly stirred. Xia Jiuhang used nine Life Providences and Life Souls to advance to the Mythical stage. Doesn’t that mean that Life Souls and Life Providences are helpful in advancing to the Mythical stage? I didn’t take the wrong path. Is it simply because a single Life Soul isn’t enough to break through the limitations of the attributes?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought of his Dao Sutra and the First Order of Chaos. They were very similar and had strengthened his Essence Energy.</p>
<p>If I were to advance the Chaos Egg Life Soul, which also augments Essence Energy, to a Perfect Body, would the two Life Souls augment my Essence Energy stat to 41 points? With this in mind, Zhou Wen felt a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>His mood improved significantly as he carefully looked at his newly advanced Perfect Body Life Soul.</p>
<p>Supreme Hell King (Perfect Body): The supreme existence in hell, the final faith of the source of sin.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could sense the stark differences between the Supreme Hell King and Holy Hell King. He no longer had the Eye of the Holy Hell King and he didn’t have the lofty authority like the Holy Hell King.</p>
<p>Now, the Supreme Hell King Life Soul made Zhou Wen feel like he truly belonged to hell. He could enter it with his body, not only establish a connection using the Eye of the Holy Hell King.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen hadn’t tried it to see what would happen if he really used the Supreme Hell King Life Soul to enter Hell.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen planned on finding an opportunity to give it a try in-game. It was best not to give it a try in reality.</p>
<p>Even if he didn’t enter Hell, the Supreme Hell King’s augmentation of his senses wasn’t something that the Holy Hell King could match. When the Supreme Hell King Life Soul augmented him, Zhou Wen’s senses became terrifyingly powerful.</p>
<p>However, there was something wrong with this. Under such sharp senses, no matter what he looked at, he found everything filthy. It was as though he was in a garbage dump. It was unbearable.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t necessary, Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to activate the Supreme Hell King Life Soul.</p>
<p>Before long, the group passed through the Flower River and arrived near the legendary Valley of No Return. The Guardian cocoon that Li Mobai mentioned wasn’t in the Valley of No Return, but they had to pass through it.</p>
<p>In order to master the Evil King Gu Life Soul, Li Mobai had accidentally fallen into a stone cave in the Valley of No Return while he was chasing after a Gu King. He passed through the stone cave and arrived at an underground cave behind the Valley of No Return. That was where he discovered the Guardian cocoon.</p>
<p>Now, Li Mobai led Zhou Wen and company through the underground tunnel again. They circled around the Valley of No Return, which everyone in the South District would turn pale at the mention of, and arrived at an underground cave.</p>
<p>They saw the Guardian cocoon. It was gray in color and emitted an evil aura. It was different from any Guardian Zhou Wen had seen before.</p>
<p>“We can’t go any further. There’s a terrifying Mythical creature guarding it.” Li Mobai pointed to the side of the gray cocoon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company looked over and saw a calabash vine growing there.</p>
<h3 id='chapter781'>Chapter 781: Gu Pool</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The calabash vine was very strange. Its roots and leaves were the color of limestone—the color of rocks. It didn’t look like a living creature, and more like something carved from stone.</p>
<p>Above the calabash vine that was twenty to thirty meters long, there was a total of one calabash. It was also grayish-green in color.</p>
<p>“Is that a plant-type dimensional creature?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Li Mobai shook his head and said, “I’m not sure yet. It looks like a plant, but it might be able to spew out a Gu King from inside the calabash. I can’t be sure if it’s a plant or an animal.”</p>
<p>Li Mobai explained his understanding of the calabash vine in detail so that everyone could be prepared.</p>
<p>Back when Li Mobai accidentally entered this cave when chasing a Gu King, the Gu King had been sucked into the calabash just as he was about to catch up to it.</p>
<p>Li Mobai felt that something was amiss with the calabash vine, so he didn’t rush over. Instead, he used a Companion Beast to make probes. However, just as the Companion Beast rushed over, the Gu King that had entered the calabash crawled out again.</p>
<p>The Gu King was the king of bloodsucking Gu. It was at the Epic stage. If Li Mobai wanted to advance to the Evil King Gu Life Soul, he needed to hunt such a Gu King.</p>
<p>Back then, Li Mobai had the Evil King Gu Life Soul. It could be said that other than Mythical Gu, he was invulnerable to all Gu. It wasn’t difficult to deal with a Bloodsucking Gu King.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, after the Bloodsucking Gu King came out of the calabash, it became extremely ferocious. Its strength underwent a drastic change, as though it had advanced to the Mythical stage, and killed Li Mobai’s Companion Beast easily. If Li Mobai hadn’t fled quickly when he saw that the situation wasn’t looking good, he would have died.</p>
<p>Later, Li Mobai came a few more times, but he returned empty-handed. He was no match for the Bloodsucking Gu King.</p>
<p>Li Mobai suspected that the calabash vine was odd. He wanted to remove it and think of a way to lure the Bloodsucking Gu King away before getting a fire-elemental Companion Beast to burn the calabash vine.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, before the fire-elemental Companion Beast could approach the calabash vine, a Gu King crawled out of the calabash again and killed Li Mobai’s fire-elemental Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Later, Li Mobai tried many methods, but they were all useless. Even when his Evil King Gu Life Soul reached the Perfect Body, he still failed to deal with the calabash vine.</p>
<p>After John used the six-winged seraphim to fight Zhou Wen, Li Mobai carried out a lot of investigations and learned about Guardians. Only then did he realize that the truly precious thing wasn’t the calabash vine, but the gray cocoon it protected.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he didn’t have the ability to deal with the calabash vine. Even though he knew that there was a Guardian there, he couldn’t contract it. All he could do was cooperate with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>After hearing Li Mobai’s explanation, Gu Shanshui was alarmed. “You mean that there’s a Mythical Gu in that calabash, and it’s not just one?”</p>
<p>“That’s what I think.” Li Mobai looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Do you want me to use my Companion Beast to lure out the Gu King inside?”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen nodded and summoned Doctor Darkness to fuse with him in his soul form.</p>
<p>Be it ancient wars or modern battles, intelligence was one of the most important factors. Therefore, when Li Mobai summoned his Companion Beast and charged at the calabash vine, Zhou Wen used Doctor Darkness’s Eyes of Penetration to look at the limestone calabash.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the calabash wasn’t a real stone. Through his Eyes of Penetration, he saw through it and was immediately alarmed.</p>
<p>Inside the calabash, there were more than ten different-looking Gu. Their appearances were strange and they looked creepy.</p>
<p>What was even stranger was that the Gu in the gourd were actually fighting each other.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>When the Companion Beast Li Mobai summoned approached the calabash, a force controlled one of the Gu and spat it out.</p>
<p>The Gu looked like a scorpion, but it had dragonfly-like wings on its back. It had fine teeth in its mouth, making it look terrifying.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast Li Mobai released was an Epic black tiger, but when it flew close to the Gu, the Gu’s tail stabbed into its body and it died instantly.</p>
<p>After killing the target, the Gu was sucked back into the calabash.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen three different Gu Kings from all my experiments. This is one of them,” Li Mobai said.</p>
<p>“Strange.” Gu Shanshui frowned and said, “That Gu looks like a Snake Scorpion Gu, but it has many characteristics that the Snake Scorpion Gu doesn’t have. Furthermore, its strength is much stronger than a Snake Scorpion Gu. It has indeed reached the Mythical stage.”</p>
<p>“This is also what I’m puzzled about. If the Gu only entered the calabash at a later time, there must be some benefits inside that can improve their strength greatly. After the Bloodsucking Gu King entered, its strength increased greatly and its body underwent a huge change,” Li Mobai said.</p>
<p>“I suspect that the calabash is likely a natural Gu Pool,” Gu Shanshui said with a solemn expression.</p>
<p>A so-called Gu Pool was to place many Gu inside and let them fight each other. Finally, the last surviving one would be the strongest Gu. And not only was that Gu the strongest, but it would also absorb the abilities and strengths of other Gu in battle. Its strength far exceeded ordinary Gu.</p>
<p>Although it was only a guess, Zhou Wen could see it clearly. The Gu inside were indeed fighting each other. Furthermore, it looked like several of them had Mythical strength.</p>
<p>Although the other Gu hadn’t reached the Mythical stage, they were considered extremely powerful existences at the Epic stage.</p>
<p>This is practically a super Gu Pool. If the Gu inside fight to the end and produce a Gu King, I wonder how powerful it will be. It will probably be comparable to a top Mythical creature, right? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be tempted. If he could obtain this calabash, it would be excellent for raising Gu.</p>
<p>The only pity was that Zhou Wen didn’t know how to raise Gu. Even if a powerful Gu King really appeared, Zhou Wen could only kill it to see if a Companion Egg dropped.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, what do you think?” Li Mobai asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I think Master Gu is right. That calabash is likely a natural Gu Pool. There might be more than one Mythical Gu inside, but where did these Gu come from?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“There are Gu everywhere in the Valley of No Return. There are many at the Mythical stage. I reckon the Gu from the Valley of No Return crawled here and were sucked in by the calabash,” said Gu Shanshui.</p>
<p>“What’s your plan?” Zhou Wen asked Li Mobai.</p>
<p>“There’s no particular solution. We can only lure out the Gu Kings inside and kill them one by one. We’ll have to rely on your strength,” Li Mobai said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that it would be a waste to lure out all the Gu Kings inside and kill them.</p>
<h3 id='chapter782'>Chapter 782: One Thing Subdues Another</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“From the looks of it, that’s the only way.” Although he found it a pity, Zhou Wen didn’t know how to rear Gu. It was useless even if he kept them.</p>
<p>Li Mobai had a plan. Mute and Butterfly each summoned a Companion Beast. Together with Li Mobai’s own Companion Beast, the three Companion Beasts looked identical. They were three bronze men.</p>
<p>The three bronze men were Epic Companion Beasts. Although they moved slowly, their defenses were extremely strong. Furthermore, they weren’t afraid of the poison that Gu were good at, nor were they afraid of them invading their bodies.</p>
<p>It was impossible to use them to kill Mythical Gu, but using them as bait was an ideal choice.</p>
<p>“Could these be the Bronze Men in the Founding Emperor Tomb?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.</p>
<p>Li Mobai nodded and said, “Yes, they are the Bronze Men in the Founding Emperor Tomb. In order to obtain these three Companion Eggs, I spent a lot of money to buy them from the Zhang family.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t unfamiliar with the Founding Emperor Tomb because it was very famous. He had long wanted to see if there was a tiny palm symbol there, but he hadn’t had the chance to go.</p>
<p>As there were many evil powers in the Founding Emperor Tomb, ordinary people couldn’t enter. Only the Zhang family, who were experts in this area, could enter to hunt dimensional creatures. Therefore, very few Companion Beasts from the Founding Emperor Tomb were produced. Furthermore, they were much more expensive than Companion Eggs at the same level.</p>
<p>However, the Companion Beasts in the Founding Emperor Tomb were indeed unique. For example, a Bronze Man was very resistant against Essence Energy and had a strong body. He wasn’t afraid of various toxins and microorganisms. He was an ideal scout.</p>
<p>However, due to the low production, it wasn’t easy to obtain three Bronze Men. It was obvious that Li Mobai was determined to obtain them.</p>
<p>After the three Bronze Men approached the calabash vine, the Gu inside was indeed spat out. However, the one that came out this time was not the previous one, but a mosquito-like Gu with a carapace protecting its body.</p>
<p>Li Mobai told Zhou Wen that this was the Bloodsucking Gu King he had previously chased. However, the prior Bloodsucking Gu King wasn’t that powerful. Now, with the Bloodsucking Gu King around, it was imperative not to have any injuries.</p>
<p>As long as there was a wound, even if it was a very small wound, the Bloodsucking Gu King would be able to expand the wound, causing blood to spray out until the person died.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Bronze Men didn’t have blood, so the bloodsucking ability of the Bloodsucking Gu King was useless against them. However, the Bloodsucking Gu King didn’t only have bloodsucking abilities.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>The Bloodsucking Gu King flapped its wings and flew quickly. The Bronze Men couldn’t keep up with it and one of them was stabbed in the head by its proboscis.</p>
<p>If it were an ordinary Companion Beast, it would definitely have been severely injured from this strike.</p>
<p>However, the Bronze Man wasn’t afraid. It was just a hole on his head that didn’t affect him at all.</p>
<p>The Bloodsucking Gu King even burrowed into the Bronze Man’s head and came out from the other side. However, it only injured the Bronze Man and wasn’t fatal.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to take action, the chick on his shoulder suddenly flapped its wings and flew over.</p>
<p>The mighty Bloodsucking Gu King was like a mouse seeing a cat when it saw the chick. Its body went limp as though it didn’t even have the strength to resist.</p>
<p>Although the chick was powerful, it was still growing. As for the Bloodsucking Gu King, it was already Mythical. If it fought the chick with all its might, the chick might not be able to gain much of an advantage.</p>
<p>However, in this world, everything had a weakness. The chick’s resistance against Gu was just too strong. The Bloodsucking Gu King’s legs went soft. It didn’t even dare to escape, much less fight.</p>
<p>The chick flew over and pecked at the Bloodsucking Gu King. The Bloodsucking Gu King’s carapace was hard, so the chick needed to peck at it a few times before tearing it open and eating it.</p>
<p>From beginning to end, the Mythical Bloodsucking Gu King didn’t resist too intensely. A Mythical Gu was eaten just like that. Li Mobai and company were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Apart from Gu Shanshui who knew about the chick, everyone else watched in surprise as the chick unleashed its might. Although they knew that it was very powerful when it spewed out the flames to kill the jellyfish fungi, they never expected it to be this powerful.</p>
<p>The Mythical Bloodsucking Gu King didn’t even have the courage to resist. This wasn’t something that could be described as powerful. It was practically a strike on a whole different plane.</p>
<p>After the chick finished eating the Bloodsucking Gu King, it seemed unsatisfied as it flew towards the calabash, wanting to peck open the calabash and eat the Gu inside.</p>
<p>However, after pecking a few times, the calabash remained unharmed. Even the golden flames it spewed out failed to burn the calabash.</p>
<p>The calabash seemed to know how powerful the chick was. No matter how the chick tortured it from the outside, it didn’t dare spit out the Gu inside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen got the chick to return and got Li Mobai and company to release the Bronze Men to entice it, but it was useless. The calabash refused to spit out the Gu inside no matter what.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the Golden Overlord Sword and slashed out a Golden Sword Aura at the calabash. The Golden Sword Aura’s Ever-Victorious and Unstoppable worked, causing a crack to appear on the calabash.</p>
<p>However, the Golden Sword Aura vanished the moment it entered the calabash. The crack automatically healed and quickly disappeared.</p>
<p>“If I had known that inviting you would save me so much trouble, I would have invited you over long ago, even if I had gone bankrupt.” Li Mobai and company walked over.</p>
<p>Although he wasn’t able to chop down the calabash or kill all the Gu inside, the calabash didn’t dare take any abnormal action. Li Mobai had achieved his goal. Ignoring the calabash that had turtled up, he walked towards the gray cocoon of the Guardian.</p>
<p>Seeing how magical the calabash was, Zhou Wen wanted to remove it, but after slashing a few times, all his strikes were absorbed. He failed to slice off the calabash.</p>
<p>With the chick standing by the side like a tiger eyeing its prey, ready to eat the Gu that could come out at any time, the calabash didn’t dare do anything out of the ordinary. It didn’t make any abnormal movements and stood still.</p>
<p>Li Mobai had already walked in front of the Guardian cocoon. Without any hesitation, he cut his finger and let his blood drip onto the cocoon.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at the blood that dripped onto the Guardian cocoon. Even Zhou Wen temporarily stopped attacking the calabash and looked over.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally didn’t wish for Li Mobai to succeed. If Li Mobai succeeded, there would be nothing for him.</p>
<p>Blood slowly flowed down the Guardian’s cocoon, but it left Li Mobai very disappointed. The drop of blood flowed down the Guardian’s cocoon and dripped to the ground, unable to penetrate it.</p>
<p>“Master…” Butterfly wore a look of disappointment. She wanted to console Li Mobai, but she didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>“A single failure isn’t a big deal. If it doesn’t work this time, there will be a next time. Since this path doesn’t work, let’s switch paths. As long as we continue walking, there will always be a path that leads to our destination.” Li Mobai didn’t look too disappointed. He sorted out his emotions and said to Zhou Wen, “Zhou Wen, according to our previous agreement, it’s your turn now. If you don’t succeed, I hope you can give them a chance.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter783'>Chapter 783: Phoenix Might</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Sure.” Zhou Wen nodded in agreement. If he couldn’t kill the Guardian, there was no harm in letting others give it a try.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t immediately take action. He had a nagging feeling that the calabash was a hidden danger.</p>
<p>Now that the chick was suppressing it, the calabash didn’t dare act rashly. However, if he were to fight the Guardian, it would be troublesome if the calabash released the Gu inside.</p>
<p>“Wait a moment. I’ll think of a way to pluck this calabash,” Zhou Wen said to Li Mobai and company.</p>
<p>Butterfly joked, “Just drip some blood on the cocoon. The calabash won’t hinder you. There’s no need to go through so much trouble, right? Are you afraid of not obtaining the Guardian’s recognition?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t answer her as he continued studying the calabash in front of him.</p>
<p>This calabash was indeed something good. It could even control Mythical Gu. Furthermore, it could make them fight each other and evolve through devouring the others.</p>
<p>This was actually very similar to the phone’s Companion Beast fusion function. However, it was a more primitive and crude version. It wasn’t as modern as the phone’s fusion function.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, If I can obtain this calabash, I’ll have an explanation if I take out some strange fusion pets in the future. But how can I obtain it? Does this thing count as a dimensional creature? If I slice off the calabash, will it drop a Companion Egg?</p>
<p>The chick pecked and scratched at the calabash, but it wasn’t effective. Even its golden flames didn’t have much effect on the calabash.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen slashed out a few times with the Golden Overlord Sword. Although he could split the calabash, the space in the calabash seemed to have the characteristic of spatial extension. The sword beam would rush in and gradually dissipate, dealing very little damage. Furthermore, the calabash could rapidly recover.</p>
<p>Since I can’t slice apart the calabash, I’ll eliminate it at its roots. Zhou Wen glanced at the roots of the calabash vine and planned on attacking from there.</p>
<p>The Golden Overlord Sword slashed down with an indestructible sword beam. Before the sword beam could strike the roots of the calabash vine, the calabash suddenly spewed out more than ten Gu.</p>
<p>One strange Gu after another charged at Zhou Wen. Some were as tiny as sesame seeds, while others were as large as ferocious beasts. Furthermore, their abilities were different.</p>
<p>Everyone was given a fright. They never expected the calabash to have so many Gu inside. Gu Shanshui and Li Mobai were reflexively prepared to do battle.</p>
<p>A bird’s cry sounded—it was the chick. The Gu that were charging at Zhou Wen immediately turned limp from fright as they fell from the sky.</p>
<p>Only a few Mythical Gu continued charging at Zhou Wen. However, from their trembling bodies, it was obvious that they were extremely afraid. They had no choice but to rush over because of the calabash’s control.</p>
<p>Seeing that they still dared to charge over, the chick immediately flew into a rage. It flapped its wings and leaped up, rushing over to peck at the Gu.</p>
<p>The chick’s strength wasn’t as strong as the Mythical Gu, but for some reason, the Mythical Gu didn’t dare resist. They were pecked by the chick until bloody, and a small Mythical Gu was swallowed by the chick.</p>
<p>The chick wasn’t afraid of the Gu parasitizing its body. Instantly, it looked mighty, resembling an emperor that was dealing with a group of eunuchs. The eunuchs didn’t dare fight back.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder Worm Dugu said that phoenixes are the nemesis of Gu. After seeing the chick, Gu Shanshui also treated it with reverence. This phoenix’s ability to restrain Gu is just too strong. Zhou Wen originally imagined that there would be a fierce battle, but from the looks of it, the chick could finish off all the Gu without him needing to do anything.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Li Mobai looked at the awe-inspiring chick and seemed to be in thought. It looked like he had guessed the chick’s origins.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder Zhou Wen dared to take the risk to come to the South District. So he has such a divine item on him. Li Mobai was enlightened. He knew that it wasn’t because he had moved Zhou Wen, but because Zhou Wen had the confidence to ensure his safety that he had followed him to the Valley of No Return.</p>
<p>The chick unleashed its might, and in a short while, it swallowed more than ten Gu. Its body clearly swelled up and its stomach became round.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly recalled that the antelope had taken the chick to Mount Laojun’s Golden Peak. The chick had suddenly lost weight after returning.</p>
<p>Back then, Zhou Wen was puzzled as to why the chick had suddenly lost weight. Now that he thought about it, the chick must have benefited from Mount Laojun’s Golden Peak and digested the accumulated energy in its body.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder I felt that the chick had grown significantly after that time. It’s not because of time, but because it received some benefit. Zhou Wen now understood why the phoenix had given the chick to him.</p>
<p>This thing had eaten several Mythical Gu and nearly ten Epic Gu, but it was only as fat as a ball and did not immediately grow up.</p>
<p>If he wanted to raise it to adulthood, he didn’t know how many resources he would have to expend. He guessed that the phoenix couldn’t afford to rear so many baby phoenixes, so it wanted to help the chick choose a good family to live with—a place it could eat and sleep for free. However, for some reason, it had chosen him.</p>
<p>After losing all the Gu, the calabash trembled. However, it was only a calabash after all. It couldn’t escape like an animal-type dimensional creature.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t stand on ceremony as he drew his sword and slashed. With a few strikes, he severed the roots of the calabash vine.</p>
<p>When the roots of the calabash snapped, the calabash vine immediately withered. The grayish-blue leaves also shrank and fell. The color of the calabash also gradually became lighter. The original grayish-blue color gradually turned grayish-white.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen slashed at the grayish-white calabash vine, reducing it to ashes. Only the calabash remained intact.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his hand and sucked the calabash into his hand. He pinched it and realized that the calabash was still as hard as before. It didn’t turn to powder like the vines or leaves.</p>
<p>Although the calabash remained, it didn’t have any vitality left in it. Zhou Wen didn’t know if it could still be used. He decided to put it away.</p>
<p>The chick was so stuffed that it was staggering as it walked. It looked like it would fall to the ground and roll away at any moment.</p>
<p>“Stay away for now. I’m going to attack,” Zhou Wen said to Li Mobai and company.</p>
<p>Guardians were generally very strong. Even if Zhou Wen could kill the Guardian inside, it would definitely result in a huge battle. In order not to implicate them, he made them walk far away to give them a chance of escaping if things went south.</p>
<p>“It’s just a drop of blood. There’s no need to go through so much trouble, right?” Butterfly said.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.” Li Mobai seemed to notice something as he instructed Butterfly and Mute to retreat far away with him.</p>
<p>Although Gu Shanshui didn’t know why Zhou Wen wanted them to retreat, he retreated with Gu Lou and Gu He.</p>
<h3 id='chapter784'>Chapter 784: Assassinating the Guardian</h3>
<p>“Don’t tell me Zhou Wen is thin-skinned and is afraid of being mocked by us if he fails?” Butterfly said as she walked.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid it’s not that simple.” Li Mobai had his speculations, but he didn’t know what Zhou Wen was up to.</p>
<p>From his point of view, Zhou Wen wasn’t going to do something as simple as dripping a drop of blood for a contract. It was very likely that he would use some method to increase the success rate of the contract.</p>
<p>In fact, Li Mobai had previously thought of a similar method, but because he had transferred the Evil King Gu Life Soul to Li Xuan, his physique was much weaker now. He didn’t dare use any of the methods he could have used in the past.</p>
<p>Li Mobai was very interested in what method Zhou Wen wanted to use. He hoped that Zhou Wen would succeed. This way, he could use Zhou Wen’s method as a reference and still have a chance in the future.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen waited until they were far enough away before he moved. However, he didn’t walk towards the Guardian cocoon. He also distanced himself from it.</p>
<p>However, while keeping a distance, he summoned Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Boom! Tyrant Behemoth was more than three meters tall, but its body was heavier than steel. When it landed in the cave, the entire cave trembled.</p>
<p>“That’s… Tyrant Behemoth… Tyrant Behemoth that’s ranked fourth… That’s actually Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast…” Butterfly cried out in surprise when she saw Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Gu Lou and company were also alarmed as their eyes nearly popped out. Tyrant Behemoth’s name was probably known to everyone. Many experts in the Federation had been asking about Tyrant Behemoth’s owner, but they never expected it to be Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Previously, Gu Lou had thought that Zhou Wen was young and frivolous, but now, with his terrifying pets, he was probably not weaker than the top experts of the Dugu family. He indeed had the right to be frivolous.</p>
<p>“What’s he trying to do by summoning Tyrant Behemoth?” Li Mobai looked at Zhou Wen in surprise. He felt that something was amiss. Zhou Wen didn’t seem to be using a trick to contract the Guardian.</p>
<p>Indeed, under everyone’s horrified gazes, Tyrant Behemoth roared and threw a punch at the Guardian cocoon.</p>
<p>“He wants to kill the Guardian, not contract it?” Butterfly’s eyes widened in disbelief. This was beyond her imagination.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth shattered the gray cocoon with a punch, revealing the Guardian inside.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Wen, he had already used the Invisibility Cloak to hide himself. At the same time, he summoned Demonic Neonate and hugged her in his arms, using the Invisibility Cloak to cover her. After all, reality wasn’t a game. Everything would be over if he died. Therefore, Zhou Wen was much more careful than usual.</p>
<p>If he could find a Guardian he could kill in-game, he wouldn’t have taken the risk in reality.</p>
<p>Even in his invisible state, Zhou Wen had no intention of approaching the Guardian. He wanted to figure out what abilities the Guardian had.</p>
<p>The Guardian in the gray cocoon was covered in black carapace. There were ant-like antennas on its head, cicada-like wings on its back, snake-like eyes, and four scorpion-like tails on its back.</p>
<p>This Guardian looked like a humanoid Gu, its body filled with an evil aura.</p>
<p>Just as Tyrant Behemoth’s fist was about to hit the Guardian, the Guardian’s figure suddenly blurred. Tyrant Behemoth’s fist only hit an illusion.</p>
<p>Looking up, he saw the Guardian standing upside down at the top of the cave-like a bat. Its snake-like eyes stared at Tyrant Behemoth. The ten fingers on its hands spread open as thin silk blades crisscrossed like a spiderweb, enveloping Tyrant Behemoth below.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth exerted strength with its legs, tearing the rocks apart. Its body rose into the air as it raised its fist and punched at the spiderweb in the air, hoping to blast the spiderweb and the Guardian to death.</p>
<p>However, when its fist struck the spiderweb-like thin blade, the thin blade was able to withstand the force. It was as though it had punched the air.</p>
<p>As for the silk net blade, it retracted and enveloped Tyrant Behemoth’s body.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth was like a huge fish that had fallen into a fishing net. The more it struggled, the tighter the silk blades wrapped around it. Furthermore, the silk blades had a very strong elasticity. Tyrant Behemoth used its strength in an attempt to break the thin silk blades, but all it could do was expand the net a little. When Tyrant Behemoth relaxed, the thin silk net blades tightened.</p>
<p>The Guardian, who was standing upside down at the top of the cave, flashed and appeared behind Tyrant Behemoth as though it had teleported. Its barbed palm and feet hooked onto Tyrant Behemoth’s back. At the same time, it opened its mouth and stabbed its tongue into Tyrant Behemoth’s neck like a blood-colored arrow.</p>
<p>Roar! Tyrant Behemoth directly activated Absolute Strength, but the powerful force failed to help it tear apart the web blades. Even though it moved the web blades away from its body, it was unable to tear the web apart.</p>
<p>“Guardians are indeed stronger than Mythical creatures. A Mythical Companion Beast like Tyrant Behemoth is basically the peak of Mythical creatures, but it’s still inferior when fighting Guardians… Zhou Wen will probably suffer greatly this time… Master… Let’s quickly retreat…” Butterfly said to Li Mobai.</p>
<p>Li Mobai didn’t answer. He looked around and couldn’t seem to find his target. He frowned and asked, “Where did Zhou Wen go?”</p>
<p>Everyone was taken aback. Their gazes were attracted by Tyrant Behemoth and the Guardian. They were watching the battle and didn’t notice where Zhou Wen had gone.</p>
<p>They looked around, but they didn’t see Zhou Wen. All they saw was a golden and white bird on a stone not far away. They were watching Tyrant Behemoth and the Guardian fight.</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhou Wen was wearing the Invisibility Cloak and had activated the Sigh of the King. Not long after, his strength reached the level of activating Slaughterer. Without any hesitation, he activated the Wheel of Destiny of the Invisibility Cloak and secretly approached the Guardian with Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>The invisibility ability of the Invisibility Cloak was just so useful. The Guardian failed to discover the invisible Zhou Wen. It was lying on Tyrant Behemoth’s back and using its tongue to devour the energy in Tyrant Behemoth’s body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already reached its back, but it still failed to notice him. Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen summoned the Light Concealment Sword and slashed at the Guardian’s neck with Immortal Slaying.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, Demonic Neonate in his arms unsheathed her demon sword and slashed at the Guardian’s neck. The two swords slashed down like scissors. At such a close distance, the Guardian had no time to react.</p>
<p>Li Mobai and company didn’t discover any traces of Zhou Wen, but they suddenly heard a tragic cry. When they turned their heads, they realized that Zhou Wen was floating in the air. The Guardian had been beheaded and its head had fallen to the ground.</p>
<p>Plop!</p>
<p>The Guardian’s headless corpse fell from the sky and collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p>The fine web blade on Tyrant Behemoth’s body vanished as well. Zhou Wen carefully floated in the air and flicked his palm as though he was flicking away the blood.</p>
<p>Butterfly, Gu Lou, and company were already shocked speechless. This was because they couldn’t see the invisible Light Concealment Sword. They imagined that Zhou Wen had cleaved off the Guardian’s head with one palm.</p>
<h3 id='chapter785'>Chapter 785: Valley of No Return</h3>
<p>“Is this person… a devil?” Butterfly looked at Zhou Wen and felt a chill run down her spine.</p>
<p>They had painstakingly come here to sign a contract with the Guardian and obtain greater strength.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Wen, he had chopped off the Guardian’s head with one palm. Although they knew that this person wasn’t an enemy, the difference in strength still left them in despair. They even trembled in body and mind.</p>
<p>Li Mobai didn’t think so. His eyes burned as he stared intently at Zhou Wen as though he had discovered new land.</p>
<p>So this is a possible route? Li Mobai felt as though a ball of fire was burning in his body.</p>
<p>There was no fire in Zhou Wen’s body, but as the Guardian’s body disintegrated and vanished, energy surged into his body, causing Slaughterer Life Soul to automatically switch over. After absorbing the energy, it became stronger.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s disappointment, although Slaughterer became stronger, it didn’t advance to a Perfect Body even after the energy was completely absorbed.</p>
<p>How many Guardians do I have to kill to advance Slaughterer to a Perfect Body? Zhou Wen sighed inwardly.</p>
<p>Li Mobai, Gu Shanshui, and company had already returned. Zhou Wen said, “Sorry for not giving you guys an attempt.”</p>
<p>Li Mobai smiled and said, “It’s fine. It’s not important. If it’s convenient, can you tell me why you killed the Guardian? Why didn’t you sign a contract with him?”</p>
<p>“There’s no need for a contract.” Zhou Wen couldn’t explain too much.</p>
<p>“That’s right. You really don’t need it anymore,” Li Mobai said.</p>
<p>Butterfly, Gu Lou, and company felt that Zhou Wen’s words were too arrogant, but when they recalled the scene of the Guardian’s head falling, they felt powerless at refuting him.</p>
<p>“Since we’re already here, why don’t we take a look at the entrance of the Valley of No Return?” Zhou Wen was still wondering if he could find the tiny palm symbol there. With the Valley of No Return, he would have a place to grind for Gu-type Companion Beasts in the future.</p>
<p>“Alright. With you around, the Valley of No Return shouldn’t be able to do much to us. It’s good to broaden our horizons,” Li Mobai said with a smile.</p>
<p>“I’m just taking a look outside. I don’t plan on entering.” Zhou Wen shook his head.</p>
<p>Although he had the chick that could suppress Gu, the chick hadn’t grown up yet. If there were too many Gu, it wouldn’t be able to deal with all of them. Or perhaps there were Gu that weren’t afraid of the chick. If they were to come to blows, the chick might not be able to defeat a Mythical Gu.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was very surprised that the chick could kill those Mythical Gu. He didn’t know if the chick’s noble phoenix bloodline was working or if it had some special power.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after delivering Immortal Slaying, Zhou Wen’s strength had been drained. His body was still in a weakened state. Although he wasn’t as miserable as when he used the Immortal Slaying skill in the past, his combat strength was now greatly affected. Zhou Wen didn’t wish to take the risk at such a time.</p>
<p>The group left the underground cave and arrived at the periphery of the Valley of No Return.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that the valley was stacked layer by layer. There was a valley in a valley, but he didn’t know how big the space was. However, he had heard from locals like Gu Shanshui most people who entered the Valley of No Return never returned. It was what gave it its name.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t that no one returned alive. There were still exceptions. However, those people didn’t venture deep into the valley. Most of them only circled around the valley entrance before coming out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only wanted to circle around the valley’s entrance to find the tiny palm symbol, but he had no intention of entering.</p>
<p>His luck seemed to be surprisingly good. After circling the valley for a while, he found an extremely inconspicuous palm symbol on a mountain wall.</p>
<p>The tiny palm symbol was covered by dense grass and was covered in moss. If Zhou Wen didn’t have Truth Listener’s ability, he wouldn’t have discovered it.</p>
<p>He took a picture with his mysterious phone and saw it downloading. Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>I’ve gained quite a lot this time. I downloaded the Valley of No Return instance dungeon and killed a Guardian. I even made the chick eat quite a number of Gu. I reckon it should be able to grow a little after digesting them, right? Zhou Wen felt that the trip had been quite useful.</p>
<p>However, Li Mobai had come for nothing. He hadn’t obtained any benefits.</p>
<p>Since Gu Shanshui wanted to go to Chiang Rai to capture the Corpse Bug, Zhou Wen had no choice but to accompany him to Chiang Rai. Li Mobai thought for a moment and said, “Master Gu, if you don’t mind, let’s go take a look.”</p>
<p>“Li, it’s great that you can go with us.” Gu Shanshui happily accepted.</p>
<p>Everyone walked along the Flower River towards Chiang Rai. After walking for two to three hundred kilometers, they saw Flowers of Life that hadn’t withered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen rode the Great Might Vajra Bull at the back of the team and played with his phone. The dungeon in the Valley of No Return had been downloaded, so Zhou Wen went in to familiarize himself with the environment.</p>
<p>The Valley of No Return was actually surrounded by mountains on all sides. Only a sliver of an opening allowed entry.</p>
<p>The mountain walls on both sides were very close, allowing only one person to pass through sideways.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar walked in sideways as Truth Listener’s ability was constantly activated. At the same time, it switched its Essence Energy Art to Small Perfection of Wisdom. With the augmentation of the Eight Perfections Wisdom Life Providence and Hell King Life Soul, Zhou Wen’s senses became extremely sharp. Even without Truth Listener, he could see everything around him clearly.</p>
<p>After walking for a short while, Zhou Wen discovered a problem. There were many tiny holes on the walls on both sides. As they were so tiny, one would imagine that they were simply the stone walls’ textures.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen could tell that it wasn’t the texture of the stone. Instead, it was a series of tiny holes. In those tiny holes, there were extremely tiny worms and insects that would occasionally rear their heads. As they were so small, if an ordinary person wasn’t careful, they would end up having these creatures crawl into their body through their pores.</p>
<p>Since the chick couldn’t be brought in-game, Zhou Wen didn’t have a good way to restrain the bugs. All he could do was summon Tai Sui and see if it could eat the bugs.</p>
<p>Although Tai Sui wasn’t very interested in these bugs, it still devoured them under Zhou Wen’s orders.</p>
<p>A large number of notifications appeared on the game screen. They were all indications of him killing Mortal creatures. Occasionally, there would be a notification about him killing Legendary creatures.</p>
<p>There were very few items that dropped, and what did drop was basically useless. With Tai Sui’s help, Zhou Wen passed through the crack and arrived in the valley.</p>
<p>As this was a valley in a valley, Zhou Wen could see a circular valley that wasn’t too big. Inside was grassland that looked verdant.</p>
<p>However, if one had extraordinary vision, they would discover that there were many green caterpillars in the grassland. They were almost one with the grassland, making it difficult to distinguish them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the Fire Furnace Queen and turned the grassland into a sea of fire. This only served to produce constant notifications of him killing Legendary Green-Haired Gu.</p>
<p>There seem to be quite a number of Gu. It’s a good place to grind. I wonder if there will be groups of Epic Gu inside?</p>
<h3 id='chapter786'>Chapter 786: Ancient Tadpole</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Large swaths of Green-Haired Gu were killed, dropping more than ten Green-Haired Gu Companion Eggs and quite a number of dimensional crystals. The valley became narrow again as he walked further in.</p>
<p>Further in, there was another small valley that was shaped like a horse’s hoof. It was even smaller than the valley ahead.</p>
<p>The valley’s terrain was much lower and the ground was covered in clear water. The water level was very shallow, reaching only Zhou Wen’s calf. He could see the bottom at a glance.</p>
<p>There were many water plants growing, making it look very beautiful. It was like a clean paradise.</p>
<p>However, in Zhou Wen’s eyes, such a beautiful and clean place wasn’t that great. There were many leech-like Gu on the rocks and water plants at the bottom. If he rashly entered, he would probably have his blood drained.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned a Water Snake Companion Beast he had obtained in the past. It was a water-elemental snake he had obtained from the island where Six-Winged Guardian Dragon resided. Its body was condensed from water, so it naturally wasn’t afraid of poison or blood-sucking abilities.</p>
<p>After it entered the water, it directly devoured the leeches. When the leeches entered its body, they were immediately sucked dry, turning into small blobs of dried meat.</p>
<p>‘Killed Legendary Leech Gu…’</p>
<p>Notifications kept popping up on-screen. The water snake swam quickly in the water. Wherever it passed, Leech Gu would be sucked dry.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder so few people can come out alive despite so many people entering the Valley of No Return. Not only are there many dimensional creatures here, but their abilities are also extremely sinister. If one isn’t careful, they will succumb to it. It’s not easy to leave alive. Zhou Wen wasn’t excited about the Leech Gu. He didn’t let the water snake continue killing as he flew through the air and headed for the next valley.</p>
<p>The valley ahead had split roads. One path led to the left, while the other led to the right. Zhou Wen chose the left path and entered the next valley.</p>
<p>This valley was clearly much bigger than the previous valley. The water in the valley from before flowed in from here. He could see a waterfall cascading.</p>
<p>There were still many Leech Gu in the water, but he also saw a type of black tadpole swimming around. Groups of tadpoles could be seen everywhere in the water.</p>
<p>However, these tadpoles were extremely large, so large that one likely needed both hands to lift up a tadpole.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat curious about the kind of Gu the tadpoles were, so he got the water snake to charge at them.</p>
<p>Just like before, the water snake went forward to devour the tadpoles in a bid to suck dry the water in their bodies. However, after the tadpoles were devoured, their bodies immediately exploded, blasting the water snake apart.</p>
<p>The tadpoles didn’t die after the explosion. Instead, they turned into a group of tadpoles that continued swimming in the water.</p>
<p>The water snake’s body was originally condensed from water. After being blasted apart, it quickly condensed again and devoured a large number of tadpoles once more.</p>
<p>The tadpoles exploded again, exploding the water snake’s body once again. At the same time, their numbers increased as their sizes shrank. Yet, there was no sign of death.</p>
<p>After a few repeated attempts, the tadpoles had already become the size of sesame seeds. It looked like they could continue exploding and splitting.</p>
<p>This dimensional creature is rather interesting. It can actually explode and split infinitely. I wonder how small it can go? Zhou Wen got the water snake to continue devouring the tadpoles to see what their limits were.</p>
<p>Finally, he realized that when the tadpoles became the size of a needle hole, their bodies wouldn’t continue splitting apart after the explosion.</p>
<p>They split and self-destruct five times in total. Unfortunately, the power of self-destruction is a little weak. Zhou Wen silently calculated.</p>
<p>‘Killed Legendary creature, Ancient Tadpole.’ A notification appeared in the game.</p>
<p>Although the skill was pretty good, Zhou Wen wasn’t interested because its level was a little low and its self-destruction wasn’t powerful enough.</p>
<p>However, soon, a rather special Ancient Tadpole attracted Zhou Wen’s attention. Among the group of Ancient Tadpoles was a dark-gold tadpole that was clearly different from the others.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen got the water snake to rush over and devour the Ancient Tadpole, but with a boom, a huge wave rose from the water. The water snake’s body was blasted apart, along with the water-elemental core in its body. It died just like that.</p>
<p>This self-destruction is quite powerful! Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised as he looked at the dark-gold tadpole that had split apart in the water. He summoned another Companion Beast.</p>
<p>This was the Epic Electric Eel that Zhou Wen had obtained in the underground Pool City. After the Electric Eel charged over, it spewed out an electric current. The dark-gold tadpole immediately split apart and exploded once again.</p>
<p>The Electric Eel was very fast. It escaped quickly in the water and dodged the explosive force of the dark-gold tadpole. It spat out another electric current at the even smaller dark-gold tadpoles.</p>
<p>Clearly, the dark-gold tadpole was at the Epic stage. Its explosive power was extremely powerful, enough to kill most Epic creatures of the same level.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after Zhou Wen’s experiments, he realized that these dark-gold tadpoles had exploded more times than the Ancient Tadpoles. They could explode a total of seven times.</p>
<p>‘Ding… Killed Dark Gold Ancient Tadpole. Discovered Companion Egg.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that there was a dark-gold Companion Egg in the water. He was delighted as he picked it up and hatched it.</p>
<p>Soon, there was an Ancient Dark Gold tadpole in the Companion Beast column.</p>
<p>Dark Gold Ancient Tadpole: Epic</p>
<p>Life Providence: Split</p>
<p>Life Soul: Combine</p>
<p>Strength: 34</p>
<p>Speed: 31</p>
<p>Constitution: 31</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 36</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Self-detonation</p>
<p>Companion Form: Grenade</p>
<p>This thing is really special! Zhou Wen summoned the Dark Gold Ancient Tadpole in-game and a dark-gold grenade appeared in his hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen threw it out. When the Dark Gold Ancient Tadpole landed in the water, it immediately exploded, splitting into a group of Dark Gold Ancient Tadpole grenades.</p>
<p>As for the tiny dark-gold tadpoles, they continued exploding upon undertaking the pressure.</p>
<p>However, the difference from the Legendary Ancient Tadpoles was that after the Dark Gold Ancient Tadpoles self-destructed, they would automatically gather together as long as they were not suppressed by external forces for a period of time. They would become the big Dark Gold Ancient Tadpole again, and the number of possible splits would return to normal.</p>
<p>Unless it self-destructed seven times, the Ancient Dark Gold Tadpole would slowly recover and not die.</p>
<p>This is good stuff. If many Dark Gold Ancient Tadpoles self-destruct at the same time, the might will be quite impressive. Zhou Wen searched the valley again and realized that there was a Dark Gold Ancient Tadpole in every group of Ancient Tadpoles.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen specifically targeted the Dark Gold Ancient Tadpoles in a bid to have more Companion Eggs drop, but after killing more than ten of them, no Companion Egg dropped. Zhou Wen had already arrived near the waterfall and was about to continue searching when he realized that there was an especially huge Ancient Tadpole in the pool beneath the waterfall.</p>
<h3 id='chapter787'>Chapter 787: Mythical Tadpole</h3>
<p>2</p>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The tadpole was more than a meter long, and its head was dozens of centimeters in diameter. When it wriggled its tail, it stirred the water, creating tiny whirlpools.</p>
<p>Its color was relatively light and wasn’t as black as the Legendary Ancient Tadpoles, nor was it similar to the dark-gold colors of the Dark Gold Epic Ancient Tadpoles. It was a light gray color that leaned towards white.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw it, it had already discovered the Electric Eel. With a flick of its tail, it tore through the waves like a torpedo and rapidly slammed into the Electric Eel.</p>
<p>The Electric Eel launched an electric current attack, but when the electric current struck the huge tadpole, it didn’t cause it to explode.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The giant tadpole slammed into the Electric Eel against the electric current’s surge. Then, Zhou Wen saw a terrifying explosion detonate the ancient tadpoles in the valley.</p>
<p>The explosion of the giant tadpole was already terrifying, and the tiny tadpoles that were produced from the explosion slammed into the other Epic and Legendary tadpoles, causing a chain reaction.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that something was amiss. He condensed a protective Essence Energy Skill to resist the explosion, but the terrifying explosion blasted apart the blood-colored avatar’s protective Essence Energy. The armor was also penetrated as the tadpoles that burrowed into his body exploded again. After a series of explosions, the blood-colored avatar died.</p>
<p>Isn’t this explosion a little too powerful? Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed. The tadpole was clearly a Mythical existence. The explosion caused it to split and explode again, causing all the Ancient Tadpoles in the valley to explode. Unless it was a Mythical creature with extremely powerful defense, it was impossible to withstand the blast.</p>
<p>After respawning, Zhou Wen knew better. He didn’t enter the valley himself and summoned Tyrant Behemoth to charge into the valley where the Mythical tadpole was.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen heard a chain of explosions outside the valley. The explosion sent water splattering everywhere, and the water level in the valley outside rose significantly.</p>
<p>The explosion lasted for quite some time before it finally stopped. Zhou Wen roughly counted that there were nine highly intense explosions. It was likely that the Mythical tadpole had experienced nine splits and explosions.</p>
<p>Notifications of various Ancient Tadpoles’ deaths had already flooded the game screen. The last message was especially eye-catching.</p>
<p>‘Killed Mythical Creature, Ancient Splitting Tadpole. Discovered Companion Egg.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen entered the valley and saw Tyrant Behemoth standing in the water, covered in wounds. He was somewhat astounded.</p>
<p>Despite using Absolute Strength, Tyrant Behemoth had still been injured from the blast. Although it was only slightly injured, the Ancient Splitting Tadpole’s self-destruction power was extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>The Companion Egg had dropped into the water. Apart from the Mythical Companion Egg, there were many dimensional crystals and tiny Companion Eggs scattered everywhere in the water. They were likely left behind by the Legendary and Epic tadpoles.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen picked up the Mythical Companion Egg and chose to hatch it.</p>
<p>Soon, the Mythical Ancient Splitting Tadpole appeared in his pet column. It looked no different from before.</p>
<p>Ancient Splitting Tadpole: Mythical</p>
<p>Life Providence: Split</p>
<p>Life Soul: Combine</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Parasitizing Death</p>
<p>Strength: 81</p>
<p>Speed: 76</p>
<p>Constitution: 77</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 81</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Self-detonation</p>
<p>Companion Form: Grenade</p>
<p>The Ancient Splitting Tadpole’s attributes were already rather terrifying. Two attributes had reached the top 81 points, but he didn’t know what kind of ability Parasitizing Death was.</p>
<p>However, just the nine splits and self-destruct abilities were rather terrifying. To be able to injure Tyrant Behemoth while it had Absolute Strength activated meant extreme potency.</p>
<p>It’s a pity that once the Ancient Splitting Tadpole self-destructs nine times, it will really die. It can’t be used randomly outside the game, but I don’t need to have such qualms in-game.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought of Explosive Fiend Man, who also had the ability to self-destruct. His self-destruction was even more ruthless. He could only self-destruct once before dying. He didn’t even have a second chance.</p>
<p>The Splitting Tadpole could self-destruct at least nine times. As long as it didn’t self-destruct nine times in a row, it wouldn’t really die. Controlling it allowed him to use it in reality.</p>
<p>I wonder if I can fuse Splitting Tadpole with Explosive Fiend Man. If Explosive Fiend Man also has such a splitting ability… Zhou Wen didn’t dare continue thinking.</p>
<p>Just the thought of the Explosive Fiend Man self-destructing, splitting into small Explosive Fiend Men, and then exploding everywhere made his scalp tingle.</p>
<p>Looking at the compatibility between Explosive Fiend Man and Splitting Tadpole, he realized that it was only a pitiful 24%. If it was a fusion, the chances of failure were nearly 80%.</p>
<p>Although they both have similar self-destruction abilities, it looks like the two aren’t the same type. Zhou Wen had no choice but to dismiss the idea of fusion.</p>
<p>He reached a dead-end in the Valley of No Return with no way to go further, so Zhou Wen had no choice but to retreat to the fork and walk towards the valley on the right to see what was inside.</p>
<p>The valley on the right was completely different from the valley on the left. After entering the valley on the right, the temperature suddenly dropped. After taking a few steps, frost and snow appeared on the ground.</p>
<p>The valley on the right was a snow valley. The deeper he went, the thicker the snow became. After taking a few steps, the phone screen suddenly turned black. The blood-colored avatar had died for some reason.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, there’s a problem with the snow. Zhou Wen roughly understood the problem, but to be able to make his Hell King Life Soul fail to discover the problem, the things in the snow had to be extremely extraordinary.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to drip his blood to revive and continue grinding in the Valley of No Return, he suddenly heard Gu Shanshui say, “We’ve reached the end of the Flower River. We’ll reach the periphery of Chiang Rai in another ten kilometers.”</p>
<p>“Before the dimensional storms, this area was situated at the borders of three countries—the famous Golden Triangle. In the past, it was chaotic, and it’s not any better now. Not only are there many dimensional zones, but there are also all sorts of evil Essence Energy Arts. Gu, Kuman Thong, voodoo, witchcraft, Buddhist scriptures, and the other districts’ Essence Energy Arts which can be seen here. It’s messy. Furthermore, there are all sorts of people here. It’s very easy for something to happen. You have to be careful here. It’s best you don’t eat anything randomly or take anything from others.”</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui paused for a moment before continuing, “Chiang Rai is in this area. Now, there are three most famous families in Chiang Rai. The biggest one is the Xiao family. The Xiao family isn’t only proficient in Buddha plaques and Kuman Thong, but they also have deep attainments in Gu and voodoo magic. Rumor has it that they have a Mythical Kuman Thong that’s extremely powerful. Anyone who offends this family ends up in a terrible state.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was puzzled and asked, “Isn’t Kuman Thong a Life Soul?”</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui explained, “Kuman Thong was originally witchcraft that nurtured spirit babies. There were Heaven Babies, Earth Babies, and Man Babies. After the dimensional storms, someone used the method of raising Kuman Thong to obtain a quick Life Soul. They used the Kuman Thong they nurtured as their Life Souls.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter788'>Chapter 788: Unexpected Reunion</h3>
<p>With Gu Shanshui leading the way, they quickly arrived at Chiang Rai.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui found them a place to stay. The place he wanted to go was near Chiang Rai.</p>
<p>Chiang Rai and Mong Hsat were a little different. There were many people like Gu Shanshui who had tattoos and Buddha plaques.</p>
<p>After dinner, Li Mobai, Butterfly, and company went out to stroll around Chiang Rai. Zhou Wen stayed put, having no intention of heading out.</p>
<p>As Chiang Rai’s dimensional zones weren’t in the city, he wouldn’t be able to see them even if he went out.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui came to Zhou Wen’s room and said, “Mr. Zhou, we are going to catch the Corpse Bug tomorrow. There are some things we need to make clear today to prevent any future trouble.”</p>
<p>“Master Gu, please speak.” Zhou Wen let him in.</p>
<p>“The place where I’m going to catch the Corpse Bug is called Dragon Corpse River. Legend has it that a dragon died there, its veracity unknown. However, Dragon Corpse Valley is extremely dangerous. The Gu inside are at least at the Epic stage. Occasionally, there will be Mythical Gu appearing. Even the Dugu family has to be careful when entering Dragon Corpse Valley.”</p>
<p>After pausing for a moment, Gu Shanshui continued, “The Corpse Bug I want to capture is in the most dangerous area of Dragon Corpse River. There are many taboos inside. Furthermore, that Corpse Bug is very special. I suspect that the corpse worm is a Mythical Gu born inside the dragon corpse. When the time comes, even with the help of the phoenix divine bird, I’m afraid it won’t be easy for us to subdue it. You mustn’t be careless.”</p>
<p>Following that, Gu Shanshui took out a self-made map and explained the details to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>There weren’t many people who knew of the existence of the Corpse Bug. Furthermore, it wasn’t an easy task to lure it out. It required some special methods.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui explained his plan and means in detail so that Zhou Wen could help him when the time came.</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou, only the two of us know the secret of the Corpse Bug. You mustn’t leak it out. Otherwise, others will definitely vie for it,” Gu Shanshui exhorted.</p>
<p>“Master Gu, don’t worry. My mouth is sealed,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That’s good. I won’t disturb your rest any further, Mr. Zhou.” Gu Shanshui bade farewell and left.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued grinding as the nine black dragons in the Zhuolu underground sea respawned. Zhou Wen farmed the nine dragons again.</p>
<p>Due to his previous experience, the operation went very smoothly. After killing the black dragon with the Wu dragon pearl, the other eight black dragons immediately became disunited, allowing Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts to slaughter them.</p>
<p>When he was slaughtering the sixth black dragon, Zhou Wen heard a chime as a black Companion Egg dropped.</p>
<p>A Companion Egg! Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he turned invisible and picked it up to check its stats.</p>
<p>Demon Blood True Dragon (Kun): Mythical</p>
<p>Life Providence: Demon Dragon Bloodline (Incomplete)</p>
<p>Life Soul: Kun Dragon (Incomplete)</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Dragon Domain (Incomplete)</p>
<p>Strength: 80</p>
<p>Speed: 80</p>
<p>Constitution: 80</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 80</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Dragon Breath, Demon Dragon Transformation, Demon Dragon True Body, Dragon Wrath</p>
<p>Companion Form: Dragon Scale Armor (Incomplete)</p>
<p>Why are there so many incomplete traits? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but feel greatly disappointed when he saw the Demon Blood True Dragon. Its Life Providence, Life Soul, Wheel of Destiny, and Companion Form were all incomplete. Its stats were only 80.</p>
<p>Could it be that I have to gather all nine black dragons to unleash the power of the Demon Blood True Dragon? Zhou Wen hatched the Demon Blood True Dragon and summoned it in its companion form.</p>
<p>Although the Dragon Scale Armor was incomplete, it covered the blood-colored avatar’s entire body. It was impossible to tell what was missing.</p>
<p>Regardless, I finally have a Mythical armor. Zhou Wen looked at the black Dragon Scale Armor on the blood-colored avatar. It looked like its defense was pretty good.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was sizing up the Dragon Scale Armor, he suddenly heard a familiar voice coming from the nearby corridor.</p>
<p>“Old Worm, are you sure you are up to the task?”</p>
<p>“Of course. This was an accident. The next time I take you there, I’ll definitely be able to capture that Mythical Gu.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know how many times I’ve heard that. Can’t you say something new?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I have my own plans. You should have trust in your master.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say that. You’re not my master yet.”</p>
<p>“It’s only a matter of time.”</p>
<p>“I really wonder if you are from the Dugu family. What’s so hard about capturing a Mythical Gu. If it wasn’t for Mi’er being so beautiful and not looking like a bad person, I would have suspected that you are a cheat.”</p>
<p>Worm Dugu and Li Xuan? Zhou Wen listened carefully and immediately knew who the two people were.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly opened the door and walked out. Indeed, he saw Worm Dugu and Li Xuan talking as they walked, preparing to enter the room.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan,” Zhou Wen hurriedly called out to him.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen? Why are you here?” Li Xuan was surprised and delighted when he saw Zhou Wen. He ran over and wrapped his arm around Zhou Wen’s shoulder. “As expected of my good brother. You came to me because you were worried after hearing that I had come to the South District, right?”</p>
<p>“You aren’t a chick. Why would I be worried? I came here because I had something to do in Chiang Rai. I didn’t know you were here,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Brother, you need to work on your words. They hurt my young heart, do you get it?” Li Xuan held his chest with his hand as he wore a stifled expression of heartache.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored him and continued, “Your brother is here.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen said that, he couldn’t help but be taken aback.</p>
<p>Originally, Li Mobai hadn’t needed to come to Chiang Rai, but he had followed. Zhou Wen wondered if he knew that Li Xuan was there.</p>
<p>However, after some thought, it didn’t seem likely. No one knew where Li Xuan had gone with Worm Dugu.</p>
<p>When Li Xuan heard that Li Mobai had come, the smile on his face vanished as his expression turned solemn.</p>
<p>“What’s he doing here?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen recounted how Li Mobai had invited him to the Valley of No Return to find the Guardian cocoon. When Li Xuan heard that Li Mobai had failed to make a contract, his expression darkened.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, he was still very concerned about Li Mobai transferring his Life Soul to him.</p>
<p>“By the way, there’s something else I need to tell you.” Zhou Wen wanted to tell Li Xuan about Xia Jiuhuang. It was very likely that Li Xuan’s eldest brother was Xia Jiuhuang’s victim.</p>
<p>Now that Xia Jiuhuang was dead, this matter had nothing to do with the Xia family. There was no need for Li Xuan to risk his life against the Xia family.</p>
<p>“Eldest disciple, have you thought it through and specially come to take me as your master?” Worm Dugu walked over and said with a smile as he sized up the chick on Zhou Wen’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“No,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“Ahem, don’t be shy. Li Xuan has already agreed to be my disciple. However, I handle matters in a very clear manner. I took a fancy to you first. You are my eldest disciple. This seniority cannot be messed up,” Worm Dugu said without a change in expression.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled. Worm Dugu, who had wanted to acknowledge him as his master, suddenly changed his attitude and turned hostile.</p>
<p>“Don’t spout nonsense. I didn’t agree to be your disciple. You have to beat me in a bet. Perhaps if you lose the bet, you will have to take me as your master in the future? When that happens, you will have to call Old Zhou Uncle-Master,” Li Xuan said with a twitch of his lips.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<h3 id='chapter789'>Chapter 789: Gu God’s Reincarnation</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Worm Dugu beat him to it and said, “I think Li Xuan’s talent is passable, so I plan on taking him in as a disciple. You should also consider it. It’s not too late to regret being my eldest disciple.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood what was going on. Li Xuan’s Life Soul had fused with Li Mobai’s Evil King Gu, so he had some Gu characteristics.</p>
<p>Worm Dugu must have taken a fancy to this point, so he wanted to take Li Xuan in as his disciple.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan and Zhou Wen were good friends. Worm Dugu was afraid that Li Xuan would find it embarrassing if he knew that he wanted to acknowledge Zhou Wen as his master. Therefore, he refused to acknowledge him any further.</p>
<p>“Cut it out. I wonder who stood in front of Zhou Wen’s dorm back then, claiming to be looking for his master.” Li Xuan curled his lips and said, “Don’t worry. I, Li Xuan, am a man of my word. As long as you can beat me in a bet, I’ll definitely acknowledge you as my master. However, if you lose…”</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s surprise, Li Xuan already knew that Worm Dugu wanted to acknowledge him as his master.</p>
<p>“Stop. It’s impossible for me to lose,” Worm Dugu immediately said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen asked Li Xuan what was going on and Li Xuan explained the situation in detail. Only then did Zhou Wen know why Worm Dugu had persuaded Li Xuan to come to the South District.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen left, Worm Dugu happened to bump into Li Xuan, who was taking something from Zhou Wen’s place. The two sides had a verbal clash. Worm Dugu wanted to use his Gu to deal with Li Xuan, but his Gu didn’t dare approach Li Xuan. This left Worm Dugu alarmed.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>After many tests, Worm Dugu realized that Li Xuan’s Life Soul was the nemesis of Gu.</p>
<p>Raising a phoenix was also to restrain Gu. As for Li Xuan himself, he could restrain all sorts of Gu. With such talent, Worm Dugu was tempted to make Li Xuan his disciple and learn how to rear Gu from him.</p>
<p>Li Xuan obviously wasn’t willing but Worm Dugu didn’t give up. He showed Li Xuan the magical effects of many Gu and even said that he wanted to help Li Xuan capture Mythical Gu.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was truly tempted when he saw the strange and magical abilities of the Gu. However, because Worm Dugu had wanted to take Zhou Wen as his master, Li Xuan wasn’t too willing to be Worm Dugu’s disciple. Therefore, he made a bet with Worm Dugu.</p>
<p>If Worm Dugu could capture the famous Ice Silkworm Gu King, Li Xuan would agree to be his disciple and learn how to rear Gu from him. The Ice Silkworm Gu King would be Worm Dugu’s greeting gift to his disciple.</p>
<p>If Worm Dugu couldn’t capture the Ice Silkworm Gu King, he would have to take Li Xuan as his master and teach him how to rear Gu.</p>
<p>Regardless of the outcome, Li Xuan won’t suffer a loss. For Worm Dugu to be willing to suffer such a huge loss, does he really think highly of Li Xuan, or does he have other motives? Zhou Wen thought to himself, momentarily unsure.</p>
<p>“If not for someone causing trouble, I would have long captured the Ice Silkworm Gu King and taken him in as a disciple,” said Worm Dugu.</p>
<p>Li Xuan curled his lips and said disdainfully, “If someone hadn’t barged in and diverted the attention of the Ice Silkworm Gu King, we would probably have died there. To think you call yourself the number one expert in Gu rearing in the South District. How embarrassing.”</p>
<p>Li Xuan recounted what had happened. Originally, Worm Dugu had taken Li Xuan to capture the Ice Silkworm Gu King with the intention of using Li Xuan’s Life Soul to restrain the Ice Silkworm Gu King. With his abilities, he could capture it in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>However, to their surprise, the Ice Silkworm King Gu wasn’t just one, but two. Just as they were about to succeed in trapping one Ice Silkworm King Gu, another Ice Silkworm King Gu suddenly appeared, catching Worm Dugu off guard. The two of them nearly died there.</p>
<p>Thankfully, at that time, there was a group of people who wanted to capture the Ice Silkworm Gu King as well. They diverted the attention of one of the Ice Silkworm Gu Kings, allowing them to escape.</p>
<p>“Now, that group of people is still setting up a trap to capture the Ice Silkworm Gu Kings. I think they have more tricks up their sleeves than this old man. I reckon they have most likely succeeded,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Bullsh*t. Do you think it’s that easy to capture the Ice Silkworm King Gu? With those few useless bums from the Xiao family, they won’t be able to capture the Ice Silkworm King Gu even if they were given another ten years. It’s more like they will all die there,” Worm Dugu shouted as he jumped.</p>
<p>“The Xiao family? Which Xiao family?” Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he asked Worm Dugu.</p>
<p>“Which Xiao family could it be? Only in a small place like Chiang Rai can the Xiao family stand firm,” Worm Dugu said disdainfully.</p>
<p>“I heard that the Xiao family is very powerful. Not only are they good at nurturing Gu, but they also use black magic and Kuman Thong. The Xiao family also has a Mythical-level Kuman Thong…” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Worm Dugu seemed to view the Xiao family with great contempt. When he heard that, he pulled at his beard and said, “There are many bigwigs who know black magic, Kuman Thong, and Buddha plaques in the South District. The Xiao family doesn’t even rank high. They were able to gain a foothold in Companion Beast not because of their excellent techniques, but because they don’t abide by the rules and are ruthless. Do you know how the Xiao family’s Mythical Companion Beasts came about?”</p>
<p>“How did it come about?” Zhou Wen and Li Xuan looked curiously at Worm Dugu.</p>
<p>“More than twenty years ago, there was a family in Chiang Rai. The couple raised Gu and they were rather famous in the South District. They raised Gu, but they never harmed others with them. Later, the wife got pregnant. Ever since she got pregnant, wild Gu often appeared around her house. Those Gu only guarded outside her house, but not a single Gu entered. It was as if they were guarding something. The closer to the wife’s delivery date, the more Gu appeared around her house. There were even Mythical Gu.”</p>
<p>After taking a deep breath, Worm Dugu continued, “Back then, everyone said that the child the wife was carrying was the reincarnation of the Gu God. That was why she attracted all the Gu to protect her. Although the Gu wouldn’t harm them, they caused a lot of trouble for the neighbors nearby. Therefore, the couple had no choice but to move to a remote place to live. Not long after, someone discovered that the couple had died tragically at home. The wife’s abdomen had been sliced open and the baby was nowhere to be seen.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan felt their blood run cold when they heard that. They heard Worm Dugu continue, “Most people believe that the Gu harmed the couple and took away their child. However, a member of our Dugu family had a good relationship with the couple. According to him, the head of the Xiao family had a good relationship with the couple. When he went to meet the couple, he even met the head of the Xiao family. Furthermore, more than a year after the couple died, the Xiao family produced a powerful Kuman Thong. Furthermore, ever since then, the Xiao family, who originally only knew Kuman Thong and black magic, began to rear Gu. Don’t you think it’s too much of a coincidence?”</p>
<p>“It does sound like a coincidence, but it might not be related. Does your Dugu family have any evidence?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“If there was evidence, we would have wiped out the Xiao family long ago. How could we let them live until now? However, I think that the matter was most likely done by the Xiao family,” said Worm Dugu.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that Worm Dugu’s words made sense. Although he didn’t know much about the Xiao family, he had seen Xiao Si before and knew how ruthless he was. He was definitely capable of such a thing.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. The Xiao family wants Wang Chan. Don’t tell me they want to use her to cultivate Kuman Thong? Zhou Wen hurriedly asked Worm Dugu. “Do you need a baby to refine Kuman Thong? Can older people be refined into Kuman Thong?”</p>
<p>“Typically, children between the ages of 0 and 12 can be used to create Earth Babies and Man Babies. That was the method of the past, but the method now is even crueler.” Worm Dugu didn’t elaborate.</p>
<p>“From 0 to 12 years old?” Zhou Wen thought for a moment. Wang Chan seemed to be around 11 or 12 years old. Furthermore, she had the Goddess of Misfortune Life Providence, making her extraordinary.</p>
<h3 id='chapter790'>Chapter 790: Dragon Corpse River</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“If an eleven- or twelve-year-old child has already condensed a Life Providence and it’s very special, will it be helpful in refining a Kuman Thong?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“I’m not too sure about that. After all, I specialize in nurturing Gu, and I only know the basics regarding Kuman Thong. You should ask a professional,” said Worm Dugu.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen chatted with them for a while before bidding them farewell. He wanted to figure out if Wang Chan’s Life Providence would affect Kuman Thong.</p>
<p>After knocking on the door of Gu Shanshui, Zhou Wen roughly recounted the matter, but he didn’t mention the Xiao family or Wang Chan.</p>
<p>“Apart from Heaven Babies, Earth Babies and Man Babies are actually unorthodox. Typically, fetuses that die early or were aborted are used to make Earth Babies and Man Babies. This way, the resentment will be greater and the spirituality will be stronger. Babies that are born will have weaker spirituality as they grow older. The older they are, the more unsuitable they are as Kuman Thong. Twelve years old is the theoretical limit, but very few people would really use such an old child to make Kuman Thong. Unless the child is very special and possesses a special Life Providence, it can be used to make some special evil Kuman Thong or Kuman Nee…”</p>
<p>After hearing Gu Shanhe’s explanation, Zhou Wen was even more certain that the reason the Xiao family wanted Wang Chan was likely related to the refinement of Kuman Thong.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, this Xiao family really deserves death. Zhou Wen was somewhat furious.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen planned on visiting the Xiao family after returning from the Dragon Corpse River to see if they really had such plans. If they really had such plans, Zhou Wen didn’t mind helping Wang Chan eliminate future troubles. It was also considered returning a favor to Wang Lu.</p>
<p>When Li Mobai returned, Zhou Wen told him that Li Xuan was also here. Li Mobai said indifferently that it had nothing to do with him before returning to his room.</p>
<p>The next morning, Zhou Wen, Gu Shanshui, Li Mobai, and company headed to Dragon Corpse River. As for Li Xuan and Worm Dugu, they had to make some preparations before catching the Ice Silkworm Gu King.</p>
<p>“People without the ability should just stay at home and await death. Why do you have to come out and court death?” Li Mobai said coldly as Zhou Wen and company parted ways with Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Li Xuan didn’t say a word as he left with Worm Dugu.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what to say. All he could do was pretend not to hear as he walked ahead with Gu Shanshui.</p>
<p>The Dragon Corpse River got its name because of a dragon dying in the river.</p>
<p>Before the dimensional storms, this was only a legend. No one had really seen a dragon corpse or dragon bones. However, after the dimensional storms, the Dragon Corpse River became a dimensional zone with many taboos.</p>
<p>For example, after entering the Dragon Corpse River, one absolutely could not touch the water of the Dragon Corpse River. Otherwise, one would become a zombie.</p>
<p>There was also the taboo of not being able to fly over Dragon Corpse River and not being able to drip blood in it. Also, women who were on their period could not enter the Dragon Corpse River.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen and company could only enter the Dragon Corpse River by boat. The boat they were on was purchased by Gu Shanshui from a nearby family. According to Gu Shanshui, the materials on the boat had been specially processed. Gu didn’t like the smell of the wood on the boat and typically wouldn’t approach it.</p>
<p>“Li, the Dragon Corpse River is very dangerous. Are you sure you want to join us?” Before boarding the ship, Gu Shanshui asked Li Mobai again.</p>
<p>“With Zhou Wen around, it won’t be too dangerous. Just treat it as me broadening my horizons,” Li Mobai said with a smile.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui didn’t say anything else and led everyone onto the boat. They left the riverbank and headed upstream of the Dragon Corpse River.</p>
<p>The Dragon Corpse River wasn’t very large, but the moment the ship left the riverbank, it felt extremely wide. Furthermore, there was a thick fog over the surface of the river. If it wasn’t for someone with experience like Gu Shanshui, it would have been very easy to lose one’s way in the fog.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to help Gu Shanshui row the boat, but Gu Shanshui told him that on the Dragon Corpse River, the eyes could be fooled. He needed to sense where the Corpse Bug was, so only he could row the boat himself.</p>
<p>After the boat entered the fog, Gu Shanshui took out a container made of clay. He filled the container with river water before placing the container at the bow. Finally, he took out a Gu that looked like a loach and placed it inside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to game in such a place. He kept his mind focused as Truth Listener constantly scanned his surroundings to prevent any possible danger.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to sense that there were many dimensional creatures swimming in the nearby waters. However, they didn’t approach the wooden boat. It was unknown if it was thanks to the wooden boat or the Gu placed in the clay jar.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>The wooden boat slowly rowed across the dark river. Zhou Wen and company abided by the Dragon Corpse River’s taboos, so there wasn’t any danger.</p>
<p>As the wooden boat slowly sailed, Zhou Wen suddenly felt cold sweat drip down his back. A terrifying palpitation made his heart pound.</p>
<p>With Truth Listener’s ability, Zhou Wen realized that at the bottom of the Dragon Corpse River, there seemed to be a huge shadow staring at them.</p>
<p>Plop… Plop… The Gu in the clay jar suddenly jumped as though it had been startled, making Gu Shanshui’s expression turn solemn.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui grabbed the Gu from the clay container and placed it into the river. The Gu swam desperately into the distance, but before it could swim far, it suddenly vanished, leaving only ripples on the river surface.</p>
<p>When the Gu vanished, Gu Shanshui heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>The wooden boat slowly rowed, but the shadow at the bottom of the river was too huge. After rowing for more than ten minutes, the wooden boat still remained above the shadow, unable to row away from it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s mind was tense. He didn’t dare use Truth Listener to scan the shadow, afraid that he would alarm it. If the wooden boat were to capsize, Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of his safety, but the others on the boat would probably die.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the shadow didn’t move. Ever since it ate the Gu, it had only been watching them from the bottom of the river. After rowing for more than half an hour, the wooden boat finally rowed out of the shadow’s range.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen secretly heaved a sigh of relief when the feeling of being watched vanished. I wonder what’s at the bottom of the river? Could it really be a dragon? However, it feels different from the dragons I’ve seen in the past. Its aura is completely different.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wish to cause trouble in such a place. It was naturally best if he didn’t need to fight.</p>
<p>After rowing for about four or five hours, a small island appeared on the river in front of them. The island was at most the size of a soccer field. On it was a small mountain that was less than a hundred meters tall. It was a typical volcano. In addition, large amounts of thick fog spewed out from the volcanic crater—probably the source of the thick fog over the river.</p>
<p>“There it is. The Corpse Bug is in the volcano. After we reach the mountain, I’ll lure the Corpse Bug out. Mr. Zhou, please follow the plan.” Gu Shanshui steered the wooden boat to the bank and got everyone to the shore.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen already knew of Gu Shanshui’s plan. All he needed to do was wait by the side. After the Corpse Bug was lured out by Gu Shanshui, he would take action.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui got everyone to stay at the foot of the mountain. He only took Gu Lou and Gu He up the mountain. They practically crawled forward. When they arrived at the volcanic crater, they took out some small bottles that they had prepared. Every once in a while, they would pour a bottle of yellow liquid into the volcanic crater.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had heard from Gu Shanshui that the liquid was called Corpse Oil. It was extracted from corpses. Only by using it could one lure the Corpse Bug out of the volcano.</p>
<p>This was something that required extreme patience. After seven to eight hours and pouring more than a hundred bottles of Corpse Oil, there was finally movement inside the volcano.</p>
<h3 id='chapter791'>Chapter 791: Battling the Corpse Bug</h3>
<p>1</p>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen and company heard the splattering sounds coming from the volcanic crater.</p>
<p>After Gu Shanshui and company heard the sound, they slowly retreated from the volcanic crater. As they retreated, they poured Corpse Oil on the ground, forming a thin line.</p>
<p>Soon, the trio retreated and hid behind the rocks with Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>A commotion at the volcanic crater soon happened as a bug crawled out.</p>
<p>“Isn’t this a horned beetle?” Zhou Wen sized up the bug from afar and saw that it looked like a horned beetle. It had a black carapace and a split horn on its head.</p>
<p>The worm crawled out bit by bit and crawled down towards the Corpse Oil, licking it clean.</p>
<p>Seeing the bug slowly climb down, Gu Shanshui’s expression turned solemn. Gu Lou and Gu He also looked very nervous.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui looked at Zhou Wen who nodded slightly. In response, Gu Shanshui took out a metal container. It looked like a furnace and also like a tripod. It was an unknown item.</p>
<p>While the Corpse Bug was still licking the Corpse Oil, Gu Shanshui placed the metal container in a crack in the rocks. Then, he poured in dozens of bottles of Corpse Oil, almost filling the metal container.</p>
<p>The smell of the Corpse Oil immediately attracted the attention of the bug. It spread its translucent wings and flew towards the metal container.</p>
<p>It landed on the edge of the metal container and extended its head to suck the Corpse Oil inside.</p>
<p>The container was a little deep. After the bug finished half of it, it couldn’t reach the Corpse Oil below. All it could do was crawl into the container.</p>
<p>“Now.” Gu Shanshui immediately gestured for Zhou Wen to take action as he ran towards the metal container.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen got the chick to fly over and land on the edge of the container.</p>
<p>When the Corpse Bug saw the chick, it wasn’t as afraid as ordinary Gu. It immediately bared its fangs and brandished its claws to confront the chick. However, it could be seen that it was still somewhat afraid of the chick and didn’t immediately charge out from the inside.</p>
<p>While it was hesitating, Gu Shanshui had already rushed to the metal container. He held the lid in one hand and sprinkled some unknown powder into the container with the other. Then, he covered the container with a click.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui pressed down on the metal container with one hand and wrapped a red rope around it with the other, trying to tie it up.</p>
<p>The metal container suddenly shook violently. Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth and got it to help him hold down the lid.</p>
<p>With Tyrant Behemoth’s help, the metal container immediately stopped shaking. However, there were continuous clangs coming from inside.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui didn’t care much. He wrapped a red rope around the metal container several times.</p>
<p>According to Gu Shanshui’s plan, he had already trapped the Corpse Bug. All he needed to do was bring it back and slowly tame it.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, there was a cracking sound coming from the metal container. Gu Shanshui’s expression changed drastically as he knew that something was amiss. He immediately stopped and threw the metal container out.</p>
<p>The metal container exploded in midair, and the red string snapped inch by inch. The Corpse Bug flew out and bared its fangs and brandished its claws. It opened its mouth and spat out a mouthful of thick fog that swept towards Gu Shanshui.</p>
<p>“Quickly retreat. That’s corpse fog,” Gu Shanshui shouted and quickly retreated. At the same time, he summoned dozens of strange Gu.</p>
<p>After the Gu came out, they tried their best to absorb the corpse fog, but they died after absorbing a little.</p>
<p>The chick let out a strange cry and spat out a mouthful of golden flames. When the golden flames met the corpse fog, the corpse fog immediately burned and was reduced to nothing.</p>
<p>The chick also charged at the Corpse Bug and pecked at it.</p>
<p>However, to everyone’s surprise, the Corpse Bug was even faster than the chick. With a flap of its wings, its horn slammed into the chick, sending it flying. The chick landed on the ground and rolled far away before stopping.</p>
<p>Ever since it was born, the chick had never suffered such a huge loss. It flew up as though it was enraged. It spat out large amounts of golden flames at the Corpse Bug, wanting to burn it to death.</p>
<p>The Corpse Bug seemed to be a little afraid of the golden flames. It didn’t dare touch them as it flapped its wings to dodge the golden flames and flew towards the retreating Gu Shanshui.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the Corpse Bug’s intelligence wasn’t low. It knew the principle of bullying the weak and fearing the strong.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui hurriedly summoned his Gu to face the Corpse Bug, but when his Gu touched the Corpse Bug’s corpse fog, they immediately fell to the ground and died twitching. His efforts were futile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched from the side and realized that the corpse fog spewed out by the Corpse Bug wasn’t a poisonous fog, but a mass of bacteria or viruses.</p>
<p>Once the bacteria and virus entered the Gu’s bodies, even the Gu couldn’t take it and quickly died.</p>
<p>Those bacterial viruses should also be considered Gu, right? This Corpse Bug is basically a parent body of Gu. Just a mouthful of mist from it contains a massive number of Gu. Apart from the chick’s flames that can restrain it, it’s really difficult for others to deal with it. Zhou Wen saw the chick fly over and spew out golden flames that burned the corpse fog away.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t let Tyrant Behemoth charge forward. Although Tyrant Behemoth was very powerful, it was too huge. No one knew what would happen if it inhaled the bacteria in the corpse fog.</p>
<p>Corpse Bug was the first Gu that dared to fight the chick, but it was still very afraid of the chick’s golden flames. It didn’t dare to be touched by the golden flames. It used its speed to constantly change its position, wanting to rush over and bite the chick.</p>
<p>The chick wasn’t as fast as it was, but its flight trajectory was very strange. Zhou Wen watched for a while before his eyes widened. This fellow’s flight trajectory looked like his Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>Damn it. A bird actually learned my Transcendent Flying Immortal movement technique? Zhou Wen was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>The chick used Transcendent Flying Immortal and was actually on par with the Corpse Bug. Its golden flames failed to hit the Corpse Bug, and the Corpse Bug failed to touch it.</p>
<p>“Master Gu, do you have a Plan B?” Zhou Wen asked Gu Shanshui while the Corpse Bug was fighting the chick.</p>
<p>He had many Companion Beasts on him, so it wasn’t impossible for them to kill the Corpse Bug. However, it was meaningless for him to kill it since Gu Shanshui wanted it alive.</p>
<p>“Even the Gu flask made of Pure Essence Gold and the Blood Thread Rope made from Blood Thread Gu can’t trap it. It’s useless even if I have a way to lure it over.” Gu Shanshui shook his head and smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>Upon hearing those words, Zhou Wen recalled something. He took out the calabash and handed it to Gu Shanshui. “Try and see if you can use this to trap the Corpse Bug.”</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui knew the origins of the calabash and was overjoyed when he saw it. However, he couldn’t find any holes despite flipping the calabash around.</p>
<h3 id='chapter792'>Chapter 792: Encountering Danger</h3>

<p>“Inject your Essence Energy into it and it will automatically open a hole. However, it doesn’t seem to have the ability to control Gu. You must think of a way to get the Gu inside,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui gave it a try. Indeed, as long as he injected Essence Energy, a gray fog would appear at the top of the calabash, allowing him to put things through the gray fog.</p>
<p>Holding the calabash, Gu Shanshui gritted his teeth and said, “Then we can only risk it.”</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui summoned his Golden Child Life Soul and got him to rush at the Corpse Bug with the calabash.</p>
<p>When the Corpse Bug saw the Golden Child, it was like a bee seeing honey. It abandoned the chick and rushed towards the Golden Child as if it wanted to devour him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was greatly surprised. He didn’t know that the Golden Child Life Soul was that attractive to the Corpse Bug.</p>
<p>Golden Child could also use Essence Energy. It injected its Essence Energy into the calabash and took the opportunity when the Corpse Bug rushed over to store it inside the calabash.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Golden Child was only an Epic Life Soul. Its speed was much slower than the Corpse Bug. Just as the Corpse Bug’s figure flashed, it circled around the calabash and charged at Golden Child’s head.</p>
<p>“No good!” Gu Shanshui’s expression changed drastically. If his Life Soul was destroyed, it wouldn’t be easy to condense another Life Soul.</p>
<p>In particular, his Golden Child Life Soul was also a type of Kuman Thong. However, his was a Heaven Baby and not an unorthodox Earth Baby or Man Baby. It was very rare.</p>
<p>Just as the Corpse Bug was about to slam into the Golden Child’s head, a bamboo suddenly slammed into the calabash, tipping the calabash’s mouth. It happened to hit the Corpse Bug, causing it to vanish and be stored in the calabash.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his hand and retracted the sheathed Bamboo Blade.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui was overjoyed as he hurriedly got Golden Child to withdraw his Essence Energy. The gray fog on the calabash vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>A faint sound of a collision came from the calabash. It was likely that the worm had slammed into the calabash and wanted to rush out. However, it didn’t seem to show any effects against the calabash.</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou, it’s all thanks to you that I was able to catch the Corpse Bug. I really don’t know how to thank you,” Gu Shanshui said excitedly.</p>
<p>“I’m just fulfilling my previous promise. Master Gu, don’t take it to heart. However, you still have to think of a way to find a container when we return. I still have other uses for this calabash,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I’ll think of a way to resolve it when we get back,” Gu Shanshui said hurriedly.</p>
<p>“Congratulations on fulfilling your wish, Master Gu.” Li Mobai walked over with Butterfly and Mute, congratulating Gu Shanshui on finally catching the Corpse Bug.</p>
<p>“It’s all thanks to you and Mr. Zhou.” Gu Shanshui was very happy, but he wasn’t blinded by his emotions. “Let’s leave Dragon Corpse River now. It’s not safe here.”</p>
<p>Everyone pushed the wooden boat down the river and rowed back the way they came.</p>
<p>Not long after, Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Previously, when they had come, the Gu in the Dragon Corpse River didn’t get too close to the wooden ship. However, when they returned, the nearby Gu slowly approached the wooden boat.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there were more and more of them. If the chick wasn’t on the boat, they would have long charged forward.</p>
<p>“Master Gu, something seems amiss,” Zhou Wen said to Gu Shanshui.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui had also noticed the abnormality. He nodded with a heavy expression and said, “It looks like the Gu in Dragon Corpse River are gathering because of the Corpse Bug. However, they don’t dare approach because of the divine bird. But…”</p>
<p>With that said, Gu Shanshui paused before continuing, “However, there might be a terrifying creature in Dragon Corpse River. If it is affected like these Gu, even the aura of the divine bird might not be able to intimidate it. When that happens, we will be in big trouble.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately thought of the huge shadow at the bottom of the river when they came.</p>
<p>“Is there any other solution?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui shook his head slightly. “Even the calabash and wooden boat can’t block the signal emitted by the Corpse Bug. I’m afraid there’s no good solution.”</p>
<p>After some hesitation, Gu Shanshui said, “If it really doesn’t work, I’ll return the Corpse Bug.”</p>
<p>Gu Lou and Gu He were alarmed as they hurriedly said, “Master Gu, you can’t. You finally caught the Corpse Bug after so much difficulty. This Corpse Bug is too important to you. You shouldn’t let it go so easily. Perhaps Dragon Corpse River doesn’t have that terrifying creature, or perhaps that creature isn’t affected by the Corpse Bug at all…”</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui shook his head and sighed. “I never expected the Corpse Bug to be able to trigger the Gu in Dragon Corpse River. Rearing a Corpse Bug is indeed my wish, but I can’t gamble the lives of so many of us. If we were on land, we could still think of a solution, but now, we are on Dragon Corpse River. There are too many taboos here. Once that creature appears, we will definitely die.”</p>
<p>With that said, Gu Shanshui prepared to open the calabash and release the Corpse Bug.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly said, “Master Gu, even if you release the Corpse Bug now, I’m afraid it won’t be able to quell the agitation of the Gu in Dragon Corpse River. We’ve already captured the Corpse Bug. With its intelligence and personality, do you think it will let us leave Dragon Corpse River safely even if we release it?”</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui said with a bitter smile, “I also know that Gu are the most vengeful, but what else can we do?”</p>
<p>Li Mobai said, “Master Gu, I think Zhou Wen is right. Since Gu bear grudges, it’s impossible to avoid its revenge whether we release it or not. Why don’t we leave it as a hostage… Perhaps there’s a chance of leaving Dragon Corpse River.”</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui gritted his teeth. “Now that things have come to this, I can only take a gamble. I didn’t think things through properly this time, so I made everyone suffer with me. If I don’t die today, I’ll make amends to everyone in the future.”</p>
<p>“We’ll talk about those things in the future. Let’s do some preparatory work first. Even if there are creatures in Dragon Corpse River that even the divine bird can’t stop, we won’t be sitting back and doing nothing,” Li Mobai said.</p>
<p>They discussed things for a while and began making preparations.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the range of their activity was limited to the wooden boat. They couldn’t leave the wooden boat and fly into the sky, nor could they touch the water. They couldn’t even be injured. This was too restrictive for them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and summoned the Primordial Spore. He got it to enter the water to probe the situation. No matter how powerful the Gu in the water were, it was difficult to discover such minute Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>After the Primordial Spore entered the water, it followed Zhou Wen’s instructions and dived forward.</p>
<p>Everyone did everything they could to ensure that the wooden boat continued forward. More and more Gu gathered in the surrounding waters, and they were getting closer and closer to the wooden boat. They could see the churning water in the distance with their naked eyes. There were all sorts of Gu around them, squeezed together. It was strange and nauseating.</p>
<p>And under Zhou Wen’s observation, there was a huge shadow at the bottom of the river approaching the wooden boat.</p>
<h3 id='chapter793'>Chapter 793: Dragon King Gu</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Gu Shanshui’s fears came to live. The huge shadow slowly rose from the bottom of the river.</p>
<p>Due to its arrival, the Gu that were crowding around the wooden boat scrambled to escape and quickly disappeared. The originally calm river surface also had burgeoning layers of waves appear.</p>
<p>With such obvious signs, Li Mobai, Gu Shanshui, and company clearly realized the seriousness of the problem. They stared at the river with heavy expressions.</p>
<p>Splash!</p>
<p>A huge wave pushed the wooden boat to the side. If Gu Shanshui hadn’t tried his best to control it, the wooden boat would have capsized.</p>
<p>Li Mobai, Butterfly, and company used their Companion Beasts to block the river water that splashed into the wooden boat. They ensured that the people on the wooden boat wouldn’t be drenched by the river water or have the river water fill the boat.</p>
<p>But soon, everyone’s eyes were attracted by the scene in front of them. They saw a huge body extend out of the river, staring at them like a god. In front of it, the humans and even the wooden boat were as tiny as ants.</p>
<p>Although most of its body was still in the river, preventing one from seeing its full appearance, just the exposed parts were shocking enough.</p>
<p>It was a dragon, but it wasn’t completely one. It had the appearance of a dragon, but its body wasn’t made of flesh and blood. It didn’t have dragon scales or flesh. It looked like a dragon condensed from coral, making it dazzling and strange.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen many dragons—the white dragon in Old Dragon Cave, the black dragon in the underground sea, Torch Dragon in Torch Dragon temple, and even the western dragons.</p>
<p>However, no dragon could be as strange and beautiful as the dragon in front of him.</p>
<p>The coral-like body’s colors changed according to its emotions. It was sometimes as white as jade, sometimes as red as blood, and sometimes rainbow-colored. It was like a huge piece of art.</p>
<p>“Could… Could this be the legendary Dragon King Gu… Heavens… There’s no dragon corpse in the Dragon Corpse River… There’s actually a Dragon King Gu…” Gu Shanshui’s eyes widened as he stared at the gorgeous and terrifying creature in front of him and cried out involuntarily.</p>
<p>Gu Lou and Gu He were even worse off. They collapsed on the boat and even prostrated themselves before the Dragon King Gu.</p>
<p>A person like Zhou Wen who didn’t rear Gu might not understand what the Dragon King Gu meant to people who reared them, but Gu Shanshui and company had already lost their fighting spirit from fear. They were like lambs waiting to be slaughtered.</p>
<p>Legend had it that phoenixes were the nemesis of Gu, while dragons produced all the Gu in the world.</p>
<p>Some regions treated dragons as gods. If humans angered the gods, they would mete down punishment with diseases, plagues, and other disasters.</p>
<p>These disasters were actually caused by Gu, and Gu were living beings that parasitized the Dragon God. They would punish humans who did wrong in the Dragon God’s stead.</p>
<p>From the point of view of modern humans, Gu were parasites on the Dragon God.</p>
<p>Of course, this was only a legend in a certain region. It was unknown if it was true.</p>
<p>However, in the legends of these regions, if the parasites on the Dragon God’s body were extremely powerful, they could turn the situation around, transforming the Dragon God into Gu, then it would form the legendary King of Gu, Dragon King Gu.</p>
<p>This was actually just a local legend. No one had seen a Dragon King Gu before. Even in this era, no one believed that the Gu could really turn the situation and transform the Dragon God into a Gu.</p>
<p>However, this lifeform in front of them undoubtedly possessed the characteristics of dragons and Gu.</p>
<p>It looked like a divine dragon and had a terrifying dragon might, but its body was similar to the structure of coral.</p>
<p>As for the coral itself, it was condensed from many coral worms. The creature in front of them could also be seen as a fusion of countless Gu.</p>
<p>These characteristics were extremely similar to the legendary Dragon King Gu.</p>
<p>Furthermore, ever since this creature, suspected to be the Dragon King Gu, appeared, the Gu on Gu Shanshui, Gu Lou, and Gu He’s bodies began trembling. They could no longer move. It was even more terrifying than the chick’s suppression.</p>
<p>To people who raised Gu, this was undoubtedly fatal.</p>
<p>The chick stood at the bow and chirped at the Dragon King Gu. It looked extremely ferocious, but Zhou Wen, who knew the chick very well, could tell that it was lacking confidence.</p>
<p>Otherwise, with the chick’s personality, it would have spat out phoenix flames and burned the creature in front of it.</p>
<p>The Dragon King Gu stared coldly at the chick and Zhou Wen. It clearly wasn’t as afraid of the chick as the other Gu. It didn’t even treat the chick as a threat.</p>
<p>Although the chick had the phoenix bloodline, it had yet to fully mature. It could restrain ordinary Gu, but an existence like the Dragon King Gu was not something the chick could match.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen noticed that the Dragon King Gu’s gaze was constantly staring at the calabash containing the Corpse Bug. Clearly, it had been attracted by the Corpse Bug.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui picked up the calabash with trembling hands and offered it to the Dragon King Gu. As a person who nurtured Gu, no one dared to resist the Dragon King Gu because it was the supreme god in his heart.</p>
<p>With a flash, Zhou Wen arrived at the bow and took the calabash from Gu Shanshui. He held it in his hand and looked at the Dragon King Gu.</p>
<p>As he was not a Gu-rearing professional, he did not fear the Dragon King Gu. Furthermore, even if he handed over the Corpse Bug in the calabash, the Dragon King Gu might not let them off.</p>
<p>Roar! The Dragon King Gu seemed to be infuriated by Zhou Wen’s actions as it let out a strange roar.</p>
<p>Unlike the dragon’s roar that Zhou Wen had heard before, the Dragon King Gu’s voice was very strange. It had a strange resonance.</p>
<p>Amidst the roar of the Dragon King Gu, Gu Shanshui and company revealed looks of pain. They wrapped their heads with their hands as though bugs were biting at their brains.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also felt as though an extremely tiny creature had drilled into his ears and was about to invade his brain.</p>
<p>“This is a Sound Gu that uses sound… Quickly block your ears… Don’t listen to that sound…” Gu Shanshui shouted in pain.</p>
<p>In fact, under the effects of Truth Listener and Supreme Hell King Life Soul, Zhou Wen had already discovered the Sound Gu hidden in the sound waves. He used the Supreme Hell King Life Soul’s control over his body to seal his hearing and bar the Sound Gu from entry.</p>
<p>“I know you can understand me. Let us leave the Dragon Corpse River and we’ll return the Corpse Bug inside to you. If one of us dies, I’ll reduce it to ashes,” Zhou Wen said to the Dragon King Gu as he raised the calabash in his hand.</p>
<p>The Dragon King Gu was enraged as it spat out dragon breath at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The dragon breath was like a tidal wave that looked extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>The chick opened its mouth and spewed out golden flames. When the golden flames came into contact with the dragon breath, although a portion of the dragon breath was burned away, it was suppressed by the dragon breath. The dragon breath was about to blanket the wooden boat.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui, Gu Lou, and Gu He’s faces were ashen. They didn’t dare resist at all. Although Li Mobai, Butterfly, and Mute had tried their best to block the dragon breath, their efforts were in vain. Their expressions turned ugly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter794'>Chapter 794: Tai Sui’s Might</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Suddenly, the white chick on Zhou Wen’s shoulder flapped its wings and flew in front of the dragon breath. It opened its mouth and sucked in the dragon breath. The dragon breath that filled the sky was sucked into the white chick’s mouth, leaving nothing behind.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui, Butterfly, and company looked at the white chick in a daze. They knew how powerful the chick was and guessed that it was a phoenix descendant.</p>
<p>However, the white-chick form that Tai Sui took on didn’t appear too conspicuous. Furthermore, it didn’t look like a fire-elemental creature. It couldn’t be a descendant of a phoenix.</p>
<p>Furthermore, phoenixes were rare. One was extremely lucky to have one. It was hard to imagine that a person could have two phoenixes.</p>
<p>In addition, Tai Sui usually seemed to be in a daze and didn’t move much. Most of the time, it stood motionless on Zhou Wen’s shoulder. They didn’t pay much attention to the silly white chick, believing that it was only an ordinary Companion Beast at the Epic stage.</p>
<p>However, to their surprise, Tai Sui opened its mouth and swallowed the dragon breath of the Dragon King Gu, as though nothing had happened. They were pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>Although Tai Sui was powerful, it wasn’t really invincible. The main thing was that the dragon breath of the Dragon King Gu was different from real dragon breath.</p>
<p>The dragon breath of the Dragon King Gu was somewhat similar to the corpse fog of the Corpse Bug. It was formed from a large number of miniature Gu, and Tai Sui was the nemesis of these things.</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn’t just the dragon breath. Even the Dragon King Gu itself was a complicated microscopic agglomerate. To Tai Sui, the Dragon King Gu’s body was a feast.</p>
<p>Tai Sui flapped its wings and charged at the Dragon King Gu. The Dragon King Gu clearly didn’t know how powerful Tai Sui was. It opened its mouth and swallowed Tai Sui who was flying towards it.</p>
<p>Everyone was alarmed. They originally thought that the white bird could fight the Dragon King Gu, but to their surprise, it was swallowed in one mouthful.</p>
<p>The Dragon King Gu was the king of all Gu. Its body contained all kinds of microscopic Gu. If one was swallowed by it, they would be invaded by large numbers of Gu. Even a Mythical creature might not be able to withstand it.</p>
<p>But at that moment, Gu Shanshui and company suddenly saw the Dragon King Gu roar at the sky as though it was in extreme pain. Then, they saw a small hole appear in its abdomen. Tai Sui crawled out and pecked at the Dragon King Gu’s body.</p>
<p>The Dragon King Gu’s body was filled with Gu. Ignoring the fact that it had just been eaten, ordinary creatures would be parasitized by the Gu just by touching it. Even Mythical creatures would probably die tragically.</p>
<p>The white bird’s casual pecking at the Dragon King Gu’s body was unbelievable.</p>
<p>“Is that really the Dragon King Gu? It can’t be fake, right?” Gu Lou had a look of doubt. How could the legendary king of innumerable Gu, Dragon King Gu, be casually eaten by a small white chick?</p>
<p>Tai Sui circled around the Dragon King Gu and pecked at it, leaving holes in its body.</p>
<p>The Dragon King Gu released terrifying dragon breaths and might, but they were useless against Tai Sui. Tai Sui was the nemesis of microscopic creatures. Even Tyrant Behemoth might be parasitized by the Gu on the Dragon King Gu. Even Torch Dragon found it difficult to withstand the Dragon King Gu’s power. After all, the Dragon King Gu was transformed from a Gu that devoured a true dragon. It was naturally effective against dragons.</p>
<p>Tai Sui happened to be the nemesis of the Dragon King Gu. No matter how powerful the Dragon King Gu was, it was still pecked by Tai Sui.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui and the rest watched in a daze as the Dragon King Gu was eaten by the small white chick. In the end, it escaped into the water and tore through the bottom of the river. The legendary king of innumerable Gu had actually escaped just like that.</p>
<p>Tai Sui’s body swelled up as it couldn’t eat any more. Furthermore, it wasn’t fast, so it couldn’t catch up to the Dragon King Gu underwater. It flew back and landed on Zhou Wen’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui and company looked at Tai Sui on Zhou Wen’s shoulder in surprise. They originally imagined that the chick with the phoenix bloodline was already a god-like existence, but they never expected the nameless, white chick which definitely wasn’t a phoenix was even more terrifying. Even the Dragon King Gu could only be trampled by it. It even fled in such a sorry state. It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>Unlike the chick, although Tai Sui looked similar to the chick, it didn’t have the aura or ability of a phoenix. Gu Shanshui and Li Mobai couldn’t deduce its origins.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen handed the calabash back to Gu Shanshui. “Master Gu, let’s leave this place now.”</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui didn’t reach out to take the calabash. “Mr. Zhou, if it weren’t for you, we wouldn’t even be alive. How would I have the nerve to take this Corpse Bug? It’s best you keep it.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen said with a smile, “I don’t know how to tame Gu. What’s the point of keeping it? Master Gu, if you feel apologetic, teach me a few Gu nurturing techniques when we return.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou, it’s my honor that you are willing to learn how to rear Gu from me. I will definitely teach you everything and not hide anything,” Gu Shanshui said seriously.</p>
<p>“Let’s talk when we get back. This isn’t a place to talk,” Zhou Wen said as he handed the calabash to Gu Shanshui.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui didn’t decline. After carefully putting away the calabash, he steered the boat towards the exit of Dragon Corpse River.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked in the direction the Dragon King Gu had vanished with a strange look in his eyes.</p>
<p>If not for Tai Sui, even with a Mythical Companion Beast, defeating the Dragon King Gu wouldn’t be easy. Furthermore, it was very likely that they would be parasitized by the Gu before the battle began.</p>
<p>However, even Tai Sui only managed to injure the Dragon King Gu. The energy contained in its body was too immense. Tai Sui couldn’t digest it all.</p>
<p>What caught Zhou Wen’s attention was that the Primordial Spore that he had placed in the river had taken the opportunity to enter the Dragon King Gu’s body, as though it wanted to parasitize it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen could sense that the Primordial Spore had yet to succeed. Now that it had been taken away by the Dragon King Gu, Zhou Wen could only sense that the Primordial Spore was still alive due to the distance. The connection between them had become very weak. He didn’t know how the Primordial Spore was doing in the Dragon King Gu’s body.</p>
<p>If I can successfully parasitize it and take the Dragon King Gu for my own, I’ll have nothing to be afraid of in the South District, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t too worried about the safety of the Primordial Spore. It had an Eternal Immortality Life Providence, so killing it wasn’t an easy task.</p>
<p>However, it would take a long time to parasitize a Mythical creature. Zhou Wen couldn’t wait for it in Dragon Corpse River, so he could only leave.</p>
<p>Without the threat of the Dragon King Gu, the other Gu were afraid of the chick, so none of them dared to rush over. The group successfully left Dragon Corpse River.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could also sense the existence of Primordial Spore outside Dragon Corpse River. Although the connection was very weak, it was enough to determine whether Primordial Spore was still alive and its location.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t see any tiny palm symbols along the way and couldn’t help but find it a pity. The Dragon Corpse River had no fewer Gu than the Valley of No Return. If he could download it into a game dungeon, it would be a good place to grind. Unfortunately, he couldn’t find the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<h3 id='chapter795'>Chapter 795: Discovered</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>After returning to Chiang Rai, he didn’t see Li Xuan and Worm Dugu. Presumably, the two of them had yet to return from the Ice Silkworm Gu King’s place.</p>
<p>Gu Shanshui wanted to think of a way to get a container to rear the Corpse Bug. Therefore, he returned to Mong Hsat overnight.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t follow Gu Shanshui to Mong Hsat. He decided to get the calabash back at Mong Hsat in a few days.</p>
<p>He chose to stay because he wanted to visit the Xiao family and figure out the matter between Xiao Si and Wang Chan.</p>
<p>Li Mobai also planned on staying in Chiang Rai for a few more days before heading off with Zhou Wen to Mong Hsat.</p>
<p>That night, Zhou Wen used the Invisibility Cloak and headed for the Xiao family. He planned on infiltrating the family to see if he could find out anything.</p>
<p>The Xiao family lived in an exotic manor. Before he arrived, Zhou Wen realized a problem. There were many Gu lurking in the grass on both sides of the road. If it wasn’t for Zhou Wen’s Supreme Hell King Life Soul and Truth Listener’s ability, heightening Zhou Wen’s senses, it would be difficult for ordinary people to discover the Gu.</p>
<p>The Xiao family sure is careful. They even planted Gu outside the manor. Zhou Wen didn’t know much about Gu, so he didn’t know which Gu relied on smell to distinguish the enemy or sound. Therefore, he flew into the manor from the sky to avoid alerting the Gu.</p>
<p>However, after entering the manor, Zhou Wen realized that although the manor’s layout was very dense, this was only the periphery of the Xiao family. Behind the manor was a valley which was a dimensional zone. The Xiao family’s true headquarters was built in a dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Using Truth Listener’s ability to constantly scan the area, he found the various hidden mechanisms and traps of the Xiao family.</p>
<p>With the Xiao family’s guards guarding the entrance to the dimensional zone, that was secondary. It was impossible for four Legendary humans to see through Zhou Wen’s invisibility.</p>
<p>What caught Zhou Wen’s attention was that there was a statue at the entrance of the dimensional zone. The statue looked very odd. It was a Buddha statue, but it was different from the Buddha statue Zhou Wen had seen in Dragon Gate Grotto. Not only did it look ferocious and terrifying, but it also had a vertical eye at its glabella and a strange fork in its hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had never seen such a Buddha statue before, but the statue’s carvings were similar to the ones used in Buddhism. A Buddhistic glow was engraved on its back.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could vaguely sense an aura similar to a Gu Mantong from the Buddha statue.</p>
<p>The Spirit Body’s vision is somewhat different from humans. It’s not just about the form. It’s probably impossible to fool that Buddha statue with ordinary invisibility. Zhou Wen decided to activate the Wheel of Destiny of the Invisibility Cloak and completely conceal his body before entering the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>As expected, the guards and Buddha statues didn’t notice him and Zhou Wen successfully entered the valley. The moment he entered, he found it difficult to breathe as though there was no oxygen in the valley.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t discover any Gu and immediately knew that it was the taboo power of this dimensional zone. He had to switch to the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and immediately, the suffocating feeling vanished.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t have the keen senses of the Supreme Hell King, it didn’t make a difference with Truth Listener around. Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to scan the entire valley before quickly moving in.</p>
<p>As the Invisibility Cloak’s Wheel of Destiny only had three minutes, he had to figure out the situation in the dimensional zone in those three minutes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that such a valley would have all sorts of Gu, but in fact, there weren’t any. There was only one temple in the valley, but the style was very different from the one in Luoyang. It was obvious that it was the local style of Chiang Rai.</p>
<p>There was no one outside the temple, but there were many people inside. They were likely members of the Xiao family. Some were practicing their techniques, while others were directing Gu. It was rather lively.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen entered the temple’s yard, he felt that there was no reaction from the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. He knew that there was no taboo power here.</p>
<p>As they trusted the guards outside the manor and the taboo power in the valley, the temple’s internal defenses weren’t as strict. Zhou Wen looked inside and realized that the deities in the temple hall weren’t the Buddhist eminences he was familiar with. Instead, they were dolls of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>Are all the ones consecrated here Kuman Thong and Kuman Nee? Zhou Wen scanned the area and saw many dolls in the shapes of boys and girls. He roughly knew what they were.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in them and he rushed straight to the backyard. He didn’t have much time left. Although he wasn’t afraid of being exposed, it would be impossible for him to eavesdrop if he was.</p>
<p>The temple was rather large and there were quite a number of courtyards inside. Each courtyard had different Kuman Thong, making it look sinister and terrifying.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had always felt that these religious buildings weren’t aesthetically pleasing. Regardless of the religion, they gave him an uneasy feeling.</p>
<p>Along the way, he encountered quite a number of people from the Xiao family, but they didn’t say anything that piqued Zhou Wen’s interest. Seeing that the three minutes were up, Zhou Wen realized that there wasn’t anyone in the nearby yard, so he decided to enter the yard first.</p>
<p>After entering the yard, the three minutes of invisibility ended. Zhou Wen wore the Invisibility Cloak and could only achieve the effects of visual invisibility. His body didn’t vanish completely.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there weren’t many people here. The yard wasn’t big, and there was only a temple hall inside. The door was open, and strangely, there was a black cloth hanging in front of the door.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to scan the interior and realized that the tiny temple hall was eerie and terrifying. The decorations inside were very simple. There was a wooden table with a Kuman Thong on it.</p>
<p>The Kuman Thong was jade-like and curled into a ball. There was a crystal container outside, and the yellow liquid inside wrapped around the Kuman Thong. Zhou Wen now had a vague idea that it was Corpse Oil.</p>
<p>Seeing that there was nothing inside, Zhou Wen didn’t enter. Just as he was about to continue searching the temple, he suddenly saw a girl standing in front of him.</p>
<p>The girl didn’t look too old. She was at most eighteen or nineteen years old. She wore strange clothes and looked rather delicate, but for some reason, she had a sinister look as she stared coldly at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt his hair stand on end when the girl stared at him.</p>
<p>She can see me? Zhou Wen was thinking of how to deal with such a situation.</p>
<p>The other party was only a girl whom he had no grudges with. Zhou Wen couldn’t bring himself to draw his saber to kill her.</p>
<p>However, the girl was strange. She only stared coldly at Zhou Wen without shouting or screaming.</p>
<p>Could it be that she didn’t see me? Zhou Wen was suspicious as he attempted to take two steps to the left.</p>
<p>The girl’s pupils moved to the left as he moved. Zhou Wen took a few steps to the right and the girl’s pupils shifted to the right again. She kept staring at him, clearly able to see the invisible Zhou Wen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter796'>Chapter 796: Strange Girl</h3>

<p>The girl kept looking at Zhou Wen, but she didn’t shout or scream. Neither did she look flustered.</p>
<p>This left Zhou Wen in a dilemma. If the girl had shown a hostile stance or screamed, he would have long taken action to put her down.</p>
<p>However, with her looking at him without making a fuss, it wasn’t appropriate for Zhou Wen to attack.</p>
<p>There are so many people in the Xiao family that the girl might not recognize all of them. Could it be that she doesn’t know that I’m not from the Xiao family? After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that it was very likely. Otherwise, there was no reason for the girl not to call for help.</p>
<p>If he were someone who had a glib tongue, he might be able to fool the girl and get some information from her.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen wasn’t eloquent, so he only gave the girl a friendly smile. He pretended to be strolling around and wanted to leave the yard.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a few steps to the side, hoping to circle around the girl, but she took two steps to block his path. Clearly, she wasn’t willing to let him go.</p>
<p>“Ahem, sorry. I got lost. Sorry for disturbing you,” Zhou Wen said as he took a few steps to the other side, hoping to circle around the girl.</p>
<p>The girl blocked his path again, but she had no intention of attacking. She didn’t seem to have any intention of shouting.</p>
<p>“Why are you stopping me? Is there anything I can help you with?” Zhou Wen planned on trying to convince the girl with his bad eloquence.</p>
<p>The girl remained silent as she continued looking at him, sizing him up.</p>
<p>Is the Xiao family that odd? Zhou Wen found the girl odd.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that her actions were incomprehensible, Zhou Wen hadn’t seen her when he entered the yard. With Truth Listener’s ability, it was impossible for Zhou Wen not to notice that there was someone in the yard.</p>
<p>However, when the girl stood behind him, Zhou Wen really couldn’t work out where she had come from.</p>
<p>Could it be that this girl isn’t human but a ghost? Zhou Wen carefully sized up the girl, but he didn’t discover anything wrong with her. She looked like a normal human girl.</p>
<p>The girl remained silent. Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, he realized that someone was walking towards the yard.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked into the yard. Apart from the temple hall, there were no other obstructions.</p>
<p>After glancing at the girl, Zhou Wen gestured for her to remain silent before heading deeper into the temple hall.</p>
<p>The girl being able to see him didn’t mean that others could see him. Zhou Wen planned on hiding and giving it a try. Since he had already been exposed, the situation couldn’t be any worse.</p>
<p>There was an offering table in the temple hall without any additional decorations. Just as Zhou Wen was thinking about where to hide, he saw the girl walk in.</p>
<p>With the girl following Zhou Wen, even if others couldn’t see the invisible Zhou Wen, they would discover his existence because of her.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to take action and put the girl down, he saw her point at a cloth curtain in the corner of the temple hall, indicating for him to hide behind it.</p>
<p>The two people had already arrived at the yard’s entrance. Zhou Wen didn’t dare say another word, afraid that they would hear him. All he could do was look at the girl and point at himself before pointing at the curtain.</p>
<p>The girl seemed to understand what he meant and nodded.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tiptoed to the back of the curtain.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen steadied himself, he heard the door to the yard open. The two people walked in and quickly entered the temple hall.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of being discovered. If he was discovered, he could just storm his way out. However, that would mean a failure to obtain any information.</p>
<p>The two of them walked into the room and didn’t pay attention to the back of the curtain. Clearly, they hadn’t expected someone to be hiding here. Furthermore, Zhou Wen was invisible. It was difficult to discover him with the naked eye.</p>
<p>However, what puzzled Zhou Wen was that they ignored the girl as though she wasn’t there.</p>
<p>The two people who entered the temple hall were no longer young. They were probably at least fifty years old.</p>
<p>After entering the temple hall, one of the men placed something on the offering table. It was a small metal furnace with many tiny holes on it. Wisps of smoke emitted from the tiny holes.</p>
<p>The smoke didn’t rise vertically. It seemed to be attracted by some force and floated towards the Kuman Thong on the offering table.</p>
<p>The man bowed to the Kuman Thong before walking to the side.</p>
<p>“Liuqi, have you investigated the matter regarding Si’er?” the man who had placed the incense asked.</p>
<p>“According to the intelligence sent by the spies in the Imperial Capital, Xiao Si went to the Great Wall with Wang Chan. There was likely another person with them. This person has a good relationship with Wang Chan, so we haven’t found out who it is yet,” Xiao Liuqi answered.</p>
<p>“In your opinion, could it be that the Wang family discovered our goal and deliberately eliminated Si’er?” Xiao Tianfang said with a frown.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, it shouldn’t be. If the Wang family really discovered our goal, they definitely wouldn’t only target Xiao Si alone. They also wouldn’t give us any explanation about Xiao Si and might have even severed relations with our Xiao family. But there aren’t any signs of that,” Xiao Liuqi said.</p>
<p>Xiao Tianfang sighed and said, “The Wang family is a family clan in the East District after all. Even if they are stronger than our Xiao family, it won’t be easy for them to come to the South District to touch our Xiao family. I’m not afraid that they will fall out with us. Unfortunately, with Si’er’s death, I’m afraid our plan won’t have a chance.”</p>
<p>“Tianfang, is there nothing else that can replace Wang Chan’s Life Providence?” Xiao Liuqi asked.</p>
<p>“If there was a replacement, we wouldn’t have taken such a huge risk to target the Wang family.” Xiao Tianfang explained, “We’ve studied the Gu Lady Kuman Nee for so many years. Although she successfully advanced to the Mythical level, she still can’t be controlled freely. In recent years, our control over her has become weaker and weaker. Refining her into a Life Soul is even more impossible.”</p>
<p>“Now that she’s already at the Mythical level, it’s impossible to refine her into a Life Soul. However, using Wang Chan’s Goddess of Misfortune Life Providence, we can create a Misfortune Kuman Nee and let her suppress and influence the Gu Lady Kuman Nee. This way, we can take the opportunity to firmly grasp them both,” Xiao Tianfang said.</p>
<p>“Can a Heaven Baby replace the Misfortune Kuman Nee?” Xiao Liuqi asked.</p>
<p>“It’s not that simple. Gu Lady Kuman Nee is the reincarnation of a Gu God. Before she was born, we forcefully refined her into a Kuman Nee. Although she’s not a real god, she’s not something an ordinary Kuman Thong can compare to. Only some especially powerful Kuman Thong can influence her. Currently, the best chance we have is to refine Wang Chan into a Misfortune Kuman Nee. The other methods are even more difficult and impossible to realize,” Xiao Tianfang said.</p>

<p>Having heard their conversation, how could Zhou Wen not understand what was happening? The Dugu family’s guess was right. Back then, the ones who killed the mother and dug out the fetus weren’t Gu, but the members of the Xiao family.</p>
<p>They cultivated the fetus into a Kuman Nee and raised it to the Mythical level.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s understanding of Kuman Nee was very limited. He didn’t know how Kuman Nee matured, but he believed that the Xiao family had tried their best.</p>
<p>Now that they couldn’t control the Kuman Nee anymore, they wanted to refine Wang Chan into another Kuman Nee to restrain Gu Lady Kuman Nee.</p>
<p>What a diabolical Xiao family. In such an era, it’s not wrong to desire becoming stronger. It’s not wrong to use all sorts of means, but to be so vicious, one has to be prepared to be treated the same way by others. Zhou Wen’s heart was filled with killing intent.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to summon the Light Concealment Sword and kill Xiao Liuqi and Xiao Tianfang first. The two of them definitely weren’t innocent. He could make a judgment on the other members of the Xiao family when the time came.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to make a move, he suddenly realized that the girl was standing in front of him, seemingly trying to stop him from making a move on Xiao Liuqi and Xiao Tianfang.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the girl in front of him and suddenly understood something. He thought to himself, Could this girl be the Gu Lady they refined into a Kuman Nee?</p>
<p>The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that it was possible. The person enshrined in the temple hall was likely Gu Lady Kuman Nee. Then, this strange girl might very well be the Gu Lady after growing up.</p>
<p>Typically, Kuman Nee wouldn’t grow, but after combining a Kuman Nee and an Essence Energy Art, anything was possible.</p>
<p>She’s now under the Xiao family’s control. If I kill the Xiao family, she will definitely become my enemy. With this in mind, Zhou Wen temporarily didn’t take action.</p>
<p>Gu Lady was a pitiful person. If she wasn’t born magical, she wouldn’t have been harmed by the Xiao family. Even her parents died tragically. She was refined into Kuman Nee before she was born. It could be said that she was extremely tragic.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if she could survive if he killed her master, so he decided not to take action.</p>
<p>Xiao Tianfang thought for a moment and continued, “Regardless of whether the Wang family has noticed it or not, let’s put Wang Chan’s matter aside for now. Let’s try our best to capture the Ice Silkworm Gu King. If we have the Ice Silkworm Gu King, we won’t have to rely too much on Gu Lady’s strength.”</p>
<p>“It’s not easy to capture the Ice Silkworm Gu King. I originally thought that with Gu Lady’s help, we would be able to capture the Ice Silkworm Gu King. After knowing that the Ice Silkworm Gu King isn’t just one, but a pair, Gu Lady probably isn’t a match for the pair of Ice Silkworm Gu Kings either. I still need to think of something else,” Xiao Liuqi said.</p>
<p>“How’s the taming of the Mythical Blood Scorpion Gu going? Can it be put to use?” Xiao Tianfang asked after some thought.</p>
<p>Xiao Liuqi said with a bitter smile, “I don’t know why, but the Mythical Gu that we used Gu Lady to capture are especially difficult to tame. The three from before were domesticated for so long, but they refuse to yield no matter what. This one is slightly better, but it’s barely under our control. It can’t be controlled freely.”</p>
<p>“That’s enough. Let’s take it with us to distract the Ice Silkworm Gu Kings. As long as the pair of Ice Silkworm Gu Kings are separated, Gu Lady should be more than enough to deal with one.” Xiao Tianfang looked at Kuman Nee on the offering table and continued, “Prepare the Blood Scorpion Gu. We’ll go tomorrow to prevent any delays. Worm Dugu is also eyeing the pair of Ice Silkworms. We can’t let him succeed ahead of us.”</p>
<p>“I understand. I’ll prepare now,” Xiao Liuqi replied.</p>
<p>“Do a good job. In the future, the position of family head will be taken over by you. However, as family head, you need to have strength that can convince everyone. If you can successfully capture the pair of Ice Silkworm Gu Kings, you can tame and control one of them,” Xiao Tianfang said.</p>
<p>“Tianfang, you are still in your prime…” Xiao Liuqi was immediately overjoyed, but he didn’t dare show it.</p>
<p>Xiao Tianfang waved his hand. “I know myself. All these years, in order to suppress Gu Lady, my body has been deteriorating day by day. My mind is also failing. In the future, the Xiao family will have to rely on you. You should also shoulder the responsibility.”</p>
<p>“Tianfang, don’t worry. I definitely won’t let you down,” Xiao Liuqi hurriedly said.</p>
<p>“Alright, make the preparation. I hope that capturing the Ice Silkworm Gu King will go smoothly.” Xiao Tianfang gestured for Xiao Liuqi to leave.</p>
<p>After Xiao Liuqi left, Xiao Tianfang stood in front of the Kuman Nee. He reached out to touch the crystal barrier outside and said with a strange expression, “It’s been so many years, but I still haven’t been able to completely tame you. Now, my plan to capture Wang Chan and refine her into a Misfortune Kuman Nee has also failed. If you still don’t submit, I can only take the final step. My body really can’t take it anymore. After I obtain the Ice Silkworm Gu King, I’ll completely erase your consciousness. Although that will greatly reduce the Kuman Nee’s spirituality and abilities, you’ve forced me into a corner. I can only take such measures…”</p>
<p>Xiao Tianfang looked at the Kuman Nee for a while before leaving the yard.</p>
<p>From beginning to end, the girl stood in front of Zhou Wen, preventing him from harming Xiao Tianfang.</p>
<p>“Why are you protecting him when he caused you to be in this state?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>The girl remained silent, but Zhou Wen seemed to think of a reason. He asked, “Is it because he’s your master? If he dies, will you be injured?”</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the girl nodded, as though confirming Zhou Wen’s words.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was overjoyed when he saw the girl finally react. He asked, “Then is there a way to prevent you from being injured?”</p>
<p>The girl just looked at him without answering.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen snapped to his senses and knew that the girl couldn’t speak. Therefore, he pointed at Kuman Nee on the offering table and said, “If he transfers that to me, will you be ok after he dies?”</p>
<p>The girl reacted this time and nodded again.</p>
<p>“Alright, I know what to do. Wait a few days. I’ll quickly rescue you,” Zhou Wen said to the girl before turning to leave the temple hall.</p>
<p>The girl seemed to understand what he meant and didn’t stop him. After Zhou Wen left the yard, he temporarily left the Xiao family.</p>
<p>Gu Lady was very magical, so Zhou Wen didn’t wish to see her die with Xiao Tianfang. He planned on getting her transferred to him before settling Wang Chan’s score with the Xiao family.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen left the Xiao family, he returned to his residence and gave Gu Shanshui a call. Thankfully, he had already arrived at Mong Hsat and had a phone signal. He quickly answered the call.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen asked some questions about Kuman Thong and Kuman Nee and confirmed that his plan was feasible.</p>
<p>That night, Worm Dugu and Li Xuan returned together. The situation didn’t look good. Worm Dugu’s expression was especially nasty.</p>
<p>Li Xuan didn’t jibe either. Zhou Wen knew that Worm Dugu’s failure must have been tragic, so Li Xuan didn’t say a word.</p>
<h3 id='chapter798'>Chapter 798: Ice Silkworm</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Why don’t we forget our bet? It was just a joke to begin with,” Li Xuan said to Worm Dugu.</p>
<p>“What joke? I, Worm Dugu, am a man of my word. If I can’t capture the Ice Silkworm Gu King for you, I’ll be your disciple,” Worm Dugu said angrily.</p>
<p>Li Xuan said with a smile, “I’ve seen your abilities. If there was only one Ice Silkworm Gu King, you would definitely be able to capture it. But now, there are two. This is unexpected. Just count ourselves even. No one is losing to anyone. Isn’t that fair?”</p>
<p>“No, a man’s word is worth its weight in gold. If I can’t capture the Ice Silkworm Worm, I’ll acknowledge you as my master. I won’t go back on my word.” With that said, Worm Dugu turned to Zhou Wen and said, “If Li Xuan is my master, Zhou Wen, you will be my uncle-master. It’s not too much for an uncle-master to teach me some skills, right?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Worm Dugu with his mouth agape. He found it unbelievable that this fellow was from the Dugu family—one of the six hero families. He was too shameless.</p>
<p>“Nice, was this your plan from the beginning?” Li Xuan was taken aback when he heard that. Only then did he realize that he had been fooled.</p>
<p>Worm Dugu chuckled and said, “My motto as a human is to be pragmatic. So what if I acknowledge you as my master? You still need me to teach you how to rear Gu. On the surface, you are my master, but in reality, I’m still your master. It’s just a title. It doesn’t matter. If Zhou Wen can teach me how to rear a phoenix, don’t mention me calling him uncle-master, I can even call him grandmaster.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were dumbfounded. This was the first time they had seen someone like Worm Dugu. It was an eye-opener.</p>
<p>“I really don’t know how to rear a phoenix. This silly bird insisted on following me. I usually don’t care about it. It eats whatever it gets. I can’t teach you,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Worm Dugu immediately shook his head and said, “No, no. I’ve long read about the phoenix’s habits and eating habits in ancient books. If I had a phoenix divine bird, I would know how to feed it myself. You don’t have to teach me.”</p>
<p>“Then what can you learn from me? Don’t tell me you want me to help you find another phoenix? I don’t have that ability,” Zhou Wen said, puzzled.</p>
<p>“I know how to feed one, but I don’t have a phoenix. I just want to learn from you. How can I make a phoenix be willing to follow me?” Worm Dugu said.</p>
<p>“I already said that this silly bird is naturally willing to follow me. There aren’t any tricks involved. Perhaps it’s because of my relatively good character,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou is right. Back when the three of us encountered the chick, only Old Zhou was chosen,” Li Xuan added.</p>
<p>“Everything in this world follows cause and effect. It’s impossible for there to be no cause. If there’s no cause, it means that you haven’t discovered the cause. It might be because the Essence Energy Art you cultivate is rather special, or it might be because you have a hidden special physique. It might also be because something on you attracted it. In short, there must be a reason. That’s the reason I need to know.”</p>
<p>Worm Dugu wasn’t serious for long before he said to Zhou Wen with a cheeky smile, “Anyway, it’s highly likely that I won’t be able to catch an Ice Silkworm this time. In the future, you will be my Uncle-Master Zhou. If you like teaching, teach. If you don’t like teaching, let me follow by your side while I self-study…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wish to speak to Worm Dugu again. He turned to Li Xuan and said, “I’ll help you capture the Ice Silkworm Gu King tomorrow. However, after capturing it, lend it to me for two days.”</p>
<p>“Lend? How?” Worm Dugu curled his lips and said, “Gu can’t be transferred once it recognizes its owner. How can you return it after borrowing it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want the Ice Silkworm Gu King to recognize me as its master. I just need to borrow it to do something. I’ll return it to you when I’m done,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“No problem at all. You can even take it, much less borrow it,” Li Xuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>Worm Dugu was a little displeased when he heard that. “If you want to use the phoenix to capture the Ice Silkworm Gu King, I advise you not to go. Although the phoenix is powerful, it’s only a baby. The Ice Silkworm Gu King won’t be afraid of it. If you aren’t careful, you might even kill the phoenix. That would be a huge loss.”</p>
<p>“We’ll see how to do it when we are there tomorrow.” Zhou Wen also knew that it wouldn’t be easy to capture the Ice Silkworm Gu King. However, the Xiao family was going to capture it tomorrow. This was the opportunity he wanted.</p>
<p>He wanted to snatch the Ice Silkworm Gu King from the Xiao family before using it to exchange for Gu Lady.</p>
<p>Offering an exchange of two Ice Silkworm Gu Kings for a Kuman Nee which might kill Xiao Tianfang, Xiao Tianfang would definitely do so as long as he wasn’t a fool.</p>
<p>After all, he had already planned on wiping out Gu Lady’s spiritual consciousness. When that happened, Kuman Nee’s ability would be greatly reduced. She would probably be inferior to an Ice Silkworm. With such a comparison, anyone would know what to choose.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll see how you capture the Ice Silkworm Gu King tomorrow. If you can capture it, I, Worm Dugu, will immediately acknowledge the two of you as master and uncle-master,” said Worm Dugu. Clearly, he wasn’t optimistic about Zhou Wen’s chances.</p>
<p>“Forget it. There’s no sense of accomplishment being your master,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“You can’t say that. You might not feel a sense of accomplishment now, but if you were to travel in the South District and meet someone from the Dugu family and say that you are Worm Dugu’s master, how awesome would that be? You wouldn’t have a feeling of zero accomplishment,” Worm Dugu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan looked at him in contempt. With his personality, it was unknown how many masters and uncle-masters he had acknowledged outside. It would be odd if the Dugu family was willing to take that into account.</p>
<p>The next day before dawn, Zhou Wen woke up Li Xuan and Worm Dugu and got them to lead him to the place where the Ice Silkworm Gu Kings were.</p>
<p>He had heard Xiao Tianfang and Xiao Liuqi’s conversation and knew that the Xiao family was going at this time. If he went late, the Xiao family might have already succeeded.</p>
<p>It wasn’t good to go early either. If they captured the Ice Silkworm Gu King before the Xiao family arrived, the Xiao family wouldn’t know that the Ice Silkworm Gu Kings were in Zhou Wen’s hands.</p>
<p>Although Worm Dugu was somewhat puzzled as to why Zhou Wen had to go so early, he still took the two of them to Yin Wind Ridge.</p>
<p>When they arrived, they realized that someone was already fighting the Ice Silkworm Gu Kings. The two people spearheading the attack were none other than Xiao Liuqi and Xiao Tianfang.</p>
<p>In front of Xiao Tianfang was an ice-blue silkworm the size of a football. Wherever it crawled, the ground was immediately covered in frost. It was obvious how low the temperature was.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder Worm Dugu said that the chick probably can’t restrain the Ice Silkworm. With such ice-elemental powers, the chick’s phoenix flames will definitely be much less effective against it, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Xiao Liuqi noticed Zhou Wen and company. When he saw Worm Dugu, his expression changed slightly. Clearly, he was afraid that Worm Dugu would snatch the Ice Silkworm Gu Kings.</p>
<h3 id='chapter799'>Chapter 799: Gu Lady in Battle</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Strange, why is there only one Ice Silkworm? Where did the other Ice Silkworm go?” Worm Dugu frowned.</p>
<p>“Could it be that the Xiao family lured the two Ice Silkworms apart?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>Worm Dugu shook his head and said, “These two Ice Silkworms are a pair. They have something akin to telepathy abilities. It’s not that easy to separate them. If I could separate them, I would have long ago. The Xiao family wouldn’t even stand a chance.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps you don’t have the ability to do so. Just because you can’t lure them apart doesn’t mean they can’t either,” Li Yue said deliberately.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Worm Dugu wasn’t angry this time. He thought for a moment and said, “That’s very possible.”</p>
<p>Li Xuan looked at Worm Dugu in surprise. Every time he mentioned Gu, Worm Dugu would proudly act as though he was number one in the world. It was unbelievable that he would admit that he was inferior to the Xiao family.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to look at me like that. Have you forgotten what I told you? If the Xiao family’s Mythical-level Kuman Thong is really refined from the baby reincarnated from a Gu God, it’s not surprising that they can lure the Ice Silkworm away,” said Worm Dugu.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that what Worm Dugu said was right. It was likely that Gu Lady had lured the Ice Silkworm away.</p>
<p>Xiao Tianfang held the Kuman Nee that was placed in the temple hall, but Gu Lady was nowhere to be seen. She must have lured the other Ice Silkworm away.</p>
<p>This Ice Silkworm was trapped here by the Xiao family and was fighting a blood-colored scorpion.</p>
<p>The Blood Scorpion was clearly no match for the Ice Silkworm. Its body was almost frozen by the ice mist that the Ice Silkworm spewed out. It survived thanks to the Xiao family’s people using all sorts of Gu and Companion Beasts to barely hold back the Ice Silkworm.</p>
<p>As a result, the Xiao family sacrificed a large number of Gu and Companion Beasts. Furthermore, the Xiao family was still using Kuman Thong to augment the Blood Scorpion. This only allowed them to stall the Ice Silkworm.</p>
<p>The Ice Silkworm’s ice aura was extremely powerful. Zhou Wen had seen some ice-elemental Companion Beasts before, but this was the first time he had seen one as powerful as the Ice Silkworm.</p>
<p>As long as one touched its ice aura, be it Gu or Kuman Thong, their bodies would gradually freeze.</p>
<p>The ice aura seemed to have a spreading attribute. As long as one touched it, one’s body would become colder. Many Gu only touched a tiny bit of the ice aura. In the beginning, it wasn’t too big a problem, but after a while, they would freeze into ice and eventually shatter.</p>
<p>“Should we take action? Now that the two Ice Silkworms have been separated, it’s a great opportunity,” Li Xuan asked Worm Dugu.</p>
<p>“There’s no rush. Let’s wait and see. They aren’t a match for the Ice Silkworm.” Worm Dugu paused before saying, “After all, our Dugu family is the king of the South District. We can’t behave excessively. Otherwise, I’ll be nagged by those fellows at home. It will be a headache.”</p>
<p>When the Xiao family saw that Worm Dugu and company only stayed in the distance and had no intention of going forward, they couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“Tianfang, do you think Worm Dugu will snatch our Ice Silkworm?” Xiao Liuqi whispered to Xiao Tianfang.</p>
<p>Xiao Tianfang said with a heavy expression, “The Dugu family controls the South District. On the surface, they do things fairly, so they might not openly snatch it. However, we still have to be on guard. I hope that Gu Lady can quickly capture the other Ice Silkworm.”</p>
<p>“How’s the situation on Gu Lady’s side?” Xiao Liuqi asked.</p>
<p>“It’s very vague. I only know that they are fighting,” Xiao Tianfang said.</p>
<p>“Tianfang, your perception of Gu Lady is getting weaker and weaker. Will there be a problem?” Xiao Liuqi asked worriedly.</p>
<p>“As long as her main body is in my hands, she won’t be able to resist me. If I let her die, she can only die,” Xiao Tianfang said coldly.</p>
<p>Xiao Liuqi sighed and said, “Gu Lady is really too special. We’ve been rearing her for so many years, but we can’t even see her spirit body. She even implicated you and caused you to suffer a backlash from the Kuman Nee. If we could really make her our own, our Xiao family wouldn’t be limited to a tiny area like Chiang Rai.”</p>
<p>“As long as we can capture this pair of Ice Silkworms and tame them, our Xiao family will also be able to soar,” Xiao Tianfang said.</p>
<p>Xiao Liuqi nodded and said, “Thankfully, there are detailed records of the Ice Silkworm Gu King in the Gu nurturing technique I obtained from the couple. Otherwise, even with the help of Gu Lady, it would be difficult for us to separate the two Ice Silkworms…”</p>
<p>Xiao Tianfang’s expression turned cold. “Didn’t I tell you not to mention that matter again?”</p>
<p>Xiao Liuqi hurriedly said, “Sorry, I misspoke.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was very far away from Xiao Tianfang, but Truth Listener’s ability allowed him to hear their conversation clearly.</p>
<p>I should find Gu Lady and the other Ice Silkworm first. Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to conduct a large-scale search and soon found an Ice Silkworm in a distant swamp, but he didn’t find the Gu Lady.</p>
<p>“Keep an eye on that Ice Silkworm for now. I’ll find the other Ice Silkworm,” Zhou Wen said to Li Xuan before secretly retreating.</p>
<p>Soon, the Xiao family realized that one person was missing from Worm Dugu’s group. However, Worm Dugu was still around. There was only a youth missing, so they weren’t too worried.</p>
<p>After all, even Worm Dugu hadn’t been able to capture the Ice Silkworm. Even if he was a member of the Dugu family, it was impossible for him to capture the Ice Silkworm alone. Furthermore, they had set up mechanisms that would inform Xiao Tianfang and the others if someone approached.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen left, he put on the Invisibility Cloak and quickly approached the other Ice Silkworm.</p>
<p>In the area closest to the Ice Silkworm, he discovered some Gu that had been placed in the swamp. Zhou Wen flew over the Gu without alerting them.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the Ice Silkworm, he saw an ice-blue Ice Silkworm. This Ice Silkworm was slightly bigger than the previous one.</p>
<p>Strangely, Zhou Wen didn’t discover any traces of Gu Lady with Truth Listener, but when he looked with his eyes, he realized that she was confronting the Ice Silkworm.</p>
<p>This is really strange. Truth Listener’s ability can’t discover Gu Lady. Even Xiao Tianfang, the owner of Lady Gu, can’t see her. Why can I see her? Zhou Wen was somewhat perplexed.</p>
<p>If he had used the Supreme Hell King Life Soul, it wouldn’t be strange for him to see a Spirit Body. However, Zhou Wen wasn’t using it. He didn’t even use any special powers to see Gu Lady whom others couldn’t see. This left him very puzzled.</p>
<p>It was a little different from what Zhou Wen had imagined. Xiao Tianfang said that Gu Lady was fighting the Ice Silkworm, but the scene he saw was completely different.</p>
<p>Gu Lady was squatting on the ground and using her fingers to tease the Ice Silkworm. The terrifying Ice Silkworm was like a pet dog, circling around her as the Gu Lady played with it. However, it had no intention of attacking her.</p>
