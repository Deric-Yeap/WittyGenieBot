<h3 id='chapter800'>Chapter 800: Grabbing a Silkworm With One Hand</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“I need this Ice Silkworm Gu King to exchange for your freedom,” Zhou Wen said as he pointed at the Ice Silkworm on the ground.</p>
<p>Gu Lady nodded before tapping the Ice Silkworm. The ferocious and domineering Ice Silkworm obediently crawled towards Zhou Wen and stopped by his feet, but it had no intention of attacking him.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the Xiao family has really underestimated Gu Lady’s strength. If they knew that Gu Lady could easily make a top-notch Gu like the Ice Silkworm obey her orders, I wonder what expression they would have.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took out the Essence Gold Pot that Worm Dugu had prepared and placed it on the ground. The Ice Silkworm jumped in like a tamed pet.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he looked at Gu Lady and asked, “Can you secretly control the other Ice Silkworm Gu and make it look like I’ve captured it?”</p>
<p>Gu Lady nodded again. It looked like she could do it.</p>
<p>“Then control the Ice Silkworm Gu later and let it pretend I’ve caught it.” Zhou Wen recounted his plan to Gu Lady. After confirming that she could understand, Zhou Wen took the Ice Gu in the Essence Gold Pot and sneaked back to Li Xuan and company.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Oh no, Gu Lady failed. Someone stole the Ice Silkworm.” Xiao Tianfang’s expression suddenly changed.</p>
<p>“How is that possible? Who can snatch the Ice Silkworm away from Gu Lady without anyone noticing?” Xiao Liuqi jumped in fright as he said in disbelief.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. The Gu we planted didn’t react at all, and Gu Lady didn’t find any traces of him.” Xiao Tianfang’s expression was ugly as he continued, “I’ve already summoned Gu Lady back. Now, we can only use all our strength to capture this Ice Silkworm.”</p>
<p>Just as Xiao Tianfang said that, he saw Zhou Wen return to Worm Dugu’s side. He exchanged a few words with Worm Dugu before walking towards the Ice Silkworm.</p>
<p>“Could he have snatched the other Ice Silkworm?” Xiao Tianfang’s heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>Xiao Liuqi had already led his men to block Zhou Wen, preventing him from approaching the battlefield. At the same time, he shouted at Worm Dugu, “Old Master Dugu, we are capturing this Ice Silkworm. Isn’t it inappropriate for you to interfere?”</p>
<p>Worm Dugu said with a smile, “I’m still here! I didn’t even move. When did I interfere with your matters?”</p>
<p>“The Dugu family has always been open and aboveboard. Old Master Dugu, are you trying to say that this friend isn’t a member of the Dugu family?” Xiao Liuqi pointed at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I really wish he was a member of our Dugu family, but unfortunately, he’s not.” Worm Dugu didn’t wait for Xiao Liuqi to say anything before continuing, “But you can’t say that he has nothing to do with our Dugu family. Although he’s not a member of our Dugu family, he’s my uncle-master.”</p>
<p>Xiao Liuqi, Xiao Tianfang, and company were alarmed. Although Worm Dugu wasn’t an authoritative figure in the Dugu family, his seniority was rather high. Furthermore, he was very famous for raising Gu. He was a famous master in the South District.</p>
<p>Yet, Worm Dugu said that the youth in front of them was his uncle-master. It was somewhat unbelievable, but a figure like Worm Dugu clearly wouldn’t joke about such matters.</p>
<p>Could it be that this person has already cultivated to the point of returning to his youth? He looks young, but he’s actually an old monster? Xiao Tianfang thought to himself.</p>
<p>“Since he’s your Uncle-Master, do you think it’s appropriate for him to do something like this?” Xiao Liuqi said.</p>
<p>Worm Dugu continued smiling as he said, “It’s useless saying that to me. Only uncle-masters discipline their disciples. When have you seen a disciple manage an uncle-master?”</p>
<p>“Sir…” Xiao Liuqi looked at Zhou Wen and was about to say something when he suddenly saw Zhou Wen extend his hand and grab. A blood-red vortex appeared in his palm and sucked in the Ice Silkworm that was fighting the Blood Scorpion.</p>
<p>The majestic Ice Silkworm couldn’t withstand the suction force of the blood-colored vortex and was sucked into the Essence Gold Pot.</p>
<p>“How is that possible?” It wasn’t just the Xiao family. Even Worm Dugu widened his eyes as though he had seen a ghost.</p>
<p>Although he had thought that it was very likely that Zhou Wen would subdue the Ice Silkworm, he never expected him to use such a method.</p>
<p>Worm Dugu originally imagined that Zhou Wen would use the chick’s restraining effect before using various means and Mythical Companion Beasts to fight the Ice Silkworm to finally subdue it.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, Zhou Wen extended his hand and sucked the Ice Silkworm into the Essence Gold Pot as though he wasn’t taking in a Gu King but an ordinary worm.</p>
<p>The Xiao family members’ eyes nearly popped out. They had fought the Ice Silkworm for so long, so they naturally knew how terrifying it was.</p>
<p>Up to now, they had lost hundreds of Gu and Kuman Thong, but they were still helpless against the Ice Silkworm. Even the Mythical Blood Scorpion Gu had been about to be killed.</p>
<p>Yet, Zhou Wen had managed to capture the Ice Silkworm with one hand. How terrifying was this power? It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>As expected of Worm Dugu’s uncle-master. He’s indeed an old monster. Xiao Tianfang was secretly alarmed as his expression turned extremely ugly.</p>
<p>After spending so much effort and paying such a huge price, the Ice Silkworm was actually caught by someone else. Xiao Tianfang didn’t even need to guess to know that the other Ice Silkworm had definitely been taken by Worm Dugu’s uncle-master.</p>
<p>He wanted to snatch it, but Worm Dugu was already someone he didn’t have the guts to attack. Furthermore, the person in front of him was Worm Dugu’s uncle-master, an existence who had subdued the Ice Silkworm with one hand.</p>
<p>Only then did Xiao Tianfang feel a sinister aura return and enter the Kuman Nee in his hand.</p>
<p>“You came back too late.” Xiao Tianfang was somewhat exasperated.</p>
<p>“The Kuman Nee in your hand is rather interesting,” Zhou Wen said as he looked at the Kuman Nee in Xiao Tianfang’s hands.</p>
<p>The expressions of the Xiao family members changed. If an existence that could capture an Ice Silkworm with one hand wanted to snatch their Kuman Nee, they probably wouldn’t have a chance to resist.</p>
<p>Even a Mythical Kuman Nee wouldn’t be able to fight against such an existence.</p>
<p>“Old Master Dugu, the Dugu family is the head of the South District. You aren’t going to watch your uncle-master snatch our Kuman Nee, right?” Xiao Liuqi was nervous as he looked at Worm Dugu and said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>Before Worm Dugu could say a word, Zhou Wen said, “Who said I wanted to snatch something of yours? An old man like me just finds it a little special and asked casually. Even if I really wanted it, I wouldn’t snatch something from juniors like you. At most, I’ll buy your Kuman Nee. Why do I have to snatch it?”</p>
<p>“This Kuman Nee is our Xiao family’s heirloom. It’s not for sale,” Xiao Liuqi said.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you willing to sell it if I use the Ice Silkworm as an exchange?” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>“You want to exchange the Ice Silkworm for the Kuman Nee?” Xiao Tianfang and Xiao Liuqi were stunned.</p>
<p>“Why? Isn’t the Ice Silkworm enough? What about the two Ice Silkworms?” Zhou Wen continued.</p>
<p>“Old sir, are you really going to exchange two Ice Silkworms for a Kuman Nee?” Xiao Tianfang and Xiao Liuqi looked at each other and saw the pleasant surprise in each other’s eyes.</p>
<p>In their opinion, Kuman Nee was indeed very strong, but she was only slightly stronger than an Ice Silkworm. The two Ice Silkworms were much more pragmatic than the Gu Lady Kuman Nee.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Gu Lady Kuman Nee would bite her master. Xiao Tianfang would even consider exchanging her away for a single Ice Silkworm, much less two.</p>
<p>“Uncle-Master, you can’t do that.” Worm Dugu was shocked. Using two Ice Silkworms to exchange for Kuman Nee was a losing transaction.</p>
<p>However, what they didn’t know was that the two Ice Silkworms were far inferior to Gu Lady. They weren’t on the same level at all. Even if the exchange was really made, Zhou Wen would have the upper hand. Furthermore, he had no intention of really giving the Ice Silkworms to the Xiao family.</p>
<h3 id='chapter801'>Chapter 801: Exchange</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Do you really want to exchange the Ice Silkworm for my Kuman Nee?” Xiao Tianfang hurriedly asked, afraid that Zhou Wen would be persuaded otherwise by Worm Dugu.</p>
<p>“That depends on whether your Kuman Nee can interest me. She looks a little special to me, different from the Kuman Nee I’ve seen before. Tell me what’s so special about her.” Zhou Wen firstly wanted to bait Xiao Tianfang into the scam, and secondly, he wanted to know more about the Kuman Nee.</p>
<p>“This…” Xiao Tianfang was somewhat hesitant. After all, he wasn’t sure if Zhou Wen would use two Ice Silkworms to exchange for Kuman Nee. If he explained Kuman Nee’s origins and Zhou Wen didn’t make the exchange, he would suffer a great loss.</p>
<p>“Uncle-Master, if you want a Kuman Nee, our Dugu family has plenty. How about this? Come back with me. You can exchange the Ice Silkworms with our Dugu family. We can offer to exchange two Ice Silkworms for two Kuman Nee. Whatever species you want, you can choose all the Kuman Thong in the Dugu family,” said Worm Dugu.</p>
<p>“Tianfang.” Xiao Liuqi was a little anxious as he looked at Xiao Tianfang.</p>
<p>Xiao Tianfang gritted his teeth and said to Zhou Wen, “I don’t dare say that my Kuman Nee is unprecedented, but she’s indeed extraordinary. She can be said to be unique. You won’t find another one in all of the Federation. If you really want it, can we have a private chat?”</p>
<p>“There aren’t any outsiders here. Is there anything you can’t say out loud?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Xiao Tianfang said, “You won’t necessarily exchange for my Kuman Nee. Even if you do the exchange, you wouldn’t want outsiders to know her secret, right?”</p>
<p>“That makes sense. Alright then.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.</p>
<p>“Uncle-Master, that Kuman Nee really isn’t worth two Ice Silkworms. Why don’t you exchange it with me? Our Dugu family has all kinds of Kuman Nee, so why do we have to go so far to get one?” Worm Dugu had the urge to hold Zhou Wen back.</p>
<p>“Cut it out. I’ve seen all those Kuman Nee at your place. I’m sick of them. They are nothing interesting. I think this Kuman Nee is a little different,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You really have good taste. This way, please.” Xiao Tianfang made an inviting gesture.</p>
<p>“Wait for me here. I’ll be back after taking a look,” Zhou Wen said to Li Xuan and Worm Dugu before following Xiao Tianfang to the temporary camp they had set up in a nearby cave.</p>
<p>Xiao Tianfang and Xiao Liuqi saw that Zhou Wen seemed totally unfazed along the way, as though he didn’t care if they had set up an ambush. This made them feel that Zhou Wen was definitely very terrifying.</p>
<p>“How may I address you?” When they reached the cave, Xiao Tianfang got Xiao Liuqi to personally guard the door while he conversed with Zhou Wen alone.</p>
<p>“My surname is Zhou,” Zhou Wen said casually.</p>
<p>“Elder Zhou, you must be an expert at Kuman Thong. You must know a lot about this. You know that some Kuman Thong and Kuman Nee have very special refinement methods…” Xiao Tianfang probed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen waved his hand and said disapprovingly, “I don’t care how this Kuman Nee came about. I just want to know what’s so special about her. I only want something unique. If it’s not unique, it’s meaningless.”</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhou Wen didn’t mind the method of refining the Kuman Nee, Xiao Tianfang said with a smile, “Elder Zhou, you are indeed an expert. Your insight isn’t something an ordinary person can compare with. My Kuman Nee was refined by a Buddhist master. The abilities this Kuman Nee has are also different from ordinary Kuman Nee. She doesn’t have ordinary abilities like luck enhancement, but she has a way of dealing with Gu. She can capture Mythical Gu independently.”</p>
<p>“Is that all?” Zhou Wen revealed a look of disappointment.</p>
<p>Xiao Tianfang gritted his teeth and continued, “To be honest, the baby used to refine the Kuman Nee is the reincarnation of the legendary Gu God. It has a natural restraining effect on Gu. Our Xiao family was too incompetent and couldn’t nurture her well. If an expert like you were to nurture her, you might be able to unleash her full strength. When that happens, she will definitely be of great use.”</p>
<p>“The reincarnation of a Gu God? That’s interesting. I heard that there’s a couple who reared Gu and their child was the reincarnation of a Gu God. Are these two matters related?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Well…” Xiao Tianfang neither admitted nor denied.</p>
<p>“I’ve only heard of that matter as well. I originally wanted to rush over to see if I could refine a Kuman Nee, but I was a step too late. If this Kuman Nee’s material was that fetus, I’ll do the exchange,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You’re really a kindred spirit. Do you really want to do the exchange? Two Ice Silkworms for this Kuman Nee?” Xiao Tianfang was still worried and wanted to make another confirmation.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, this Kuman Nee was really refined by that baby. It’s no wonder you are so careful.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he placed the Essence Gold Pot on the stone platform and pushed it in front of Xiao Tianfang. “If it’s really refined from that fetus, I want it. You can have the Ice Silkworms.”</p>
<p>“Do you mind if I take a look at the Ice Silkworms inside? It’s not that I don’t believe you, but this concerns the future of our Xiao family…” Xiao Tianfang asked carefully. At this stage, he was still very careful.</p>
<p>“Just open it. My Essence Gold Pot is extraordinary. As long as I trap a Gu, even a Dragon King Gu won’t be able to escape,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>When Xiao Tianfang heard that the Essence Gold Pot was so powerful, he picked it up and observed it carefully. He felt that it was indeed a good pot, but he didn’t know what was good about it.</p>
<p>The Xiao family only started raising Gu recently and they weren’t as proficient as nurturing Kuman Thong. How could he recognize a Gu pot made by Worm Dugu?</p>
<p>Xiao Tianfang didn’t dare open it for fear that the Ice Silkworm would escape. He wasn’t confident of escaping in front of two Ice Silkworms.</p>
<p>However, on second thought, Kuman Nee was connected to his life, so it was impossible for Zhou Wen to harm him if he wanted her.</p>
<p>When Xiao Tianfang thought of this, he carefully opened a sliver of the Gu pot. Through the crack, he saw the two Ice Silkworms inside, but they were restrained by the Essence Gold Pot. No matter how hard they struggled, they couldn’t rush out.</p>
<p>Xiao Tianfang was relieved. He opened the lid completely and the two Ice Silkworms inside only circled around the pot, unable to crawl out.</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect such a Gu pot to exist in this world. My horizons have really been broadened today.” Xiao Tianfang thought for a moment and said, “Since you are so sincere, I won’t hide it from you. This Kuman Nee of mine was refined from that fetus. It has a very strong restraining effect on Gu worms. It is also an extremely powerful existence among Kuman Nee. It can be considered a fusion between Gu and Kuman Nee. It is a unique existence in this world. You definitely wouldn’t regret the exchange.”</p>
<p>“As expected. I knew I wouldn’t be wrong. In that case, the two Ice Silkworms are yours. Remove her Intrinsic Lock and give her to me,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Xiao Tianfang said in embarrassment, “Elder Zhou, your pot is amazing, but our Xiao family can’t compare to you. Without a pot that can store the Ice Silkworms, we aren’t able to take them back. We originally wanted this Kuman Nee to control them, but now that Kuman Nee is to be transferred to you, there’s really no other way. Can you lend us the Gu pot for a while? Once it’s successfully tamed, we’ll definitely return it immediately.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter802'>Chapter 802: Growing Flesh</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, This Xiao Tianfang sure is greedy. He’s already eyeing the Gu pot.</p>
<p>However, this was exactly what Zhou Wen wanted. Zhou Wen said indifferently, “It’s just a Gu pot. I have plenty of them. It’s nothing. Just take it back. There’s no need to return it.”</p>
<p>“Elder Zhou, are you serious?” Xiao Tianfang was overjoyed. He even had the urge to kneel and kowtow to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“The premise is that your Kuman Nee is really the reincarnation of the Gu God. If I discover anything amiss, I’m afraid your Xiao family won’t be able to remain safe, much less continue possessing the Ice Silkworms and Gu pot,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>Xiao Tianfang was alarmed. The joy in his heart subsided a little as he said solemnly, “Don’t worry. This Kuman Nee is definitely refined from the Gu God’s reincarnation. Furthermore, it was personally refined by me. There’s no mistake. If I lied, I’m willing to have ten thousand Gu drill through my heart.”</p>
<p>Xiao Tianfang swore and told the truth.</p>
<p>“Then I’m relieved. Unlock her Intrinsic Lock,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Do I do it directly? Do you want me to transfer the Intrinsic Lock directly to you?” Xiao Tianfang asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. If I can’t even suppress a Mythical Kuman Nee, I would have wasted all my years studying Kuman Thong,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Xiao Tianfang felt that Zhou Wen was indeed a big shot. He didn’t even think much of the Mythical Kuman Nee. It was no wonder he could be Worm Dugu’s uncle-master.</p>
<p>Thinking of how Zhou Wen could easily subdue the Ice Silkworm Gu Kings, he didn’t hesitate any further.</p>
<p>He handed the Kuman Nee to Zhou Wen and took out a pouch. Holding it, he bit his tongue and spat out a mouthful of blood onto it.</p>
<p>The moment his blood touched the pouch, the pouch burst into flames. As the pouch was destroyed, the Kuman Nee in Zhou Wen’s hand trembled.</p>
<p>Xiao Tianfang’s expression turned nasty as well. His face was pale as cold sweat instantly covered his forehead. He looked to be in extreme pain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had consulted Gu Shanshui and knew that this Intrinsic Lock connected Kuman Nee to his life. If it was removed, it would also cause great damage to him.</p>
<p>Xiao Tianfang was willing to release the Intrinsic Lock likely because he was unable to completely control Gu Lady. Instead, he had suffered a backlash from Gu Lady’s power. He had been tormented over the years.</p>
<p>Now that he could finally be liberated of Gu Lady, he was even more eager than Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>With the two Ice Silkworm Gu Kings and the Gu pot, the Xiao family’s future would definitely be better than before. The pain of Gu Lady’s backlash would also be a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>After the pouch was completely burned, something on Kuman Nee’s skull seemed to shatter. Zhou Wen took a look and saw a drop of blood seeping out from the top of the skull.</p>
<p>Xiao Tianfang let out a cry and spat out a mouthful of blood. It looked like his injuries weren’t light.</p>
<p>“Elder Zhou, quickly suppress Kuman Nee. Don’t let her escape,” Xiao Tianfang said as he endured the pain.</p>
<p>He wasn’t afraid that Gu Lady would escape. After all, he had already sold her to Zhou Wen. It didn’t matter if she ran or not. He was just afraid that she would find trouble with him.</p>
<p>“The deal is closed. It’s time for me to leave.” Zhou Wen grabbed the Kuman Nee and injected a stream of Essence Energy into her. Kuman Nee was immediately enveloped by Essence Energy before he placed her in the bag and stood up.</p>
<p>“Someone, take Elder Zhou back.” Xiao Tianfang called for someone and said, “Elder Zhou, take care. I’m not feeling well, so I won’t be sending you off.”</p>
<p>“Recuperate well. You are quite injured after breaking the Intrinsic Lock.” With that said, Zhou Wen left with the Kuman Nee.</p>
<p>Xiao Liuqi came over and asked nervously and excitedly, “Tianfang, did we really close the deal? Did we really exchange for the two Ice Silkworm Gu Kings?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s those two Ice Silkworm Gu Kings without a doubt. There’s still the mark we left on them. There’s no mistake.” Xiao Tianfang was also very excited. “That Elder Zhou doesn’t know that there’s something wrong with Gu Lady and thinks that he got the better deal. Now that we have two Ice Silkworm Gu Kings, and I’ve removed the backlash from my body, the two of us will each have one Ice Silkworm Gu King. In two to three years, after we tame them, our Xiao family will have a chance to advance further. By the way, look at this Gu pot. It’s an amazing Gu pot.”</p>
<p>Xiao Tianfang opened the Gu pot and showed Xiao Liuqi see the Ice Silkworms. He even demonstrated the functions of the Gu pot.</p>
<p>“Elder Zhou casually gave us such a treasure. What a fool,” Xiao Liuqi sighed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already walked far away, but Truth Listener still allowed him to hear the conversation between the two brothers clearly. He couldn’t help but sneer inwardly. I wonder who’s the fool.</p>
<p>Gu Lady could easily make the Ice Silkworms obey her orders, making her a truly terrifying existence. The Xiao brothers didn’t know the precious treasure they had and imagined that they got the better deal from exchanging two Ice Silkworm Gu Kings.</p>
<p>As for the so-called treasure Gu pot, although it was indeed extraordinary, it was impossible to restrain the Ice Silkworm Gu Kings.</p>
<p>The reason they obediently remained inside was that Gu Lady was making them cooperate. Otherwise, they would have long rushed out.</p>
<p>The Xiao brothers treated them as treasures, but they didn’t know that they would be taking their lives.</p>
<p>After Gu Lady obtained freedom, she wanted to attack the Xiao brothers, but Zhou Wen held her Kuman Nee down, preventing her from taking revenge.</p>
<p>After all, Zhou Wen was trading with the Xiao brothers in the name of the Dugu family. If he killed them now, it wouldn’t be good for the Dugu family’s reputation.</p>
<p>Worm Dugu had already helped him in the act, so he didn’t want to implicate the Dugu family.</p>
<p>“There’s no rush. You are already free. There are still two Ice Silkworm Gu Kings by their side. Are you still afraid of not getting your revenge?” Zhou Wen touched the agitated Kuman Nee in his backpack and whispered.</p>
<p>The Kuman Nee slowly calmed down. After the Intrinsic Lock was removed, Gu Lady entered the Kuman Nee.</p>
<p>Previously, due to the restriction of the Intrinsic Lock, she couldn’t even return to her body. She could only listen to Xiao Tianfang’s orders and work for him. Otherwise, Xiao Tianfang could easily have killed her.</p>
<p>However, it was different now. The Intrinsic Lock was removed and Gu Lady was no longer restricted.</p>
<p>After meeting up with Li Xuan and Worm Dugu, the trio returned to their residence.</p>
<p>On the way back, Worm Dugu asked with a smile, “Uncle-Master, my acting isn’t bad, right?”</p>
<p>“Not bad. It’s just a little exaggerated,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Only exaggerated acting can be acknowledged by others. Didn’t Xiao Tianfang end up believing it? On account of my age and how hard I’ve worked to participate in your act, shouldn’t you consider teaching me a few tricks on how to adopt a phoenix?” Worm Dugu said.</p>
<p>“The trick is to find a phoenix and be fancied by it.” Zhou Wen was speaking the truth, but his honest words left Worm Dugu depressed.</p>
<p>On the way back, Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss with the Kuman Nee. The jade-like bones were slowly growing. Not only was the bone expanding, but there were also flesh and blood vessels growing on it.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Could she have come back to life? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly stored her into the chaos space. Otherwise, it would be too shocking if others saw her.</p>
<h3 id='chapter803'>Chapter 803: Ya’er</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The crystal container outside the Kuman Nee shattered and the Corpse Oil inside flowed out.</p>
<p>Kuman Nee was already too big for a container. Her flesh was full, and her skin grew out. This was followed by her hair and nails.</p>
<p>In just a moment, the originally shrunken and blurry Kuman Nee became a healthy-looking baby.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>The fair and tender baby looked no different from a normal baby, but upon careful inspection of her body, one would discover that her heart wasn’t beating, and the blood in her body wasn’t circulating.</p>
<p>She could be said to be dead, but everything about her was normal. There was life in her body, and even her eyes were open. She was like a normal baby, but she didn’t even have a heart. It was difficult to understand if she was dead or alive.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen returned to his residence, the baby had already grown to the size of a one-year-old toddler. However, it looked like it had stopped growing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that it would grow to the size of Gu Lady, but to his surprise, it stopped growing.</p>
<p>Could it be that she was affected by the chaos space when I placed her inside? Zhou Wen took the girl out and bathed her. He washed the Corpse Oil off her body and placed her on the bed.</p>
<p>However, the female toddler didn’t continue growing. She remained as big as before as she sat on the bed and looked at Zhou Wen expressionlessly.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took out a set of clothes he had bought for Demonic Neonate from the chaos space. He had originally planned on letting Demonic Neonate wear them when she had nothing to do for fun, but now, they came in handy.</p>
<p>However, she was slightly smaller than Demonic Neonate, so the clothes would be oversized when she put them on. However, these were the most suitable clothes Zhou Wen could find for her. She would have to make do with them and wait till he bought more for her in the future.</p>
<p>“Do you know how to put clothes on?” Zhou Wen asked the girl.</p>
<p>The girl shook her head and continued looking at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Could it be that she has become a child, and even her intelligence has regressed? Zhou Wen had no choice but to help her put them on. Then, he looked at the girl sitting on the bed and asked, “Do you still remember me?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what was happening. The knowledge he learned from Gu Shanshui didn’t include this.</p>
<p>According to Gu Shanshui, if there were no restrictions, the spirit body could return to its original body, but it wouldn’t revive. It only had autonomy.</p>
<p>Typically, Kuman Nee, who had autonomy, were very dangerous. As they died unjustly, their resentment wouldn’t dissipate, and they would constantly harm others.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wish to rear Gu Lady like Xiao Tianfang, so he didn’t plan on turning her into his Kuman Nee. Instead, he planned on using another method to take her away.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, before Zhou Wen used that method, Gu Lady came alive and turned into a baby. The method Gu Shanshui had taught him was probably useless.</p>
<p>The girl nodded. It looked like she still remembered him.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, you still have your memories.” Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief. It was easy if she still had her memories.</p>
<p>“Now that you are free, what plans do you have?” Zhou Wen asked the girl.</p>
<p>The girl looked at Zhou Wen without answering, as though she didn’t know what he meant.</p>
<p>“I mean, where do you want to go in the future?” Zhou Wen was afraid that she wouldn’t understand, so he changed his phrasing.</p>
<p>The girl continued looking at him without saying a word. It was unknown if she understood him.</p>
<p>“Well… What’s your name?” Zhou Wen wanted to call her by name, but he realized that he definitely didn’t know her name. He couldn’t call her Gu Lady like Xiao Tianfang, right? She probably wouldn’t like that form of address.</p>
<p>The girl finally reacted and shook her head at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“You don’t have a name?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Seeing the girl nod, Zhou Wen knew that he had guessed correctly. After some thought, he said, “Shall I give you a name then?”</p>
<p>The girl nodded again. This made Zhou Wen know that she could understand him. Her intelligence didn’t regress, but for some reason, she couldn’t speak.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen seriously considered for a while before sizing up the girl. Then, he carefully asked, “What do you think of the name Xiaoli?”</p>
<p>The girl remained expressionless, but she subtly turned her face away.</p>
<p>“Don’t like it? How about Xiaona?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.</p>
<p>The girl was expressionless as though she hadn’t heard Zhou Wen. She raised her arm and pointed at Zhou Wen’s chest.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked down and realized that there was nothing but clothes on his chest. There were no patterns or words.</p>
<p>Could it be… She’s referring to this… Zhou Wen reached into his collar and took out a pendant akin to ivory.</p>
<p>This was a pendant carved by Wang Mingyuan. It was said to be carved from the tooth of the White Dragon in Old Dragon’s Well. As for the origins of the dragon’s tooth, it was said that Eldest Senior Brother Liu Yun had stolen it from Old Dragon’s Well. However, Wang Mingyuan said that he had picked it up himself.</p>
<p>She can still see through things. From the looks of it, she still has her powers. Zhou Wen knew that he had guessed correctly when he saw the girl’s finger track the pendant as he moved it.</p>
<p>“You want to use this pendant as a name? Got it. It’s carved from a dragon’s tooth, so you want to be called Xiaolong, right?” Zhou Wen was enlightened.</p>
<p>The girl was expressionless as she stared at him without any reaction. After staring at him for quite some time without blinking, Zhou Wen felt a little creeped out.</p>
<p>“That’s not it? What about Xiaoya?” Zhou Wen asked guiltily.</p>
<p>The girl looked at Zhou Wen with a strange look before slowly nodding.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the girl’s eyes and felt that she was about to give up. He also didn’t feel too good about it, so he thought for a moment and said, “Xiaoya doesn’t sound nice. It doesn’t sound like a girl’s name. Why don’t we call you Ya’er? This ‘ya’ means sprouting. I hope you can grow up quickly.”</p>
<p>The girl nodded slightly. Although it was still a little forced, she didn’t have the look of giving up like before.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll call you Ya’er from now on.” Zhou Wen wiped the sweat off his forehead and looked at Ya’er. “Ya’er, can you still control the Ice Silkworm Gu Kings?”</p>
<p>Ya’er nodded and Zhou Wen felt relieved. If Ya’er couldn’t control the Ice Silkworm Gu Kings, his plan would fail. Although the outcome might still be the same, Zhou Wen didn’t like things that he couldn’t control.</p>
<p>“Can you still make others not see you?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>This time, Ya’er shook her head. Clearly, she could no longer exist in her spirit body state.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen asked some more questions and roughly gained an understanding of Ya’er, but what he knew remained limited. She couldn’t speak, so Zhou Wen could only probe.</p>
<p>Now, he only knew that Ya’er’s ability, memory, and intelligence hadn’t changed. It was the same as before, but for some reason, her body had stopped growing.</p>
<p>Is she considered a living person now? Zhou Wen couldn’t determine Ya’er’s situation, so he could only ask her, “What do you want to do now?”</p>
<p>“Kill.” Ya’er actually said one word.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“So you can speak?” Zhou Wen looked at Ya’er in shock. He had been gesturing for so long, but it turned out that Ya’er could speak.</p>
<h3 id='chapter804'>Chapter 804: Annihilation</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen asked her again, she only nodded and shook her head without saying another word.</p>
<p>Could it be that she only knows one word? Although Zhou Wen felt that it was unlikely and there was no reason for her to only say one word, there was nothing he could do if Ya’er didn’t wish to speak.</p>
<p>Ya’er suddenly stood up and walked out. However, after taking two steps, her legs went limp and she fell to the ground. From the looks of it, her body’s strength was about the same as an ordinary toddler’s.</p>
<p>Ya’er frowned slightly as her eyes narrowed, causing her body to levitate.</p>
<p>How strange. Her mental strength is still as strong as before. It’s at the Mythical level, but her body is as weak as a baby. Zhou Wen found it odd.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something to her, he saw her fly out the window and head for the Xiao family.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was afraid that something would happen, so he put on the Invisibility Cloak and followed.</p>
<p>Inside the Xiao family, Xiao Tianfang and Xiao Liuqi were preparing to tame the Ice Silkworms. They couldn’t wait to tame them successfully.</p>
<p>“What a treasure. A powerful Gu like the Ice Silkworm Gu King is actually trapped inside without the ability to rush out. It’s much easier for us to tame them,” Xiao Liuqi said as he looked at the Ice Silkworms inside.</p>
<p>Xiao Tianfang was also observing the two Ice Silkworms. The two Ice Silkworms seemed to be tired from crawling around inside. They were motionless inside, probably resting.</p>
<p>Xiao Liuqi took out a Gu and tied it to a rope before throwing it into the Essence Gold Pot. This was food that Ice Silkworms liked to eat. He had to use this method to entice the Ice Silkworms, but he wouldn’t let them eat it. Then, he would gradually train them.</p>
<p>Xiao Liuqi placed the Gu inside and was about to pull the Gu out when the Ice Silkworm took action. However, to his surprise, an Ice Silkworm swallowed the Gu. Its speed was shockingly fast, giving him no time to pull out the Gu.</p>
<p>“The Ice Silkworms are too fast. I doubt it will be easy taming them.” Xiao Liuqi was just about to pull out the rope and get another Gu when the Ice Silkworm inside the pot phased away suddenly, appearing on the edge of the pot.</p>
<p>Alarmed, Xiao Liuqi and Xiao Tianfang quickly retreated.</p>
<p>“How did that happen?” Xiao Tianfang was alarmed. He felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Before Xiao Liuqi could say anything, another Ice Silkworm crawled out as though the Essence Gold Pot had lost its effect.</p>
<p>The two of them ran out without any hesitation. After they left the secret chamber, they were stunned by the scene in front of them.</p>
<p>In the huge temple, there were all sorts of Gu crawling everywhere. The Xiao family members were fighting with their Gu. What was even more terrifying was that the Gu they had domesticated now betrayed their masters and attacked them. There were screams and blood splattering everywhere.</p>
<p>“How did this happen? What happened?” Xiao Tianfang’s eyes turned red. The entire temple seemed to have turned into hell.</p>
<p>“There’s a problem. There must be a problem. It must be that Zhou guy. He didn’t want to give us the Ice Silkworms at all…” Xiao Liuqi felt despair. The Xiao family already had many Gu. Now, all of them had betrayed them. Even the Mythical-level Blood Scorpion Gu had rushed out and was engaging in wanton slaughter.</p>
<p>There were also a few Mythical Gu they had previously captured that were doing the same.</p>
<p>Any one of them was already very difficult to deal with, much less with so many Gu. It was already impossible for them to rush out of the temple.</p>
<p>“Zhou, even if I become a ghost after death, I won’t let you off,” Xiao Tianfang shouted in grief and indignation.</p>
<p>In the sky, a figure slowly descended. Xiao Tianfang and Xiao Liuqi looked over and realized that it was a one-year-old girl.</p>
<p>However, the girl’s face didn’t have the innocence and cuteness a child should have. She was completely expressionless other than her cold expression. She floated in the air and looked down coldly at Xiao Tianfang and Xiao Liuqi.</p>
<p>The surrounding Gu killed wantonly, but no Gu attacked Xiao Tianfang and Xiao Liuqi.</p>
<p>Xiao Tianfang carefully sized up Ya’er and suddenly pointed at her as he shouted in horror, “Gu Lady… You’re Gu Lady… How is this possible…”</p>
<p>After all, he had once been connected to Ya’er at an intrinsic level. He was all too familiar with her aura. Although the Intrinsic Lock had been removed, he could still sense the unique aura from Ya’er.</p>
<p>“How can she be Gu Lady? That’s impossible, right?” Xiao Liuqi naturally didn’t believe that the girl in front of him was Gu Lady.</p>
<p>Kuman Nee couldn’t be revived. The little girl in front of them was clearly a living person.</p>
<p>“Liuqi, are you silly? Apart from Gu Lady, who else can control so many Gu? Who can make all our Gu betray us? Also, the aura from her is definitely Gu Lady…” Xiao Tianfang said in horror.</p>
<p>At that moment, the two Ice Silkworms crawled out as transparent wings grew from their backs. They flew to the side of Gu Lady as though they were protecting her.</p>
<p>Xiao Tianfang suddenly seemed to understand something as his body trembled. He gritted his teeth and said, “I get it. I get it now. So that Zhou fellow isn’t capable at all. The treasure pot and the ease at subduing the Ice Silkworms were all fake. Gu Lady was able to subdue the Ice Silkworms. She was the one controlling the Ice Silkworms… We actually didn’t realize that her strength had already reached such a level…”</p>
<p>Xiao Liuqi was also horrified. His face was filled with despair. “It’s over, Tianfang. We’re doomed this time… We shouldn’t have targeted her back then… Now, she’s here for revenge…”</p>
<p>Everyone in the Xiao family was dead. Gu swarmed over like a tidal wave, surrounding the two of them in the middle. The entire temple was drowned by Gu, leaving only the spot where they stood without any Gu.</p>
<p>“You… deserve death…” With her voice, the tidal-like Gu rushed towards them.</p>
<p>The Xiao brothers fought with all their might, but they were quickly drowned by Gu. Countless Gu drilled into their bodies and tore at their organs and flesh.</p>
<p>Amidst the inhuman screams, the Xiao brothers were eaten until there was nothing left.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen remained in midair and couldn’t help but frown when he saw the Xiao family’s tragic state. He was also somewhat worried.</p>
<p>It was understandable that Ya’er wanted revenge, but it was indeed a little too ruthless to kill everyone without any discrimination. It wasn’t necessarily true that everyone in the Xiao family was bad, and not everyone had done evil.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t pity the Xiao family, but he was afraid of Ya’er’s character. If he kept her by his side in the future, if he or the people around him angered her one day, would she treat him and his friends the same way she treated the Xiao family?</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was still pondering over it, the Gu began to disperse. Moments later, not a single one was left. Only Ya’er flew over with two Ice Silkworms.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took out the Essence Gold Pot that Worm Dugu had given him and the two Ice Silkworms obediently crawled in.</p>

<p>“Now that you’re free, you can go anywhere you want to go or do whatever you want,” Zhou Wen said to Ya’er.</p>
<p>However, Ya’er just looked at Zhou Wen without saying a word. She clearly knew how to speak, but for some reason, she didn’t say a word.</p>
<p>“Do you have anywhere you want to go or anything you want to do?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>Ya’er shook her head slightly. She had been refined into a Kuman Nee by the Xiao brothers before she was even born. She probably didn’t know where she wanted to go or what she wanted.</p>
<p>“Then follow me. However, if you follow me, I have a few requests. If you can do it, you can follow me. If you can’t, you should head off by yourself,” Zhou Wen said to Ya’er.</p>
<p>Ya’er didn’t say a word as she looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Firstly, you are to follow my orders. Without my orders, you are not to injure others. Secondly, you are not to use Gu to harm others without my permission. Thirdly, you can reason with me, but you have to listen to me in the end. Fourthly, don’t casually show your strength in front of others… Can you do it?” Zhou Wen asked Ya’er.</p>
<p>Ya’er looked at Zhou Wen and nodded without any hesitation. He did not know if she had really understood.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt odd seeing Ya’er nod. Although he was somewhat happy, he was also somewhat worried.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if Ya’er could be considered a human. If she still had the taboos of a Kuman Nee, she would probably spell trouble in the future.</p>
<p>However, at this point, Zhou Wen had no choice but to take her back.</p>
<p>He brought Ya’er along to buy some clothes. Although she didn’t say a word, she was very obedient. She did whatever Zhou Wen said. She looked like an ordinary, obedient child. She didn’t show any of the ruthlessness she had when destroying the Xiao family at all.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, where did you abduct this child?” Li Xuan asked in surprise when he saw Zhou Wen return with a child.</p>
<p>“I picked her up on the way,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“Could she be lost?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“No, I went to a dimensional zone where Gu appear. No one will take a child there,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Who’s so heartless to abandon such a cute little girl?” Li Xuan looked at the girl with pity.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but I plan on adopting her and bringing her with me.” Zhou Wen took out the Gu pot and handed it to Li Xuan. “The two Ice Silkworms are inside.”</p>
<p>“How’s the Xiao family?” Li Xuan asked with an odd expression as he held the Gu pot.</p>
<p>“It was destroyed by the Kuman Nee.” Zhou Wen didn’t elaborate because the scene was too tragic.</p>
<p>“They deserved it. How were they unafraid of the wrath of heaven to actually kill someone and dig out the baby?” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Does this child have a name?” Li Xuan asked as he stroked her head.</p>
<p>“Ya’er, a name I gave her.” Zhou Wen felt relieved when he saw Ya’er not exhibiting any special reactions towards Li Xuan’s stroking of her head.</p>
<p>“What kind of name is this? How can such a cute little girl use such a name? You should at least call her Crescent or something. Even the common Xiaoya is way better than Ya’er, right? No, no, you have to give her a new name.” Li Xuan immediately shook his head when he heard Ya’er’s name.</p>
<p>“Let’s talk about it when I register her in the future. Let’s just treat Ya’er as a nickname.” Zhou Wen really didn’t know how to give names. It gave him a headache.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Soon, the Xiao family’s overnight destruction was discovered. Many people went to take a look and realized that there were traces of a large number of Gu. They guessed that the Xiao family had been destroyed by Gu, but no one knew the exact details.</p>
<p>The number one Xiao family in Chiang Rai was destroyed overnight. This became a legend in Chiang Rai. There were all kinds of stories.</p>
<p>Li Xuan planned on visiting the Dugu family with Worm Dugu to learn about Gu, but Zhou Wen stayed behind. As there was still no concrete news from Primordial Spore, he wanted to wait and see.</p>
<p>The Primordial Spore hadn’t successfully parasitized the dragon, but it hadn’t died either. Zhou Wen didn’t know what was happening.</p>
<p>Li Mobai also returned to Luoyang with Butterfly and Mute. Gu Shanshui even called and said that he had found a way to trap the Corpse Bug and wanted Zhou Wen to retrieve the calabash.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was temporarily unable to head to Mong Hsat, so Gu Shanshui got Gu Lou to deliver the calabash to him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen waited for news of the Primordial Spore while grinding.</p>
<p>Ancient Sword Tomb and Valley of No Return were excellent dungeons that produced many good items. Zhou Wen focused on grinding these two dungeons. Together with the Mythical creatures and rare creatures in other dungeons, he had to grind them all every time he respawned.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen went to the snow valley on the right side of the Valley of No Return a few times, but the blood-colored avatar would quickly die every time he entered. It was fine flying in the air, but when he was in the air, he could only see the snow-covered valley with no Gu to be seen.</p>
<p>Up to now, Zhou Wen still didn’t understand why the blood-colored avatar would die in the snow.</p>
<p>With Truth Listener and Supreme Hell King’s abilities, if a Gu is hidden in the snow, I should be able to sense it no matter how tiny it is. Furthermore, there’s no reaction from the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. This means that it’s not a taboo power. What killed the blood-colored avatar? Zhou Wen studied it for a while but failed to find the secret of the snow valley.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen guessed that most of the people who entered the Valley of No Return had died in the snow valley.</p>
<p>After all, those who dared to go there were experts at nurturing Gu. Many would have the means to deal with the Gu in the first few areas of the valley. However, the snow valley was not something that could be simply dealt with using Gu knowledge.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was gaming, Ya’er sat on the stool and watched him. She didn’t make a fuss.</p>
<p>Although Ya’er didn’t have a heartbeat, she wasn’t much different from a normal child. She also needed to eat to grow. Zhou Wen could sense that she was slowly growing at a speed similar to a normal child.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In a world that resembled a mystic realm, there was a huge palace that stood at the peak of a mountain. At the top of the palace was a huge statue that looked like a snake or a dragon, but it wasn’t either of them.</p>
<p>On the mountain that resembled a heavenly pillar, there was only a stone staircase that led up the mountain. It extended from the foot of the mountain all the way to the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>At that moment, a white-robed man with lightning bolts running through his body walked to the stone steps.</p>
<p>“Wang Mingyuan, you’re not guarding the divine tree and have actually dared to leave without permission. You’ve even come to Dragon God Mountain. Don’t you know that this is the place where the Dragon Gods live? It’s not a place a mixed-breed like you can come. Are you tired of living?” A monster with a human torso and a snake tail blocked Wang Mingyuan’s path.</p>
<p>“From now on, I’m the king of the Dragon Gods,” Wang Mingyuan said calmly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter806'>Chapter 806: Calamity Grade</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The snake-tailed monster guarding the stone steps appeared to have heard the funniest joke in the world. It laughed to the point of having tears stream down its face.</p>
<p>“You really think too highly of yourself. Don’t tell me you really think that advancing to the Mythical stage is that impressive? In the dimensional wars, the so-called Mythical stage of you humans is just cannon fodder. This is because only by reaching that level can one cross dimensions without being killed by the barriers of the different dimensions. Only ancient forbidden zones like Earth will treat the Mythical stage as something important.”</p>
<p>The monster continued contemptuously, “Just like how humans on Earth can’t survive in space because it doesn’t have the oxygen and other conditions you need to survive there. Becoming a Mythical stage merely means that you humans have learned how to survive in an environment without oxygen.”</p>
<p>“There’s naturally hope if one can learn to breathe and end up surviving,” Wang Mingyuan said.</p>
<p>“You need hope only for the impossible. There’s no way you can fathom what kind of existence the Dragon King is. If an ant like you hadn’t come out of the ancient forbidden land, you wouldn’t even be qualified to be a servant for the Dragon Gods, much less guard the divine tree. Yet, you actually dare to challenge the Dragon King? You’re tempting fate. There’s no need to look for the Dragon King. I’ll show you what true strength is today,” the monster said as a strange power arose from its body. It struck out at Wang Mingyuan with its hand.</p>
<p>The terrifying power transformed into a giant snake that tore towards Wang Mingyuan in a bid to devour him. This casual strike was so powerful that it could match Tyrant Behemoth in its Absolute Strength state.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan continued walking towards the stone steps, ignoring the terrifying snake attack.</p>
<p>However, when the giant snake came in front of him, it automatically disintegrated and turned into nothingness in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>“You actually broke through the dimensional barrier? However, do you think that you have the right to fight our Dragon Gods? Aren’t you being too arrogant?” Although the monster was arrogant, its expression turned solemn. It no longer wore a supercilious look.</p>
<p>Seeing Wang Mingyuan walk over step by step, the monster clasped its hands together and presented a strange offensive stance, like a venomous snake that could devour its enemy at any moment.</p>
<p>“I’ll show you the true power of us Dragon Gods… Dragon God Descent…” As the monster roared, the strange power on its body was pushed to its limits. A terrifying power immediately swept through the entire space. Giant snakes of light shot out with apocalyptic might, bombarding Wang Mingyuan from all directions.</p>
<p>Countless giant snakes tried to devour Wang Mingyuan, but when they reached him, they automatically disintegrated. They couldn’t touch his body at all as though his body was protected by a deity.</p>
<p>“How… How is this possible…” The monster was alarmed when it saw that its Dragon God Descent, which had been unleashed to its limits, failed to touch Wang Mingyuan’s clothes.</p>
<p>As for Wang Mingyuan, he was less than three meters away from him. The stone steps leading up the mountain were already right in front of him.</p>
<p>“Dragons aren’t like that.” Wang Mingyuan glanced at the monster and waved his hand gently. The monster’s body seemed to be grabbed by an invisible hand as it was thrown.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Its body slammed into the stone wall, creating a crater. Its bones seemed to have shattered and its body was covered in blood. It struggled a few times but failed to stand up. It only spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>
<p>“You advanced to the Calamity grade?” The monster looked at Wang Mingyuan in horror as though it had seen a ghost.</p>
<p>It hadn’t been long since Wang Mingyuan advanced to the Mythical stage and used the powers of the six Holy Temples to break through the dimensional barrier and enter the dimensional zone. He had even suffered the punishment of lightning smiting. Yet, he had advanced to the Calamity grade so quickly. This was just too shocking.</p>
<p>Even among the Octokind, which were born Mythical, there was only a handful who could advance to the Calamity grade so quickly.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan didn’t answer as he stepped onto the stone steps and walked towards the Dragon God Temple.</p>
<p>“Even if you’ve advanced to the Calamity grade, you are just an ant in front of the mighty Dragon King…” The monster roared, but it didn’t get a response.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen waited for the news of the Primordial Spore’s success or failure. As it was too far away, he couldn’t retrieve it. He couldn’t help but feel anxious.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I’ll have to make another trip to Dragon Corpse River and find the Dragon King Gu. Even if I can’t successfully parasitize it, I have to take back Primordial Spore. With Tai Sui, the chick, and Ya’er beside him, Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of Gu at all, so he planned on making a trip to Dragon Corpse River himself.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know the family that built the boats, nor did he plan on spending a large sum of money to buy a special boat. He bought an ordinary speedboat and got it transported to Dragon Corpse River.</p>
<p>“Friend, why did you bring a speedboat to Dragon Corpse River?” A person who was prepared to enter Dragon Corpse River to capture Gu saw Zhou Wen’s speedboat and asked curiously.</p>
<p>“To enter the river to catch Gu,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>The person sized up Zhou Wen and asked, “Friend, are you from overseas?”</p>
<p>“I just came to Chiang Rai a few days ago,” Zhou Wen answered truthfully.</p>
<p>“Then it’s no wonder. I’m afraid you don’t know the taboo of Dragon Corpse River. Typical boats will be attacked by Gu when they enter the river. You have to first get a special Gu-proof boat,” the person warned.</p>
<p>“Typical Gu probably wouldn’t attack my boat,” Zhou Wen said as he picked up Ya’er and boarded the speedboat. He started the speedboat’s engine and set off into Dragon Corpse River.</p>
<p>The person said to the disciple beside him, “That young man has really gone mad. He has actually driven a speedboat into the Dragon Corpse River. Although the engine won’t stall in Dragon Corpse River, the Gu in Dragon Corpse River will be attracted by the sound of the engine. When they crawl into the engine and cause damage to the engine, it will be impossible for him to come out again. To think he brought a child with him. He’s really hopeless.”</p>
<p>“This person is clearly from the East District and is very arrogant. If he wants to die, we can’t stop him,” the disciple said with a twitch of his lips.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen steered the speedboat while the chick and Tai Sui stood on each side of the boat. As for Ya’er, she sat beside Zhou Wen and sized up Dragon Corpse River curiously.</p>
<p>The Gu in Dragon Corpse River sensed the chick’s aura and didn’t dare approach the speedboat.</p>
<p>However, with a wave of her hand, a few Gu approached and swam beside the speedboat as though they were protecting it.</p>
<p>Since I’ve gotten the calabash back, should I use Ya’er to subdue some Gu? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally wasn’t interested in ordinary Gu. If he really planned on subduing any, they would at least be Gu at the level of the Ice Silkworms. It would be even better if he could subdue the Dragon King Gu.</p>
<h3 id='chapter807'>Chapter 807: Collecting Dragon King Gu</h3>
<p>The speedboat was much faster than the wooden boat as it sped across the river. Zhou Wen could clearly sense that he was getting closer and closer to Primordial Spore as the connection was getting stronger.</p>
<p>To people who reared Gu, the Dragon Corpse River was as dangerous as hell, but it was nothing to Zhou Wen. As he sped forward, he quickly sensed the location of Primordial Spore.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could sense that Primordial Spore was beneath the boat. Furthermore, he could sense that the massive creature, Dragon King Gu, was also below.</p>
<p>As they were very close, Zhou Wen could sense it more clearly. Primordial Spore had been trying to parasitize the Dragon King Gu and control its body.</p>
<p>However, the Dragon King Gu was different from ordinary Mythical creatures. Its body was an agglomerate; likewise for its soul—countless souls gathered together. Primordial Spore attempted to parasitize the Dragon King Gu’s soul only to realize that it could only control a portion of the souls. No matter which part it parasitized, it couldn’t completely control the Dragon King Gu. This resulted in the current deadlock.</p>
<p>It was easy to parasitize a soul, but it was impossible to control the Dragon King Gu. Unless Primordial Spore split into thousands of small Primordial Spores and proceeded with a complete parasitization, it was possible to truly control the Dragon King Gu.</p>
<p>“Ya’er, can you control the Dragon King Gu below?” Zhou Wen placed his hopes on Ya’er.</p>
<p>However, Ya’er shook her head. She couldn’t control the Dragon King Gu.</p>
<p>“Is it because it’s too powerful?” Zhou Wen asked Ya’er.</p>
<p>Although Ya’er had the ability to control Gu, there was a limit. The Dragon King Gu was already a top-notch Mythical creature, so it was normal for Ya’er to be unable to control it with her mind.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Ya’er shook it again. However, this time, she finally spoke. “Can’t communicate.”</p>
<p>“You mean that you control Gu because you can communicate with them, and you can’t control Gu that can’t you communicate with or those that are unwilling to cooperate?” Zhou Wen immediately understood Ya’er’s ability.</p>
<p>Ya’er nodded. From the looks of it, Zhou Wen’s guess was right.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, Ya’er and the Dragon King Gu couldn’t communicate. As such, Zhou Wen’s hope of using Ya’er’s ability to subdue the Dragon King Gu was dashed.</p>
<p>Is there any other way? After some thought, Zhou Wen still couldn’t think of any good solution. Even if he made Tai Sui transform into a fish and enter the river, it would at most eat a portion of the Dragon King Gu’s body. It was impossible to kill it.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen’s heart suddenly stirred. Since I can’t subdue it, I wonder if I can store it in the calabash. If I can store it in the calabash, I can feed Tai Sui even if I can’t use it. But how can I store such a huge Dragon King Gu in the calabash?</p>
<p>After plucking it from the vine, the calabash no longer had the ability to take the initiative to store Gu. However, although Gu wouldn’t resist entering the calabash, they wouldn’t take the initiative to enter either.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I can only use the tactic of cornering it. Zhou Wen used Truth Listener’s ability to scout the terrain at the bottom of the river before summoning Tai Sui.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen first got Tai Sui to use its mimicking ability to turn into a tiny Ancient Tadpole. However, the Ancient Tadpole that Tai Sui transformed into was white. It was different in color from the real Ancient Tadpole, but its external appearance was no different.</p>
<p>After lowering Tai Sui into the river, it swam towards the bottom of the river.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen put on the Dragon Scale Armor formed by Demon Blood True Dragon. He also put on the Invisibility Cloak and went down the river with the calabash, but he headed in another direction.</p>
<p>The Dragon King Gu had suffered greatly from Tai Sui. It would definitely be afraid if it saw Tai Sui.</p>
<p>However, Tai Sui was previously in the form of the chick. Now that it had turned into an ancient tadpole, the Dragon King Gu failed to recognize it.</p>
<p>Seeing a tadpole dare approach it, the Dragon King Gu unleashed its might and swallowed Tai Sui.</p>
<p>When Tai Sui entered the Dragon King Gu’s body, it immediately bit left and right and began devouring the Dragon King Gu’s body.</p>
<p>When the Dragon King Gu realized that the tadpole it had swallowed wasn’t dead and was still devouring its body, it was alarmed and wanted to get Tai Sui out of its body.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a real dragon but condensed from countless tiny Gu. It could control its body freely, so it opened a hole in its abdomen. Tai Sui was devouring its body when it was thrown out.</p>
<p>After Tai Sui came out, it immediately used its mimicking ability and transformed into the Dragon King Gu. The two Dragon King Gu appeared at the bottom of the river and it was almost impossible to tell which was the real one.</p>
<p>However, the real Dragon King Gu could change its color, but Tai Sui remained white the entire time. People in the know could easily tell.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Tai Sui’s mimicking ability was only superficial. No matter how big and fierce it became, its strength was still as weak. It didn’t have the abilities of the Dragon King Gu; only its appearance was more frightening.</p>
<p>However, the Dragon King Gu was frightened. Tai Sui was its nemesis to begin with. Now that it had become so huge, the Dragon King Gu was afraid that it would be swallowed by Tai Sui, so it immediately fled.</p>
<p>Tai Sui’s speed couldn’t keep up with the Dragon King Gu, so it could only chase after it slowly. Looking like the Dragon King Gu was useless, and it didn’t have the speed of the Dragon King Gu, so it couldn’t catch up.</p>
<p>The Dragon King Gu was quite frightened. It fled in a panic, hoping to stay as far away from Tai Sui as possible.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Primordial Spore to take advantage of a portion of the Dragon King Gu’s soul, allowing it to have some effect and affect the direction of the Dragon King Gu’s escape.</p>
<p>The Dragon King Gu chose the correct direction. Zhou Wen was just making sure that things followed his plan.</p>
<p>He stood in invisibility at the narrow mouth at the bottom of the river and watched the Dragon King Gu rush over. When it was close, he suddenly took out the calabash from under the Invisibility Cloak and opened the mouth of the calabash.</p>
<p>The Dragon King Gu immediately slammed into the calabash and half its head drilled in.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was originally afraid that the Dragon King Gu would resist, but to his surprise, after the Dragon King Gu discovered the space in the calabash, it continued burrowing in. Soon, the entire body of the Dragon King Gu was inside. Zhou Wen capped the calabash and the Dragon King Gu remained inside.</p>
<p>The Dragon King Gu didn’t seem to have any intention of coming out. It stayed inside the calabash and coiled inside obediently when it didn’t see Tai Sui chase after it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen never expected things to go so smoothly. To his surprise, when he saw Tai Sui swim over, Zhou Wen was somewhat curious. He rode on Tai Sui’s back and got it to rush out of the water with him.</p>
<p>The people that he had encountered previously happened to be nearby. They saw Zhou Wen’s speedboat parked on the river. The girl was still sitting on the boat, but Zhou Wen was nowhere to be seen. They imagined that Zhou Wen had been killed and were about to rescue the girl when they suddenly heard a loud splash.</p>
<h3 id='chapter808'>Chapter 808: Legend of the Gu God</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“I’ve already warned that fellow not to drive the speedboat into the Dragon Corpse River, but he refused to listen. I’m afraid he’s dead. That little girl sure is lucky to still be alive. However, without her family, how can she survive at such a young age? What a sin!” As the man spoke, he was about to rush over to help when he suddenly saw a huge creature rush out of the water.</p>
<p>“Heavens… Dragon King Gu… That’s the Dragon King Gu…” The men immediately trembled when they saw the huge creature. They were so frightened that they forgot to escape. Their legs went limp and they couldn’t move at all.</p>
<p>To people who reared Gu, the Dragon King Gu was almost a god-like existence.</p>
<p>But at this moment, they saw the Dragon King Gu lower its head in the direction of the speedboat.</p>
<p>That girl is doomed! They all thought that the Dragon King Gu was going to eat that little girl.</p>
<p>To their surprise, after the Dragon King Gu lowered its head, they saw a person standing on its head. That person jumped down from the Dragon King Gu’s head and landed in the boat.</p>
<p>The group of people couldn’t believe their eyes. Someone actually dared to stand on the Dragon King Gu’s head. Furthermore, the Dragon Corpse River’s river water was extraordinary. Humans couldn’t touch the river water at all, or they would have the possibility of turning into zombies.</p>
<p>Yet, this person came out with the Dragon King Gu. Clearly, his entire body had already come into contact with the river.</p>
<p>They were even more shocked when they identified the person. That person was actually the young man they had seen previously. He didn’t seem to have suffered any injuries. What was even more exaggerated was that he even patted the head of the Dragon King Gu as though he was comforting his pet.</p>
<p>“Oh my god… Is he the reincarnation of a Gu God? How can the Dragon King Gu let a human touch its noble head…” Everyone was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also saw them and got Tai Sui to retreat into the river. It transformed back into an Ancient Tadpole at the bottom of the river and followed beside the speedboat.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen started the speedboat, causing a long wave to ripple across the river as it headed for the Dragon Corpse River’s exit.</p>
<p>“Gu God… That must be the Gu God…” A man shockingly watched the speedboat leave and muttered to himself. “How can humans treat the Dragon King Gu like a pet? Only a god could have such power, and it has to be a Gu God.”</p>
<p>From then on, there were legends of the Dragon King Gu and Gu God in the vicinity of the Dragon Corpse River. Someone even built a Gu God statue near the Dragon Corpse River.</p>
<p>A mysterious young man, holding a little girl’s hand, stood on the head of the Dragon King Gu, as though he was about to ride the dragon to fly away.</p>
<p>Later on, the legend of the Gu God was accepted by more and more people who reared Gu. Many of them in the South District would worship the Gu God, but that was something far into the future.</p>
<p>After taking the Dragon King Gu out of the Dragon Corpse River, Zhou Wen set off for Mong Hsat. After meeting Gu Shanshui, he returned to Luoyang.</p>
<p>Although Mute wasn’t around to lead the way, Zhou Wen had already memorized the route. With the chick, Tai Sui, and Ya’er around, he didn’t encounter any danger.</p>
<p>On the way back, Zhou Wen kept studying the fusion problem of Ancient Splitting Tadpole. Zhou Wen’s ideal combination was to fuse the Ancient Splitting Tadpole and Primordial Spore. If he could produce a Primordial Spore that could split through fusion, he would be invincible.</p>
<p>However, the compatibility between the two was just too low. It wasn’t even 20%. Furthermore, he didn’t know what the outcome would be after the fusion, so he didn’t dare try it.</p>
<p>He matched the few Mythical Companion Beasts he already had with the Ancient Splitting Tadpole and realized that their compatibility was very low. The only one with a higher compatibility was Tai Sui, reaching a compatibility score of 69%.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>This made Zhou Wen even more afraid of carrying out the fusion. Although the compatibility was very high, Tai Sui had the ability to restrain microorganisms. Even the Dragon King Gu was afraid of it. If it lost this ability after fusion, it wouldn’t be worth it.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me there’s no other fusion choices? Zhou Wen matched the few rare Epic Companion Beasts with the Ancient Splitting Tadpole and realized that the compatibility wasn’t high. The only one that was higher was the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>Why is this thing so odd? Those that have a high compatibility with it are strange Companion Beasts. I should wait and see. If there’s really no other choice, I can try the fusion using Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed as he gave up on the idea of fusing the Ancient Splitting Tadpole.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen hadn’t spent much time grinding recently because he was studying the First Order of Chaos, hoping to advance his Chaos Egg Life Soul to a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>The First Order of Chaos was like the Dao Sutra. They were Essence Energy Arts that mainly enhanced Essence Energy attributes. Zhou Wen wanted to give it a try and see if the Chaos Egg could raise his stats to 41 points if he advanced to a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen’s research, he discovered some ways to use the Chaos Egg. It had a very strong defense. Although it was only a Primordial Body, its defense was comparable to an ordinary Mythical creature’s.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Light Concealment Sword to cleave at the Chaos Egg and required two strikes to leave a mark.</p>
<p>If he used the Golden Overlord Sword, he could cleave it apart with one strike.</p>
<p>This was already rather sick. After all, it was only a Primordial Body. If it advanced to a Perfect Body, it might be able to withstand a Mythical attack without any injuries.</p>
<p>Also, Zhou Wen could rapidly recover from his injuries and replenish his Essence Energy inside the Chaos Egg. It was like a high-level recovery device.</p>
<p>The only pity was that the Chaos Egg didn’t have any offensive abilities. All it could do was defend and allow self-repair.</p>
<p>As the Chaos Egg’s ability was somewhat similar to Li Xuan’s Life Soul, Zhou Wen questioned the possibility of the Chaos Egg needing to be shattered before advancing.</p>
<p>He made a few attempts at injuring the Chaos Egg, but it quickly healed without becoming stronger.</p>
<p>Instead, the Chaos Egg seemed to become stronger after it helped treat his wounds.</p>
<p>It can’t be… Could it be that this thing can only evolve after treating my injuries? Could it be that I have to seek a beating for no reason? Zhou Wen was extremely depressed when he came to this conclusion.</p>
<p>However, the facts proved that the Chaos Egg was indeed becoming stronger when it healed his body.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Chaos Egg was very strange. It would only become stronger after it treated different kinds of injuries that Zhou Wen sustained.</p>
<p>If it was the same kind of injury, although it would heal Zhou Wen, it wouldn’t become stronger.</p>
<p>I have to choose the style in which I’m beaten up. Isn’t this Life Soul too sick? Zhou Wen was so depressed that he nearly gave up on the Essence Energy Art.</p>
<p>However, after some thought, he couldn’t find any other substitute. All he could do was attempt to suffer different injuries in-game before getting the Chaos Egg to help him recover.</p>
<p>Bit by bit, the Chaos Egg grew stronger. By the time Zhou Wen returned to Luoyang, the Chaos Egg was already showing signs of advancing to an Evolved Body.</p>
<p>“Little Wen, did you bring an illegitimate daughter back? Am I going to be a grandmother?” Not long after Zhou Wen returned to Luoyang, Ouyang Lan suddenly visited him. She looked at Ya’er, who was sitting on the sofa, in pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter809'>Chapter 809: Puzzlement</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen’s face darkened as he explained, “Why would I have an illegitimate daughter? I picked her up.”</p>
<p>“Picked her up? I thought she was your daughter. I thought my life would be more fun with her in the future.” Ouyang Lan was greatly disappointed as though she wished Zhou Wen had ten illegitimate children.</p>
<p>“If you like children, why not adopt one yourself?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan rolled her eyes at him. “I have two sons and a daughter. Wouldn’t it be embarrassing if I adopted a grandchild? That punk, Tianzuo, is a disappointment. He only knows how to work every day and doesn’t even have a partner. I’m counting on you and Little Jing now. Don’t be like Tianzuo. Find a wife early and give me a grandchild to play with.”</p>
<p>“Sis Lan, I’m only a sophomore. There’s no rush, right?” Zhou Wen was rendered speechless.</p>
<p>“Why not? Girls in school are most gullible. If you can’t even fool them in school, it will be even harder to find a partner in the future,” Ouyang Lan said.</p>
<p>“Uh!” Zhou Wen didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>“Anyway, give it some thought. I think that Wang Lu is quite good. Unfortunately, she will definitely be in charge of the Wang family in the future. It’s impossible for her to marry out of the family. By the way, didn’t you have a female classmate from Guide High School who was admitted together with you? Her name is Fang Ruoxi, right? I think she’s quite a nice person. She has a huge butt, a sign of being fertile…”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Sis Lan… Have some tea…” Zhou Wen hurriedly poured a cup of tea for Ouyang Lan, finally stopping her.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan drank a mouthful of tea and glanced at Ya’er who was sitting there. She asked, “This girl looks pretty good but too bad she’s not your biological daughter. What’s her name?”</p>
<p>“She doesn’t have a name yet. I gave her a nickname—Ya’er,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan sighed and said, “In this era, too many people have died. There are also many orphans. It’s still alright in Luoyang because of the orphanages. At the very least, they still have a way out. If their parents were to die in smaller cities, the orphans would really have no way out. They might be able to live if they were adopted by good people, but in this world, how can there be so many good people?”</p>
<p>“You still need to cultivate and study now. Furthermore, you are still a child yourself. What do you know about bringing up a child? I’ll help you take care of her. If you have the time, come home and visit her,” Ouyang Lan said as she walked in front of Ya’er wanting to hug her.</p>
<p>“Sis Lan, Ya’er isn’t an ordinary child. She’s very sensible. There’s no need for me to take care of her. She knows everything and will do it herself.” Zhou Wen hurriedly stopped Ouyang Lan.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen how ruthless Ya’er was in destroying the Xiao family. He didn’t dare let Ya’er follow Ouyang Lan to the An family. If someone from the An family made her unhappy, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p>
<p>“What can a young child like her know? Don’t worry. I raised Tianzuo and Little Jing myself. I have experience,” Ouyang Lan said as she revealed an amiable smile. She spread open her arms and said to Ya’er, “Ya’er, be good. Come home with Pretty Sister, alright? Pretty Sister has many delicious sweets and beautiful clothes at home.”</p>
<p>Ya’er sat on the sofa and looked at Ouyang Lan before turning her head to the side.</p>
<p>The corners of Ouyang Lan’s eyes twitched before she took two steps to be in front of Ya’er’s face again. She continued, “Follow Pretty Sister, and there’ll be many toys and delicious food.”</p>
<p>Ya’er turned her face to the other side and Ouyang Lan followed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was rendered speechless when he saw this. Ouyang Lan had just said that it was meaningless taking care of another person’s children, but now, she was insisting on taking Ya’er back.</p>
<p>“Sis Lan, how’s the investigation on Chu He?” Zhou Wen was afraid that this awkward situation would continue, so he hurriedly changed the topic. Furthermore, Zhou Wen really wanted to know if the Chu He who went to Zhuolu was real or fake.</p>
<p>“On the surface, there’s nothing wrong with the Chu He who went to Zhuolu. All the chronological events matched. If you hadn’t discovered Chu He in Netherworld City, no one would suspect that there was anything wrong with Zhuolu’s Chu He.”</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan paused before continuing, “However, because everything about this Chu He is too perfect, it makes me feel that something is amiss, but our investigations have been fruitless. Therefore, I changed the direction of my investigation and investigated all the members of the team. All of them were clean and looked fine on the surface. However, I realized that all of them have something in common.”</p>
<p>“What was that?” Zhou Wen immediately asked.</p>
<p>“After these people arrived in Zhuolu, most of them didn’t or seldom contacted their families. Although communication isn’t very convenient now and there’s no signal in Zhuolu, they will return to the encampment at times. It’s only natural for them to want to call their family and friends. Even if there are a few workaholics or heartless people among them, it can’t be that most of them are such people. I went to visit their relatives and confirmed this matter. They rarely receive calls. Even if there were calls, they were the ones who called. Furthermore, the other party said that they were very busy. They hurriedly hung up after a few sentences.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned when he heard that. “Could it be that many of the people in the former principal’s team were impersonated like Chu He?”</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, it’s very likely.” Ouyang Lan nodded.</p>
<p>“Who did this? What motives does he have?” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“This is also what puzzles me. Many of those people are authoritative figures in their respective fields. It’s not easy to get someone to impersonate them. Furthermore, they have to do it flawlessly. Such a huge setup isn’t something an ordinary person can do. Doing all of this should be a ploy, but what are they plotting? Zhuolu has already been mostly explored. From the looks of it, there doesn’t seem to be anything that’s worth going to such great lengths,” Ouyang Lan said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that Ouyang Lan was right. The motive behind such a huge scheme was definitely extraordinary, but what was worth such a setup in Zhuolu?</p>
<p>The former principal and company were only studying Zhuolu. They didn’t have the ability to kill Torch Dragon and Qiongqi. Ignoring Torch Dragon and Qiongqi, even Aoyin could kill them all.</p>
<p>If the other party had the ability to set up such a grand scheme, he could have organized an expedition team himself. There was no need for him to follow the former principal.</p>
<p>“What does the former principal and company have that others don’t?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I’m also thinking about this question. Based on the information we have so far, there’s no valid answer,” Ouyang Lan said helplessly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly thought of the passcode left behind by the former principal and the metal slab that contained a strange coin.</p>
<p>Could it be that what they want is that coin? Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>On second thought, Zhou Wen thought of the silver-haired Companion Beast locked in Qin Xiyuan’s shop. The huge metal piece connected to the chain had a corresponding relationship with the small metal piece Zhou Wen had obtained. If he hadn’t seen the huge metal piece, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have imagined that the string of numbers the former principal had given him was a passcode.</p>
<p>Could there be something inside that huge metal slab? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<h3 id='chapter810'>Chapter 810: I’ll Wait for You Here</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Should I give it a try and see if the passcode can open the huge metal slab beside the silver-haired Companion Beast? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but think.</p>
<p>If it were in the past, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have had the chance to approach the metal slab, but things were different now. With the Invisibility Cloak, he should be able to avoid the various surveillance cameras in the shop and reach the metal slab without anyone noticing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could have openly headed there and even bought the silver-haired Companion Beast, but he had a nagging feeling that there was something wrong with Qin Xiyuan. He wasn’t willing to let Qin Xiyuan know that he was interested in the metal slab.</p>
<p>In the end, Ouyang Lan failed to take away Ya’er and returned indignantly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought about it for a while before finally deciding to head to Xiyuan Shop to take a look. Now that Ouyang Lan’s investigations had reached a bottleneck, it was unlikely for her to make any further progress. Perhaps the metal slab that chained the silver-haired Companion Beast could give Zhou Wen new ideas.</p>
<p>He packed up and fed all the Companion Beasts that needed to be fed. When he fed Demonic Neonate a few Longevity Fruits, she suddenly began evolving again.</p>
<p>She should be able to advance to the Epic stage this time, right? Zhou Wen was delighted. Demonic Neonate was one step closer to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>However, looking at the remaining number of Longevity Fruits, he felt that these Longevity Fruits were probably insufficient to support Demonic Neonate’s evolution.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there’s still Grim Demon as backup rations. If there’s really no other way, it can be used to make do. Zhou Wen put away Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Before she completely evolved, there was no need to pin any hope on her strength in combat.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy was still evolving. She had been evolving for quite some time. Based on the time taken, she should be about to advance to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>After packing his things, Zhou Wen set off for Qin Xiyuan’s shop.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t directly enter the shop. Instead, he went to a cafe near Xiyuan Store and ordered a cup of coffee. He sat by the window and planned on using Truth Listener to scan Qin Xiyuan’s shop while drinking coffee.</p>
<p>This cafe was relatively close to Xiyuan Store. Sitting here, Truth Listener’s range covered the entire store. He had to figure out the situation inside first.</p>
<p>“Sir, here’s your coffee.” The waiter served the coffee and politely placed it in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Zhou Wen’s attention was focused on Xiyuan Store and he hadn’t noticed the waiter. When he heard a familiar voice, he looked up and couldn’t help but be taken aback. The person who had brought the coffee was Gu Dian.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen subconsciously looked around. Indeed, it was as he had imagined. The cafe was empty; there weren’t any customers.</p>
<p>Does the boss of this shop have a grudge with money? He actually hired Gu Dian as a waiter? Zhou Wen felt that the boss must be crazy.</p>
<p>“Gu Dian, why are you here?” Zhou Wen asked Gu Dian in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Working to earn some money,” Gu Dian answered.</p>
<p>“Can working here be more profitable than fighting dimensional creatures and selling the dropped Companion Eggs?” Zhou Wen was still somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>Gu Dian was considered one of the strongest figures in Sunset College. If he were to sell Companion Eggs he obtained, his income was definitely not something ordinary people could compare with. Furthermore, he was only a waiter at a cafe, so his salary couldn’t be much.</p>
<p>“Yes.” There weren’t many customers in the cafe, so Gu Dian didn’t leave.</p>
<p>“No way? This cafe can give you such a high salary?” Zhou Wen found it unbelievable that a waiter could earn so much.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this cafe didn’t have any business at all. It was impossible for it to pay a high salary.</p>
<p>“150,000 a month,” Gu Dian answered.</p>
<p>Pfft! Zhou Wen spat out the mouthful of coffee he had just drunk. He widened his eyes and looked at Gu Dian. “The boss here gives you 150,000 a month?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that the boss must be nuts. Otherwise, there was no way he would give Gu Dian such a high salary.</p>
<p>Gu Dian nodded and saw a customer enter. He said, “I need to get back to work.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched Gu Dian head over and say politely, “Welcome.”</p>
<p>When the young couple saw Gu Dian, they seemed to be frightened as they immediately took two steps back. Without even entering, they turned around and quickly walked away.</p>
<p>I knew it. With Gu Dian around, how can business be good? Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out why the boss of this shop would hire Gu Dian.</p>
<p>After drinking a mouthful of coffee, he felt that it tasted pretty good. It was actually hand-made coffee.</p>
<p>Unable to figure out the reason, Zhou Wen had no choice but to stop thinking and begin scanning Xiyuan Store.</p>
<p>Truth Listener’s ability enveloped the vicinity of Xiyuan’s shop. It was as though it had turned transparent. Zhou Wen could hear every corner of the building clearly.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s surprise, the floor where the silver-haired Companion Beast was located was enveloped by a mysterious force, as though it was enveloped by a thick fog.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen raised Truth Listener’s strength to its limits as the fourth level within the fog slowly became clearer.</p>
<p>The various Companion Beasts imprisoned inside could be seen clearly. Zhou Wen focused his attention on the room where the silver-haired Companion Beast was. Indeed, he saw the silver-haired Companion Beast sitting beside the large metal slab with its head lowered as though it was asleep.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen’s attention landed on him, the silver-haired Companion Beast looked up and clearly glanced in Zhou Wen’s direction. It was as though it was looking into his eyes, shocking him.</p>
<p>Can he see me? Or is it a coincidence? Zhou Wen frowned slightly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, beneath the silver hair that covered most of the Companion Beast’s face was a grin. Then, its lips moved as though it was saying something.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t make a sound. However, from the shape of his mouth, he seemed to be saying, “I’ll wait for you here.”</p>
<p>He can indeed see me. Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed.</p>
<p>After Truth Listener advanced to the Mythical stage, its abilities were already very powerful. Furthermore, observing someone through hearing and vision was different. One’s gaze was active, so it wasn’t surprising for those with sharp senses to notice it when someone looked at them.</p>
<p>Truth Listener’s hearing was passive. It was only gathering information. Yet, the silver-haired Companion Beast was actually able to discover his location. This ability was a little too powerful.</p>
<p>What’re the origins of that silver-haired Companion Beast? Zhou Wen was puzzled as he wondered about entering.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was somewhat worried. If the chains that bound the silver-haired Companion Beast were unlocked after entering the passcode, could he be doing something foolish?</p>
<p>What does he mean by waiting for me? Could it be that he knew I would come? Zhou Wen was alarmed and puzzled. The entire matter was odd.</p>
<p>From the moment the former principal sent him the passcode, Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. As the matter developed, Zhou Wen realized that it wasn’t as simple as he had imagined.</p>
<p>At the very least, the silver-haired Companion Beast in front of him was definitely a terrifying existence. If the former principal had placed the silver-haired Companion Beast in the store, how could he have caught such a Companion Beast? The former principal probably didn’t have such strength.</p>
<h3 id='chapter811'>Chapter 811: Mythical Rank</h3>
<p>1</p>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen decided to enter Xiyuan’s shop to take a look at the silver-haired Companion Beast. No matter how strong the Companion Beast was, since he was locked up in a way that a Companion Beast shop could trap him, there was no reason for anything to happen to him. After all, Qin Xiyuan and company were fine.</p>
<p>As long as I don’t touch the metal slab or enter the passcode, I should be fine. Zhou Wen made up his mind. After paying the bill, he left the cafe and found an empty spot. He put on the Invisibility Cloak and walked towards Xiyuan Store.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already figured out the situation in the shop. Since Qin Xiyuan wasn’t there, he avoided the places that might expose him and slowly approached the elevator that led to the fourth level.</p>
<p>The building held no secrets for him. Zhou Wen passed through some ventilation ducts and quickly arrived at the top level.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that he didn’t want to go directly to B4, but B4 was completely sealed. No ventilation duct could reach there.</p>
<p>However, this wasn’t difficult for Zhou Wen. There was only one entrance to the fourth level, and it was a special elevator. It was in Qin Xiyuan’s office.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen remembered that the last time he came with Ouyang Lan, she could take him to B4. Now, the public elevator had been sealed. Only this place could reach B4.</p>
<p>Without Qin Xiyuan around, Zhou Wen found an opportunity to release Primordial Spore and allowed it to enter the lock. It opened the lock from the inside and easily allowed Zhou Wen to gain access to the office.</p>
<p>Following the steps from his experience, he activated the sealed elevator and successfully reached the empty B4.</p>
<p>The various seals naturally didn’t pose a problem for Zhou Wen. Miniature Companion Beasts like Gu could enter the locks, making it easy to open them.</p>
<p>The invisible Zhou Wen could do whatever he wanted in the shop. Soon, he arrived at the room where the silver-haired Companion Beast was.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t enter directly because there were many cameras in the room. Even the opposite side of the room had several cameras installed. If he opened the door in invisibility, people in the surveillance room would notice it.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was considering how to enter, he suddenly realized that the entire building’s electricity had been cut. This was somewhat different from a blackout.</p>
<p>In the event of a blackout, it only meant that the power supply had been cut. There would still be stored electric power in some equipment, such as electronic watches, phones, and electrical appliances with batteries that allowed them to continue operating.</p>
<p>However, the electricity in the entire building seemed to have been sucked away. There was nothing left, and all the electronic devices had lost their effects.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately knew that it was the handiwork of the silver-haired Companion Beast inside. Although there was a door between them, the silver-haired Companion Beast was smiling at him as though the door didn’t exist.</p>
<p>“You’re finally here,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said. This time, not only did he open his mouth, but he also spoke. It was different from when he had only used lip-reading.</p>
<p>“You knew I would come?” Zhou Wen didn’t push open the door and spoke to the silver-haired Companion Beast through the door. In fact, they could see each other without opening the door.</p>
<p>“When I first saw you, I knew that you were Ouyang Ting’s chosen one, so I knew you would definitely come,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said.</p>
<p>“Why was I chosen?” Zhou Wen didn’t ask what he was chosen for. This was because the other party would know that he didn’t know anything. When the time came, he would reconsider revealing some truths.</p>
<p>Now that Zhou Wen had asked why he was chosen, the other party would say something. Perhaps he could obtain some useful information from him before continuing the conversation.</p>
<p>“Because you aren’t smart enough,” said the silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the silver-haired Companion Beast in a daze. He had imagined many possibilities, but he never expected such an answer.</p>
<p>The silver-haired Companion Beast continued with a smile, “There are some things that overly smart people can’t do. The person we need is someone who isn’t too smart but isn’t stupid. At the same time, he has to be very talented, occasionally having bouts of inspiration. The person also has to be highly focused.”</p>
<p>“And then?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Then, you were chosen by Ouyang Ting. I think he has good taste. You are indeed someone who’s highly focused,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Then what can I do?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” The silver-haired Companion Beast’s answer once again exceeded Zhou Wen’s expectations.</p>
<p>“How can you not know?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“Because I don’t know how far you can go, I don’t know what you can do in the end. The differing ability levels dictate the different things you can do. When you are still a child, your parents won’t let you work to earn money. When you are a man, no one will request to use you as a surrogate mother. Therefore, what you can do doesn’t depend on anyone else. It only has to do with your abilities,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said.</p>
<p>“I’m not here to listen to you talk about philosophy. If that’s all you want to say to me, I think I should leave,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Alright, then I’ll say something that you’re interested in. Do you know the Mythical stage?” The silver-haired Companion Beast changed the topic, but Zhou Wen didn’t understand why he would suddenly say that. Under the present circumstances, with people possibly coming to check on the fourth level at any time, shouldn’t he say something related to himself?</p>
<p>“You mean the level above the Mythical stage?” Zhou Wen asked patiently.</p>
<p>“That description isn’t right. In fact, Mythicals contain many different grades. The Mythical you are talking about now is just the threshold when stepping into the Mythical stage,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said.</p>
<p>“Then what grades are there to the Mythical stage?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“If you want to know what grades there are to a Mythical creature, you first need to know what a god is. Do you know what a god is?” the silver-haired Companion Beast said calmly.</p>
<p>“Can our communication be simpler and more effective? I don’t think I’ll have much time to listen to your stories here. The people in this shop won’t give me that much time,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>However, the silver-haired Companion Beast continued without batting an eyelid. “In ancient times, humans in a primitive society became afraid of unknown things and dangers. And by manifesting this fear, gods were born. For example, humans were afraid of lightning, so they imagined lightning as a terrifying life form. Hence, there was the Thunder God. Humans were afraid of the heavy rain because it would make humans sick, so there was the Rain God. Other examples include powerful creatures like tigers, wolves, snakes, eagles, etc. Human strength was incomparable to them. They were worshiped because of fear as humans hoped to be as powerful as those ferocious beasts. Therefore, they created totem worship. That is also a form of god.</p>
<p>“Therefore, the first grade of the Mythical stage is the Terror grade. Any Mythical creature that can cause terror belongs to this level. This is also the weakest level among Mythical creatures. The Mythical Companion Beasts on the ranking all belong to this grade.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter812'>Chapter 812: The Final Victor</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Such a gradation isn’t right, isn’t it? Many Legendary and Epic creatures can also instill terror in people, can’t they?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Sorry, there’s a problem with how I’m conveying it. This level is based on dimensional civilizations as reference. Legendaries and Epic on Earth aren’t qualified to enter the ranks of dimensional civilizations,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said.</p>
<p>“Alright, continue.” Zhou Wen shrugged helplessly.</p>
<p>“Floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, etc. These are things that humans are unable to control, nor can they resist them. Once they happen, they can only wait for death. They are known as calamities, and they are also known as the Calamity grade. This is the second level of Mythical creatures. Mythical creatures that can reach this level are considered accomplished in dimensional civilizations,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said.</p>
<p>Calamity grade? Zhou Wen silently repeated the name.</p>
<p>“Although natural disasters are terrifying, they will ultimately come to an end. Yet, some forces are enough to destroy everything. In ancient times, some people were worried that the sky would collapse, while others were worried that the land they lived in would be destroyed. Such a force that can destroy the world is known as the Apocalypse grade amongst dimensional civilizations.”</p>
<p>The silver-haired Companion Beast smiled and said, “Of course, the so-called apocalypse is only relative to Earth. In fact, in dimensional civilizations, there aren’t any existences that can truly destroy worlds. Furthermore, there aren’t any so-called gods in dimensional civilizations. There are only indescribable things. The so-called Apocalyptic power doesn’t cause much destruction in dimensional civilizations. This has something to do with the composition of the world. Compared to dimensional civilizations, Earth is just too weak.”</p>
<p>“What’s after the Apocalypse grade?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“There hasn’t been such a life form so far, so it’s unknown,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said.</p>
<p>“Then, what’s your grade?” Zhou Wen stared at the silver-haired Companion Beast and asked.</p>
<p>“I’m only at the Terror grade. It’s impossible for an existence above the Terror grade to appear in an ancient forbidden land like Earth.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“That’s because this is an ancient forbidden land. There’s no reason to speak of. That’s the rule of an ancient forbidden land. Even if those terrifying Apocalypse-grade creatures enter an ancient forbidden land, they will be reduced to the Terror grade.”</p>
<p>“What’s an ancient forbidden land?” Zhou Wen wanted to know as much as possible. If he missed this opportunity, who could tell him this?</p>
<p>“I don’t know. This is the name dimensional civilizations have given Earth since ancient times. Only a place like Earth has such weak lifeforms. Therefore, many dimensional civilizations want to explore Earth and find out the secrets here. In the past, there were several Mythical wars on Earth because of this. There were dimensional civilizations backing them.”</p>
<p>The silver-haired Companion Beast paused for a moment before continuing, “This is because there have been too many divine wars on Earth. The dimensional creatures that had their strength reduced entered, only to end up dying here. The losses were heavy. Now, the various dimensional civilizations have already reached an agreement. They won’t send a large number of manpower into Earth, nor will they trigger divine wars on Earth. Every species will only send a Guardian to Earth and sign a contract with the humans on Earth. They will fight each other. The final victor and the dimensional civilization that he represents will have the rights to Earth for a hundred years. A hundred years later, new Guardians will enter Earth and begin the battle of Guardians again, deciding the ownership of Earth for the next hundred years.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Why must Guardians decide who Earth belongs to? We humans are the masters of Earth,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>The silver-haired Companion Beast curled its lips and said, “This is typical human thinking. In fact, humans are only one of the millions of lifeforms on Earth. Humans used their powerful strength to conquer other lives and became the rulers of Earth. Now, there are even stronger lifeforms entering Earth and becoming the new rulers. Isn’t this something that’s only right? If you want to blame someone, you can only blame yourself for being too weak. You can’t even advance to the Terror stage. That is a sin by itself.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss with the silver-haired Companion Beast’s words, but he couldn’t think of any reason to refute him.</p>
<p>“Why do Guardians have to contract with humans? Can’t they just fight each other?” Zhou Wen changed the topic.</p>
<p>“This is because Guardians have great growth potential, but the rules of Earth don’t allow existences above the Terror grade to appear on Earth. However, there’s one exception. If you humans are used as carriers, they can erupt with powers above the Terror grade level for a short period of time without being restricted by the rules of the ancient forbidden land. Therefore, Guardians can only continue growing by contracting with you humans and come one step closer to victory,” explained the silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“I see.” Zhou Wen finally understood why the powerful Guardians chose to contract with humans. It was all for victory.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>With this in mind, it wasn’t unreasonable for a Guardian to choose to betray weaker contractors.</p>
<p>After all, with a weak contractor, there was almost no chance of them winning. They could only constantly seek out stronger contractors.</p>
<p>Of course, as a human, Zhou Wen didn’t like the Guardians, much less them treating Earth as a gambling table, battlefield, and dimensional civilization.</p>
<p>“What if all the Guardians fail in the end?” Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he asked the silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“Haha, well asked. Back then, Ouyang Ting asked the same question. However, there’s still no answer because no one other than the Guardian has obtained the final victory,” said the silver-haired Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that someone was coming down on the elevator, so he quickly asked, “Someone’s here. Speak quickly. What do you want me to do?”</p>
<p>“Ouyang Ting wants to know the answer to your question, so he has been searching for a way to win. However, his body can’t take it anymore. He’s too old, so it’s impossible for him to participate in such a battle again. Therefore, he wants to find someone who can win the answer for him. From the looks of it, he chose you,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said.</p>
<p>“Has he found a way to win?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“The method is in this metal box. Open it and you will get the answer,” said the silver-haired Companion Beast as he pointed at the metal slab connected to the chain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the metal slab, but he wasn’t sure if the silver-haired Companion Beast’s words were trustworthy.</p>
<p>The elevator door opened and someone entered B4. He headed straight for the silver-haired Companion Beast’s room. It was Qin Xiyuan, who had rushed back.</p>
<p>Upon realizing that the silver-haired Companion Beast was still around and that the metal slab was fine, Qin Xiyuan heaved a sigh of relief. However, he still ordered the people around him to search all of B4.</p>
<h3 id='chapter813'>Chapter 813: Continuously Looking for Trouble</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen used the Invisibility Cloak’s three minutes of invisibility to leave the Xiyuan Shop. He didn’t enter the password to open the metal slab.</p>
<p>Firstly, there wasn’t enough time. Secondly, what the silver-haired Companion Beast had said was only one-sided. Before he got a clear understanding of the situation, Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to casually open the metal slab.</p>
<p>At the very least, Zhou Wen still didn’t know what the anchor and woman’s picture meant. Since the symbol was engraved on the metal slab, there had to be a reason.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen planned on finding an opportunity to ask the silver-haired Companion Beast again in the future. It wouldn’t be too late to open the metal slab after figuring things out.</p>
<p>Anyway, he was the only one who knew the passcode now. It was impossible for others to open it.</p>
<p>After returning to his dorm, Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that the antelope, Ya’er, and chick were watching television.</p>
<p>The chick wasn’t a problem, but Zhou Wen was afraid that something might happen if the antelope and Ya’er clashed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wish to see the school being besieged by a sea of Gu. However, on careful thought, Gu-type Companion Beasts were typically in the South District. Not every place had Gu. Ya’er could only communicate with Gu. In such a place without Gu, it was impossible for her to summon a large number.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen became afraid that Ya’er would be at a disadvantage against the antelope.</p>
<p>In contrast, Zhou Wen felt that Ya’er was better. The antelope was quite an asshole. Zhou Wen didn’t trust it.</p>
<p>However, as the antelope was somewhat unfathomable and too powerful, Zhou Wen was momentarily helpless against it. All he could do was silently acknowledge its existence.</p>
<p>If the silver-haired Companion Beast isn’t lying, the strongest creature on Earth is only at the Terror stage. Only after those Guardians and humans combine will they have a chance of breaking past the Terror stage. I should think of a way to advance to the Mythical stage first. Otherwise, it’s useless thinking about this. Zhou Wen launched the game and grinded monsters while getting injured so that he could use the Chaos Egg to treat him.</p>
<p>The heavier and more bizarre the injuries were, the faster the Chaos Egg grew. Zhou Wen even attempted to fight Mythical creatures to suffer serious injuries so that he could get the Chaos Egg to treat him.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the same type of injury could only allow the Chaos Egg to grow once. It was useless if he suffered the same injuries again. Therefore, Zhou Wen had to find a way to torture himself. Finally, four days later, the Chaos Egg began to evolve while treating Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>At that moment, the blood-colored avatar was still inside the Chaos Egg. When the Chaos Egg evolved, it remained in this state. Zhou Wen could clearly sense that the Essence Energy inside the Chaos Egg was rapidly transforming. It became purer and more concentrated. The healing effects were clearly enhanced.</p>
<p>Not long after, the Essence Energy in the Chaos Egg condensed into mist. The mist then turned into droplets. With the increasing amount of droplets, they became a water body that filled the entire Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Chaos Egg’s evolution was finally completed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could clearly sense that the liquid inside the Chaos Egg was a type of high-level Essence Energy. It was much stronger than ordinary Essence Energy in all aspects.</p>
<p>After taking a look at the Chaos Egg’s information, he realized that the Chaos Egg had indeed evolved to an Evolved Body. However, its name hadn’t changed. It was still Chaos Egg and was somewhat different from other Life Souls.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suffered injuries again and entered the Chaos Egg to recuperate. As expected, the healing speed was much faster this time.</p>
<p>Could it be that the Chaos Egg’s ability is just healing? Zhou Wen wasn’t too disappointed. After all, such crazy healing ability was almost comparable to Li Xuan’s self-healing.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan could heal himself while fighting. The moment he used the Chaos Egg, Zhou Wen couldn’t do anything else. All he could do was hide inside to recuperate.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t care too much. After all, he had to raise the Chaos Egg to a Perfect Body first. Zhou Wen crazily looked for trouble in-game and suffered almost all the injuries he could.</p>
<p>Although it still hadn’t advanced to a Perfect Body, it gave Zhou Wen a deeper understanding of the abilities of various dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>After all, experiencing their various skills personally was different from seeing with his eyes.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen knew the effects of various skills like the back of his hand. He knew very well what kind of skills were most powerful and the effects when they hit him.</p>
<p>Even so, the Chaos Egg failed to advance to a Perfect Body. Zhou Wen felt that it was becoming stronger, but it was too slow.</p>
<p>There’s no place left for me to be injured. What should I do? Should I find a new dimensional zone? Zhou Wen thought for a moment. Finding a new dimensional zone wasn’t that easy.</p>
<p>Finally, Zhou Wen gritted his teeth. From the looks of it, I can only go there.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reluctantly launched the Netherworld City dungeon and entered. When the torture chambers opened, he entered the first one.</p>
<p>“Ah… Ah… Ah…” Not long after, Zhou Wen came out of the torture chamber and used the Chaos Egg to treat his injuries. Then, he went to the next torture chamber and tragic cries sounded. Soon, Zhou Wen came out again and continued treating his injuries.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shuttled back and forth on the long streets of Netherworld City and suffered all sorts of punishments. Being whipped and burned was nothing to him. What was even more perverse was getting fried in a pot of oil, having nails impaling his body, etc. Such inhuman pain was something ordinary people couldn’t tolerate.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen endured all of them and the effects were excellent. After every treatment, he could clearly sense that the Chaos Egg was rapidly growing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carried on in the midst of pain and happiness. The pain in his body couldn’t hide the joy in his heart.</p>
<p>However, even Zhou Wen couldn’t accept a few punishments. He skipped the torture chambers, such as the Wooden Horse Punishment that Zhou Wen had previously recommended to Liu Yun.</p>
<p>There were also some punishments that were even more terrifying than the Wooden Horse Punishment. Zhou Wen consciously didn’t choose them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen waited for the torture chamber to open every day before experiencing new punishments. These punishments needed at least half a month before he could finish them all.</p>
<p>City Lord Netherworld said that I have to try all the punishments before I can see the real Netherworld City. I wonder what it means. Zhou Wen was somewhat curious, but he couldn’t accept some of the punishments. In the end, he gave up.</p>
<p>Days passed as Zhou Wen tried most of the punishments in Netherworld City. He vaguely felt that the Chaos Egg was about to advance, but it was just a little short.</p>
<p>No, I have to find another place to get beaten up. After some thought, Zhou Wen felt that it was too dangerous to go to unfamiliar dimensional zones. It was better to find someone to beat him up.</p>
<p>I wonder how Feng Qiuyan’s saber techniques have been recently. I’ll get him to spar with me. Zhou Wen contacted Feng Qiuyan by phone.</p>
<h3 id='chapter814'>Chapter 814: Wanting to Know the Feeling of Being Injured</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen said that he wanted to spar with Feng Qiuyan, but he couldn’t invite him to beat him up because he wanted to be beaten and injured.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the training grounds, Feng Qiuyan was already waiting for him.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s surprise, Gulli and Sadie were also there. Only after chatting did he realize that Feng Qiuyan had been practicing with Gulli and Sadie recently.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan sure is a martial arts fanatic. In the past, it used to be Ming Xiu, then Li Xuan. Now, he doesn’t even let Gulli and Sadie off, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>“My saber techniques have improved recently. Coach, please guide me,” Feng Qiuyan said as he picked up a practice saber.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you use the Life Soul Saber?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>In the past, when Feng Qiuyan fought, be it in practice or in actual combat, he used the Life Soul Saber. Today, for some reason, he suddenly used the practice saber.</p>
<p>If it were any other time, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have any problems with Feng Qiuyan using a practice saber, but Zhou Wen was here to get injured. How could Feng Qiuyan injure him with a practice saber?</p>
<p>“I’ve been practicing with Sadie recently. In order to crack her abilities, I can only make some attempts with my saber techniques. I can’t always release without being able to withdraw in time, so…” Feng Qiuyan explained.</p>
<p>“I see. However, you should switch to the Life Soul Saber. I want to find the feeling of actual combat. It’s best if I can suffer some injuries,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement. “Coach, why do you want to be injured?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to explain. “If a person doesn’t make mistakes, he will never know what’s right. If he has never been injured, he naturally wouldn’t know how to deal with injuries when he suffers one. Therefore, I want to suffer some injuries and have a taste of being injured.”</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan was enlightened when he heard that. “You’re right, Coach. I get it.”</p>
<p>With that said, Feng Qiuyan placed the practice saber back and summoned his Life Soul Saber.</p>
<p>However, when Gulli and Sadie heard Zhou Wen’s words, they had different thoughts.</p>
<p>Getting injured when entering a dimensional zone to hunt dimensional creatures was actually very normal. Otherwise, the school wouldn’t have been equipped with specialized hospitals.</p>
<p>Even Sadie, who had the Eye of Odin, would sometimes be injured. After all, anything could be found in a dimensional zone. A person’s strength didn’t determine everything.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s words made it seem as though he had never been injured. He actually wanted to find the feeling of being injured, making Gulli and Sadie wonder what he was up to.</p>
<p>“Although Zhou Wen is indeed very strong, Feng Qiuyan’s saber techniques are so fast that even my Eye of Odin can only see them but not dodge them. If Zhou Wen isn’t careful, he might really be injured,” Sadie said.</p>
<p>Gulli had been practicing with Feng Qiuyan for the past few days. He had a deep understanding of how good Feng Qiuyan was and felt that Zhou Wen would definitely suffer if he underestimated him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t use a practice saber. Firstly, the practice saber couldn’t block the Life Soul Saber. Secondly, Zhou Wen was here to get injured, so he didn’t plan on blocking.</p>
<p>“Coach, be careful.” With that said, Feng Qiuyan drew his saber and slashed.</p>
<p>Before he saw the saber beam, Zhou Wen felt a chill streak across his chest. He immediately moved his feet and saw Feng Qiuyan’s saber slice past his shoulder.</p>
<p>What a fast saber! Feng Qiuyan’s saber speed was comparable to his Mythical Transcendent Flying Immortal, surprising Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Before Feng Qiuyan’s strike landed, his saber’s might slashed down like a raging river.</p>
<p>This was a saber technique that Sadie couldn’t dodge even if she could see it. Zhou Wen needed to focus all his attention when using Transcendent Flying Immortal. If he made any mistakes, he might be struck by the saber.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s original intention was to spar with him, get injured, and return to recuperate.</p>
<p>However, Feng Qiuyan’s saber techniques surprised him. He couldn’t help but have another look. The more he looked, the more interesting he found them. For a moment, he forgot about getting injured, eager to take another look at Feng Qiuyan’s saber techniques.</p>
<p>Sadie was alarmed when she saw Zhou Wen dodge Feng Qiuyan’s attack without retaliating.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, a person with the same physique definitely wasn’t as fast as a saber. Yet, Zhou Wen was able to dodge Feng Qiuyan’s saber. This meant that Zhou Wen was faster than Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan’s explosive saber techniques ultimately failed to injure Zhou Wen. However, his fighting spirit surged as he unleashed his full strength, accelerating his saber.</p>
<p>His Life Providence was Swift Saber Heavenly King, allowing his saber to become faster and faster. However, he had had to control his saber in the past to prevent it from escaping his control.</p>
<p>Now, he was doing the opposite, allowing his saber to become faster and faster. Without deliberately controlling it, the upper limit of his saber speed was much higher. However, under such circumstances, even Feng Qiuyan couldn’t control his saber. He was completely going with the flow.</p>
<p>If he wasn’t in a dire situation, Feng Qiuyan wouldn’t have used such a saber technique. This was a saber technique meant for risking his life in a hopeless situation.</p>
<p>Even so, Feng Qiuyan’s saber failed to touch Zhou Wen from beginning to end. In the end, the saber’s speed was so fast that Feng Qiuyan couldn’t control it. The saber in his hand flew out.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was feeling excited from the battle when he suddenly saw the saber fly out. Realizing that he hadn’t been injured, he immediately felt depressed.</p>
<p>He had come here to get injured, so this meant that he had come for nothing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen steeled his heart and flew towards the saber. He used his body to catch Feng Qiuyan’s saber as the Life Soul Saber stabbed into his ribs.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s actions stunned Sadie, Gulli, and Feng Qiuyan. Feng Qiuyan couldn’t control his saber from slipping out of his hand. He couldn’t injure Zhou Wen at all; yet, Zhou Wen had chosen to slam into the saber.</p>
<p>“Coach, are you alright?” Feng Qiuyan went forward to check Zhou Wen’s injuries as he unsummoned his Life Soul Saber.</p>
<p>“I’m fine. Do you have any other techniques? I want to try them all out and see how the other types of injuries feel,” Zhou Wen said to Feng Qiuyan.</p>
<p>“I only know how to use a saber.” Feng Qiuyan felt relieved when he saw that Zhou Wen’s wound wasn’t bleeding profusely.</p>
<p>“Why don’t the two of you give it a try?” Zhou Wen placed his sights on Sadie and Gulli. They came from the Ultimate Family Clan of the North District, so the techniques they knew were different from the people of the East District. The injuries they caused should have some effect.</p>
<p>“Coach, you must be joking. How are we your match?” Sadie shook her head and refused to fight Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Helpless, Zhou Wen could only return to use the Chaos Egg to recuperate.</p>
<p>“Is that fellow really human? He actually slammed himself into the saber!” Gulli said with a strange expression.</p>
<p>Sadie sighed and said, “Just as he said, he wants to know how it feels to be injured, but he’s just too strong. No one can injure him.”</p>
<p>“Even the Dugu family, which is best at movement techniques, probably doesn’t have many people who can reach that level, right?” Gulli exclaimed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter815'>Chapter 815: Perfect Chaos Egg</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen returned to his dorm and used the Chaos Egg to treat his injuries, but he realized that the improvement it had on the Chaos Egg wasn’t good enough.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, human strength is still too weak. The injuries they cause are very limited in raising Chaos. I still have to go to those dimensional zones to find Mythical dimensional creatures. Zhou Wen gave up on the idea of finding humans to fight. Currently, there were only a handful of humans at the Mythical stage. Most of them had relied on Guardians to advance to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t easy to find a new dimensional zone. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and suddenly thought of something. I wonder if the injuries I suffered under taboo powers count? Those are the rules of a dimensional zone. It’s different from the injuries of dimensional creatures, but it’s an injury, right?</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen entered the game and headed to Small Buddha Temple to give it a try. This time, Zhou Wen didn’t use any Buddhist Essence Energy Art or any Essence Energy Skills to prevent himself from being injured. He directly stepped onto the stone steps.</p>
<p>Not long after he walked up the stone steps, Zhou Wen felt something amiss with his body. Just as he was about to vomit blood and collapse, he hurriedly summoned the Chaos Egg to envelope the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg was really useful. When Zhou Wen was inside, the taboo power outside couldn’t injure him. When the Chaos Egg began to heal Zhou Wen’s body, Zhou Wen could clearly sense that the Chaos Egg was rapidly becoming stronger while treating him.</p>
<p>It really works… Zhou Wen was overjoyed. After treating his injuries, he continued walking. However, when he was injured again, although the Chaos Egg could still treat him, it didn’t become stronger again.</p>
<p>A taboo power can only raise it once. Let me see which dimensional zones have taboo powers… Zhou Wen thought about it and went to the dimensional zones to experience all the taboo powers.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg’s improvement was extremely fast. The effects of the taboo power were abnormally good. It was even more powerful than being injured by Mythical creatures. When Zhou Wen walked around Netherworld City without any regard for the rules, the taboo power activated and nearly killed him. Before he was killed, he entered the Chaos Egg and successfully healed his body.</p>
<p>During the restoration process, the Chaos Egg began to evolve again. The liquid in it that resembled spring water underwent a tremendous change.</p>
<p>The liquid seeped into Zhou Wen’s body and he felt as though his body had melted into the liquid, becoming a part of it.</p>
<p>This feeling was very subtle. Furthermore, the liquid was gradually solidifying. As part of the liquid, Zhou Wen could still move freely.</p>
<p>This feeling was indescribable because it was impossible for a person to move in ice or jade. Now, Zhou Wen was experiencing this feeling, so he found it difficult to describe. In short, it was a magical experience.</p>
<p>In the beginning, the Chaos Egg only had a shell. When it evolved, its insides were filled with liquid. Now, the entire Chaos Egg was one, turning into jade. There were no gaps inside.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg successfully advanced to a Perfect Body. At the same time, a notification appeared in-game.</p>
<p>‘Chaos Egg Life Soul has advanced to Perfect Body. Essence Energy+1.’</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw the word+1, he immediately felt refreshed as though he had drunk honey. He hurriedly took a look at the blood-colored avatar’s stats. Its Essence Energy stat had indeed increased to 41 points.</p>
<p>Although it was only a one-point difference, it was something Zhou Wen had been looking forward to for a long time.</p>
<p>This didn’t just mean that his stats had increased. It also meant that Zhou Wen could absorb the Mythical Essence Energy Skill Crystals that required 41 Essence Energy points.</p>
<p>The Mythical Essence Energy Skill Crystals he had obtained in the past could not be used due to insufficient stats. He felt it such a waste.</p>
<p>Chaos Egg: Perfect Body</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the Chaos Egg’s stats and realized that there weren’t any changes. However, after advancing to a Perfect Body, the self-healing effects were even stronger. There didn’t seem to be anything special about it.</p>
<p>Could it be that Chaos Egg really only has healing abilities? Zhou Wen found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>This was a Life Soul condensed from the First Order of Chaos. Its functions shouldn’t be so monotonous, but Zhou Wen had tried many experiments. Apart from self-healing, he didn’t discover anything special.</p>
<p>Forget it. I’ll think of a way to raise the other Life Souls to a Perfect Body as soon as possible. Two Essence Energy Arts with similar attributes can allow the corresponding stat to reach 41 points. Are there any other Essence Energy Arts that have similar attributes? Zhou Wen began considering his Essence Energy Arts.</p>
<p>The Dao Sutra and First Order of Chaos could be excluded. These two had already enhanced his Essence Energy stat.</p>
<p>The Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra was an Essence Energy Art with a Constitution attribute. The Ancient Sovereign Sutra was Strength, and the Godfiend Era was Speed. Apart from these three, Zhou Wen had also cultivated the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art. However, he had only just gained basic mastery of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art and hadn’t even condensed a Life Providence.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen could roughly sense that the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art was somewhat similar to the Godfiend Era. It seemed to have some spatial attributes that were inclined towards Speed.</p>
<p>Next, I’ll cultivate the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art and the Godfiend Era. Zhou Wen made up his mind to raise the Life Soul of the Godfiend Era before cultivating the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art.</p>
<p>The Life Soul condensed by Godfiend Era was Lost Country. Zhou Wen had actually studied it for a long time. He had read many books on space and fought spatial dimensional creatures. He had vaguely figured out how to advance.</p>
<p>However, there had been too many things happening recently, so he hadn’t had the time to do the advancement.</p>
<p>The advancement method of Lost Country could hardly be described as difficult or easy. Zhou Wen usually used Lost Country’s teleportation function. Every time he used teleportation, Lost Country would actually improve a little.</p>
<p>However, teleportation could only be used once every twenty-four hours, so its growth was extremely slow. According to Zhou Wen’s estimates, he needed to use teleportation more than a thousand times to evolve Lost Country.</p>
<p>At this speed, it was impossible for him to advance to an Evolved Body for a few years. Then, the Evolved Body needed to be advanced to the Perfect Body. It definitely needed him to use teleportation more, something that Zhou Wen didn’t have the time for.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that there was no solution. After studying it for so long, Zhou Wen had come up with a solution. He had discovered a Mythical creature that could teleport. The Companion Egg that dropped was a mount type, and it could teleport with its owner.</p>
<p>As long as he could teleport, Lost Country should be able to advance.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that if he could obtain such a Companion Beast, he could greatly reduce the time it took for Lost Country to advance to a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>However, the Companion Beast named Mystic Bird was the Hero King’s Companion Beast. It was said that when the Hero King knew that he was about to die, he had forcefully transferred the Mystic Bird to his descendant. The Mystic Bird could be said to be the most precious Companion Beast in the Zhang family.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have much of a relationship with the Zhang family. He only knew Zhang Yuzhi and didn’t have a particularly great relationship with her. Zhou Wen thought it would be unrealistic to borrow the Mystic Bird from the Zhang family.</p>
<p>It’s probably unrealistic to farm the Mystic Bird Companion Beast myself. I’ll ask Zhang Yuzhi first to see if she knows where the Mystic Bird can be found. If there’s a chance, I’ll give it a try. If there’s no chance, I’ll have to take an unorthodox path. Zhou Wen tried sending Zhang Yuzhi a message, but he wasn’t sure if she would read it. He heard that Zhang Yuzhi didn’t always use her phone.</p>
<h3 id='chapter816'>Chapter 816: Getting Accustomed to Death After Plenty of Deaths</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>After a while, Zhang Yuzhi unexpectedly sent a message: “Don’t you know the origins of the Mystic Bird?”</p>
<p>“I only know that it’s your Hero King’s Companion Beast,” Zhou Wen replied.</p>
<p>“Isn’t your hometown in Guide City? You don’t even know about the Mystic Bird?” Zhang Yuzhi was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>“What’s so strange about that? Could it be that the Mystic Bird Companion Egg was obtained in Guide City?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“The Mystic Bird was in Guide Ancient City,” Zhang Yuzhi said.</p>
<p>“Impossible,” Zhou Wen immediately replied. Guide Ancient City was called Ancient Sovereign City in-game. He had grinded it countless times in the past, but there were no Mythical creatures inside, much less the Mystic Bird.</p>
<p>“How is that impossible? Do you know that the Mystic Bird is a divine bird that represents merchants? And Guide City has a place called Three Merchants. If the Mystic Bird doesn’t appear in Guide Ancient City, where else can it appear?” Zhang Yuzhi asked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was taken aback when he heard that. He had forgotten about it.</p>
<p>The Mystic Bird was indeed the divine patron of merchants. Legend had it that it was born into merchants. The merchants had always considered themselves to be the descendants of the Mystic Bird, but Zhou Wen didn’t associate it with the Zhang family’s Mystic Bird.</p>
<p>“But I’ve almost swept Guide Ancient City clean. There’s no Mystic Bird at all. Forgetting the Mystic Bird, there’s not even an ordinary Mythical creature,” Zhou Wen replied.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally knew what was inside Guide Ancient City. It was impossible for him to be mistaken.</p>
<p>“I heard it from my elders. Back then, my great-grandfather, who is also the Hero King you mentioned, passed by Guide Ancient City. On a whim, he brought his wife through Guide Ancient City. In the end, he saw a black divine bird in a place called Fire God Platform. My great-grandfather killed the divine bird with great difficulty and obtained the Mystic Bird Companion Beast. As a result, it has been passed down… However, I heard that after that, no one saw the Mystic Bird appear in Guide Ancient City again. Later on, the Zhang family went to look for it and they couldn’t find it,” Zhang Yuzhi explained.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that equivalent to having none?” Zhou Wen was helpless.</p>
<p>“Why are you asking this? Don’t tell me you have designs on our Mystic Bird?” Zhang Yuzhi joked.</p>
<p>“Companion Beasts can’t be traded. It’s useless even if I have designs on it,” Zhou Wen replied.</p>
<p>“That means you really want the Mystic Bird. What do you want it for?” Zhang Yuzhi asked.</p>
<p>“The Mystic Bird’s teleportation ability is amazing. I just want to use it as a mount. It can save my life at critical moments. As you know, there are quite a number of people who want my life, especially the people from the bureau. I have to be wary.” Zhou Wen found an excuse.</p>
<p>“Then I can’t help you. You can try your luck at Guide Ancient City. Perhaps if you are lucky, another Mystic Bird will appear? However, even if a Mystic Bird appears, how are you going to kill it? Its teleportation ability is too powerful. No matter how fast your saber is, you probably won’t be able to touch it.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to try my luck. It definitely doesn’t exist. I’ll think of another way.” Zhou Wen changed the topic. “Do you have any plans to come out for a walk soon? You can come visit Luoyang.”</p>
<p>“I can’t come out.” There was nothing from Zhang Yuzhi after her reply.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sent a few more messages to her, but she didn’t reply.</p>
<p>The Zhang family’s Mystic Bird was actually produced from Guide Ancient City. Could it be that Guide Ancient City is really extraordinary? Zhou Wen thought of the stone saber on the Fire God Platform.</p>
<p>The Mystic Bird was also discovered on Fire God Platform. The stone saber was also on Fire God Platform. If he pulled out the stone saber and completely unsealed Ancient Sovereign City, it was unknown if a dimensional creature like the Mystic Bird would appear.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was tempted and wanted to draw the saber.</p>
<p>However, after some thought, he realized that Guide City didn’t have many experts to begin with. If something really happened after he pulled out the stone saber, there would be tens of thousands of deaths.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it’s impossible to obtain the Mystic Bird Companion Beast. I can only use Plan B. Zhou Wen still had another method, but it was even more unreliable. He did not know if it would work.</p>
<p>Teleportation was actually a type of spatial teleportation. In theory, the Bright Torch Vision World was also a type of spatial teleportation that transported what Torch Dragon saw into its vision world.</p>
<p>However, being teleported into the Vision World meant death, so no one was willing to be teleported in.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s solution was to use the blood-colored avatar’s death as a way to get the blood-colored avatar to experience teleportation with Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World.</p>
<p>After entering the game, Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered to run to the Torch Dragon temple. He summoned Torch Dragon Youngling and got it to use Bright Torch Vision World to look at the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>In one look, the game screen immediately turned black.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen dripped his blood to revive and got Torch Dragon Youngling to kill the blood-colored avatar wearing the Lost Country ring again and again. Zhou Wen didn’t know how much blood he used.</p>
<p>He could sense that the Lost Country ring was growing, but its growth speed was much slower than teleportation. At this speed, it was probably impossible for it to evolve without at least a thousand tries. It might even require tens of thousands of deaths.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Chaos Egg had the healing ability. Otherwise, Zhou Wen would be worried if he had enough blood.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept courting death in his dorm the entire time. He was already numb to death, but the effects were terrible. A single teleportation could raise Lost Country’s stats equivalent to dozens of Bright Torch Vision World deaths.</p>
<p>How nice would it be if I had the Mystic Bird! Why isn’t there a Mystic Bird in Ancient Sovereign City? Zhou Wen was rather depressed.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen had a deep understanding of how difficult it was for humans to advance to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>It was impossible for an ordinary person to cultivate eight Essence Energy Arts at the same time, and it was impossible for them to raise all four basic stats to 41. This also prevented them from advancing to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Even if one could cultivate eight Essence Energy Arts at the same time, the cultivation methods of the Essence Energy Arts were different. Without the help of the mysterious phone, it was equally difficult to master them.</p>
<p>For instance, Chaos Egg needed constant injuries. In the event an ordinary person died accidentally, there was no point in cultivating.</p>
<p>The advancement of Slaughterer was even better. Was killing a Guardian something an ordinary person could do? Even with a Mythical pet, killing a Guardian was as difficult as ascending to the heavens.</p>
<p>Unless I’m like Xia Jiuhuang and forcefully plunder the talent bloodlines of others for my own use, it’s too difficult for humans to advance to the Mythical stage. Zhou Wen felt a headache when he thought of the few Essence Energy Arts he needed to cultivate.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen didn’t have a complete set of Essence Energy Arts. He had complete Essence Energy Arts for Speed and Essence Energy. There was the Demon God Catalog of an unknown attribute. As it was difficult to determine its corresponding attribute, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on cultivating it for the time being.</p>
<p>If the Demon God Catalog added Strength and Constitution, he was still lacking at least one Essence Energy Art.</p>
<p>He got used to the deaths after repeatedly dying. Zhou Wen was somewhat numb to it anyway. All he wanted now was to quickly advance Lost Country.</p>
<h3 id='chapter817'>Chapter 817: Civilized Country</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>In front of Chess Mountain’s mountain wall, there was a strange flower with a flower bud hanging down, as though it was looking at a girl beneath.</p>
<p>“An Jing, you should already have gotten the answer, right?” A voice sounded from the flower. It was The Thearch’s voice.</p>
<p>“Yes, I already have an answer. I promise you,” An Jing said calmly.</p>
<p>“A wise decision. With my help, not only can you obtain powerful Mythical Companion Beasts, but you can also obtain the Guardian’s favor. Soon, you will be stronger than the person you want to defeat,” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that I’ll be stronger than him just because I have these,” An Jing said.</p>
<p>The Thearch asked with piqued interest, “In that case, why did you agree?”</p>
<p>“Just because I want to become stronger,” An Jing said.</p>
<p>“Alright, as you wish. You will become stronger than all humans.” With The Thearch’s voice, a passageway opened up on Chess Mountain’s mountain wall. An Jing walked in.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know that An Jing had also encountered The Thearch. At that moment, he was still desperately being killed by the Bright Torch Vision World. The blood-colored avatar had died countless times. It had died repeatedly for days.</p>
<p>Finally, after Zhou Wen used Lost Country’s teleportation ability, the Lost Country ring suddenly produced a powerful spatial fluctuation.</p>
<p>Half of the ghost face on the Lost Country ring looked very ugly, while the other half looked very beautiful, like an angel and devil coexisting.</p>
<p>At that moment, eyes on the ghost face emitted a strange spatial fluctuation as they shimmered with a strange light.</p>
<p>Click… Click… Click… Click…</p>
<p>A sound suddenly came from the eyes, like the sound produced when a mechanical needle spun. Zhou Wen took a careful look and saw that there was a wheel in each of the ghost face’s eyes. There were markings on the wheel, but the markings were very strange. It wasn’t the marking of time which Zhou Wen was familiar with, nor was it a unit of length. He didn’t know what it meant.</p>
<p>The two wheels in the ghost face’s eyes kept spinning. The clicking sounds came from the spinning wheels.</p>
<p>When both wheels finished one revolution, they stopped. A notification appeared in the game.</p>
<p>‘Lost Country Life Soul has advanced to Civilized Country. It’s currently an Evolved Body.’</p>
<p>Civilized Country (Evolved Body): A lost country, but the origins of civilization.</p>
<p>During his advancement, Zhou Wen had also gained some information about Civilized Country. He had a simple understanding of it. To truly understand it, he needed to figure it out himself.</p>
<p>Compared to Lost Country that could only allow him to teleport once every twenty-four hours, Civilized Country was much better. The markings in the ghost face’s eyes represented coordinates.</p>
<p>After adjusting the coordinates, he could do a long-distance teleportation once every twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>There was also the short-distance teleportation he had used previously. He could use it ten times in twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>I’m one step closer to infinite teleportation. Zhou Wen was rather satisfied with Civilized Country’s abilities, but he didn’t know how to determine the coordinates.</p>
<p>The markings in the ghost face’s eyes were different. They looked very strange.</p>
<p>Could it be longitude and latitude? Zhou Wen still didn’t understand how to set the coordinates. It wouldn’t be good if he made a mistake and was teleported into a pot of boiling oil or a female bathroom.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Forget it. I’ll study it in the future. It wouldn’t be too late when I raise Civilized Country to a Perfect Body. Zhou Wen continued letting Torch Dragon use Bright Torch Vision World to kill the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen realized that the energy obtained from the blood-colored avatar’s death was nearly indiscernible.</p>
<p>I can only obtain this much energy every time I die. When will Civilized Country advance to the Perfect stage? I’m afraid it won’t be enough even if I drain all my blood. Zhou Wen knew that he couldn’t continue down this path. He had to think of another solution.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, have you seen the news?” Just as he was thinking, An Sheng called.</p>
<p>“What news?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Recently, he had been grinding dungeons. At best, he would take some time out to buy some food and daily necessities for Ya’er. He didn’t have the time to watch the news.</p>
<p>“Take a look at the headlines in Luoyang today,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what major event had happened. He looked online and immediately saw a striking picture. It was a seraphim with six wings. To be precise, it was a woman wearing angel armor. She was killing a break-out creature.</p>
<p>Eh, isn’t this the six-winged seraphim John contracted in the past? He found a new contractor? Zhou Wen was delighted as he asked An Sheng, “Is this a picture of Luoyang?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought that if the six-winged seraphim was still in Luoyang, there was hope for his Slaughterer advancement.</p>
<p>If he wanted to kill a Guardian, he had to do so as soon as possible. According to the silver-haired Companion Beast, Guardians could continue growing. After contracting with humans, they could even reach the Calamity grade with the help of humans.</p>
<p>Killing them would only become harder in the future.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s in a dimensional zone near Luoyang. I originally thought that the Guardian had already left, but I never expected it to still be nearby. Furthermore, there’s a new contractor,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Can you still find him now?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I’ve already sent someone to investigate. I’ll keep you informed,” An Sheng said again. “Madam wants you to take Ya’er home for a meal.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” After spending so much time in his dorm, Zhou Wen had reached a bottleneck with Civilized Country. He planned on heading out to take a breather.</p>
<p>While he played games every day, Ya’er sat alone in his dormitory. He wondered if she would develop any psychological problems over time.</p>
<p>After getting An Sheng to make the appointment, Zhou Wen took Ya’er to visit Ouyang Lan.</p>
<p>It was rare for Zhou Lingfeng to be here today. As Zhou Wen seldom came to the An family home, he seldom saw him.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was used to it. Before Zhou Lingfeng married Ouyang Lan, he was often away, so he didn’t find it a problem.</p>
<p>During the meal, Ouyang Lan mentioned what Zhou Lingfeng had been doing. Only then did Zhou Wen know that he had been translating a book for a long time. He was almost done.</p>
<p>“What kind of book is it?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>With Ouyang Lan around, Zhou Lingfeng shouldn’t need to do any ordinary translation work. The books he was translating weren’t just for money.</p>
<p>Zhou Lingfeng said, “It’s a book from a small country in the South District before the dimensional storms. As that language wasn’t very developed and was mixed with many symbols, the translation work wasn’t progressing smoothly…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen listened for a while but failed to figure out anything. He wasn’t too interested in language work.</p>
<h3 id='chapter818'>Chapter 818: Earth Elemental Beast</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>On the way back, Zhou Wen walked along the streets of Luoyang with Ya’er. He could clearly sense that Luoyang was much more desolate than when he had first arrived.</p>
<p>Life was difficult to begin with, and there were often break-out creatures appearing. In such chaotic times, having a stable home was already difficult. Raising children was even harder. Many people chose not to have children.</p>
<p>Even though the Federation had been promoting childbirth, the birth rate of newborns continued to decrease.</p>
<p>Ya’er looked around curiously. Everything here was new to her. Although she wasn’t a real child, her inner world wasn’t much more mature than a child’s.</p>
<p>After all, she had always been trapped near the Kuman Nee. Xiao Tianfang wouldn’t take her out unless she was needed in a fight.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought that since he was out today, he should relax and take Ya’er shopping nearby. He bought some things for her and let her try out some normal entertainment.</p>
<p>Although Ya’er didn’t say anything, it was obvious that she was happy.</p>
<p>Should I take her out more often in the future? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that he was taking care of Ya’er, but he didn’t realize that without Ya’er, he might have become more and more accustomed to being alone.</p>
<p>While Ya’er was playing a VR game, Zhou Wen’s phone rang. It was Zhang Yuzhi.</p>
<p>“You previously asked about the Mystic Bird. Do you only want a Mystic Bird, or do you want any Companion Beast that can help you escape?” Zhang Yuzhi asked.</p>
<p>“Actually, I want a mount that can teleport. Do you have a way?” Zhou Wen asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi said, “Not at all. If you only want to escape, our Zhang family will be selling an Earth Escape Companion Beast recently. Perhaps you can try to obtain it.”</p>
<p>“Earth Escape Companion Beast? Is it a mount-type?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>If it was a mount, it would be very attractive to Zhou Wen if it could use Earth Escape with its owner.</p>
<p>Apart from teleportation, Earth Escape was almost the best escape skill. Zhou Wen naturally wanted a mount that knew Earth Escape. However, if it wasn’t a mount and it couldn’t bring along others while using Earth Escape, its value would be much lower.</p>
<p>Take Tai Sui for example. Although it could also use Earth Escape, it wasn’t of much use when it couldn’t bring people along with it.</p>
<p>“It’s a mount, and it’s at the Mythical stage. However, there are many people competing this time. I reckon it will fetch a high price,” Zhang Yuzhi said.</p>
<p>“Why would your Zhang family sell such a Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>No one would find such a Companion Beast excessive. Zhou Wen found it unbelievable that the Zhang family wanted to sell it.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen had such a Companion Beast, he definitely wouldn’t sell it.</p>
<p>“The reason is very complicated. It’s a long story, but the Companion Beast is definitely genuine. If you are interested, you can come over to take a look. When the time comes, I can do my best as a host,” Zhang Yuzhi said.</p>
<p>“Alright, what Companion Beast is it?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“It’s an Earth Elemental Beast of the Five-Elemental Beasts.” Zhang Yuzhi thought for a moment and said, “There are a total of five Five-Elemental Beasts. They are the five types of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. They each have different abilities. They are obtained from a dimensional zone. One needs a corresponding special physique to obtain Companion Eggs of different attributes. There’s no problem with the origins of the Earth Elemental Beast, but there are many people who want it. The price might be very high.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood that the Earth Elemental Beast was likely the same as Banana Fairy. They were Companion Eggs obtained from special dimensional zones and not dropped from killing dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>After chatting with Zhang Yuzhi for a while, he knew that the auction would be held next month, so there was no rush.</p>
<p>It’s good to take a look when the time comes. With my present strength, I don’t need to worry about the bureau. I’ll use that batch of Essence Crystals I have. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that he couldn’t directly use the Essence Crystals directly at the auction. Therefore, he asked An Sheng if he had any channels to sell them.</p>
<p>“Sunset Army’s weapons factory requires a large number of Essence Crystals. Just sell them to the weapon factory. We will definitely not fleece you,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Alright,” Zhou Wen agreed.</p>
<p>After discussing the details of the deal with An Sheng, An Sheng suddenly said, “Are you interested in coming to the factory to take a look?”</p>
<p>“That’s not appropriate, right?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing inappropriate about it. To others, the factory is a secret, but you are different. Furthermore, there’s something I want you to see,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wish to go, but since An Sheng had said so, he had no choice but to agree.</p>
<p>After setting a time, Zhou Wen took Ya’er to the factory.</p>
<p>The weapon factory itself was in a dimensional zone. It used the dimensional zone’s rules to effectively ensure that outsiders couldn’t enter. Furthermore, the weapon factory itself had tight security measures.</p>
<p>It was different from what Zhou Wen had imagined. The weapon factory was modern and the various instruments were very advanced. It looked like a high-tech laboratory from a movie.</p>
<p>It was rare to see such a laboratory in this era.</p>
<p>“Overseer searched for a long time before finding this dimensional zone. The taboo rules here are very special. They won’t affect the operation of the apparatus,” An Sheng introduced as he walked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw many of the Sunset Army’s equipment, such as Essence Gold bullets, Essence Gold shields, Essence Gold armor, etc.</p>
<p>There were also some that Zhou Wen had never seen before. They were likely still in development. The entire factory was built in an underground space, divided into several levels.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was surprised to see an engine and accelerator made of Essence Gold.</p>
<p>“Overseer has put in a lot of effort in the weapon factory. Every year, he will invest a large amount of money. The expenses on materials are huge. Thankfully, scientists aren’t valued by society these days. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be easy to hire so many high-end professionals,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“How powerful are the Essence Gold weapons now? Can they resist Mythical creatures?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Pure Essence Gold weapons are still lacking, but just like the Bamboo Blade you use, some high-level Essence Gold weapons can fight Mythical creatures if the user is strong enough. However, this isn’t absolute. The item we are researching might be a breakthrough.” As An Sheng spoke, his eyes seemed to glow. It was obvious that he was very proud of that item.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>“You should see for yourself.” An Sheng didn’t answer Zhou Wen directly. Instead, he took him to the lowest level of the factory.</p>
<p>When the door to the independent experimental zone opened, Zhou Wen was immediately alarmed by what he saw.</p>
<h3 id='chapter819'>Chapter 819: Essence Energy Compression Accelerator</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>In the huge warehouse-like laboratory, there was a strange device placed horizontally. It looked like a rocket launcher that could be held over the shoulder.</p>
<p>However, this thing was just too big. It was placed horizontally, and it almost spanned across the entire laboratory. Furthermore, it looked even more high-tech. There were circles of crystal rings on it.</p>
<p>In short, it was a rod-shaped object that combined metal and crystal.</p>
<p>“Are these all made of Essence Gold? The crystals on them should be Essence Crystals, right?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.</p>
<p>If this thing was really made of Essence Gold and Essence Crystals, the amount of materials needed was unimaginable. Zhou Wen had a lot of Essence Crystals, but they would only take up a small portion of the huge machine.</p>
<p>“59% is Essence Gold. 28% Essence Crystals. The remaining consists of supplementary materials,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“What’s this? Don’t tell me it’s a large rocket launcher?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“You can view it as a super-large rocket launcher. Its effects are similar, but it’s not exactly the same. This is an Essence Energy compression accelerator,” An Sheng explained. “Its main function is to compress Essence Energy, accelerate it, and shoot it out.”</p>
<p>“How powerful can it be?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>An Sheng thought for a moment and said, “This is a very complicated problem. The power depends on the amount of Essence Energy and the enhanced speed. Based on the current technology, we can only compress the Essence Energy contained in 4.5 tonnes of Essence Crystals at a time. Then, we can accelerate it to supersonic speed.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know about that. Is there any obvious analogy?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“This is because we haven’t used that many Essence Crystals during our experiments. Therefore, the strength I’m talking about now is only in theory. According to the calculations, the might of a full-powered Essence Energy launch should be stronger than Tyrant Behemoth’s full-strength strike. Of course, this is only in theory. In fact, a launch requires a large number of Essence Crystals. Furthermore, the extraction of Essence Crystals before the launcher compresses the Essence Crystals takes a long time. Even if all the materials are prepared beforehand, the launch will still take more than ten hours to reach its maximum power.”</p>
<p>“It sounds troublesome,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“It is. That’s because we were building on very weak foundations in the beginning. Many of the technologies were figured out bit by bit. We don’t have the optimal solution yet. However, from the looks of it, the idea is right. Essence Energy can be compressed and accelerated before being shot out. The energy explosion produced is indeed very strong. Furthermore, it will deal great damage to dimensional creatures. It’s much stronger than ordinary Essence Gold bullets.”</p>
<p>Upon saying this, An Sheng appeared somewhat excited. “The greatest difficulty now is how to more effectively compress Essence Energy. If we can compress Essence Energy ahead of time and create compressed Essence Energy Bullets similar to ordinary bullets, then miniaturize the acceleration mechanism, we might be able to produce Essence Energy compression accelerators that can be used by a single person. However, there are many technical problems that need to be resolved. The Essence Energy compression accelerator that can be produced now is just that big.”</p>
<p>“It’s good, but it won’t be of any use at the moment, right?” Zhou Wen couldn’t imagine how such a huge item could be used.</p>
<p>If they used it to deal with Mythical creatures, the Mythical creatures were very fast. Before the accelerator could have them in the line of fire, they would probably have fled.</p>
<p>Unless it was a Mythical creature with a problematic intelligence, one that would only stand there and let the Essence Energy compressor hit it.</p>
<p>The fatal flaw was it having more than ten hours of preparation time. A fight had to be scheduled before it could happen. The restrictions were too great.</p>
<p>“In fact, the original goal of such a large-scale Essence Energy compression accelerator wasn’t to kill Mythical creatures in dimensional zones. It was mainly prepared for the scenario when dimensional creatures break out on a large scale in the future,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood. An Tianzuo had originally carried out this research to defend Luoyang in the future. It was very useful to deal with large numbers of dimensional creatures that were attacking the city.</p>
<p>“However, the development direction now is still mainly miniaturization. We hope that a single launcher can be developed in the next few years, but this is very difficult. Not only are there funding and raw material problems, but there are also many technical problems that require the experts to solve. Sometimes, a small problem might take years…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could tell that An Sheng had high hopes for the launcher.</p>
<p>Indeed, humans were unable to advance to the Mythical stage, so they could only rely on external forces. Companion Beasts were external forces; likewise for Guardians. As for An Tianzuo and An Sheng, they clearly wanted to try taking another path.</p>
<p>“We are still studying Essence Energy armor. It’s still in R&D and hasn’t obtained any substantial results. In the future, if the studies on Essence Energy armor and Essence Energy launcher are successful, even a Mortal-stage human could use this equipment to fight high-level dimensional creatures or even kill Mythical creatures…”</p>
<p>“I hope that day comes sooner.” Zhou Wen felt that it would be great if they could succeed. This might be the bedrock for the stability of human society.</p>
<p>Just like in primitive societies humans slowly learned how to use tools and create cold weapons to eventually become the owners of the land. Then, they created hot weapons, cars, ships, rockets, and so on, becoming the rulers of the entire Earth.</p>
<p>Perhaps Essence Energy armor and Essence Energy launchers were the weapons that would allow humans to regain their rule over Earth in the future. The premise was that the research was successful.</p>
<p>A launcher of this size was too useless in actual combat.</p>
<p>“Overseer has always been looking forward to that day. He said that even if humans can’t advance to the Mythical stage and their physical strength can’t match those powerful creatures, we will definitely become the rulers of the world again,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Looking at the busy workers in the laboratory, Zhou Wen suddenly felt that there might be hope for humanity’s future.</p>
<p>Many people were secretly working hard to prepare for the large-scale breakouts of dimensional zones. Even if a dimensional zone broke out, humans might not be crushed.</p>
<p>The only thing they lacked now was time. Be it humans who were cultivating hard to advance to the Mythical stage or people who were researching new weapons, they all needed time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen left all the Essence Crystals with An Sheng. He originally planned on selling only a portion, but he was ultimately persuaded by An Sheng to sell all the Essence Crystals to him. Furthermore, a portion of them were exchanged for items.</p>
<p>When he left, Zhou Wen realized that An Sheng had brought him to see the Essence Energy compression accelerator because he wanted those Essence Energy Crystals.</p>
<h3 id='chapter820'>Chapter 820: Returning to Chess Mountain</h3>
<p>“There’s something else I want to show you.” After leaving the laboratory, An Sheng took Zhou Wen to the Sunset Army’s military camp.</p>
<p>An Sheng took Zhou Wen to a hall where there was a large amount of VR equipment.</p>
<p>“Try it,” An Sheng said with a smile as he handed a VR helmet to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Puzzled, Zhou Wen put the helmet on before entering a game. Soon, he nearly cried out in surprise.</p>
<p>This game was actually very similar to what Huang Ji was doing. However, Huang Ji was making a mobile game, while this one was much more high-end. The VR game with a full field of vision looked very similar to the real Tiger Cage Pass. Even the Demonized Soldiers and Demonized Generals could almost pass off as real.</p>
<p>However, the settings and modes were very similar to the mobile version.</p>
<p>“This game looks a little familiar,” Zhou Wen said to An Sheng after taking off his helmet.</p>
<p>“You have a part in this game as well. It’s the game that you and Huang Ji worked together to create. Overseer got Huang Ji to work with him. This is the latest result. It’s used to train new recruits,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>So the sponsor Senior Huang Ji mentioned is An Tianzuo! Zhou Wen really never expected An Tianzuo to invest in a game that Huang Ji had made.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen remembered that An Tianzuo disliked him gaming. He never expected An Tianzuo to invest in this game, so it was extremely surprising.</p>
<p>“Overseer isn’t actually a bad person. He’s just a little more stubborn than others,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“What kind of person he is isn’t important. After all, we aren’t the same type of people. It’s impossible for us to have too many interactions in the future,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>An Sheng shook his head and didn’t continue the topic. Zhou Wen told An Sheng about the Earth Elemental Beast’s auction.</p>
<p>“The Zhang family is actually auctioning the Earth Elemental Beast? Is this news accurate?” An Sheng was alarmed.</p>
<p>“Zhang Yuzhi told me. It shouldn’t be fake, right?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“What Zhang Yuzhi says definitely won’t be fake. I never expected the Zhang family to auction the Earth Elemental Beast. I reckon the other five families and some wealthy families will participate in this auction.” An Sheng’s expression changed as though he was thinking about something.</p>
<p>“Do you know the origins of the Earth Elemental Beast?” Zhou Wen could tell from An Sheng’s expression that he knew something.</p>
<p>An Sheng said, “A little. In fact, Earth Elemental Beasts are only one of the Five-Elemental Beasts. These Companion Beasts were brought out from the Founding Emperor Tomb by the six heroes. There are a total of five—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. The Zhang family obtained the Earth Elemental Beast, but I don’t know where the other four went.”</p>
<p>“Weren’t they brought out by the six heroes? Shouldn’t the other four be in the hands of the other families?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“In theory, yes. But the other families claim to not have the Five-Elemental Beasts. Only the Zhang family has the Earth Elemental Beast. It’s said that this matter made the six heroes very unhappy, but outsiders don’t know the truth. Now that the Zhang family is suddenly offering the Earth Elemental Beast for sale in an auction, there must be some unknown reason. By the way, did Zhang Yuzhi say why they are auctioning the Earth Elemental Beast?” An Sheng pondered.</p>
<p>“No.” Zhou Wen shook his head slightly.</p>
<p>“If you are interested, you can go take a look. However, it will probably be a little difficult to obtain the Earth Elemental Beast. The auction won’t be that simple,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded. He was indeed very interested, but he was more interested in a dimensional zone like the Founding Emperor Tomb. If there was a chance, he wanted to see if there was a tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>“Adjutant An, the six-winged seraphim has appeared again.” As the two of them were speaking, a soldier came over to report.</p>
<p>“Where is it?” An Sheng asked.</p>
<p>“It’s near Chess Mountain.” The soldier handed the information he had just received to An Sheng.</p>
<p>“Near Chess Mountain? Why did she go there?” An Sheng frowned slightly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t find it strange. The six-winged seraphim had been released by The Thearch after fooling John. Now, it was very normal for people who had contracted the six-winged seraphim to go to Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>“Do you have a specific location? I want to take a look,” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“According to the intelligence, the few times we discovered her recently were near the Qihe River. If you want to find her, there should be a chance if you head over there.” An Sheng handed the information to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll go take a look now.” Zhou Wen read the intelligence and realized that it was indeed written in this manner. He decided to head over to take a look.</p>
<p>“I still have some matters to settle, so I won’t take you there. After all, you know the place well. Deputy Governor Qin is still there. Just look for him when you get there,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After leaving the military camp, Zhou Wen went to Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>Most of the Guardians didn’t have an owner yet, so he didn’t have many choices. He would kill every single one he found, and the six-winged seraphim was a Guardian that Zhou Wen had a higher chance of killing.</p>
<p>The only person he needed to worry about was The Thearch. If it wasn’t necessary, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to see her.</p>
<p>The Thearch was definitely not as simple as an ordinary Mythical stage. Zhou Wen suspected that she was very likely at the Calamity grade. However, after arriving on Earth, her strength was weakened by the laws of Earth, reducing her to the level of an ordinary Mythical.</p>
<p>Even so, The Thearch was much stronger than ordinary Mythical creatures.</p>
<p>Ya’er was also taken to Chess Mountain by Zhou Wen. There were many strange creatures in Chess Mountain, such as Blood Threadworms. Zhou Wen suspected that they were also considered Gu, so taking Ya’er along might be of some use.</p>
<p>“Doctor Zhou, you’re finally here. We were just talking about you.” Before Zhou Wen arrived at Chess Mountain’s encampment, he encountered the patrolling soldiers who greeted him in surprise.</p>
<p>In the military camp, An Jing was training. She had been stationed inside Chess Mountain’s encampment for quite some time. Every time she fought, she did her best.</p>
<p>However, no matter how well she did or how many contributions she made, others would only take her for granted. This was because she was from the An family; she was An Tianzuo’s sister.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Wen, he had only spent a short period of time in the military camp, but he had already obtained the support of the soldiers and officers.</p>
<p>When others mentioned Zhou Wen, they wouldn’t talk about his relationship with the An family. They would only talk about how good Doctor Zhou was and how much they idolized him.</p>
<p>An Jing didn’t understand why everyone still treated her as An Tianzuo’s sister despite her having done no less than Zhou Wen at Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>How am I inferior to him? An Jing trained very hard because she wanted to defeat that fellow. She couldn’t lose.</p>
<p>Just as she was practicing, she suddenly heard a commotion coming from the military camp. An Jing thought that something had happened, but when she went out to take a look, she saw many soldiers and officers surrounding a person. It was the Zhou Wen she wanted to defeat even in her dreams.</p>
<p>An Jing’s heart tightened, but she quickly relaxed as she thought to herself, Perfect timing. It’s time to settle this.</p>
<h3 id='chapter821'>Chapter 821: Six-Winged Seraphim’s New Master</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Seeing the way the soldiers looked at Zhou Wen, An Jing felt mixed emotions. It was something she wanted but couldn’t obtain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, I’ll surprise you this time, An Jing thought.</p>
<p>Even Qin Wufu came out to take a look when he heard the commotion. When he realized that it was Zhou Wen, he got someone to call him over.</p>
<p>“Little Zhou, have you thought it through and decided to join us as a soldier?” Qin Wufu poured a cup of water for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I heard that the six-winged seraphim appeared near the Qihe River, so I came to take a look. Will it be possible for you to get someone to take me there?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“That’s easy, but that six-winged seraphim’s strength is extremely terrifying. I don’t know if he’s friend or foe. If we encounter him, you have to be careful.” Qin Wufu exhorted before saying to his adjutant, “Call Little Jing over.”</p>
<p>“Governor, are you looking for An Jing?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“That’s right. You are family. She’s currently in charge of monitoring that area. She’s the perfect choice to take you there,” Qin Wufu said.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to trouble her. Just find a soldier to take me there.” Zhou Wen didn’t wish to get into trouble with An Jing.</p>
<p>“It’s not trouble at all. It’s her job,” Qin Wufu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Seeing that the adjutant had already left, Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else. After all, it wasn’t a big deal to just lead the way.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that An Jing wouldn’t be willing to take him, but to his surprise, after An Jing came and listened to Qin Wufu’s orders. She didn’t make any outlandish show of expression. She was like an ordinary soldier who chose to carry out orders.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, she hasn’t come to the military for nothing. She has indeed matured and is no longer as childish as before. Zhou Wen felt that this trip wouldn’t be troublesome when he saw An Jing treating him like an ordinary person.</p>
<p>The two of them left the encampment and An Jing led Zhou Wen all the way to the Qihe River.</p>
<p>An Jing didn’t say much on the way, but Zhou Wen was happy with that as well. He had no intention of making small talk with her.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen soon discovered a problem. According to the intelligence, the location of the six-winged seraphim was near the Qihe River, but An Jing had already reached the nearby mountains and was a little far from the Qihe River.</p>
<p>“Didn’t the six-winged seraphim appear near the Qihe River? Why are we in the mountains?” Zhou Wen had no choice but to ask.</p>
<p>“You are looking for the six-winged seraphim, right?” An Jing asked expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Zhou Wen nodded.</p>
<p>“There’s no mistake then. Just follow me.” An Jing continued leading the way, but she thought to herself, You never expected me to be the current owner of the six-winged seraphim, right? Although you once defeated John, who possessed the six-winged seraphim, John was unable to use the true strength of a six-winged seraphim. And I can already use more than 90% of the six-winged seraphim’s strength. It should be enough to fight you.</p>
<p>Seeing how confident An Jing was, Zhou Wen continued following her into the mountain.</p>
<p>After walking for quite some time, An Jing finally stopped at a cave. She guessed that even if a battle happened here, the camp wouldn’t be able to hear anything.</p>
<p>“Have we arrived? Did the six-winged seraphim appear nearby?” Zhou Wen looked around and didn’t find any traces.</p>
<p>Truth Listener was activated the entire time, but there was no sign of the six-winged seraphim nearby.</p>
<p>“Yes, the six-winged seraphim is here,” An Jing said, pretending to be calm.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen had already noticed that An Jing’s tone was odd.</p>
<p>Holy light rose from An Jing’s body as white feathers condensed, forming a six-winged seraphim that floated behind her. It was the six-winged seraphim Zhou Wen had seen before.</p>
<p>“So you are the new contractor of the six-winged seraphim.” Zhou Wen frowned slightly.</p>
<p>He had come to kill the six-winged seraphim, but now, the six-winged seraphim was An Jing’s Guardian. It didn’t seem right for Ouyang Lan to know that he had killed her Guardian.</p>
<p>“Ever since I joined the military, I’ve been working hard. I work when others are working, and I train hard to make myself stronger when others are resting. Now, I’m at the same starting point as you. I have an Epic Perfect Life Soul, a Mythical Companion Beast, and a Guardian. What you have, I already have. Now, we can have a fair battle,” An Jing said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Did The Thearch help you contract the six-winged seraphim?” Zhou Wen asked An Jing.</p>
<p>“You know The Thearch?” An Jing was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately smiled bitterly when he heard An Jing’s reply. “I’d rather not know her. Does she have any conditions for helping you contract the six-winged seraphim?”</p>
<p>“This has nothing to do with you,” An Jing said.</p>
<p>“It’s true that your matter has nothing to do with me, but you are Sis Lan’s daughter. I don’t wish for Sis Lan to be sad, so I hope you understand that The Thearch is a very dangerous person. Think about John’s outcome and you should know what kind of person she is,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>An Jing looked at Zhou Wen and said, “You don’t have to worry about my mother. I’m already an adult. I know what needs to be done and what shouldn’t be done. I didn’t agree to do anything for The Thearch. She didn’t ask me to do anything for her either. Her only request was for me to try my best to clinch first place in the next Companion Beast ranking battle and obtain a divine fruit for her.”</p>
<p>“In that case, you obtained a Mythical Companion Beast in Chess Mountain, right?” Zhou Wen never expected The Thearch to place so much importance on the divine fruit. She didn’t manage to obtain it from him and instead got An Jing to do it.</p>
<p>“How did you know?” An Jing was even more surprised.</p>
<p>“Because The Thearch came to me before, but I rejected her. She’s too dangerous. It’s best not to have anything to do with her,” Zhou Wen said truthfully.</p>
<p>“If one wants to become stronger, one naturally has to take the risk. I know what choice to make. There’s no need for you to teach me.” An Jing looked at Zhou Wen and slowly said, “Regardless of victory or defeat today, the grudge between us ends here.”</p>
<p>“Do you really have to fight me?” Zhou Wen asked An Jing.</p>
<p>“Of course. Otherwise, why would I train so hard? I have to beat you this time,” An Jing said.</p>
<p>“Even if it means losing the Guardian?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>This time, without waiting for An Jing to answer, the six-winged seraphim said, “The only one who can defeat a Guardian is a Guardian. Last time, John was too weak and couldn’t even use a tenth of my strength. Now, with An Jing as my Guardian, my true strength can be exhibited. You have no chance of winning. An Jing’s compatibility with me is virtually perfect, so I won’t betray her.”</p>
<p>The six-winged seraphim had clearly misunderstood, believing Zhou Wen meant that he would betray An Jing like he had betrayed John.</p>
<h3 id='chapter822'>Chapter 822: Ending Before Starting</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored the six-winged seraphim and looked at An Jing as though he wanted her to answer him personally.</p>
<p>“I contracted the Guardian to defeat you. If I can’t defeat you, what’s the point of having a Guardian?” An Jing’s eyes were resolute as she stared at Zhou Wen and continued, “Over the past few days, I’ve been constantly seeking a breakthrough. Even in my dreams, I’ve been thinking about how to make myself stronger. No matter what problems I encounter, as long as I can defeat you, I can…”</p>
<p>An Jing was still speaking, but Zhou Wen had already drawn his saber when she said her first sentence.</p>
<p>Immortal Slaying!</p>
<p>Back when he fought John, Zhou Wen already had a good understanding of the six-winged seraphim’s abilities. He knew what skills he had, so there was no need for him to hesitate.</p>
<p>The only thing he needed to consider was the effects on An Jing after killing the six-winged seraphim. Since An Jing said that contracting a Guardian was meaningless if she couldn’t defeat him, Zhou Wen didn’t have any qualms.</p>
<p>Immortal Slaying was unbelievably fast. It wasn’t domineering because it was too fast. It was impossible to sense any domineering aura.</p>
<p>By the time An Jing sensed Zhou Wen’s strike, his saber had already returned to its scabbard.</p>
<p>As for the six-winged seraphim in the air behind her, his pupils constricted. His mouth moved as though it wanted to say something, but this movement only served to misalign his mouth. His body split into two as it fell to the sides, turning into white feathers that dissipated.</p>
<p>An Jing stood there in a daze. There was no surprise on her face, only confusion and shock. She stopped her words midway.</p>
<p>She never expected Zhou Wen to strike without much warning. Zhou Wen was still hugging Ya’er in his arms. She originally wanted to say that they would only begin the battle after Zhou Wen placed the child to the side, but Zhou Wen held the child in one hand and drew his saber with the other. He killed the six-winged seraphim so casually that it felt like they hadn’t even begun the battle.</p>
<p>I… haven’t even started yet… This was the only thought that remained in An Jing’s mind. She didn’t know what to say next.</p>
<p>After slaying the six-winged seraphim with one strike, Zhou Wen felt a strange energy infuse into the Slaughterer Life Soul, causing it to grow again. He had a faint feeling that it was turning corporeal.</p>
<p>However, even after the energy was exhausted, Slaughterer still failed to advance to a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>Is it still not enough? How many do I have to kill? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>It probably wouldn’t be easy to find another Guardian that was as easy to kill as the six-winged seraphim.</p>
<p>Firstly, the six-winged seraphim couldn’t be considered especially powerful among the Guardians. Secondly, Zhou Wen knew the various abilities of the six-winged seraphim like the back of his hand, allowing him to kill him so easily.</p>
<p>If it were an unfamiliar Guardian, even if its strength was about the same as the six-winged seraphim, it would be difficult for him to kill it so easily.</p>
<p>“Let’s call it a day. If you really want to defeat me, use your own strength. The strength bestowed by others unto you won’t be able to defeat me.” Zhou Wen turned around and walked back with Ya’er in his arms.</p>
<p>An Jing stood there without moving for quite some time. Before this battle, she had thought about many things. She had thought about the possible winning and losing outcomes, but no matter how she imagined the possibilities, she never expected that she would lose before the battle even began.</p>
<p>She originally thought that this would be an evenly matched battle, but now, she suddenly realized that she didn’t seem to have the qualifications to stand in the arena.</p>
<p>Just like an amateur challenging a professional boxer, she fell to the ground before the bell rang.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I hope she won’t look for The Thearch again. Zhou Wen didn’t wish for An Jing to have anything to do with The Thearch.</p>
<p>An Jing was Ouyang Lan’s daughter after all. Although Zhou Wen didn’t like her much, he didn’t wish for anything to happen to her.</p>
<p>After returning to the encampment, Zhou Wen met a few acquaintances and gathered with them before setting off for Luoyang the next day.</p>
<p>Qin Wufu had been encouraging Zhou Wen to give up on his studies and come over to work with him. Zhou Wen politely declined.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to contribute to protecting humans, but that he felt that making himself stronger was the most important. As long as he was the strongest, he could completely eliminate the uncertainties and not be forced into a passive position of defense.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was willing to stay on campus because the college would give him plenty of free time and provide him with plenty of resources and information. It allowed him to walk the path he wanted and quickly become stronger.</p>
<p>However, if he entered the military, he needed to carry out missions. That could indeed help a portion of people, but Zhou Wen wanted to help more than just a portion.</p>
<p>After returning to school, Zhou Wen began studying the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art. This was because it was very difficult for Civilized Country to advance by relying on Bright Torch Vision World. He had to think of other solutions, and he couldn’t think of one at the moment unless he could obtain a pet like the Mystic Bird. However, that wasn’t easy, so Zhou Wen could only study other Essence Energy Arts.</p>
<p>The Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art was a rather interesting Essence Energy Art. Zhou Wen had only just gained basic mastery of it. Although he didn’t sense any powerful strength from it, just the way the Essence Energy was circulated was very interesting.</p>
<p>Typical Essence Energy Arts mostly had a sea of energy, but Essence Energy Arts like the Lost Immortal Sutra didn’t have an Essence Energy sea. However, the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art had countless Essence Energy seas.</p>
<p>When the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art circulated, his body was like a tiny universe with countless revolving stars. Every star was an Essence Energy sea, and the entire tiny universe was a huge Essence Energy sea.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen felt his Essence Energy circulate, he pondered over the profundity of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art, hoping to condense a Life Providence.</p>
<p>Condensing a Life Soul required the blood essence of a Mythical or Guardian. Otherwise, the simulation of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art couldn’t condense a Life Soul without a foundation. However, a Life Providence wasn’t that particular. All one needed to do was gain insight into the Essence Energy Art.</p>
<p>Why does this Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art’s pocket universe feel a little similar to the Endless Sea of Stars? Zhou Wen suddenly discovered something amiss.</p>
<p>The layout of the miniature universe’s stars was very similar to the Endless Sea of Stars. If Zhou Wen hadn’t spent a long time grinding Essence Energy Skills in the Endless Sea of Stars, he wouldn’t have discovered this similarity.</p>
<p>Could it be… Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he stopped practicing and took out his phone to enter the Endless Sea of Stars dungeon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked up at the stars in the Endless Sea of Stars. After watching for a while, he heaved a sigh of relief and revealed a look of delight. As expected, the circulation method of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art is a replica of the Endless Sea of Stars.</p>
<h3 id='chapter823'>Chapter 823: Devourer</h3>
<p>The pocket universe formed by the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art wasn’t as complicated as the Endless Sea of Stars. It lacked a portion of the details, but the general outline was the same.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen explored the Endless Sea of Stars as he grinded. Through his observations of the Endless Sea of Stars, he gained insight into the profundity of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art.</p>
<p>Since Zhou Wen wanted to search for Astral Combat Beasts in the Endless Sea of Stars, it wasn’t considered a waste of time.</p>
<p>He had been too busy recently, so Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to grind the Lunar Mansion skills and Astral Combat Beasts. The twenty-eight Lunar Mansion Skills were still lacking three key skills, so the Star Stealer’s Essence Energy Skill Crystal hadn’t dropped.</p>
<p>Now was the perfect opportunity to explore the Endless Sea of Stars and find Astral Combat Beasts.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen roamed the Endless Sea of Stars and watched the stellar transposition. Every time he gained some insight, the tiny universe in his body would become more similar to the Endless Sea of Stars.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had a vague feeling that when his pocket universe became identical to the Endless Sea of Stars, it would be the time he condensed his Life Providence.</p>
<p>The Endless Sea of Stars wasn’t just limited to the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions. Outside the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions covered a large area. Zhou Wen killed countless Astral Beasts along the way, but he didn’t find any Astral Combat Beasts.</p>
<p>In fact, there were very few Mythical Astral Beasts. Most of them were between the Mortal and Epic stage.</p>
<p>Just as he was feeling puzzled, he suddenly saw something flash in the cosmos ahead.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen focused, he didn’t discover anything.</p>
<p>Were my eyes playing tricks on me? Zhou Wen took a closer look and still didn’t discover anything. He couldn’t help but find it odd.</p>
<p>Suddenly, something flashed in the cosmos. Zhou Wen only saw a flash, but he didn’t see what it was.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen looked carefully at the spot where the figure was flickering, he immediately felt his scalp tingle. This was because a planet that was originally there had vanished. When he confirmed that there was nothing there, he clearly saw a planet.</p>
<p>Devourer! Zhou Wen immediately thought of something.</p>
<p>Previously, when he had gone to the Endless Sea of Stars in real life, Zhou Wen had seen a Devourer. However, the Devourer back then looked like a jellyfish in a lake. It ate planets like eating candy, so it didn’t feel too shocking.</p>
<p>However, now that he was in the Endless Sea of Stars, it was somewhat different. Although the planet was much smaller than the planets in real life, it was still as huge as a mountain. It was truly shocking to see it disappear.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that Zhou Wen didn’t see the Devourer in-game. He only saw something flash when it devoured the planet.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth and raised Truth Listener’s ability to its limits to monitor the nearby area.</p>
<p>Soon, he realized that a nearby planet had been devoured, and he finally saw the Devourer.</p>
<p>With Truth Listener’s ability, Zhou Wen outlined the appearance of the Devourer in his mind, but he still couldn’t see it with his eyes.</p>
<p>It was similar to what Zhou Wen had seen in real life—a transparent jellyfish-like monster. However, its size was far more exaggerated in-game. It directly swallowed the entire planet; the smaller planets in the Endless Sea of Stars were about the size of a bean.</p>
<p>This body is much bigger than Tyrant Behemoth after its transformation! When Zhou Wen looked at it, the Devourer had already wandered over.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ordered the gigantic Tyrant Behemoth to charge forward, hoping to see how powerful the Devourer was.</p>
<p>After receiving Zhou Wen’s order, Tyrant Behemoth activated Absolute Strength and pounced over.</p>
<p>The Devourer was really like a jellyfish. The countless tentacles below shook as its body rose at an unbelievable speed, dodging Tyrant Behemoth’s attacks.</p>
<p>After Tyrant Behemoth struck, it didn’t continue pursuing. It stood there in a daze.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood. He could see the Devourer with Truth Listener, but Tyrant Behemoth couldn’t. It naturally couldn’t attack enemies it couldn’t see.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen commanded Tyrant Behemoth to fight, but Tyrant Behemoth relied on its instincts to fight. With Zhou Wen commanding it, there was a delay.</p>
<p>Before long, the Devourer swallowed Tyrant Behemoth’s body.</p>
<p>It was unknown what the Devourer’s body was made of. Tyrant Behemoth, which possessed Absolute Strength, failed to escape after being swallowed.</p>
<p>This is really troublesome. Tyrant Behemoth can’t see it, so it’s disadvantageous in battle. Furthermore, if it can’t be seen, Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World will be useless. I’ll probably have to rely on Truth Listener to kill the Devourer. Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Overlord Sword and relied on Truth Listener’s ability to lock onto the Devourer’s position. He gathered all his strength and used Immortal Slaying to slash at the Devourer without holding back.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, Zhou Wen felt the blood-colored avatar’s body sink into a vortex before the phone screen went black.</p>
<p>GAME OVER!</p>
<p>Devourer is amazing. Tyrant Behemoth and Torch Dragon probably can’t do anything about it. The only one who can fight it is probably Truth Listener. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and realized that he didn’t have a good solution to deal with the Devourer.</p>
<p>However, the danger of Truth Listener removing multiple earrings was too high. If it only removed one or two, it probably wouldn’t be enough to kill the Devourer.</p>
<p>He once again entered the Endless Sea of Stars. This time, Zhou Wen circled around the area. He couldn’t think of a way to kill the Devourer for the moment, so he ignored it and strolled through the Endless Sea of Stars to condense the Life Providence of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art.</p>
<p>However, the Devourer’s whereabouts was unpredictable. Zhou Wen had already circled around it, but to his surprise, it would appear in different star systems. Every time Zhou Wen wanted to escape, he was devoured by its black hole-like power.</p>
<p>The only time Zhou Wen ran away was when he used the long-distance teleportation skill of Civilized Country to reach a spot where the Devourer couldn’t see him. However, he was eventually found and killed by the Devourer.</p>
<p>At first, Zhou Wen imagined that it was a problem with the respawning of the game. Every time he respawned the Devourer would be in a different star system, but with repeated dying, Zhou Wen began to suspect something.</p>
<p>Every time I enter the Endless Sea of Stars, as long as I leave the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions, I will encounter it at about the same time. This definitely isn’t as simple as a random respawn. Could it be that the Devourer has the ability to teleport? Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised when he thought of this possibility.</p>
<p>He didn’t have much hope of obtaining the Mystic Bird. If the Devourer also had spatial teleportation abilities, he could attempt to kill it. If a Companion Egg dropped, perhaps the problem of advancing Civilized Country would be resolved.</p>
<h3 id='chapter824'>Chapter 824: Pocket Universe</h3>
<p>How can I kill the Devourer? Behemoth and Torch Dragon aren’t suitable for such battles. Demonic Neonate is still evolving. Who is more suitable?</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that there were only three Companion Beasts that stood a chance. He could use Truth Listener with many earrings released or Primordial Spore’s Parasitizing.</p>
<p>The other Companion Beasts couldn’t see the Devourer, so it was useless no matter how powerful they were.</p>
<p>As for the last method, Zhou Wen would have to wear the Invisibility Cloak so that the Devourer couldn’t see him and attempt an assassination.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen began with the simplest method. He first used the Invisibility Cloak to attempt an assassination. While visibly invisible, the Devourer could still see him. He had to use the three minutes of complete invisibility to prevent the Devourer from seeing him.</p>
<p>However, the assassination failed. The Devourer’s entire body was like a black hole. Zhou Wen went over while invisible and used Immortal Slaying on it only to be sucked in. The game instantly ended.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen attempted the second method, hoping to let Primordial Spore parasitize the Devourer. However, after the Primordial Spore entered the Devourer’s body, it was sucked inside and the connection was broken.</p>
<p>With the two methods failing, Zhou Wen could only risk sending Truth Listener. After undoing two earrings, Truth Listener became extremely violent as it tore through space and charged at the Devourer.</p>
<p>The Devourer’s invisibility couldn’t affect Truth Listener. Truth Listener moved like lightning and wasn’t sucked in.</p>
<p>However, when Truth Listener’s claws swiped across the Devourer’s body, it was as though it had sliced through water. No traces of harm were left behind.</p>
<p>Truth Listener failed to gain an advantage in its battle with the Devourer, but it wasn’t devoured either. The situation seemed to be in a stalemate.</p>
<p>However, Truth Listener needed to constantly move at high speeds to avoid being sucked in by the Devourer. Its stamina and Essence Energy expenditure were rather intense. It would definitely not be the Devourer’s match if this dragged on.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and ordered Truth Listener to undo the third earring while its stamina was still at its peak.</p>
<p>Another earring on Truth Listener’s ear shattered. As it shattered, Truth Listener’s body underwent a strange change.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could see Truth Listener’s exact changes, he felt an extremely violent and painful thought. It made him feel as though Truth Listener was about to explode.</p>
<p>And on Truth Listener’s body, black flames were rising like a bomb that could explode at any moment.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen directed Truth Listener to attack, but it didn’t listen to his orders. It roared at the sky as though it was resisting Zhou Wen’s orders.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that the connection between him and Truth Listener was about to be severed. It was almost impossible to see, and Truth Listener could already resist his orders.</p>
<p>Return! Zhou Wen forcefully summoned Truth Listener back, but it was still useless.</p>
<p>Thankfully, while Truth Listener was resisting Zhou Wen’s will, the Devourer took the opportunity to devour it and kill it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen exited the game. The Truth Listener earrings in reality were still there, allowing him to heave a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>After summoning Truth Listener, the dark-gold Six-Eared Golden Silk Monkey appeared in Zhou Wen’s hand. Thankfully, nothing happened.</p>
<p>Indeed, I can’t undo the earrings again. He was still reeling in fear and didn’t dare try again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already tried all the methods he could think of, but there was nothing he could do about the Devourer. He had to think of a way to deal with it. Now, Zhou Wen could only use his invisibility to escape. If he was found again, he would let Truth Listener, who had shattered two earrings, hold it back while Zhou Wen continued exploring the Endless Sea of Stars to comprehend the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art.</p>
<p>Using Truth Listener to hold back the Devourer wasn’t too much of a problem.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen entangled himself with the Devourer, he traveled the Endless Sea of Stars. After some time, he got used to it.</p>
<p>What puzzled Zhou Wen was that apart from the Devourer, he didn’t see a single Mythical Astral Beast in the Endless Sea of Stars.</p>
<p>Could it be that all the Mythical Astral Beasts have been devoured by the Devourer? Zhou Wen guessed.</p>
<p>The Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art’s pocket universe became closer to perfection. Zhou Wen vaguely felt that he was about to condense a Life Providence.</p>
<p>Indeed, in less than two days, the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art began condensing a Life Providence. The pocket universe in his body emitted resplendent starlight.</p>
<p>After everything was over, the Life Providence of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art condensed successfully. Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at the Life Providence’s information.</p>
<p>Life Providence: Pocket Universe</p>
<p>This Life Providence is really called Pocket Universe? Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He never expected the Life Providence to match the Essence Energy Art’s situation.</p>
<p>I wonder what Life Providence Eldest Senior Brother Liu Yun condensed? Zhou Wen wanted to ask Liu Yun, but he couldn’t find him.</p>
<p>Although the two of them had cultivated the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art, their bloodlines and minds were different, so the Life Providences they condensed would be different.</p>
<p>Pocket Universe: Producing the universe with one’s body.</p>
<p>What does it mean by producing the universe with one’s body? Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss. What did this Life Providence mean?</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen switched to the Pocket Universe Life Providence and used the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art, he came to a slight realization.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know about the other functions for the time being, but he definitely wouldn’t get lost again. The Pocket Universe Life Providence was like a GPS. No matter where he went, he would know his position in the universe.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that he wouldn’t get lost on Earth, Zhou Wen guessed that he wouldn’t even get lost in the universe.</p>
<p>It turns out that this Life Providence is just a locator? Zhou Wen was already suspicious of his previous guess, wondering if the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art was an Essence Energy Art that increased Speed.</p>
<p>The next step is to condense a Life Soul. I’ll first try to see if the Guardian’s blood in the underground sea can help the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art advance. Although Zhou Wen wasn’t the Guardian’s match, it wasn’t difficult to obtain a drop of blood. He could also farm the nine dragons.</p>
<p>The Guardian had a spatial attribute, so Zhou Wen felt that its compatibility with the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art was very high. It was highly likely to work.</p>
<p>The nine dragons didn’t drop anything useful as Zhou Wen forcefully extracted a drop of blood from the Guardian. To his surprise, the drop of blood couldn’t be absorbed by the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art.</p>
<p>It doesn’t work? Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat as he had no choice but to head to Ant City to give it a try.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen was still praying that he wouldn’t be compatible with the guardian of Ant City. Otherwise, the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art might be an Essence Energy Art that enhanced his Essence Energy. Zhou Wen no longer needed such an Essence Energy Art, so cultivating it was a waste of time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried it in fear, but thankfully, he was unable to absorb it. While Zhou Wen was delighted, he was also somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>Now that the blood from these two Guardians wasn’t working, he didn’t know where to find another drop of Guardian’s blood.</p>
<p>This sure is troublesome. Zhou Wen only knew a few Guardians. Furthermore, once a Guardian contracted a human and truly broke out of the cocoon, their blood would be useless. He had to find a Guardian that had yet to leave its cocoon and then extract their blood essence.</p>
<h3 id='chapter825'>Chapter 825: Lady of the Stars</h3>
<p>Is there any Guardian related to the stars or the universe? Zhou Wen sat on the sofa and muttered to himself. It was too difficult to find a suitable Guardian. The key problem was that Zhou Wen didn’t know where the Guardians were.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had the urge to take the chick back to the phoenix’s nest to discuss with the phoenix. He wanted to see if he could obtain a drop of blood essence from the cocoon protected by the phoenix.</p>
<p>Just as he was considering it, the antelope walked over and stood opposite Zhou Wen, writing on the ground with its hooves.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. The antelope usually ignored him, so he wasn’t sure why it had suddenly come over. He hurriedly looked at the ground.</p>
<p>“You want to find a Guardian related to the stars?” The antelope wrote on the ground.</p>
<p>“So what if I do? Do you know where to find one?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you already see it before? Why are you asking where it is?” the antelope continued writing.</p>
<p>“When did I see it?” Zhou Wen frowned. He couldn’t remember when he had seen such a Guardian.</p>
<p>“Not only have you seen it, but you have also carried it.” The antelope looked at Zhou Wen in a teasing manner and continued writing.</p>
<p>“When did I carry… it…” Zhou Wen suddenly reacted as he widened his eyes and asked the antelope, “Are you saying that there’s a Guardian inside the log?”</p>
<p>The antelope smiled at Zhou Wen and wrote: “That’s a Guardian with the Life Providence of the Lady of the Stars. She’s also a top existence among Guardians. You originally had the chance to contract her, but unfortunately, you screwed up. Not only did you fail to contract her, but you even became an enemy. Do you regret it now?”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you say so earlier? How would I know?” Zhou Wen said helplessly.</p>
<p>“How do I tell you? You had to keep carrying that log. Did you want me to tell you in front of her that you have to lie to her and think of a way to cheat her?” The antelope curled its lips.</p>
<p>“You could have told me in advance.” Zhou Wen paused before continuing, “Let’s not talk about this first. Do you have a way to help me obtain a drop of her blood essence?”</p>
<p>“Why do you want her blood essence?” The antelope looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“I’m cultivating an Essence Energy Art, but I don’t have a special physique that matches it. I need a drop of Guardian’s blood with the same stats as a foundation,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“What Essence Energy Art is it?” the antelope asked.</p>
<p>“Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art.” Zhou Wen had no intention of hiding it. Having followed him for so long, the antelope naturally knew that he knew many Essence Energy Arts. There was nothing to hide.</p>
<p>“So it’s the Sky-Stealing technique. It’s possible to use her blood essence as a foundation…” When the antelope said that, it pondered for a moment before continuing, “Now that she has returned to Forbidden City, Forbidden City has experienced a recovery in Essence Energy, so it will definitely be extremely terrifying. Furthermore, she probably doesn’t have a good impression of you. Even if you have a Companion Beast like Tyrant Behemoth, you will probably die after entering. It’s basically impossible to obtain her blood essence.”</p>
<p>“Is there no other way?” Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>Even the antelope said that there was no hope, so Zhou Wen felt that there was no need to take the risk.</p>
<p>To his surprise, the antelope changed the topic and continued writing. “However, your luck isn’t bad. I happen to have some of her blood essence.”</p>
<p>“You have her blood essence? When did you obtain it?” Zhou Wen didn’t believe the antelope.</p>
<p>The Guardian had always been inside the log. The log had never been opened, and the antelope had never touched the log. How could it obtain the blood essence?</p>
<p>“Of course it wasn’t obtained recently. The one in the log is one of the few Guardians that survived the last Guardian Battle. This blood essence was obtained in the past.” After the antelope finished writing, it shook its body and a small jade bottle dropped from the fur around its neck.</p>
<p>This fellow is actually hiding something? Zhou Wen sized up the antelope’s fur in surprise.</p>
<p>The antelope’s fur was very short. Only the fur around its neck was slightly longer. However, it couldn’t hide a bottle no matter what, so he had no idea how it had hidden the bottle.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out to take the jade bottle, but he was stopped by the antelope’s hooves.</p>
<p>“You can have the blood essence, but I have a condition,” the antelope wrote.</p>
<p>“You live off me, and you still want to negotiate with me?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“Do you want it?” The antelope had no intention of reasoning with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Alright, tell me. What are your conditions?” Zhou Wen had no choice but to ask patiently.</p>
<p>“In the future, if you have the ability, you have to make another trip to Forbidden City and get something from her. Originally, as long as you contracted with her, that thing would have been ours, but it ended up in this state. Now, there’s no other way but to use force,” the antelope wrote.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“You’ll know when the time comes. Don’t worry, I’ll help you. When the time comes, we’ll split it according to our agreement—20-80.”</p>
<p>“That won’t do. In the past, we said 20-80 because you were the one who found the log. Now that we are cooperating, we naturally can’t do 20-80 again. 40-60, I’ll get 60% while you get 40%. After all, I know nothing about it. The risk is rather high.” Although Zhou Wen didn’t know what it was, he wasn’t willing to suffer a loss.</p>
<p>He wanted the blood essence anyway, so he definitely had to agree to the antelope’s conditions. It wasn’t a bad idea to fight for some benefits.</p>
<p>“Impossible.” The antelope rejected it directly.</p>
<p>Seeing its firm attitude, Zhou Wen said, “Then split it 50-50. It can’t be any lower.”</p>
<p>“You don’t want the blood essence?” The antelope pointed at the small jade bottle.</p>
<p>“40-60. You get 60% while I get 40%. That’s my bottom line. Besides, you have to put in some effort. You can’t let me take it all alone,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Deal.” The antelope handed the jade bottle to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took the jade bottle and opened it. He saw a tiny blob of blood inside. The blood was a strange purple color that suffused faint purple starlight. It was as though there was purple star sand inside. It looked beautiful and mysterious.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had come into contact with the blood essence of many Guardians, so he knew at a glance that it was the blood essence of a real Guardian. However, its attribute was different from anything he had seen before. It was very similar to the aura in the log, so it was likely real.</p>
<p>After returning to the training room with the blood, Zhou Wen attempted to use the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art to absorb the blood in the jade bottle, and he successfully refined it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately felt the Pocket Universe in his body erupt. The purple blood essence provided the Pocket Universe with terrifying energy, causing it to emit terrifying starlight.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt his essence, vitality, and spirit condense inside the pocket universe. This was the precursor to condensing a Life Soul.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because he had absorbed too much blood essence this time—possibly about eight drops—compared to a single drop in the past, the energy contained was much more than before, causing the Life Soul to condense at an abnormally fast speed.</p>
<p>A speck of starlight condensed in between Zhou Wen’s brows as it shimmered with a purple glow.</p>
<h3 id='chapter826'>Chapter 826: Fine Dust</h3>
<p>It was a purple star that resembled a particle. It emitted a resplendent divine light that floated between Zhou Wen’s brows like a gem.</p>
<p>Life Soul: Fine Dust (Primordial Body)</p>
<p>Fine Dust: Millions of galaxies are just the dust of the boundless universe. A tiny speck of dust can also be a trichiliocosm.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the Fine Dust Life Soul and felt its body emit powerful stellar forces. A tiny bit of information surged into Zhou Wen’s mind, allowing him to gain a rough understanding of Fine Dust.</p>
<p>Although it was called Fine Dust, it was actually a miniature star. With the Fine Dust Life Soul and the Pocket Universe Life Providence, Zhou Wen could travel through space.</p>
<p>This was somewhat similar to the ability of Civilized Country. The difference was that the Fine Dust Life Soul could only be used to travel between planets. As long as there were stars in the Pocket Universe, Zhou Wen could use Fine Dust’s ability to travel to that planet.</p>
<p>For example, planets that were relatively close to Earth like the Moon, Venus, Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, Saturn, as well as the planets in the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions, or even planets that were even further away. As long as they were within the Pocket Universe, he could teleport over using Fine Dust.</p>
<p>However, Fine Dust had a longer cooldown period. It could only be used once a month.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to try heading to the moon to take a look, but on second thought, he immediately gave up on such plans. His current body didn’t have the ability to survive in space. He could only teleport once a month. If he were to teleport out now, he wouldn’t be able to return. If that happened, wouldn’t he die of suffocation in space?</p>
<p>Fine Dust’s ability looks impressive, but it doesn’t seem to be of much use. This thing can only be used for interstellar travel and doesn’t allow free teleportation within a planet. However, humans have yet to discover any habitable planets outside Earth. Wouldn’t teleporting to them be courting death? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>However, thankfully, apart from the interstellar teleportation ability, Fine Dust also had enhancement effects on Speed, Strength, and Essence Energy. On a bright night with stars, he could also enjoy the augmentation of the stellar forces.</p>
<p>It could also be done during the day, but because the sunlight during the day was too strong, the augmentation from the other stars weakened. The main augmentation came from the sun.</p>
<p>Thankfully, after advancing to the Mythical stage, typically speaking, one should have the ability to survive in space. This ability would definitely be of great use in the future.</p>
<p>This was the basic function of Fine Dust. Zhou Wen still needed to figure out the other methods and abilities himself.</p>
<p>How can I advance Fine Dust? Zhou Wen continued studying the method to advance his Fine Dust Life Soul.</p>
<p>After entering the game, Zhou Wen tried out Fine Dust’s interstellar teleportation ability. It was really effective. The Fine Dust on his forehead flashed with a purple light as it took him across more than half the Pocket Universe to a tiny planet that he had never been to.</p>
<p>Then, he entered cooldown mode and had to wait a month until he could use it again.</p>
<p>This cooldown time is too long! Interstellar teleportation felt great, but it could only be used once a month. It was too much of a scam.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on using it in real life. If he had used it in a rush, it would have been too late when he realized he had to wait for a month.</p>
<p>After studying his Life Soul in-game for a long time, he didn’t find any way to level up Fine Dust. The method of observing the Pocket Universe to condense a Life Soul clearly wasn’t of any help to Fine Dust.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, are you coming to the auction?” Zhang Yuzhi sent Zhou Wen a message.</p>
<p>“Of course,” Zhou Wen replied.</p>
<p>Although Civilization Country could also teleport, the restrictions were too great. An Earth Escape mount was more useful. Even if he failed to win the bid, he could still broaden his horizons.</p>
<p>It wasn’t usually easy to see the six families together.</p>
<p>“Remember to inform me before you arrive. I’ll arrange a place for you to stay. There are too many people participating in the auction this time, so it’s not convenient for you to stay outside. You can stay in my family’s courtyard,” Zhang Yuzhi said.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen didn’t plan on standing on ceremony.</p>
<p>It was rare for Zhang Yuzhi to chat with him for a while, but it didn’t last more than ten minutes before there was suddenly no message. It was as though she had gone offline.</p>
<p>Could she be using her phone behind her family’s back? Zhou Wen thought of this possibility.</p>
<p>To the Zhang family, Zhang Yuzhi was too important. Her every action was closely protected by them. Many things were out of her control.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it’s not necessarily a good thing to be too special. People like Zhang Yuzhi and Wang Lu have abilities that others dream of, but they might not necessarily be happy, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>In the morning, Zhou Wen took Ya’er out for a stroll. Zhou Wen took the time to take her out every morning to interact more with human society.</p>
<p>Sunset College also had students who had children, but they were basically graduate students. He was probably the first sophomore to have a child.</p>
<p>Thankfully, everyone in school knew of Zhou Wen’s relationship with Ouyang Lan, so no one said anything.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen led her to the activity room of the Xuanwen Club. When Fang Ruoxi saw her, she pointed at Ya’er’s clothes and said, “Zhou Wen, Ya’er’s clothes seem to be small. It’s time to buy her new clothes.”</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen realize that the clothes on Ya’er’s body were indeed a little small. Children grew very quickly. In just a month, she had grown quite a lot.</p>
<p>“You’re still a boy. How can you take good care of Ya’er? Why don’t you hire a nanny to take care of her?” Fang Ruoxi suggested.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. I’ll slowly learn how to take care of her.” Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t let others take care of Ya’er. Who knew what would happen?</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, could Ya’er really be your daughter?” Tian Xiangdong asked.</p>
<p>“It would be good if that was the case.” Zhou Wen was somewhat helpless.</p>
<p>If Ya’er was really his daughter, Zhou Wen could still get Ouyang Lan to help him take care of her. Unfortunately, no matter how troublesome it was, Zhou Wen had no choice but to take care of her himself.</p>
<p>“How old is this girl? My relative’s child is a little younger than her, but she can already call her parents. Why can’t she say a word? Didn’t you teach her?” Tian Xiangdong teased Ya’er as he spoke. “Ya’er, call Uncle… Uncle…”</p>
<p>Ya’er sat on the stool and looked at Tian Xiangdong without any change in expression. Tian Xiangdong felt like a fool. He laughed dryly and stopped teasing her.</p>
<p>“Ya’er, wait for me here for a while. Don’t mess around, alright?” Zhou Wen wanted to go to the bathroom and couldn’t take Ya’er with him. He believed that it would be fine to let her stay here.</p>
<p>Before leaving, Zhou Wen even exhorted Fang Ruoxi to help take care of Ya’er and not let anyone tease her.</p>
<p>Not long after Zhou Wen left, someone came to the activity room. He couldn’t help but be taken aback when he saw Ya’er sitting on a stool.</p>
<p>“Why is there a child here?” the person asked.</p>
<h3 id='chapter827'>Chapter 827: Yun Niu</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“This is Zhou Wen’s adopted child,” Tian Xiangdong said when he saw that it was Yun Niu.</p>
<p>Yun Niu was a freshman who had just joined the Xuanwen Club. Zhou Wen had never met him before.</p>
<p>“Ah, so it’s the famous Senior Zhou’s child. I didn’t expect him to be extremely talented in cultivation and very caring. He’s both morally and technically good.” As Yun Niu spoke, he went forward to pinch Ya’er’s face. “This child is really cute. What’s her name?”</p>
<p>However, Ya’er took two steps back and dodged Yun Niu’s hand.</p>
<p>“This child is afraid of strangers. Don’t scare her,” Fang Ruoxi pulled Ya’er back and said to Yun Niu.</p>
<p>“Children should be more lively. Once they start seeing more people, they naturally won’t be afraid.” As Yun Niu spoke, he searched his body and took out a handful of candies from his pocket. “Come, these candies are high quality stuff. They are delicious. Call me uncle and I’ll give them all to you.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Ya’er only looked at Yun Niu silently.</p>
<p>Seeing that Ya’er wasn’t moved, Yun Niu peeled a piece of candy and placed it in its mouth to chew. As he chewed, he said, “It’s fragrant and sweet. This piece is for you. Try it first.”</p>
<p>However, Ya’er didn’t reach out to take it. She continued to look at him expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with this child?” Yun Niu frowned slightly. He had seen many children, but none of them were like Ya’er.</p>
<p>Some introverted and timid children would show some expression even if they didn’t dare to take it or were frightened by him. They wouldn’t be so expressionless.</p>
<p>However, Ya’er was clearly not afraid of him. She looked at him but ignored him.</p>
<p>“Don’t you like candy? I still have many treasures here. Let’s see if you like them.” Yun Niu opened his backpack and took out a rattle drum, a small pistol, a doll, a bell, and other toys. He placed them on the table one by one.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Look at how fun this is. Here you go.” Yun Niu shook the rattle drum in front of Ya’er.</p>
<p>However, Ya’er still looked at him and had no intention of reaching out to take it.</p>
<p>“Is this child deaf and mute?” Yun Niu asked gloomily.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by deaf and mute? She’s young and can’t even speak. By the way, why do you have so many children’s toys on you? Where did you get them?” Tian Xiangdong asked.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“I bought this. I’m planning on taking it back for my niece to play during the holidays. However, it looks like these things can’t attract a little girl,” Yun Niu said in frustration.</p>
<p>“I never expected you to be so meticulous. You actually have your niece on your mind,” Tian Xiangdong said with a smile.</p>
<p>“I just didn’t know what to buy, so I bought a little of everything. It looks like it won’t work.” As he spoke, Tian Xiangdong picked up the toys and handed them to Ya’er. “How about this? Do you like this?”</p>
<p>Yun Niu tried many things, but Ya’er didn’t react.</p>
<p>Just as Yun Niu was giving up hope, Ya’er suddenly pointed at Yun Niu’s backpack.</p>
<p>Yun Niu was delighted. “What do you want? Uncle will give it to you.”</p>
<p>Ya’er still pointed at the backpack with her tiny hand. Yun Niu poured out all the things inside and said to Ya’er, “Which one do you like? Take it yourself.”</p>
<p>Ya’er reached out and grabbed something. When Yun Niu saw what Ya’er was grabbing, he couldn’t help but be slightly stunned. “Strange, why is that thing in the backpack? Could it be that it was accidentally stuffed inside when I was putting things in?”</p>
<p>“This…” Yun Niu wanted to stop Ya’er, but after some thought, he allowed Ya’er to grab it.</p>
<p>It was a necklace with many rubies embedded in it. It looked very beautiful.</p>
<p>Although the value of gems wasn’t as expensive as before, this necklace was clearly a high-quality item. Before the dimensional storms, it could probably have been sold for hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>Even now, it was probably worth some money. After all, such gemstones were still very rare.</p>
<p>“A girl is a girl. They know beauty from a young age. She chose such a beautiful necklace. Yun Niu, is this necklace real?” Tian Xiangdong asked.</p>
<p>“How can it be real? It’s a replica. If she likes it, let her play with it,” Yun Niu said.</p>
<p>“That’s good.” Fang Ruoxi pulled Ya’er to the side and said, “Ya’er, I’ll put it on for you.”</p>
<p>Ya’er released her hand. After Fang Ruoxi took the necklace, she put it on Ya’er’s neck and said, “Ya’er, you’re so beautiful.”</p>
<p>However, Ya’er didn’t react. She wore the necklace and remained expressionless, as if she was facially paralyzed.</p>
<p>Yun Niu took out a pearl necklace from the toys and said to Ya’er, “Is the necklace nice? Do you still want it? Uncle has something even more beautiful. Let Uncle hug you and I’ll give you a lot of beautiful jewelry.”</p>
<p>However, Ya’er remained unmoved. She turned her head to the side as if she was impatient with him.</p>
<p>The corners of Yun Niu’s eyes twitched as he thought to himself, Alright, you ingrate. You’re turning your back on me after taking my stuff.</p>
<p>However, no matter how Yun Niu coaxed her, she ignored him.</p>
<p>“Yun Niu, it looks like you aren’t very popular with children. Stop teasing her,” Tian Xiangdong said.</p>
<p>“It looks like that’s the case.” Yun Niu nodded, but he suddenly reached out and forcefully picked up Ya’er.</p>
<p>“Yun Niu, don’t do that. You’ll scare Ya’er.” Fang Ruoxi frowned and was about to take Ya’er back.</p>
<p>Yun Niu took two steps back and with a poof, his body emitted white smoke. When the smoke dissipated, Yun Niu and Ya’er were gone.</p>
<p>“Tell Zhou Wen that if he wants this girl to live, he has to come to Mount Dragon Tiger alone.” A voice sounded, but there was no sign of him.</p>
<p>Fang Ruoxi and Tian Xiangdong’s expressions changed drastically as they quickly rushed out. However, there was no sign of Yun Niu or Ya’er.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen happened to walk over at this moment. Tian Xiangdong immediately said, “Zhou Wen, bad news. Ya’er has been abducted…”</p>
<p>Fang Ruoxi said anxiously, “Let’s chase after him. He shouldn’t have escaped the campus grounds yet.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to chase. We won’t be able to catch up. That person’s name is Yun Niu?” Zhou Wen had already seen the development. He was afraid that something would happen to Ya’er, so he kept using Truth Listener to monitor her.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen everything that had happened in the activity room. However, he never expected Yun Niu to suddenly pull off such a trick. Even he didn’t have the time to stop him.</p>
<p>“Yes, his name is Yun Niu. He’s a freshman. He just joined the club not long ago. I never expected… Zhou Wen, I’m sorry… I’ll go with you to Mount Dragon Tiger. No matter what, I have to save Ya’er.” Fang Ruoxi felt terrible. Zhou Wen had requested that she take care of Ya’er, but someone had abducted Ya’er under her nose.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. I know who took away Ya’er. It’s fine. Don’t blame yourself. Even the six families couldn’t stop him from stealing something, much less you,” Zhou Wen said.</p>

<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Liu Yun led Ya’er out of Luoyang and rode an eagle into the forest. Even if An Tianzuo personally gave the order to capture him, it was probably too late.</p>
<p>“Hehe, little girl, with you in my hands, I’m not afraid that bastard Zhou Wen won’t come to Mount Dragon Tiger.” Liu Yun glanced at Ya’er who was sitting beside him.</p>
<p>Ordinary children would cry from fright if they encountered such a situation. Yet, to his surprise, there was no expression on Ya’er’s face. It was as though nothing had happened. She was no different from before. She sat obediently on the eagle’s back. She wasn’t afraid of heights either.</p>
<p>Is she an idiot? Liu Yun felt that there was definitely something wrong with Ya’er’s brain.</p>
<p>How can a normal child be so calm? Not to mention a one-year-old child, even an eleven or twelve-year-old child would probably cry from fright.</p>
<p>“Come, give me the necklace. I’ll change it for you.” Seeing that Ya’er was a little silly, Liu Yun wasn’t in the mood to say anything to her. He reached out and wanted to take the necklace from her neck.</p>
<p>This necklace was extraordinary. It was a treasure of the Cape family. Although it wasn’t a dimensional item, it was very famous before the dimensional storms.</p>
<p>This necklace was known as Cupid’s Gift. Before the dimensional storms, the queens of several countries had worn it. It was a priceless treasure.</p>
<p>However, this necklace had another name. It was called “Widow Queen.” In the beginning, this necklace was a gift from a king to his queen. The king expressed his love for the queen and searched for the best ruby back then. After the forging and setting was done by a master artisan, Cupid’s Gift was created.</p>
<p>However, who knew that good times wouldn’t last long. Not long after giving away the necklace, the king died from illness, and the queen became a regent queen.</p>
<p>Later, the necklace switched hands a few more times. Many of its owners were queens, and they all lost their husbands.</p>
<p>When Liu Yun went to the Cape family to steal something, he accidentally discovered Cupid’s Gift and stole it.</p>
<p>Although this item wasn’t a dimensional item, many women liked it, especially those who were rich, powerful, and married. Many were willing to buy it at a high price.</p>
<p>Liu Yun knew that there was a rich lady of a local family who had been looking for this necklace for a long time. If he took it to her, he could exchange it for many resources.</p>
<p>Liu Yun originally planned on auctioning this necklace in the future, so he naturally couldn’t really give it to Ya’er.</p>
<p>When Liu Yun tried to take the necklace off, Ya’er naturally refused and retreated.</p>
<p>However, they were now sitting on the eagle’s back. Once Ya’er retreated, her body would fall.</p>
<p>Liu Yun hurriedly pulled her back, preventing her from falling.</p>
<p>Forget it. You can wear it for now, Liu Yun thought to himself. After all, Ya’er was in his hands and she couldn’t escape. It wouldn’t be too late to take it back when she was sick of wearing it. There was no need to force her to take it off.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, that bastard. You made me suffer so much the last time. I’ll teach you a lesson this time. Liu Yun had been planning this for a long time.</p>
<p>He had disguised himself as a student and sneaked into Sunset College. He had even joined the Xuanwen Club to think of a way to get Zhou Wen to Mount Dragon Tiger.</p>
<p>The Earth Elemental Beast was being auctioned at the Zhang family’s Mount Dragon Tiger. Liu Yun was also very interested in the Earth Elemental Beast, but he naturally wouldn’t use money to bid for it. He wanted to steal it before the auction.</p>
<p>Liu Yun had already made an attempt before, but ever since he had stolen from the Zhang family, the Zhang family had implemented measures against him. They nearly captured him alive.</p>
<p>Liu Yun knew that it wouldn’t be easy for him to steal the Earth Elemental Beast, so he planned on finding someone to help him. Therefore, he thought of Zhou Wen and planned on using Ya’er to force him to steal it.</p>
<p>That bastard caused me so much trouble the last time. I can’t let him have it easy this time. I’ll let him do all the dirty work. In the end, after I take the Earth Elemental Beast, I’ll disavow him… Liu Yun couldn’t help but laugh out loud when he thought of the smug look he would be wearing.</p>
<p>“Haha… Haha… Haha… Haha…” Liu Yun laughed heartily, but as he laughed, his expression turned ugly.</p>
<p>This was because he realized that he couldn’t stop laughing.</p>
<p>“I… Haha… I… Haha… What’s going on… Haha… What’s going on… Haha…” Liu Yun couldn’t stop laughing. His mouth was about to deform from laughing, but he couldn’t stop.</p>
<p>He covered his mouth with his hand, but he couldn’t stop himself from laughing. Instead, he looked even more wretched as though he was secretly laughing.</p>
<p>After a while, Liu Yun finally stopped laughing.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Could it be that Zhou Wen has something up his sleeve? He knows that I stole Ya’er, so he’s messing with me? Liu Yun checked his body but didn’t discover any curse-like powers.</p>
<p>There’s no curse. Could it be that I’m too happy? Liu Yun’s ring didn’t react so he couldn’t help but be puzzled.</p>
<p>Ever since he had succumbed to Zhou Wen’s move, Liu Yun had thought of many solutions to prevent himself from being cursed. He had obtained many Companion Beasts to resolve this problem, and this purification ring was one of them.</p>
<p>Although the purification ring couldn’t remove all curses, it would react if he suffered from one. It was very convenient to use it to detect curses.</p>
<p>Now that the purification ring didn’t react, it meant that Liu Yun wasn’t cursed.</p>
<p>Liu Yun carefully checked his body again and didn’t find any problems. He had stopped laughing.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it might be because I was too happy just now. Liu Yun thought for a moment and felt that it was plausible. He had seen people who couldn’t stop laughing.</p>
<p>“Hungry,” Ya’er suddenly said some time into the flight.</p>
<p>“So you can speak?” Liu Yun looked at Ya’er in surprise.</p>
<p>However, Ya’er didn’t say anything else. She only looked at Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll take you to eat when we reach the city ahead.” Liu Yun controlled the giant eagle and flew towards a nearby city.</p>
<p>After arriving in the city, Liu Yun took Ya’er window shopping.</p>
<p>Ya’er stopped in front of a dessert shop and pointed inside, indicating her desire to eat some desserts.</p>
<p>However, Liu Yun curled his lips and said, “What’s so good about these non-nutritious things? Furthermore, as a godly thief, how can I pay for food? I’ll let you have a free meal.”</p>
<p>Ya’er followed Liu Yun expressionlessly. This was what Liu Yun was most satisfied with. Although Ya’er was a little strange, she didn’t cry or make a fuss. It saved Liu Yun trouble.</p>
<p>After walking for a while, Liu Yun brought Ya’er to a hotel. The hotel looked rather high-end and was very lively.</p>
<p>However, there was one thing. At the entrance of the hotel, there were many flower wreaths and couplets. It was as if someone had died and they were having a funeral.</p>
<h3 id='chapter829'>Chapter 829: Don’t Hit The Face</h3>
<p>“Ya’er, here’s a life lesson. Nothing else is important in life, but when it comes to eating, never compromise; otherwise, you will have come to this world for nothing. Although this small city isn’t famous, its Eight Bowl Dish is very authentic. It’s difficult to find it elsewhere. Let’s head in to have some now.” Liu Yun led Ya’er inside.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the reception area at the entrance, he waved his hand like he was doing a magic trick, producing a white bag. He then swaggered inside with Ya’er.</p>
<p>The receptionists didn’t know him, but this place was huge. There were more than a hundred tables, so it was normal for there to be unfamiliar people. Soon, someone arranged for Liu Yun to sit down.</p>
<p>“There will be delicious food in a while. You will definitely suffer if you follow Zhou Wen. You haven’t eaten anything delicious. It’s different if you follow me. Be it the things on mountains, in the sea, or on land. you’ll have the best to eat. Just follow me obediently. I guarantee you that you won’t regret it,” Liu Yun whispered to Ya’er.</p>
<p>When the people beside him heard Liu Yun, although they didn’t know him, someone who was very friendly said, “Lad, from what you said, you’ve been to many places?”</p>
<p>“That’s for sure. I’m not bragging. I’ve basically visited all the cities in the Federation’s four districts, big and small.” Liu Yun was even better at conversations than him. In a while, he was having a good chat with the people at his table. At the same time, he figured out who was the one having the funeral.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it was obvious that the funeral wasn’t held by an ordinary family, but one of the most powerful families in the area. Three of the four brothers were at the Epic stage and were known as the Three Heroes of the Chen family. In such a small city, they could be considered top wealthy families.</p>
<p>Not long ago, their father had passed away. They were having the funeral for the father, and all the famous people in the area had come to pay their respects.</p>
<p>The deceased had many friends when he was alive, and he had good social relations. Many people came, and those who sat far away were sitting at the extra tables that were set up. Those who had invitations were all sitting in front.</p>
<p>Not long after, an emcee went on stage to speak.</p>
<p>“Dear friends and guests: Today, we are gathered here today in memory of our dear Old Master Chen…”</p>
<p>While the emcee was reading from his script with a sorrowful expression, everyone had solemn and sorrowful expressions. As they waited silently, they suddenly heard someone laugh. “Haha…”</p>
<p>Instantly, everyone’s eyes focused on the source of the laughter.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s face turned livid. He didn’t know why he had suddenly laughed. He didn’t want to laugh either. He covered his face with an innocent expression.</p>
<p>The eldest son of the Chen family gestured for the emcee to continue. At such a time, it was not suitable to cause trouble. Even if there was something, he had to wait until the funeral was over.</p>
<p>“Our dear Old Master Chen was generous and helpful. He was a good boss at the company, a good husband and father at home…”</p>
<p>“Haha…” Laughter sounded again. This time, everyone’s eyes quickly looked at the spot where Liu Yun was sitting. The eyes of the Chen family members were murderous.</p>
<p>Liu Yun felt like crying. He really didn’t want to laugh, but he couldn’t help it. It worked when he covered his mouth just now, but he couldn’t stop laughing despite doing so now. Instead, it made his expression look even more wretched, as though he was snickering while covering his mouth.</p>
<p>“Are you f** king here to cause trouble?” The three Chen brothers couldn’t tolerate it any longer. Their friends and family were also indignant. Instantly, hundreds of people in the hall stood up and surrounded Liu Yun. All of them had ugly expressions.</p>
<p>“I… Haha… I really don’t want to laugh… Haha… I… Haha…” Liu Yun laughed as he spoke. He really couldn’t control himself.</p>
<p>“Beat him to death.” The three Chen brothers were truly enraged. The others couldn’t stand it any longer and rushed forward to beat him.</p>
<p>“Ah!” A tragic cry sounded in the hall.</p>
<p>When Liu Yun escaped with a swollen face, he saw that Ya’er had followed him without him realizing it. They were outside the hotel.</p>
<p>Liu Yun picked up Ya’er and fled. There was a group of people shouting to have him killed behind him.</p>
<p>“Haha… Gosh… Haha… Don’t hit me in the face… These people don’t even know the rules… Haha… They know nothing…” After escaping the pursuit, Liu Yun was still laughing despite his swollen face. When he laughed, it even pulled at the injuries on his face, causing him to grimace in pain.</p>
<p>“What the hell. Why can’t I stop laughing?” As Liu Yun spoke, he realized that he wasn’t laughing. He was even more alarmed.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Liu Yun glanced at Ya’er and saw her pointing at a cake shop. “Hungry.”</p>
<p>How old is this brat? It’s impossible that it’s because of her. Could it be that I didn’t notice that I committed some taboo when I was in school? Liu Yun thought to himself.</p>
<p>Since he was already in this state, it was impossible for him to freeload. Liu Yun had no choice but to take Ya’er to the cake shop to buy some desserts for her.</p>
<p>As Ya’er ate, she looked at the injuries on Liu Yun’s face. Liu Yun took a bite of the cake and it tugged at the wound at the corner of his mouth. The corners of his mouth twitched in pain as he said gloomily, “What are you looking at? Don’t think that I’m not their match. I can kill them all with a flick of my finger, but I’m a professional and not a bandit. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>Ya’er lowered her head and continued eating the desserts. He did not know if she had understood him.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that Liu Yun had taken away Ya’er and was forcing him to go to Mount Dragon Tiger. He wasn’t worried that Liu Yun would harm Ya’er. Liu Yun wasn’t someone who would harm a child.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he was going to Mount Dragon Tiger anyway, so it was fine for him to head there early.</p>
<p>Liu Yun wants me to find him at Mount Dragon Tiger. From the looks of it, he has his sights on the Earth Elemental Beast. Zhou Wen was still somewhat worried. It wasn’t because he was worried about Ya’er, but because he was afraid that Liu Yun would be a dead person by the time he found him.</p>
<p>Liu Yun didn’t know Ya’er’s origins and only treated her as a child. He probably didn’t have his guard up against her, but Ya’er wasn’t a real child. Offending her would really kill him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t wrong. If Zhou Wen hadn’t set those rules for Ya’er, Liu Yun would have been in a terrible situation if Ya’er hadn’t obeyed.</p>
<p>Even if Ya’er didn’t want to kill anyone, Liu Yun’s situation was equally bad.</p>
<p>Liu Yun originally thought that he could easily rush to Mount Dragon Tiger and wait for Zhou Wen to arrive, but to his dismay, the journey wasn’t easy at all.</p>
<p>Failing to freeload the previous time, Liu Yun was indignant. After arriving in another city, Liu Yun planned on freeloading at another banquet.</p>
<p>Liu Yun thought to himself, My bad habit of suddenly laughing should be fine at a wedding banquet. Even if it flares up, people will just think that I’m happy.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s idea was pretty good, but at the wedding banquet, just as the bride and groom were about to exchange rings, Liu Yun suddenly couldn’t help but cry out loud. He cried so sadly that those who didn’t know would think that there was something between him and the bride and that he couldn’t bear to let the bride get married.</p>
<p>Instantly, everyone’s eyes focused on Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“Boohoo… I… I really don’t want to cry… Boohoo… Don’t hit my face…”</p>
<h3 id='chapter830'>Chapter 830: Dragon Tiger Town</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen set off for Mount Dragon Tiger, wanting to know what Liu Yun was up to.</p>
<p>After walking for a while, Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised to discover that the Fine Dust Life Soul was growing.</p>
<p>What happened? Why would the Fine Dust Life Soul grow on its own? Zhou Wen didn’t know what he had done to make it grow.</p>
<p>After some thought, he narrowed it down to one possibility. When he walked, he triggered Fine Dust’s growth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly experimented again and realized that it was true. The further he went, the faster Fine Dust grew. When he didn’t walk, Fine Dust would stop growing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was useless to take a repetitive path. He had to go to places he had never been before. Only then would Fine Dust obtain the energy needed to grow.</p>
<p>The advancement method of the Fine Dust Life Soul is quite interesting. I can actually grow it by walking. This is very easy. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be delighted. He could evolve it simply by walking. The Fine Dust Life Soul could be considered the easiest to advance.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“If this continues, I might be able to advance to an Evolved Body by the time I reach Mount Dragon Tiger.”</p>
<p>As he had something on his mind, Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to visit the dimensional zones on the way. He headed straight for Mount Dragon Tiger without stopping.</p>
<p>Before the dimensional storms, Mount Dragon Tiger was a Daoist sacred land. The founder of the orthodox path, Perfected Orthodox Unity, cultivated and did alchemy on Mount Dragon Tiger.</p>
<p>Legend had it that the Zhang family was the descendant of Perfected Orthodox Unity. After Mount Dragon Tiger became a dimensional zone, the Zhang family, who had always lived there, naturally became the owner of Mount Dragon Tiger.</p>
<p>It was said that after the mutation at Mount Dragon Tiger, there were dragon and tiger roars coming from within. It was a terrifying place. Apart from the Zhang family, no one usually dared to approach it.</p>
<p>The Zhang family was good at alchemy and Sword Seal Talismans. It was said that not only did they benefit from dimensional zones, but they also had the legacy of Orthodox Unity.</p>
<p>The Hero King’s rise to prominence back then was definitely not due to luck. Orthodox Unity’s legacy was indispensable.</p>
<p>Although the Hero King was very famous, the Zhang family was relatively low-key among the six families. They weren’t as arrogant as the Cape family, nor did they seize power like the Xia family. They only guarded the area near Mount Dragon Tiger and rumors about the Zhang family were rare.</p>
<p>However, no one dared to underestimate the Zhang family because of this. In fact, there were many times when the other five families needed the Zhang family’s help.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Zhang family controlled the most important servers in the Federation. Much information and data had to go through the Zhang family before they could retrieve it.</p>
<p>With the Zhang family’s way of doing things, it wasn’t easy to get information from them. To get them to do something wasn’t something that could be done with a small sum of money.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen rushed all the way to the vicinity of Mount Dragon Tiger and had no choice but to marvel at the wonderland. It was a perfect paradise. The scenery was picturesque and the fog filled the air like a paradise on earth.</p>
<p>Legend has it that back when Celestial Master Zhang was refining pills on Mount Dragon Tiger, a dragon and tiger appeared after the pill was formed. That’s why it was named Mount Dragon Tiger. I wonder if the current Mount Dragon Tiger also has a Dragon Tiger Pill? Zhou Wen was very interested in the Mount Dragon Tiger dimensional zone.</p>
<p>The Zhang family had been guarding Mount Dragon Tiger all this time and had even built this place to be the headquarters of the Zhang family. Outsiders were not allowed to enter, so Mount Dragon Tiger was definitely no trifling matter. If he could download it as a game dungeon, there might be great benefits awaiting him.</p>
<p>However, the auction wasn’t to be held in the Dragon Tiger dimensional zone. Instead, it was going to be held in a small town outside the mountain. The town’s name was Dragon Tiger Town.</p>
<p>Although it was called a town, Dragon Tiger Town was comparable to a large city.</p>
<p>Due to the Zhang family’s existence, many people moved their families to the vicinity of Mount Dragon Tiger, causing the nearby town to expand greatly. The Zhang family also protected the peace in the vicinity, preventing them from being ravaged by dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen arrived at Dragon Tiger Town, he originally imagined that Liu Yun would take the initiative to contact him, but to his surprise, Liu Yun was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Little did he know that although Liu Yun had left early, he had encountered many things on the way. He had traveled very slowly, allowing Zhou Wen to arrive at Dragon Tiger Town first.</p>
<p>Could Liu Yun be dead? Zhou Wen was somewhat worried, but there was nothing he could do. All he could do was wait.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t contact Zhang Yuzhi because he didn’t know what Liu Yun was up to. If Liu Yun wanted to force him to go to the Zhang family to steal the Earth Elemental Beast, it wouldn’t be appropriate for Zhou Wen to stay at the Zhang family’s residence.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to find a hotel to stay in, he saw a group of people walking across the street. From their looks, they were likely from the West District.</p>
<p>People from the Family Clan of Gods? Zhou Wen carefully sized them up and recognized the logo on them.</p>
<p>Although the members of the Family Clan of Gods only had surnames and no names, they would usually use a symbol to let others know that they were members of the Family Clan of Gods. They would also be proud of being members of the Family Clan of Gods.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that the middle-aged man in the lead was tall and handsome. His figure and facial lines were as angular as a marble statue. It was unforgettable.</p>
<p>As though sensing Zhou Wen’s gaze, the person looked over as well. He clearly recognized Zhou Wen. After taking a glance, he walked over.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man came in front of Zhou Wen and said with a smile, “Hello, Zhou Wen. My name is Moses and I’m a member of the Family Clan of Gods. I’ve wanted to meet you for a long time, but I couldn’t find time to go to Luoyang. To be able to meet you here, it looks like we are destined to meet.”</p>
<p>The other members of the Family Clan of Gods also stared at Zhou Wen as they sized him up. Clearly, they were rather curious about him.</p>
<p>A young man who wasn’t from the six families and didn’t even have a decent family background was actually able to make such a name for himself in the Federation. This was very eye-catching.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen was Wang Mingyuan’s disciple. Just this alone was enough to raise an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“How may I help you?” Zhou Wen asked Moses.</p>
<p>His relationship with the six families wasn’t too good. After all, the six families were the actual rulers of the Federation, but he had challenged the authority of the Federation. It would be strange if their relationship was good.</p>
<p>“If possible, I hope to have a fair battle with you,” said Moses.</p>
<p>“Moses, aren’t you being a disgrace? You actually want to challenge a young man.” As he spoke, Zhang Chunqiu walked over.</p>
<p>This was Mount Dragon Tiger. It would have been odd if the Zhang family did not know that figures like Zhou Wen and Moses had come to Dragon Tiger Town.</p>
<p>Moses smiled and said, “The rules of the Family Clan of Gods are different from your East District. The strong are respected. Zhou Wen is strong enough to be my opponent.”</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu said with a smile, “Then you can challenge Zhou Wen when he goes to your Family Clan of Gods. He’s our guest now.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter831'>Chapter 831: Fiend Tomb</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“I’ll naturally follow our host’s arrangements,” Moses said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu bowed slightly and said, “I’ve already prepared a place for you to stay. Zhang Xiao will take you there. I hope you don’t mind.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Moses said.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiao took Moses and company to their residence. Before he left, he glared fiercely at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found it baffling. Although he had taken Zhang Yuzhi out on a trip the last time, he had ultimately sent her back safely. Was there a need to hold a grudge?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know that his Tyrant Behemoth had actually been lost by the Zhang family. Zhang Xiao already knew that Tyrant Behemoth was his and wasn’t angry with him because of Zhang Yuzhi.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, come with me. Celestial Master Manor has already prepared a guest room. Yuzhi is waiting for you there,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally didn’t wish to head to the Zhang family so early, but since Zhang Chunqiu was already here, he had no choice but to make a trip.</p>
<p>The Celestial Master Manor was situated beside a mountain and a river. It was an excellent place. The Zhang family had lived here for generations. They were good at geomancy so they naturally chose the right place.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Celestial Master Manor, Zhou Wen thought of a legend regarding Celestial Master Zhang.</p>
<p>Legend had it that Celestial Master Zhang’s father was a geomancy expert. He had found an excellent cave with great traits according to geomancy for his father and wanted to bury him there.</p>
<p>The cave was located along an Emperor Dragon vein. This implied that there would definitely be an emperor among his descendants in the future.</p>
<p>However, during the burial, a burly man who was carrying the coffin couldn’t hold back his bladder. He ran nearby and peed. He happened to pee on the dragon vein. A bolt from the blue sounded; dissipating the dragon aura and eliminating the possibility of a human emperor.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Celestial Master Zhang’s father sighed at the Zhang family’s lack of fortune, but he didn’t blame the burly man. He still buried his father in the cave and left a message saying that the cave had lost its dragon aura, but the layout was still fine. The Zhang family would definitely produce a master in the future.</p>
<p>Indeed, his son, Zhang Daoling, eventually became Celestial Master of the Orthodox Unity. He wasn’t just a master, but an immortal-like figure back then.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu led Zhou Wen into Celestial Master Manor and led him into the main hall.</p>
<p>“Where’s Yuzhi?” Zhou Wen asked when he didn’t see Zhang Yuzhi.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu said, “I’ve already gotten someone to call her over. She should be here soon. There’s no rush. Let’s have a chat first.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, There’s nothing to chat about between us. I don’t know you at all, right?</p>
<p>However, Zhang Chunqiu said, “That Tyrant Behemoth is your Companion Beast, right?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He didn’t know how Zhang Chunqiu knew, but he had no intention of denying it. He looked at Zhang Chunqiu and said, “Why are you suddenly asking about this?”</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu said, “Tyrant Behemoth was originally a Companion Egg from the West District. An elder of our Zhang family went to the West District to cultivate and obtained a Tyrant Behemoth Companion Beast in a dimensional zone named Genesis Garden. He originally planned on leaving it for talented juniors to use, but to his surprise, a spy appeared among us. He ingeniously did a swap and brought it out of Celestial Master Manor.”</p>
<p>“Our Behemoth shouldn’t be the same one, right?” Zhou Wen naturally didn’t admit it. He didn’t know if Zhang Chunqiu was telling the truth. Even if it was, Zhou Wen couldn’t return Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. Since it has been lost, it means that Tyrant Behemoth isn’t fated with our Zhang family. Furthermore, you have already hatched it, so we won’t make things difficult for you by asking you to return it.” Zhang Chunqiu continued, “Behemoth is unique. It wasn’t obtained by killing a dimensional creature, but from an opportunity. It’s impossible for there to be a second one. We don’t plan on getting it back either. We just want to know how you obtained the Companion Egg so that we can know how it was swapped. That way, we can be on guard in the future.”</p>
<p>“I got it at an auction. I originally thought it was a Minotaur, I never expected it to be a Behemoth.” Zhou Wen recounted the process of obtaining Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>“So that’s how it was. I know how the Behemoth Companion Egg was swapped and taken out. Zhou Wen, you are indeed someone with great luck. The other party must have been prepared to bid for the Behemoth Companion Egg, but it ended up being intercepted by you. There must have been an accident, but we just aren’t aware of it.” Zhang Chunqiu really had no intention of pursuing the matter.</p>
<p>“If it’s possible, can I ask you to help our Zhang family with Tyrant Behemoth? Of course, we won’t scrimp on compensation. The spirit talismans created by our Celestial Master Manor are still rather useful. I’ll use a Life Reversing Spirit Talisman as payment. What do you think?” Zhang Chunqiu continued.</p>
<p>“What do you want me to do?” Zhou Wen looked at Zhang Chunqiu in puzzlement.</p>
<p>He had heard of the Life Reversing Spirit Talisman before. Furthermore, he had heard of it from Liu Yun. A while ago, Liu Yun had used the Zhang family’s Life Reversing Spirit Talisman to steal his Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. It was obvious that the spirit talisman was quite impressive.</p>
<p>If the Zhang family was willing to offer such a good item as a reward, it would definitely not be an easy task.</p>
<p>“Have you heard of the Fiend Tomb?” Zhang Chunqiu asked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head. He had never heard of it.</p>
<p>“It’s not your fault. Few outsiders know about the Fiend Tomb. Over the years, our Zhang family has been guarding the Fiend Tomb and suppressing the dimensional creatures inside, preventing them from rushing out. We paid a huge price for this. It’s unimaginable to outsiders,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a serious expression.</p>
<p>“What kind of place is Fiend Tomb?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Have you heard of the story of my Zhang family, the one about the search for a special cave to bury a father?” Zhang Chunqiu didn’t answer and instead asked.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of it. I heard that the grandfather of the Celestial Master of the Orthodox Unity found a treasure cave for the burial. The extraordinary Celestial Master of the Orthodox Unity was a result of this geomancy augmentation,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu nodded. “That’s probably what the rumors say. Do you think they’re reliable?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know much about this.” It wasn’t appropriate for Zhou Wen to say that he believed it, nor did he say that he didn’t.</p>
<p>If he said that he believed it, it would be as though he was saying that the Zhang family relied on luck. If he said that he didn’t believe it, wouldn’t it mean that the Zhang family was lying? They didn’t obtain any mandate at all.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu smiled and didn’t say if the legend was true. He only said, “That cave is where the Fiend Tomb is.”</p>
<p>“Ah!” Zhou Wen widened his eyes as he looked at Zhang Chunqiu in disbelief.</p>
<p>The legendary cave that could give birth to an emperor and produce a Celestial Master was actually the Fiend Tomb that Zhang Chunqiu mentioned. It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>“Under the influence of the dimensional storms, the anomaly in the already extraordinary Fiend Tomb worsened. Our Zhang family has tried everything we can to deal with the Fiend Tomb, but the situation has only worsened. If possible, I hope you can use Tyrant Behemoth to help us temporarily suppress it.” Zhang Chunqiu explained what he needed Zhou Wen to do in detail.</p>
<h3 id='chapter832'>Chapter 832: Pill Essences</h3>

<p>He originally imagined that the Zhang family needed him to do something very dangerous, but after hearing this, he realized that there was no need for him to fight. They mainly needed Tyrant Behemoth’s strength.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the Fiend Tomb, there was a type of Fiend Stone that could keep growing. Wherever the Fiend Stone grew, the creatures in the Fiend Tomb could reach it. It was equivalent to a break out.</p>
<p>Dealing with Fiend Stones was very troublesome. One couldn’t shatter them, much less place them anywhere. This was because even if Fiend Stones were shattered into powder, they would continue to grow as though they were alive.</p>
<p>Shattering Fiend Stones or taking them elsewhere would only make them occupy more places.</p>
<p>These Fiend Stones didn’t pose much of a threat, but wherever it was, the creatures in the Fiend Tomb could pass through.</p>
<p>Of course, this was only one of the problems with the Fiend Tomb. Zhou Wen wasn’t from the Zhang family after all, so he wasn’t briefed about the Fiend Tomb’s other problems. All he needed to do was control Tyrant Behemoth to have it eat the additional Fiend Stones.</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, I naturally won’t shirk my duty. However, we still have to see if Behemoth will eat those Fiend Stones when the time comes. If it doesn’t, there’s nothing we can do,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Of course. I’m just afraid that it won’t be able to finish all the Fiend Stones.” Zhang Chunqiu was in a better mood when he saw Zhou Wen agree.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t worried about that. He had seen Behemoth’s appetite before, so eating a small mountain wasn’t a problem.</p>
<p>The two of them chatted for a while before Zhang Yuzhi walked in. She was very happy to see Zhou Wen. After all, she seldom had friends visiting her.</p>
<p>In fact, even if someone wanted to look for her, they probably wouldn’t be able to enter Celestial Master Manor. Even Moses, who was a member of the six families, had to stay in a courtyard instead of Celestial Master Manor.</p>
<p>“There are many interesting things about Mount Dragon Tiger. Let Yuzhi take you around.” Zhang Chunqiu bade farewell and left.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi led Zhou Wen out of the Celestial Master Manor and as they walked, said , “You must have been to many dimensional zones, but we have a dimensional creature here that you definitely haven’t seen elsewhere.”</p>
<p>“What dimensional creature is it?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>“You’ll know when we get there.” Zhang Yuzhi acted all mysterious and refused to explain.</p>
<p>She took Zhou Wen on a boat and they drifted down a river. The scenery on both sides of the river was like a fairyland. There were no ferocious dimensional creatures to be seen. It was no wonder the Zhang family could live here.</p>
<p>If there were dimensional creatures everywhere, it would probably be difficult for the Zhang family to live in peace.</p>
<p>Not long after the boat set off, Zhou Wen saw red rocks that made the area appear to have a red bed with steep cliffs along its sides. And in between the mountains and rivers was a strange hill.</p>
<p>The hill was situated alone in the water, revealing itself over the surface of the water. It looked like a huge pill furnace, and the red color suited the scenery.</p>
<p>“The dimensional creature is over there,” Zhang Yuzhi said as she pointed at the hill.</p>
<p>“You mean that hill is a dimensional creature?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Just wait and see,” Zhang Yuzhi said as she summoned a bow and shot an arrow at the hill.</p>
<p>When the arrow flew to the cauldron-like hill, it spewed out a beam of light. A red pill flew out and struck the arrow, shattering it.</p>
<p>The pill circled the hill a few times before charging at Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>“It’s very difficult for you to see the pill essences from Pill Furnace Mountain elsewhere. This red color is at the Legendary stage, while the golden one is at the Epic stage. If you can see a pill essence with dragon patterns or tiger patterns, it will be at the Mythical stage. However, they are very rare.” As Zhang Yuzhi spoke, she reached out and grabbed the red pill essence. No matter how it struggled, it couldn’t escape.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi had no intention of killing it. She touched it with her hand and the pill essence calmed down. It obediently stayed in her palm. Even when Zhang Yuzhi released her grip, it didn’t escape.</p>
<p>“What’s the use of these pill essence Companion Beasts? Can they treat injuries?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Some pill essences have healing abilities, but different pill essences have different abilities. For example, Poison Avoidance Pill Essence can detoxify, Rejuvenation Pill Essence can treat injuries, and some pill essences have poison-elemental abilities. They are all different.”</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi pointed at the pill essence hill and continued, “If you’re interested, you can give it a try. If you can find a Mythical Rejuvenation Pill Essence or Resurrection Pill Essences, that would be awesome.”</p>
<p>“What uses do they have?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“How stupid. You can tell from the name. Any one of them has the ability to revive the nearly dead. No matter how serious their injuries are, as long as they still have a breath left, they can be saved,” Zhang Yuzhi said.</p>
<p>“Is it that powerful?” Zhou Wen was somewhat tempted.</p>
<p>“Of course it’s powerful. However, pill essence Companion Beasts are single-use. They are gone after being used. Our Zhang family didn’t obtain many of them. It’s rare to see pill essences of such stages pass through a spatial rift, so to see it requires some luck,” Zhang Yuzhi said.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll try my luck. Perhaps I’ll be lucky.” Zhou Wen was interested and asked Zhang Yuzhi what to do.</p>
<p>“The pill essences that come through the dimensional rift are all in Pill Furnace Mountain. You just need to lure them out. It’s not complicated. Just make some noise. However, don’t keep your hopes up. It’s rare to see a Mythical pill essence,” Zhang Yuzhi said.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen summoned a Poison Bat and made it fly towards Pill Furnace Mountain.</p>
<p>Indeed, just as the Poison Bat approached the Pill Furnace Mountain, it alarmed the pill essences inside. Another pill essence flew out. It was also a pill essence that was as red as fire. It looked like it was at the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>The pill essence’s combat strength was lacking. It could only emit Pill Aura attacks that were similar to Essence Energy waves. Its might wasn’t very strong either, so it was instantly shattered by the Poison Bat.</p>
<p>The Poison Bat circled around the Pill Furnace Mountain for quite some time, causing pill essences to fly out one after another. However, most of them were at the Legendary stage. Even Epic ones were rare, much less Mythical ones.</p>
<p>Despite finally killing an Epic pill essence, nothing dropped.</p>
<p>“Haha, it looks like you are also down on your luck. Not even a Legendary Companion Beast dropped much less a Mythical pill essence,” Zhang Yuzhi said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat indignant as he used Truth Listener’s ability to see if there were any Mythical pill essences in Pill Furnace Mountain.</p>
<p>However, after giving it a try, he realized that Truth Listener’s hearing couldn’t penetrate deep into Pill Furnace Mountain. Inside Pill Furnace Mountain was an independent dimensional zone.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, this Mount Dragon Tiger is similar to Dragon Gate Grotto. It’s a dimensional zone formed by many small dimensional zones. Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he wanted to see if he could find the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>If he could download the Dragon Tiger Mountain dungeon, he wouldn’t have to worry in the future. He could slowly grind for Mythical pill essences.</p>
<h3 id='chapter833'>Chapter 833: Free Labor</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Although the Chaos Egg was useful, it could only be used by himself and not others.</p>
<p>If his family and friends were seriously injured, the pill essences were far more useful than the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sized up Pill Furnace Mountain and couldn’t help but be delighted. There was a tiny palm symbol on the rocks.</p>
<p>There really is one! Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he looked at Zhang Yuzhi and asked, “Can I take a picture closer to Pill Furnace Mountain?”</p>
<p>“Definitely not for outsiders. However, just be quick. Don’t let others see you do it,” Zhang Yuzhi said as she blinked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly took out his phone and flew towards Pill Furnace Mountain. When he reached a distance that his phone could sense it, he snapped a picture of the tiny palm symbol and immediately the download screen appeared.</p>
<p>“Do you still want to continue trying your luck?” Zhang Yuzhi asked when she saw Zhou Wen return to the boat.</p>
<p>“My luck isn’t that good. Forget it. Let’s go somewhere else to take a look.” Zhou Wen thought of searching elsewhere. Perhaps he could find other dungeons.</p>
<p>After downloading Pill Furnace Mountain, Zhou Wen realized that it was only the Pill Furnace Mountain instance dungeon and not the entire Mount Dragon Tiger instance dungeon.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, this is different from Dragon Gate Grotto. I can’t download the entire dimensional zone at once. Zhou Wen followed Zhang Yuzhi and browsed through several important dimensional zones near Mount Dragon Tiger.</p>
<p>However, to Zhou Wen’s disappointment, apart from the Pill Furnace Mountain, he didn’t find the tiny palm symbol anywhere near the other dimensional zones.</p>
<p>However, having Pill Furnace Mountain is enough. After all, these pill essences are rare elsewhere.</p>
<p>“By the way, I heard that Earth Elemental Beast is very precious. Why is your family willing to auction it?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi hesitated for a moment before saying, “The Earth Elemental Beast is indeed very precious. It’s very likely that there’s only one in the world. It’s impossible for there to be a second one. However, this Earth Elemental Beast was obtained through the efforts of the six heroes back then. Due to the unhappiness caused by it, my great-grandfather didn’t hatch it, nor did he let any of his descendants hatch it. Because of this, he’s auctioning it off. I’m not too sure about the details.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Zhang Yuzhi continued, “I know that the other five families want it very much, so the price will be very high. I’m afraid you won’t have a chance.”</p>
<p>“Then why did you get me to come here to bid for it?” Zhou Wen said gloomily.</p>
<p>“Can’t you just treat it as a vacation and to visit a friend?” Zhang Yuzhi smiled.</p>
<p>The two of them walked on the mountain path. Just as they were talking, they saw a huge immortal crane fly over from the mountains. On the back of the immortal crane was a youth with a cold expression.</p>
<p>“Brother, why are you here?” Zhang Yuzhi said when she saw that it was Zhang Xiao.</p>
<p>“I have something to discuss with Zhou Wen.” When Zhang Xiao spoke to Zhang Yuzhi, his tone was very gentle, but when he turned to Zhou Wen, his tone immediately turned stiff. “Zhou Wen, do you know that Tyrant Behemoth originally belonged to our Zhang family?”</p>
<p>“So?” Zhou Wen asked Zhang Xiao.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiao was slightly taken aback and was momentarily at a loss for words. Zhou Wen had already hatched Tyrant Behemoth and fed it until it had advanced to the Mythical stage. It was clearly unrealistic for Zhou Wen to return Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>The reason Zhang Xiao had come was because he was furious. He didn’t plan on doing anything to Zhou Wen. If Zhou Wen were to take a softer stance, Zhang Xiao’s anger would have dissipated.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t someone who would take a soft stance. The moment he shot back his retort, the two of them entered a frozen deadlock.</p>
<p>“Brother, forget it. You can’t blame Zhou Wen for this.” Zhang Yuzhi also spoke up for Zhou Wen, leaving Zhang Xiao even more depressed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said, “How about this? Please help me feed Tyrant Behemoth. I won’t ask for any payment during this period of feeding. Just treat it as free labor for you.”</p>
<p>“What if I keep feeding it?” Zhang Xiao asked coldly.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll let it continue working for your Zhang family for free.” Zhou Wen paused before saying, “However, I have a condition. You have to feed it until it’s full. You can’t let it starve. Furthermore, you have to feed it until I leave Mount Dragon Tiger.”</p>
<p>“That’s more like it. Then it’s settled. Summon Tyrant Behemoth. I’ll feed it now,” Zhang Xiao said to Zhou Wen, afraid that he would go back on his word.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth and got it to follow Zhang Xiao.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to do this,” Zhang Yuzhi said apologetically.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. If he’d like to raise it, let him try it.” Zhou Wen felt pity for Zhang Xiao when he saw him leave excitedly with Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth was indeed powerful. It even had a chance of advancing in the future. Others only saw its strength, but they didn’t know how much food it consumed every day.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for the fact that there was an endless Essence Crystal mine in-game, Tyrant Behemoth would have long starved to death. Zhou Wen knew very well how much one had to pay to feed it in real life. Ordinary people couldn’t afford such a price.</p>
<p>Since Zhang Xiao wanted to feed Tyrant Behemoth, there was no need for Zhou Wen to stop him.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiao happily took Tyrant Behemoth back. As long as he fed Tyrant Behemoth, he could use it for free. Where could he get such a deal?</p>
<p>Zhang Xiao was secretly delighted. If Zhou Wen goes back on his word, he won’t have to be shamed even if I don’t disparage him. If he doesn’t go back on his word, I’ll keep feeding Tyrant Behemoth until Zhou Wen dies. I won’t return him no matter what.</p>
<p>“Zhang Xiao, what’s going on?” Zhang Chunqiu asked in puzzlement when he saw Zhang Xiao bring Tyrant Behemoth over.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiao recounted the matter proudly. “Zhou Wen knows that he’s in the wrong, so he lent it to us for free. There’s no need to give him the Life Reversing Spirit Talisman now.”</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu frowned when he heard that. He sized up the three to four-meter-tall Tyrant Behemoth and said, “I don’t think it’s that simple. That Zhou Wen isn’t such a thin-skinned person. Why would he be so kind as to lend us Tyrant Behemoth for free?”</p>
<p>“Tyrant Behemoth is here. If he goes back on his word, he will be embarrassing himself,” Zhang Xiao said.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Chunqiu didn’t think so. After some thought, he said, “Legend has it that Tyrant Behemoth eats mountains daily. Although the legend might be a little exaggerated, Tyrant Behemoth is definitely a glutton. Did you ask Zhou Wen what Tyrant Behemoth eats?”</p>
<p>“I did. He said that it eats Essence Crystals, Essence Gold, and anything else that contains Essence Energy. So what if it can eat? Aren’t we letting Tyrant Behemoth eat Fiend Stones? This is equivalent to free labor,” Zhang Xiao said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Perhaps.” Zhang Chunqiu had a nagging feeling that Zhou Wen wasn’t such a nice person.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter834'>Chapter 834: Pill Furnace Mountain Dungeon</h3>
<p>Despite hanging out with Zhang Yuzhi for a day, Zhou Wen only managed to go to a few famous places as Mount Dragon Tiger was just so huge. There were just too many dimensional zones.</p>
<p>After returning, Zhang Yuzhi arranged a place for Zhou Wen to stay in Celestial Master Manor. Zhou Wen lay in bed and took out his phone, hoping to see if he could get a pill essence to drop in Pill Furnace Mountain in-game.</p>
<p>When he launched the game, the scene he saw was the entire Pill Furnace Mountain. He controlled the blood-colored avatar to come to the top of Pill Furnace Mountain and saw nine bowl-sized holes.</p>
<p>When he approached Pill Furnace Mountain, a pill essence immediately spewed out from one of the holes. It was a scarlet pill essence, undoubtedly at the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Overlord Sword and allowed it to slay the pill essence before landing on the mountaintop.</p>
<p>The nine holes immediately spewed out pill essences—red and yellow ones—but they were no match for the Golden Overlord Sword. They were shattered the moment they appeared.</p>
<p>‘Killed Legendary creature, Venom Pill Essence… Killed Epic creature, Rejuvenation Pill Essence…’</p>
<p>Although they looked similar on the surface, the pill essences had slight differences.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>With a crisp sound, a Companion Egg finally dropped. On careful look, it was a golden pill with the words “Rejuvenation Pill Essence.”</p>
<p>An Epic Rejuvenation Pill! Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be overjoyed. Although this wasn’t as good as the Resurrection Pill, he had heard from Zhang Yuzhi that the Rejuvenation Pill’s healing effects were very good. They were extremely effective treating typical internal organ, flesh, and bone injuries.</p>
<p>He hatched the Rejuvenation Pill and checked its stats.</p>
<p>Rejuvenation Pill Essence: Epic</p>
<p>Life Providence: Land Rejuvenation</p>
<p>Life Soul: Pill Spirit</p>
<p>Strength: 21</p>
<p>Speed: 21</p>
<p>Constitution: 22</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 39</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Miraculous Rejuvenation</p>
<p>Companion Form: Pill (One-time use)</p>
<p>These stats are quite odd. However, Zhang Yuzhi said that the other stats don’t matter. The quality of a pill essence depends on its Essence Energy. A pill essence with high Essence Energy has stronger effects. This has 39 Essence Energy. It’s considered excellent, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>The Golden Overlord Sword was still killing the pill essences. All sorts of pill essences spewed out from the nine holes as they were killed by the Golden Overlord Sword.</p>
<p>These pill essences were odd. Apart from Companion Eggs, nothing else dropped. Zhou Wen didn’t even see a single stat crystal. Instead, two more Legendary Companion Eggs dropped.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a white pill essence flew out from the hole. It was about the size of a fist and was crystalline like a ball of jade with misty clouds inside.</p>
<p>What was even stranger was the white dragon-shaped mist flowing in the pill. The entire pill essence emitted an abnormally powerful lifeforce.</p>
<p>A pill essence with a dragon form? Could it be the Mythical Resurrection Pill Essence that Zhang Yuzhi mentioned? Zhou Wen was delighted as he immediately ordered the Golden Overlord Sword to slash at it.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The Golden Overlord Sword slashed at the Resurrection Pill Essence, but it failed to split it into two. It only left a sword mark.</p>
<p>Almost instantly, the wounds on the Resurrection Pill Essence healed.</p>
<p>The Golden Overlord Sword slashed several times, each strike leaving a deep mark on its body. However, it failed to slice through it fully. In the next instant, the Resurrection Pill Essence would recover.</p>
<p>The Rejuvenation Pill Essence’s recovery ability is so strong. It’s even stronger than Li Xuan’s recovery ability. Zhou Wen was secretly surprised.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Tyrant Behemoth was still with Zhang Xiao and couldn’t be used. Zhou Wen had to unsummon it to have it projected in-game.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen naturally couldn’t take it back, so he had no choice but to let the blood-colored avatar hold the Golden Overlord Sword and use Immortal Slaying.</p>
<p>The Golden Overlord Sword combined with Immortal Slaying cleaved the Life Regeneration Pill Essence into two at once.</p>
<p>‘Killed Mythical Creature, Rejuvenation Pill Essence.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was taken aback when he saw the game notification. That’s it?</p>
<p>It was the first kill of a Mythical creature in this dungeon, but nothing dropped—not even a single strand of hair.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed, he didn’t mind as there were plenty of opportunities in the future. He continued letting the Golden Overlord Sword kill the pill essences.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>After killing a Legendary pill essence, a Companion Egg dropped. Zhou Wen took a careful look and realized that it was called a Virility Strengthening Pill.</p>
<p>There’s actually such a pill essence! Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. After incubating the Virility Strengthening Pill, he realized that its stats were ordinary. However, its talent skill was different from the Rejuvenation Pill. Its name was “Virility Strengthening.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept counting. There were only eighty-one pill essences in Pill Furnace Mountain. After killing them, no more pill essences came out.</p>
<p>Apart from the Resurrection Pill Essence, no other Mythical pill essence appeared.</p>
<p>He dripped his blood to respawn in the dungeon, but the pill essences on Pill Furnace Mountain didn’t respawn.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the respawning pattern of this Pill Furnace Mountain should be the same as other Mythical creatures. It respawns once every 24 hours. Zhou Wen had no choice but to give up on grinding pill essences and switch to grinding other Mythical creatures and rare dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>After killing the Golden Battle God Halberd again, another Companion Egg dropped.</p>
<p>This thing has such a high drop rate! Is this the fourth or fifth? Zhou Wen couldn’t remember how many times it had dropped.</p>
<p>What’s the point of dropping so many? Quickly have the nine black dragons’ Companion Beast drop. Let me see what effects they have. Zhou Wen suddenly thought of something.</p>
<p>Previously, Liu Yun could transfer his Companion Beast to others by paying a small price. Now that I’ve also practiced the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art, can I be like him? If I can do it, won’t I be able to sell those useless Companion Beasts? Zhou Wen really wanted to sell his Companion Beasts in exchange for the resources he needed.</p>
<p>Even if he didn’t sell them, he could give the Companion Beasts he had no use for to his close friends to ensure their safety.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen still didn’t understand how to use the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art to transfer Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>I’ll think of a way to get the method from Liu Yun. Is this fellow here or not? As Liu Yun couldn’t enter Celestial Master Manor, Zhou Wen planned on visiting Dragon Tiger Town tomorrow to prevent Liu Yun from failing to find him.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen slept, Zhang Xiao didn’t sleep. He was reeling in excitement. He led Tyrant Behemoth to the Fiend Tomb today to see if Tyrant Behemoth would eat the Fiend Stones.</p>
<p>The outcome excited him. Not only did Tyrant Behemoth eat them, but it also ate at an astonishing speed. In less than half a day, it had already eaten a large number of Fiend Stones.</p>
<p>At this rate, it will only take five days at most. The Fiend Stones that spread out from the Fiend Tomb will probably be eaten clean. Considering how much it has eaten, it definitely won’t digest it all so easily. Considering the digestion time, it will probably take more than a month to resolve the problem of Fiend Stone growth… Zhang Xiao thought excitedly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter835'>Chapter 835: The Insatiable Behemoth</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhang Xiao wasn’t wrong. Unfortunately, he had underestimated Tyrant Behemoth’s appetite. He originally imagined that after the first day, Tyrant Behemoth would definitely need a few days to rest and digest.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Tyrant Behemoth didn’t have any intention of resting every two days. It continued eating, and it ate even more than the first day.</p>
<p>It should be full this time, right? Zhang Xiao already felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>However, Tyrant Behemoth continued eating on the third day. It was like a black hole that couldn’t be filled as it constantly devoured the Fiend Stones.</p>
<p>In just three days, Tyrant Behemoth resolved the problem of the Fiend Stone proliferation that had plagued the Zhang family.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Xiao couldn’t be happy. The problem with the Fiend Stones was temporarily resolved, but how was he to feed Tyrant Behemoth?</p>
<p>There was still nearly a month left until the auction. Just the thought of Tyrant Behemoth eating like this every day made his knees go weak. How many Essence Energy Crystals did he have to get to feed Tyrant Behemoth like this?</p>
<p>I don’t believe that Tyrant Behemoth doesn’t need digesting. It definitely needs time to digest after eating so many Fiend Stones. Even if it isn’t fed for half a month, it shouldn’t be hungry. Zhang Xiao still had some hope.</p>
<p>But soon, Zhang Xiao realized that he was too naive.</p>
<p>After not feeding it for half a day, Zhang Xiao realized that Tyrant Behemoth was showing the symptoms of hunger that Zhou Wen had mentioned.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiao gritted his teeth and took out the dimensional crystals in his small vault to feed Tyrant Behemoth. However, only after half of the small vault was finished the hungry did Tyrant Behemoth’s hunger symptoms vanish.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiao’s expression was extremely ugly. If Tyrant Behemoth ate like this, his little vault could only feed it for four or five days at most, but what would happen after that?</p>
<p>Zhang Xiao suddenly realized that he had probably been tricked by Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen had said that he had to feed him until he left Mount Dragon Tiger. How could Zhang Xiao have so many Essence Crystals to feed Tyrant Behemoth?</p>
<p>That’s not right. If Tyrant Behemoth can eat so much, how can Zhou Wen afford to rear it? If I can’t afford it, it’s even more impossible for Zhou Wen. Zhang Xiao felt that Zhou Wen definitely had a way to prevent Tyrant Behemoth from eating, such as letting Tyrant Behemoth sleep to reduce its expenditure.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Xiao didn’t know what to do. All he could do was discuss it with Zhang Chunqiu.</p>
<p>When Zhang Chunqiu heard Zhang Xiao, he shook his head and said, “What else can we do? Apologize and get him to take back Tyrant Behemoth. Otherwise, what else can we do? Don’t tell me you really want to rear it for a month? Anyway, I won’t lend you any dimensional crystals.”</p>
<p>“What I mean is that there must be a way to make Tyrant Behemoth not need to eat. Otherwise, no one could afford to feed it. It’s impossible for Zhou Wen to feed it like this every day. Do you think there’s a way?” Zhang Xiao had his pride, so he naturally wasn’t willing to return Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>“I have no solution. You can ask Zhou Wen,” Zhang Chunqiu said as he spread out his hands.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiao couldn’t help but be dumbfounded that even someone as resourceful as Zhang Chunqiu was helpless. However, he couldn’t bring himself to apologize to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>I don’t believe that Zhou Wen can raise it, but I can’t. There must be a way. Zhang Xiao brought Tyrant Behemoth back to think of a solution.</p>
<p>However, if it wasn’t full, it wasn’t full. Tyrant Behemoth’s appetite was real. There was no way to fool it into not being hungry.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiao thought of many solutions. He even wanted to hypnotize Tyrant Behemoth to temporarily enter hibernation.</p>
<p>It was useless. Even if it fell asleep, Tyrant Behemoth’s hunger symptoms remained. As long as the symptoms appeared, Zhou Wen would definitely sense them.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiao really couldn’t afford to embarrass himself. Once Tyrant Behemoth was hungry, he had to feed it. After a few days, his little vault had been emptied, so he had to borrow from others.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiao was a person who cared about his reputation. He would rather sell everything to raise Tyrant Behemoth until Zhou Wen left. He definitely couldn’t send him back now.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Xiao was filled with regret. If he had known that Tyrant Behemoth could eat that much, he wouldn’t have agreed to help Zhou Wen raise it.</p>
<p>Now, as long as he saw Tyrant Behemoth, he felt his heart turn cold. Just a slight movement from Tyrant Behemoth made his legs go limp.</p>
<p>How the hell is this a Companion Beast? It’s a bottomless pit. How did that bastard Zhou Wen raise it to the Mythical stage? Zhang Xiao felt extremely depressed.</p>
<p>But he knew that Zhou Wen had definitely invested heavily. Even if there was a way to make Tyrant Behemoth not eat or drink after advancing to the Mythical stage, he definitely had to invest a large amount of resources to advance it.</p>
<p>The amount of resources was unimaginable.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had spent the past few nights in Celestial Master Manor and spent the days shopping nearby. He mainly wanted Liu Yun to find him, but unfortunately, he hadn’t seen Liu Yun. This made Zhou Wen worry if Liu Yun had really been killed by Ya’er.</p>
<p>When he returned to Celestial Master Manor at night, he realized that Zhang Chunqiu was sitting in the garden he had to pass through. He looked like he was waiting for him.</p>
<p>“Looking for me?” Zhou Wen asked when he saw Zhang Chunqiu stand up.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu handed a small paint box to Zhou Wen. “This is the Life Reversing Spirit Talisman we agreed on previously.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t I agree to lend Tyrant Behemoth to Zhang Xiao for free? There’s no need to give me this,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu said with a smile, “Zhang Xiao was wrong in this matter. I apologize on his behalf. Take the Life Reversing Spirit Talisman. There’s still a little something here. Consider it a token of my appreciation. On account of Yuzhi, how about we call it quits?”</p>
<p>“You are being too serious. It’s inevitable for young people to have disputes. I’ll accept the Life Reversing Spirit Talisman. There’s no need for anything else. I’ll take back Tyrant Behemoth and pretend nothing happened,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Don’t take it back yet. Let Zhang Xiao feed it for another two more days. It might not be a bad thing to let him suffer a little,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>“Alright, as you wish,” Zhou Wen said as he took the box containing the Life Reversing Spirit Talisman.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Chunqiu stuffed the other box into Zhou Wen’s hands. “Take this too. It has nothing to do with anything else. Just treat it as a token of my appreciation. You might need it during the auction.”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll accept it.” Zhou Wen didn’t decline.</p>
<p>After chatting for a while, Zhang Chunqiu left. Zhou Wen returned to his room and opened the two boxes. One of them contained the Life Reversing Spirit Talisman, and in the other box was a card. The card was carved from jade. It was the size of a name card without any patterns. Only the word “Celestial Master” was engraved on it.</p>
<p>What’s the use of this thing? Zhou Wen looked at it for a while and realized that it was an ordinary jade carving. It wasn’t a dimensional item.</p>
<p>In the courtyard of Dragon Tiger Town, Moses and the rest were discussing something.</p>
<p>“We have to obtain the Earth Elemental Beast. If we can’t obtain it, we can only use forceful means.” The elder looked at Moses and said, “You have to be mentally prepared. You might need to take action when the time comes.”</p>
<p>Moses smiled and said, “My Guardian and I are ready. We can take action at any time.”</p>
<p>“Let’s wait until the auction results are out. Mount Dragon Tiger belongs to the Zhang family after all,” the elder said. “Even if we want to make a move, we have to wait until the item leaves Mount Dragon Tiger.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter836'>Chapter 836: Fiend Stone Rebirth</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>After two days, Zhou Wen unsummoned Tyrant Behemoth. Zhang Xiao didn’t come looking for him; it was considered a tacit understanding.</p>
<p>When Tyrant Behemoth vanished, Zhang Xiao heaved a sigh of relief. If he reared it for a month, he would really go bankrupt.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been waiting for Liu Yun, but before he arrived, Zhang Chunqiu rushed over to find him.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, there’s a problem with the Fiend Tomb. Can you lend me your Tyrant Behemoth again?” Zhang Chunqiu’s expression was solemn. It looked like things were really serious.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Zhou Wen needed to know more due to the severity of the matter. He couldn’t risk Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>“The Fiend Stones that grew out of Fiend Tomb had already been eaten by Tyrant Behemoth. Nothing happened in the past few days, but just now, the Fiend Stones have begun to grow again. Furthermore, their growth speed is even faster than before. I want to borrow your Tyrant Behemoth to try eating them up again,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“Is it convenient for me to go with you?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Of course. Follow me.” Zhang Chunqiu didn’t say anything else as he turned around and led the way.</p>
<p>After leaving the town, Zhang Chunqiu summoned an immortal crane and set off with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that the vicinity of Mount Dragon Tiger was like a fairyland, but after arriving at the Fiend Tomb, he realized that it wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>There was a place in the mountain where all vegetation died. Nothing grew. In broad daylight, the sun could clearly release its rays down, but the area felt extremely dark and eerie.</p>
<p>In an inconspicuous spot, Zhou Wen saw a tiny grave without a tombstone. If Zhang Chunqiu hadn’t said that it was a Fiend Tomb, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have imagined that this tiny grave would have such a huge back story behind it.</p>
<p>The only strange thing about this grave was its material. The graves of ordinary people were made of mud. Higher-level ones were made of rocks or bricks. Even higher-level ones were made of jade or even metal.</p>
<p>Although the grave was made of stone, the stone wasn’t man-made. It was as though the grave had grown out of stone.</p>
<p>The grayish-white stone seemed to emit a sinister aura. And near the grave, a large number of rocks appeared to have the same texture. They looked out of place with the mountain wall beside them, as though a layer of frost had covered the valley.</p>
<p>In every direction of the grave, there was a man-made stone platform. On each stone platform were members of the Zhang family. They monitored the Fiend Tomb from different angles.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu landed on one of the stone platforms with Zhou Wen and pointed at the grayish-white Fiend Stones beside him. “Please get Tyrant Behemoth to eat the grayish-white Fiend Stones over there.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth and got it to eat the grayish-white Fiend Stones.</p>
<p>According to Zhang Chunqiu’s instructions, Tyrant Behemoth stopped after eating a portion of the Fiend Stones.</p>
<p>“Alright, we are now waiting for the outcome. If you have the time, you can stay and take a look. If you don’t have time, I can get someone to take you back now,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“If it’s convenient, I want to stay and take a look.” Zhou Wen also wanted to see what was so special about the Fiend Tomb that the Zhang family had protected for so many years.</p>
<p>“You can stay, but remember not to leave this platform, especially at night,” Zhang Chunqiu exhorted Zhou Wen repeatedly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t joke around with his life and agreed readily.</p>
<p>The Fiend Stones didn’t seem to grow in that short period of time. It had been a few days since Tyrant Behemoth ate the Fiend Stones last time before they grew again; therefore, they wouldn’t grow back so quickly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t stare at that spot. Instead, he looked around the Fiend Tomb to see if he could find the tiny palm symbol. After carefully searching the vicinity, Zhou Wen’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p>
<p>Behind the tiny grave, Zhou Wen saw a tiny palm symbol with Truth Listener. It was engraved on the grave’s stone. As the stone wasn’t very flat, it looked like a natural pattern. However, Zhou Wen had seen many tiny palm symbols, so he definitely wouldn’t mistake them.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was in trouble again. Although he had found the tiny palm symbol, Zhang Chunqiu had repeatedly exhorted him not to leave the platform. How could he walk to the Fiend Tomb to take a picture?</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was already an exception for the Zhang family to let him come here. It was impossible for him to take pictures with his phone.</p>
<p>How can I take a picture? Zhou Wen thought for a while but failed to come up with a good solution.</p>
<p>Just as he was fretting, he suddenly heard someone shout, “It’s growing… It’s growing again…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly looked at the Fiend Stone hole that Tyrant Behemoth had produced from taking a big mouthful. He saw Fiend Stones appear on the ground that had been completely cleared.</p>
<p>The Fiend Stones were like bamboo shoots after the rain, rapidly growing.</p>
<p>This was the first time Zhou Wen had seen a stone grow.</p>
<p>“This time, the regrowth time is even shorter. It regrew in less than half an hour,” a member of the Zhang family said worriedly.</p>
<p>“Has this happened before?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>The Zhang family had been guarding the Fiend Tomb for so many years. They should have come up with means to deal with the Fiend Stones in the past.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Zhang Chunqiu shook his head and said, “In the past, the growth speed of the Fiend Stones was very slow. After the dimensional storms, the speed of growth gradually increased. In recent months, the speed of growth was much faster than before. In the past, the Fiend Stones only extended less than ten meters around the Fiend Tomb. Look at it now. In just a few months, it will probably reach almost a hundred meters.”</p>
<p>“In other words, you haven’t dealt with the Fiend Stones before?” Zhou Wen found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>“Of course. However, we only took a small portion of the Fiend Stones and took them back for research. We didn’t dig up the Fiend Stones on such a large scale. There has never been such a situation in the past. Although the place where the Fiend Stones were dug out still grew new Fiend Stones, it happened very slowly. It has never been this fast,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Suddenly, someone pointed at the spot where the Fiend Stones grew and exclaimed in surprise.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Zhang Chunqiu looked over and saw a human face symbol appear at the spot where the Fiend Stones grew. The symbol grew on the Fiend Stone as though a person was embedded in it. It looked extremely strange.</p>
<p>“Has this happened before?” Zhou Wen asked Zhang Chunqiu.</p>
<p>This time, Zhang Chunqiu only shook his head as he stared at the face on the Fiend Stone. At the same time, he ordered, “Everyone, enter an emergency state.”</p>
<p>Everyone tensed up. Everyone in the Zhang family knew how terrifying the Fiend Tomb was. Zhou Wen, who had no concept of the Fiend Tomb, had an ominous feeling.</p>
<h3 id='chapter837'>Chapter 837: Ba</h3>
<p>1</p>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The human face had all five facial features and its eyes were closed. Unlike ordinary stone masks, the face on the stone didn’t have any vibes. It was as though it could open its eyes and come alive at any moment.</p>
<p>Everyone looked warily at the face on the stone. On the stone platform beside them, someone from the Zhang family suddenly leaped down.</p>
<p>It was unexpected, no one had the time to react. By the time they realized what had happened, the person had already jumped from the platform to the ground.</p>
<p>The ground was filled with Fiend Stones. The moment the person landed on the ground, the shoes on his feet strangely turned into Fiend Stone. Even his calves rapidly turned into Fiend Stone. It just took all of two seconds before both calves turned into Fiend Stone.</p>
<p>Everything happened too quickly. Only Zhang Chunqiu reacted. Using his hand as a saber, he slashed out a saber beam in midair, severing the petrified legs. He extended his hand and pulled him back to the stone platform.</p>
<p>At that moment, the person seemed to regain consciousness. He screamed as his legs kept bleeding.</p>
<p>“Stop the bleeding and treat his injuries,” Zhang Chunqiu instructed as he stared at the leg that had been completely petrified.</p>
<p>The legs remained standing on the ground and became one with the Fiend Stones as though they were part of them. It was so strange that it made one’s scalp tingle.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen really wanted to ask what was going on, it was clearly not the time to ask such questions. He had been using Truth Listener to scan the Fiend Tomb and the Fiend Stones, but he didn’t discover anything abnormal. All he could sense was that there was Essence Energy flowing within the Fiend Stone; nothing else was special.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, go back now. The situation at the Fiend Tomb has changed. It’s too dangerous. We need to prevent any accidents,” Zhang Chunqiu said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen really wanted to take a picture of the tiny palm symbol of the Fiend Tomb, it was impossible for him to request to take a picture in such a situation. He had to listen to Zhang Chunqiu and leave.</p>
<p>The Fiend Tomb looked a little troublesome. When the Zhang family evacuated Zhou Wen, he could see members of the Zhang family constantly rushing towards the Fiend Tomb as reinforcements.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what the Fiend Tomb was like. He couldn’t help even if he wanted to.</p>
<p>When he returned to Celestial Master Manor, Zhou Wen kept thinking about the Fiend Tomb. He didn’t know what that strange face was.</p>
<p>It looked like a part of the Fiend Stone or some dimensional creature. Zhou Wen couldn’t be sure.</p>
<p>And this seemed to be the beginning of a nightmare. In the next few days, it was obvious that the entire Zhang family was in a tense state. There were constantly people leaving the Celestial Master Manor, and there was a high chance that they were heading for the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>“Yuzhi, how’s the situation at the Fiend Tomb?” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but ask when he saw Zhang Yuzhi again.</p>
<p>“The situation isn’t good. Over the last few days, there have been people who attempted to jump into the Fiend Tomb every day. Although they were saved in the end, it’s becoming more and more frequent. No reason has been found, and questioning them comes up empty. If they still can’t find the reason, they will probably be in big trouble.</p>
<p>“Have you tried shattering the face on the Fiend Stone?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“It’s useless. It will regrow if it’s shattered. After the face on the Fiend Stone was shattered, stone faces grew in other places. Now, there are seven stone faces around the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that the Zhang family had really encountered trouble this time. If they couldn’t resolve it, people would keep jumping in. In the end, the entire Zhang family might be wiped out.</p>
<p>“Can you tell me what’s going on with the Fiend Tomb? If it’s inconvenient, forget it,” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi hesitated for a moment before whispering to Zhou Wen, “I’ll tell you about this, but don’t tell anyone. Legend has it that our Zhang family’s ancestor was buried in a special cave. With the help of the cave, a Celestial Master was born. Actually, that’s not the case. Our Zhang family found the special cave, but we didn’t find it to bury ourselves inside, but to prevent the things inside from coming out.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? Do you mean that someone was already buried inside?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“To be precise, it’s not a person, but a Ba,” Zhang Yuzhi said.</p>
<p>“Ba? Is it a type of zombie?” Zhou Wen seemed to have heard of such monsters, but he wasn’t too sure. He felt that it had something to do with zombies.</p>
<p>“Ordinary people often mix Ba and zombies together. In fact, the two are not the same thing. In myths, a Ba is the goddess of the heavens. She descended to the human world to help Yellow Emperor defeat Chiyou. However, because she exhausted her divine power, she couldn’t return to the heavens. Therefore, she can only sleep beneath the ground and wait for the day she recovers her divine power to return to the heavens.”</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi paused for a moment before continuing, “Ba descended to the mortal world to deal with Count of the Wind and Lord of the Rain. Even the storm they produced was incinerated in front of Ba. Even when Count of the Wind and Lord of the Rain joined forces, they weren’t a match for Ba. It’s obvious how powerful her divine power was. Ba slept underground, but once her divine power recovered, she woke up from her long slumber. Or perhaps someone disturbed her and woke her up. Her divine power spread out, causing the land to be dry and barren. That’s why she’s known as God of Drought, or Hiderigami in other places. It’s an extremely terrifying existence.</p>
<p>“Back then, my family’s ancestor discovered that the Ba that was sleeping underground was about to revive. That’s why he guarded the area to prevent the Ba from appearing. He was mistaken as having found a treasure cave. Over the years, our Zhang family has been guarding the Fiend Tomb to prevent the Ba from coming out. However, with the arrival of the dimensional storms, the power in the Fiend Tomb has become stronger. How long can our Zhang family guard it? Even we don’t know. The break out is only a matter of time.”</p>
<p>“It existed in the world before the dimensional storms. Is there really such a creature as a Ba?” Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed.</p>
<p>After the dimensional storms, it wasn’t surprising for any creature to appear. However, the Zhang family had already begun guarding against Ba since ancient times. This was truly surprising.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if there’s really a Ba, but there’s definitely something unbelievable in the Fiend Tomb. Over the years, strange things have frequently appeared in the Fiend Tomb. If it wasn’t for my Zhang family risking our lives to guard the area, I’m afraid the area around Mount Dragon Tiger would have long been plunged into misery and suffering,” Zhang Yuzhi said.</p>
<p>After saying that, Zhang Yuzhi got up and prepared to leave. “I have to go out for a few days. Don’t just wander around when I’m not in the Celestial Master Manor, lest others misunderstand.”</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” Zhou Wen was puzzled as to why Zhang Yuzhi was heading out.</p>
<p>The Fiend Tomb was already extremely dangerous. Logically speaking, Zhang Yuzhi should have stayed inside Celestial Master Manor to help.</p>
<p>“I’m going to kill dimensional creatures with my brothers,” Zhang Yuzhi said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen recalled the matter regarding Zhang Yuzhi’s Life Providence and said to her, “Actually, I have a golden apple that can change a person’s Life Providence without any side effects. Do you want to give it a try?”</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi was first delighted before shaking her head. “There’s no need. This is all the useless me can do to help everyone.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter838'>Chapter 838: Three Realms’ Best Wind</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen remained silent. Zhang Yuzhi was lucky, but at the same time, she was unlucky. She had to withstand the pros and cons of her ability and pain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could understand Zhang Yuzhi’s feelings. She wasn’t willing to become best friends with dimensional creatures before killing them.</p>
<p>However, the Zhang family was in such a difficult situation. It was even possible that they would be wiped out. What she did might be saving the lives of all her family members.</p>
<p>Every family has its hardships. It’s not easy for a large family like the Zhang family either. Zhou Wen sighed inwardly.</p>
<p>After Zhang Yuzhi left, Zhou Wen didn’t stay in Celestial Master Manor. He went to an inn in Dragon Tiger Town. On the one hand, he didn’t want to trouble the Zhang family, and on the other hand, it was also convenient for Liu Yun to contact him when he arrived.</p>
<p>That afternoon, Demonic Neonate completed her evolution and became an Epic. Her various skills didn’t change, and only her stats increased to 41. Zhou Wen could only continue to look forward to the pleasant surprise the Wheel of Destiny would bring when she evolved to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate’s return made Zhou Wen feel a lot more at ease. Although she was only at the Epic stage, her combat strength was greatly beneficial to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was feeling gratified that Demonic Neonate had completed her evolution, Banana Fairy, who hadn’t advanced to the Mythical stage, successfully advanced to the Mythical stage on the same day.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was overjoyed. He had been waiting for Banana Fairy for too long. Seeing Banana Fairy break out of her egg and transform into a young girl in a jade-silk dress, Zhou Wen couldn’t wait to see her stats.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy: Mythical (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life State: Supreme Yin Spirit Root.</p>
<p>Life Soul: Divine Wind Immortal</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Three Realms’ Best Wind (Yin)</p>
<p>Strength: 81</p>
<p>Speed: 81</p>
<p>Constitution: 81</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 81</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Supreme Yin Wind</p>
<p>Companion Form: Fan</p>
<p>There weren’t many changes to the other skills, but her basic stats had increased to 81 points of a top Mythical. The additional Wheel of Destiny was actually called the Three Realms’ Best Wind. This name was very domineering, but he didn’t know how effective it was.</p>
<p>Why is there the word Yin behind the Wheel of Destiny? Could it be that there’s the Three Realms’ Best Wind with the word Yang? Zhou Wen found it odd.</p>
<p>Summoning Banana Fairy in reality, he saw a girl in green clothes with a light veil. She looked to be about fourteen or fifteen years old. Her snow-white legs were bare as she sat on a banana leaf.</p>
<p>At that moment, the banana leaf was much bigger than before. The girl sat there, floating. Her veil was lithe and she looked uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen didn’t mind the appearance of a Companion Beast, he was naturally in a good mood with such a beautiful and adorable Companion Beast by his side.</p>
<p>He launched a game dungeon and entered the Metalwork Temple dungeon. Zhou Wen wanted to see how powerful Banana Fairy’s Wheel of Destiny was.</p>
<p>There were furnaces everywhere in the Metalwork Temple and the temperature was rather high.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy sat on the banana leaf and floated beside the blood-colored avatar. Under Zhou Wen’s orders, she puffed up her cheeks and blew at the Metalwork Temple.</p>
<p>Whoosh!</p>
<p>Large swaths of Fire Elemental Sprites and various dimensional creatures were blown away. Anything that could move was blown away. As for the huge furnaces, they were all extinguished.</p>
<p>As though a hurricane had passed, Zhou Wen saw the game’s notification column being flooded. Notices of various dimensional creatures dying kept popping up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen quickly walked into the Metalwork Temple and realized that the flames at the back of the temple had also been extinguished. It was a mess.</p>
<p>The Metalwork Temple that was originally filled with furnaces no longer had any flames. The temperature had returned to normal and he no longer felt hot.</p>
<p>What left Zhou Wen somewhat depressed was that the dimensional creatures that had been blown to death by the Three Realms’ Best Wind had been sent flying. The dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs that dropped couldn’t be found.</p>
<p>That’s way too strong. As expected of the Three Realms’ Best Wind! Just as Zhou Wen was feeling excited, he saw Banana Fairy looking somewhat exhausted. Her Essence Energy had been drained, and even the Three Realms’ Best Wind had entered a cooldown state.</p>
<p>What a pity. If I could get her to do it a few times in a row, this thing would be better than nuclear bombs, Zhou Wen thought greedily.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Even without the Wheel of Destiny’s augmentation, Banana Fairy’s Supreme Yin Wind was considered a powerful divine technique. Ordinary Mythical creatures couldn’t withstand a single strike from her. Even if they weren’t blown away, they would be frozen.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate and Banana Fairy’s complete evolution delighted Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>After grinding Pill Furnace Mountain again, no Mythical Companion Egg dropped.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen went out for a stroll that day. When he returned, he realized that Liu Yun was sitting in his room. Zhou Wen had no idea when he had arrived.</p>
<p>Liu Yun didn’t look well. He had dark circles under his eyes and he looked cranky. His hair was greasy and messy. He looked like he hadn’t washed his hair for weeks.</p>
<p>The stubble on his face had grown out and his clothes weren’t clean. If not for his good looks and branded clothes, he would have been mistaken as a beggar.</p>
<p>“Where’s Ya’er?” Zhou Wen asked Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“Ya’er is fine. Don’t worry. It’s very easy to see her. Help me do something,” Liu Yun said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>It hadn’t been easy for him all this while. Now, he could finally extort Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to help you steal the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“That’s right.” Liu Yun nodded smugly. “As long as you do as I say, I’ll naturally return Ya’er to you after everything is done. Otherwise…”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to say otherwise. If you like it, continue having her,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“What? Aren’t you afraid that I’ll kill…” Liu Yun was furious. He had suffered so much just for this moment. To his surprise, Zhou Wen actually said such a thing? It infuriated him.</p>
<p>“If you dare kill her, do it,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? Do you think I don’t dare?” Liu Yun said angrily.</p>
<p>“Did you find your journey extremely problematic?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“What has that got to do with you?” Liu Yun’s heart skipped a beat as he asked Zhou Wen suspiciously.</p>
<p>“It has nothing to do with me, but you can think about when your bad luck started,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Are you saying that all of this was caused by Ya’er?” Liu Yun was immediately enraged. He had always thought that it was his fault, but he never expected the problem to be with that little girl.</p>
<p>“Do you know Wang Lu from the Wang family? Some people are born different. Ya’er is such a person, but she’s different from Wang Lu. She won’t bring you luck… Do you understand what I mean? Anyway, if you like her, continue taking her around. It saves me trouble,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was dumbfounded. He never expected such a thing to happen. Of course he knew Wang Lu from the Wang family. He even knew Wang Chan, but he never expected Ya’er to be such a person as well.</p>
<h3 id='chapter839'>Chapter 839: Nutrition Fee</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“This… Why don’t I return her to you?” Liu Yun felt a little guilty.</p>
<p>He originally didn’t believe it, but when he thought of what he had encountered along the way, Liu Yun felt that he had to believe it.</p>
<p>“I’ve been very busy recently. I don’t have time to take care of a child. Why don’t you help me take care of her for a few more days? Let’s talk when I return to Luoyang,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Take care my ass,” Liu Yun said gloomily.</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother, don’t be anxious. At most, I’ll pay you for your labor. How about one Epic Companion Egg a day? It won’t be a problem to hire a female celebrity as a nanny for this price. It’s a bargain. What do you think?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Liu Yun slammed his palm on the table and said righteously, “Who do you think I, Liu Yun, am? I’m the great God of Theft, Liu Yun. Am I someone who takes care of children? Ignoring the fact that you give me an Epic Companion Egg every day, even if you give me a Mythical Companion Egg every day, I won’t do it. Just you wait. I’ll send Ya’er back to you now. Take care of her yourself.”</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother, this isn’t appropriate. Look at how you brought her all the way here only to return her to me. Aren’t you losing out? I suggest that you continue taking care of her for a few more days,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Why would I believe you? You are terrible. Wouldn’t it be worse if I took care of her?” Liu Yun said.</p>
<p>“Are you really returning her to me?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Of course. I, Liu Yun, never go back on my word,” Liu Yun said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“Alright, but you’ve been taking care of Ya’er for so many days. She must have lost weight from your hunger. You have to give her some nutrition money so that I can buy her some delicious supplements, right?” Zhou Wen extended his hand in front of Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was dumbfounded. He had seen shameless people, but he had never seen someone so shameless.</p>
<p>“You’re still demanding nutrition fees from me?” Liu Yun was extremely angry and aggrieved. His hands were trembling. “I’m the one who’s skinny because of hunger, alright? Damn it, I shat out everything I ate and vomited everything I drank along the way. I didn’t eat or say anything. I cried and laughed all day. In the middle of the night, I laughed until the entire hotel thought that it was haunted. Do you think it was easy for me? Let me tell you, that brat had a great time eating and drinking. I’m about to die, do you know that? Why are you asking me for nutrition fees?”</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother, you shouldn’t be shirking your responsibility in this matter. You were the one who abducted her. You make it sound as though Ya’er abducted you. Don’t you feel ashamed?” Zhou Wen was finally completely at ease. He held back his laughter and said, “It’s fine if you don’t want to give it to me. Anyway, I plan on staying at Celestial Master Manor for a few days. If you have the ability, send Ya’er there.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“If you don’t want her, I’ll kill her,” Liu Yun said ruthlessly.</p>
<p>“You dare to kill such a person? As long as you aren’t afraid of being unlucky your entire life, go ahead,” Zhou Wen said as he spread out his hands.</p>
<p>When Liu Yun thought of the days he had spent and how he would be spending the rest of his days in that manner, he immediately shivered.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Liu Yun’s angry face lit up with a smile. “Junior Brother, we’re all brothers. Why are you treating me like an outsider? Just tell me what my disciple-niece likes to eat. I’ll buy it for her. She can eat whatever she wants.”</p>
<p>“That’s more what an Eldest Senior Brother should be like.” Zhou Wen gave him a thumbs up. “By the way, Eldest Senior Brother, how do you transfer a Companion Beast to someone else with the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art? I’ve studied it for a long time, but I don’t understand how it works.”</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, if you want to learn, I’ll definitely teach you. However, you have to condense a Life Soul with the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art first.” Liu Yun thought to himself, You don’t mainly cultivate the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art. It would be strange if you could condense a Life Soul.</p>
<p>“The Life Soul of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art has already been condensed. Tell me, how should I use it?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s eyes widened as he asked in disbelief, “What? Your Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art has condensed a Life Soul?”</p>
<p>“I just condensed it not long ago. It’s too difficult to cultivate. It’s still a Primordial Body,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Liu Yun wanted to slap Zhou Wen in the face and smash his irritating face, but after some thought, he didn’t dare do it.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, you must not joke. If you haven’t condensed a Life Soul of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art and try using my method, you will die.” Liu Yun still found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>“What’s your Life Soul’s name?” Zhou Wen asked Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“There’s no harm in telling you. My Life Soul is called Astral Soul. It means the soul of the stars in the heavens.” As Liu Yun spoke, he summoned a bit of starlight. The starlight flowed as though it was condensing thousands of stars.</p>
<p>“My Life Soul isn’t as resounding as your name. It’s called Fine Dust, but it should be similar.” Zhou Wen summoned his Fine Dust Life Soul.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was immediately stunned when he saw Zhou Wen’s Fine Dust. Although Life Souls were different and their abilities might be different, he could sense that it was undoubtedly a Life Soul condensed from the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art. There was no mistake.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, won’t there be a problem with dual cultivating Essence Energy Arts?” Liu Yun swallowed his saliva and asked.</p>
<p>“Of course not. Are you going to tell me your method or not? If not, I’m going to Celestial Master Manor,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Don’t be anxious. This method is a little complicated, but since you already have the Life Soul of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art, it shouldn’t be difficult for you to learn it.” Liu Yun explained his method to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was originally worried that his Life Soul was different from Liu Yun’s. He thought the abilities wouldn’t be completely the same, so he might not be able to learn Liu Yun’s method.</p>
<p>However, after hearing Liu Yun’s explanation, he realized that his worries were unnecessary. He could also use Liu Yun’s method. In fact, he didn’t rely on the Life Soul’s ability, but the ability of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art itself.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen grasped Liu Yun’s method. He was just short of executing it.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, continue practicing. I’ll fetch disciple-niece over.” With that said, Liu Yun ran off, afraid that Zhou Wen would ask him for something else.</p>
<p>He had always been a person who refused to suffer losses, but every time he encountered Zhou Wen, he would suffer losses. Now, he only wanted to distance himself from Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t really want anything from Liu Yun, so he didn’t stop him.</p>
<p>After a while, an employee knocked on Zhou Wen’s door and said that someone was looking for him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen went out to take a look and saw Ya’er standing outside, but he didn’t see Liu Yun. Liu Yun was definitely afraid that Zhou Wen would extort him again, so he didn’t even dare show his face.</p>
<p>“Ya’er, did you suffer any grievances along the way?” Zhou Wen asked as he stroked her head.</p>
<p>Ya’er shook her head and took off the necklace around her neck before handing it to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He knew that this was the necklace that Ya’er had obtained from Liu Yun, but he didn’t understand why it was handed to him.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to help you put it away?” Zhou Wen asked as he took the necklace.</p>
<p>Ya’er shook her head again and pointed at the gem on the necklace. It looked like there was something wrong with the gem on the necklace.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen checked the gem on the necklace in puzzlement. After taking a closer look, he really found a problem.</p>
<h3 id='chapter840'>Chapter 840: Red Heart Gu</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The naked eye couldn’t see anything wrong with the ruby necklace, but when Zhou Wen activated the Hell King Life Soul, he realized that there was a blood-colored shadow in the largest ruby in the middle of the pendant. It looked like a spider.</p>
<p>“What’s this? A Spirit Body?” Zhou Wen asked Ya’er.</p>
<p>“Gu,” Ya’er said.</p>
<p>This is also a Gu? Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. No matter how he looked at it, there was a Spirit Body inside the ruby.</p>
<p>However, on second thought, it made sense. No one stipulated that Gu with a spirit body could not exist. The spider in the ruby was likely a spirit-type Gu.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder Ya’er took this necklace. So there’s such a strange Gu inside. I wonder what stage it is. Zhou Wen took out his phone and snapped a picture of the ruby with the spider.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s surprise, the stats appeared. Furthermore, it wasn’t a dimensional creature, but a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Red Heart Gu: Mythical</p>
<p>Life Providence: Widow</p>
<p>Life Soul: Queen of Hearts</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Love Gu</p>
<p>Strength: 72</p>
<p>Speed: 80</p>
<p>Constitution: 71</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 80</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Neurotoxin</p>
<p>Companion Form: Pendant</p>
<p>This is a Companion Beast that has already hatched, but why is it here? Where did its owner go? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, once the owner of a Companion Beast died, the Companion Beast would vanish.</p>
<p>This Red Heart Gu had clearly hatched, but it was trapped in the necklace. Its owner had not unsummoned it, so this was somewhat strange.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to ask Liu Yun about the necklace’s origins, but he couldn’t find him. All he could do was search for pictures online to see if there were any clues.</p>
<p>It was very easy to find the origins of the necklace. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be surprised. This necklace has been circulating since ancient times before the dimensional storms. Furthermore, from the looks of it, the culprit behind the fates of those who possessed it was likely the Red Heart Gu. This makes things strange. Did they already have Companion Beasts in that era?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t figure it out. He asked Ya’er, but she couldn’t answer.</p>
<p>“You can control the Red Heart Gu inside, right?” Zhou Wen asked Ya’er.</p>
<p>Ya’er nodded. In fact, all the pain Liu Yun had suffered along the way was because of this Red Heart Gu.</p>
<p>“Then keep it. If you encounter danger in the future, you can protect yourself.” Zhou Wen returned the necklace to Ya’er.</p>
<p>Ya’er shook her head and said a few words. “For you… Raise me… Don’t… throw me away…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly realized that Ya’er was a human and not his Companion Beast when he heard that. His attitude towards her seemed to make her feel insecure.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen picked up the necklace and put it on Ya’er. He stroked her head and said, “I gave you your name. Do you know who’s qualified to give others a name?”</p>
<p>Ya’er shook her head. Clearly, she didn’t understand because she didn’t have a name previously.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen said, “Only family members can give their children names. I gave you your name. You are my family and my sister, so you don’t have to worry about me abandoning you. That kind of thing will never happen. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>Ya’er looked at Zhou Wen and shook her head. She didn’t seem to understand the concept of family.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. You will slowly understand in the future. A family member doesn’t need you to give them anything. I will treat you well. I will accompany you, sharing sadness and joy with you…” Zhou Wen tried his best to make Ya’er understand. Unfortunately, he was a person with a low EQ, so he just couldn’t express it well.</p>
<p>As the necklace was too eye-catching, and Zhou Wen wasn’t someone who loved antiques, he ended up dismantling the necklace and separated the pendant embedded inside.</p>
<p>The gems outside were just decorations. The ruby in the middle and a thin thread were the main body of the Red Heart Gu. Zhou Wen only needed the main body of the Red Heart Gu to be worn around Ya’er’s neck. He kept the gem necklace to prevent any unnecessary trouble.</p>
<p>As he had noticed Ya’er’s psychological problems, Zhou Wen clumsily wanted to treat her better, but he didn’t know what to do.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen had been very independent since he was young, he had never experienced how his elders protected and loved him. Therefore, he didn’t know how to treat others well.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only do his best. He took the time to take Ya’er out for a walk and buy her some food or toys. However, Zhou Wen didn’t know what girls played. In fact, he didn’t know what boys played either because he had never played with any toys when he was young.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen bought a phone for Ya’er and taught her how to use it. He also added his account to her friend’s list. This way, Ya’er could send him a message or call him when he wasn’t around.</p>
<p>Ya’er seemed very happy and fiddled with her phone for a long time.</p>
<p>However, she wasn’t interested in games or movies. She only learned how to use her phone to send messages to Zhou Wen, but she didn’t know how to type or write. Even when she sent voice messages, she didn’t say much. It was very troublesome.</p>
<p>However, Ya’er worked hard to learn language and how to type.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took out his phone and continued grinding. His luck today was pretty good. Just as the nine dragons respawned, another Companion Egg dropped after killing them.</p>
<p>Demon Blood True Dragon (Zhen): Mythical</p>
<p>Life Providence: Demon Dragon Bloodline (Incomplete)</p>
<p>Life Soul: Zhen Dragon (Incomplete)</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Dragon Domain (Incomplete)</p>
<p>Strength: 80</p>
<p>Speed: 80</p>
<p>Constitution: 80</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 80</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Dragon Breath, Demon Dragon Transformation, Demon Dragon True Body, Dragon Wrath</p>
<p>Companion Form: Dragon Scale Armor (Incomplete)</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for the fact that the word “Zhen” behind the Demon Dragon True Dragon was different, Zhou Wen would have imagined that it was the same Companion Egg that had dropped. Its stats and skills were identical.</p>
<p>I wonder if this thing can be fused? Zhou Wen tried matching it and realized that the compatibility between the two was 99%. It was almost impossible to fail.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen directly clicked on the fusion. After all, he couldn’t wear two sets of Dragon Scale Armor alone. He could try fusing them. Perhaps there would be a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>However, a notification suddenly popped up in the game: ‘Incomplete. Lacking main body, unable to fuse.’</p>
<p>What’s the meaning of this? Zhou Wen didn’t know what the so-called main body was. He could only guess that he needed to obtain all nine different Demon Blood True Dragons before fusing them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been grinding on Pill Furnace Mountain, but he didn’t obtain any Mythical Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>The dragon-patterned Rejuvenation Pill and the Tiger-Patterned Resurrection Pill would randomly spawn one every time. However, Zhou Wen hadn’t had a Companion Egg drop in the past few days.</p>
<h3 id='chapter841'>Chapter 841: Entering the Fiend Tomb Again</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>When it was time for Pill Furnace Mountain to respawn pill essence, Zhou Wen went to farm them again. The Golden Overlord Sword killed the pill essence that spewed out one by one. As he killed them, he suddenly saw a strange pill essence spew out from Pill Furnace Mountain.</p>
<p>The pill essence wasn’t the common red and golden color. Although it was white, it wasn’t a dragon-patterned Rejuvenation Pill. It had black colors, but it wasn’t a tiger-patterned Resurrection Pill either.</p>
<p>It was a pill that was half white, half black, half dragon-patterned, and half tiger-patterned. It looked strange and strangely harmonious. From the pill essence, one could faintly hear dragon and tiger roars.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The Golden Overlord Sword slashed at the pill essence, but a white dragon-shaped Essence Energy rushed out of the pill, blocking the Golden Overlord Sword’s sword beam.</p>
<p>Although the dragon-shaped Essence Energy was ultimately shattered by the Golden Overlord Sword, the latter did not then have the strength to injure the pill essence.</p>
<p>Before the Golden Overlord Sword could deliver a second attack, a tiger’s roar sounded from the pill essence’s body. A black-colored Essence Energy condensed into a ferocious tiger and pounced at the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth and slammed down with his claw, shattering the Essence Energy tiger.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth took another step forward, wanting to shatter the pill essence as well. However, a dragon and tiger’s roar sounded from the pill essence’s body. The shadow of a dragon and tiger rose and actually blocked Tyrant Behemoth’s attack.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth struck out several times, but it failed to shatter the dragon-tiger shadows. All it could do was activate Absolute Strength and roar as it struck out again. After more than ten punches, it shattered the dragon-tiger shadows.</p>
<p>The pill essence was also repeatedly struck by Tyrant Behemoth’s punches. Finally, it shattered into pieces. Its healing speed couldn’t keep up with the shattering speed.</p>
<p>‘Killed Mythical creature, Dragon Tiger Pill Essence. Discovered Companion Egg.’</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw the game notification, he saw a Companion Egg drop. He couldn’t help but be delighted as he hurriedly picked it up and hatched it.</p>
<p>Dragon Tiger Pill Essence: Mythical</p>
<p>Life Providence: Dragon Spirit Tiger Feracity</p>
<p>Life Soul: Dragon Tiger Combat</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Resurrection</p>
<p>Strength: 80</p>
<p>Speed: 80</p>
<p>Constitution: 80</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 81</p>
<p>Talent Skill: None</p>
<p>Companion Form: Pill (One-time use)</p>
<p>What a powerful pill essence. Can this thing really resurrect the dead? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be overjoyed when he saw the information on the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence.</p>
<p>Ignoring the other attributes, its Wheel of Destiny was somewhat powerful. In the introduction, it said that it had the ability to revive the dead. He didn’t know if that was true.</p>
<p>However, without a doubt, this was a life-saving item. Even if it was difficult to resurrect the dead, it would definitely have miraculous effects when used on serious injuries.</p>
<p>With such a treasure, Zhou Wen was even more motivated. Unfortunately, he didn’t gain anything after grinding the 81 pill essences.</p>
<p>During this period of time, there was no news from the Zhang family. Zhang Yuzhi didn’t return. The date of the auction was approaching.</p>
<p>This morning, Zhou Wen took Ya’er out for a stroll as usual. When he walked to the nearby river, he saw Zhang Chunqiu sitting on a bench by the river.</p>
<p>“What a coincidence.” Zhou Wen walked over with Ya’er to greet him.</p>
<p>“It’s not a coincidence. I came here specially to wait for you,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. “Why didn’t you go to the hotel to look for me?”</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu’s face was filled with exhaustion, but he still said with a smile, “It’s been stifling these past few days. I wanted to come out to take a breather, so I decided to wait for you here.”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“The matter with the Fiend Tomb is very troublesome. More than ten people from the Zhang family have died. They have all jumped into the Fiend Tomb and become Fiend Stone statues,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“Hasn’t someone been watching?” Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>“It’s useless. No one knows who will be the next one to jump. Perhaps the next one to jump will be the person guarding it. We have already thought of many solutions and even evacuated everyone from the Fiend Tomb, but there are still people who have walked to the Fiend Tomb themselves and become Fiend Stone statues,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a sigh.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Is there anything I can help you with?” On account of Zhang Yuzhi, Zhou Wen didn’t mind helping if he could.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu shook his head and said, “Up to now, I haven’t figured out a solution. I’m not here because of Fiend Tomb.”</p>
<p>“Then why are you looking for me?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>The Zhang family had encountered such a huge problem, but Zhang Chunqiu still took the time to meet him. It was probably something important.</p>
<p>“I came here to ask you a favor. The Zhang family is in contact with Sunset College. If there aren’t any problems, Yuzhi should be able to be a tutor at Sunset College. When the time comes, I hope you can take care of her. She doesn’t have many friends, so I can’t beg others,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“Is the matter with the Fiend Tomb really that dangerous?” Zhou Wen knew that if they weren’t doing it out of desperation, how would the Zhang family let Zhang Yuzhi leave Mount Dragon Tiger to go to Sunset College?</p>
<p>The Zhang family must have reached a helpless state before making such a decision.</p>
<p>“It’s just a precaution. After the auction ends, I’ll get Yuzhi to accompany you to Luoyang. If the Zhang family can successfully pass this trial, I’ll bring her back,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that this was an opportunity. Therefore, he looked at Zhang Chunqiu and said, “Although I don’t know much about the Fiend Tomb, I have some special abilities. Perhaps they can be of some help to the Fiend Tomb. If your Zhang family doesn’t mind, can you let me do a comprehensive survey of the Fiend Tomb?”</p>
<p>“The Zhang family is extremely grateful that you are willing to help us, so why would we mind? However, the Fiend Tomb is too dangerous. Anyone who has come into contact with the Fiend Tomb might subconsciously walk into it. I’m afraid…” Zhang Chunqiu didn’t continue, but his meaning was very clear.</p>
<p>“I’ve already been to the Fiend Tomb. If there’s really a problem, I won’t be able to escape. I’m doing this for myself.” Zhou Wen’s last sentence was the truth.</p>
<p>Surveying was only an excuse. What he really wanted to do was take a picture of the tiny palm symbol and download the Fiend Tomb dungeon.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen downloaded the Fiend Tomb dungeon, he could enter the Fiend Tomb in-game. Perhaps he could resolve the Zhang family’s problems.</p>
<p>“When do you want to go?” Zhang Chunqiu asked after some thought.</p>
<p>“The sooner the better. This matter can’t be delayed,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“In that case, come with me now.” Zhang Chunqiu led Zhou Wen to the Fiend Tomb again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted. This time, he could finally approach the Fiend Tomb and take a picture of the tiny palm symbol on it.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the Fiend Tomb again, there were clearly more people from the Zhang family stationed here. On every stone platform, there were four people sitting facing each other. If anything happened, the other three would immediately know to prevent any accidents.</p>
<h3 id='chapter842'>Chapter 842: Digging the Fiend Tomb</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Chunqiu, why did you bring him here?” an elder said with a frown when he saw Zhang Chunqiu bring Zhou Wen over.</p>
<p>“Uncle, Zhou Wen is proficient in many special reconnaissance-type Essence Energy Skills. As he might be able to help us discover the problem with the Fiend Tomb, I invited him over to take a look.” Zhang Chunqiu didn’t say that Zhou Wen had requested to come.</p>
<p>“Hurry up. Don’t affect the others.” The elder frowned slightly but didn’t say anything else.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu led Zhou Wen into the region of the Fiend Tomb. Zhou Wen could clearly see that the situation with the Fiend Stone Petrification had worsened. A small portion of the nearby mountain walls had already been petrified. The last time he had come, the Fiend Stones hadn’t covered such a large area.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there were more than ten Fiend Stone stone statues on the ground. They had different expressions and appearances. They were likely the Zhang family members who had run into the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>“How do you plan on investigating? Do you have any special needs?” Zhang Chunqiu asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I need to observe the Fiend Tomb up close. If possible, I would like to take a few photos,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You can take pictures, but you have to be fast. Furthermore, when you approach the Fiend Tomb, you can’t exceed those lines or touch the Fiend Stones. Otherwise, you will end up like them.” Zhang Chunqiu pointed at the red lines in the sky. They were about ten meters away from the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>“Alright, can I go now?” Zhou Wen agreed immediately. At a distance of about ten meters, his phone could lock onto the tiny palm symbol and download the dungeon.</p>
<p>“Go. I hope you can discover something,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen leaped into the air and used the Godfiend Life Providence to fly towards the Fiend Tomb. At the same time, he got Doctor Darkness to attach himself to him in his soul form and used his Eyes of Penetration to look at the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>In fact, the Eyes of Penetration didn’t have a good effect on things like metal and stone. Zhou Wen was only putting on a show for the Zhang family to prove that he had such abilities and wasn’t here to mess around.</p>
<p>When the Zhang family saw Zhou Wen’s eyes shoot out two beams at the Fiend Tomb like two searchlights, they looked at him curiously.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pretended to take a look before taking out his phone to take a picture. In fact, the Eyes of Penetration couldn’t see the interior of the Fiend Tomb through the thick Fiend Stones. Zhou Wen circled the Fiend Tomb and took the opportunity to snap a picture of the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>The game immediately entered the download screen, allowing Zhou Wen to relax.</p>
<p>After pretending to look around the Fiend Tomb seriously for a while, Zhou Wen returned to the stone platform.</p>
<p>“How is it?” When Zhang Chunqiu asked Zhou Wen, the other Zhang family members looked at him.</p>
<p>“I can’t tell anything for the time being. I’ll go back and think about it. Perhaps I can figure out something,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhang Chunqiu took Zhou Wen back without another word.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen returned to his residence, he couldn’t wait to open the Fiend Tomb dungeon that he had just downloaded. Firstly, he was very curious about the Fiend Tomb dungeon, and secondly, he hoped to help the Zhang family. He didn’t wish to see Zhang Yuzhi’s family destroyed and for her to be sent to Sunset College.</p>
<p>The game had successfully downloaded. A picture of a white grave appeared on the phone’s screen. Under it were the words “Fiend Tomb.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen clicked on the program and entered the game. What appeared in front of him was the crater in the mountain where the Fiend Tomb was. The tiny Fiend Tomb stood there, and the grayish-white Fiend Stones looked like snow under the moonlight.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that there were many strange faces just like in real life on the Fiend Stone-filled ground. There were more than ten faces, but none of them belonged to the Zhang family who had transformed into Fiend Stones.</p>
<p>According to Zhang Chunqiu, humans would only be petrified when they touched the Fiend Stones after the fiend faces appeared. They hadn’t discovered any similar problems back when they touched the Fiend Stones.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen believed in this. Tyrant Behemoth had previously eaten a Fiend Stone, and it wasn’t a problem.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned a few different types of pets and made them land on the ground. As expected, they were all petrified.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth again to see if it would be petrified. After all, it had eaten Fiend Stones before.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth landed on the Fiend Stones, but its feet also showed signs of Fiend Stone Petrification. However, it was at a slower speed.</p>
<p>It’s actually suffering from Fiend Stone Petrification as well? After Zhou Wen ordered Tyrant Behemoth to use Absolute Strength, the Fiend Stone Petrification stopped.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief. Thankfully, Tyrant Behemoth was still strong enough. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be easy for him to enter the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>As there was no entrance to the Fiend Tomb, he could only dig it open with brute force. This heavy responsibility could only be placed on Behemoth.</p>
<p>The Zhang family had an ancestral rule that the Fiend Tomb couldn’t be dug open. Otherwise, the Goddess Ba would awaken. When that happened, everything would be incinerated. Humans would have no chance of survival.</p>
<p>In reality, Zhou Wen definitely didn’t dare dig either, but in-game, there were naturally no taboos.</p>
<p>Under Zhou Wen’s command, Behemoth, who had activated Absolute Strength, slammed into the Fiend Tomb. The two horns on its head spun like an electric drill, immediately causing sparks to splatter everywhere on the Fiend Tomb. Fiend Stone powder splattered everywhere.</p>
<p>Just as Behemoth began digging the grave, the fiend faces on the ground suddenly seemed to come to life. They burrowed out from the ground and transformed into Fiend Stone statues.</p>
<p>The Fiend Stone statues pounced at Tyrant Behemoth without a word. Zhou Wen hurriedly sent out a few Companion Beasts to fight, preventing them from disturbing Tyrant Behemoth’s grave digging.</p>
<p>As it was only a test, the Companion Beasts Zhou Wen sent out weren’t his main combat pets. They were all Epic Runic Heavy-Armored Warriors. The only Mythical Companion Beast was a Golden Battle God Halberd.</p>
<p>The speed and strength of the Fiend Stone statues looked like they were at the Epic stage. However, after their bodies were shattered, they quickly revived inside the Fiend Stones. They couldn’t be killed no matter how hard he tried.</p>
<p>Furthermore, anything touched by the Fiend Stone statues would be petrified. It was very difficult to deal with them.</p>
<p>As the Fiend Tomb was dug open, more and more fiend faces appeared around it. They transformed into Fiend Stone statues that rushed to Behemoth’s side.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Behemoth in Absolute Strength was indeed an invincible existence. The Fiend Stone statues grabbed at its body, but they were unable to petrify it. They wrapped around Behemoth like a nest of ants.</p>
<p>Is there no way to completely kill them? Zhou Wen frowned slightly. He had already tried many Strength attributes, but they were useless. He could shatter the Fiend Stone statues, but he couldn’t stop them from reviving inside the Fiend Stones.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the game didn’t have any indication of successfully killing them. Clearly, shattering them wasn’t enough to kill them.</p>
<h3 id='chapter843'>Chapter 843: Ghoul Mask</h3>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>While Tyrant Behemoth was digging the Fiend Tomb, its horn seemed to have touched something, emitting a metallic clang. As for Tyrant Behemoth, it automatically took two steps back and stared at the dug up Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>Inside the Fiend Tomb, there was a huge human face. It was identical to the fiend faces that had appeared on the Fiend Stones. However, this face was much bigger, and it emitted a grayish-white strange aura.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was staring at the face as he sized it up, but it floated up by itself. Only then did he realize that it wasn’t a face, but a stone mask.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the problem of the fiend face appearing lies with this mask. Zhou Wen ordered Tyrant Behemoth to deliver a punch. He wanted to see what abilities this mask had.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength strike shattered the mask. This left Zhou Wen slightly taken aback. Although he felt that there weren’t many Companion Beasts in this world that could fight Tyrant Behemoth head-on, it was blasted apart with a single punch. It was too weak—even inferior to the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was feeling puzzled, he saw the dust that filled the sky float towards Tyrant Behemoth. Before Zhou Wen could react, the dust from the shattered mask touched Tyrant Behemoth’s face, turning into a complete mask.</p>
<p>However, this time, the mask matched the size of Tyrant Behemoth’s face, enveloping it completely.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately felt that something was amiss. Indeed, Tyrant Behemoth roared and struggled, trying to tear off the mask on its face, but it failed. Furthermore, its struggling slowed down. Soon, Zhou Wen realized that Tyrant Behemoth was no longer under his control.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth threw a punch at the blood-colored avatar who dodged to the side. Its fist smashed a huge hole in the mountain wall.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth’s terrifying strength was unleashed as it attacked the blood-colored avatar repeatedly. Zhou Wen’s strength wasn’t enough to fight Tyrant Behemoth, so he could only dodge.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen dodged, he observed the mask and mentally contacted Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>The mental connection was no longer working. The mask completely controlled Tyrant Behemoth. The mask’s ability surprised Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I can only give it a try. After shattering the mask, can I liberate Tyrant Behemoth? Zhou Wen put on the Invisibility Cloak and instantly vanished.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth was a Companion Beast that employed brute force. It had never been afraid of anyone in a head-on battle.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had vanished. It could only stand there in a daze. Its masked face looked around, but there was no sign of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Suddenly, an invisible sword beam flashed. The mask on Tyrant Behemoth’s face was cleaved into two and fell from Tyrant Behemoth’s face.</p>
<p>However, Tyrant Behemoth didn’t regain its freedom. The mask automatically shattered and condensed on Tyrant Behemoth’s face, forming a new mask. Tyrant Behemoth was still under its control.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued forward invisibly as the Light Concealment Sword in his hand rapidly flashed. Countless strikes instantly shattered the mask, but the outcome was still useless.</p>
<p>The shattered mask returned to Tyrant Behemoth’s face and reformed. It still firmly controlled Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>It’s impossible for there to be no weakness. What’s the weakness of the mask? Still invisible, Zhou Wen used the Hell King Life Soul’s ability and Truth Listener’s hearing to constantly scan the mask.</p>
<p>Coupled with Doctor Darkness’s penetrative vision, the mask had almost no secrets in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The mask itself was flawless. It was made of gray rocks, so he didn’t discover anything special.</p>
<p>It was unlike the Water Elemental that Zhou Wen had seen before. The Water Elemental could be scattered and reformed. However, there was a water element core in the Water Elemental’s body. As long as the core was destroyed, the Water Elemental could be killed.</p>
<p>However, this mask was different. It didn’t have a core in its body. No matter how he sliced its body or even blasted the mask to dust like Tyrant Behemoth, he couldn’t kill it.</p>
<p>Could it be that it really doesn’t have a weakness? Zhou Wen observed for a long time but failed to discover the weakness of the mask.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate, who was hiding in the Invisibility Cloak, hadn’t taken action. Clearly, she hadn’t found the flaw in the mask, so she had no intention of taking action.</p>
<p>Even Demonic Neonate and I can’t discover the flaws in the mask. Then, is it possible that there aren’t any flaws? Or perhaps, its flaws aren’t on its body? Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he focused his attention on the Fiend Tomb where he had discovered the mask.</p>
<p>Inside the Fiend Tomb were grayish-white Fiend Stones. After the mask flew out, the Fiend Stones below formed the shape of human faces, perhaps because they were compressed by the Fiend Stones above. However, they only looked a little similar in shape. They didn’t have the vibrancy of the other Fiend Stones. They didn’t seem to be living creatures.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t care. He had to give everything a shot. He immediately went over in his invisible state and quickly slashed out with Light Concealment Sword, slashing at the human-faced Fiend Stones in the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>Pfft!</p>
<p>Wherever the sword mark appeared, black blood spewed out like a fountain. As for Tyrant Behemoth’s mask, it suddenly distorted as cracks similar to the sword marks appeared.</p>
<p>When the black blood spewed out, the mask shattered with a crack and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>‘Killed Mythical creature, Ghoul Mask.’ A notification appeared in-game.</p>
<p>Nothing dropped? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. The Dragon Tiger Pill Essence that had recently dropped seemed to have expended all his luck. It had been days since anything good had dropped.</p>
<p>After the Ghoul Mask was dispatched, Zhou Wen recovered his connection with Tyrant Behemoth. Furthermore, the ghost faces in the Fiend Stone shattered. When the Companion Beasts touched the Fiend Stones again, they didn’t get petrified again.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the problem with Fiend Stone Petrification was triggered by the Ghoul Mask. I wonder if the Zhang family’s people ran towards the Fiend Tomb because of the Ghoul Mask. If that’s the case, the Zhang family’s problem should be resolvable, Zhou Wen thought to himself as he got Tyrant Behemoth to continue digging the Fiend Tomb to see what else was down there.</p>
<p>Without the interference of the Fiend Stone statues, Tyrant Behemoth dug even faster. It directly swallowed the Fiend Stones it dug out to replenish its expended Essence Energy.</p>
<p>As it dug, Tyrant Behemoth stopped as though it had lost its soul. It stood in front of the Fiend Tomb, motionless no matter how Zhou Wen ordered it.</p>
<p>What’s wrong now? Zhou Wen frowned slightly as he focused his gaze at the Fiend Tomb that had been dug seven to eight meters deep. He saw that apart from the Fiend Stones, there was another living creature in the pit.</p>
<h3 id='chapter844'>Chapter 844: Ba</h3>
<p>The creature looked very strange. Its lower body was like a snake, but it was also like a fish. Its upper body had two dragon claws, and its head resembled a dragon, but it didn’t have horns. It was a very strange creature.</p>
<p>It lay silently in the grave. For some reason, Tyrant Behemoth stood outside the pit and stared at it as though it was possessed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he summoned the Golden Battle God Halberd to attack the monster in the grave.</p>
<p>However, when the Golden Battle God Halberd approached the grave, it lost control and landed beside the pit.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly sent a few Companion Beasts over, but the outcome was the same. As long as they approached the grave, they would stand there motionless as though they had been possessed.</p>
<p>Be it animals or weapons, all Companion Beasts shared the same fate.</p>
<p>The dimensional creatures in this Fiend Tomb are really strange. First, it’s the Ghoul Mask, and now, it’s such a monster. Their abilities are so strange. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and summoned Truth Listener to the graveside.</p>
<p>However, Truth Listener didn’t stand there in a daze. It broke two earrings and, after descending, grabbed the monster with its claws, tearing it into two.</p>
<p>By the time the monster wanted to resist, it was already too late. It died an unnatural death, and only then did Tyrant Behemoth and the other Companion Beasts regain their lucidity.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I have enough Companion Beasts that have well-rounded abilities. Otherwise, I really wouldn’t be able to do anything to this Fiend Tomb, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>‘Killed Mythical creature, Ghost Hornless.’ A game notification popped up.</p>
<p>It’s another Mythical creature. What’s hidden underneath? Could it really be Ba? Zhou Wen wondered how powerful Ba would be if it was really Ba.</p>
<p>After eliminating Ghost Hornless, Zhou Wen ordered Tyrant Behemoth to continue digging. He wanted to see if there was a Ba in the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth received the order and continued digging. Not long after, the Fiend Stones below emitted a scorching aura. The deeper it went, the hotter the Fiend Stones became. Towards the end, the Fiend Stones turned into magma.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth wasn’t afraid of the magma as it sucked the magma into its stomach. As the magma vanished, something gradually revealed itself.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen finally saw something that wasn’t a Fiend Stone. It was a type of black metal that had been forged into the shape of a bed. There was a canopy on the bed with a transparent curtain hanging down.</p>
<p>The magma formed by the Fiend Stones was blocked by the veil, preventing it from entering the bed.</p>
<p>And on the bed, there was a stunning woman sleeping. Just sleeping there with her eyes closed she was beautiful beyond description. It was difficult to imagine how beautiful she would be if she opened her eyes.</p>
<p>The woman was dressed in red, making her figure look enchanting and charming. Even though the game’s style was cartoonish, it was already very provocative.</p>
<p>If it was in reality, he wondered how sexy and alluring she would be.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to admire her beauty. His expression was still solemn because he felt a familiar aura from this woman.</p>
<p>That aura wasn’t from a dimensional creature, but the aura of a Guardian.</p>
<p>However, typical Guardians were in cocoons, but this woman was sleeping on the bed. This only meant one thing; she had long broken out of the cocoon.</p>
<p>According to what Zhou Wen knew, it wasn’t possible for a Guardian to break out of the cocoon just because they were strong enough. Unless someone forcefully broke the cocoon of the Guardian, or someone contracted them, the Guardian couldn’t break out no matter how strong they were.</p>
<p>Now that this woman wasn’t in the cocoon, it could only mean that she had already contracted a human, or that someone had forcefully torn open the cocoon.</p>
<p>The Zhang family has protected the Fiend Tomb for so long it’s unlikely that someone else dug up the Fiend Tomb and contracted the Guardian. Then, there are only two possibilities. One is that the Zhang family has someone who contracted the Guardian. Another possibility is that this woman is the same as the fellow in the log. She’s one of the surviving Guardians from a previous era, Zhou Wen thought as the woman on the bed suddenly opened her eyes.</p>
<p>It wasn’t as beautiful as Zhou Wen imagined. It was a pair of eyes that were as red as fire. Although they didn’t look ugly, they were terrifying. There wasn’t a hint of feminine charm in them.</p>
<p>Her red eyes stared coldly at Zhou Wen as though she was looking at a thief who dared disturb her dreams.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart chilled as he broke out into a cold sweat. A sense of danger arose spontaneously.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen recalled that he was still wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Yet, she could actually see him. Didn’t that mean that the Invisibility Cloak was ineffective against her?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen chose to strike first to gain the upper hand. Tyrant Behemoth roared and charged at the woman on the bed. After it expanded, a fist that was bigger than the bed slammed down violently in a bid to smash the bed and the woman to pieces.</p>
<p>However, before Tyrant Behemoth’s fist landed, the woman on the bed had already sat up and lifted the transparent veil over the bed.</p>
<p>At the instant the veil was lifted, terrifying flames instantly filled the entire world. Zhou Wen failed to react in time and only saw flames fill the screen before the blood-colored avatar died.</p>
<p>What the hell is this? A full-screen instant kill? Zhou Wen launched the game dungeon and wanted to reenter the Fiend Tomb to take a look, but the program icon of the Fiend Tomb dimmed. There was no reaction from tapping it. There was a 24-hour countdown below. The meaning was obvious. He needed 24 hours to enter the Fiend Tomb dungeon again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt somewhat unsatisfied. It wasn’t easy for him to find another Guardian. This might be the opportunity for Slaughterer to advance to a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>I have Banana Fairy, so I might be able to restrain the Guardian’s flames. There’s still a chance of killing her. Zhou Wen thought again. There’s actually a Guardian in the Fiend Tomb. In that case, the Ba that the Zhang family mentioned is actually a Guardian?</p>
<p>The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that it was possible. When he connected the origins of Ba, Zhou Wen increasingly felt that she might be the surviving Guardian of the last Guardian battle.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was beginning to suspect that the battle between Yellow Emperor and Chiyou might have been a battle between Guardians. There must have been many Guardians involved.</p>
<p>The former principal went missing after studying the Zhuolu battlefield. The things he left behind seem to be related to the Zhuolu battle. Could it be that the things the former principal left behind really give people a chance to defeat the Guardians? Zhou Wen thought about the connection.</p>
<p>He first went to grind other dungeons. After a painful wait of twenty-four hours, Zhou Wen entered the Fiend Tomb dungeon again. By then, the Fiend Tomb had returned to its original state.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ordered Tyrant Behemoth to dig up the Fiend Tomb before drawing out the Ghoul Mask. He held the Golden Overlord Sword and slashed at the face in the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>However, just as the blood-colored avatar arrived in front of the Fiend Tomb, it collapsed and died on the spot.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be taken aback as the game screen went black. It would take another twenty-four hours to enter the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>What the hell? Do I have to wait 24 hours after a single death? Isn’t this dungeon too odd? Zhou Wen was extremely helpless.</p>
<h3 id='chapter845'>Chapter 845: Goddess Ba</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Previously, I was fine slashing the human face in the grave while invisible. Now, just walking over means immediate death. From the looks of it, that human face still has some tricks up its sleeve. However, it couldn’t see me the last time I went invisible, so it didn’t trigger its ability, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>It looks like it’s rather difficult to crack Fiend Tomb. The necessary Companion Beasts need Behemoth, Invisibility Cloak, and Truth Listener. If I want to kill the Guardian, I need Companion Beasts that can restrain flames. I need at least four top-notch Mythical Companion Beasts. Where would the typical person get these Companion Beasts? Even the Zhang family will probably find it difficult to have such a lineup that can perfectly counter the Mythical creatures in the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>However, I don’t think I need to fight the Guardian to resolve the Zhang family’s problem. I just need to kill the Ghoul Mask and the Ghost Hornless. Just as Zhou Wen was thinking of how to help Zhang Yuzhi, she called.</p>
<p>“When did you return?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I just came back.” Zhang Yuzhi’s voice revealed her exhaustion before she said apologetically, “Zhou Wen, I’m sorry. I’m afraid things will change at this Earth Elemental Beast Auction.”</p>
<p>“Is the Earth Elemental Beast not going to be auctioned?” Zhou Wen could understand. With such a huge matter happening in the Zhang family, it would be normal for them to not be in the mood to hold an auction.</p>
<p>“The auction will continue and will even be held ahead of time. However, the auction this time won’t be bid using money. Whoever can resolve the problem of the Fiend Tomb can take the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg,” Zhang Yuzhi said.</p>
<p>“So that’s how it is. This isn’t a bad idea.” Zhou Wen was delighted. He already had a certain understanding of the Fiend Tomb. Although he wasn’t certain that he could completely resolve the problem with the Fiend Tomb, there shouldn’t be too much of a problem if he tried a few more times.</p>
<p>He didn’t need to kill the Guardian to resolve the Zhang family’s problem, so he was still very confident. However, he still needed to do a few dungeon runs to confirm it. After ensuring that there were no problems, it wouldn’t be too late to participate in the auction.</p>
<p>“I hope that someone from the other families can resolve the problem with the Fiend Tomb. Otherwise, our Zhang family will really be in danger.” Zhang Yuzhi wasn’t in a good mood. She didn’t chat with Zhou Wen for long before hanging up.</p>
<p>The auction will begin in two days. Time is a little tight, but it should be enough to confirm certain matters. Zhou Wen had already made up his mind to obtain the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that he wanted to help Zhang Yuzhi, even if it was just for the Companion Egg, he had to take action.</p>
<p>However, I have to think of a way. I can’t expose my Companion Beasts, Zhou Wen thought about how to handle this matter to prevent too many Companion Beasts from being exposed.</p>
<p>After all, he needed to use many Companion Beasts for the endeavor. At the very least, Tyrant Behemoth, Truth Listener, and Invisibility Cloak were necessary.</p>
<p>When the Fiend Tomb dungeon could be launched again, Zhou Wen eagerly charged in. This time, Zhou Wen strictly adhered to the procedure.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth dug out the grave to lure out the Ghoul Mask. Zhou Wen went invisible and approached the grave to kill the ghost face. Then, he dug out the Ghost Hornless and used Truth Listener to kill it.</p>
<p>The entire process went perfectly without any problems.</p>
<p>Then, Zhou Wen waited for a period of time. After confirming that the Fiend Stone no longer grew in copious amounts and the ghost face no longer appeared, the Companion Beasts no longer suffered Fiend Stone Petrification, nor did they walk towards the Fiend Tomb by themselves, he felt relieved.</p>
<p>It’s not easy for me to come here. I can’t waste it. I’ll try to see if Banana Fairy can restrain the Guardian’s flames. Zhou Wen got Tyrant Behemoth to continue digging.</p>
<p>Soon, Tyrant Behemoth dug out Ba again. Just like the last time, when the veil was lifted, terrifying flames immediately burned around the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>However, this time, Banana Fairy was beside the blood-colored avatar. Just as the flames lit up, Banana Fairy parted her cherry lips and spat out the Supreme Yin Wind augmented by the Three Realms’ Best Wind.</p>
<p>In an instant, the flames that filled the screen vanished. The speed at which they were extinguished was as though the flames had never appeared.</p>
<p>Even the magma in the Fiend Tomb was wiped out by the Supreme Yin Wind and solidified into rocks.</p>
<p>As for the metal bed, it was sent flying by the Three Realms’ Best Wind. It tumbled into the distance and quickly became a black dot before disappearing. It was unknown how far it was sent flying, but it had already exceeded the limits of what could be seen in-game.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>As expected of the Three Realms’ Best Wind. It’s too powerful! Zhou Wen was overjoyed. Even the Guardian couldn’t withstand a blow from Banana Fairy. It was truly terrifying.</p>
<p>‘Warning… Warning… Goddess Ba transforms into her Terror form… Goddess Ba transforms into her Terror form…’ Just as Zhou Wen was feeling delighted, a red warning suddenly appeared in-game. It was like a warning siren that constantly flashed, giving people a visual sense of danger.</p>
<p>Terror form… What is it? Zhou Wen was momentarily taken aback. He felt that this Terror form had something to do with the Mythical stage’s Terror grade.</p>
<p>He remembered that the silver-haired Companion Beast had said that most Mythical creatures that appeared on Earth were likely at the Terror grade, but it hadn’t said anything about the Terror form.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was puzzled, he saw the scarlet flames burn half the sky red. A red figure that resembled a ghost god tore through the air at an unbelievable speed.</p>
<p>Wherever the red figure went, everything around it turned into flames. Even the air and mountains burned.</p>
<p>As he was extremely far away, Zhou Wen didn’t manage to see the figure clearly at first. However, she came too quickly and could be seen in the blink of an eye. It was likely Goddess Ba, but the current Goddess Ba was very different from before.</p>
<p>Now, Goddess Ba’s entire body was burning with terrifying flames. These flames weren’t burning outside her body, but through her entire body. Every inch of her muscles, every bone, and every tiny cell seemed to be burning with blood-red flames.</p>
<p>It was as if her entire body was condensed from flames. Her hair was like fire threads, and her eyes were like fire pupils. She was like a fire demoness that had walked out of a myth, emitting a terrifying and dangerous aura. Due to her arrival, the entire valley burned. The river instantly dried up, and the ground was red like purgatory.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could sense that the power in her body was unimaginably terrifying. It was something he had never seen on any creature or Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth roared as it soared into the sky. Its huge fist struck at the levitating Goddess Ba. With the augmentation of Absolute Strength, its strike could shatter mountains.</p>
<p>However, Goddess Ba only looked coldly at Tyrant Behemoth without any intention of attacking. Tyrant Behemoth’s terrifying strike failed to touch her body. It didn’t even break the flames outside the Goddess Ba’s body as invisible flames held back its fist.</p>
<h3 id='chapter846'>Chapter 846: Terror Transformation</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The flames on Goddess Ba’s body surged as Tyrant Behemoth’s huge body immediately transformed into a fireball. Terrifying flames rapidly burned its body. Tyrant Behemoth couldn’t withstand the flames even with its physical strength.</p>
<p>The entire valley plunged into a sea of flames. Due to Banana Fairy blowing out the Supreme Yin Wind, she was barely able to prevent the blood-colored avatar from being burned by the flames.</p>
<p>However, without the augmentation of the Three Realms’ Best Wind, the Supreme Yin Wind was clearly no match for the flames. It was being rapidly devoured by the flames.</p>
<p>Seeing that Tyrant Behemoth was about to be burned to death, Zhou Wen hurriedly summoned Torch Dragon Youngling and used Bright Torch Vision World on Goddess Ba. However, in Torch Dragon Youngling’s eyes, there was only a sea of fire with no sign of Goddess Ba. Goddess Ba stood there without being sucked into the Vision World.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, what’s this? Even Bright Torch Vision World is useless? Is it because of the Terror form? Zhou Wen was alarmed. Without waiting for him to think further, the sea of flames had already devoured the blood-colored avatar and the game screen went black.</p>
<p>What a terrifying Terror form. Is this the true power of a Terror-grade Mythical creature? Zhou Wen felt that Goddess Ba was the most terrifying creature he had ever seen.</p>
<p>Even the two Guardians of Ant City and the underground sea aren’t that terrifying. I wonder if they have a Terror form. Zhou Wen guessed that they didn’t have one. At the very least, he had never seen them before.</p>
<p>If there is anyone else with a Terror form, it’s probably the one inside the Forbidden City’s log. She might have a Terror form.</p>
<p>The chances of new Guardians who hadn’t come out of the cocoons having a Terror form were relatively low.</p>
<p>How did this Terror form come about? Can Companion Beasts have such a form? Zhou Wen thought about it but couldn’t figure it out.</p>
<p>He suddenly thought of The Thearch and thought to himself, Could The Thearch also have a Terror form?</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen sent a message to The Thearch: “The Thearch, can I ask you a question? Are you a Terror-grade expert?”</p>
<p>He originally didn’t expect a reply, but The Thearch surprisingly replied shortly after. “Not bad. You even know about the Terror-grade. What else do you know?”</p>
<p>“I also know the existence of the Terror form. You should be an existence at that level, right?” Zhou Wen said after some hesitation.</p>
<p>“A Terror form is nothing. To you humans, the Terror grade means invincibility, but in front of me, the Terror grade is trash,” The Thearch said in contempt. “You must have encountered a fellow with a Terror form. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have asked me.”</p>
<p>“You are wise.” Zhou Wen flattered her, hoping that she would say more.</p>
<p>The Thearch didn’t disappoint and sent another message. “In theory, Mythical creatures with a Terror form are considered true Mythical creatures. However, the Terror form isn’t something all Mythical creatures can possess. It depends on their bloodline talent and comprehension abilities. Typical Guardians can have a Terror form as long as they continue fighting and evolving. However, for dimensional creatures, only the top ones can have a Terror form.”</p>
<p>“What exactly is a Terror form?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>The Thearch replied, “What do you think the difference between the Mythical stage and the typical Epic and Legendary stages is?”</p>
<p>“Basic stats and Wheel of Destiny,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“The Wheel of Destiny can indeed allow Mythical creatures to possess a powerful ability, but no matter how powerful it is, it’s only an ability. This isn’t a qualitative difference. From the perspective of dimensional creatures, being able to undergo a Terror transformation is the most important indicator of the differentiation between the levels of creatures. There’s no distinction between Legendary and Epic in dimensional zones because such creatures are too weak. They don’t have the qualifications to be categorized. There are only two ways to be truly categorized. A dimensional creature that can undergo Terror transformation and a dimensional creature that can’t. This is the first level of categorization for dimensional creatures.”</p>
<p>“I still don’t understand what kind of power the Terror form is.” Zhou Wen still didn’t understand.</p>
<p>The Thearch added, “Of course you don’t understand. That’s because that’s the true Mythical realm. If you haven’t reached that realm, you naturally won’t understand. To put it simply, the so-called God is an indescribable thing. It’s an unknown thing that makes humans feel terrified. If humans can defeat creatures with their strength, they won’t be called gods. The Terror form is an indescribable state. After the Terror transformation, no matter how strong a mortal is, it’s impossible for them to injure the body that has undergone Terror transformation. Only a Terror form can defeat a Terror form.”</p>
<p>“Then how can Terror transformation be achieved?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“It’s impossible for you humans to undergo Terror transformation. Only by signing a contract with a Guardian and using the Guardian’s power to advance to the Mythical stage will you have the qualifications to undergo a Terror transformation,” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>“Why can’t humans advance to the Mythical stage?” Zhou Wen couldn’t understand why only humans couldn’t advance to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>“Let me give you an analogy. Don’t you humans have something called comics? The characters in those comics are called two-dimensional creatures by you. As for you humans, you are three-dimensional creatures. No matter how powerful the characters in the comics are, do you think they can become three-dimensional creatures like humans? Of course, this is just an example. It’s not completely accurate, but the actual situation isn’t much different. Therefore, no matter how powerful the characters in the comics are, they can’t injure three-dimensional creatures. As for three-dimensional creatures, they can easily destroy two-dimensional creatures. This is why only the Terror grade can defeat the Terror grade. After the Terror transformation, they are no longer existences on the same level. There’s no comparison,” The Thearch explained.</p>
<p>Is humanity really hopeless? Zhou Wen couldn’t believe that humans couldn’t advance to the Mythical stage. At the very least, Xia Jiuhuang had succeeded, although his methods were very cruel.</p>
<p>The Thearch replied, “Of course there’s hope. Contracting a Guardian or becoming one with a Guardian like Wang Mingyuan. Only these two paths are possible.”</p>
<p>“I’ve seen a human before. He relied on himself to advance to the Mythical stage,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>The Thearch’s reply was filled with contempt. “You’re talking about the one in Forbidden City, right? Do you think that he could have advanced to the Mythical stage by his strength alone if it wasn’t for the help of Starlady Polestar?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. Back then, Xia Jiuhuang had indeed used the power in the log to condense the final Life Providence and Life Soul. With the help of the purple lightning, he had advanced to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>“There are only these two paths for humans. Have you considered which one you want to take? If you want to contract a Guardian, I can help you. I can help you contract an extremely powerful Guardian. It’s definitely not inferior to Starlady Polestar,” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>“I still want to see if I can advance to the Mythical stage with my own strength,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Then take your time. It won’t be too late to find me when you reach a dead end.” The Thearch wasn’t angry this time. She seemed to be certain that Zhou Wen couldn’t advance to the Mythical stage with his own strength.</p>
<h3 id='chapter847'>Chapter 847: Gathering at Fiend Tomb</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>After waiting for twenty-four hours, Zhou Wen entered the Fiend Tomb dungeon again. This time, he naturally didn’t dare provoke the Goddess Ba. All he did was eliminate the Ghoul Mask and Ghost Hornless. Then, he didn’t take further action. He maintained this state and observed if there were any other abnormalities around the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>There were no more problems with the Fiend Tomb even when Zhang Yuzhi invited him to participate in the so-called auction. As long as he didn’t continue digging, Goddess Ba wouldn’t wake up.</p>
<p>The auction was originally planned to be held in Dragon Tiger Town, but it had been changed to a temporary encampment near the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>Those who were invited were basically the best in the Federation. The members of the six families were all present, so the Cape family naturally didn’t look happy when they saw Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The other families didn’t have much of a relationship with Zhou Wen. Instead, people from the North District’s Ultimate Family Clan took the initiative to greet him.</p>
<p>“Lance often mentions you and wishes to have a serious battle with you. If you have the time in the future, why don’t you pay a visit to the North District?” the elder from the Ultimate Family Clan said to Zhou Wen with a smile.</p>
<p>“I’ll definitely go if I have the chance in the future.” Zhou Wen had long had thought about the dimensional zones in the North District, but they were too far away, so he hadn’t gone.</p>
<p>However, now that Fine Dust needed him to take untaken paths to advance, he couldn’t avoid heading out more often in the future. It was a good opportunity to make a trip to the North District.</p>
<p>After chatting for a while, the person in charge of the Zhang family came over and began speaking.</p>
<p>It was similar to what Zhang Chunqiu had said. It roughly meant that the Zhang family wouldn’t charge any form of money for the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg. As long as they could help the Zhang family resolve the problem of the Fiend Tomb, they could take away the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg.</p>
<p>In fact, most people already knew the news in advance, so they weren’t surprised. After all, such a huge matter had happened to the Zhang family. It was impossible to keep it under wraps.</p>
<p>“Brother Zhang, we roughly know about the situation in the Fiend Tomb. However, there are some things that we can’t produce a solution for unless we see them with our own eyes,” the Dugu family’s representative, Dugu Wenxin, said.</p>
<p>“In a while, I’ll take all of you to the Fiend Tomb to view it. However, there’s something I want to make clear to everyone. The Fiend Tomb is extremely strange. Anyone who goes there might be struck by some unknown power. Who knows when they might unknowingly walk towards the Fiend Tomb and become a lifeless Fiend Stone Statue. Therefore, the people who go will face certain danger. We leave it up to you to decide. If something happens because of this, the Zhang family will not be held responsible,” the person in charge of the Zhang family said.</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Moses.</p>
<p>Most people expressed their willingness to take the risk. Only a small number of people stayed back.</p>
<p>The Zhang family produced a contract and got all who were willing to take the risk to sign it. Only then did they take the people who had signed the contract to the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was one of them. He was determined to obtain the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg, so he naturally couldn’t let go of this opportunity.</p>
<p>“You’ve already been there. It’s not like you don’t know the dangers there. Why are you still going?” When the others set off for the Fiend Tomb, Zhou Wen was stopped by Zhang Yuzhi.</p>
<p>“I’ve thought of a way. Perhaps it can eliminate the influence of the Fiend Tomb, so I want to give it a try,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“What method is it?” Zhang Yuzhi asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t hide it. “I want to dig open the Fiend Tomb and eliminate the dimensional creatures inside. That way, I can naturally eliminate the negative effects.”</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi immediately shook her head and said, “You can’t do that. My ancestral Celestial Master said that if we release the creatures in the Fiend Tomb, it will definitely cause a calamity for the Zhang family. Our Zhang family has suppressed the Fiend Tomb for so many years, precisely because we do not want that to happen. How can we dig open the Fiend Tomb for our own selfish reasons?”</p>
<p>“According to my observations, there shouldn’t be only one terrifying creature in the Fiend Tomb. The one that’s affecting your Zhang family shouldn’t be the Ba that the ancestral Celestial Master mentioned. As long as we don’t alarm the Ba, we can dig shallowly into the Fiend Tomb and kill the dimensional creatures that are affecting your Zhang family,” Zhou Wen explained.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi shook her head with a bitter smile. “Who knows what will happen if we touch the Fiend Tomb? Perhaps the terrifying creatures inside will escape. The consequences would be unimaginable. I’m afraid my family’s elders won’t agree to that.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen fell silent. He was already having so much difficulty convincing Zhang Yuzhi, so it would probably be even more difficult to convince the elders of the Zhang family. He couldn’t reveal the fact that he knew about the Fiend Tomb’s situation, so it would be troublesome to convince them.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen could only take one step at a time. He was unwilling to give up the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg no matter what.</p>
<p>After witnessing the horror of the Terror transformation, if one encountered such a terrifying existence before they had the strength to fight it, the only option was to run.</p>
<p>As for the Earth Elemental Beast, it was undoubtedly the best weapon for escaping. It was highly likely that he would have to rely on it.</p>
<p>Of course, it was best if he didn’t encounter a creature that was capable of Terror transformation. However, if he did, he needed a way to survive.</p>
<p>In the future, more and more Guardians would appear. There would definitely be more Guardians with the ability of Terror transformation. Even more terrifying dimensional creatures might appear as well.</p>
<p>If it was really as the silver-haired Companion Beast said, the combination of a human and a Guardian might produce a Calamity-grade powerhouse, it would be even more terrifying.</p>
<p>To be so terrifying at the Terror grade, Zhou Wen couldn’t imagine what kind of power a Calamity had.</p>
<p>As Zhang Yuzhi wasn’t allowed to go to the Fiend Tomb, Zhou Wen had no choice but to chase after the group alone and follow the others.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu had been guarding the Fiend Tomb recently. When Zhou Wen and company arrived, Zhang Chunqiu welcomed them and took them to the stone platform.</p>
<p>This stone platform had a huge backstory. It had been built by the ancestral Celestial Master. Up to today, it hadn’t been petrified by the Fiend Stones. The ground and mountain walls beneath the stone platform had long been petrified by the Fiend Stones. Only these eight stone platforms were safe.</p>
<p>Most of the people who had come were from the other five families. Some of them were from famous local wealthy families and famous freelance hunters.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at them for a while, but he didn’t find Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Liu Yun probably won’t give up easily. If he’s not here, does he plan on stealing the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg? Zhou Wen was somewhat suspicious.</p>
<p>The others had already begun studying the problem of the Fiend Stones. They had already obtained detailed information from the Zhang family. Now was the time to showcase their abilities.</p>
<p>Some people summoned their Companion Beasts and tried to see if they could avoid being petrified. Others wanted to use some kind of power to cleanse the mountain walls and people.</p>
<p>An elder of the Cape family summoned a crucifix. After praying, the crucifix emitted a holy light and shone it at the Zhang family members who had turned into Fiend Stone statues. However, it was useless. The Fiend Stones weren’t purified.</p>
<h3 id='chapter848'>Chapter 848: Fighting for an Opportunity</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>It had to be said that the six families and the local wealthy families had rich heritage. Their means and various Companion Beasts broadened Zhou Wen’s horizons.</p>
<p>Some of the Companion Beasts and abilities really worked.</p>
<p>An elder from the Cape family summoned a book-shaped Companion Beast. When the book’s page flipped open, a shadow appeared on it. It was the blurry shadow of the Ghoul Mask.</p>
<p>There were also some Companion Beasts that could move across the Fiend Stones without being petrified. Everyone was trying their best to find a solution to the problem.</p>
<p>These fellows sure are capable. Don’t tell me they can really resolve the problem with the Fiend Tomb? Zhou Wen immediately felt a sense of danger.</p>
<p>He had worked so hard for the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg. It would be terrible if someone else beat him to it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and found Zhang Chunqiu. He whispered, “I’ve thought of a way to resolve the problem of the Fiend Tomb. I just need to dig it up.”</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu shook his head and said, “You can’t dig up the Fiend Tomb. Even if I agree, the elders in my family won’t agree, much less the Celestial Master.”</p>
<p>“If we don’t dig open the Fiend Tomb, I’m afraid it will be very difficult to resolve the problem. However, you can rest assured. After my investigations, there’s not only a Ba in the Fiend Tomb. There are other dimensional creatures on the periphery. We just need to dig open a portion of the Fiend Tomb and eliminate those dimensional creatures. I’m confident that I won’t disturb Ba,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu pondered for a moment and said, “It’s useless even if I believe you. This is the teachings of the ancestral Celestial Master. The Zhang family has protected it for generations, and we won’t dare violate it, or the Zhang family will definitely be wiped out. Even for the Zhang family, the elders in the family will never allow anyone to touch the Fiend Tomb.”</p>
<p>“But the Zhang family will also suffer if we don’t touch the Fiend Tomb. At this point in time, we have to take the risk, right?” Zhou Wen still wanted to move Zhang Chunqiu.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu stared at Zhou Wen and asked, “Are you really confident? You have to be absolutely certain. If any accident happens, our Zhang family will be doomed.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that Zhang Chunqiu hoped that he could produce some powerful evidence, but how could Zhou Wen produce any? He couldn’t just switch on his phone and farm the Fiend Tomb for them to see.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said, “To be honest, I have a special ability to see through things. I can see the situation in the Fiend Tomb clearly, so I’m very confident about this matter.”</p>
<p>“You can see through the Fiend Tomb?” Zhang Chunqiu looked at Zhou Wen in surprise.</p>
<p>In fact, the Zhang family also had Companion Beasts with penetrative vision. Furthermore, it wasn’t just one. However, none of the Companion Beasts’ penetrative vision worked on the Fiend Tomb. They were unable to see its interior.</p>
<p>This didn’t mean that the Companion Beasts’ penetrative vision wasn’t strong, but that the sleeping Goddess Ba was too powerful. It wasn’t easy to see through the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>Even some Companion Beasts with the ability to predict the future could only roughly predict the Ghoul Mask at the top. Furthermore, the scenes they predicted were blurry, just like the one produced by the Cape family’s elder.</p>
<p>“There are a total of three levels in the Fiend Tomb. The first level is the mask. I reckon that the ghost face and the power of the Fiend Stone Petrification are produced because of that ghost face. The second level is a strange creature. It looks like a snake and dragon, but it’s neither. The reason behind the Zhang family members involuntarily walking towards the Fiend Tomb is probably due to its enticement. The third level is the Ba that your Zhang family is suppressing and protecting, but we don’t have to alarm her. All we need to do is dig up the Fiend Tomb and eliminate the two dimensional creatures. Then, we can resolve your family’s problem.” Zhou Wen explained the general situation.</p>
<p>He wasn’t afraid that the Zhang family would go back on their word. Even if he told them what was down there, it wouldn’t be easy to kill the Ghoul Mask and Ghost Hornless. Many people might even die.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Wen needed to use Tyrant Behemoth, Truth Listener, and the Invisibility Cloak to kill them.</p>
<p>Seeing how detailed Zhou Wen was, Zhang Chunqiu couldn’t help but believe him. After some thought, he said, “That may be the case, but no one can guarantee that opening the Fiend Tomb won’t alarm the Ba at the bottom. Furthermore, we know nothing about the two dimensional creatures above. It won’t be easy to kill them.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Zhang Chunqiu continued, “To be honest, our Zhang family can also deduce that there are dimensional creatures in the Fiend Tomb. However, due to the orders of the ancestral Celestial Master, no one dares to touch the Fiend Tomb. Therefore, this matter will probably be very difficult to facilitate. How about this? Give me some time and let me give it a try. I’ll think of a way to convince my elders.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen could only wait for Zhang Chunqiu’s news.</p>
<p>The Zhang family’s current Celestial Master was Zhang Chunqiu’s second uncle, Zhang Siyou. At this moment, Zhang Siyou was talking to the Cape family and the Family Clan of Gods.</p>
<p>“Chunqiu, you came at the right time. Old Mister Charlie and Moses have found a way to eliminate the influence of the Fiend Tomb. Come and listen too.” Zhang Siyou beckoned Zhang Chunqiu over.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu bowed slightly and stood behind Zhang Siyou.</p>
<p>Although he wanted to talk about Zhou Wen, it wasn’t convenient for him to say it in front of so many people. All he could do was wait patiently.</p>
<p>“Celestial Master, as I said just now, all the strange things in the Fiend Tomb are a result of that mask. To remove the mask without digging open the Fiend Tomb, only our Cape family’s Great Divination Theurgy can do it…” Charlie Sr. said slowly.</p>
<p>Zhang Siyou listened quietly without commenting. After Old Charlie finished speaking, he looked at Moses and the other members of the Family Clan of Gods.</p>
<p>Moses said, “I can’t agree with Old Mister Charlie. There’s indeed a mask in the Fiend Tomb, but the Great Divination Theurgy might not be useful. If you are willing to let me do it, I definitely won’t disappoint you.”</p>
<p>“Then I want to hear what abilities you have that are better than our Cape family’s Great Divination,” Charlie said coldly.</p>
<p>Moses didn’t say anything. He summoned a terrifying giant.</p>
<p>Unlike the typical barbaric and primitive giant, this giant was wearing glorious armor. He was like a giant god that protected the world. He had an incomparable aura as though he could crush the earth with a single step and shatter the stars with a single punch.</p>
<p>“This is my Guardian, the Giant God Sovereign. With his strength, it won’t be difficult for him to kill the mask in the Fiend Tomb,” said Moses.</p>
<p>Everyone’s gaze was attracted by the Giant God Sovereign. Although many people already knew of the existence of Guardians, not many had actually seen one.</p>
<p>“No matter how strong a Guardian is, it’s impossible for them to destroy the mask inside the Fiend Tomb, right? You still have to dig open the Fiend Tomb in the end, isn’t that so?” Charlie remained unmoved as he sneered.</p>
<p>Moses said unhurriedly, “That might not be the case. The power that the Giant God Sovereign possesses is unimaginable to ordinary people. Even if we don’t dig open the Fiend Tomb, we can still destroy the mask inside. I can guarantee that I won’t damage the Fiend Tomb. If the Fiend Tomb is damaged in any way, the Celestial Master doesn’t have to pay me with the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter849'>Chapter 849: My Method</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Although Moses and the rest were not on the stone platform, Giant God Sovereign was so huge that the people on the stone platforms also saw the terrifying body of Giant God Sovereign.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw Giant God Sovereign, his eyes lit up. He could already smell the aura of the Guardian. Without a doubt, it was another Guardian.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still no match for the super powerful Guardians, but not every Guardian was that strong. Perhaps this Giant God Sovereign was about the same strength as the six-winged seraphim?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to take another look, but Moses had already unsummoned the Guardian.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and suddenly frowned. Don’t tell me that fellow wants to use the Guardian’s power to touch the Fiend Tomb? Isn’t that courting death?</p>
<p>When Guardians descended on Earth, they represented different dimensional races in battle. They were enemies against each other. Now, they were using one Guardian to blast the place where another Guardian was sleeping. It was obvious what would happen next.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, Goddess Ba sleeping in the Fiend Tomb would most likely go berserk. When that happened, the Zhang family wouldn’t be the only ones to suffer. Everyone would die.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wish to die, nor did he wish for Zhang Yuzhi’s family to be destroyed. Therefore, he was already considering how he could stop the Zhang family if they really agreed to let the Guardian attack the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>Zhang Siyou was still considering Charlie’s and Moses’s suggestions. Two different solutions seemed to be worth a try, but at the same time, it was difficult to say which method would really work.</p>
<p>Both arguments had their merits. They hoped that the Zhang family could use their plans.</p>
<p>“Chunqiu, what do you think?” Zhang Siyou looked at Zhang Chunqiu and asked.</p>
<p>When Zhang Chunqiu was young, he had already helped his family to guard the Fiend Tomb. Furthermore, Zhang Siyou had the intention of grooming him into the Zhang family’s next Celestial Master. By asking Zhang Chunqiu now, not only did he want to know his opinion, but he also wanted to test him.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu thought for a moment and bowed to Zhang Siyou. “Celestial Master, if possible, I wish to hear more plans before making a decision.”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, other than our two families, no one has discovered the mask in the Fiend Tomb, much less come up with a solution to getting rid of it without damaging the Fiend Tomb,” said Moses.</p>
<p>Zhang Siyou looked at Zhang Chunqiu thoughtfully and asked, “Are there any other plans?”</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu hurriedly said, “Zhou Wen, who represents Luoyang’s An family, also has a plan that can resolve the problem of the Fiend Tomb. Why don’t you listen to it first?”</p>
<p>“Is that Yuzhi’s friend?” Zhang Siyou clearly knew who Zhou Wen was.</p>
<p>“Yes, Yuzhi has a good relationship with Zhou Wen. She even saved Zhou Wen before. He has no ill intentions towards the Zhang family,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“Then invite him over to get him to tell me his plan,” Zhang Siyou said after some thought.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu hurriedly agreed and went to look for Zhou Wen. Just as Zhang Chunqiu left, Charlie said, “Celestial Master, that Zhou Wen is just a kid with some luck. Don’t tell me you really believe him and are leaving such an important matter to him? This concerns the fate of the Zhang family. Please be careful!”</p>
<p>“There’s no harm in listening to more opinions. In the end, we’ll use the proposal that’s better,” Zhang Siyou said calmly.</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhang Siyou had made his decision, Charlie and Moses didn’t say anything else.</p>
<p>When Zhang Chunqiu saw Zhou Wen, he explained the situation in detail. He still believed Zhou Wen. After all, not only did Zhou Wen see the mask, but he also knew that there was a monster beneath it, as well as Ba further down.</p>
<p>As for Charlie and Moses, they had only discovered the topmost mask.</p>
<p>If he really wanted to give it a try, Zhang Chunqiu was more willing to believe Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“They only discovered the mask. Ignoring the question of whether they can remove the mask, even if they can, the monster below is still there. It’s useless to remove the mask.” Zhou Wen paused for a moment and said to Zhang Chunqiu with a heavy expression, “Furthermore, I suspect that the Ba down there is actually a Guardian. We don’t know what the relationship between the Guardians is. If they are enemies, it will probably cause huge trouble if Moses uses a Guardian to attack the Fiend Tomb.”</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu frowned when he heard that. He asked, “Are you sure Ba is a Guardian?”</p>
<p>“I can’t be sure. After all, I can only see a portion of it through my penetrative vision. However, Ba does look like a Guardian,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“If there’s really such a possibility, we can’t let Moses try regardless. We can’t take such a risk.” Zhang Chunqiu had already made up his mind. He brought Zhou Wen along and said, “Follow me to the Celestial Master. Try your best to fight for an opportunity. I’ll help you from the side.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” Zhou Wen agreed and followed Zhang Chunqiu to Zhang Siyou’s side.</p>
<p>“Greetings, Celestial Master. I’m Zhou Wen.” Zhou Wen bowed at Zhang Siyou.</p>
<p>In the past, the Zhang family’s Hero King was the leader of the six heroes. Now, every Zhang family’s Celestial Master had a very special status in the Federation. Even the Senators of the six families were respectful in front of the Celestial Master, not daring to slight him.</p>
<p>“Since you are Yuzhi’s friend, there’s no need to stand on ceremony with me. I often hear Yuzhi mention you. I can tell that you are indeed a young hero.” Zhang Siyou sized up Zhou Wen and continued, “I heard that you also have a way to eliminate the influence of the Fiend Tomb. Can you elaborate?”</p>
<p>“My method is actually very simple. It’s to dig open the Fiend Tomb and kill the dimensional creatures inside. Only then can I completely resolve the problem of the Fiend Tomb,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>When he said that, not only did many members of the Zhang family frown, but Charlie even said disdainfully, “If we could dig up the Fiend Tomb, why would the Zhang family invite you over with their means and abilities?”</p>
<p>Zhang Siyou didn’t directly object to Zhou Wen’s suggestion. All he did was look at him and say, “Why don’t you tell me why you insist on digging up the Fiend Tomb?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen said calmly, “I have a penetrative skill. I can roughly tell that the Fiend Tomb is split into three levels. The first level has a mask, the second level is a monster, and the third level is the creature that your family has been guarding. If I want to completely resolve the problem of the Fiend Tomb, I have to eliminate the mask on the first level and the monster on the second level. If I don’t dig up the Fiend Tomb, I really don’t have the ability to eliminate both.”</p>
<p>“What a joke. The Zhang family has the power of the Heavenly Eye. Even the Zhang family can’t see through the Fiend Tomb, but you can see it clearly. You even know that it’s split into three levels. Could it be that your ability to see through things is even more powerful than the Zhang family’s Heavenly Eye? I’m afraid you heard what we said and know that there’s a mask in the Fiend Tomb. You are using this information to be an alarmist, hoping to benefit from it, right?” Charlie said with a sneer.</p>
<p>“The Celestial Master will be able to determine the veracity of my information.” Zhou Wen didn’t argue with Charlie. He turned to Zhang Siyou and said, “Celestial Master, if you want me to do it, I have to dig open the Fiend Tomb. There’s no other way.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter850'>Chapter 850: Killing the Ghoul Mask</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Celestial Master, I don’t think there’s a need to waste time, right? It’s naturally impossible to dig up the Fiend Tomb. It looks like you can only choose between me and Old Mister Charlie,” said Moses.</p>
<p>After hearing Moses say that, Zhou Wen suddenly said, “Celestial Master, if I were you, I definitely wouldn’t choose to use the power of a Guardian.”</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, what are you trying to imply?” Moses and the members of the Family Clan of Gods glared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhang Siyou looked at Zhou Wen with interest.</p>
<p>“It’s not convenient for me to explain the exact reason in public. I’ve already told Zhang Chunqiu. It’s best if he explains it to you in private,” Zhou Wen said as he deliberately glanced at Moses.</p>
<p>Originally, he had thought of a better solution, but he chose the easiest method to anger Moses and the Family Clan of Gods. This was because he needed an excuse to kill Giant God Sovereign.</p>
<p>Now, Moses and the members of the Family Clan of Gods looked at Zhou Wen with extremely unfriendly gazes.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu used a secret message to convey the reason Zhou Wen had mentioned to Zhang Siyou. After hearing it, Zhang Siyou looked at Zhou Wen and asked, “Are you sure about the matter regarding Giant God Sovereign?”</p>
<p>“I can’t be sure, but if it were me, I wouldn’t take such a risk,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Celestial Master, please don’t listen to his nonsense. I know my Guardian best. There definitely won’t be a problem,” Moses explained. Although he didn’t know what Zhou Wen had said to the Zhang family, he knew that there was nothing good about it.</p>
<p>“Please calm down. We need some time to discuss. Please wait for a moment.” After Zhang Siyou finished speaking, he got someone to lead the three parties away, leaving only the members of the Zhang family behind to begin a discussion.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, do you dare accept my challenge?” Moses asked Zhou Wen coldly.</p>
<p>“You are just relying on a Guardian. It’s nothing impressive. Why wouldn’t I dare?” Zhou Wen replied arrogantly.</p>
<p>“Very well. After this matter is over, I will definitely fight you. You won’t escape then,” Moses said with a sullen expression.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid you will be the one to escape when the time comes.” Zhou Wen remained as arrogant as ever.</p>
<p>Moses didn’t say anything else. After all, this was an important area in the Zhang family. It was impossible for him to fight Zhou Wen here. It was useless to say anything now. All he could do was wait until he left.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The Zhang family was in an intense discussion. Naturally, Zhang Chunqiu strongly recommended Zhou Wen, but due to the teachings of the ancestral Celestial Master, many elders of the Zhang family didn’t agree to digging up the tomb.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu’s uncle was especially against it.</p>
<p>“If we really want to dig up the tomb, our Zhang family has countless experts. Why would we need to rely on outsiders?” This was what most of the Zhang family members thought.</p>
<p>The reason they were willing to hire someone’s help with the Earth Elemental Beast as compensation was because they hoped to resolve the problem without touching the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>“Uncles, Zhou Wen can see through the Fiend Tomb. Only he knows where the Fiend Tomb can be dug and where it can’t be dug. Uncles, you should know the dangers of the Fiend Tomb better than me. We can’t take such risks,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“There are also risk-free solutions. Charlie and Moses do not need to dig open Fiend Tomb, so there’s no risk at all. Even if it’s really as Zhou Wen said and there’s a Guardian down there, making it inconvenient to use a Guardian to blast open Fiend Tomb, we can still choose Charlie. Furthermore, saying that Ba is a Guardian isn’t believable at all. When he first came, he couldn’t see any problems. Now that he’s here, he has figured everything out. It’s a little unbelievable,” Uncle Zhang said.</p>
<p>“Uncle…” Zhang Chunqiu wanted to say something, but he was interrupted by Uncle Zhang.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to say anything else. The ancestral teachings are unbreakable. Ancestral Celestial Master has already made it clear that if the Fiend Tomb is touched, our Zhang family will definitely perish. No matter what, I don’t agree to digging up the tomb.”</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu was helpless. No matter what he said, he couldn’t move the elders of the Zhang family.</p>
<p>After waiting for a while, the Zhang family finally finished their discussion. Zhang Siyou led the Zhang family out and said to the three of them, “After our discussion, we have decided to get Mr. Charlie to help us solve the problem of the Fiend Tomb. If Mr. Charlie can’t solve the problem of the Fiend Tomb, we will trouble the other two to help us.”</p>
<p>“Celestial Master, that’s a wise choice.” Charlie smiled like a gentleman, but he couldn’t hide the smugness in his eyes.</p>
<p>Moses and company glared at Zhou Wen, clearly believing that he had hindered them. Otherwise, they would have been the ones to obtain this opportunity.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I’ve tried my best,” Zhang Chunqiu walked to Zhou Wen’s side and said apologetically.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. The Cape family might not be able to succeed. There might still be a chance.” Zhou Wen felt that since Charlie couldn’t even see the Ghost Hornless below, the chances of him resolving the problem with Fiend Tomb were slim.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if he wasn’t careful, he might even lose his life there. After all, the Ghoul Mask and the Ghost Hornless’s abilities were too strange. Even Zhou Wen would be killed if he wasn’t careful. It probably wouldn’t be easy for Old Mister Charlie to return alive.</p>
<p>As the two of them spoke, Uncle Zhang walked past them and glanced at Zhou Wen. Then, he said to Zhang Chunqiu, “Don’t mention digging up the tomb again. As long as my old bones are still around, I won’t let anyone harm our Zhang family.”</p>
<p>“Uncle…” Zhang Chunqiu wanted to say something, but Uncle Zhang had already waved his hand and gone.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. My uncle was only afraid that something would happen to the Zhang family because of the ancestral Celestial Master’s orders. He doesn’t have any intention of targeting you,” Zhang Chunqiu said helplessly to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“That’s nothing. However, I think your uncle seems to have some misunderstanding about me. I’m afraid that if Charlie doesn’t succeed, they will be willing to give Moses a chance and not me,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I definitely won’t let that happen,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a firm expression.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out when he had offended the old man to make him look down on him.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu thought for a moment and said, “Didn’t you happen to bump into my uncle the last time you were here? I think this might have something to do with you saying that you didn’t discover anything.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was enlightened. The elder originally imagined that he was here to mess around and didn’t have any true abilities.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>On the other side, Charlie had already begun taking action. Zhou Wen and Zhang Chunqiu went to the stone platforms. Zhou Wen also wanted to see what the Great Divination Theurgy was.</p>
<p>Charlie produced a pair of angel wings on his back and flew to the front of the Fiend Tomb. He stopped outside the demarcating line and summoned two Companion Beasts. One was a crucifix, and the other was a book.</p>
<p>As the book opened, light beams shot out from the book’s surface, gradually condensing into the shape of a Ghoul Mask. Although it was a little blurry, Zhou Wen could tell that it was undoubtedly the Ghoul Mask.</p>
<p>This old man is quite capable, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, the moment the Ghoul Mask’s shadow condensed, the crucifix in his other hand emitted a terrifying holy light. He used the crucifix as a sword and stabbed into the Ghoul Mask’s shadow.</p>
<p>The Ghoul Mask’s shadow immediately shattered the crucifix, turning into specks of light that dissipated. At the same time, there was a cracking sound from the Fiend Tomb as though something had shattered.</p>
<h3 id='chapter851'>Chapter 851: One Person Is Enough</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw this scene, he knew that Charlie was doomed.</p>
<p>His book and the crucifix’s abilities were indeed powerful, but he didn’t know that the mask wasn’t the crux of the problem. Destroying the mask alone was useless. Instead, it might put him in danger.</p>
<p>Indeed, after a commotion in the Fiend Tomb, grayish-white dust spewed out.</p>
<p>When Charlie saw the dust, his expression changed slightly. The book and crucifix in his hand glowed again. He wanted to repel the dust, but the dust was like smoke. Repelling the smoke on one side would have the smoke on the other side sweep over and spray on Charlie’s face.</p>
<p>Everything happened so quickly that even the Cape family couldn’t stop it. By the time they reacted, the dust had already condensed into a mask on Charlie’s face.</p>
<p>When the Cape family rushed forward to help Charlie, the crucifix in Charlie’s hand had a shocking glow. It stabbed the two Cape family members who wanted to help him.</p>
<p>The two of them were caught off guard. After being injured by Charlie, they fell to the ground and their bodies quickly turned into Fiend Stones. Everyone was shocked.</p>
<p>However, Charlie, who was controlled by the Ghoul Mask, didn’t care. He waved the book and crucifix in his hand and charged at the humans on the stone platform.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu suddenly attacked. His sword slashed like a stream of light, instantly shattering the mask on Charlie’s face. However, it didn’t injure Charlie’s face. The precision of his sword technique was shocking.</p>
<p>However, it was useless. The shattered mask quickly reformed and covered Charlie’s face again.</p>
<p>Everyone fought Charlie, but it wasn’t good enough to injure him. Even attacking the mask on his face was useless. Instantly, everyone was in disarray.</p>
<p>In the end, Zhang Siyou produced a talisman and stuck it to the Ghoul Mask, causing Charlie to stand there motionless. However, the mask could not be removed from his face.</p>
<p>The Cape family thought of many ways, but they were unable to remove the mask. They could only seek help from Zhang Siyou.</p>
<p>Zhang Siyou said, “My Mythical Ghost Suppression Talisman can only suppress it, but it can’t completely be eliminated. Furthermore, this mask is very strange. It’s useless to shatter it. I’m helpless as well. We must think of other solutions.”</p>
<p>This outcome was naturally within Zhou Wen’s expectations. The Ghoul Mask wasn’t the main point. No matter how strong one was, it was impossible to kill it. They had to dig up the grave and destroy the human-face symbol below.</p>
<p>The Zhang family looked at Moses, hoping that he could remove the mask. However, Moses shook his head and said, “If I had attacked from the beginning and completely destroyed the mask, I might have had a chance. Now, the mask is already on Charlie’s face. My Guardian is too powerful. Even if I can destroy the mask with one strike, Charlie won’t be spared.”</p>
<p>The Zhang family and the Cape family were in a dilemma. No one could solve the problem of the Fiend Tomb without harming Charlie.</p>
<p>When Zhang Chunqiu saw Zhou Wen standing by the side and watching all of this happen, his expression remained abnormally calm. With a thought, he asked Zhou Wen, “Zhou Wen, do you have a way to remove the mask without harming Charlie?”</p>
<p>As everyone fell silent, they looked at the two of them when they heard Zhang Chunqiu’s question.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen answered, “Sure, but I’ll say it again. I’m not as capable as Charlie and company. If you want me to resolve the problem, you have to dig open the Fiend Tomb.”</p>
<p>“Why are you still spouting nonsense at a time like this? The mask has already been lured out. Why are you still digging up the Fiend Tomb?” Uncle Zhang said.</p>
<p>As a conservative of the Zhang family, the last thing he wanted was to dig up the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was helpless as well. This was the result of unequal information. It was common sense from his point of view, but to the Zhang family, it was a mysterious and unfathomable unknown force. They were too afraid of the Fiend Tomb and were afraid that the Zhang family would be wiped out if the Fiend Tomb was dug up. Therefore, they were extremely against it.</p>
<p>“Uncle, Zhou Wen isn’t someone who speaks without reason. He must have his reasons for saying that.” Zhang Chunqiu and Dugu Ge had seen Zhou Wen’s strength from outside Forbidden City and knew that he was extraordinary.</p>
<p>Furthermore, back then, everyone believed that Zhou Wen and Old Master Xia had been trapped in Forbidden City. No one had seen him come out, but to their surprise, he had returned to Luoyang unscathed while Old Master Xia had vanished without a trace. Zhang Chunqiu knew that he himself couldn’t do such a thing.</p>
<p>“The truth is right in front of us. What reason do we need?” Uncle Zhang said coldly.</p>
<p>“Celestial Master, the Fiend Tomb’s influence on our Zhang family is getting more and more serious. If we can’t resolve it completely, I’m afraid our Zhang family will die in a few years, even if there are no disasters or calamities. Now that things have come to this, rather than being sitting ducks, why don’t we let Zhou Wen give it a try? I believe he can resolve the problem without alarming Ba. Celestial Master, please give him a chance and also give our Zhang family descendants a chance,” Zhang Chunqiu said as he bowed in front of Zhang Siyou.</p>
<p>“Chunqiu, what are you doing? Getting rid of that mask doesn’t require digging up the Fiend Tomb. We are only helpless because we are worried about Charlie’s life…” Uncle Zhang was immediately enraged.</p>
<p>“Now that things have come to this, I don’t think I can hold back anymore. Celestial Master, if you are willing to let my Guardian take action, I guarantee that I can destroy the mask. However, I can’t guarantee Charlie’s life,” Moses said.</p>
<p>“Moses… How dare you…” The Cape family members glared at him.</p>
<p>“Enough.” After Zhang Siyou spoke, everyone quietened down and looked at him. It was still Zhang Siyou who called the shots here.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, how confident are you?” Zhang Siyou looked at Zhang Chunqiu who was kneeling in front of him before asking Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I was only 70% confident previously, but now that I’ve seen the mask’s ability, I’m 90% confident,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Do you need anything?” Zhang Siyou asked again.</p>
<p>“No, one person is enough,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“Alright, then do it. If you succeed, the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg will be yours,” Zhang Siyou said with a nod.</p>
<p>“Celestial Master, we can’t dig up the Fiend Tomb…” Uncle Zhang said anxiously.</p>
<p>“Brother, I’ve already made my decision. There’s no need to speak further,” Zhang Siyou said calmly.</p>
<p>Uncle Zhang stomped his feet in anger. “Have you forgotten the teachings of the ancestral Celestial Master? Digging open the Fiend Tomb is a calamity for our Zhang family!”</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, what are you waiting for?” Zhang Chunqiu pretended not to hear his uncle’s indignant words as he stood up and nudged Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen no longer had any qualms as he summoned Tyrant Behemoth. With a boom, Tyrant Behemoth’s majestic body landed in front of the Fiend Tomb.</p>
<p>“Tyrant Behemoth… That’s actually Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast…” Apart from the Zhang family, the other families were alarmed.</p>
<p>After all, it was a powerful existence ranked fourth on the previous rankings. In fact, although Tyrant Behemoth was ranked fourth, it had never lost.</p>
<h3 id='chapter852'>Chapter 852: Expelling Evil</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Under Zhou Wen’s orders, Tyrant Behemoth activated Absolute Strength and slammed into the Fiend Tomb, digging it open.</p>
<p>“The Zhang family… is finished…” Uncle Zhang was shocked, angry, and afraid. His face was pale.</p>
<p>The other members of the Zhang family also wore looks of nervousness. After all, the teachings of the ancestral Celestial Master remained fresh in their minds. It would be a lie to say that they weren’t worried. Even Zhang Chunqiu’s palms were sweating.</p>
<p>However, the Fiend Tomb was slowly dug open by Tyrant Behemoth. Nothing strange happened.</p>
<p>“I thought that Tyrant Behemoth was a Companion Beast from the West District, but I never expected it to be in Zhou Wen’s hands.” The elder from the Ultimate Family Clan looked at Tyrant Behemoth with envy. Anyone would want to have such a violent battle pet, but there weren’t many violent battle pets of such level and quality in the entire Federation.</p>
<p>Moses had been watching coldly from the sidelines. Although Tyrant Behemoth was powerful, it wasn’t stronger than his Giant God Sovereign. The Giant God Sovereign was also a Strength-type. Furthermore, it had an extremely powerful restraining effect on Companion Beasts of the same type.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen wanted to rely on Tyrant Behemoth to fight him, Moses would definitely make him suffer.</p>
<p>As everyone had different thoughts, Tyrant Behemoth suddenly stopped digging and retreated a distance.</p>
<p>The Zhang family was puzzled as to why Tyrant Behemoth wasn’t digging. However, they suddenly saw Zhou Wen wave his hand as though something had flashed.</p>
<p>There was a cracking sound in the Fiend Tomb. Before they could see what was happening, black blood spewed out like a fountain, splattering everywhere.</p>
<p>At that moment, everyone could clearly see that there was an abstract human face symbol in the dug up Fiend Tomb. There was a sword mark on the human face symbol. It was unknown how it had been slashed, but it was spewing black blood.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>As the black blood spewed out, a hairline crack appeared on the mask on Charlie’s face. More and more cracks appeared. When the black blood spewed out, the mask shattered and turned to dust.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the mask on Charlie’s face. Even the fiend faces on the Fiend Stones shattered. The people who had been petrified gradually recovered.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they were already dead. Even with the Fiend Stone Petrification dispelled, it was impossible for them to be revived.</p>
<p>When the Zhang family saw this, they were overjoyed. Zhang Chunqiu secretly heaved a sigh of relief. He had also been gambling, but thankfully, he had won.</p>
<p>“Thankfully, I didn’t fail.” Zhou Wen didn’t continue digging because if he continued digging, he would have to use Truth Listener when he reached Ghost Hornless. This was something he didn’t wish to expose.</p>
<p>He could use Light Concealment in place of Invisibility Cloak to kill the Ghoul Mask, but Ghost Hornless needed Truth Listener’s help. The Invisibility Cloak was useless.</p>
<p>“My young friend, you saved our Zhang family from danger. I don’t know how to thank you. Come with me to retrieve the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg.” After Zhang Siyou said that, he said to Zhang Chunqiu, “Invite everyone back to have a rest. Don’t be negligent.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Zhang Chunqiu answered.</p>
<p>Zhang Siyou took Zhou Wen back to Celestial Master Manor. When they arrived, he waited for him to take his seat before saying, “My young friend, you still have something to say, right?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He never expected Zhang Siyou to see that he had something to say. Without any hesitation, he said, “I’ve already said before that apart from Ba, there are two dimensional creatures in the Fiend Tomb. Now, only one has been eliminated. There’s still one below. If we don’t eliminate it, I’m afraid the Zhang family’s problem won’t be completely resolved.”</p>
<p>“Young friend, you didn’t attack immediately. You must have some scruples?” Zhang Siyou said.</p>
<p>“It’s not difficult to eliminate that dimensional creature, but I need some special Companion Beasts. I don’t want too many people to see my Companion Beasts, so I hope that you can permit me to head to the Fiend Tomb alone. If you are worried, you can watch from the side. I just hope that there won’t be a third person present,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“It’s not a problem, and there’s no need for me to be present. I’ll get Chunqiu to accompany you later. Other than you and Chunqiu, no one else will know about this matter. Even I won’t ask too much.” Zhang Siyou paused before continuing, “However, there’s something I hope you can help the Zhang family keep secret.”</p>
<p>“Please speak, Celestial Master,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Since you can see through the Fiend patterns, it’s very likely that Ba is a Guardian. I hope no one else knows that Ba is a Guardian,” Zhang Siyou said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He never expected Zhang Siyou to request this, but he still agreed. “I can guarantee that this matter will never be spread from me.”</p>
<p>Zhang Siyou understood Zhou Wen’s underlying meaning and nodded. “That’s good. If the Zhang family were to spread the news, it would be the Zhang family’s life on the line.”</p>
<p>After Zhang Siyou called Zhang Chunqiu over, he got him to accompany Zhou Wen to the Fiend Tomb again.</p>
<p>After the two of them left, Uncle Zhang walked over. “Celestial Master, why did you do that? Since we’ve already decided to dig up the Fiend Tomb, why don’t we do it ourselves? Why did you hand our fate over to an outsider?”</p>
<p>Zhang Siyou poured him a cup of tea and slowly said, “Brother, why has our Zhang family been able to prosper for so many years? It’s not because our Companion Beasts are more powerful than others, nor is it because our Zhang family is powerful enough. It’s because we see further than others, think more than others, and take fewer detours than others.”</p>
<p>“In this era, resources might be important, but the importance of information and knowledge is sometimes even more important than resources. Just like Zhou Wen. He can see through the Fiend Tomb and discover the information inside. If we were to do it ourselves, although we might succeed, we might have to pay a huge price. There’s no need to do so.” Zhang Siyou paused before continuing, “Besides, don’t you think this outcome is better than expected for us to hand the Earth Elemental Beast to someone who isn’t from the six families?”</p>
<p>Uncle Zhang was taken aback before saying, “That’s true. However, Zhou Wen is really impressive. Even Old Master Xia was defeated by him. Now that he has the Earth Elemental Beast, I’m afraid…”</p>
<p>“Now that the Guardians have all appeared, it’s hard to predict what will happen in the future. However, do you still remember the last part of the ancestral Celestial Master’s last words?” Zhang Siyou said with a strange expression.</p>
<p>“You mean that we might have a chance…” Uncle Zhang didn’t dare continue as though there was some taboo.</p>
<p>“Let’s take it one step at a time. Our generation is already old, so we don’t have the chance to take another step forward. However, Chunqiu and the others are different. Perhaps they still have hope,” Zhang Siyou said indifferently.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Zhang Chunqiu arrived at the Fiend Tomb again. Zhang Chunqiu brought the Celestial Master Token and got the Zhang family guarding the area to temporarily retreat.</p>
<p>“I’ll leave this place to you. I’ll come back after the matter is done,” Zhang Chunqiu said as he left.</p>
<p>The Zhang family sure is straightforward. They actually didn’t leave a single person behind, Zhou Wen thought to himself. Such a decision wasn’t something anyone could make. After all, it concerned the life and death of the family. No one would be at ease leaving it in the hands of an outsider, but the Zhang family had chosen to do so.</p>
<h3 id='chapter853'>Chapter 853: Incubating Earth Elemental Beast</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen followed the steps and easily eliminated Ghost Hornless. When he dug up the Fiend Tomb, he was very careful, afraid that he would alarm the Goddess Ba.</p>
<p>Thankfully, nothing unexpected happened. After killing Ghost Hornless, Zhou Wen used the Fiend Stones to fill up the dug up Fiend Tomb before meeting up with Zhang Chunqiu.</p>
<p>As for Zhang Chunqiu, he had already prepared the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg. When they met, he gave it to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you afraid that I didn’t complete the mission?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“What’s there to be afraid of? You can run but you can’t hide. Could you not return to Luoyang for the rest of your life?” Zhang Chunqiu curled his lips and said.</p>
<p>“Thankfully, I’ve already completed the mission,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu thought for a moment and said, “You have to be careful of the other families, especially Moses. He won’t let it go easily.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded. “I know.”</p>
<p>“Let’s not talk about anything else. If there’s anything you need from my Zhang family, just say the word. If there’s anything you need, you can stay in Celestial Master Manor for a year or so,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a smile.</p>
<p>“That will be unnecessary. I still have some matters to attend to. After I’m done here, I plan on returning. Can you help me make arrangements to bid farewell to Yuzhi?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“She’s waiting for you at Celestial Master Manor.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“I never expected the Earth Elemental Beast to fall into Zhou Wen’s hands. Your Cape family has worked for nothing,” Moses said to Charlie with a smile.</p>
<p>“Didn’t your Family Clan of Gods end up empty-handed as well?” Charlie’s face was somewhat pale. Although he had escaped death, he had suffered some hidden injuries due to the Evil Ghost Mask’s control.</p>
<p>Moses smiled and said, “That might not be the case. He definitely needs external help to incubate a Mythical Companion Egg. I don’t think Zhou Wen can hatch the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg quickly. We still have a chance of getting it back.”</p>
<p>“You want to snatch the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg?” Charlie stared at Moses and asked.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen previously agreed to fight me. If I win the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg fair and square, how can this be called snatching?” Moses said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Hmph, then what do you mean by coming here to tell me this?” Charlie said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid that Zhou Wen won’t dare to accept the challenge and will run away at the last moment. Therefore, I wish to ask you to help me. If Zhou Wen wants to escape or doesn’t dare to accept the challenge, help me intercept him. With your Book of Prophecy, it will be difficult for him to escape even if he has wings,” said Moses.</p>
<p>“Why should I help you?” Charlie said coldly.</p>
<p>“No, no, no. You aren’t helping me, but helping yourself. Even if you can track him, are you confident of defeating Tyrant Behemoth? And I can defeat Tyrant Behemoth. If we work together, we can definitely snatch back the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg. When the time comes, our families will explore the Founding Emperor Tomb together and split the benefits equally. What do you think?” Moses said.</p>
<p>“Hmph, you make it sound nice. There’s only one Earth Elemental Beast. Without it, you can’t enter the Founding Emperor Tomb. How can we cooperate?” Charlie naturally didn’t believe Moses’s nonsense.</p>
<p>“To show my sincerity, after we retrieve the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg, your Cape family will be responsible for incubating it. This way, you should believe me, right?” Moses smiled.</p>
<p>“Do I have your word?” Charlie looked at Moses in disbelief.</p>
<p>Without the Earth Elemental Beast, one couldn’t enter the Founding Emperor Tomb. Previously, the six heroes had nearly fallen out because of this Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg. Now, Moses was willing to take the initiative to give it up. He found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>“Our families are from the West District. Although there are occasional conflicts, we are still family. The Founding Emperor Tomb is an important dimensional zone in the East District. If we cross districts like this, I’m afraid the Xia and Zhang families won’t sit back and do nothing. If our two families cooperate, we might be able to bring back everything inside. Otherwise, it’s very likely that we will get out the items and only serve to benefit the Zhang and Xia families. I’m not sure if the Xia family will participate, but the Zhang family took the initiative to give the Earth Elemental Beast away. Do you think they are really so kind as to give up the things in the Founding Emperor Tomb?” Moses asked.</p>
<p>After some thought, Charlie nodded and said, “What you said makes sense. We are also willing to cooperate, but the premise is that the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg must be incubated by our family.”</p>
<p>“Of course. I’ve already said that the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg is yours, but you have to split the spoils 50-50,” said Moses.</p>
<p>“Deal.” Charlie extended his palm.</p>
<p>While they were discussing how to snatch back the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg, Zhou Wen was already prepared to incubate it.</p>
<p>Typical Epic humans needed external help to hatch Mythical Companion Eggs if they wanted to incubate them. They needed plenty of preparation in the early stages, but Zhou Wen didn’t need it at all. He didn’t even need Slaughterer’s infinite Essence Energy. Dao Sutra, and First Order of Chaos could help him incubate Mythical Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Earth Elemental Beast: Mythical</p>
<p>Life Providence: Earth Life</p>
<p>Life Soul: Essence of Earth</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Earth of the Five Elements</p>
<p>Strength: 80</p>
<p>Speed: 80</p>
<p>Constitution: 80</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 80</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Earth Escape</p>
<p>Companion Form: Mount</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the Earth Elemental Beast is purely a mount-type Companion Beast. It doesn’t have any special offensive skills, but just the Earth Escape mount makes it excellent. After Zhou Wen saw its stats, he hatched it.</p>
<p>Soon, a Companion Beast that resembled a pangolin but was as large as a dinosaur appeared in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried it in-game and realized that the Earth Elemental Beast lived up to its name. Although it didn’t have any offensive skills, this Earth Escape skill could be activated repeatedly as long as one had Essence Energy. The cooldown time was very short.</p>
<p>With the Earth Elemental Beast’s Essence Energy maxed out, it could instantly carry out Earth Escape for more than fifty kilometers with Zhou Wen. It was truly a life-saving weapon.</p>
<p>It was also useful for assassination. In the midst of an army of ten thousand, an Earth Escape could allow him to appear in front of the enemy commander and kill him with one strike. Then, he could escape easily via Earth Escape. No matter how many enemies there were, they couldn’t stop the Earth Elemental Beast.</p>
<p>As long as I’m on the ground, I won’t have to be afraid of being besieged in the future. Zhou Wen was delighted, but on careful thought, there were also the four similar mounts of Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire. If he could obtain them all, he wondered if he could use the phone’s functions to fuse them into one.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was still studying how to use the Earth Elemental Beast, Moses sent someone to deliver a challenge letter. He wanted to have a fair duel with Zhou Wen to determine who was better.</p>
<p>After reading the invitation, Zhou Wen rejected it without any hesitation. Firstly, it was because he didn’t know what abilities Giant God Sovereign had. Secondly, he didn’t need to give Moses an excuse to openly snatch the Earth Elemental Beast.</p>
<p>If Moses wasn’t willing to give up on the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg, he could only secretly snatch it. When that happened, Zhou Wen would be taking the moral high ground. No matter what he did to Moses or what methods he used, no one could blame him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of being criticized, but there was no need for him to take the risk of fighting the unknown Giant God Sovereign. It would be too dangerous if the Giant God Sovereign was comparable to Ant City’s Guardian.</p>
<h3 id='chapter854'>Chapter 854: Pursuit?</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen packed his things and prepared to leave Mount Dragon Tiger.</p>
<p>He had previously rejected Moses, and now that he had packed his things and fled, it was very likely that Moses would chase after him and intercept him. When that happened, it would be Zhou Wen’s homeground.</p>
<p>Even if the Giant God Sovereign really had the strength of the Ant City Guardian, Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of employing guerrilla tactics.</p>
<p>Earth Escape, teleportation, invisibility, and with his excellent movement techniques, it could be said that Zhou Wen was best at guerrilla warfare.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen packed his things and was about to leave with Ya’er when he saw Zhang Chunqiu rush over.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, are you planning on leaving Mount Dragon Tiger?” Zhang Chunqiu asked directly.</p>
<p>“That’s right,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“It’s best you don’t leave now. We realized that Moses and Charlie have reached a tacit agreement. If you leave now, you definitely won’t be able to escape the pursuit of the two families. Charlie’s Book of Prophecy is best at finding people. You have already shown yourself in front of him. As long as you aren’t too far from him, he will be able to find you no matter where you hide,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. It’s perfect that way,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu was slightly taken aback, unsure what Zhou Wen meant. He stared at Zhou Wen with an odd expression and said, “Don’t tell me you want to attack Moses and company as well?”</p>
<p>“Why not?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“At least make a trip to Celestial Master Manor. We have already prepared the resources needed to incubate the Earth Elemental Beast. It can help you incubate the Earth Elemental Beast in three days. When the time comes, you will be much safer,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, will Moses still chase after me?” Zhou Wen paused and said, “Besides, I’ve already hatched the Earth Elemental Beast.”</p>
<p>With that said, Zhou Wen summoned the Earth Elemental Beast.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu was dumbfounded. When he snapped to his senses, he said with a bitter smile, “It looks like Moses and the rest are destined to not be able to gain an advantage.”</p>
<p>“Who can they blame for their greed?” Zhou Wen put away the Earth Elemental Beast and bade Zhang Chunqiu farewell before secretly leaving Mount Dragon Tiger with Ya’er.</p>
<p>Looking at Zhou Wen’s departing back, Zhang Chunqiu muttered to himself, “This Zhou Wen is even more terrifying than An Tianzuo was. I’m afraid he will really turn the Federation upside down. In this era, I wonder if it’s a blessing or a curse.”</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>The news of Zhou Wen secretly leaving Mount Dragon Tiger naturally couldn’t be hidden from Moses and Charlie.</p>
<p>Charlie had already predicted Zhou Wen’s departure as he said with a sneer, “It hasn’t even been twenty-four hours since he obtained the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg. He definitely won’t be able to hatch it in time. As long as we catch up to him, we will have a chance of getting the Companion Egg back.”</p>
<p>“Then what are we waiting for? Before he returns to Luoyang, we have to stop him and snatch the Companion Egg from him,” said Moses.</p>
<p>“Not only do I want the Companion Egg, but I also want his life.” A cold glint flashed in Charlie’s eyes. The grudge between Zhou Wen and the Cape family naturally wouldn’t be resolved with Zhou Wen’s shattering of the Ghoul Mask on his face. He wouldn’t consider how Zhou Wen had saved his life.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>With the two families mobilizing their forces together, the originally lively Dragon Tiger Town suddenly became much quieter.</p>
<p>“Celestial Master, Zhou Wen has already left Dragon Tiger Town. Moses and Charlie have also led their men to chase after him.” An intelligence officer from the Zhang family reported to Zhang Siyou.</p>
<p>“Should we send someone over and wait for an opportunity to snatch the Earth Elemental Beast back? If we can snatch it back this time, we can prevent others from knowing that the Earth Elemental Beast is in our Zhang family.” Uncle Zhang’s eyes lit up. Zhang Chunqiu hadn’t returned to report that Zhou Wen had already hatched the Earth Elemental Beast, so he wasn’t aware.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. Moses and company aren’t Zhou Wen’s match,” Zhang Siyou said indifferently.</p>
<p>“That might not be the case, right? After all, Moses has a Guardian. His strength can’t be underestimated. With Charlie’s Book of Prophecy, Zhou Wen probably won’t be able to escape that easily.” Uncle Zhang didn’t think so.</p>
<p>Zhang Siyou said, “So what if he has a Guardian? What kind of person is Old Master Xia? Even he wasn’t able to kill Zhou Wen, much less a mere Moses who relies on a Guardian. They will probably be doomed if they attack him.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Although the eldest uncle of the Zhang family didn’t quite believe Zhang Siyou’s judgment, he couldn’t refute it. After all, Zhang Siyou’s knowledge and judgment far exceeded his. Otherwise, he would have taken over as Celestial Master instead of Zhang Siyou who was the second eldest in the family.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ran all the way. He didn’t really want to escape, but to create the illusion that he was escaping.</p>
<p>Moses and company kept chasing after Zhou Wen. With Charlie’s Book of Prophecy tracking Zhou Wen’s location, they got closer and closer.</p>
<p>“That bastard Zhou Wen is actually running so fast. We have to speed up,” Charlie said through gritted teeth. They had chased for hundreds of kilometers, but they still hadn’t caught up to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“It’s just a trapped beast’s struggle. He can’t escape…” Just as Moses spoke, a person on his left suddenly touched a tree. The tree exploded and sent the person flying. Several people nearby were affected.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Moses quickly checked the man’s injuries and saw that he was nearly half-dead.</p>
<p>“It’s a Life Blast-type Essence Energy Skill. It must have been left behind by that bastard, Zhou Wen,” said Charlie as he observed the destroyed tree.</p>
<p>“Damn it, Bayh. Stay and take care of them. The rest of you, follow me. I want that bastard dead,” Moses said angrily.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Everyone chased, but this time, they were much more careful. They didn’t touch the trees or grass.</p>
<p>After chasing for a distance, they arrived at a grassland. Just as they approached, they alarmed a group of insects in the grassland. Large swaths of them flew up.</p>
<p>“No good! Be careful of those insects!” Charlie shouted, but it was already too late. Someone had already waved their hands at the insects, hoping to drive them to the side.</p>
<p>However, when their powers hit the insects, it immediately triggered a series of explosions.</p>
<p>Due to the low life force of the worms, a large number of them exploded together, leaving them in a sorry state. Some people who weren’t paying attention had their eyes injured from the explosion, while others were covered in blood.</p>
<p>In their panic, they stepped on the grass. The grass also exploded, immediately causing a series of explosions.</p>
<p>“That bastard!” Moses saw that many people were injured. Although their injuries were not very serious, they looked pathetic.</p>
<p>When they continued chasing after Zhou Wen, they realized that the forest had turned into a huge minefield. Anything they touched could turn into a mine. This made them suspicious. Not only were many people injured, but their progress was also much slower.</p>
<p>“If this continues, that bastard will escape. Someone with a flying pet, chase after him with me. The others will circle around and take the main road and see if they can intercept him.” After Moses and Charlie discussed the plan, the two of them continued chasing with flying pets.</p>
<h3 id='chapter855'>Chapter 855: Giant God Sovereign</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>They no longer needed to fear skills like Life Blast in midair. Moses and company sped up and chased after Zhou Wen crazily, but when Charlie predicted Zhou Wen’s location again, he realized that Zhou Wen was behind them.</p>
<p>“No good!” Charlie and Moses’s expressions changed drastically. This was because Zhou Wen’s current location was where they had separated from the others.</p>
<p>“Let’s go back quickly.” After Moses led his men back, they discovered the corpses of their companions not far from where they had parted. They had been blasted into pieces, and there were almost no complete corpses.</p>
<p>The surrounding forest was also in a mess. Clearly, a powerful explosion had happened. It wasn’t an ordinary Life Blast. The typical self-destruction of trees didn’t have such power.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, I’ll tear you to pieces.” Moses’s expression was livid as he urged Charlie to continue tracking Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>This time, Moses directly summoned Giant God Sovereign. After he fused with Giant God Sovereign, the armor transformed by Giant God Sovereign still remained huge. Moses was inside Giant God Sovereign’s body as the core existence inside Giant God Sovereign armor.</p>
<p>Moses, who was like a giant, grabbed Charlie and charged forward without caring if there were any Life Blast mechanisms nearby.</p>
<p>Indeed, large swaths of trees and grass exploded, but it was useless against the huge armor that Giant God Sovereign had transformed into. It was unable to injure it at all.</p>
<p>When Moses ran to the nearby water, tadpole-like things suddenly rushed out of the water. The tadpoles constantly exploded.</p>
<p>However, such power failed to injure Moses. All of Giant God Sovereign’s armor blocked the explosions.</p>
<p>“These things killed them.” Moses could tell from the tadpoles’ explosive mode that these were the things that killed their companions.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, your tricks are useless in front of absolute strength. Come out and die,” Moses said coldly.</p>
<p>Charlie had already predicted that Zhou Wen was less than five kilometers away and could definitely hear him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already seen everything clearly with Truth Listener. He thought to himself, From the looks of it, Giant God Sovereign should be a Strength- and Defense-type Guardian. Tyrant Behemoth is also of the same type. It shouldn’t be weaker than Giant God Sovereign. However, Moses knows that Tyrant Behemoth is in my hands, yet he’s still so confident. He probably has a way to restrain Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s figure flashed as he continued pulling away from Moses and company. However, after Moses donned the Giant God Sovereign armor, his speed was too fast. Not only was Zhou Wen unable to pull away, but the gap between them kept shrinking.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t mind. As he fled, he summoned a large number of Musical Note Sprites and Golden Harp. There were now tens of thousands of Musical Note Sprites. Together with the power of the Golden Harp, the sound waves produced were enough to kill an Epic expert.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it was very difficult for sound wave attacks to be completely blocked by armor. No matter how strong the defense of the Giant God Sovereign armor was, it could be penetrated by the sound waves and killed.</p>
<p>Moses chased after him with Charlie in a frenzy. Suddenly, he saw a large number of Musical Note Sprites and a Golden Harp. Before he could react, the Golden Harp suddenly sounded.</p>
<p>Hum!</p>
<p>With the sound of the Golden Harp, all the Musical Note Sprites sounded. The sound waves emitted were like a tidal wave that surged towards Moses.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>The sound wave failed to break through the armor of Giant God Sovereign, but Charlie, who was held in Moses’ hand, was bleeding from his seven orifices because of the sound wave. His Book of Prophecy and the crucifix could not defend against the sound blast.</p>
<p>Moses was alarmed. A golden barrier lit up over the Giant God Sovereign armor, protecting Charlie inside and thus, saving him.</p>
<p>The sound blast was unable to penetrate the barrier and was blocked outside. Just as Moses was about to destroy the Musical Note Sprites and harp, he realized that the Musical Note Sprites and harp had disappeared.</p>
<p>Moses rushed over at full speed, but he didn’t find Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Where did Zhou Wen escape to?” Moses asked Charlie. Charlie wiped the blood from his face and used the Book of Prophecy to predict Zhou Wen’s location again.</p>
<p>“Impossible… He’s here…” When Charlie saw the prediction, his eyes widened in disbelief.</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhou Wen’s figure appeared above Moses out of thin air. He held a golden broadsword in his hand and slashed at the golden barrier with an indomitable golden sword beam.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>A three-foot gap was slashed open in the golden barrier, but Zhou Wen’s sword couldn’t continue. The barrier wasn’t as simple as a shell. It also seemed corporeal. If not for the Golden Overlord Sword having the augmentation of Ever-Victorious and Unstoppable, it would have been impossible for it to slice open the barrier.</p>
<p>“You’ve finally appeared!” Moses wasn’t alarmed but delighted. He controlled the Giant God Sovereign armor and threw a punch at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s figure flashed in midair before suddenly disappearing.</p>
<p>Moses originally imagined that Zhou Wen was fast and had moved elsewhere, but when he looked around, he didn’t see Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Damn it, why are his skills so wretched? Where did he go? Quickly find him,” Moses gritted his teeth and said to Charlie.</p>
<p>Charlie used the Book of Prophecy to predict again, but he realized that Zhou Wen was already several kilometers away. He pointed in surprise and anger and said, “He’s over there. Don’t let him escape.”</p>
<p>With the virtually invincible ability of the Giant God Sovereign armor, Moses did not care if there was an ambush. He charged forward crazily. The tall trees were knocked away by the Giant God Sovereign armor like a huge humanoid machine.</p>
<p>Its defense is comparable to Tyrant Behemoth with Absolute Strength activated, but its strength is much weaker. However, in that case, it shouldn’t be able to defeat Tyrant Behemoth. What kind of power does Giant God Sovereign have that makes Moses so confident? Zhou Wen thought of various possibilities.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I can only let Tyrant Behemoth give it a try. When Zhou Wen saw Moses chasing after him, he summoned Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Not daring to be careless, Zhou Wen got Tyrant Behemoth to activate Absolute Strength before charging at Moses.</p>
<p>“Good timing.” Moses finally had a combat target. His speed didn’t decrease but rose as he charged at Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth also gathered all its strength and threw a punch at Moses, who was wearing the Giant God Sovereign armor.</p>
<p>A ruthless glint flashed in Moses’s eyes. He didn’t swing his fist to meet it. Instead, he used the golden barrier of the Giant God Sovereign armor to slam into Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth’s fist struck the golden barrier, but it failed to send Moses retreating. Instead, it was sent flying as its fist bones shattered.</p>
<p>A repulsion barrier! With his experience, Zhou Wen immediately saw through the trick. Tyrant Behemoth wasn’t sent retreating by Giant God Sovereign, but was defeated by its own strength and the power of Giant God Sovereign.</p>
<h3 id='chapter856'>Chapter 856: I Just Want to Set Off Fireworks</h3>
<p>“Die! My Giant God Sovereign is invincible.” Moses controlled the Giant God Sovereign armor and threw a punch at Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as Tyrant Behemoth returned to him. Since he knew that Moses’s Guardian was good at reflecting strength, a Strength-type Companion Beast like Tyrant Behemoth wasn’t suitable for battle.</p>
<p>“Without Tyrant Behemoth, how are you going to fight me? Zhou Wen, come out and die. I’ll leave your corpse intact.” Moses chased after Zhou Wen while using words to agitate him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t moved at all. As he rapidly moved, he also thought of a way to kill Giant God Sovereign.</p>
<p>Giant God Sovereign’s defense wasn’t weaker than Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength. It also had the ability to reflect strength. It was difficult to break through Giant God Sovereign armor’s defense.</p>
<p>It was not difficult to kill Moses, but killing him was useless. As an equal in the contract, Giant God Sovereign could escape and choose another person to contract.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s main target was Giant God Sovereign, not Moses.</p>
<p>The only thing worth rejoicing about is that this Giant God Sovereign shouldn’t have the ability to undergo Terror transformation. There’s still a chance of killing him, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>If it were an ordinary Guardian, Zhou Wen would have killed it long ago if he sneaked an attack with Invisibility Cloak. However, Giant God Sovereign’s defense was just too powerful. This wasn’t a problem that could be resolved with a sneak attack.</p>
<p>Moses was getting closer and closer to Zhou Wen. Just as he was about to catch up to him, his eyes burned with killing intent. “Zhou Wen, you can’t escape.”</p>
<p>“Don’t waste your breath on him. Kill him and snatch back the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg,” Charlie shouted with red eyes. With so many people dead, they finally had a chance to kill Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>As long as they could kill Zhou Wen and retrieve the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg, everything would be worth it.</p>
<p>Just as they were about to catch up to Zhou Wen, they suddenly saw Zhou Wen summon a Companion Beast. It looked like a huge pangolin as Zhou Wen rode on its back.</p>
<p>They only knew of the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg, but they didn’t know what it looked like.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen summon such a Companion Beast, they imagined that Zhou Wen wanted to risk his life. Without any hesitation, Moses threw a punch. Even Tyrant Behemoth couldn’t fight Giant God Sovereign head-on, much less such an inconspicuous Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Moses punched down, blasting a huge crater in the ground, but Zhou Wen and the Companion Beast were nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Could it be! Moses and Charlie had a bad feeling.</p>
<p>Turning their heads, they realized that Zhou Wen was already dozens of meters away. Moses threw another punch. This time, he saw it clearly. The pangolin that Zhou Wen was sitting on burrowed into the ground and vanished. When they emerged again, they were already a hundred meters away.</p>
<p>“Earth Elemental Beast… He actually hatched Earth Elemental Beast… How is this possible…” Charlie shouted indignantly.</p>
<p>No matter how strong Giant God Sovereign was, it was useless if he couldn’t catch up to the Earth Elemental Beast. It was already impossible for him to kill Zhou Wen today, much less snatch the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg. Even if they killed Zhou Wen, the Companion Beast that had already hatched would vanish with its master.</p>
<p>Moses was stunned. He did not expect such an outcome.</p>
<p>“Count yourself lucky.” Seeing that the situation was hopeless, Moses wanted to retreat.</p>
<p>“Who said you can leave?” Zhou Wen rode on the Earth Beast’s back and blocked Moses’s path.</p>
<p>“If you didn’t have the Earth Elemental Beast to escape, you would have long been killed by me. How dare you say such things in front of me?” Moses said coldly as he walked towards Zhou Wen, hoping to stomp him and the Earth Elemental Beast to death.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen remained unmoved as he summoned Tyrant Behemoth. At the same time, he fed the Rejuvenation Pill he had recently obtained to Tyrant Behemoth, allowing its injured fist to rapidly heal.</p>
<p>“What’s the point of summoning a defeated opponent? No matter how many times you summon it, it will be suicide,” said Moses.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as he continued the summoning. Truth Listener was summoned and it shattered two earrings. It descended like a ferocious beast and glared at Moses.</p>
<p>“Another Strength-type Companion Beast? It doesn’t matter. Attack together.” Moses didn’t care.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued summoning and summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull and Torch Dragon. One bull and one dragon surrounded Moses.</p>
<p>“That’s… Torch Dragon… That’s Torch Dragon from the Zhuolu temple…” Charlie recognized Torch Dragon and his expression changed drastically.</p>
<p>Moses didn’t look too good either. Zhou Wen had actually summoned five Mythical Companion Beasts alone. This was very rare among the six families.</p>
<p>“No matter how many Companion Beasts you summon, it makes no difference for Giant God Sovereign. If you don’t break through my defense, you will ultimately be defeated.” Although Moses said that, he was no longer confident.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored him and continued summoning his Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>The Golden Overlord Sword and Golden Battle God Halberd appeared beside him, floating in the air. At the same time, the Mythical Kun Dragon and Zhen Dragon appeared. The two black dragons also joined the battlefield as Moses was surrounded in the center.</p>
<p>“That’s… the Golden Battle God Temple of the Metalwork Temple, the black dragon in the Zhuolu underground sea… How is that possible… How can he have so many Mythical Companion Beasts…” Charlie’s voice was trembling. He had never seen a person have so many Mythical Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Even in recent years, the six families had many more Mythical Companion Beasts than before, but it was already not bad for the core upper echelons to have one. Only top figures could have two or three Mythical Companion Beasts. Those who had five or six Mythical Companion Beasts were considered the family’s top combat strength, the true pillar of the family.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen had summoned more than ten Mythical Companion Beasts alone. Furthermore, they included top-notch terrifying existences like Tyrant Behemoth and Torch Dragon. How could Charlie not be alarmed?</p>
<p>At that moment, Moses’s mind was filled with curses. He never expected that Zhou Wen, who wasn’t even a direct descendant of the An family, would have so many Mythical pets on him. Mythical Companion Beasts were summoned out as though they were nothing.</p>
<p>Moses was already regretting it. Although Giant God Sovereign’s strength was powerful and his defense was almost invincible, who could guarantee that none of Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts could restrain him?</p>
<p>According to what Moses knew, Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World’s power could devour all living beings. Giant God Sovereign might not be able to withstand it.</p>
<p>“It’s useless. No matter how many Companion Beasts you have, it’s ultimately a joke if you can’t break through Giant God Sovereign’s defense.” Moses’ tone was no longer as confident as before.</p>
<p>“Is that so?” Zhou Wen finally spoke. At the same time, he summoned two Companion Beasts. Charlie and Moses didn’t recognize the two Companion Beasts, but from the looks of them, they were undoubtedly at the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had summoned Doctor Darkness and Explosive Fiend Man.</p>
<p>“Of course. If you can break through Giant God Sovereign’s defense, why did you need to summon so many Mythical Companion Beasts?” Moses seemed to be speaking to Zhou Wen and himself.</p>
<p>“You will soon know the use of having so many Mythical Companion Beasts.” Zhou Wen waved his hand as the terrifying Mythical Companion Beast army charged at Giant God Sovereign.</p>
<p>When Moses saw so many terrifying Mythical Companion Beasts rush over, he felt his scalp tingle, but he had no choice but to bite the bullet and accept the challenge.</p>
<p>However, how could a single Giant God Sovereign deal with so many Mythical Companion Beasts? Although Tyrant Behemoth and company couldn’t break through Giant God Sovereign’s defense, it didn’t stop them from rushing forward to hold down the armored Moses.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth and Truth Listener each held onto an arm, while the two black dragons each pulled at a leg. Torch Dragon wrapped around its neck and pulled Giant God Sovereign down.</p>
<p>Giant God Sovereign had powerful defense, but in terms of strength, it was inferior to Tyrant Behemoth, much less be able to resist so many Mythical creatures at the same time.</p>
<p>The Great Might Vajra Bull stomped on his chest as the Golden Overlord Sword and Golden Battle God Halberd stabbed at his body. Although they failed to penetrate the barrier, they pressed him firmly to the ground. No matter how he struggled, he couldn’t escape.</p>
<p>Charlie fell to the ground. Moses couldn’t be bothered with him anymore. He stood up and wanted to run, but he saw a scalpel suddenly appear and slice across his throat. Doctor Darkness gracefully walked past him and returned to Zhou Wen’s side without looking back.</p>
<p>Charlie covered his neck in horror, but blood kept gushing out of the gaps between his fingers. His eyes widened as he opened his mouth to say something, but all he spat out was blood.</p>
<p>Plop!</p>
<p>Charlie’s body fell to the ground; he was dead.</p>
<p>“What a pity,” Zhou Wen said indifferently when he saw that the Dead Man Tree didn’t react.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, it’s useless no matter how many Mythical Companion Beasts you have. You can’t break through my defense. You can’t injure me.” Moses was pressed to the ground by so many Mythical Companion Beasts, but he wasn’t injured. Although he couldn’t move, he still roared.</p>
<p>“Why should I break your defense?” As Zhou Wen spoke, Explosive Fiend Man walked over.</p>
<p>Explosive Fiend Man, whose eye mask was shimmering with an evil glow, pressed its palm on Giant God Sovereign’s barrier, leaving strange marks on it that gradually covered every corner of the barrier.</p>
<p>The Time Bomb skill could only be used on objects that could not resist. It was basically impossible to use it on a Guardian like Giant God Sovereign. However, Giant God Sovereign couldn’t even move.</p>
<p>“What are you trying to do?” Moses’s face was pale, and his eyes were filled with fear. Although he did not know what those imprints did, he knew that things weren’t looking good.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. I’m just in a good mood and want to set off fireworks to celebrate,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Let go of me… You bastard…” Moses struggled with all his might. He already felt that something was amiss. Even Giant God Sovereign was struggling to escape as though he was terrified.</p>
<p>However, it was useless. Under the suppression of so many terrifying Mythical creatures, even the Guardian—Giant God Sovereign—couldn’t escape.</p>
<p>After all, it had only broken out of its cocoon not long ago. Although it was strong, it wasn’t capable of Terror transformation and didn’t have overwhelming strength.</p>
<p>More and more imprints appeared on the golden barrier, emitting a dangerous purple glow. It was like a spiderweb that covered the entire barrier.</p>
<p>Finally, Zhou Wen unsummoned all his Companion Beasts and quickly retreated.</p>
<p>“No…” Moses finally regained his freedom. His first reaction was to remove the armor, but it was too late.</p>
<p>Explosive Fiend Man snapped his fingers and there was a bang.</p>
<p>Like a hydrogen bomb exploding, a golden sun rapidly expanded its radius with Moses at the center. Everything that was devoured instantly turned to ashes.</p>
<h3 id='chapter857'>Chapter 857: Perfect Slaughterer</h3>
<p>Due to the Explosive Fiend Man detonating Giant God Sovereign’s strongest barrier, the powerful force made it so that Moses didn’t even have the chance to scream. He was directly reduced to ashes, and Giant God Sovereign himself was blasted apart.</p>
<p>With the death of Giant God Sovereign, Zhou Wen felt a strange force enter his body, causing Slaughterer to evolve again.</p>
<p>I’m finally about to evolve a Perfect Body! Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief. He had killed several Guardians. If he didn’t evolve, he didn’t know where he could find Guardians to kill.</p>
<p>The Slaughterer that enveloped Zhou Wen’s body had always been an invisible existence. After advancing to an Evolved Body, Zhou Wen could sense its existence and take the initiative to control it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen still didn’t understand it much. It was limited to powering Immortal Slaying.</p>
<p>This evolution allowed Slaughterer’s form to gradually appear. Although it was only a blurry shadow, like a silhouette, it was many times stronger than back when it was invisible and untouchable.</p>
<p>As he watched the light gradually appear, Zhou Wen realized that the light was somewhat familiar, as though he had seen it before.</p>
<p>He couldn’t see the facial features or figure, but the aura was very familiar.</p>
<p>Is it the woman in my hallucination? Zhou Wen suddenly recalled where he had seen such an aura. The woman who had defied the heavens to slay immortals and made all races bow down to her seemed to have such an aura.</p>
<p>When the evolution was completed, Zhou Wen could only see a silhouette-like shadow. The Slaughterer’s appearance hadn’t completely surfaced, nor had it been able to condense a corporeal body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at the information in-game and realized that Slaughterer had indeed advanced to a Perfect Body. However, its name and introduction remained the same.</p>
<p>The only thing that made Zhou Wen feel that Slaughterer had indeed grown was that he could finally maintain contact with Slaughterer. He still needed to slowly experiment with its other abilities.</p>
<p>Is that it? Is this the final appearance of the Slaughterer Life Soul? Zhou Wen looked at the figure of light and found it unbelievable that Slaughterer ultimately looked like this. It was too abstract.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to believe it, the truth was that Perfect Body was the final form of a Life Soul. It was impossible to change it.</p>
<p>After cleaning up the battlefield, Zhou Wen rode the Earth Elemental Beast again with Ya’er. This time, he wasn’t in a rush. However, his speed wasn’t slow. Furthermore, the path he was taking wasn’t the way back to Luoyang.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t plan on returning to Luoyang right away. He wanted to circle around and walk through the relatively safe human districts to advance Fine Dust.</p>
<p>After walking for less than two days, Fine Dust began to evolve. The dust-like planet began to burn like a tiny sun, emitting a strange glow.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t know if it was of any use, the stat augmentation provided by the Fine Dust was much stronger than before.</p>
<p>Glimmer: Evolved Body</p>
<p>The evolution of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art is indeed easy. If I take more steps, it shouldn’t be difficult for me to reach the Perfect Body. Instead, Civilized Country needs a large number of spatial teleportations to evolve. What should I do? Zhou Wen couldn’t think of a good solution.</p>
<p>The Zhang family’s Mystic Bird could rapidly teleport, but the Zhang family had already hatched it. It was impossible for them to transfer it to Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen didn’t have enough benefits to move them.</p>
<p>I’ll take it one step at a time. Zhou Wen didn’t idle along the way. He was studying the Demon God Catalog, hoping to figure out what kind of Essence Energy Art it was and how to condense a Life Providence and Life Soul.</p>
<p>Condensing a Life Providence wasn’t difficult. With the Essence Energy Art and his talent, as long as he had sufficient perceptivity, success wasn’t a distant thing.</p>
<p>However, a Life Soul needed a foundation. Typically, a Guardian’s drop of blood was needed as a foundation. However, the Guardian’s attribute had to be compatible with the Demon God Catalog.</p>
<p>I wonder if The Thearch’s blood can be used as a foundation of the Demon God Catalog. Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Up to now, Zhou Wen still couldn’t figure out what kind of existence The Thearch was. He didn’t know if she was a dimensional creature or a Guardian, or if she was neither.</p>
<p>However, The Thearch was trapped in Chess Mountain, and the Demon God Catalog was obtained from there. The possibility of the two being compatible was naturally higher.</p>
<p>It probably won’t be that easy to obtain a drop of blood essence from The Thearch, but it’s not like there’s no chance. Compared to the Guardians who I have to fight to obtain their blood, it’s possible to negotiate with The Thearch. However, I don’t know what price I will have to pay. Zhou Wen didn’t think too much about it. He wanted to condense the Demon God Catalog’s Life Providence first.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only did his research when he walked. He didn’t do any training because switching to other Essence Energy Arts prevented Glimmer from obtaining energy.</p>
<p>When he stopped to gather information, he exacted his thoughts and insights on the Demon God Catalog. In just a few days, he had obtained a huge improvement and condensed a Life Providence.</p>
<p>Life Providence: Demon Bloodline</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that when he used the Demon Bloodline, his basic stats were greatly augmented. Among all his Life Providences, the Demon Bloodline augmented his physical stats the most.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, this Demon God Catalog is likely an Essence Energy Art that corresponds to one’s Constitution. The other Essence Energy Art corresponding to Constitution is Small Perfection of Wisdom. The Supreme Hell King Life Soul is already a Perfect Body. Then, if I advance the Demon God Catalog’s Life Soul to a Perfect Body, won’t my Constitution reach 41 points?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was vexed about how he could obtain a Guardian’s blood that corresponded to the Demon God Catalog and condense a Life Soul.</p>
<p>“The Thearch, are you interested in making a deal?” Zhou Wen planned on probing The Thearch’s intentions. If he could obtain a drop of her blood, he could give it a try.</p>
<p>“How rare. You actually took the initiative to make a trade with me. Weren’t you deathly afraid of me and kept hiding from me?” The Thearch replied in a teasing tone.</p>
<p>“I’m not avoiding you. I’m just too busy and don’t have time. Otherwise, I would have come to Chess Mountain to visit you,” Zhou Wen said in a hypocritical manner.</p>
<p>“Alright, then come. I’ll wait for you,” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>“I’m near the South District now. I really can’t return. When I return, I’ll definitely visit you.” Zhou Wen sent another message. “Are you interested in the deal I’m talking about?”</p>
<p>“What do you want?” The Thearch asked straightforwardly.</p>
<p>“I want a drop of your blood essence.” Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and sent the message. He was somewhat nervous, unsure if The Thearch would end up falling out with him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter858'>Chapter 858: Qiongqi</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Sure.” The Thearch’s message delighted Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What do you want? I’ll exchange it with you,” Zhou Wen hurriedly said.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you want to see me? Then come. If you come to see me, I’ll give you a drop of blood essence. I don’t want anything else,” The Thearch replied.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately depressed. He had only said it in passing. He really didn’t dare go to Chess Mountain to see The Thearch.</p>
<p>“I really can’t come back now. Do you want to exchange for something else? There are many new and interesting things here. Shall I send some to you? Otherwise, I’ll buy any experimental equipment or apparatus you want,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I don’t want anything. If you come, there will be blood essence. If you don’t, nothing.” The Thearch’s reply left Zhou Wen somewhat helpless.</p>
<p>“Let’s talk when I get back. I can’t fly back now.” Zhou Wen replied before switching off his phone.</p>
<p>Typically, when Guardians are in the cocoon, their bodies will be flowing with blood essence. When they come out of the cocoon, the blood essence will have already fused into their bodies. It won’t be that easy to obtain more blood essence. Perhaps The Thearch’s blood essence isn’t useful. After some thought, Zhou Wen felt that it was best not to head to Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>Since it’s the Demon God Catalog, the nine black dragons are demon dragons. The Guardian they are guarding might be compatible with the Demon God Catalog. Zhou Wen launched the game and ran to the underground sea to obtain a drop of the Guardian’s blood. However, it was useless. The Demon God Catalog didn’t absorb it.</p>
<p>He went to Ant City to give it a try, but the outcome was the same. The blood essence of the two Guardians was useless for the Demon God Catalog. However, this also meant that the Demon God Catalog wasn’t an Essence Energy stat.</p>
<p>This path doesn’t seem to work. Zhou Wen had to think of other solutions to see if he could find other Guardians that hadn’t broken out of their cocoons.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>This was because most of his Life Soul and Essence Energy Art had reached a bottleneck. Zhou Wen could only game and grind dungeons on the way. This time, he had cleared all the Vermilion Bird’s Seven Mansions while grinding in the Endless Sea of Stars.</p>
<p>The seven Essence Energy Skills were the same as the Seven Mansions of the East. They combined into one Essence Energy Skill. When used, a Vermillion Bird’s shadow surrounded him. Just like the Seven Mansions of the East, they were all Essence Energy barrier-type skills. The level of the Essence Energy Skill didn’t increase.</p>
<p>Could it be that I really have to gather all the 28 Lunar Mansion skills to reveal their true might? Zhou Wen had no choice but to continue grinding.</p>
<p>The Northern Black Tortoise’s Seven Mansions and the Western White Tiger’s Seven Mansions each lacked a skill. They were especially difficult to grind. Zhou Wen had no idea how many times he had tried only to fail.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen deliberately grinded a few more times. In a stroke of luck, he managed to gather all the seven Essence Energy Skills of the Western White Tiger’s Seven Mansions.</p>
<p>The Essence Energy Skill that combined the seven skills was the same as Azure Dragon and Vermillion Bird. They were all protective Essence Energy Skills but its level didn’t increase.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen went all out as he farmed the Endless Sea of Stars again and again. He had to grind out the last skill to see what would happen after he gathered all the 28 Lunar Mansion skills.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen grinded for nearly ten days and dripped his blood to revive countless times but the last Mansion’s skill never appeared.</p>
<p>Thankfully, during this period, Zhou Wen obtained another Demon Blood True Dragon Companion Egg. Its stats were almost identical to the first two, but this one was a Qian Dragon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen already had Qian, Kun, and Zhen of the nine Demon Blood True Dragons, but the three black dragons failed to fuse. No matter how he matched them, it would indicate that they lacked a main body.</p>
<p>What’s this main body? Could it be that the Demon Blood True Dragon with the Wu dragon pearl is the main body of the nine black dragons? Zhou Wen guessed.</p>
<p>However, if he couldn’t obtain a Wu True Dragon Companion Egg, his guessing was pointless.</p>
<p>Every time Zhou Wen respawned, he would grind the baby tiger, but after grinding for so long, no Companion Egg dropped. It was the same for some Mythical creatures. It was very difficult for the Companion Eggs to drop.</p>
<p>Even if Qiongqi is like Torch Dragon, a Companion Beast with only one attribute, Qiongqi should have produced one after farming it so many times, right? Or could it be that my way of grinding for it is wrong? Just like Medusa, Qiongqi needs a special method to have a Companion Egg drop?</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen thought of a possibility. Don’t tell me it only drops a Companion Egg when someone with a ferocious Life Providence kills Qiongqi?</p>
<p>With this possibility in mind, Zhou Wen planned on giving it a try.</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s Life Providence was extremely ferocious, but it was still at the Epic stage. It was definitely unrealistic for it to kill Qiongqi.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen had enough Mythical Companion Beasts. He summoned the Mythical pet team and had them charge into the Qiongqi temple. They ganked Qiongqi and beat it to a pulp.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General then charged over and stabbed again and again. After striking for more than half an hour, it managed to kill Qiongqi.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>‘Killed Mythical creature, Qiongqi. Discovered Companion Egg.’</p>
<p>This really works? Zhou Wen’s mouth gaped open for a long time.</p>
<p>It was just a flash of brilliance that he gave a try. Who knew that it would really work?</p>
<p>If I had known this would happen, I would have had Qiongqi dropped a long time ago. Why would I have to wait so long? Zhou Wen could only sigh. Sometimes, brute force was really unacceptable. Intelligence was most important.</p>
<p>Qiongqi: Mythical (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Punishing Kindness and Raising Evil</p>
<p>Life Soul: Companion with Evil</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Ferocious and Evil</p>
<p>Strength: 81</p>
<p>Speed: 81</p>
<p>Constitution: 81</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 81</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Evil Deeds Like Wind, Evil Deeds Everywhere, Devouring Whole, Badlands.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Mount</p>
<p>A top Mythical mount! Zhou Wen was first delighted, but when he carefully looked at Qiongqi’s skills and various abilities, his face darkened.</p>
<p>This thing was something that bullied the weak and feared the strong. When encountering evil people, due to the effect of the Companion with Evil Life Soul, not only would its stats decrease, even its skills would weaken.</p>
<p>However, when it came to fighting good people, it was ferocious. When it did good deeds, its stats would drop drastically. When it did evil deeds, its various stats would increase greatly. It was a wonder.</p>
<p>The skill that Zhou Wen couldn’t tolerate the most was Badlands. This skill was a passive skill that didn’t have any lethality. Its only use was that wherever it was, it would make the local area terrible, making people poor and evil. As its owner, he would naturally be the first to bear the brunt. Sooner or later, he would be poor, ferocious, and starving. He wouldn’t even have food to eat.</p>
<p>If I had known this would happen, why would I have spent time grinding for it? Zhou Wen was at a loss whether to laugh or cry as he looked at Qiongqi’s Companion Egg. It was too sinister for incubation.</p>
<p>But if he didn’t incubate it, he would be missing a top-notch mount Companion Beast. In terms of combat strength, it was top-notch. It would be a pity to throw it away.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the Companion Egg with an expression that kept changing. He was in a dilemma.</p>
<h3 id='chapter859'>Chapter 859: Mythical Tiger Soul General</h3>
<p>After some hesitation, Zhou Wen still couldn’t make up his mind whether to incubate it. He first matched the Companion Egg with his pets.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen really wanted to throw it away. None of its skills and abilities made Zhou Wen find them especially useful. They all had various flaws.</p>
<p>The only thing that made it better was that it was especially fierce when it did evil. It was especially powerful when dealing with good people.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen was a devil, Qiongqi would be an excellent-grade demon apart from its Badlands skill. It could unleash extremely powerful combat strength.</p>
<p>The problem was that Zhou Wen didn’t like to do evil, nor did he plan on killing good people. With such a thing and the risk of being poor while having nothing to eat, Zhou Wen really didn’t want to incubate it.</p>
<p>After watching for a while, he realized that Qiongqi’s compatibility with the other Companion Beasts wasn’t high. Just as Zhou Wen was about to throw it away, he thought of the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General he had summoned and matched it.</p>
<p>The 93% compatibility surprised Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Birds of a feather flock together. The compatibility between these two fellows is astonishingly high. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that it was a pity to throw away the Mythical Qiongqi, a top-notch Mythical creature, and its evolutionary ability.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Jinxes Master doesn’t seem to do much to me. Why don’t I try fusing them? Perhaps there will be a good outcome after the two flawed Companion Beasts fuse? Even if they do not change for the better, it won’t be any worse. Zhou Wen decided to give it a try as he placed the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General on the Qiongqi Companion Egg and chose to fuse them.</p>
<p>The 93% compatibility was as genuine as it could be. As a supplementary ingredient, the Qiongqi Companion Egg transformed into a stream of light and entered the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s body, quickly completing the fusion.</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General that had been successfully fused didn’t look much different. However, the tiger under the Tiger Soul General looked a little like Qiongqi.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at its stats and thought to himself, If only I could erase Jinxes Master.</p>
<p>Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General: Mythical (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Malicious Evil</p>
<p>Life Soul: Tiger Soul Runes</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Ferocious and Evil</p>
<p>Strength: 81</p>
<p>Speed: 81</p>
<p>Constitution: 81</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 81</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Tempered Steel Cauldron, Rampage, Magic Stone Curse, One with Horse, Armor-Piercing Spear, Evil Deeds Everywhere, Badlands, Jinxes Master.</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>After seeing the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s stats, Zhou Wen was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>These stats were considered excellent. It was basically impossible to be stronger. It was the first time Zhou Wen had seen a Companion Beast with eight skills. Furthermore, there was a possibility of further improvement in the future. Perhaps it could achieve Terror transformation.</p>
<p>With Jinxes Master still around, Zhou Wen could still accept it. However, what the hell was that wretched Badlands? It actually fused with the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>With Jinxes Master and Badlands, it’s like it’s afraid I won’t die from a single strike. It follows up with execution from a thousand cuts! Zhou Wen had the urge to euthanize the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>However, on second thought, Zhou Wen held back. After all, Jinxes Master probably included being poor. It didn’t matter if there was the additional Badlands.</p>
<p>In the past, Jinxes Master had no effect on him. It didn’t make sense that Badlands could do anything to him.</p>
<p>I’ll observe it first. If I really can’t withstand it, I’ll have to think of a way to euthanize it as soon as possible. Zhou Wen thought to himself and quickly unsummoned Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. He decided to try his best not to let it out.</p>
<p>At the same time, Zhou Wen summoned his baby tiger and got it to follow him, giving him some luck.</p>
<p>After doing all of this, Zhou Wen felt much more relaxed.</p>
<p>As he carefully continued on his way, Zhou Wen heightened his focus. Thankfully, nothing bad happened, allowing him to heave a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Glimmer was much more difficult to evolve than Fine Dust. After walking for so long, Zhou Wen realized that although Glimmer was growing, its growth was very slow. At this rate, he didn’t know how many places he needed to visit to advance Glimmer to a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>The path Zhou Wen took was one that humans were still on; therefore, he didn’t encounter much danger.</p>
<p>On this day, Zhou Wen rode on the Great Might Vajra Bull and walked on a winding mountain road. At night, he had yet to walk out of the mountainous area. In front of him were unending mountains. The winding mountain roads were like snakes coiled around the mountain.</p>
<p>As he walked, he suddenly saw many trucks parked on the road ahead. They looked like a convoy, but he didn’t know why they were parked there.</p>
<p>Typically, convoys would stop at a fixed service area. They wouldn’t usually stop on this mountain road in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Behind the convoy were many soldiers in military uniforms. When they saw the Great Might Vajra Bull, they were shocked. Immediately, many soldiers ran over from the front of the army. Many soldiers raised their guns and aimed at the Great Might Vajra Bull.</p>
<p>When they saw Zhou Wen sitting on the Great Might Vajra Bull’s back, they heaved a sigh of relief. However, they didn’t let down their guard. The dozens of guns were still aimed at Zhou Wen and the Great Might Vajra Bull.</p>
<p>“We are the Federation’s transport team. Who are you?” The officer in the lead shouted at Zhou Wen from afar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t rashly head over. He stopped the Great Might Vajra Bull and asked, “I’m a student of Sunset College. I’m preparing to rush back to Luoyang. What happened here?”</p>
<p>“For some reason, a large portion of the Panshan Road ahead has collapsed. Our vehicles can’t drive over, so we are trying to think of a solution. If you don’t have the ability to fly, I’m afraid you can only reroute,” the officer said.</p>
<p>“I have some flying abilities, but I can’t fly too far. Can you let me take a look?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>The officer discussed with the person beside him for a while before saying to Zhou Wen, “Alright, you can come over, but put away the Companion Beast first.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen put away the Great Might Vajra Bull and walked over with Ya’er in his arms.</p>
<p>“It’s already very dangerous for a student like you to take mountain paths at night. Why are you carrying a child?” the officer said as he looked at Ya’er in Zhou Wen’s arms.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because of a girl like Ya’er that they were willing to let Zhou Wen approach the convoy.</p>
<p>“Bad things are happening to this world. Her parents are gone, so I can only take her to school,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>The soldiers revealed looks of sympathy, and the atmosphere eased a lot.</p>
<p>“This world… Sigh…” The officer sighed and led Zhou Wen forward.</p>
<p>Indeed, a large portion of the mountain road ahead was blocked. It was estimated that several hundred meters of the mountain road had collapsed. The Epic experts in the operations team were using their flying pets to slowly transport the goods and vehicles separately.</p>
<p>However, as there were only three flying pets working, the goods that could be transported at once were very limited, so the progress was very slow.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the broken mountain road and couldn’t help but frown.</p>
<p>The mountain road had almost completely collapsed. Even the mountain wall had collapsed. Zhou Wen looked at it for a while and felt that they had not collapsed naturally, nor did they look like they had been smashed by something heavy. It was more like something had bitten into them.</p>
<h3 id='chapter860'>Chapter 860: Slaying With One Strike</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen sized up his surroundings and looked at the map. He didn’t discover any dimensional zones nearby.</p>
<p>The closest dimensional zone was about sixty kilometers away.</p>
<p>Is there a break-out creature nearby? Zhou Wen didn’t dare let his guard down. He used Truth Listener’s ability to scan the vicinity, but he didn’t find any dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>To be able to cause such damage, it should be very large. Why didn’t I discover it? Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>However, on second thought, it made sense. After such a thing had happened, the transport team would definitely have checked the surroundings. If there was such a huge dimensional creature, it was impossible not to have found it, nor would they have been transporting goods here in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>“Lad, can you fly over?” the officer beside him asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“This distance shouldn’t be a problem,” Zhou Wen answered with a nod.</p>
<p>“You should only do so if you are confident. Don’t take any risks with a child,” the officer exhorted.</p>
<p>“Thank you. I’m confident.” After Zhou Wen thanked her, he leaped up with Ya’er in his arms. After leveraging himself off the mountain wall, he arrived at the mountain pass opposite.</p>
<p>“The students of Sunset College are indeed extraordinary. This movement technique is truly impressive. If I had been able to get into Sunset College back then, I would have long been a section commander after toiling for so many years,” a soldier said enviously when he received the news that Zhou Wen was coming.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t want to be too ostentatious, or he would have flown over. He never expected such a movement technique to be praised by the typical soldier.</p>
<p>“When you got here, was the road already like this?” Zhou Wen asked one of the soldiers.</p>
<p>“That’s right. When we were about forty to fifty kilometers away, we heard a loud bang. At that time, we were wondering what had happened. Only when we arrived did we realize that the road had collapsed,” the soldier answered.</p>
<p>If it were anywhere else, it might be difficult to hear sounds. However, this was a mountain road. The distance of forty to fifty kilometers was the travel distance; the actual straight-line distance wasn’t that far.</p>
<p>It won’t take long to travel forty to fifty kilometers here. If there really are break-out creatures, theoretically speaking, they shouldn’t be able to go far. Zhou Wen constantly used Truth Listener to scan the area. This time, he focused on scanning the forest at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>This was because Zhou Wen previously felt that the dimensional creature was likely very large. It was impossible for it to be hidden in the forest.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there were no signs of the forest being destroyed. It didn’t look like a behemoth had passed by.</p>
<p>However, for safety’s sake, Zhou Wen carefully scanned the forest.</p>
<p>As there weren’t any dimensional zones nearby, the forest below didn’t undergo much mutation. The trees weren’t too tall either. Zhou Wen scanned the area for a while, thinking that he wouldn’t find anything, but suddenly, he discovered a creature rushing through the forest.</p>
<p>The creature looked like a centipede. It was huge and its body was probably the thickness of a bucket. Its upper body had a human torso, legs, and head. It looked extremely strange.</p>
<p>It advanced through the forest and was almost at the mountain path.</p>
<p>What dimensional creature is this? Was the mountain path destroyed by it? Zhou Wen didn’t have time to think as he said to the soldiers, “There seems to be a dimensional creature in the forest below. Quickly evacuate the gap. Don’t get too close.”</p>
<p>The soldier was taken aback. He looked down and didn’t see anything. He used the walkie-talkie to pass Zhou Wen’s words to the officer across him.</p>
<p>The officer hurriedly got someone to carefully observe the situation below. While they were still observing, they saw the monster with a centipede tail crawl out of the mountain wall.</p>
<p>“Dimensional creature. Prepare to fire.” The officer immediately gave the order to shoot. Essence Gold bullets rained down on the dimensional creature.</p>
<p>The hard bullets appeared to shoot into rubber and stuck in its body. The terrifying thing was that the bullets quickly melted into its body as though they had been absorbed by its body.</p>
<p>Seeing that the Essence Gold bullets were ineffective, the Epic officer ordered a giant eagle Companion Beast to release a claw beam from the sky to attack the monster.</p>
<p>The monster looked up and glanced at the giant eagle. A blood-red beam shot out from its eyes. When the beam touched the giant eagle’s body, it immediately plummeted from the sky. While still in midair, it had already melted into a pool of blood.</p>
<p>The officer was alarmed. Their transport team had two Epic officers. Together, they had five Epic Companion Beasts. With such strength, they could deal with ordinary emergencies unless they encountered Mythical creatures.</p>
<p>Now, an Epic Lightning Eagle had been killed in one strike. Such strength seemed to have exceeded the Epic stage.</p>
<p>“Retreat, everyone fall back.” The officer gave the order, but it was too late.</p>
<p>Before the soldiers could board the vehicle, the monster had already climbed up the mountain wall. Its eyes suffused with a red glow. When the beam of light landed on the truck, it melted.</p>
<p>Everyone’s hearts were covered in a shadow. Having encountered such a terrifying dimensional creature, they were probably doomed.</p>
<p>“Retreat! Retreat immediately! Commander Yan and I will provide cover. The rest of you retreat immediately. Ignore the goods. Retreat immediately!” As the officer roared, he summoned his Companion Beasts to hold back the monster and cover the others’ retreat.</p>
<p>The monster’s body, which was dozens of meters long, climbed up the mountain wall and let out a strange roar. Its red eyes shot red beams at the officer.</p>
<p>The officer quickly dodged. At the same time, he slashed out a sword beam with an Epic Companion Beast sword in his hand, hoping to slice through the monster’s centipede-like body.</p>
<p>However, just as he moved, the centipede-like body swept over. The countless centipede feet were about to grab his body.</p>
<p>The officer’s sword beam slashed at the centipede, but the sword beam scattered like glass after shattering. It failed to deal any damage.</p>
<p>“It’s over!” The officer’s face was pale. He had already tried his best to retreat, but the difference in speed was too great. He was unable to dodge the centipede’s attack.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a golden sword beam descended from the sky like a bolt of lightning, illuminating everyone’s eyes.</p>
<p>In the next second, they saw the golden sword beam cleave the monster’s body in half. The monster split into two and fell down the cliff.</p>
<p>At that moment, they saw the spot where the golden sword beam had vanished. A figure held a golden sword in one hand and a girl in the other. He was floating above the broken road. It was naturally Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The officer and soldiers were dumbfounded as they looked at Zhou Wen in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your help,” the officer said as he saluted Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid it’s not safe here. There are other dimensional creatures. It’s best you leave quickly,” Zhou Wen said as he summoned Tyrant Behemoth and made it grow in size.</p>
<p>“Tyrant Behemoth… That’s Tyrant Behemoth… So Tyrant Behemoth isn’t a Companion Beast from the West District…” the soldiers immediately shouted when they saw Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<h3 id='chapter861'>Chapter 861: Mountain God Temple</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen directly ordered Tyrant Behemoth to help the transport team take their trucks and goods to the other side of the broken road.</p>
<p>The trucks were like toys in front of Tyrant Behemoth. It could pick them up with one hand.</p>
<p>Soon, all the trucks, goods, and people had been moved to the other side of the broken road.</p>
<p>“May I know your name?” the officer asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen,” Zhou Wen answered before saying to the officer, “Leave quickly. This isn’t just the only dimensional creature. There are even more terrifying existences. There might be danger if you continue delaying.”</p>
<p>The officer bowed at Zhou Wen and didn’t dawdle. He immediately instructed all the soldiers to board the vehicle and leave with the goods.</p>
<p>“Commander Jin, I never expected Tyrant Behemoth to be a Companion Beast of our East District. Furthermore, it’s owned by such a young student. That Zhou Wen is really impressive. Not only are his Companion Beasts powerful, but he’s also powerful. He killed such a terrifying dimensional creature with a single strike. If humanity’s students are as powerful as him, would we need to be afraid of dimensional creatures in the future?” the soldier beside him said excitedly to the officer.</p>
<p>Jin Shihao shook his head and said with a bitter smile, “I’m afraid there might not even be one such person in a billion people. It’s just impossible for them to protect all of humanity. We soldiers are also very important. Therefore, we have to work hard to become stronger. Even if we can’t reach their level, we can still protect our compatriots who are weaker than us.”</p>
<p>“Although that’s the case, I’m afraid we won’t be able to possess such strength for the rest of our lives.” The soldier sighed.</p>
<p>Jin Shihao cursed, “If everyone thinks like you, humanity is probably doomed. If we can’t do it now, it doesn’t mean that we won’t be able to do it in the future. Did the humans of ancient times imagine that everyone would have a phone one day? Back in times of peace, would people have thought that everyone would be holding a gun to do battle? People like Zhou Wen are the pioneers of the times. One day, pioneers like them will bring powerful Companion Beasts, Essence Energy Arts, and Essence Energy Skills to everyone. When that happens, humanity will truly be able to change the world. We have to work hard to become stronger. If that day really comes and we don’t even have the ability to helm those powers, we will really be doomed.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Commander, I understand what you mean. By standing on the shoulders of giants we can see further. However, seeing it with our own eyes is still too shocking. He’s clearly so young, but he actually has such strength. Is the difference in talent between humans that huge?” the soldier said wistfully.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen constantly scanned the forest below. The collapse of the mountain path was definitely not something the dead dimensional creature could do. There had to be stronger dimensional creatures nearby.</p>
<p>However, he scanned the forest repeatedly and didn’t discover anything else.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen put on the Invisibility Cloak and wrapped Ya’er in it before heading in the direction the centipede monster had come from.</p>
<p>The dense forest was dark and eerie under the moonlight. Zhou Wen didn’t enter the forest, afraid that something would happen, so he flew above it.</p>
<p>With the Invisibility Cloak on him and the Earth Elemental Beast ready to fight at any moment, Zhou Wen’s escaping ability was at its peak. With Truth Listener’s ability, he could escape even if he couldn’t defeat the adversary.</p>
<p>He didn’t discover anything along the way. Thankfully, the smell from the centipede monster was still present. Zhou Wen followed the smell and turned towards a mountain before discovering something.</p>
<p>There was a hill over there, standing at less than two to three hundred meter, but it was rather steep. On the mountain’s peak, there was a building that resembled a temple.</p>
<p>There’s actually an Earth Temple in such a place? Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He observed the hill and didn’t find any stone steps leading up.</p>
<p>Strange, there aren’t any stone steps. How did the ancients build it? Zhou Wen carefully sized up the temple and realized that there was incense burning inside.</p>
<p>There was a wooden plaque hanging above the temple’s entrance. On the wooden plaque were the words “Mountain God Temple.”</p>
<p>So it’s not an Earth Temple, but a Mountain God Temple. Zhou Wen frowned slightly.</p>
<p>If it was an Earth Temple, there was no need to worry too much. This was because the nature of Earth Temples in the East District were similar. Typically, there wouldn’t be too much danger. They even provided benefits at times.</p>
<p>However, Mountain God Temples were different. Mountain God Temples were divided into temples that consecrated orthodox and evil gods. Orthodox Mountain God Temples were similar to Earth Temples, so they weren’t very dangerous.</p>
<p>However, it was difficult to say for the Mountain God Temples that consecrated evil gods.</p>
<p>Some so-called mountain gods were actually demons that had developed sentience in the mountains. There were good and bad demons, and their personalities were completely different. It was because of their magical abilities that humans treated them as mountain gods to worship.</p>
<p>However, these mountain gods might not protect humans. There were even many mountain gods who wantonly killed humans. They made humans so afraid of them that they were worshiped.</p>
<p>Although the Mountain God Temple on the mountain wasn’t big, it was rather exquisitely built. It was made of pure wood, and there was incense burning inside. As the words “Mountain God Temple” were written, Zhou Wen didn’t know what the Mountain God inside looked like.</p>
<p>That centipede monster should have come from the Mountain God Temple. From the looks of it, the Mountain God here is most likely an evil god. The collapsed mountain path probably has something to do with this Mountain God, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen focused Truth Listener’s power on the Mountain God Temple, wanting to know what was inside.</p>
<p>As a mysterious force enveloped the Mountain God Temple, he previously couldn’t clearly hear the situation inside. Now that Truth Listener was doing its best, the scene inside the Mountain God Temple gradually surfaced in Zhou Wen’s mind.</p>
<p>The temple hall was simple. On an offering table, there was something consecrated. There was an incense burner in front of it. There was incense in the burner, and there were candles on both sides. He did not know who had lit the incense.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw what was in the temple, his expression turned odd.</p>
<p>It’s indeed an evil god’s Mountain God Temple. I’ve seen offerings for Snake Immortals, Fox Immortals, and Yellow Immortals. This is the first time I’ve seen someone giving offerings to a toad. Zhou Wen looked at the Mountain God Temple and couldn’t help but be curious.</p>
<p>What was consecrated in the Mountain God Temple looked like a toad. The fat statue was sprawled on the table with its eyes closed, as though it was enjoying itself.</p>
<p>Its entire body seemed to be made of copper. There were many spots on its body, making it look ugly. If it were Zhou Wen, he definitely wouldn’t consecrate such a mountain god.</p>
<p>However, after taking a closer look, Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>It looked like a toad lying there, but upon closer inspection, he discovered that this fellow was somewhat different from a toad.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was carefully observing it, he saw it open its eyes and look at him.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter862'>Chapter 862: Fortune Devouring</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen wore the Invisibility Cloak. Although he wasn’t completely invisible, he was still visually invisible. The toad-like mountain god stared straight at Zhou Wen, clearly able to see him.</p>
<p>The mountain god looked at Zhou Wen and opened his mouth to let out a strange cry.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed as he quickly retreated. At the same time, he drew the Golden Overlord Sword to prevent any possible attacks.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t discover any terrifying forces rushing out of the Mountain God Temple, but his pocket twitched before everything turned still again.</p>
<p>What happened? Zhou Wen was somewhat confused. He knew that something must have happened as he reached into his pocket and his expression immediately turned odd.</p>
<p>His pocket was as good as before, but the change he had inside was gone. There were only a few hundred bucks in total. Zhou Wen had kept it on him as a backup if he needed to get a ride or for daily necessities.</p>
<p>Now, not a single cent remained. It had vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>Is it that mountain god’s doing? But how did it do it? As Zhou Wen was alarmed, the mountain god cried at him again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly flew to dodge. He didn’t know what the mountain god’s strength was, so he could only try his best to distance himself from it to prevent any more losses.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen was still too late. With the mountain god’s strange cry, Zhou Wen felt his wrist lighten as the bracelet he had been wearing vanished.</p>
<p>Not good! Zhou Wen was alarmed. The bracelet wasn’t worth much to begin with. It was fine if he lost it, but it was embedded with Chaos Bead. There were many things inside the Chaos Bead that couldn’t be lost.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately summoned Tyrant Behemoth and made it gigantic. He threw a huge fist at the Mountain God Temple on top of the hill, hoping to smash it to pieces.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The toad-like Mountain God Temple rushed out. Its body rapidly expanded to the point of being comparable to Tyrant Behemoth. Its head collided with Tyrant Behemoth’s fist.</p>
<p>It was unknown what its head was made of, but it was extremely hard. Tyrant Behemoth’s fist seemed to strike steel. It failed to injure the mountain god.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen see that although the fellow was ugly, it wasn’t a toad. Its body was like a lion, its feet were like a Qilin, and its head was like a dragon. The spots on its body weren’t spots, but copper coin-shaped scales.</p>
<p>The copper coin-shaped scales covered its body. When its body shrank, it looked like a lump on a toad’s body.</p>
<p>Could this thing be the legendary Pixiu? Zhou Wen looked at it and connected it to its previous abilities. He immediately thought of a legendary mythical beast.</p>
<p>Legend had it that the mythical beast, Pixiu, was also known as Tianlu, Evil Warding, and Hundred Cures. It was an auspicious beast that could exorcise evil and ward off calamity. It ate the wealth from everywhere, and it only ate without excreting. It could attract wealth and treasures, only allowing entry and not exit.</p>
<p>Anyone who wanted to get rich would have a divine beast like a Pixiu in their home or shop.</p>
<p>The more Zhou Wen looked at this fellow, the more it resembled the legendary Pixiu. It wasn’t at a disadvantage when fighting Tyrant Behemoth when it came to Strength, Speed, or Constitution.</p>
<p>It bit down and bit off a piece of a hill beside it. Its combat strength was extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>It’s definitely the one who gnawed off the mountain path. Zhou Wen ordered the Golden Overlord Sword to slash at Pixiu, hoping to help Tyrant Behemoth kill it and see if he could get the Chaos Bead from its stomach.</p>
<p>Seeing the Golden Overlord Sword fly over, Pixiu opened its mouth and let out a strange cry. It sucked the Golden Overlord Sword into its stomach.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, this fellow’s ability is a little sick. It can even devour a Mythical weapon? Zhou Wen was dumbfounded. He didn’t attack blindly and instead distanced himself from it. He observed its battle with Tyrant Behemoth from afar, hoping to find its weakness before attacking.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth couldn’t gain the upper hand. It roared and used Absolute Strength. Its powerful strength immediately suppressed Pixiu as it punched at it, sending it rolling around the mountain.</p>
<p>However, Pixiu had thick skin and flesh. It was only slightly injured, so Tyrant Behemoth couldn’t kill it anytime soon.</p>
<p>This infuriated Pixiu. It opened its mouth and, like a monster that was devouring the world, let out a strange cry that sounded like a bull.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, who had retreated far away, felt his body tremble. Some of his valuable items had vanished. Even the accessories he had bought for Ya’er had vanished.</p>
<p>What was even more exaggerated was that the ground beneath cracked open, revealing a gold mine. Large amounts of gold ore surged into the Pixiu’s mouth, causing its body to glow with golden light as though it was made of gold.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>Perhaps because it had devoured a large amount of gold ore, Pixiu was actually on a par with Tyrant Behemoth, who had activated Absolute Strength. Even if it was inferior, it was difficult for Tyrant Behemoth to severely injure it.</p>
<p>Not long after, the golden light on Pixiu’s body dimmed significantly, perhaps a result of expending all the energy from devouring the gold mine. This was when it suddenly rushed out.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth chased after it relentlessly. After crossing several mountains, Pixiu roared again. The ground split open, revealing a silver mine beneath.</p>
<p>A large amount of silver ore flew into Pixiu’s mouth, causing its body to emit a silver glow. Its combat strength increased once again as it fought Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Tyrant Behemoth had never been afraid of anyone in a melee battle. It fought Pixiu crazily, causing the surrounding mountains to collapse. Large craters appeared on the ground as large swaths of the forest were destroyed.</p>
<p>Before long, the silver light on Pixiu’s body dimmed again. It fled towards the mountainous area again. Soon, it found another copper mine and devoured it to fight Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>After a long struggle, the light on Pixiu’s body slowly dimmed. Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength time was up as well. The two ferocious beasts had passed their peak, but they were still battling each other in exhaustion. They looked extremely ferocious.</p>
<p>This fellow has the ability to devour wealth and sense wealth. As long as I have something related to wealth on me, I’ll be sensed if I approach it. If I want to kill it, I can only lightly equip myself. With a thought, Zhou Wen first sent Ya’er to a safe place before placing all the items that were worth something beside her. Then, he put on the Invisibility Cloak and used its Invisibility ability to secretly approach Pixiu.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t use the Light Concealment Sword. Such a sword might be considered a treasure. If Pixiu were to discover it and devour it, it wouldn’t be worth it.</p>
<p>He approached Pixiu from behind, but this time, it didn’t discover him. Zhou Wen didn’t use a weapon and only summoned Doctor Darkness to get him to fuse his soul with him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter863'>Chapter 863: Three Copper Coins</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>After fusing, Zhou Wen arrived behind Pixiu. His Eyes of Penetration activated, allowing him to see through Pixiu’s body.</p>
<p>The Golden Overlord Sword had already been melted and absorbed by Pixiu, making Zhou Wen’s heart ache. Such a divine weapon had been destroyed by it.</p>
<p>The gold, silver, and copper ore that it had devoured had mostly melted. Thankfully, Zhou Wen saw that the Chaos Bead hadn’t been melted and absorbed. The bracelet was gone, leaving only a bead.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Chaos Bead is still here. Zhou Wen took the opportunity to use Doctor Darkness’s Wheel of Destiny while Pixiu and Tyrant Behemoth were fighting.</p>
<p>Darkness Right Hand was activated as Zhou Wen’s right hand reached into the back of Pixiu’s head and stirred it, tearing a huge chunk of its brain apart.</p>
<p>As it was too big, Darkness Right Hand couldn’t pluck out its entire brain. It could only do its best to cause damage.</p>
<p>Pixiu let out a tragic cry. Tyrant Behemoth took the opportunity to press it to the ground. It rode on its body and pummeled it with its fists.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t stay idle either. He used the remaining two Darkness Right Hand abilities consecutively, turning its brain into a mess.</p>
<p>With problems arising in Pixiu’s brain, it no longer had the ability to resist. It was repeatedly struck in the chest by Tyrant Behemoth, and its struggles weakened.</p>
<p>Seeing that it no longer had the ability to suck wealth, Zhou Wen summoned the Light Concealment Sword and slashed its neck.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth extended its claws into the wound and forcefully ripped open the wound. Finally, it tore off its head. A divine beast had died.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned Truth Listener and let the mini Truth Listener enter its stomach to take out the Chaos Bead.</p>
<p>Soon, Truth Listener crawled out again. It held the Chaos Bead in one claw, but there was something else in the other claw.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a careful look and saw that the item Truth Listener had pulled out was three copper coins tied with a red string. The copper coins were circular on its outer rim, but there was a square hole in the middle. As they were too ancient, the patterns and words on them couldn’t be seen clearly. They were strung together by a red string, making them look inconspicuous.</p>
<p>However, this item wasn’t digested or absorbed by Pixiu’s stomach. Clearly, it wasn’t an ordinary item.</p>
<p>Truth Listener placed the Chaos Bead and copper coins in Zhou Wen’s hand. Zhou Wen took the copper coins and looked at them, but he didn’t find anything special. He first put away the copper coins before using his penetrative vision to look at Pixiu’s body.</p>
<p>There aren’t any Companion Eggs or dimensional crystals? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be disappointed. Pixiu’s abilities were very special. It would have been good to obtain a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pixiu didn’t drop anything. He even lost the Golden Overlord Sword, making Zhou Wen feel like he had suffered a huge loss.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I’ll have to think of a way to fuse a new weapon that’s similar to the Golden Overlord Sword, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>However, Ever-Victorious was too difficult to farm. The success rate of fusion wasn’t high either. The chances of fusing an identical Golden Overlord Sword were very low.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen didn’t have OCD. All he needed to do was fuse Ever-Victorious and Unstoppable into one weapon.</p>
<p>I wonder if I can fuse those skills onto the Light Concealment Sword. Zhou Wen had that thought. He could only slowly try it in the future.</p>
<p>After searching the area and finding no other dimensional creatures, Zhou Wen left with Ya’er.</p>
<p>These copper coins don’t seem to be anything special. Why weren’t they digested by Pixiu? On the way back, Zhou Wen studied the three copper coins, but no matter what Essence Energy Art he injected, he couldn’t activate them.</p>
<p>Apart from being harder than the typical copper coin, Zhou Wen didn’t see any use for them.</p>
<p>I should think of a way to get a weapon. Zhou Wen also had a Mutated Overlord Snake that he had previously obtained. It had the Ever-Victorious ability.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when Zhou Wen matched it with the Light Concealment Sword, he found the compatibility to be pitifully low—less than twenty.</p>
<p>The Golden Battle God Halberd’s compatibility with the Light Concealment Sword wasn’t high either. It was only 31. Zhou Wen didn’t dare mess around with such a success rate.</p>
<p>It doesn’t seem realistic to fuse these two skills with the Light Concealment Sword. What if I fuse them with a sword-type Companion Beast before fusing them with the Light Concealment Sword? Zhou Wen decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>After grinding the Ancient Sword Tomb for so long, he didn’t obtain any other Mythical swords. However, he obtained quite a number of Epic and Legendary swords.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used the swords to match the Overlord Snake and Golden Battle God Halberd and quickly found one with a higher compatibility score.</p>
<p>He first used a sword to fuse with the Overlord Snake, but with a high compatibility of 63, the fusion ended up failing.</p>
<p>He used the Golden Battle God Halberd and another Epic sword to fuse. This time, the fusion succeeded, but the Unstoppable skill was deleted from the fusion.</p>
<p>Why is my luck so bad? Zhou Wen thought of the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s newly added Badlands skill and felt a little uneasy. Could it be that the skill is showing its effects? I’ve suffered quite a loss this time…</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Without the Golden Battle God Halberd and Mutated Overlord Snake as ingredients, it was impossible to continue any fusion. Zhou Wen had no choice but to temporarily give up on his previous plans and wait for a Companion Egg to drop.</p>
<p>Along the way, Zhou Wen focused his attention on grinding dungeons. He focused on the Endless Sea of Stars and the Ancient Sword Tomb. He wanted to obtain the complete 28 Lunar Mansion skills from the Endless Sea of Stars. He also wanted to obtain another Mythical Sword from the Ancient Sword Tomb.</p>
<p>The Light Concealment Sword was very powerful when used for assassination, but it wasn’t suitable in a head-on battle. Zhou Wen still needed a weapon for melee battles.</p>
<p>It was unknown if his luck had really changed for the worse. After grinding for a few days, nothing decent dropped. Instead, quite a number of useless Companion Eggs dropped.</p>
<p>Since he had to walk around to advance his Glimmer Life Soul, Zhou Wen took a detour to the Founding Emperor Tomb. He wanted to see if there was a tiny palm symbol to download the dungeon.</p>
<p>Before reaching the Founding Emperor Tomb, Zhou Wen saw a bustling town-like market. Many people were selling dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs produced in the Founding Emperor Tomb.</p>
<p>There were many unique Companion Eggs in the Founding Emperor Tomb, such as the Bronze Men that Zhou Wen had seen before and the Earth Elemental Beast. They were all from the Founding Emperor Tomb.</p>
<p>However, the Founding Emperor Tomb that humans knew of was actually only the periphery of the Founding Emperor Tomb. It was impossible to enter the tomb’s interior.</p>
<p>If the Founding Emperor Tomb was considered a huge underground city, the area that humans were in contact with now wouldn’t even reach the city gates.</p>
<p>Besides the legendary six heroes, no one had entered the true Founding Emperor Tomb.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was just about to pass through the bazaar and head to the periphery of the Founding Emperor Tomb to search for the tiny palm symbol when he saw a commotion in the bazaar. He didn’t know what the group was doing.</p>
<p>After paying a little attention, Zhou Wen realized that Liu Yun was in the crowd, arguing with an old man.</p>
<p>Liu Yun doesn’t do anything unless there are benefits involved. What’s he doing here? Zhou Wen’s interest was piqued as he found a corner that no one was paying attention to and secretly observed Liu Yun’s every move.</p>
<h3 id='chapter864'>Chapter 864: Selling the Sword</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen watched from the side for a while before finally understanding the reason behind Liu Yun’s argument with the old man.</p>
<p>Liu Yun insisted on buying the old man’s bronze sword, but the old man refused to sell it no matter what. One insisted on buying while the other refused to sell. Therefore, they began arguing.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that the old man really wasn’t selling it, but that the old man insisted on using the bronze sword to exchange for a Mythical Companion Beast. Otherwise, he wouldn’t sell it no matter how much money was given.</p>
<p>The old man also said that his bronze sword had been dug out from the Founding Emperor Tomb before the dimensional storms. It was the Founding Emperor’s sword.</p>
<p>No one believed him. Even if it was really the Founding Emperor’s sword, it wasn’t worth much in modern times. At most, it was an antique.</p>
<p>However, the old man insisted on exchanging the sword for a Mythical Companion Beast. It was unknown what Liu Yun was up to. He insisted on buying the sword, but he couldn’t produce a Mythical Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Something’s amiss. How can a thick-skinned fellow like Liu Yun buy a sword so honestly? It’s even more impossible for him to make a din here. If he really wanted that sword, he should have secretly stolen it… What is this fellow trying to do? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you three Epic Bronze Man Companion Eggs in exchange for your sword,” Liu Yun said to the old man.</p>
<p>“I won’t exchange even for ten, much less three.” The old man was very stubborn. He hugged the bronze sword and refused to let go. He was dead stubborn.</p>
<p>When others heard that Liu Yun wanted to exchange three Bronze Man Companion Eggs for a crappy bronze sword, they were alarmed.</p>
<p>“How about five? This is all I have,” Liu Yun said as he placed five Companion Eggs in front of the old man.</p>
<p>Everyone was alarmed when they saw this. There were very few locals who didn’t know the Bronze Man Companion Egg. Even if they hadn’t personally obtained one, they had definitely seen one.</p>
<p>The five Companion Eggs that Liu Yun took out were undoubtedly Bronze Men.</p>
<p>“Dude, you have five Bronze Man Companion Eggs. Why don’t you exchange them for something good? Why do you have to exchange them for his crappy sword?” a person beside him said.</p>
<p>Everyone agreed. Bronze Man Companion Eggs were very famous, but there weren’t many of them, so their prices were very high. To be able to produce five at once was something even the elderly who had been setting up stalls here had never seen.</p>
<p>“Nothing else. I just like that sword. I think it might be a treasure,” Liu Yun said casually.</p>
<p>“This is obviously a treasure. If you want it, you can exchange it using a Mythical Companion Beast. Otherwise, it’s useless no matter what you say,” the old man said firmly.</p>
<p>Everyone found Liu Yun and the old man crazy. Liu Yun was a prodigal, and the old man was a fool.</p>
<p>A burly man squeezed forward and looked at the five Bronze Man Companion Eggs on the ground. He swallowed his saliva and said to Liu Yun, “Brother, I have a sword that’s about the same as his. If you want it, I’ll sell it for five Bronze Man Companion Eggs.”</p>
<p>“I want a treasure sword dug out from the Founding Emperor Tomb. Do you think I want any sword?” Liu Yun curled his lips.</p>
<p>“Hey, what the hell are you saying. This sword of mine was a treasure my great-grandfather dug out from the Founding Emperor Tomb,” the man hurriedly said.</p>
<p>“For real?” Liu Yun looked at the sword in his hand in disbelief.</p>
<p>Indeed, the two ancient swords were very similar with only slight differences. From a comprehensive take of the two swords, they likely originated from the same period.</p>
<p>“Of course it’s real. It’s definitely more real than that old man’s,” the man said as he patted his chest.</p>
<p>However, the old man said coldly, “Don’t be greedy for small gains. If you are greedy, you will suffer a huge loss. What’s the point of buying a fake with five Companion Eggs?”</p>
<p>“Old man, whose goods are you calling fake? You are the one selling a fake,” the man said angrily.</p>
<p>Liu Yun laughed and said to the old man, “Old man, don’t tell me you are regretting it? It’s too late for regrets now. I won’t buy your sword. Let’s see who else will offer such a high price.”</p>
<p>With that said, Liu Yun pushed the five Companion Eggs towards the man and said, “I don’t care if yours is genuine or fake. I’ll buy yours. I want to let that old fool regret it.”</p>
<p>The burly man was overjoyed as he hurriedly took the Bronze Man Companion Eggs. He was still worried, so he got someone to check them for him. After confirming that they were Bronze Man Companion Eggs, he handed the ancient sword to Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“Old Man, just wallow in regret.” As Liu Yun spoke, he left.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen put on the Invisibility Cloak and secretly followed.</p>
<p>Liu Yun didn’t go to the town. After making a turn, he ran to a nearby forest and sat on a large tree root to smoke.</p>
<p>After a while, he saw the old man who was trying to sell the sword sneak into the forest.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw the elder, he immediately came to a realization. The two of them were in cahoots. They had caused a commotion just to make the burly man sell his sword.</p>
<p>The burly man was a freelance hunter who had entered a dimensional zone. He wasn’t selling things at a stall. They definitely wanted the burly man’s sword, but it wasn’t convenient for them to just buy it from him, so they had set up such a trap.</p>
<p>What’s that ancient sword? Is it worth Liu Yun spending so much effort on? Zhou Wen secretly sized up the ancient sword in Liu Yun’s arms.</p>
<p>“How is it? Is it real?” the old man asked Liu Yun after entering.</p>
<p>“There’s no problem. It’s real. With this sword, we can enter the Founding Emperor Tomb,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“Let me take a look,” the old man said as he went to take the sword.</p>
<p>However, Liu Yun retracted his hand and didn’t let the old man touch the sword. He said with a smile, “Why are you in such a rush? Didn’t we agree that I’ll hold the sword and open the door? When we return, we’ll split the items equally. With the sword with me, don’t worry because nothing will go wrong.”</p>
<p>“I’m just afraid that you’ll be cheated. I’ll help you take a look and see if that’s really the Emperor Qin Sword,” the old man said without changing his expression.</p>
<p>“I have always been the scammer, not the other way. Don’t worry.” Liu Yun held the ancient sword and asked the old man, “When are we going to take action?”</p>
<p>“The sooner the better. If you’re ready, we’ll take action tonight,” the old man said.</p>
<p>“Alright, it’s settled then. We’ll meet outside the Founding Emperor Tomb tonight.” Liu Yun turned around and left.</p>
<p>The old man watched Liu Yun’s back disappear before turning to leave.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen secretly looked in the direction the old man had left and fell into thought. He had a nagging feeling that the old man was somewhat familiar, as though he had seen him somewhere before. However, from his face and figure, he didn’t seem to have any impression of him.</p>
<p>This old man… Don’t tell me he’s Jing Daoxian… An idea suddenly flashed in Zhou Wen’s mind as he thought of that familiar feeling.</p>
<p>This was because the aura the old man occasionally exuded was very similar to Jing Daoxian’s, but his appearance and figure were different.</p>
<p>Changing his looks and figure shouldn’t be difficult for Jing Daoxian. I think it’s most likely him. However, why is he with Liu Yun? Why do the two of them want to enter the Founding Emperor Tomb? Zhou Wen was filled with curiosity.</p>
<h3 id='chapter865'>Chapter 865: Xie Yukun</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that this had nothing to do with him. He didn’t plan on entering the Founding Emperor Tomb, so he stopped making wild guesses.</p>
<p>After circling around, he returned to the periphery of the Founding Emperor Tomb. He searched for the tiny palm symbol at the edge of the tomb, hoping to gain something.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no intention of entering the Founding Emperor Tomb to begin with. Now that he knew that Liu Yun and Jing Daoxian were entering, he was even less likely to enter. All he did was walk around the periphery.</p>
<p>There were terracotta soldiers on the periphery. They were basically at the Legendary stage, and further in were Epic Bronze Men. It was said that there were also Mythical Gold Men, but they were extremely rare. Zhou Wen didn’t see them.</p>
<p>When he was about to reach the Founding Emperor Tomb, Zhou Wen slowed down. He definitely wouldn’t enter the imperial mausoleum. All he needed to do was look for the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>In the dungeon that Zhou Wen had downloaded, there was already a Thirteen Mausoleum. It was the only game dungeon that Zhou Wen had yet to enter.</p>
<p>The main reason was that there were some mysterious things in that dungeon. If one didn’t handle it well, problems would arise. More importantly, he couldn’t find the entrance and could only circle around the periphery.</p>
<p>A place like a mausoleum was not meant for entry to begin with, so it was naturally impossible for there to be an entrance. If one wanted to enter, they could only dig their way in.</p>
<p>It was the same for the Founding Emperor Tomb. There were no doors, but there were numerous holes dug nearby. It was said that many people wanted to enter, but things would happen midway. Up to now, only the six heroes had successfully entered.</p>
<p>Using Truth Listener’s ability, Zhou Wen carefully searched the area. His luck wasn’t bad. He found the tiny palm symbol on a stone beast that was half buried in the ground.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted as he hurriedly snapped a picture of the tiny palm symbol. The game entered the download screen.</p>
<p>After waiting for a while, it still hadn’t downloaded successfully. This dungeon was probably a more important one.</p>
<p>Having had the phone for so long, Zhou Wen realized that the speed at which he downloaded the game had nothing to do with the size of the map. Typically, when the download took longer, there would be something especially powerful or mysterious inside.</p>
<p>It was getting late and he had already obtained the instance dungeon. In order not to bump into Liu Yun and Jing Daoxian, Zhou Wen planned on leaving and continuing his travels.</p>
<p>To his surprise, when he reached the main road, he saw Liu Yun leaning against a tree by the side of the road and looking at him with a faint smile.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, I never expected us to meet again so soon,” Liu Yun said with a smile.</p>
<p>This fellow must have spotted me long ago. Zhou Wen knew very well. He looked at Liu Yun and said, “Eldest Senior Brother, have you thought it through and want to help me take care of Ya’er?”</p>
<p>When Liu Yun heard Ya’er’s name, his heart couldn’t help but tremble. He looked at Ya’er, who was in Zhou Wen’s arms, and hurriedly shook his head. “I came to discuss something with you. You should have heard my conversation with that old man. Are you interested in entering the Founding Emperor Tomb together? This sword is the key to entering the Founding Emperor Tomb. With it and your Earth Elemental Beast, we can safely enter and take whatever we want.”</p>
<p>“No,” Zhou Wen said bluntly.</p>
<p>“Don’t you want to know what’s inside the Founding Emperor Tomb? It’s…” Liu Yun was slightly taken aback. He was about to say something when Zhou Wen interrupted him again.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to know or go,” Zhou Wen said as he circled around Liu Yun and continued walking forward.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that there might be danger in the Founding Emperor Tomb, Zhou Wen definitely wouldn’t go with the suspected Jing Daoxian around.</p>
<p>Even Liu Yun had discovered him, so Zhou Wen didn’t believe that Jing Daoxian hadn’t discovered him. It was best not to get involved.</p>
<p>“I heard that there’s an Elixir of Immortality in the Founding Emperor Tomb. One can become immortal after eating it.” Liu Yun refused to give up as he followed Zhou Wen, hoping to persuade him.</p>
<p>“Not going.” Zhou Wen’s attitude was firm. Even if Liu Yun gave the best pitch, he wouldn’t enter the Founding Emperor Tomb.</p>
<p>“There’s still a Guardian cocoon in the Founding Emperor Tomb. If you enter, you might have a chance of contracting a Guardian,” Liu Yun continued.</p>
<p>“Not going.” He never expected such good news. However, even if there were Guardians inside, Zhou Wen wouldn’t go.</p>
<p>Since his phone was already downloading the game dungeon, he could still fight the Guardian in-game. There was no need for him to take the risk.</p>
<p>“Do you know who that old man is?” Liu Yun suddenly asked when he saw that Zhou Wen was determined not to go to the Founding Emperor Tomb.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>He never expected Zhou Wen to answer in such a manner. Liu Yun was taken aback before he asked in disbelief, “You know who that old man is? That’s impossible, right? You shouldn’t have seen him. He’s a dead person.”</p>
<p>“Who do you think he is?” Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss when he heard Liu Yun’s words. He stopped and asked him.</p>
<p>Everyone knew that Jing Daoxian wasn’t dead. Even when he was injured the last time and had nearly lost his ability to fight, the bureau’s setting up of a virtually inescapable net had failed to capture him.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t be unfamiliar with the Zhuolu expedition team, right? That old man is one of the members of the expedition team,” Liu Yun said mysteriously.</p>
<p>“Impossible. I’ve seen all the members of the expedition team. There’s no such person,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen’s reaction, Liu Yun knew that there was a chance. He chuckled and said, “As long as you have read the information on the experts and staff members of the expedition team, it’s not surprising that you know them. But have you ever thought that there might be some people who aren’t in the records?”</p>
<p>“I don’t have time to listen to your nonsense. It’s impossible to let an outsider stay in the team for such a large-scale inspection,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“He’s not an outsider. After reading so much information, don’t you think that there’s something missing?” Liu Yun said solemnly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned in thought. He didn’t feel that there was anything missing from the information. All the information on the staff and experts had been available.</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhou Wen didn’t understand him, Liu Yun said, “Don’t you think it’s missing the information of the people who organized the expedition team?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he thought about the information he had read before saying, “Why? Isn’t there information on those officers and soldiers?”</p>
<p>“Are those officers and soldiers qualified to organize such an expedition team? They are only responsible for security,” Liu Yun asked.</p>
<p>“Think about it. For such an important expedition, they invited so many top experts, but they only used the power of some low-ranking officers to protect them. Don’t you think that there’s something wrong if there’s no one monitoring the progress of the work?” Liu Yun continued.</p>
<p>“Are you saying that the Federation deliberately concealed some information? That elder is one of them?” Zhou Wen asked Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“Actually, I’ve investigated this matter before. I even entered the department that initiated the expedition and read through their information. However, the information was done perfectly. I couldn’t see any problems at all. However, I looked at some other information and realized that a few people in that department had mysteriously vanished when the expedition team was established. They never appeared again. Later, I did a lot of investigations, so I’m certain that those people must have gone to Zhuolu.” Liu Yun paused and said, “That old man’s name is Xie Yukun. He’s one of them.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter866'>Chapter 866: Ancient Mirror</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Where did you find him?” Zhou Wen sized up Liu Yun. He was somewhat puzzled as to why Liu Yun was so concerned about this matter.</p>
<p>“It’s quite a coincidence. I originally came here to wait for you. I guessed that after you obtained the Earth Elemental Beast, you would most likely come to the Founding Emperor Tomb. To my surprise, I didn’t see you despite waiting for ages. Instead, I recognized Xie Yukun who was selling things at the market. Therefore, I secretly followed and monitored him, but he discovered me.”</p>
<p>Liu Yun paused for a moment before continuing, “But who am I? He was naturally not my match. In order to save his life, this old fellow told me some things. Only then did I know that he had indeed gone to Zhuolu back then and had been in charge of supervising the expedition team with a few others. However, later on, the others vanished with the expedition team. And he said that he escaped calamity because he was sick and returned to the encampment that day. I naturally don’t believe him.”</p>
<p>“And then?” Zhou Wen increasingly found the matter odd.</p>
<p>He felt that the old man was most likely Jing Daoxian, but Liu Yun said that he was Xie Yukun and was related to the Zhuolu expedition team. This was somewhat odd.</p>
<p>“Then, he rattled on about some nonsense, saying that there’s something good in the Founding Emperor Tomb. Furthermore, he has a way to enter. I felt that he knew a lot about the Founding Emperor Tomb. Furthermore, I’m very curious as to why he’s in such a rush to enter the Founding Emperor Tomb. Therefore, I agreed to cooperate with him and temporarily keep him at bay while waiting for you to come,” Liu Yun said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sized up Liu Yun for a while before asking, “Why are you interested in the expedition team?”</p>
<p>“Ahem, of course it’s because I’m concerned about you, Junior Brother. I know you’re very concerned about this matter, so I helped you investigate it.” Liu Yun changed the topic and said, “If you don’t believe me, we’ll capture that Xie Yukun later and torture him personally. Then you’ll know if I lied to you.”</p>
<p>“Me? Beat him? I’m afraid that the two of us will be the ones getting crippled later,” Zhou Wen said with a twitch of his lips.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. Although that old man has some ability, he’s far from our match. I can deal with him alone,” Liu Yun said smugly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that Liu Yun didn’t seem to be faking it, so he said to him, “I don’t know why you’re interested in this matter, but I don’t know if that old man is Xie Yukun. I just feel that he’s someone else.”</p>
<p>“Who?” Liu Yun hurriedly asked when he saw Zhou Wen’s solemn expression.</p>
<p>“Jing Daoxian,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s expression changed when he heard that. He said in disbelief, “That’s impossible! How can he be Jing Daoxian?”</p>
<p>“In any case, I won’t be going to the Founding Emperor Tomb. Watch your back,” Zhou Wen said as he prepared to leave. However, when he walked past Liu Yun and looked ahead, his expression changed.</p>
<p>At some point in time, the old man had arrived and was now standing in front of them. He smiled at the two of them as cold sweat immediately broke out on Zhou Wen’s back.</p>
<p>Liu Yun wanted to stop Zhou Wen, but when he turned his head and saw the old man, his expression changed.</p>
<p>“Old Man Xie, when did you come?” Liu Yun also knew that something was amiss. Xie Yukun had appeared so close to them, but he hadn’t sensed anything.</p>
<p>The old man ignored him and smiled at Zhou Wen. “I never expected you to recognize me. It’s somewhat unexpected.”</p>
<p>“It’s difficult not to recognize a figure like you,” Zhou Wen said to Jing Daoxian. The old man had clearly admitted that he was Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian declined to comment. “Since you are interested in the Founding Emperor Tomb, why don’t you enter with us? You should know that even if I were to kill everyone in this world, I won’t be willing to let you die. There’s no need for you to be wary of me.”</p>
<p>“Are… Are you really Jing Daoxian?” Liu Yun widened his eyes as he looked at Jing Daoxian in disbelief.</p>
<p>The number one devil in the Federation. He had actually beaten the number one devil in the Federation previously and lived to talk about it. Even Liu Yun felt his legs go limp.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, you were also waiting for me?” Zhou Wen stared at Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>“I originally planned on taking the Earth Elemental Beast after the Zhang family auctioned it off. However, since you took the Earth Elemental Beast, I naturally wouldn’t take it from you. I could only wait for you here,” Jing Daoxian said.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but I’m not interested in the Founding Emperor Tomb. I’m leaving. Since you and my Eldest Senior Brother are so interested in it, it’s best you go together,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s face turned livid as he forced a smile. “I’m not interested either. I was just fooling around. Old Master, don’t take it to heart.”</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian’s expression remained unchanged as he sighed. “It doesn’t matter if the two of you aren’t going, but now, one of you has the Earth Elemental Beast and the other has the Emperor Qin Sword. These two items are necessary to enter the Founding Emperor Tomb. Therefore, no matter what, I will need the two of you to accompany me.”</p>
<p>“What if I say no?” Zhou Wen was already prepared to fight or escape.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian said with a smile, “You don’t have to be so nervous. I’ve said it before. Even if everyone in the world dies, I’ll ensure your survival. Therefore, you don’t have to treat me as an enemy. However, you have to accompany me on this trip to the Founding Emperor Tomb. I’m just too old and my body is too weak. I need external help to continue living.”</p>
<p>“That’s your problem. What has it got to do with me?” Zhou Wen retreated as he spoke. Although Jing Daoxian treated him as an experimental subject and the chances of him killing him weren’t high, who knew what kind of scheme Jing Daoxian would come up with? It was best to stay away from him if possible.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen Lord Alcohol and Xia Jiuhuang’s outcome with his own eyes. The two of them were also Jing Daoxian’s test subjects. There was no doubt about that.</p>
<p>“Since Zhou Wen isn’t going, It’s useless even if I go. I’ll leave this sword for you. I’ll be leaving now. If you have anything to say, have a good chat with my junior brother.” Liu Yun placed the ancient sword on the ground as he retreated.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian didn’t stop them. He slowly took out something. It was an ancient bronze mirror. The mirror’s surface was blurry, and its reflections were also blurry.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw the ancient mirror, he felt that something was amiss. He summoned the Earth Elemental Beast and attempted to escape.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s speed wasn’t slow either. Like a meteor, he quickly rushed into the forest.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian had no intention of stopping them. He held the ancient mirror and slowly turned it. Then, a strange scene happened. Zhou Wen, who had already escaped through the ground, and Liu Yun, who had rushed into the forest, returned as though things were being played back.</p>
<p>“Follow me!” Jing Daoxian carried the ancient mirror as he walked. Zhou Wen and Liu Yun couldn’t control their bodies as they were pulled towards the Founding Emperor Tomb like puppets.</p>
<h3 id='chapter867'>Chapter 867: Yin Yang Mirror</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen felt as though his body was uncontrollable as he followed Jing Daoxian in the direction of the Founding Emperor Tomb.</p>
<p>His various bodily functions seemed normal. He could also use his various abilities, but for some reason, he couldn’t help but follow Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t counterattack blindly. He used Truth Listener to observe the ancient mirror in Jing Daoxian’s arms and realized that he and Liu Yun’s shadows were inside.</p>
<p>The problem was that Jing Daoxian’s back was facing them. It was impossible for the ancient mirror to directly reflect them. Why were their shadows inside?</p>
<p>Liu Yun was also led away. He gathered strength in his hand, but after some hesitation, he didn’t dare attack Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>Although Jing Daoxian had his back facing them and didn’t seem to be on guard, he was Jing Daoxian. Even Liu Yun had to consider the consequences of attacking.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t take action. Instead, he secretly circulated his Essence Energy Art and switched his Life Souls to see if he could escape the ancient mirror’s control.</p>
<p>If he couldn’t escape the ancient mirror’s control, he would be limited in every aspect if he really were to fight Jing Daoxian. It was almost impossible for him to gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>Truth Listener’s Evil Nullification ability didn’t have any effect. The ancient mirror’s ability clearly didn’t belong to an evil power like a curse. Switching to the Dao Sutra, the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder that had the ability to break taboos failed to free Zhou Wen from the ancient mirror’s control.</p>
<p>It’s not a curse or a taboo power. What kind of power is the ancient mirror? Zhou Wen suddenly realized a problem.</p>
<p>Ya’er was in his arms, but there was no sign of her in the ancient mirror.</p>
<p>Why is Ya’er’s shadow missing? Is it because Jing Daoxian didn’t attack Ya’er, or is Ya’er special? Is that ancient mirror useless against her? If it’s because Ya’er is special, what’s special about her? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that the biggest difference between Ya’er and him was that Ya’er had already died once and couldn’t be considered a real living person.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought again and switched his Essence Energy Art to Small Perfection of Wisdom. He wanted to see if he could use Supreme Hell King to escape the ancient mirror’s control, but it was useless.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen switched to Supreme Hell King, he was stunned when he saw Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>He rubbed his eyes in disbelief and carefully looked at Jing Daoxian’s body. However, the outcome was the same. He couldn’t see any sinflames on Jing Daoxian’s body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen many humans, but he had never seen anyone without sinflames. At most, it was a matter of how many sinflames they had.</p>
<p>However, Jing Daoxian didn’t have any flames on him. He was unbelievably clean.</p>
<p>That’s impossible… The more evil a person does, the more sinflames they have. Jing Daoxian is the number one devil in the Federation. He has committed countless crimes and killed countless people. How can he not have any sinflames? Ignoring the fact that he’s the number one devil in the Federation, even an ordinary person who hasn’t done any evil in his entire life wouldn’t be without sinflames… Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that Jing Daoxian must have used some special method to extinguish the sinflames on him. However, he didn’t know how he had done it.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Since the Supreme Hell King’s powers were useless, Zhou Wen had to think of other methods. He switched several Essence Energy Arts, but he was unable to break the influence the ancient mirror had on him.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was clearly making various attempts, but like Zhou Wen, he didn’t have any good results.</p>
<p>When they arrived in front of the Founding Emperor Tomb, the two of them were still unable to escape the ancient mirror’s control.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian stopped and waved the ancient mirror in front of the two of them. The two of them immediately regained their freedom. Jing Daoxian said with a smile, “This ancient mirror is called the Yin Yang Mirror. You might not have heard of it, but in ancient times, this Yin Yang Mirror once left all the gods in the world in awe. It can wipe out souls and kill people. I only used it to lock up one of your souls. If you follow me into the Founding Emperor Tomb, I’ll naturally release the soul trapped in the Yin Yang Mirror. Of course, you can choose not to go. However, this soul will always be locked in the Yin Yang Mirror. Over time, it will probably dissipate.”</p>
<p>“What will happen to someone without a soul?” Liu Yun asked.</p>
<p>“To put it simply, the Yin Yang Mirror divides a person’s soul into three souls and seven senses. Losing a soul isn’t a big deal. You’ll still have two souls and seven senses. Your bodies aren’t damaged, so it won’t kill you. At most, your memory will worsen. Over time, you might become an idiot,” Jing Daoxian said with a smile.</p>
<p>Liu Yun and Zhou Wen exchanged looks. Zhou Wen knew that Jing Daoxian wasn’t being an alarmist. The shadows in the ancient mirror weren’t born out of thin air. They had some connection to their bodies.</p>
<p>Liu Yun suddenly thought of something. He stared at the Yin Yang Mirror and said, “Could it be that the ancient mirror is the legendary Yin Yang Mirror, the supreme treasure in the battle between the gods during the Shang and Zhou dynasty period?”</p>
<p>“You are quite knowledgeable, but it’s not considered a supreme treasure. It’s just a manifestation of a Mythical Companion Beast. However, it’s slightly stronger than ordinary Mythical creatures,” Jing Daoxian said.</p>
<p>“A Terror-grade Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen stared at the Yin Yang Mirror.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian narrowed his eyes. “To think that you already know about the Terror-grade. That’s right. The Yin Yang Mirror is indeed at the Terror-grade. If I wanted to kill you, it’s just a matter of thinking about it. Therefore, you don’t have to worry about me killing you. This is because I can kill you anytime I want. There’s no need to trick you into entering the Founding Emperor Tomb. As long as you help me enter it to retrieve something, you can regain your freedom. Furthermore, I’ll only take one item from the Founding Emperor Tomb. The rest will be yours.”</p>
<p>“You have the strength, so it’s naturally up to you,” Liu Yun said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as a tacit agreement.</p>
<p>However, he thought to himself, Since the Yin Yang Mirror Companion Beast can advance to the Terror grade, Companion Beasts like Torch Dragon with the Evolvable attribute should be able to advance to the Terror grade. How can I advance them?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen remembered that The Thearch had said that only those at the Terror grade could defeat the Terror grade. Although he had many pets, none of them were at the Terror grade. It was probably not easy to defeat the Yin Yang Mirror.</p>
<p>It’s too late to think of a way to advance to the Terror grade. Is there a way to bypass the Yin Yang Mirror and kill Jing Daoxian? Zhou Wen felt that he might have a chance.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian had been severely injured. Furthermore, he had said that his body wasn’t in good condition. Without external help, he probably wouldn’t live long.</p>
<p>“Summon your Earth Elemental Beast and let it take us into the Founding Emperor Tomb. You have to use Earth Escape according to the coordinates I mentioned. It has to be precise, nothing more, nothing less. Otherwise, the three of us will die inside. No one will be spared,” Jing Daoxian said.</p>
<h3 id='chapter868'>Chapter 868: Underground Imperial City</h3>
<p>He needed to deal Jing Daoxian a fatal strike and not give him a chance to counterattack; otherwise, Zhou Wen wouldn’t be able to withstand the Terror-grade Yin Yang Mirror.</p>
<p>Without full confidence, Zhou Wen could only feign civility and listen to Jing Daoxian’s instructions.</p>
<p>The three of them sat on the Earth Elemental Beast’s back. Zhou Wen controlled the Earth Elemental Beast and used the coordinates Jing Daoxian had mentioned to let it drill into the Founding Emperor Tomb.</p>
<p>The Earth Elemental Beast phased away with the trio and burrowed into the ground. When Zhou Wen’s vision recovered, he realized that the Earth Elemental Beast’s body had landed atop a huge stone pillar.</p>
<p>The stone pillar was more than four meters in diameter and more than thirty meters tall. Beneath the stone pillar, there was silver liquid flowing slowly.</p>
<p>In the huge underground world, there was a huge stone pillar every few hundred meters. However, the stone pillars were connected to the stone ceiling. Only the stone pillar they were standing on was halved.</p>
<p>In the entire underground world, other than the stone pillar, there was only silver liquid. If the Earth Elemental Beast’s Earth Escape had deviated slightly, they would have fallen into the silver liquid.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen and Liu Yun look at the silver liquid below, Jing Daoxian said, “That liquid is mercury. It’s very poisonous to humans, but this mercury shouldn’t be much considering our physiques. It can’t harm our bodies. However, after the dimensionalization, there’s a now terrifying dimensional creature in the mercury. If we fall into the mercury, even I might not be able to come out alive.”</p>
<p>“What dimensional creature is that?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“See for yourself,” said Jing Daoxian. He summoned a mouse-like beast and let it fall into the mercury.</p>
<p>The little beast bobbed up and down over the silver liquid’s surface twice. The surrounding mercury suddenly gathered towards the little beast, turning into a strange creature that looked like a snake with wings on its back. It swallowed the little beast in one mouthful.</p>
<p>When the little beast touched its saliva, its body immediately festered as though it had melted.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Liu Yun were alarmed when they saw the instant devouring of the tiny beast. The mercury-like monster’s aura was extremely shocking. It was definitely at the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to worry too much. As long as you don’t touch the mercury, you won’t alarm it.” As Jing Daoxian spoke, he summoned a bird and sat on its back before flying deep into the underground world.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen unsummoned the Earth Elemental Beast and summoned a flying mount just like Liu Yun did. They flew deep into the underground world with Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>“Legend has it that the Founding Emperor Tomb is extremely dangerous. From the looks of it, it’s nothing much.” Liu Yun looked around but didn’t find anything dangerous.</p>
<p>“We haven’t even entered the Founding Emperor Tomb’s main entrance,” Jing Daoxian said indifferently.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept using Truth Listener to scan the area in front of him. He could already see a huge metal door at the end of the Mercury Sea. In the middle of the metal door was a flat opening that looked like it would fit an ancient sword.</p>
<p>Soon, the three of them arrived at the door. Jing Daoxian pointed at the gap and said, “Insert the Emperor Qin Sword in. After opening this door, we will truly enter the Founding Emperor Tomb.”</p>
<p>Liu Yun was somewhat hesitant, but his life was still in Jing Daoxian’s hands. He had no choice but to walk over with the Emperor Qin Sword. After ensuring that he was 100% protected, he carefully inserted the Emperor Qin Sword.</p>
<p>When the Emperor Qin Sword was completely inserted, the three of them heard a cracking sound.</p>
<p>Liu Yun flew back like lightning, but the door slowly opened, revealing the scene behind it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but feel shocked when he saw the scene inside. Behind the door was a huge ancient city. There was a stretch of ancient palace complexes in the ancient city, and there were many bronze men with weapons standing on both sides of the street. There were even a few bronze carriage statues standing in the middle of the street.</p>
<p>At the end of the long street, there were twelve golden men sitting in front of the majestic temple-like palace. Each golden man was thirty feet tall when sitting, as though they were golden divine generals guarding the palace.</p>
<p>Whoosh!</p>
<p>The moment the trio stepped through the door, the bronze men on the long street raised their weapons and looked at Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>These bronze men were very similar to the Bronze Men at the periphery of the mausoleum. However, the Bronze Men at the periphery of the mausoleum were typically bare-handed and did not carry any weapons. As for the bronze men here, each of them held a spear or sword.</p>
<p>With the sound of the bronze swords being unsheathed, groups of bronze men charged at Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>“Leave the mere bronze men to me.” Liu Yun took the initiative to charge forward.</p>
<p>Bronze Men Companion Eggs were rare to begin with, and these bronze men had weapons. If a few Companion Beasts dropped, their value would definitely be rather high.</p>
<p>However, after Liu Yun rushed in, he realized that the bronze men were like warriors who had been battle-hardened. They advanced in rows and formed a battle formation, constantly attacking the encircled Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Liu Yun’s movement technique was extremely powerful. His fast hands flashed repeatedly as he snatched the white blades with his bare hands, snatching all the weapons from the bronze men nearby.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>A bronze man was beheaded by Liu Yun with a bronze sword. Liu Yun charged all the way as though he had entered a no man’s zone. Be it his movement techniques or offensive techniques, they were all excellent. Even an army of thousands seemed unable to trap him.</p>
<p>After killing dozens of bronze men, a Companion Egg dropped.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s was really fast. Before the Companion Egg landed, he had grabbed it.</p>
<p>Just as Liu Yun was about to kill more bronze men, he suddenly saw one of the golden men stand up. The golden man, who was thirty feet tall when sitting, looked even more majestic when he stood up.</p>
<p>The golden man stepped on the stone steps and walked down the long street. His speed became faster and faster. After a few steps, he was like a charging lion. When he was a hundred meters away from Liu Yun, he leaped up and struck down at him.</p>
<p>Liu Yun didn’t hesitate either. He summoned his Companion Beast and transformed it into a bracer that wrapped around his fist and arm. Then, without retreating at all, he clashed with the golden man’s huge fist.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>When the two fists collided, Liu Yun immediately flew back and fell to the ground. He rolled far away and slammed into the city wall behind him before stopping.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother… That’s the end of the road for me… I’ll leave the rest to you… You have to get out alive…” Liu Yun struggled a few times but failed to get up. Blood kept flowing out of his mouth. Just as he finished speaking, he fell to the ground. There was no heartbeat or breathing. It looked like he was dead.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian grabbed the Emperor Qin Sword and stabbed it into his thigh. Liu Yun remained motionless; there was no reaction from his muscles.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, he’s really dead. Don’t waste a perfectly good body. Dig out his heart and use it for food.” As Jing Daoxian spoke, he was about to stab Liu Yun’s chest.</p>
<p>“Cough, cough… I… I can still be saved…” Liu Yun suddenly sat up again. His heartbeat and breathing were back as he laughed dryly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter869'>Chapter 869: Twelve Gold Men</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Zhou Wen, I’ll leave this to you,” Jing Daoxian said as he pointed at the golden man walking over.</p>
<p>“Isn’t your Yin Yang Mirror very powerful? Can’t you just use it? Why go through so much trouble?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, the Yin Yang Mirror is only useful against lifeforms with flesh and blood. It’s not very useful against such Gold Men.” Jing Daoxian didn’t seem to have any qualms as he revealed the Yin Yang Mirror’s weakness.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if what he said was true, but he could only summon Tyrant Behemoth and let it fight the Gold Man.</p>
<p>The Gold Man’s strength and defense were very strong. It wasn’t at a disadvantage when fighting Tyrant Behemoth. Zhou Wen had no choice but to get Tyrant Behemoth to activate Absolute Strength to quickly finish off the Gold Man.</p>
<p>Under the suppression of Absolute Strength, the Gold Man was immediately sent retreating by Tyrant Behemoth. Just as he was about to withstand heavy damage after failing to put up a defense, another Gold Man rushed down and joined the battle.</p>
<p>With the addition of this Gold Man, the first Gold Man became much stronger. However, it was still no match for Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>The Gold Men came down one after another. They attacked Tyrant Behemoth together, and their cooperation was almost flawless.</p>
<p>Not good! Zhou Wen saw the problem. The twelve Gold Men were similar to the nine black dragons in the underground sea. They could share each other’s powers.</p>
<p>After seven Gold Men joined the battle, their strength was already on par with Tyrant Behemoth, who had activated Absolute Strength. It was difficult for Tyrant Behemoth to gain an advantage.</p>
<p>“Tyrant Behemoth is about to be overwhelmed. You should do something, right?” Zhou Wen said to Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian smiled and said, “All you need to do is lure the twelve Gold Men in front of the palace down. I’ll enter the temple to take something and we’ll leave immediately. It won’t take long.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that Jing Daoxian had ulterior motives for bringing him to the Founding Emperor Tomb. It wasn’t as simple as borrowing the Earth Elemental Beast.</p>
<p>More and more Gold Men came down the stairs. When ten Gold Men besieged Tyrant Behemoth, Tyrant Behemoth was already in a losing position. It looked like it couldn’t hold on much longer.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid that Tyrant Behemoth won’t be able to last until all twelve of the Gold Men are down before it’s killed. It’s best you make plans early.” Zhou Wen was telling the truth. Although Tyrant Behemoth was powerful, it was still impossible for it to fight twelve alone.</p>
<p>The strength and physique of these Gold Men were very strong to begin with. Furthermore, they could borrow each other’s strength. Even Tyrant Behemoth with Absolute Strength was about to be defeated.</p>
<p>“Forget it. I’ll settle the remaining two myself,” Jing Daoxian said as he charged towards the palace guarded by the twelve Gold Men.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw him rush over the battlefield like a strange bird with the Yin Yang Mirror in hand. He wanted to rush into the palace.</p>
<p>The two Gold Men who had yet to come down immediately realized Jing Daoxian’s intentions. They stood in front of the palace door and threw punches at him.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian’s body was in midair as a ring on his finger spun. Then, Zhou Wen saw his figure vanish. When he appeared again, he was already in front of the palace door.</p>
<p>Teleportation ability. Could it be that the Essence Energy Art Jing Daoxian cultivates in is spatial? As Zhou Wen guessed, Jing Daoxian had already slammed into the palace door.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the palace door was clearly closed, but when Jing Daoxian slammed into it, he seemed to be able to penetrate the wall. The door failed to stop him at all.</p>
<p>The fists of the two Gold Men slammed heavily onto the door, causing it to rumble. However, they failed to move the door at all.</p>
<p>Unable to find Jing Daoxian, the two Gold Men turned around and rushed into the battlefield, joining in the fight against Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth was already having a hard time holding on. With the addition of the two Gold Men, it immediately lost the strength to resist. It received several punches on its body, causing its bones to crack.</p>
<p>“These twelve Gold Men are too powerful. Even Tyrant Behemoth isn’t their match. Let’s retreat now.” Liu Yun retreated as he spoke, but when he arrived at the city gates, he was blocked by a strange force. He couldn’t leave no matter what.</p>
<p>Liu Yun gathered his strength and struck again and again, but he still couldn’t charge out.</p>
<p>“There’s no need for you to try. I’ve already gotten the Earth Elemental Beast to try. It can’t even escape with Earth Escape.” Zhou Wen had already tried. If he could escape, he wouldn’t have let Tyrant Behemoth withstand the twelve Gold Men’s attacks.</p>
<p>“Jing Daoxian rushed into the palace to take the treasures, but he made us wait here for death. He’s clearly trying to scam us,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“That might not be the case. Although the twelve Gold Men are powerful with extremely powerful Strength and Constitution, they aren’t fast. As long as we don’t fight them head-on, it won’t be easy for them to kill us in a short period of time. The problem now is how do we enter the palace? We can’t really just wait for Jing Daoxian to come out, right?” Zhou Wen said as he unsummoned Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Having lost their important target, Tyrant Behemoth, the twelve Gold Men immediately charged at Zhou Wen and Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wait for them to come over as he started using his movement technique and charged towards the twelve Gold Men.</p>
<p>He had been watching from the side for a while and had a general understanding of the abilities of the twelve Gold Men. Although it wasn’t easy to kill them, it wasn’t difficult to stay alive.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Transcendent Flying Immortal and constantly shuttled through the twelve Gold Men. Although the twelve Gold Men were powerful, they appeared somewhat clumsy and failed to touch Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Liu Yun also quickly dodged the twelve Gold Men’s attacks. He was also good at movement techniques and wasn’t much weaker than Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“When the two Gold Men smashed their fists into the palace door, they failed to budge it at all. I’m afraid that the door can’t be opened with brute force. Otherwise, Jing Daoxian wouldn’t have needed to pass through the wall. We don’t know how to pass through walls, so it won’t be easy to enter,” Liu Yun said as he dodged.</p>
<p>“You have to give it a try even if it’s not easy. Aren’t you the best thief in the world? Can’t a thief like you even open a door?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“It’s not difficult to open the door, but it needs time. We are now being chased by these twelve Gold Men. There’s no way out. How do I have the time to open the door?” Liu Yun said gloomily.</p>
<p>“I’ll hold them back. Take the opportunity to open the door,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“How are you going to hold them back? Even Tyrant Behemoth couldn’t withstand it. Do you have any stronger Companion Beasts?” Liu Yun asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“I don’t have any stronger Companion Beasts, but if I want to hold them back, I don’t need powerful Companion Beasts. I just need to tank the beating,” Zhou Wen said as he summoned a Companion Beast.</p>
<h3 id='chapter870'>Chapter 870: Tiger General’s Might</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Liu Yun took a careful look and realized that he recognized the Companion Beast Zhou Wen had summoned.</p>
<p>Not only did he know it, but he had once owned it. Later, he took the initiative to return it to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“No way? You want to use it to block the twelve Gold Men? Are you crazy?” Liu Yun had once stolen the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General from Zhou Wen. He had some understanding of the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General and knew that it was an Epic Companion Beast.</p>
<p>It was impossible for Zhou Wen to use the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to fight the twelve Gold Men.</p>
<p>“I’ll give it a try. Perhaps it will work?” Zhou Wen carried Ya’er and constantly moved around the city, dodging the Gold Men’s attacks.</p>
<p>The strongest thing about the twelve Gold Men wasn’t their strength, but their defense. Even Tyrant Behemoth, who had Absolute Strength, wasn’t able to leave a fatal wound on them. It was obvious how powerful their bodies were.</p>
<p>The moment the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General appeared, he was surrounded by the Bronze Men on the street. However, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General didn’t care about that. The tiger beneath him charged at the Bronze Men crazily. The spear in his hand instantly pierced through the three Bronze Men like a skewer of candied haws. He lifted them up and threw them out, tearing them apart in midair.</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was like a tiger that had entered a flock of sheep. The Bronze Men with astonishing defense had no chance of turning the tide under its spear. In just a moment, he had killed twenty to thirty Bronze Men.</p>
<p>A Gold Man charged at the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General and threw a huge metal fist at him.</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General showed no signs of weakness. The spear in his hand stabbed out with the momentum of an armor-piercing spear, colliding with the Gold Man’s fist.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General remained motionless, but the Gold Man was forced to take a few steps back.</p>
<p>In a one-on-one situation, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s Strength was stronger than the Gold Man, but he wasn’t much stronger.</p>
<p>That’s impossible!? Liu Yun’s eyes nearly popped out. When he stole the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, he didn’t find the latter that strong.</p>
<p>After the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General landed on the ground, it continued charging through the Bronze Men. Its body gradually burned with strange purple flames.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s skill combination that resembled a perpetual motion machine was beginning to take effect.</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was a Companion Beast that became stronger as he fought. He could condense killing aura to strengthen himself. The flames that were ignited by killing aura were transformed by the Tempered Steel Cauldron skill, making his body stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>As long as the twelve Gold Men failed to kill him in the beginning, he would become stronger and stronger. Perhaps when he reached a certain level of strength, he could fight the twelve Gold Men.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s body could be strengthened to that level. He could give it a try now.</p>
<p>As the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General unleashed his might, more and more Gold Men were attracted to it. The pressure on Zhou Wen and Liu Yun decreased significantly.</p>
<p>As for Liu Yun, he wore a look of disbelief. He really couldn’t believe that the Companion Beast he had stolen and returned to Zhou Wen was so powerful.</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was fighting against five Gold Men alone, and in such a spectacular manner without being at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>If I had known that this thing was so powerful, I wouldn’t have returned him to Zhou Wen! Liu Yun felt his heart bleed.</p>
<p>“Let me give him a boost.” Zhou Wen summoned three Fire Furnace Queens and got them to release a large amount of flames at the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>Two of the other Fire Furnace Queens were obtained by Zhou Wen later. Now, there were only three of them.</p>
<p>With the augmentation of the flames, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General became even more ferocious. The purple flames on the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General became more and more intense. It was like a Fiend Tiger and Fiend General that had rushed out of hell.</p>
<p>Seven or eight Gold Men surrounded it and temporarily suppressed the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s ferocious might. However, under their pressure, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General became stronger the more it fought. It had no intention of retreating.</p>
<p>Soon, all twelve Gold Men were attracted by it.</p>
<p>No way! This fellow is even more ferocious than Tyrant Behemoth? Liu Yun felt as though someone had stabbed him in the heart a few times. He had stolen such a ferocious Companion Beast and ended up returning it to Zhou Wen. However, when he thought of this matter, he had the urge to bang his head against the wall or slap himself.</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General staggered under the siege of the twelve Gold Men. However, it continued to brandish the spear in its hand to fight them. The ferocious tiger beneath it roared and pounced forward.</p>
<p>Although it looked a little tragic, even Tyrant Behemoth couldn’t restrain the twelve Gold Men.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the sparks fly off the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s body, Zhou Wen wasn’t alarmed. Instead, he was delighted and began to feel relieved.</p>
<p>If the twelve Gold Men had attacked together from the beginning, perhaps only eight or nine Gold Men would have been needed to kill Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>However, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s skills had already formed a cycle. He became stronger and stronger in battle. It was already impossible for the twelve Gold Men to kill him.</p>
<p>As long as the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s body could withstand it, he might eventually become stronger than the twelve Gold Men.</p>
<p>“Why are you still watching? Open the door,” Zhou Wen said to Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Only then did Liu Yun snap out of his daze. He looked at the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General with a pained expression before turning to run to the palace door to open it.</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General stormed through the city, attracting the attention of the twelve Gold Men. They had no time to care about Zhou Wen and Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Some Bronze Men rushed over, but Zhou Wen casually killed them, preventing them from approaching Liu Yun who was opening the door.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept using Truth Listener to scan the palace, but the palace was enveloped by a strange force that Truth Listener’s power couldn’t penetrate.</p>
<p>Unless Zhou Wen got Truth Listener to break its earrings, it would be very difficult for it to make a breakthrough.</p>
<p>“It’s open!” After a while, Liu Yun, who was sprawled in front of the door, shouted happily. Then, he pushed the door with both hands, and the palace door opened.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen focused his gaze inside, but what he saw left him and Liu Yun stunned.</p>
<p>He originally imagined that Jing Daoxian was plundering the palace, but the situation was completely different. Jing Daoxian stood inside the door, holding the Yin Yang Mirror with both hands. His body was covered in sweat as though he had just been fished out of water.</p>
<p>The Yin Yang Mirror emitted divine light. And in the hall opposite the Yin Yang Mirror, there was a five-foot-long sword hanging.</p>
<p>The divine light emitted by the sword collided with the Yin Yang Mirror’s divine light. It was not at all inferior. It even seemed to be suppressing the Yin Yang Mirror.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, what sword is that? It can actually suppress the Yin Yang Mirror?” Liu Yun was alarmed. He didn’t dare enter the palace and only sized up the sword from the outside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also sizing up the sword. The Yin Yang Mirror was already a Companion Beast at the Terror grade. For the sword to be able to suppress it, it was clearly extraordinary.</p>
<p>The ancient sword was simple and unadorned. It was actually a stone sword. Although it didn’t look eye-catching and there weren’t any beautiful gems embedded on the sword or scabbard, the sword beam it emitted left one shuddering in fear.</p>
<h3 id='chapter871'>Chapter 871: Art on the Door</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen only glanced at the stone sword before his gaze went past it and landed on the hall behind it.</p>
<p>With the stone sword used as the dividing line, there were only some murals and sculptures in the hall ahead. And in the hall behind the stone sword, there were rows of bamboo slips.</p>
<p>Bamboo slips were tools used in ancient times for records. Back then, before paper was invented, people would engrave words on pieces of bamboo. Then, they would string the bamboo together for easy storage and reading.</p>
<p>Looking in from the outside door, there were rows of shelves in the hall behind. All sorts of bamboo slips were placed on them. The number was shocking. Even the Federation’s library might not have such a large scale.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the main point of Zhou Wen’s observation. The main point was that the bamboo slips seemed to emit a strange power. It was thanks to the power emitted by the bamboo slips that the stone sword could emit such terrifying might, allowing it to withstand the Yin Yang Mirror.</p>
<p>How strange. That stone sword can actually use the power of the bamboo slips. This is unheard of. Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>Books and swords were originally two incompatible things, but now, the sword had borrowed the aura of books. It was very strange.</p>
<p>Liu Yun gave Zhou Wen the nod before looking at Jing Daoxian, who was struggling against the stone sword in the hall.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood Liu Yun’s intentions. He wanted to kick him while he was down. Now, Jing Daoxian was using all his strength to resist the stone sword. This was the best opportunity to kill him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat tempted. If he could kill Jing Daoxian here, he wouldn’t have to be on guard against Jing Daoxian in the future. He was afraid that he would follow in the footsteps of Lord Alcohol and Xia Jiuhuang.</p>
<p>Just as he was considering taking a gamble, the Yin Yang Ancient Mirror in Jing Daoxian’s hand suddenly spun. The divine light on the mirror turned from white to black as it spewed at the stone sword.</p>
<p>With a sword hum, the stone sword unsheathed and transformed into a peerless sword beam that slashed at Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>The Yin Yang Ancient Mirror’s mirror beam was completely unable to withstand the stone sword as it was cleaved apart. The stone sword was about to strike the Yin Yang Ancient Mirror.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Liu Yun were delighted. If the Yin Yang Ancient Mirror could be destroyed, their imprisoned souls would naturally be able to escape.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>At the instant the stone sword was about to slash at the ancient mirror, Jing Daoxian suddenly retracted in his hand. Another item that looked like a jade seal smashed into the stone sword.</p>
<p>The stone sword landed on the ground with a clang and was suppressed by the jade seal. It struggled to flip the jade seal but was close to doing so.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian ignored the jade seal and stone sword as he quickly rushed into the hall behind and vanished in a flash.</p>
<p>Almost at the instant he rushed into the hall where the bamboo slips were piled up, the jade seal was sliced into two by the sword beam on the stone sword and shattered.</p>
<p>The stone sword circled in the air, but it didn’t chase towards the back of the hall. It only returned to the scabbard.</p>
<p>“Damn it. We should have done it earlier,” Liu Yun said regretfully.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen shook his head and said, “It would have been useless. Jing Daoxian only risked his life because he sensed our killing intent towards him. It wouldn’t have mattered if we attack earlier or later.”</p>
<p>“What do we do now? With that stone sword guarding the hall, I’m afraid we won’t have the chance to rush in like Jing Daoxian,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“Since we can’t enter, we can only wait.” Zhou Wen left the door and looked at the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General who was fighting the twelve Gold Men.</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General became braver the more he fought. Although he was still at a disadvantage, he was already able to stand firm under the siege of the twelve Gold Men. It wasn’t as pathetic as before.</p>
<p>Looking at the purple flames that were burning like a furnace in his body, as well as the armor that was burning like an amethyst, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but have a thought.</p>
<p>The Ancient Sovereign Sutra is a battle-type Essence Energy Art. The Defy Ancient Sovereign Life Soul is also the type that grows stronger the more one fights. It’s somewhat similar to the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. Can I use the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s model to advance the Defy Ancient Sovereign Life Soul? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Although the Defy Ancient Sovereign Life Soul doesn’t have the ability to condense killing aura into flames, it comes with a powerful life essence. If I can use the Defy Ancient Sovereign’s life essence to burn myself… Zhou Wen considered this possibility.</p>
<p>However, now wasn’t the time to study this. He took out his phone and opened the downloaded Founding Emperor Tomb dungeon before entering.</p>
<p>There was no entrance to the Founding Emperor Tomb dungeon, but Zhou Wen already knew the way in. He summoned the Earth Elemental Beast in-game and quickly arrived at the pillar in the Mercury Sea.</p>
<p>He easily passed through the Mercury Sea and arrived outside the city. However, he didn’t have the Emperor Qin Sword in-game. All Zhou Wen could do was attempt to use the Earth Elemental Beast to enter the city.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the mysterious city seemed to be protected by some mysterious force, preventing the Earth Elemental Beast from entering.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I can only try using force. Zhou Wen ordered the blood-colored avatar to strike the door, but it was useless. No matter how powerful the attack was, it couldn’t budge the door at all.</p>
<p>Could it be that I really can’t enter without the Emperor Qin Sword? Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to carefully observe the door and the structure of the keyhole, hoping to use the power of a miniature Companion Beast to open it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was no special structure inside the keyhole. It was like a scabbard that was only compatible with the Emperor Qin Sword.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was feeling disappointed, he suddenly realized that there were words on the door.</p>
<p>Strange, why didn’t I see these words before? Puzzled, Zhou Wen looked at the ancient city’s door in real life. He didn’t see any words on the door.</p>
<p>He clearly remembered that those words didn’t exist on the door when the blood-colored avatar first arrived in-game.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the words on the door in-game. They were ancient words from the East District. Zhou Wen had learned some when studying the Dao Sutra, so he recognized the words on the door.</p>
<p>This is an Essence Energy Art? After carefully reading the words on the door, Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>He never expected that there would be an Essence Energy Art on the entrance of the Founding Emperor Tomb. However, this Essence Energy Art came out of nowhere. Zhou Wen didn’t know what Essence Energy Art it was.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was reading the Essence Energy Art on his phone, Liu Yun looked into the hall and then at the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General who was fighting the twelve Gold Men. He was extremely anxious. When he turned his head, he saw Zhou Wen sitting there playing with his phone. He couldn’t help but say, “Junior Brother, you’re still in the mood to play with your phone at such a time? We have to quickly think of a way to enter and see what Jing Daoxian is doing.”</p>
<p>“With that stone sword around, I don’t have the ability to enter. If you have a solution, feel free to give it a try.” After Zhou Wen finished reading the Essence Energy Art on the door, the Lost Immortal Sutra played its role again, simulating the Essence Energy Art.</p>
<h3 id='chapter872'>Chapter 872: Old Man</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>This Essence Energy Art was also strange. There weren’t many changes. It was purely an Energy Refinement technique.</p>
<p>With every circulation of the Essence Energy Art, a portion of the impurities in the Essence Energy would be removed, allowing the Essence Energy to become purer. It was as though it was a technique that specialized in extracting Essence Energy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that by cultivating this Essence Energy Art, he could enter the Founding Emperor Tomb, but he realized that it was useless. After he gained basic mastery of the Essence Energy Art, Zhou Wen used it to push open the door, but the door remained firmly locked. It didn’t open.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed that he couldn’t enter the Founding Emperor Tomb in-game.</p>
<p>He originally wanted to try entering the palace in-game to see if there was a way to pass through the temple guarded by the stone sword, but now, he had to give up.</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General became stronger the more it fought. It was already capable of contending against the twelve Gold Men. He constantly charged back and forth in the ancient city. Most of the Bronze Men had been killed by him, leaving only the twelve Gold Men to fight him. However, there was no way to suppress the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>This fellow’s abilities are really impressive. As long as he has enough time, he’s even stronger than Tyrant Behemoth. Zhou Wen was somewhat gratified, but he was also somewhat worried.</p>
<p>Jinxes Master and Badlands still existed, making Zhou Wen feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, I remember that this Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General should be an Epic Companion Beast, right? Why is it so terrifying?” Liu Yun couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>“Don’t you know that some Companion Beasts can evolve?” Zhou Wen asked casually.</p>
<p>Liu Yun had already guessed it, but when he heard Zhou Wen admit it, he couldn’t help but regret returning the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>There were very few Companion Beasts that could evolve. Typically, only Companion Beasts that hatched from bestowed Companion Eggs obtained from special dimensional zones could have the ability to evolve.</p>
<p>From Liu Yun’s point of view, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was likely such a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>In the intense battle, a Gold Man couldn’t withstand the powerful collision. Cracks appeared on his body as he was beheaded by the Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>The Gold Man’s massive body fell to the ground. Its originally extremely hard body suddenly became as weak as porcelain. It shattered into pieces.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw a dimensional crystal drop from the Gold Man’s remnant body.</p>
<p>After losing a Gold Man, the combat strength of the Gold Men was further weakened. As for the Tiger Soul General, its strength became even stronger. Under this situation, the Tiger Soul General’s might became even more ferocious. The remaining eleven Gold Men were completely suppressed by him.</p>
<p>The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was like a killing machine that didn’t know fatigue on the battlefield. The more it fought, the more ferocious it became. It forced the remaining eleven Gold Men to retreat. Soon, another Gold Man was killed.</p>
<p>As such, the Gold Men’s combat strength was even weaker. The remaining Gold Men were killed by the Tiger Soul General. When the last Gold Man collapsed, there were no longer any living dimensional creatures in the ancient city.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen went down to clean up the battlefield and pick up the Companion Eggs and dimensional crystals that had dropped from the Bronze and Gold Men.</p>
<p>The twelve Gold Men only dropped one dimensional crystal, but it was an Essence Energy Skill Crystal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen secretly used his phone to take a look and realized that the requirement for the Gold Man Essence Energy Skill Crystal was relatively simple. It required 41 Essence Energy and 41 Constitution, without any special stat requirements.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen only had 41 Essence Energy, so he couldn’t absorb and refine it. All he could do was put it away.</p>
<p>Without an opponent, the flames on the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s body gradually dissipated. The fire in its body also slowly extinguished as its strength rapidly dissipated.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t order the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to rush into the palace. Although he was powerful, he hadn’t advanced to the Terror grade. He would probably suffer greatly if he fought the stone sword.</p>
<p>“Could it be that we can only wait here for Jing Daoxian to return?” Liu Yun was very indignant, but there was nothing he could do.</p>
<p>He had already attempted to summon a few Epic creatures to rush into the palace, but the moment they entered, they were instantly killed by the sword beam emitted by the stone sword. The stone sword didn’t even leave its scabbard.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had also looked at the stone sword, but his gaze was mainly focused on the bamboo slips.</p>
<p>Although the stone sword is powerful, its energy source seems to be from the bamboo slips. If I can destroy the bamboo slips, the stone sword’s strength might be greatly weakened, making it possible to rush over, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the bamboo slips were in the hall behind the stone sword. To touch the bamboo slips, one had to pass the stone sword. It was not an easy task to get rid of the bamboo slips.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and summoned the tiny Blood Threadworm Companion Beasts. He got them to crawl into the palace to see if they could escape the stone sword’s protection and crawl into the hall to destroy the bamboo slips.</p>
<p>However, just as the Blood Threadworms entered the palace, they were killed by the sword beam emitted by the stone sword.</p>
<p>Not even a miniature Companion Beast works? Zhou Wen frowned slightly.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Zhou Wen didn’t have any other solutions, but those solutions needed him to enter the temple himself to know if they were useful.</p>
<p>He wasn’t willing to take the risk. A stone sword that could use Terror transformation was too dangerous for him.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Liu Yun suddenly pointed into the ancient city and shouted in horror.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned his head and saw a pillar of light shoot out from the city. It reached the stone dome of the underground world, illuminating the entire underground tomb.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned inwardly. Just as he was about to use Truth Listener to scan the pillar of light, he saw a figure walk out.</p>
<p>Human? That’s not right. Guardian? That’s not right either. Zhou Wen looked at the figure in surprise.</p>
<p>The figure looked like a human. His appearance and clothes were very similar to a human’s, but his aura had the aura of a Guardian.</p>
<p>Could it be… Zhou Wen thought of Wang Mingyuan. The creature in front of him looked like a fusion of a human and a Guardian.</p>
<p>However, he was somewhat different from Wang Mingyuan. Wang Mingyuan had absorbed and fused with a Guardian, but Wang Mingyuan’s will was still dominant.</p>
<p>As for the creature in front of him, it made him feel that it was closer to a Guardian.</p>
<p>Liu Yun also looked warily at the creature who walked through the air step by step. The ancient clothes on his wide sleeves and robe fluttered despite a non-existent wind.</p>
<p>When he got close, Zhou Wen and Liu Yun saw his appearance clearly. It was an old man with white hair and beard. He was wearing ancient traditional clothes.</p>
<p>The only difference between this elder and a normal human was his skin. It had jade-like skin that was crystalline and transparent.</p>
<p>Seeing the elder walk towards the palace door, Zhou Wen and Liu Yun retreated.</p>
<p>The elder ignored them as though he hadn’t seen them and walked straight though the palace door.</p>
<h3 id='chapter873'>Chapter 873: Purple Bronze Pill Furnace</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>As soon as the elder entered the hall, the stone sword immediately emitted a terrifying sword beam that wanted to kill the elder on the spot.</p>
<p>The elder looked at the stone sword’s sword beam as his body underwent an earth-shattering change. His flesh, blood, skin, and clothes instantly took on the form of jade. It was as though his entire body had turned into a strange jade statue.</p>
<p>The sword beam struck the elder’s jade-like body, but it was shattered by a single wave of his hand.</p>
<p>Terror transformation! Zhou Wen was alarmed. The elder could shatter the stone sword’s sword beam. It clearly meant that he was a Terror grade expert.</p>
<p>The stone sword unsheathed itself without any hesitation and slashed at the elder with an invisible sword beam.</p>
<p>The jade-like elder suddenly extended his hands to grab the stone sword. For a moment, there was a stalemate. The stone sword couldn’t stab any further, but the elder couldn’t repel the stone sword either. The man and sword were in a stalemate.</p>
<p>“Who is this old fellow? He can actually withstand the power of the stone sword!” Liu Yun said in surprise.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t say a word. With a flash, he charged into the palace.</p>
<p>Liu Yun also reacted and gritted his teeth before rushing into the palace.</p>
<p>The stone sword and the jade-like elder were in a stalemate. They had no strength to stop Zhou Wen and Liu Yun. In the blink of an eye, the two of them had rushed into the hall with the bamboo slips.</p>
<p>Seeing that the elder was still in a stalemate with the stone sword, Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to rush further in. He casually took down a bamboo slip from the rack and opened it.</p>
<p>When he saw the content was laws and regulations, he randomly picked a few bamboo slips on different shelves to take a look. They were all the same. He couldn’t help but find it odd.</p>
<p>I heard that back then, Emperor Qin believed in the Art of Longevity that warlocks advocated. I originally imagined that the books he buried with him were related to alchemy and the Art of Longevity. I never expected them to be law books. Zhou Wen casually flipped through them as he walked and realized that there were no records related to alchemy. They were all about laws.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, why aren’t you leaving? What’s so interesting about those bamboo slips?” Liu Yun also flipped through a few scrolls. Seeing that they were all laws and regulations, he lost interest.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen put down the bamboo slips and quickened his pace. He and Liu Yun walked to the back of the palace and saw another door. However, it had already been opened. It was clearly Jing Daoxian’s work.</p>
<p>There was a jade screen blocking the door. The two of them circled around the screen, and the scene that greeted them left them surprised.</p>
<p>There were shattered bronze and jade fragments everywhere on the ground, as though a huge battle had ensued. However, there was no sign of anyone, nor were there any doors that led to other places.</p>
<p>“There might be a secret door,” Liu Yun said as he searched the walls, hoping to find a secret door.</p>
<p>“Stop looking. Look at the water in the pool. Is there a problem?” Zhou Wen pointed at a pool.</p>
<p>The water in the pool was black like ink, but there was no strange smell. It probably wasn’t black because of a change in water quality.</p>
<p>“Are you saying that there’s a path beneath the pool?” Liu Yun sized up the pool, but the water in the pool was too dark. He couldn’t see anything clearly.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if there’s a path down there, but there shouldn’t be a secret door in this palace.” Zhou Wen had already scanned the entire palace with Truth Listener. If there was a secret door, it was impossible for him not to have discovered it.</p>
<p>“Should we go down?” Liu Yun was somewhat hesitant.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid that’s our only choice.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he looked outside and saw that the elder had rushed in.</p>
<p>The stone sword chased after him unlike its reaction to Jing Daoxian’s entry. Wherever the sword beam went, almost everything was destroyed.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen jumped into the pool with Ya’er in his arms.</p>
<p>The Azure Dragon’s Seven Mansions Essence Energy Skill activated as though an Azure Dragon was circling his body, repelling the black liquid outside.</p>
<p>Liu Yun gritted his teeth and jumped down with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the black water in the pool didn’t seem to have any buoyancy. They rapidly plummeted the moment they entered. Furthermore, their speed increased as though there was a force pulling them down.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen’s and Liu Yun’s feet touched solid ground, the powerful impact nearly fractured their legs.</p>
<p>Before they could see their surroundings clearly, two more shadows descended from above. One of them was the jade-like elder, while the other was the stone sword.</p>
<p>The moment the stone sword landed, thousands of sword beams shot out from the sword, enveloping the area.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Liu Yun quickly dodged. Zhou Wen somersaulted and hid behind a huge object. The object blocked the stone sword’s sword beam. The storm-like sword beams struck the object, but they failed to shatter it.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen realize that the thing he was using to seek refuge was a huge pill furnace. It was more than ten meters tall and looked like it was made of copper.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t the commonly-seen bronze of that era, but a type of purple bronze.</p>
<p>The sword beam struck the purple bronze pill furnace, causing it to produce a din. However, it failed to damage the pill furnace at all.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked into the pill furnace and realized that it was filled with flames. The flames inside were already burning white, and the temperature was unimaginably high. However, the purple bronze pill furnace only felt warm, not scorching hot.</p>
<p>Strange, I’ve never heard of a pill furnace having flames inside. The flames should be beneath it to heat the furnace’s interior. Why is this furnace burning on the inside? Zhou Wen found it odd.</p>
<p>As the stone sword fought the elder, Zhou Wen took the opportunity to size up the surrounding environment. Only then did he discover in surprise that this was the peak of a mountain.</p>
<p>In the huge, pitch-black underground space, a mountain peak occupied a large space. They stood at the top of the mountain, only twenty to thirty meters away from the stone dome above them.</p>
<p>The surroundings were pitch-black. As the space was so large and there was no light, only the flames that emitted from the purple bronze furnace’s ventilation hole emitted light. This made the distant areas even darker.</p>
<p>The area that Truth Listener could sense was empty. However, a cold wind blew from afar. Furthermore, the wind was very strong, causing Zhou Wen’s clothes to stick to his body as the cold wind drilled into his bones.</p>
<p>Where did Jing Daoxian go? Zhou Wen carried Ya’er and turned his back to the cold wind. After searching for a while, he didn’t find Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>Liu Yun rushed behind the pill furnace and rendezvoused with Zhou Wen. He said, “There’s nothing on this mountaintop. There’s only a pill furnace. Do you think the pill furnace contains the Elixir of Immortality refined by the emperor?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. Otherwise, why isn’t Jing Daoxian here?” As Zhou Wen spoke, he suddenly heard a loud rumbling sound from afar as though it was thunder.</p>
<h3 id='chapter874'>Chapter 874: Wind and Fire</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“Why is there thunder underground?” Liu Yun frowned slightly before his expression gradually turned ugly. “No, it’s not thunder. It’s wind…”</p>
<p>Thunder and lightning was a very terrifying power. In contrast, most people might not understand how terrifying the wind was, but to Liu Yun, who often traveled the world, he knew that sometimes, wind was much more terrifying than thunder and lightning.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had long sensed the turbulent airflow. He was even more sensitive to wind than Liu Yun, so he naturally knew how terrifying the impending storm would be.</p>
<p>Truth Listener’s ability had already been pushed to its limits, but other than this mountain peak, the surroundings were extremely empty. There was nothing, not even a place to hide.</p>
<p>“Go to the back of the mountain.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he flew down. The airflow became more and more turbulent. He couldn’t estimate how terrifying the storm would be when it touched down. All he could do was make some preparations.</p>
<p>Liu Yun also went down. He took many grappling hooks and threw them into the cracks in the mountain wall. Using the criss-crossing rope locks, he fixed his body to the side of the mountain.</p>
<p>On the mountaintop, the stone sword was still fighting the elder. The battle between two Terror-grade experts caused space to crack. It was not a battle that ordinary people could interfere with.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The terrifying storm roared and broke through the sound barrier. The continuous sonic booms were like a thunderstorm.</p>
<p>A hurricane blew past. On the back of the mountain, not facing the storm, Zhou Wen’s and Liu Yun’s clothes were fluttering in the wind. They struggled to grab the mountain rocks and were almost blown away.</p>
<p>The ropes on Liu Yun’s body lodged into his flesh, preventing him from being blown away by the wind.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already summoned Tyrant Behemoth. After it gigantified, it hugged the mountain peak and protected him and Ya’er inside, blocking the terrifying storm.</p>
<p>The wind was even more terrifying than a blade. The Epic armor that Liu Yun was wearing had been sliced open by the wind. Blood gushed out.</p>
<p>“Come on out, Little Orange.” Liu Yun roared in the wind as an orange cat appeared on him. It opened its mouth and sucked in the wind that blew on Liu Yun. The orange cat’s stomach expanded and became like a balloon.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was worried that the orange cat would explode, the orange cat spat out the air it had sucked into its stomach to resist the airflow.</p>
<p>The terrifying wind was mostly blocked by the mountain peak. They were only suffering the remnant winds.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen and Liu Yun thought that they had finally survived the brunt of the wind, they realized that they had been too naive.</p>
<p>This was because they quickly realized that the wind that blew past had formed a flow that circled around the mountain peak.</p>
<p>The extremely violent airflow formed a vortex in the underground space. As the airflow constantly blew in, the wind vortex became stronger.</p>
<p>The orange cat on Liu Yun’s body could no longer swallow the wind. His body was swaying crazily from the wind as ropes snapped one after another. His armor had already shattered and he was about to be killed by the terrifying wind.</p>
<p>Starlight flashed in Liu Yun’s eyes as his figure transformed into a stream of light that flashed and appeared beneath Behemoth.</p>
<p>At that moment, Behemoth hugged the mountain and resisted the terrifying vortex. Even its fur was sliced open by the airflow.</p>
<p>“What the hell? What wind is this? How can it be so terrifying?” Liu Yun hid beneath Behemoth and finally heaved a sigh of relief. He couldn’t help but grumble.</p>
<p>I’m just afraid that the truly terrifying wind hasn’t arrived. Zhou Wen wore a look of worry.</p>
<p>The hurricane in the underground space strengthened as though it would never stop. If the wind speed continued to increase, even Tyrant Behemoth might not be able to withstand it.</p>
<p>The elder and the stone sword were still fighting on the mountaintop. The stone sword seemed to have an irreconcilable grudge with the elder as it held him back, preventing him from escaping.</p>
<p>The mountain peak was the eye of the storm, but at the top of the mountain, the wind speed wasn’t that strong. The elder and the stone sword fought in the center of the vortex, and the battle remained intense.</p>
<p>The pill furnace suffered countless attacks from the man and sword, but it remained intact. However, when the wind vortex rushed into the pill furnace’s ventilation hole, the wind aided the fire, causing the flames inside to burn even more vigorously. Blazing white flames spewed out from the ventilation hole at the top of the pill furnace.</p>
<p>Then, Zhou Wen and Liu Yun saw a powerful wind constantly blow into the pill furnace, causing the flames inside to spew out before being sucked into the vortex.</p>
<p>The flame was like a fire dragon as it rapidly spread in the vortex. It was about to turn the vortex into a fiery vortex.</p>
<p>If it was just the wind, Behemoth could still last for a period of time. However, with the combination of wind and fire, the might was like an annihilative force. Behemoth probably couldn’t withstand such terrifying strength.</p>
<p>“To the top of the mountain.” Zhou Wen put away Tyrant Behemoth and carried Ya’er as he rushed to the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>Now that the vortex of wind and fire had formed, the mountaintop had become the eye of the storm. There was no wind or fire there, forming a vacuum.</p>
<p>All the wind that reached the top of the mountain blew into the pill furnace and spewed out from the top. It formed a tiny safe zone beside the pill furnace. Only there could one avoid the pain of the wind and fire.</p>
<p>However, the mountaintop was already surrounded by flames. If he wanted to rush in, he had to pass through the hundred-meter thick vortex of flames.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wore the Demon Blood True Dragon Armor and could still withstand it, but Ya’er, who was in his arms, didn’t have the protection of the divine armor. She probably couldn’t withstand the heat of the flames.</p>
<p>Without any other choice, Zhou Wen switched to Civilization Country and used its teleportation ability to teleport to the mountaintop.</p>
<p>Without Behemoth’s protection, Liu Yun could only follow Zhou Wen to the top of the mountain. He summoned new armor, and the Essence Devouring Beast fused with his arm. Instantly, he transformed into a shooting star and charged through the vortex of fire.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s entire body was charred black. Many parts of his armor had melted, and his hair had been burned away. There were blisters on his body, making him look extremely disheveled.</p>
<p>Just as he entered the top of the mountain, he was nearly slashed by a sword beam. Thankfully, he reacted quickly. He rolled to a spot near the pill furnace.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also hid beside the pill furnace. The stone sword and elder were still fighting, ignoring the terrifying wind and fire vortex around them.</p>
<p>Soon, the flames in the pill furnace spread to the entire space. Terrifying tornadoes of wind and fire spun around the mountain. The stronger the wind, the stronger the flames in the pill furnace. The stronger the flames, the more terrifying it made the fiery tornadoes.</p>
<p>However, it was strange. The flames were extremely terrifying. When the rocks touched the flames, they instantly melted. However, the pill furnace and mountain didn’t show any signs of melting.</p>
<p>The mountain still felt a little hot, but the pill furnace remained the same. No matter how hot the flames in it were, the furnace was only warm to the touch.</p>
<h3 id='chapter875'>Chapter 875: Snatching the Treasure from the Pill Furnace</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The huge underground space had already become a world of wind and fire.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t pay attention to the battle between the stone sword and the elder. His attention was focused on the pill furnace.</p>
<p>No matter how one looked at it, the terrifying wind was prepared for the pill furnace. The pill furnace borrowed the wind’s might to fan the flames in the furnace such that it became extremely hot.</p>
<p>Could this pill furnace really be refining the Pill of Immortality? Zhou Wen suspected as he used Truth Listener to observe the situation inside the pill furnace.</p>
<p>However, because the wind and fire inside were too violent, he couldn’t hear much information.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was observing the pill furnace, a beam of light suddenly lit up inside. Even in the surging furnace flames, the beam of light was still very obvious.</p>
<p>“Is it finally coming out? I’ve waited so long for this day.” The elder was immediately excited when he saw the light in the furnace.</p>
<p>His body emitted a jade glow as he forced the stone sword to retreat. He flew towards the pill furnace and grabbed the lid with one hand, wanting to open it.</p>
<p>However, the stone sword refused to be outdone. It flew up again and slashed at the elder’s arm, forcing him to release the lid. Due to the pressure from the stone sword, the elder failed to open the lid several times.</p>
<p>“You’ve fought with me for so many years, but you still aren’t willing to give up?” The elder was furious. He suddenly retreated and temporarily broke away from the stone sword. The jade light on his body condensed on his right hand, causing his jade-like right hand to become even more crystalline.</p>
<p>The stone sword seemed to sense the danger as well. It no longer charged forward blindly. The stone sword also began to condense its strength as runes appeared on the stone’s blade.</p>
<p>The runes carried a strange power. The appearance of each rune made the sword seem heavier.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a careful look and realized that the runes that appeared on the stone sword was a law.</p>
<p>“Defiance of a superior… shall result in execution…”</p>
<p>With the appearance of the law, the stone sword seemed to possess unparalleled power as it slashed at the elder with a suppressive might.</p>
<p>The elder’s crystal-like right hand extended out almost at the same time.</p>
<p>The moment he extended his right hand, time and space seemed to condense. It was as though only his hand was moving. Everything else stopped.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The stone sword was actually sent flying by the elder’s right hand. The law on the sword was also destroyed.</p>
<p>Although the stone sword wasn’t injured, it couldn’t help but fly into the vortex of flames. It was unknown how it was doing.</p>
<p>After the elder sent the stone sword flying, he immediately rushed towards the pill furnace. Without the stone sword’s obstruction, he lifted the heavy lid with one hand and extended his other hand to grab the resplendent item inside.</p>
<p>Just as the elder was about to grab the item inside the furnace, a white light suddenly shone out from the furnace.</p>
<p>The elder was caught off guard and was hit by the white light. He immediately screamed and fell.</p>
<p>The resplendent light in the furnace resembled a sun as it rose from the pill furnace. After leaving the pill furnace, the item’s light slowly dimmed. Only then did Zhou Wen see that it was Jing Daoxian’s Yin Yang Mirror.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian also jumped out of the furnace and stood on it. He held the Yin Yang Mirror and smiled at the elder.</p>
<p>“Who are you? How dare you scheme against a king like me?” The elder struggled to stand up, but when Jing Daoxian waved the Yin Yang Mirror in his hand, the elder lost control of his body like a puppet. He fell off the mountain, falling into the flames.</p>
<p>“You are a mere alchemist. Do you think you are worthy of being called a king?” Jing Daoxian said disdainfully.</p>
<p>“Boss Jing, you are still the best. That old man looks rather powerful. I never expected him to be unable to withstand a single strike from you,” Liu Yun flattered.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian said, “Not really. I only took the opportunity to launch a sneak attack. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be his match either. Although he’s only an alchemist, he has fused with the Guardian of the Founding Emperor Tomb. After so many years, he has already evolved to the Terror grade. Few humans are his match now.”</p>
<p>Seeing Jing Daoxian admit that he wasn’t the elder’s match and that he had relied on a sneak attack to gain the upper hand, Zhou Wen and Liu Yun’s fear of him deepened.</p>
<p>The elder’s body was truly terrifying. He rushed out of the vortex of flames and angrily wanted to kill Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>However, he had already been injured by the Yin Yang Mirror. The Yin Yang Mirror had already locked onto his soul. With just a turn of the Yin Yang Mirror, the elder’s body flew out again.</p>
<p>The stone sword had originally treated the elder as its mortal enemy, but it didn’t take the opportunity to kill him. Instead, it charged at Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian raised the Yin Yang Mirror to fight the stone sword. The elder charged back as well, but unfortunately, he was controlled by the Yin Yang Mirror and involuntarily slammed into the stone sword’s sword beam.</p>
<p>As such, it became a battle between the elder and the stone sword again.</p>
<p>However, the elder had willingly fought the stone sword previously, while this time, he was being controlled by Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? Just now, the stone sword wished to slay the elder. Why is it dodging all the time when there’s now a chance?” Liu Yun was puzzled.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen said, “If I’m not wrong, the stone sword should have the power of a law. It’s the true existence that guards this place. Previously, the stone sword didn’t do its best to stop Jing Daoxian because it probably believes that Jing Daoxian can’t obtain the item in the pill furnace, and that old man was the real threat. That’s why it continued guarding the palace.”</p>
<p>“But now, the stone sword has realized that Jing Daoxian is a greater threat than that elder. And it can’t deal with Jing Daoxian by itself. It can’t stop Jing Daoxian from taking the thing inside the pill furnace. That’s why it doesn’t kill the elder. It hopes that the elder can escape Jing Daoxian’s control and form a tripartite situation,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s eyes lit up as he lowered his voice and used a mystic technique to transmit his voice, allowing Zhou Wen to hear him. “Now that they are restraining each other, do you and I have a chance to snatch the item in the pill furnace?”</p>
<p>At that moment, another blob of light lit up in the furnace. It was different from the light that Jing Daoxian had faked with the Yin Yang Mirror. It was as warm as jade, but it gave off a refreshing feeling in the scorching furnace.</p>
<p>“The wind and fire outside the pill furnace are already so powerful. The flames inside the pill furnace are even more terrifying. I’m afraid even Mythical armor can’t withstand it. If we enter, we will be reduced to ashes. How can we take the thing inside?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“My Star Stealer is unparalleled. What can’t I get?” Liu Yun didn’t believe that he couldn’t get what was inside the pill furnace. “Why don’t we join forces? I’ll be responsible for stealing the things inside the pill furnace. You can use your teleportation ability and the Earth Escape to help me escape. After we leave, we’ll split the items equally.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Jing Daoxian, who was engaged in an intense battle with the stone sword and the elder. Seeing no reaction from him, as though he hadn’t heard their conversation, he nodded and said, “Okay.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter876'>Chapter 876: Treasure in the Furnace</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Liu Yun saw that Jing Daoxian was doing his best to deal with the stone sword and the elder, and that he didn’t have the time to pay attention to him. Without any hesitation, a mysterious starlight lit up at the tip of his fingers. At the instant he directed them, it was as though they had passed through a black hole and vanished.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Liu Yun’s hand retracted as he let out a tragic cry. White flames burned at the tips of his fingers. The flesh on his fingertips had been burned away, revealing white bones.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the flames were still spreading rapidly. Almost instantly, the flames were about to reach Liu Yun’s palm.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was a decisive person who immediately sliced off his flaming fingers as he chopped down with his other hand.</p>
<p>When the five fingers landed on the ground, they were instantly burned to ashes. If he had been any slower, he probably wouldn’t have been able to keep his arm.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian chuckled and said, “Even top fire-elemental Mythical creatures don’t dare touch the flames in the furnace. You actually dared to reach in to grab it? You have guts.”</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s right hand had all his five fingers severed. Upon hearing Jing Daoxian’s mockery, he realized that Jing Daoxian had been watching their every move. The reason he hadn’t stopped them was because he was certain that they couldn’t take out the item inside the pill furnace.</p>
<p>Liu Yun wasn’t angry. All he did was secretly send a voice transmission to Zhou Wen. “I touched the thing in the pill furnace with my hand. It’s definitely not a pill.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” Zhou Wen asked secretly.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I only touched a portion of it. It feels like a handle, but I don’t know what it is. My hand turned to this from just touching it. I didn’t dare hold it tightly,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“Could it be something like a sword or saber?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“It’s possible.” Liu Yun nodded.</p>
<p>He had originally wanted to pull out the item inside. Even if he couldn’t take it out, he could have threatened Jing Daoxian to release his soul that was locked in the Yin Yang Mirror.</p>
<p>Now, he had injured his hand instead of taking out the item; there was naturally no hope.</p>
<p>“Let me give it a try.” Zhou Wen summoned the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, but he didn’t rush towards the pill furnace immediately.</p>
<p>The flames in the pill furnace were just too powerful. Even the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General probably couldn’t withstand them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen got the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to charge into the wind and fire vortex. The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was blown around by the wind and fire vortex.</p>
<p>However, the Fiend armor on his body gradually lit up. The purple flames in his body burned brighter and brighter. The power of the flames couldn’t injure him, but instead made him stronger.</p>
<p>Only when the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s Fiend armor had burned into something akin to amethyst and its entire body was enveloped by the purple flames did Zhou Wen get him to rush towards the pill furnace.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian only glanced coldly and did not stop the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. As he blocked the elder and the stone sword, he allowed the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General entry.</p>
<p>When the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General touched the flames, the Fiend armor immediately lit up. The originally amethyst-like Fiend armor turned purple-white due to the rapidly rising temperature. There was even magma-like liquid slowly flowing down the armor.</p>
<p>With the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s powerful body, it was still unable to withstand the flames in the furnace despite being able to borrow the power of the flames.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could sense the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s soul roaring in pain. Although he hadn’t been burned to ashes, he was still in extreme pain.</p>
<p>If he continued entering, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s body would completely melt before he touched anything inside. Therefore, Zhou Wen could only order him to leave the pill furnace.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t unsummon him. Instead, he made him stand beside him. The flames on his body were still burning crazily, and the melting situation improved slightly.</p>
<p>“Even if a Mythical Fire Elemental King were to come, they would melt in this Sun True Flames Furnace. It’s a fool’s dream to rely on a Mythical Companion Beast to take out what’s inside,” Jing Daoxian said indifferently. “The thing inside isn’t something you can take.”</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian had no intention of taking it himself, as though he was waiting for something.</p>
<p>The elder and the stone sword kept trying to kill Jing Daoxian, but Jing Daoxian was toying with them using the Yin Yang Mirror. The elder wanted to escape the Yin Yang Mirror’s control, but the effects weren’t ideal.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a sound came from the pill furnace.</p>
<p>“Wa… Wa…” Zhou Wen listened carefully and his expression changed. He looked at Liu Yun and asked, “Didn’t you say that the thing inside might be a weapon? Why is there the sound of a baby crying?”</p>
<p>Liu Yun also heard the voice inside and was alarmed. That’s not right. I clearly grabbed something that resembled a handle with my hand. How can there be a baby’s voice? Could it be that the weapon has become a spirit?</p>
<p>Impossible. It’s probably a Companion Beast, right? Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>At that moment, Jing Daoxian finally took action. With the Yin Yang Mirror in one hand to stop the stone sword and the elder, he used his other hand to reach into the pill furnace’s interior.</p>
<p>The elder and the stone sword seemed to know that the critical moment had arrived. Rows of laws suddenly appeared on the stone sword. Instantly, they tore through the void and stabbed towards Jing Daoxian’s heart.</p>
<p>The elder began to risk his life. His entire body transformed into a crystalline state as he charged at Jing Daoxian like a crystal man.</p>
<p>The power of the Yin Yang Mirror failed to control the elder.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian frowned slightly. He didn’t have the spare strength to retrieve the item in the furnace. As he held the Yin Yang Mirror to block the stone sword’s strike, he used the stone sword’s power to retreat and dodge the crystallized elder’s strike.</p>
<p>When the crystallized elder saw Jing Daoxian dodge, he charged into the cauldron, hoping to take out the item inside.</p>
<p>However, the stone sword suddenly switched sides and slashed at the elder’s head, forcing him to retreat.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian charged towards the pill furnace again, but he was stopped by the joint forces of the elder and the stone sword.</p>
<p>The two men and sword fought above the pill furnace, dazzling Liu Yun and Zhou Wen. Even with Zhou Wen’s eyesight, he could barely see their trajectories. There were many details that he couldn’t see clearly.</p>
<p>The stone sword’s sword techniques were nothing out of the ordinary. Every strike seemed to be within expectations, but it made one have no choice but to face its existence. There was no way to use tricks against it.</p>
<p>The elder’s moves were very strange. His entire body was like crystal, but his movement techniques were varied. He looked like a ghost.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian was very good at borrowing the strength of others. His strength was far inferior to the stone sword and the elder, but with the help of the Yin Yang Mirror, he could also divert the stone sword’s and the elder’s strength to hold them back. No one could take out the thing inside the pill furnace.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The three forces clashed, sending Jing Daoxian, the crystallized elder, and the stone sword flying into the vortex of wind and fire.</p>
<p>“Now.” Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate to order the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to charge at the Sun True Flames Furnace again. At the same time, he flew close to the furnace’s mouth.</p>
<p>Under Zhou Wen’s orders, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General plunged in. His body began to rapidly melt amidst the terrifying flames. He was unable to withstand the Sun True Flames inside. It looked like he wouldn’t be able to touch anything inside before turning into a pool of magma.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian and the elder knew that it was impossible for Zhou Wen and company to take out the item inside the pill furnace, so they ignored them.</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhou Wen still wanted to use the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to try his luck, they weren’t too worried despite not being able to rush back in time to stop him.</p>
<p>Just as the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was about to melt, Zhou Wen, who had already reached the furnace’s mouth, suddenly summoned a banana fan and fanned at the furnace’s mouth.</p>
<h3 id='chapter877'>Chapter 877: Miscalculation</h3>
<p>At the instant the Supreme Yin Wind, augmented by the Three Realms’ Best Wind, swept into the pill furnace, the flames inside the pill furnace that was originally roaring with wind and fire immediately converged. The airflow also became much calmer.</p>
<p>Something appeared where the wind and fire converged.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw what it was and revealed a look of surprise. However, he didn’t hesitate. The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General had already rushed over and grabbed the item before rushing out of the pill furnace.</p>
<p>In the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s hand was a golden banana fan. It was golden and resplendent like the sun.</p>
<p>The shape of the banana fan was somewhat similar to Banana Fairy’s fan shape, but it wasn’t completely the same. There was a strong flow of wind and fire Essence Energy on it, making it different from Banana Fairy.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian, the elder, and the stone sword never expected Zhou Wen to take out the item in the pill furnace. After a moment of surprise, the stone sword and the elder rushed towards the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General holding the banana fan, hoping to snatch it back.</p>
<p>With a thought, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General returned to Zhou Wen. The Sun Banana Fan also landed in front of him. Zhou Wen held the fan’s handle and could feel the heat through the Dragon Scale Armor.</p>
<p>With the elder and the stone sword rushing over, Zhou Wen held the Sun Banana Fan and fanned at them. Immediately, a scorching wind blew out. Wherever the hot wind went, flames would ignite.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that the wind and fire in the entire underground space moved with the Sun Banana Fan, turning into a terrifying fire dragon that swept towards the elder and the stone sword.</p>
<p>The elder and the stone sword used their powers of Terror transformation to meet the fire dragon.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The entire underground world shook. Although the fire dragon was defeated by the elder and the stone sword, they were also sent flying by the power of wind and fire.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian silently arrived near Zhou Wen. With a flash of the Yin Yang Mirror in his hand, Zhou Wen’s soul projection appeared. He wanted to control Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>Before Jing Daoxian could control Zhou Wen’s body, Zhou Wen threw the Sun Banana Fan in his hand. At the same time, the other banana fan in his hand flew out and transformed into a girl sitting on a banana leaf in midair. She reached out and grabbed the Sun Banana Fan.</p>
<p>“Jing Daoxian, you can use your soul to control my body, but you can’t control my Companion Beast. At most, we can just break ranks. If I can’t defeat you, I’ll just destroy that fan. No one can have it,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally believed that he had the means to negotiate, but what happened next completely exceeded his expectations.</p>
<p>After Banana Fairy grabbed the Sun Banana Fan, it turned into golden wind and fire that fused into the banana leaf beneath Banana Fairy.</p>
<p>Golden veins appeared on the emerald-like green banana leaf.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could react, a violent gust of wind erupted from Banana Fairy’s body, enveloping her before returning to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>It evolved… Zhou Wen was somewhat dumbfounded.</p>
<p>He originally wanted to use the power of the Sun Banana Fan to resist Jing Daoxian, the elder, and the stone sword. In this land of wind and fire, the Sun Banana Fan had a natural advantage. It could be said that this was its home ground.</p>
<p>However, the Sun Banana Fan had been absorbed by the banana leaf and had entered an evolutionary state. Instantly, Zhou Wen’s previous plans failed.</p>
<p>Seeing Jing Daoxian, the elder, and the stone sword staring at him, Zhou Wen felt somewhat awkward.</p>
<p>He had held back on using Banana Fairy’s ability to restrain wind and fire, hoping that she could deliver a shocking effect at the critical moment. Now, she had indeed delivered a shocking effect, but this was just too much of a shock. Even Zhou Wen didn’t expect this to happen. He felt his lips turn bitter.</p>
<p>With the Sun Banana Fan gone, the stone sword was enraged. Laws appeared on the sword as it charged at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare take the attack head-on. He used the Civilized Country ring to teleport elsewhere, but just as he teleported out, the elder’s crystalline palm had already grabbed at his neck, forcing Zhou Wen to teleport again.</p>
<p>Civilized Country was much stronger than Lost Country, but it could only teleport ten times. It was absolutely impossible to finish off the elder and the stone sword in ten teleportations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with Jing Daoxian eyeing him covetously, Zhou Wen’s chances were even slimmer.</p>
<p>“Give me your Companion Beast and I’ll help you tide through this calamity,” Jing Daoxian said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t believe Jing Daoxian at all. Seeing the elder and the stone sword charge at him again, he didn’t hesitate to activate the Civilized Country. However, he wasn’t using teleportation this time, but the positioning teleportation function.</p>
<p>The markings in the ghost face’s eyes spun as Zhou Wen instantly vanished with Ya’er in his arms.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The positioning teleportation ability of Civilized Country required him to specify a location in advance. In the future, no matter where he was, he could return there by activating the positioning teleportation function.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen had recently figured it out, he had set the coordinates not far from Mount Dragon Tiger.</p>
<p>He originally wanted to escape from the Founding Emperor Tomb and think of a way to retrieve his soul controlled by the Yin Yang Mirror in the future. However, to his surprise, he failed to teleport out and appeared at the Founding Emperor Tomb entrance.</p>
<p>Damn it. Even teleportation can’t leave the Founding Emperor Tomb? Zhou Wen didn’t have the luxury of time. If he couldn’t leave, Jing Daoxian and company would catch up to him sooner or later.</p>
<p>He directly put on the Invisibility Cloak and switched his Essence Energy Art to the Ancient Sovereign Sutra, allowing the Defy Ancient Sovereign to fuse with him. Then, he charged towards the beam of light that the elder had walked out of.</p>
<p>After taking a few steps, he felt as though some force was summoning his body, making him want to rush in the direction of the palace. Zhou Wen immediately got the Defy Ancient Sovereign to take over his body and forcefully control it to continue charging forward without being affected by the soul in the Yin Yang Mirror.</p>
<p>The pillar of light vanished. Zhou Wen found himself near an inconspicuous building in the ancient city. He didn’t hesitate to rush in.</p>
<p>The stone house wasn’t big, and it looked very simple. There were no beds or tables. There was only a stone platform with many bamboo slips on the rack beside it.</p>
<p>After passing through the room, there was another room inside. Zhou Wen walked in and saw that it was an alchemy room. There were all kinds of pill furnaces and other equipment. There were also many refined pills stored in bottles.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t stand on ceremony as he stored everything inside the Chaos Bead, regardless of whether they were useful or not.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also stored the bamboo slips. It was a waste not to take them. Perhaps they would be useful in the future.</p>
<p>Just as he finished, he heard a whistling sound from the ancient city. It was likely the stone sword that had rushed out of the temple. However, the stone sword didn’t discover Zhou Wen. It knew that Zhou Wen definitely couldn’t leave, so it constantly flew around the city, hoping to find him.</p>
<p></di</p>
<h3 id='chapter878'>Chapter 878: Jing Daoxian’s Conditions</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Soon, the elder rushed out as well. After he came out, he went straight to his room. When he rushed in, he saw that the stone house was in a mess. There was nothing left. Even the pill furnace, medicinal pestle, and other tools were gone. He was so enraged that he nearly vomited blood.</p>
<p>“It will be difficult to appease the hatred in my heart if I don’t tear you to pieces!” The elder roared at the sky and rushed out to search for Zhou Wen like a madman.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian and Liu Yun rushed out one after another. They were also searching for Zhou Wen, but he seemed to have vanished into thin air. They couldn’t find him no matter how hard they tried.</p>
<p>“Could Zhou Wen have already escaped?” Liu Yun asked Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>“Impossible. Without this Emperor Qin Sword, it’s impossible for him to leave. He must still be in the Founding Emperor Tomb,” Jing Daoxian said as he held the Emperor Qin Sword.</p>
<p>The stone sword and the elder also knew that it was impossible for Zhou Wen to escape, so they searched every corner of the ancient city and swore to find him.</p>
<p>When the elder rushed out, Zhou Wen had already used the Invisibility Cloak’s three minutes of complete invisibility. He went in the opposite direction and rushed back into the palace, passing through the black water and returning to the mountain peak in the underground space.</p>
<p>The wind in the underground space had stopped, and the fire in the Sun True Flames Furnace had extinguished.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the flames in the Sun True Flames Furnace were emitted from the Sun Banana Fan. The furnace itself doesn’t have any flames. Zhou Wen was sizing up the Sun True Flames Furnace, hoping to see if he could take it away.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s heart suddenly palpitated as he stared intently at the Sun True Flames Furnace in front of him.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian crawled out of the Sun True Flames Furnace and smiled at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you already leave?” Zhou Wen stared at Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>“It’s just an illusion. You can’t leave the Founding Emperor Tomb, so you can only hide. I’ve been here waiting for you,” Jing Daoxian said.</p>
<p>“You relied on the soul in the Yin Yang Mirror to sense my location, right?” Zhou Wen asked Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>“That’s not important. What’s important is that the alchemist and Grand Qin Dharma Sword want to kill you. The only person who can save you from Emperor Qin’s mausoleum is me,” Jing Daoxian said.</p>
<p>“Conditions?” Zhou Wen asked bluntly.</p>
<p>“That Companion Beast.” Jing Daoxian said.</p>
<p>“Impossible.” Zhou Wen knew that even if he transferred Banana Fairy to Jing Daoxian, she might not survive. Therefore, he hadn’t considered doing so.</p>
<p>“I’m not asking you to transfer the Companion Beast to me, but to promise me the usage of the Companion Beast’s abilities in the future to do something for me,” Jing Daoxian said.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Naturally, it’s pill refinement. Although there aren’t any true Elixirs of Immortality in this world, there are some pills that can extend my life. Refining those pills not only requires special materials, but the furnace and fire also have special requirements. Since the Sun Banana Fan has been absorbed by your pet, your pet must have similar powers. I’ll use her as a replacement,” Jing Daoxian said as he summoned a cloth bag and sucked the Sun True Flames Furnace into the tiny cloth bag.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still hesitating when Jing Daoxian said, “You don’t have time. The Grand Qin Dharma Sword is easy to fool, but that alchemist isn’t that easy to fool. He will quickly react and come back to capture you. I don’t think you can teleport a second time.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I agree. However, other than helping me leave, you have to release Liu Yun and my soul,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian didn’t say a word as he threw the Emperor Qin Sword in his hand at Zhou Wen. Then, with a flip of the Yin Yang Mirror, Zhou Wen’s blurry figure in the mirror vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could sense that his mind had relaxed significantly. He felt indescribably relaxed.</p>
<p>“With that Emperor Qin Sword, I believe you will be able to leave the Founding Emperor Tomb,” Jing Daoxian said.</p>
<p>“What about you?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“If I wish to leave, there’s nowhere that can retain me,” Jing Daoxian said indifferently. “He’s here. You don’t have time.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already sensed the entity rushing into the underground space, so he asked Jing Daoxian, “When are you refining the pill?”</p>
<p>“I’ll naturally look for you when the time comes,” Jing Daoxian said with a smile. “You’ve grown faster than I imagined. Or rather, the Lost Immortal Sutra has exceeded my expectations. I’m really looking forward to how far it can take you. Before that, you mustn’t die.”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>With that said, Jing Daoxian spun the Yin Yang Mirror in his hand and shot it at the elder who had already charged into the underground space. “Go. I’ll keep looking forward to our next meeting. I hope that you can give me more surprises the next time we meet.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at Jing Daoxian and used teleportation to rush to the exit of the underground space. As for the furious elder, he was entangled by Jing Daoxian and was unable to proceed with a pursuit.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned invisible and rushed out of the palace, heading for the ancient city’s entrance.</p>
<p>Just as he left the palace, he saw the Sword of Law rush back into the hall. From the looks of it, it had figured out what had happened. Unfortunately, it was already too late.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen rushed to the ancient city’s entrance, he realized that Liu Yun was standing at the entrance. He was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen’s figure appear, Liu Yun said with a smile, “I knew it. If you want to leave, you definitely have to come here.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to chat with him. He stabbed the Emperor Qin Sword into the hole in the door. The barrier that separated the ancient city and the outside immediately vanished. The two of them rushed out without any hesitation.</p>
<p>After passing through the Mercury Sea, Zhou Wen used the Earth Elemental Beast to take Liu Yun out of the Founding Emperor Tomb.</p>
<p>“We’ve finally come out alive.” Liu Yun looked at the starry sky outside and let out a long sigh.</p>
<p>“Farewell. I hope we won’t meet again in the future.” Zhou Wen rode the Earth Elemental Beast and was about to escape. He was afraid that the elder would chase after him again, so he wanted to get as far away from the Founding Emperor Tomb as possible.</p>
<p>“You got Jing Daoxian to release my soul, right?” Liu Yun stopped Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“It was probably released by Jing Daoxian in passing,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Liu Yun didn’t say a word as he extended his hand and threw something at Zhou Wen. “This is something I took out from the pill furnace. There are two in total. I’ll give one to you. Have fun with it.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t think you touched anything,” Zhou Wen caught the item and said in surprise.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sized up the item in his hand. It was a purple bronze ball. It looked like it was made of the same material as the Sun True Flames Furnace. It was about the size of a billiard ball. There were strange mysterious patterns on it, making it look ancient and mysterious.</p>
<p>“A thief doesn’t leave empty-handed. I don’t dare say anything else, but I’ve never returned empty-handed in my life. I didn’t take out that crappy fan, but I didn’t return empty-handed.” Liu Yun waved his hand and turned around to quickly walk away. Moments later, he vanished.</p>
<p>This fellow… When did he take it out… Even Jing Daoxian didn’t discover it. This thing should be from the Sun True Flames Furnace, right? I wonder what it’s used for. Zhou Wen sized it up for a while, but he couldn’t figure out what use it had. He put it away.</p>
<h3 id='chapter879'>Chapter 879: Ranking Reboot</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Zhou Wen rode the Earth Elemental Beast and left the Founding Emperor Tomb with Ya’er.</p>
<p>On the way, Zhou Wen attempted to use his phone to take a picture of the Emperor Qin Sword to see if he could get it into the game. Otherwise, having the dungeon but not being able to enter was useless.</p>
<p>After the phone entered its camera mode, it automatically locked onto the Emperor Qin Sword. With a click, the Emperor Qin Sword vanished into thin air, and an Emperor Qin Sword appeared in-game.</p>
<p>However, in-game, Emperor Qin Sword wasn’t its name, but ‘Key to the Imperial Mausoleum.’</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen inserted the Emperor Qin Sword into the ancient city’s door, it automatically vanished. The game’s door opened and didn’t close again. Even if Zhou Wen respawned in the dungeon again, he didn’t need to use the Emperor Qin Sword to open the door.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen rushed in, he grinded the Founding Emperor Tomb dungeon. The monster in the Mercury Sea was extremely difficult to kill. Typical attacks were useless against it. Its body was somewhat similar to water-elemental creatures. Even if its body was severed, it could reform.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as long as it was in the Mercury Sea, it seemed to possess infinite power. Zhou Wen momentarily couldn’t think of a way to kill it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen killed the Bronze Men and the twelve Gold Men in the city again. However, this time, Zhou Wen didn’t just use the power of the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. He summoned Tyrant Behemoth, Torch Dragon, and other Companion Beasts. Together with the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, the speed at which he killed the twelve Gold Men was much faster.</p>
<p>When he killed the seventh Gold Man, another dimensional crystal dropped. Furthermore, it was an Essence Energy Skill Crystal. The requirements were the same as the previous one.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the twelve Gold Men didn’t drop anything.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Constitution failed to meet the requirements of 41 Essence Energy and 41 Constitution, so he could only give it up in pain.</p>
<p>After circling the ancient city, he went to the stone house where the old alchemist lived. However, he didn’t see anything there. Clearly, the old man wasn’t a creature from the dungeon.</p>
<p>Could it be as Jing Daoxian said? That old man was a human alchemist from the Founding Emperor’s era? Then how did he survive in the mausoleum to the present day and how did he fuse with a Guardian? Zhou Wen was somewhat worried. If that fellow escaped the mausoleum, he would probably seek him out.</p>
<p>I hope Banana Fairy will quickly evolve to the Terror grade. Without the power of the Terror grade, it will be difficult for me to face the existence of the Terror grade head-on. Zhou Wen looked at his Banana Fairy tattoo and saw that it was still chaotic. Clearly, she hadn’t completed her evolution.</p>
<p>The door to the palace opened with a push. However, the Grand Qin Dharma Sword inside was just too powerful. Even Tyrant Behemoth was killed. Its Absolute Strength was virtually useless.</p>
<p>The Thearch really didn’t lie to me. Only a power at the Terror grade can resist a power at the Terror grade. This is no longer a matter of stats. Zhou Wen couldn’t resolve the problem of the Great Qin Dharma Sword. All he could do was wait for the invisibility ability of the Invisibility Cloak cooldown to end. He could first use the Invisibility Cloak to pass through the hall and see if it was different from reality.</p>
<p>After finally waiting for the cooldown of the Invisibility Cloak’s Wheel of Destiny to finish, Zhou Wen invisibly passed through the hall without triggering the attack of the Grand Qin Dharma Sword.</p>
<p>After passing through the hall filled with bamboo slips, he realized that this place was somewhat different from reality. Where there should have been a black pool, there was a strange bronze artifact instead. The bronze artifact was more than two meters tall, like a huge jar. It completely covered the spot where the black pool should have been. It was unknown if there was a pool below.</p>
<p>At the mouth of the jar, there was red soil and a man’s head. The man was like a flower planted in the bronze jar.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was sizing up the human head on the bronze altar, it’s eyes suddenly opened. It shot a glance at the blood-colored avatar and the blood-colored avatar died. The game screen went black.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian likely shattered the bronze jar in real life after he entered the Founding Emperor Tomb. How did he do it? Zhou Wen didn’t have the Yin Yang Mirror, so he naturally couldn’t attempt it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried a few times, but every time, he was killed by the strange man inside the bronze jar. He knew that the strange man was most likely a Terror-grade existence, so he had no choice but to give up on the idea. All he did was grind the Bronze Men and the Gold Men outside.</p>
<p>The nine black dragons in the underground sea respawned once every nine days. These Gold Men respawned once every twelve days. The pattern was very clear. It took a day to respawn a Mythical creature. The more there were, the slower the respawn.</p>
<p>Devourer, Grand Qin Dharma Sword, and the strange person in the jar. If I want to kill these fellows, I’ll probably have to wait until Banana Fairy’s evolution is complete. I wonder what Banana Fairy’s Terror transformation will be like? Zhou Wen was momentarily unable to imagine it.</p>
<p>Terror transformed creatures basically had obvious body characteristics. They were different from normal creatures.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took Ya’er to an unfamiliar city. He originally wanted to take her to eat some delicacies and buy some clothes, but when he walked to the street, he saw the black cube in the middle of the street light up.</p>
<p>The ranking battle began again. However, this time, Zhou Wen didn’t see Wang Mingyuan on the cube’s screen. The one guarding the divine tree was a snake-tailed monster.</p>
<p>Where did Teacher go? Was he implicated because I took away the divine fruit? Zhou Wen had a bad feeling.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, he suddenly saw the cube’s screen light up as a creature appeared.</p>
<p>That’s… Zhou Wen’s pupils constricted when he saw the creature’s appearance.</p>
<p>Even if Companion Beasts like True Dragon and True Phoenix were on the rankings, Zhou Wen wouldn’t find it strange. However, the creature on the rankings was a human.</p>
<p>To be precise, it was a human who had contracted a Guardian and was wearing Guardian armor.</p>
<p>Can humans and Guardians participate in the battle? Does that mean that a single Companion Beast can no longer reach the top? Zhou Wen sized up the human on the screen and saw a name appear first on the rankings.</p>
<p>Great Skyfiend! Zhou Wen silently repeated as his gaze returned to the human.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, his entire body was covered in black armor. It was impossible to see what he looked like. It was even impossible to tell if he was male or female.</p>
<p>I wonder if pure humans can participate in the ranking battle without contracting a Guardian? Zhou Wen wanted to know why Wang Mingyuan wasn’t under the divine tree.</p>
<p>However, if he couldn’t participate in the battle himself, he couldn’t use multiple Companion Beasts. Even an existence like Primordial Sword Immortal wouldn’t be able to obtain first place.</p>
<p>Teacher, what happened? Zhou Wen looked at the Great Skyfiend on the screen, but he was distracted. He still remembered that the last time he went to retrieve the divine fruit, Wang Mingyuan had secretly warned him not to go there again.</p>
<h3 id='chapter880'>Chapter 880: Transferring the Baby Tiger</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>It was somewhat different from the first ranking battle. The ranking had just started not long ago. In less than an hour, all sorts of pets filled the rankings. Many Companion Beasts on the rankings had been seen in the previous ranking battle.</p>
<p>However, Primordial Sword Immortal and Fairy Immortal Gu, who had performed extremely well the last time, weren’t on the rankings. Zhou Wen’s Tyrant Behemoth naturally wasn’t on the rankings.</p>
<p>The person ranked first was still Great Skyfiend. No matter which Companion Beasts appeared on the rankings, they couldn’t shake his position.</p>
<p>This was also within Zhou Wen’s expectations. Great Skyfiend wasn’t just referring to a Guardian. There was also the human who had fused with him, as well as various Companion Beasts that the human had. Their combined combat strength far exceeded a single Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Unless there was someone else who had similarly contracted a Guardian on the rankings, in terms of overall combat strength, it was almost impossible for ordinary Companion Beasts to surpass Great Skyfiend.</p>
<p>Various areas of the Federation were also discussing what Great Skyfiend was. Most humans didn’t know of the existence of Guardians, but anyone could tell that Great Skyfiend didn’t look like a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare stay in one place for too long. After staying for a night, he left the city.</p>
<p>It’s already the fourth day. Even if that alchemist comes out, he shouldn’t be able to find me, Zhou Wen thought as he walked. Suddenly, he was taken aback as his expression turned odd.</p>
<p>My first thought is that I’m actually worried about that alchemist and not Jing Daoxian. This is too dangerous. Now, Zhou Wen suddenly understood why Lord Alcohol and Xia Jiuhuang believed in Jing Daoxian, who was known as a devil.</p>
<p>This person was a very complicated contradiction to begin with. He did whatever he wanted and killed people without a care. But sometimes, he had a charm that made it obvious that he was evil, but it was impossible to associate him with the word evil.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed. He knew that such a thought was very dangerous. He needed to be more alert. Jing Daoxian was even more dangerous than the old alchemist.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was pondering over it, a pleasant chime sounded in-game.</p>
<p>Looking down, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be overjoyed. A baby tiger had dropped in-game.</p>
<p>Finally, another baby tiger has spawned. Zhou Wen looked at its stats. It wasn’t much different from the two baby tigers from before.</p>
<p>“What should I combine the baby tiger with?” As the baby tiger’s luck couldn’t be stacked, it could only be used for fusion.</p>
<p>However, with the lesson learned from the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, Zhou Wen didn’t dare randomly fuse it. He first matched the baby tiger with his various Companion Beasts to check their compatibility.</p>
<p>There were quite a number of Companion Beasts with high compatibility, but Zhou Wen didn’t immediately decide on fusing them.</p>
<p>I’ll put it aside for now. Zhou Wen decided to consider it later. After all, getting the baby tiger to drop was just too difficult.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen thought of the method he had learned from Liu Yun. He thought to himself, It’s fine if I don’t fuse the baby tiger. I can try transferring it, but who should I transfer it to?</p>
<p>Now, there was only Ya’er beside Zhou Wen, but it was still difficult to say if Ya’er was considered a living person. He didn’t know if she could use Companion Beasts like ordinary people.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and decided to ask her, “Ya’er, can you use Companion Beasts?”</p>
<p>Ya’er looked at Zhou Wen blankly. Clearly, she didn’t know either.</p>
<p>“Let’s do this. Let’s give it a try.” Zhou Wen decided to head to the city to buy a Mortal Companion Egg for Ya’er to see if she could hatch it.</p>
<p>If she could incubate and use Companion Beasts, Zhou Wen could give her some Companion Beasts that he didn’t need. While giving her the ability to protect herself, she could also control the Companion Beasts to help him.</p>
<p>After arriving in the city, Zhou Wen found a Companion Egg shop and bought the weakest Mortal Companion Egg. It was much more expensive than Legendary Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>The reason he chose the weakest was that Zhou Wen was afraid that incubating a Companion Egg would require too much Essence Energy and Ya’er’s body wouldn’t be able to withstand it.</p>
<p>Although she had divine-level mental strength, her body was still that of a child. If her body lacked the Essence Energy needed, something bad might happen.</p>
<p>“Try injecting your Essence Energy into the Companion Egg.” Zhou Wen handed the Companion Egg to Ya’er.</p>
<p>“Do you know what Essence Energy is?” Zhou Wen thought for a moment before asking her. As Ya’er was a Kuman Nee in the past, he didn’t know if she cultivated in Essence Energy Arts.</p>
<p>Ya’er nodded and took the Companion Egg. Soon, the Companion Egg in her hand hatched and transformed into a stream of light that transformed into a tattoo on Ya’er’s body.</p>
<p>So she can really use Companion Beasts! Zhou Wen thought for a moment. He wanted to first transfer the baby tiger to Ya’er. He wanted her to be luckier and passively increase his luck. After all, Ya’er would always be with him.</p>
<p>He successfully transferred the baby tiger to Ya’er, and Zhou Wen had only sacrificed a star in the Pocket Universe.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Furthermore, with the evolution of the Pocket Universe, that star could still be reborn in the future.</p>
<p>This Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art is really awesome. With this Essence Energy Art, won’t I be able to exchange Companion Beasts? Unfortunately, not everyone knows the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art. Otherwise, I could exchange Companion Beasts at will. Zhou Wen marveled inwardly as he increasingly liked this Essence Energy Art.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen transferred a few Companion Beasts to Ya’er before telling her how to use their abilities.</p>
<p>Ya’er was very smart. As long as Zhou Wen told her what to do, she could use them perfectly without making any mistakes.</p>
<p>“Ya’er, you’re really smart.” Zhou Wen stroked Ya’er’s head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a huge detour and when they arrived at a city again, the first on the ranking was still Great Skyfiend. Apart from Great Skyfiend, no other Guardian had entered the rankings.</p>
<p>There shouldn’t only be one Guardian. At the very least, Jiang Yan has Burial Immortal. Why didn’t he participate in the battle? Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>However, he realized that the ranking battle had only recently started. There was still plenty of time. It was also possible that some Guardians wanted to secretly hide their strength and hadn’t chosen to fight.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the Battle of Guardians is about to officially surface. Zhou Wen continued on his journey with Ya’er. After walking so much and going to so many unfamiliar places, Glimmer’s evolution speed remained stagnant. Although it kept improving, its progress was rather slow.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen headed north, planning on heading to the North District where the Ultimate Family Clan was. There were many dimensional creatures he had never seen before, as well as many novel dungeons. Since he had to walk around, he might as well download some new dungeons.</p>
<p>However, before he could even walk out of the East District, Zhou Wen saw an elder slowly walking over from the opposite side on a flat road.</p>
<p>Although he was still a distance away from the elder, Zhou Wen had already identified the elder as the alchemist in the Founding Emperor Tomb. Not only had he got out, but he had also found Zhou Wen after so many days.</p>
<h3 id='chapter881'>Chapter 881: Crazy Escape</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Without a word, Zhou Wen rode the Earth Elemental Beast and used Earth Escape to get far away.</p>
<p>However, after the Earth Elemental Beast’s Earth Escape ended, he realized that the elder had also appeared beside him. He had also used Earth Escape to follow him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen cursed inwardly as he made the Earth Elemental Beast use Earth Escape again. This time, Zhou Wen chose to let the Earth Elemental Beast expend all its Essence Energy in one go and use a long-distance Earth Escape that spanned hundreds of kilometers.</p>
<p>Just as he came out of the Earth Escape, he saw the elder walk out from a tree beside him. He was like a ghost hidden in the tree.</p>
<p>Wood Escape Art? Zhou Wen’s heart chilled.</p>
<p>Not only did the elder know the Earth Escape technique, but he also knew the Wood Escape technique. If not for the fact that he couldn’t use it in the imperial mausoleum, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have escaped so easily.</p>
<p>“You won’t be able to escape,” the elder said coldly as he stared at Zhou Wen. He wasn’t anxious at all as he slowly approached Zhou Wen like a cat chasing a mouse.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen used the teleportation ability of the Civilized Country. At the same time that the teleportation ended, he activated the invisibility power of Invisibility Cloak.</p>
<p>After activating the Invisibility Cloak, he teleported several times and changed the direction of his escape.</p>
<p>However, soon, Zhou Wen realized that the elder had followed him again. In front of the elder was something that resembled a hairpin. No matter where Zhou Wen fled in, the hairpin would point in his direction.</p>
<p>The elder clearly couldn’t see Zhou Wen, but under the hairpin’s guidance, Zhou Wen couldn’t shake off his tail.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was extremely anxious. He only had three minutes of complete invisibility. If he couldn’t shake off the elder in three minutes, ordinary invisibility was useless against such an expert.</p>
<p>There’s less than two minutes left of complete invisibility. If I don’t destroy that hairpin-like thing, it’s impossible for me to escape. Zhou Wen made a prompt decision and stopped running. He suddenly changed his position and exploited his invisibility to slash at the hairpin floating beside the elder.</p>
<p>The elder chased in the direction the hairpin pointed, but the hairpin could only point in a direction, not the location. He never expected Zhou Wen to have the guts to turn around and charge back.</p>
<p>By the time he realized it, Zhou Wen was already in front of the hairpin. The Light Concealment Sword slashed at the hairpin with the power of Immortal Slaying.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, the elder with the cold eyes threw a crystalline palm at Zhou Wen’s chest. It was so fast that it was difficult for him to dodge.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no intention of dodging. The Light Concealment Sword slashed at the hairpin, slicing it into two.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Wen’s chest, it was destroyed by the elder’s palm, turning into white smoke.</p>
<p>When the white smoke dissipated, Zhou Wen had already vanished. A shattered paper talisman floated to the ground.</p>
<p>He actually has a Substitute Talisman. The elder frowned slightly as he searched for Zhou Wen’s tracks, but he didn’t find anything.</p>
<p>Without the hairpin, the elder couldn’t determine Zhou Wen’s location.</p>
<p>“You won’t be able to escape.” The elder took out a few copper coins and condensed his Essence Energy. He threw them to the ground and began calculating with his fingers, as though he was trying to divine Zhou Wen’s location.</p>
<p>However, after calculating for a while, a look of puzzlement appeared on his face. Strange. My six lines of insight can’t divine his location?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was frantically running for his life when he suddenly felt something tremble. On a second look, he realized that it was something Ya’er was wearing.</p>
<p>It was the three copper coins and red string that Zhou Wen had taken out of the Pixiu’s stomach when he had killed it.</p>
<p>Later on, he gave it to Ya’er who wore it on her wrist. At that moment, the copper coin actually trembled automatically for some reason.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare stop as he continued fleeing with Ya’er. Thankfully, the elder didn’t chase after him again. The invisibility time limit had passed as Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>All this time, he drew Substitute Talismans whenever he had the time. Up to now, he had only succeeded in drawing two. He had just used one, leaving him with only one.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare stay any longer. He summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull and made it rush into the mountainous area at its fastest speed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of getting lost since he had the Pocket Universe’s positioning. He was just afraid of encountering an unknown dimensional zone. However, at this stage, he couldn’t care less. All he could do was escape in the direction of the more concealed areas.</p>
<p>After crossing one mountain after another, Zhou Wen didn’t know how far he had run. There were no more roads and he found himself by a small river.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed the river. There was a large peach blossom forest on both sides of the river. The peach blossoms landed in the river and flowed along it, making the river appear especially beautiful.</p>
<p>After walking for more than five kilometers, he reached the end of the river. The area ahead was blocked by a mountain. Just as Zhou Wen was about to go around the mountain, he saw a gap that allowed him to pass through. He could vaguely see the light from the other side of the mountain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate as he passed through the mountain crack.</p>
<p>The mountain crack was extremely narrow when he first entered. After walking for a short distance, it gradually widened. Soon, Zhou Wen passed through the mountain and saw a beautiful valley in front of him.</p>
<p>There were many wooden houses and bamboo buildings in the mountain valley. There were bamboo forests and flowers everywhere. Similarly, there were large peach trees. The wooden houses and bamboo buildings dotted the area, like a paradise on earth.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. This was because after he passed through the mountain crack, he failed to determine his location with Pocket Universe.</p>
<p>This place… Could it be that legendary place? Zhou Wen sized up the valley with a strange expression as he suddenly thought of an essay he had read in school.</p>
<p>The essay was called “Peach Blossom Spring.” It mentioned that a fisherman had accidentally entered a peach blossom garden. There he saw a beautiful village that was isolated from the world. However, after he left, he couldn’t find the peach blossom forest or the village no matter how hard he tried.</p>
<p>No matter how Zhou Wen looked at it, it seemed to be identical to the place described in Peach Blossom Spring. The only difference was that in the Peach Blossom Spring in the essay, there was a group of Pre-Qin villagers who had taken refuge in war. However, although there were wooden houses and wooden buildings here, Zhou Wen didn’t see anyone. He didn’t even see a chicken or dog.</p>
<p>Using Truth Listener’s ability to scan the valley, he felt as though there was a fog enveloping the valley. He could see it with his eyes, but he couldn’t see anything with Truth Listener’s ability.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if this is Peach Blossom Spring, it’s definitely a dimensional zone. Zhou Wen was somewhat curious as he summoned a group of Poison Bats and got them to fly into the village to scout and see what was inside.</p>
<p>However, after the Poison Bats left Zhou Wen’s line of sight, he suddenly lost contact with them. This made Zhou Wen’s expression turn nasty.</p>
<p>“Is anyone there?” Zhou Wen called out to the depths of the valley, but no one answered him. Instead, his voice echoed in the valley repeatedly.</p>
<p>“Is anyone there… Is anyone there… Is anyone…”</p>
<h3 id='chapter882'>Chapter 882: The Man in White</h3>
<p>This place was strange, very strange. Zhou Wen wanted to backtrack, but when he turned around, the mountain wall crack he had come from had vanished. Behind him was a complete mountain wall. There was no way out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out to touch the mountain wall. It was made of real stone, not an illusion.</p>
<p>Feeling that something was amiss, Zhou Wen summoned a Poison Bat and attempted to have it fly out through the sky. However, when the Poison Bat flew out of the valley, it seemed to hit something and fell from the sky.</p>
<p>This outcome didn’t surprise Zhou Wen. If this was really a dimensional zone, it was normal that it couldn’t fly out.</p>
<p>How can I leave this dimensional zone? Seeing that there was no way out, Zhou Wen had no choice but to walk deeper in, hoping to find a way to leave the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>He summoned different Companion Beasts to scout ahead. There were Runic Heavy-Armored Warriors, Flying Ants, and some small green-furred Gu.</p>
<p>The valley was as beautiful as a fairyland, but there was no living creature. There was no aura of a living person in the wooden houses and bamboo buildings.</p>
<p>Under Zhou Wen’s control, a green-furred Gu burrowed into the wooden hut closest to him. It realized that there were all sorts of daily necessities used by humans in the wooden hut. However, those things looked ancient, unlike those used by modern humans. Furthermore, there was no one inside, nor were there any dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to continue exploring. Strangely, there were no creatures in the valley. The Poison Bats that he had lost contact with had vanished.</p>
<p>After circling the entire valley, he realized that it wasn’t small at all. There was even a stream circling it, and the scenery was especially beautiful.</p>
<p>Beside the stream was a huge peach tree. The tree was covered in flowers, making it look gorgeous.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, there were no other peach trees beside the huge peach tree. The other peach trees were a distance away from the huge peach tree, making it look a little lonely.</p>
<p>After circling the valley twice—a place that looked like paradise—he would have found this place a great place if not for suddenly losing contact with his Companion Beasts after they went beyond a certain range.</p>
<p>There must be something in this valley. Where are they hiding? Zhou Wen searched for a long time but failed to find a way out. Similarly, he failed to find the Companion Beasts that had lost contact with him.</p>
<p>It was useless to walk around. Zhou Wen sat down to rest as he thought of various possibilities.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if this was the legendary Peach Blossom Spring as everything here was slightly different from the legendary Peach Blossom Spring.</p>
<p>Time ticked by. Zhou Wen failed to come up with a way to leave this place. Although he had tried to force his way out, it was useless.</p>
<p>The Earth Elemental Beast’s Earth Escape technique could only circle around the valley, preventing it from escaping.</p>
<p>The mountain wall seemed to have a life of its own. The hole that Tyrant Behemoth dug out would be quickly filled up.</p>
<p>The sky gradually darkened as a moon rose into the sky.</p>
<p>A strange sound suddenly appeared in the originally silent valley. Zhou Wen tilted his head to listen. It was the sound of a flute.</p>
<p>After determining the direction, the sound of the flute seemed to come from the stream.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been searching the valley the entire day, but he hadn’t found any clues. Now that there was a sudden sound of a flute, he naturally wanted to take a look.</p>
<p>Even if it was a dimensional creature, he would at least gain some understanding of what to do. He wasn’t as aimless as he was now.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully walked to the stream and, from afar, saw a person in white sitting under a huge peach blossom tree. He held a flute in his hand, and the sound was coming from it.</p>
<p>From where Zhou Wen was, he could only see the person’s side profile. He was dressed in white with his long hair tied up. Wherever the peach blossoms fell, he would gently blow into the bamboo flute, making him look like a deity.</p>
<p>It’s impossible for someone to really be here. It should be a humanoid dimensional creature. I wonder how strong he is? Zhou Wen stood motionless as he sized up the white-robed man from afar.</p>
<p>After the tune ended, the white-robed man put down the bamboo flute in his hand and turned to look at Zhou Wen. “Since you’re here, why don’t you have a drink with me?”</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen see that the white-robed man was handsome. On the ground beside him was a jade alcohol flask and wine cups.</p>
<p>Is he really not a human? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled when he saw that his appearance and actions resembled a human.</p>
<p>Seeing a motionless Zhou Wen, the white-robed man picked up the alcohol flask and wine cup and poured himself a cup. As he drank, he looked at the moon in the sky and said, “Life is so short. Why seek frustrations?”</p>
<p>The white-robed man was enjoying the moon and drinking, but Zhou Wen couldn’t help but ask, “Who are you?”</p>
<p>“Immortal,” the person in white answered.</p>
<p>“What immortal?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“Immortals are immortals. They are carefree, happy, and comfortable,” the white-robed man said.</p>
<p>Seeing that he couldn’t get an answer, Zhou Wen asked, “Do you know how to get out of here?”</p>
<p>“Why do you want to leave? Isn’t this place good? It’s aloof from worldly affairs and there are no worries. Is there any place better than this in this world?” the person in white said as he drank.</p>
<p>“This place is very good, but I don’t like it here,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You can’t leave. This is an immortal realm, a place isolated from the mortal world. Unless one dies, no one can leave this place,” the white-robed man said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally refused to believe the white-robed man’s words. As long as it was a dimensional zone, there was definitely a way to leave.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat hesitant, unsure if he should immediately attack the white-robed man. This white-robed man looked like a human, but he was likely a dimensional creature. However, with his high intelligence, his strength was definitely extraordinary. Zhou Wen was wondering if he should wait for Banana Fairy to complete her evolution before taking action.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen looked at the white-robed man and wanted to say something, but he was surprised to discover that the white-robed man had vanished under the peach blossom tree.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen called out a few times, but no one responded. He searched the valley again, but he didn’t see the white-robed man again.</p>
<p>He waited until daybreak, but he didn’t see any living creatures again.</p>
<p>What kind of dimensional zone is this? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>If a horde of dimensional creatures were to pounce at him, Zhou Wen knew what to do. But his current situation left him at a loss.</p>
<p>No, the next time I see that white-robed person, I have to think of a way to subdue him and figure out how to leave this place. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and summoned Explosive Fiend Man to make some arrangements in the valley.</p>
<p>With such a highly-intelligent dimensional creature, it was definitely not easy to deal with. Zhou Wen had no choice but to make preparations in advance—just in case.</p>
<p></di</p>
<h3 id='chapter883'>Chapter 883: Thirteen Moves Sword Technique</h3>
<p>However, in the next few days, Zhou Wen didn’t see the white-robed man again. The entire valley was empty, making Zhou Wen suspect that this dimensional zone was a prison specially used to hold people.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Ya’er was by Zhou Wen’s side. Although she seldom spoke, having someone by his side made him feel much better.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen set up the traps in the valley, he grinded his phone as he waited for the white-robed person to appear again.</p>
<p>This wait lasted for seven days. Seven nights later, Zhou Wen finally heard the familiar sound of a flute. He hurriedly ran to the peach blossom tree by the stream and saw the white-robed man sitting at the spot where he had been playing the flute.</p>
<p>The sound of his flute was quiet and ethereal, making one feel relaxed after hearing it. It gave one a sense of freedom that allowed one to forget their worries.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s mind was firm and he wasn’t affected by the flute’s sound. He only thought about how to subdue the white-robed man and ask him how to leave.</p>
<p>“We meet again.” After the tune, the white-robed man looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Do you want a drink this time?”</p>
<p>“I just want to know how to leave this place.” Zhou Wen stared intently at the white-robed man. No matter what, he couldn’t allow him to disappear like the previous time.</p>
<p>“It looks like you’ve already made up your mind,” the person in white said as he held his wine glass.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly as he gripped the Bamboo Blade in his hand.</p>
<p>“Alright then. I can tell you how to leave this place, but I have a condition,” the white-robed man said, surprising Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What condition?” Zhou Wen looked at the white-robed man in surprise.</p>
<p>“Do you know how to use a sword?” the person in white said as he fiddled with the wine cup.</p>
<p>“Not really. I’ve only learned a few sword techniques,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“It’s fine even if you don’t. I have a sword technique here. As long as you can learn this sword technique, I’ll tell you the way to leave this place,” said the white-robed man.</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed. He had never seen such a dimensional creature.</p>
<p>“No reason. Do you want to learn it?” The person in white didn’t explain.</p>
<p>“I’ll learn.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>“My sword technique has a total of thirteen moves. It’s not too difficult. No matter how stupid you are, you should be able to learn it in five days.” As the white-robed man spoke, he stood up and casually picked up a withered branch from the ground before performing his swordplay.</p>
<p>He used the branch as a sword and demonstrated the set of sword techniques. The sword technique was ethereal and elegant, without any killing intent.</p>
<p>Most sword techniques in the world pursued the ability to injure enemies, but this sword technique of his didn’t have any oppression. Instead of saying it was for killing enemies, it was more like a swordplay that was for entertainment.</p>
<p>Soon, the white-robed man finished demonstrating the thirteen sword moves. He looked at Zhou Wen with a faint smile. “Have you memorized them?”</p>
<p>“Got it.” Zhou Wen had an excellent memory, and the thirteen moves weren’t too complicated. He remembered every move clearly.</p>
<p>The person in white smiled. “Find me after you’ve mastered it.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to go through so much trouble. I’ll show it to you now. It shouldn’t be too difficult to master it in a night. As long as I can demonstrate the complete sword technique, it’ll count as me mastering it, right?” Zhou Wen said to the white-robed man.</p>
<p>“That’s right. As long as you can completely use that sword technique once, I’ll count you as mastering it.” The bamboo flute in the white-robed man’s hand spun between his fingers.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll demonstrate it to you now,” Zhou Wen said as he summoned a Legendary thin sword. It was a Companion Egg that had dropped from the Ancient Sword Tomb. It wasn’t usually of much use. Based on its size, it was more suitable for this sword technique, so Zhou Wen casually summoned it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the sword and recalled the white-robed man’s sword technique in his mind. After confirming that he hadn’t forgotten any details, Zhou Wen began striking.</p>
<p>With his combat experience and talent, it was too easy for him to imitate a set of sword techniques. Even if it were more than a hundred moves, Zhou Wen could replicate them with just one look; what’s more thirteen moves.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen stabbed out with his sword, he was stunned. He couldn’t continue the swordplay after the thrust.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that the sword technique’s moves were difficult. With Zhou Wen’s present physique, he could carry out any movement as long as a human body was capable of doing it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen couldn’t continue the thrust no matter what he did. This was because he realized that the sword technique in his memories was somewhat different from the one the white-robed man had demonstrated.</p>
<p>Strange! How is it different? Zhou Wen frowned slightly as he retracted the sword he had thrust out and carefully recalled the white-robed man’s sword techniques.</p>
<p>Memories of the sword technique appeared clearly in Zhou Wen’s mind, but his expression gradually changed.</p>
<p>This was because the sword technique in his mind was completely different from the one he had just memorized.</p>
<p>This feeling was very strange. It was like a person clearly remembering someone in red clothes, but when they recalled it again, the color of the person’s clothes turned white.</p>
<p>The clashing of memories was something Zhou Wen had never encountered before.</p>
<p>He turned to look at the white-robed man and wanted to ask him what was going on, but there was no one under the peach blossom tree. The white-robed man had long vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned slightly as he recalled the thirteen moves. This time, it was different from the previous two memories.</p>
<p>It was like Zhou Wen had memorized three different sword techniques. Although the sword techniques all had thirteen moves, the styles were completely different.</p>
<p>The sword technique demonstrated by the white-robed man was elegant, but the sword technique in Zhou Wen’s memory was ferocious and domineering in his second memory. The sword technique in his third memory was mild and mysterious, making Zhou Wen doubt his own memories.</p>
<p>Then, when Zhou Wen wanted to carefully recall it again, he realized that the sword technique had changed again. The sword technique he recalled every time seemed different.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Zhou Wen’s expression changed constantly. He was certain that there was nothing wrong with his memory, but why was his memory constantly changing? Zhou Wen couldn’t figure it out.</p>
<p>Is it an illusion? Zhou Wen quickly rejected this thought. He was very focused. Even an illusion couldn’t shake his will. If it was purely an illusion, it was impossible for it to affect his brain.</p>
<p>If it’s not an illusion, then there’s something wrong with the sword technique itself. Zhou Wen recalled the thirteen moves again and again. He wanted to try and see how many different memories he had.</p>
<p>The night passed as the sun rose and set. When night came again, Zhou Wen had already recalled more than a hundred times, but the sword techniques he recalled were different every time. None of them were repeated.</p>
<p>With the moon above the branches, the white-robed man appeared under the peach blossom tree again. He sat on a tree root and held a wine flask in one hand and a wine cup in the other. As he poured himself wine, he asked, “Have you memorized it?”</p>
<p></di</p>
<h3 id='chapter884'>Chapter 884: Three Thousand Sword Intent</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“What sword technique is this?” Zhou Wen asked the white-robed man.</p>
<p>Previously, he hadn’t been interested in the white-robed man’s sword technique. He only wanted to memorize the sword technique and get the white-robed man to tell him the way to leave. Therefore, he didn’t even ask for the name of the sword technique.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen had no choice but to take this unassuming sword technique seriously. This was because he couldn’t confidently tell the white-robed man that he had memorized the sword technique.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t have a name. Whatever you think it is will be its name,” the person in white said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned as he looked at the white-robed man. He didn’t say a word for a while. Although he had long imagined that the white-robed man wouldn’t tell him the way to leave so easily, the strangeness of the sword technique exceeded his imagination.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to demonstrate it to you again?” the white-robed man asked Zhou Wen with a smile.</p>
<p>“There’s no need.” Zhou Wen shook his head and gestured with the sword in his hand. At the same time, he kept recalling the white-robed man’s thirteen-move sword technique.</p>
<p>The white-robed man’s sword technique seemed to contain infinite changes. Every time Zhou Wen recalled something, it was different. For the next few days, Zhou Wen kept recalling and gesturing with his sword, but there was no result.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen’s eyes were bloodshot as though he was possessed.</p>
<p>Under the pure moonlight, the white-robed man sat under the peach blossom tree. As he watched Zhou Wen practice his swordplay, he fiddled with the wine cup in his hand and muttered to himself, “Why try to fix something that was not broken in the first place?”</p>
<p>As he spoke, the white-robed man downed the wine in his cup.</p>
<p>The stream under the moonlight reflected the figure of the white-robed man, but the reflection wasn’t that of a handsome man, but a skeleton in ragged clothes.</p>
<p>After another two days, Zhou Wen felt as though he had been possessed. He sat under the peach blossom tree in a daze, his eyes turning blood-red. He was in a terrible state.</p>
<p>Ya’er continued following Zhou Wen obediently. She didn’t say a word or disturb him.</p>
<p>Night descended upon the valley again as the white-robed man appeared under the peach blossom tree. He looked at the bedeviled Zhou Wen as a strange glint flashed in his eyes. Then, he looked at Ya’er, who was sitting beside Zhou Wen. “Young lady, do you want to learn sword techniques?”</p>
<p>Ya’er looked at the white-robed man expressionlessly without any reaction. It was as if she couldn’t understand him.</p>
<p>“Is he your father? It looks like your father doesn’t have a good memory. He can’t even remember such a simple sword technique after learning it for so many days. I find you smart. If it’s you, you should be able to learn it quickly. When the time comes, you can leave with your father,” the white-robed man said to Ya’er.</p>
<p>Ya’er continued looking at him expressionlessly without any reaction.</p>
<p>“Forget it. You are still young. I’m afraid you still don’t know what a sword is. It’s fine if you don’t learn it. Let me personally deliver you to freedom. Just like your father, you will forever stay in this carefree place,” the white-robed person muttered to himself.</p>
<p>With that said, the white-robed man stood up. He held the bamboo flute in his hand as he walked towards Ya’er.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to reach Ya’er, the bamboo flute in his hand stabbed at Ya’er’s heart like a blade.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>A saber beam flashed as the bamboo flute in the white-robed man’s hand was instantly sliced into two. Zhou Wen held the Bamboo Blade in his hand as he stood up and stared coldly at the white-robed man.</p>
<p>“How is that possible?” The white-robed man looked at Zhou Wen in shock as though he had seen a ghost.</p>
<p>“I’ve already memorized your sword technique,” Zhou Wen said as he held the Bamboo Blade and stared at the white-robed man.</p>
<p>“Impossible. It’s impossible for you to memorize it.” The white-robed man didn’t believe Zhou Wen at all.</p>
<p>“Why?” The blood vessels in Zhou Wen’s eyes slowly receded as he pointed the Bamboo Blade in his hand at the white-robed man.</p>
<p>“Because…” The person in white was speechless.</p>
<p>“That’s because it’s not a thirteen-move sword technique at all. It’s a combination of three thousand sword intents. Every time I recall it, I will sense a different sword intent. No matter how good my memory is, it’s impossible for me to memorize all three thousand sword intents, right?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That’s right. It’s a sword technique that humans can’t master to begin with. You actually didn’t fall into the endless cycle of sword intent. You do have some ability. Unfortunately, you failed to learn my sword technique, so you naturally can’t leave this place. You will ultimately die here. It’s just the difference between early and late death,” said the white-robed man.</p>
<p>“Who said I didn’t master it?” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>“It’s useless no matter what you say. It’s impossible for you to master it,” said the white-robed man.</p>
<p>“Then watch carefully.” Zhou Wen used his saber as a sword and stabbed at the white-robed man. It was the first move the white-robed man had demonstrated.</p>
<p>The white-robed man was slightly surprised as he quickly retreated. However, Zhou Wen kept unleashing an endless stream of techniques. In a moment, he used all of the sword techniques demonstrated by the white-robed man. It was identical to the sword technique used by the white-robed man.</p>
<p>“Is that all? Then I’m sorry to tell you that you didn’t master my sword technique,” the person in white said with a sneer.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as he continued delivering the sword technique. One sword strike after another surged out like a river. At times, it was ferocious, but at times, it was brisk. After every thirteen moves, the style of the sword technique would change.</p>
<p>“No… Impossible…” The person in white seemed to have thought of something, but he couldn’t believe it. The expression on his face was mixed with fear, suspicion, disbelief, and other emotions.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s sword technique continued. He used all the sword techniques he had once recalled, and he used them in perfect order.</p>
<p>“How can there be such a thing… Impossible… Three thousand sword intents… How can you memorize all of them…” The expression on the white-robed man’s face had already become ferocious and twisted. He no longer had the elegance and confidence from before.</p>
<p>“I don’t have any other strengths; my only strength is that I’m sufficiently focused. I can remember things that others can’t. It’s indeed difficult to remember three thousand sword intents, but I still memorized them.” Zhou Wen constantly used sword moves.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen’s sword moves changed, the surrounding space seemed to distort and change. The originally beautiful valley gradually turned into ruins filled with withered branches and charred wood.</p>
<p>The elegant white-robed man gradually turned into a ragged skeleton.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen demonstrated all his sword techniques, the skeleton collapsed and leaned against the tree which looked like it had been struck by lightning. The tree no longer had any leaves and was charred black.</p>
<p>“Impossible… It’s impossible for anyone to memorize… Impossible…” The skeleton was still muttering to itself as though it was possessed. In the end, the soul fire in its eyes gradually extinguished, becoming lifeless.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked around and realized that the valley was completely different from the one he had seen before. There was scorched earth everywhere. It was no peach blossom spring, but a dead zone.</p>
<p>There was no longer any water in the stream. There were bones everywhere, like a river of bones from hell.</p>
<h3 id='chapter885'>Chapter 885: Great Skyfiend Master’s Challenge</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>It was unknown what had happened here. It was as though a thunderstorm had struck it. All the trees were charred black, and so were the houses.</p>
<p>The skeleton under the tree no longer had any vitality. His clothes were tattered and there were charred marks in many places. It looked like he had been struck by lightning.</p>
<p>And the crack appeared on the mountain wall where Zhou Wen had entered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at the skeleton and turned to walk out of the valley. After walking out of the crack in the mountain, his Pocket Universe locating ability was immediately restored.</p>
<p>What a strange dimensional zone. Zhou Wen looked at the mountain wall behind him and realized that the crack had vanished as though it had never appeared.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen many dimensional zones, but this time, it was a wonder. Although he hadn’t been able to kill a dimensional creature, it wasn’t without benefits. The 3,000 sword intents were genuine. It was extremely beneficial for Zhou Wen’s swordplay practice.</p>
<p>After being trapped in the valley for so many days, Zhou Wen was worried that the old alchemist would have caught up. After leaving the valley, he left with Ya’er in one direction at full speed.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen tried his best to choose a path that humans were still using to prevent himself from falling into a strange dimensional zone like Peach Blossom Spring.</p>
<p>When he arrived at a human city, he realized that everyone in the city was talking about Great Skyfiend.</p>
<p>After searching online, he immediately knew what had happened.</p>
<p>A Mythical Companion Beast ranked in the top ten had challenged Great Skyfiend, but it was instantly killed. It didn’t even have the chance to escape or admit defeat.</p>
<p>This was not the most shocking thing. The most shocking thing was that the Great Skyfiend actually said that she was called Uesugi Nao and was from the Overseas Federation.</p>
<p>Humans could actually participate in the ranking battle. Furthermore, she was from overseas, and had actually obtained first place on the rankings. Such explosive news immediately spread throughout the Federation. The Federation’s upper echelons had no way of controlling it.</p>
<p>There were cubes everywhere. Many people had seen Uesugi Nao’s speech, so there was no way to hide it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Uesugi Nao even admitted that she was Orochi’s master. In front of the entire world, she officially challenged Tyrant Behemoth’s master in a bid to avenge her humiliation.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Most of the Federation’s citizens hoped that Tyrant Behemoth’s owner would participate in the battle and defeat the overseas Uesugi Nao.</p>
<p>However, most people didn’t know who Tyrant Behemoth’s owner was. They only guessed that it was likely someone from the six families. Therefore, many media outlets were exerting pressure on them, hoping that the six families could get Tyrant Behemoth to fight.</p>
<p>However, on the fourth day, the six families didn’t respond. This left the Federation citizens very displeased.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had just learned of this matter, so it was naturally impossible for him to challenge Uesugi Nao. Even if he had known earlier, he wouldn’t have challenged her.</p>
<p>Without a Guardian, there was no way to enter the cube to participate in the battle. A pure human body couldn’t meet the requirements of being at the Mythical stage, nor could it activate the cube to enter the rankings.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, are you going to participate in the battle? That Uesugi Nao is very arrogant. Go and teach her a lesson.” Zhou Wen unlocked his phone and realized that many people had left him a message. This message was from Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Do you have any plans to fight? If you plan on fighting and need any help, our Zhang family is willing to support you. This is what my brother wants me to tell you.” This was from Zhang Yuzhi.</p>
<p>There were also some messages from other people. Basically, they were all related to the matter of Uesugi Nao.</p>
<p>“I’m not fighting.” Zhou Wen sent a group message and replied en masse.</p>
<p>“That’s such a pity. If you defeat Uesugi Nao, you will be a true national hero,” Li Xuan replied.</p>
<p>“I’m not suitable to be a hero.” Zhou Wen paused before asking, “How are you? When are you coming back?”</p>
<p>“I’m almost done learning here. I’ll be back in a couple of weeks. Why? Do you miss me, your handsome eldest senior brother?” Li Xuan joked.</p>
<p>“That’s right. I miss you dearly. When you return, you have to inform me immediately.” Zhou Wen had recently gained new insights into the Defy Ancient Sovereign Life Soul. He needed a sufficiently strong opponent to be his sparring partner and help him advance to the final Perfect Body. After some thought, he realized that Li Xuan was the most suitable candidate.</p>
<p>“Haha, definitely.” Li Xuan was still very happy. He had no idea what awaited him when he returned.</p>
<p>After a while, An Sheng also sent a message. “Young Master Wen, Madam has already investigated the matter regarding Xie Yukun that you mentioned. It’s true that six people in that department, including Xie Yukun, vanished at the same time. That period was when Old Mister Ouyang set up an expedition team to Zhuolu.”</p>
<p>“In that case, this matter might be related to that department?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“That’s hard to say. Due to all sorts of reasons, those people have resigned. It’s still unknown if their actions are related to that department. We are still investigating further,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“How can there be such a coincidence? Six people from a department resigned at the same time, and it happened to be related to the expedition team?” Zhou Wen naturally refused to believe that there was no connection.</p>
<p>“Let’s wait for the results of the investigation. It’s very easy to make wrong judgments without any evidence.” An Sheng paused before saying, “Young Master Wen, Madam wishes that you visit.”</p>
<p>“What’s happened?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“It’s not a big deal. Madam just wants to introduce a girlfriend to you,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be taken aback. I’m still schooling. Why would Sis Lan think of introducing a girlfriend to me?</p>
<p>An Sheng smiled and said, “There’s nothing we can do about that. Madam previously arranged a blind date for Overseer, but he made it uncomfortable for everyone. Madam has already given up on him. She plans to place all her hopes on you.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen broke out into a cold sweat. “Help me tell Sis Lan that I probably won’t be able to return any time soon.”</p>
<p>An Sheng said, “Actually, I think the girl Madam is introducing is pretty good. Not only is she smart, but she’s also very reasonable. Her background isn’t bad, and she’s beautiful…”</p>
<p>“I’ll consider it when I need it…” Zhou Wen said helplessly.</p>
<p>“I think you should come back,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“I really can’t go back. I still have something to do. Let’s talk about it another day.” Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to return. He wasn’t in the mood to consider such matters. The elder was still pursuing him. Who knew when he would catch up. When that happened, the people around Zhou Wen would probably be implicated.</p>
<p>How can I finish off a Terror-grade expert? Zhou Wen thought about it and couldn’t come up with a good solution.</p>
<p>Although I have many Companion Beasts, none of them are at the Terror grade. It’s impossible for me to kill that elder. Only the Terror grade can deal with the Terror grade… Wait… Although I don’t have a Terror-grade Companion Beast… It doesn’t mean that there’s no Terror grade that can deal with him… Zhou Wen seemed to think of an idea.</p>
<h3 id='chapter886'>Chapter 886: Deer Terrace Pavilion’s Lower Level</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was considering how to deal with the old alchemist, his phone suddenly rang. He picked it up and saw that it was Ouyang Lan.</p>
<p>Having had An Sheng’s warning, Zhou Wen roughly knew why Ouyang Lan was calling him, but he had no choice but to answer.</p>
<p>“Little Wen, where have you been? Why haven’t I seen you recently?” Ouyang Lan asked.</p>
<p>“I’ve been to the Zhang family’s auction. I’m on my way back now,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“How many days has it been? Let’s not talk about participating in the Zhang family’s auction. Even if you went overseas, you should be back by now, right?” Ouyang Lan curled her lips and said.</p>
<p>“I planned on visiting a friend’s place on the way,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Friend? Male or female?” Ouyang Lan immediately asked.</p>
<p>“Male,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“What’s so nice about a man? Come back quickly. I’ll introduce you to a girl. She’s not bad. If you miss this opportunity, there won’t be another.” Ouyang Lan praised the girl. She made it sound as though Zhou Wen would suffer a huge loss if he didn’t marry her.</p>
<p>“Sis Lan, I really can’t come back any time soon.” Zhou Wen had no choice but to find an excuse.</p>
<p>“I don’t care. You have to come back on the 16th of this month. I helped you arrange a meeting with her. Just do it for me and meet her. If you really don’t like her, I won’t force you.” Ouyang Lan had steeled her heart to hook Zhou Wen up on a blind date.</p>
<p>“I’ll try my best to return.” Zhou Wen had no choice but to brush her off.</p>
<p>“I don’t want you to try your best. You have to.” Ouyang Lan changed the topic and said, “By the way, you can’t accept the challenge from Uesugi Nao. We don’t know what abilities and Companion Beasts the overseas people have. What if something happens? I’m still hoping that you can give me a grandchild.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s face darkened. “Don’t worry. I definitely won’t accept the challenge.”</p>
<p>After Ouyang Lan finally hung up, Zhou Wen heaved a long sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Looking at his itinerary, Zhou Wen felt that he should be able to make it back to Luoyang on the 16th. After some thought, he decided to return.</p>
<p>Firstly, he didn’t want to disappoint Ouyang Lan and didn’t want to embarrass her. Secondly, Zhou Wen needed to return as well.</p>
<p>With his abilities, he couldn’t kill the old alchemist. It looked like Banana Fairy wouldn’t be able to evolve anytime soon. He had to think of another way to eliminate the old alchemist.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Zhou Wen felt like there was a ticking time bomb hanging over his head. It made him uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen planned on luring the old alchemist to Chess Mountain. He might be able to get him and The Thearch to suffer a mutually destructive fight.</p>
<p>Of course, this was only Zhou Wen’s fantasy. In reality, the execution involved many difficulties. The Thearch might not be willing to be used by him.</p>
<p>If it were in the past, there really wasn’t much I could do. However, now that I have the Earth Elemental Beast, I can directly escape into Chess Mountain. Even if The Thearch doesn’t want to help, she can’t tolerate others wreaking havoc in Chess Mountain, right? Zhou Wen rode the Great Might Vajra Bull back and returned to revise Chess Mountain’s instance dungeon.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen had the Earth Elemental Beast. He wanted to see if he could use it to enter Chess Mountain and the lower levels of Deer Terrace Pavilion.</p>
<p>After entering the game, Zhou Wen didn’t wait for the flower to open the path into the mountain before riding the Earth Elemental Beast in.</p>
<p>After arriving at Deer Terrace Pavilion, Zhou Wen killed all the dimensional creatures inside. Finally, he used the Earth Elemental Beast to attempt to enter the treasure vault beneath Deer Terrace Pavilion.</p>
<p>The Earth Elemental Beast was indeed very useful. It led Zhou Wen past the foundation of Deer Terrace Pavilion and quickly arrived in a room. There was a large amount of gold, silver, and jewelry in the room, piled up like a hill.</p>
<p>These treasures were nothing to Zhou Wen. Furthermore, he couldn’t take out the items in-game, so he couldn’t be bothered to take a look. He pushed open the door and walked out of the room, continuing his search through the passageway outside.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen discovered another room. This time, he pushed it open and saw that there was no gold, silver, or jewelry inside. Instead, there was a huge wild boar sleeping inside.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar’s pushing open of the door immediately stirred the huge boar. It glared at him and got up to charge at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth and got it to rush forward to finish the boar.</p>
<p>Although the wild boar was very strong, it was clearly much weaker than Tyrant Behemoth. Soon, its skull was shattered by the Tyrant.</p>
<p>‘Killed Mythical creature, Pig Demon.’</p>
<p>Nothing dropped, leaving Zhou Wen somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>The interior of Deer Terrace Pavilion was like a huge maze with many rooms. Some of the rooms had dimensional creatures or treasures, but most of the rooms had nothing.</p>
<p>Previously, when I entered this place in reality, the environment there was somewhat different from here. It should be at the bottom of the foundation. Zhou Wen rode the Earth Elemental Beast and made it use Earth Escape to continue heading down.</p>
<p>Splash!</p>
<p>After the Earth Elemental Beast escaped, it fell into water. On careful look, it was a canal in the palace.</p>
<p>Back when I entered this place in reality, I swam in from the canal. I’m probably not far from that area now. Zhou Wen looked around and didn’t find any dimensional creatures. There weren’t any important areas nearby either. Zhou Wen continued swimming upstream, hoping to find an area similar to the one in reality.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen still remembered that there were many high-level dimensional crystals here. Perhaps there were many divine skill crystals.</p>
<p>He followed the canal to another room. The scene he saw delighted him. Although he had never been here before, there were many dimensional crystals piled on the stone platform in the room. It was like a small mountain.</p>
<p>As he was in-game, Zhou Wen could easily see the stats of the dimensional crystals. Most of them were at the Epic stage, but there were quite a number of Mythical ones. Zhou Wen had already seen a few of the 70-80 stat crystals, including Mythical Essence Energy Skill Crystals.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen soon noticed a strange dimensional creature lying on the mountain-like dimensional crystal.</p>
<p>It was a leopard-shaped dimensional creature. It had already stood up and was glaring at the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen decided to strike first. He summoned Tyrant Behemoth and charged at the dimensional creature.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth was indeed a top existence at the Mythical stage. It finished off the leopard-shaped dimensional creature with a single punch.</p>
<p>These are all mine… Zhou Wen looked at the dimensional crystals on the ground and had the urge to laugh out loud.</p>
<p>However, on careful thought, unless he absorbed the crystals himself, he couldn’t take them away. It seemed like his joy was a little premature.</p>
<h3 id='chapter887'>Chapter 887: Xu Ai</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>In the An family in Luoyang, Ouyang Lan pulled a girl and said, “Little Ai, stay here for a few more days. Don’t be in a rush to return.”</p>
<p>“That’s not too good, right?” Xu Ai said hesitantly.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with that? Your mother and I were childhood friends. If your mother hadn’t gone so far away with her husband, I would have long taken you as my goddaughter. We are family, so you can rest assured and stay here. If you were to come to Luoyang and still stay outside, I really couldn’t face meeting your mother,” Ouyang Lan said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Sis Lan, I won’t stand on ceremony then,” Xu Ai said.</p>
<p>“Child, what’s there to be polite with me? Stay here for now. When Little Wen returns, I’ll introduce you to him. You are about the same age, so you should have something in common,” Ouyang Lan said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Is Zhou Wen Uncle Lingfeng’s son?” Xu Ai asked.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan nodded. “Although he’s Lingfeng’s son, his personality is completely different. He’s just too shy…”</p>
<p>After Xu Ai left, Ouyang Lan asked An Sheng, who was beside her, “Ah Sheng, what do you think of Little Ai and Little Wen? I think Little Ai is pretty good. She’s quite compatible with Little Wen.”</p>
<p>An Sheng thought for a moment and said, “Miss Xu is Old Master Xu’s daughter. The Xu family doesn’t have a son and only has two daughters. I heard that Xu Ai is especially doted on by Old Master Xu. Will they let her marry out?”</p>
<p>“Madam Xu and I are childhood friends. They are worried about Xu Ai marrying off to someone else’s family, but would they be worried about marrying into my family? You don’t have to worry about that. Just tell me if you think they are suitable,” Ouyang Lan said.</p>
<p>“Miss Xu is knowledgeable, gentle, and virtuous. She’s also very smart, so she’s naturally an excellent candidate,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan glared at An Sheng. “Why are you beating around the bush when you’re talking to me? Do you think there’s something wrong with Xu Ai’s personality?”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>An Sheng shook his head and said, “That’s not it. I just think that Miss Xu is a little too smart. I wonder if she can get along easily with a simple-minded person like Young Master Wen.”</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan said with a smile, “You don’t understand. It’s best to find a smart and scheming woman. With Little Wen’s straightforward personality, it’ll be impossible for him to coax a woman. It’ll probably be very difficult to find a silly woman. However, for a smart and sensible woman like Xu Ai, as long as she’s willing, she will think of a way to get Little Wen to coax her. Only then can they live on happily.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Madam, you’re right,” An Sheng echoed.</p>
<p>“When Little Wen comes back, let them meet first. I think Little Ai is quite a nice child.” Ouyang Lan thought for a moment and said, “We should have someone there, right?”</p>
<p>“We do,” An Sheng answered.</p>
<p>“Then let them investigate what hobbies Xu Ai usually has. It will also allow Little Wen to understand her better,” Ouyang Lan said.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll do it now.” An Sheng naturally understood that what Ouyang Lan wanted him to investigate wasn’t as simple as Xu Ai’s hobbies. Therefore, he didn’t dare be negligent.</p>
<p>The next morning, Xu Ai went to Luoyang’s dimensional zone. Her personal female guard followed her.</p>
<p>“Miss, we have successfully entered the An family. Should we act according to plan?” the female guard whispered when they arrived at an uninhabited spot in the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>“Don’t be anxious. Don’t be fooled by Ouyang Lan’s appearance. She won’t believe us so easily. We can’t rush this matter. Let’s stay in the An family for a while,” Xu Ai said.</p>
<p>“But Ouyang Lan seems to be trying to matchmake you with that Zhou Wen. That’s not very nice, right?” the female guard said.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing bad about it. If I’m unwilling, Ouyang Lan can’t force me, right? Besides, I want to meet Zhou Wen. I want to know what kind of person he is, considering he has caused so much trouble in the Federation alone,” Xu Ai said.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“It’s best to be careful. According to the information we obtained, the Xia family has suffered greatly because of him. The Cape family and the Family Clan of Gods seem to have suffered quite a blow because of him. It’s best not to come into contact with such a person if possible to prevent your identity from being exposed,” the female guard said.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. It won’t be exposed. No one will expect that the Xu family’s second daughter, Xu Ai, is the master of the Great Skyfiend, Uesugi Nao,” Xu Ai said indifferently.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“In short, it’s better to be careful. After all, we aren’t overseas. Also, Miss, you are now the Xu family’s second daughter, Xu Ai. Don’t mention the other name in the Federation,” the female guard reminded again.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“I know.” Xu Ai nodded and didn’t say anything else.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen traveled, he used his phone to explore Deer Terrace Pavilion. The space beneath Deer Terrace Pavilion was much bigger than he imagined. He encountered several Mythical creatures inside, but unfortunately, none of them dropped Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>He found quite a number of dimensional crystals, but not many could be used.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen’s situation was rather awkward. He couldn’t absorb the Mythical dimensional crystals, and even if he could, they were useless.</p>
<p>Epic crystals were no longer of much use to him, so despite having so many dimensional crystals, he actually didn’t need much.</p>
<p>“Since I can’t use it myself, you guys are lucking out.” Zhou Wen summoned his main Companion Beasts, such as Tyrant Behemoth, Demonic Neonate, and the like. He got them to choose crystals and eat whatever they wanted.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen planned on seeing if the crystals here would respawn the next time he came. If they could, he would really be rich.</p>
<p>Explosive Fiend Man and Doctor Darkness were very interested in some of the Essence Energy Skill Crystals, but Demonic Neonate remained the same. The Mystical crystals were unable to move her. She usually only ate the Longevity Fruits, and there weren’t many of them left.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth and Truth Listener weren’t picky with food. As long as they could provide energy, they would directly swallow most crystals.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen constantly searched Deer Terrace Pavilion. Apart from searching for the treasures there, he also wanted to see if he could find The Thearch’s true body.</p>
<p>He refused to believe that The Thearch was that flower.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen returned to Luoyang, he still couldn’t find The Thearch’s true body under Deer Terrace Pavilion. The interior of Deer Terrace Pavilion was just too complicated. Zhou Wen had explored less than half of it.</p>
<p>According to the parts he had explored, Zhou Wen felt that there was definitely a Terror-grade existence inside Deer Terrace Pavilion. This was because he had already seen six Mythical dimensional creatures inside.</p>
<p>For dimensional zones like the Metalwork Temple, there was only one Mythical creature in the entire dimensional zone. Now, there were more than ten Mythical creatures found in the ancient buildings in Deer Terrace Pavilion. This was just too terrifying. It was definitely not something ordinary dimensional zones could compare with.</p>
<p>After returning to Luoyang, Zhou Wen planned on returning to school, but on the way, he suddenly saw a cube light up on the street. A Companion Beast had issued a challenge, so he took Ya’er to take a look.</p>
<p>“Coach, when did you return?” Just as Zhou Wen arrived near the cube, Feng Qiuyan, Sadie, and Gulli saw him. They waved as they squeezed over.</p>
<h3 id='chapter888'>Chapter 888: Too Weak</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“I just arrived in Luoyang. I haven’t even managed to return to campus.” Zhou Wen stood to the side when he saw that it was Feng Qiuyan and company.</p>
<p>“Coach, look at those two Companion Beasts. Which one of them can win?” Gulli often heard Feng Qiuyan call him Coach, and now, he was also very comfortable with addressing him the same way.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I’ve never seen these two Companion Beasts before,” Zhou Wen said with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>“You can make a guess even if you haven’t seen it before. With your standards, you should be close to the mark just by looking,” Gulli said with a smile.</p>
<p>Gulli’s words were a little exaggerated, attracting the attention of others.</p>
<p>Xu Ai, who wasn’t far away, heard Gulli’s words and turned to look at Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>Are all Federation students so arrogant and conceited? Xu Ai thought to herself. She sized up Zhou Wen and company and didn’t pay much attention to them. She only imagined that they were a group of students bragging.</p>
<p>She had seen Zhou Wen’s information and photo before coming, but back then, he was wearing Sunset College’s uniform and looked very spirited.</p>
<p>Now that Zhou Wen had been on the run for so many days, he didn’t have the time to groom himself. He looked a little sloven and his condition made him look older than his actual age. Furthermore, he had Ya’er in his arms. Those who didn’t know him would think that he was a young father who didn’t know how to take care of his daughter.</p>
<p>Therefore, Xu Ai didn’t think of Zhou Wen immediately. She only believed that Zhou Wen was Feng Qiuyan and company’s tutor.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the challenger and the challenged. The challenged was a Thunderbird, and the one challenging the Thunderbird was a Windthunder Raven. Both of them had lightning attributes and were birds. They were considered relatively similar Mythical pets.</p>
<p>“They both have lightning-elemental powers. The Windthunder Raven also has wind-elemental powers. Its speed is also faster than the Thunderbird. I think the chances of the Windthunder Raven winning are higher. Coach, what do you think?” Gulli said again.</p>
<p>“I think the Thunderbird will win,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Why?” Gulli asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn’t only Gulli who was puzzled. Xu Ai, who had heard their conversation, thought otherwise. She also believed that the Windthunder Raven would win.</p>
<p>As the Windthunder Raven was an overseas Companion Beast, Xu Ai was very familiar with it. The Windthunder Raven had the power of wind and lightning. It was somewhat different from pure lightning-elemental beasts. It could even be said to restrain pure lightning. Therefore, although Xu Ai didn’t know much about the Thunderbird, she still felt that the Windthunder Raven had a higher chance of winning.</p>
<p>Since Zhou Wen was so certain that the Thunderbird would win, Xu Ai naturally thought nothing of it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the Thunderbird on the screen and said, “That’s because that Thunderbird has the aura of inevitable victory. When meeting face to face, the bravest wins. If the difference in strength between the Thunderbird and the Windthunder Raven isn’t too great, the Thunderbird will definitely win.”</p>
<p>“So it’s because of the aura,” Feng Qiuyan said as he fell into deep thought, as though he had understood something.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, there’s no way to place a bet here. Otherwise, I would place my bet on Thunderbird’s victory and earn some pocket money,” Gulli said regretfully.</p>
<p>To think that such a person can be a tutor at Sunset College. From the looks of it, Sunset College doesn’t deserve its reputation. When Xu Ai heard their words, she stopped paying attention to them. She felt that Zhou Wen was spouting nonsense. If he could determine victory based solely on aura, what was the point of having strength?</p>
<p>As the few of them conversed, the battle between the Thunderbird and the Windthunder Raven had already begun. The Windthunder Raven immediately launched an attack. Its flying speed was extremely fast, and with the sound of wind and thunder accompanying it, it was much faster than the Thunderbird.</p>
<p>After using its speed to bypass the Thunderbird’s line of sight, the Windthunder Raven launched a violent bombardment. With a flap of its wings, wind and lightning transformed into blades of light that attacked the Thunderbird from behind like a storm. The Windthunder Blades that filled the sky blocked the Thunderbird’s path.</p>
<p>The Thunderbird had no intention of retreating. Lightning surged from its body as it faced the storm.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Lightning flashed and thunder crackled as the wind blades shattered. Sparks flew as the Thunderbird went against the wind, piercing through the wind blades that filled the sky and rushing in front of the Windthunder Raven.</p>
<p>The Windthunder Raven wanted to use its speed to dodge the Thunderbird’s attack before counterattacking.</p>
<p>However, to everyone’s surprise, the Thunderbird charged forward without any hesitation. It didn’t dodge the Windthunder Raven’s Windthunder Blades at all. It would rather suffer some injuries to forcefully close the distance.</p>
<p>Although the Windthunder Raven was faster, it could only dodge under the pressure of the Thunderbird. As for the Thunderbird, it became braver as it charged. The lightning on its body condensed as it streaked across the sky in the shape of a bird. If it managed a hit, even the hardest steel would probably explode.</p>
<p>In the beginning, the Windthunder Raven could still use its speed to dodge, but as the lightning powers on the Thunderbird grew stronger, its flying speed also increased. It was very difficult for the Windthunder Raven to dodge the Thunderbird’s attacks.</p>
<p>Before long, the owner of the Windthunder Raven saw that there was no chance of victory, so he directly admitted defeat and retracted it.</p>
<p>“As expected of Coach. You have keen eyes.” Gulli gave him a thumbs up.</p>
<p>Xu Ai thought otherwise. She didn’t believe that Zhou Wen had determined the victor based on aura. She thought to herself, If it wasn’t for his good luck, he would have long known the abilities of the Thunderbird and Windthunder Raven. That’s why he made such a judgment.</p>
<p>After watching the battle, Xu Ai was about to leave when she suddenly heard Sadie ask Zhou Wen, “Coach, what do you think of Great Skyfiend that’s ranked first?”</p>
<p>Upon hearing Sadie’s words, Xu Ai couldn’t help but slow down. Her ears pricked up as she felt a little smug. These people from the Federation should be afraid of Great Skyfiend’s invincibility and strength, right?</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Sadie thought for a moment and said, “Coach, do you think Great Skyfiend can maintain first place until the end of the ranking battle?”</p>
<p>“No,” Zhou Wen answered directly.</p>
<p>“Why?” Sadie asked in surprise when she saw Zhou Wen’s straightforward answer.</p>
<p>“Because it’s too weak,” Zhou Wen answered truthfully.</p>
<p>He had seen too many powerful Guardians. If one couldn’t reach the Terror grade, they were naturally weak in Zhou Wen’s opinion. It was impossible for it to obtain first place, and Great Skyfiend clearly hadn’t reached the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Too… weak… When Xu Aai heard this, she nearly exploded from anger. If this were overseas, she wouldn’t hesitate to summon Great Skyfiend to let Zhou Wen know how terrifying the so-called weak Guardian was.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this was the Federation. Xu Ai could only endure it. She thought to herself, I can’t lower myself to the level of these ignorant Federation people.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s answer, Gulli gave him a thumbs up and said, “Sis, aren’t you asking an unnecessary question? In front of Coach, Great Skyfiend or whatever is definitely weak. Unfortunately, pure humans can’t participate in the battle. Otherwise, if Coach were to go up, he would be able to beat up the Great Skyfiend and Uesugi Nao to a pulp. They’d kneel and call him daddy.”</p>

<h3 id='chapter889'>Chapter 889: Three Immortal Swords</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>I’ll bear with it… I’ll bear with it… The corners of Xu Ai’s eyes twitched as she felt like killing someone.</p>
<p>However, this was the Federation, and Xu Ai had a special mission. She couldn’t expose her identity, so she forcefully resisted the urge to slap Gulli.</p>
<p>“Are you heading back to campus?” Zhou Wen asked Gulli and company.</p>
<p>“Yes, let’s go together.” The few of them returned to school.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan was well-informed. Zhou Wen had just returned to school when he received a call from her asking him to have dinner with her.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen agreed. It had been a long time since he had seen Zhou Lingfeng and Ouyang Lan. He could take the opportunity to meet them while eating.</p>
<p>He changed Ya’er into new clothes and took her along.</p>
<p>However, when he arrived, Zhou Wen realized that Zhou Lingfeng wasn’t around. Apart from Ouyang Lan, there was a girl who looked to be in her twenties.</p>
<p>The girl was naturally Uesugi Nao, who had impersonated as Xu Ai. She was slightly taken aback when she saw Zhou Wen and Ya’er. Only then did she recognize that Zhou Wen was the fellow who had said that Great Skyfiend was too weak.</p>
<p>“Come, Little Wen, let me introduce you. This is my childhood friend’s daughter, Xu Ai…” Ouyang Lan pulled Zhou Wen to sit beside her.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan didn’t deliberately make Zhou Wen sit beside Xu Ai because she knew him too well. She knew that Zhou Wen didn’t know how to chat with girls, so he wouldn’t say anything if she made him sit beside Xu Ai.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Little Ai, this is Ya’er, an orphan that Zhou Wen adopted. Although he looks cold, he’s actually very caring.” Ouyang Lan explained Ya’er’s origins and beautified Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Such caring people are rare in such an environment,” Xu Ai said with a smile.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Not only is my Little Wen compassionate, but he’s also talented. He can master anything he picks up…” Ouyang Lan’s praises of Zhou Wen made him blush.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, I heard that your cultivation talent is extremely high. Even the peers of the six families are far inferior to you. I wonder if you can teach me?” Xu Ai said to Zhou Wen with a smile.</p>
<p>“I don’t…” Before Zhou Wen could finish his sentence, Ouyang Lan interrupted him.</p>
<p>When Ouyang Lan heard Zhou Wen’s opening, she knew that he wanted to say that he didn’t have the time. She knew Zhou Wen too well, so she didn’t hesitate to say, “It’s still early. After dinner, you young adults can head out for a walk. If you have any cultivation questions, feel free to ask Little Wen. He’s an absolute genius in this aspect.”</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan thought to herself that it wasn’t easy to find a girl that wasn’t frightened away by Zhou Wen and was willing to understand him. She felt that she couldn’t let go of this opportunity.</p>
<p>She was really worried that with Zhou Wen’s personality, he wouldn’t be able to find a wife in the future.</p>
<p>“Ya’er, can the beautiful Sis Lan take you out to play?” After the meal, Ouyang Lan wanted to take Ya’er away to prevent Ya’er from interfering with their interaction.</p>
<p>Ya’er turned her head and leaned her face on Zhou Wen’s shoulder, completely ignoring Ouyang Lan.</p>
<p>“It’s fine, Sis Lan. I’ll take her. She’s afraid of strangers,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“You’ll spoil her like this.” Ouyang Lan was helpless. Although she had a sharp tongue, she couldn’t bear to forcefully take Ya’er away. All she could do was let Ya’er follow Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Sis Lan, I like children too. I’ll take care of her. Don’t worry,” Xu Ai said.</p>
<p>“Then I’m relieved.” Ouyang Lan couldn’t help but praise Xu Ai for being sensible.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Xu Ai left the restaurant together. Seeing that Zhou Wen wasn’t speaking, Xu Ai took the initiative to say, “Zhou Wen, I have some questions regarding cultivation that I would like to ask you. Is it convenient to go to the training grounds?”</p>
<p>“Sure.” Zhou Wen saw that it was still early. Furthermore, Ouyang Lan had already agreed for him to help. It wouldn’t be appropriate for him to leave, so he nodded.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen agree, a crafty glint flashed in Xu Ai’s eyes as she thought to herself, I’ll let you know today what it means by there’s always someone better. Let’s see if you dare be arrogant in the future. You actually dare say that Great Skyfiend is too weak. I’ll let you know who’s too weak later.</p>
<p>The reason she had taken the initiative to ask Zhou Wen out was naturally not to build a good relationship with him.</p>
<p>The target of Uesugi Nao’s visit wasn’t Zhou Wen, but the An family’s weapon factory and the new Essence Energy weapons the An family researched. These had nothing to do with Zhou Wen, so she didn’t need to deliberately approach him.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for Zhou Wen’s evaluation of Great Skyfiend and Gulli’s words in front of the cube, she would probably have politely eaten with Zhou Wen and never taken the initiative to ask him out again in the future.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s thoughts were even simpler. He wasn’t interested in Xu Ai. Furthermore, there was still the problem of the alchemist that hadn’t been resolved. He wasn’t in the mood to think about anything else.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for Sis Lan, Zhou Wen would have returned to grind dungeons.</p>
<p>The two of them had their own thoughts and soon, they arrived at a nearby training ground.</p>
<p>Xu Ai didn’t want anyone to see them, so she paid for a private training room. Soon, the staff took them in.</p>
<p>“What do you need me to teach you?” Zhou Wen asked Xu Ai.</p>
<p>These words sounded awkward to Xu Ai’s ears. She thought to herself, You really think too highly of yourself. If you want to teach me, teach me in your next life. In a while, you will know who’s teaching who.</p>
<p>Xu Ai’s thoughts didn’t show on her face. She looked at Zhou Wen with a smile and said, “Do you know sword techniques? I’ve been practicing a sword technique recently, but no matter how much I practice, I can’t grasp the key point. I want you to help me see what’s wrong.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“A little. How about this? Demonstrate the sword technique for me first. I’ll try to see if I can find the problem,” Zhou Wen said seriously.</p>
<p>He didn’t know that Xu Ai had other intentions and thought that she really wanted to seek his help. He felt that it was fine to help her. After all, she was the daughter of Sister Lan’s childhood friend.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll demonstrate it first. Help me take a look. If there’s anything wrong, just say. There’s no need to worry.” After Xu Ai said that, she took a sword from the rack and stood in the middle of the training grounds.</p>
<p>She naturally wouldn’t let Zhou Wen guide her in her sword practice. Not only was the sword technique she demonstrated without a problem, but it was also very profound.</p>
<p>This sword technique was named “Three Immortal Swords.” It was obtained by Uesugi Nao in a mysterious dimensional zone overseas. She was the only person in the world who knew the Three Immortal Swords. Furthermore, she had never displayed it to outsiders before.</p>
<p>Now that she was demonstrating the Three Immortal Swords, the practice sword in her hand drew a profound trajectory. It looked like a casual move, but in fact, it was very profound.</p>
<p>Back when Uesugi Nao practiced the Three Immortal Swords herself, she had put in a lot of hard work. After a year of arduous cultivation, she had finally mastered the Three Immortal Swords and comprehended the sword intent of the Three Immortal Swords.</p>
<p>2</p>
<h3 id='chapter890'>Chapter 890: Your Sword Art Is Very Problematic</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The most difficult part of the Three Immortal Swords was the three forces delivered with one strike. It was hard and soft at the same time. It had three different ways of utilizing the forces and three different concepts.</p>
<p>One needed to combine the three forces and concepts ingeniously to be able to use the Three Immortal Swords well. If they didn’t do it well, not only would they fail to achieve the effect of defeating the enemy, but they would only fall flat on their face. It would be a good outcome if they weren’t injured, much less injure the enemy.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao had trained for so long to master the Three Immortal Swords. How could someone who had never seen the Three Immortal Swords teach her?</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao’s goal for demonstrating this sword technique was to embarrass Zhou Wen. She wanted to let him know who was truly weak.</p>
<p>As no one had seen the Three Immortals Swords, Uesugi Nao wasn’t afraid of being recognized.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know that so many thoughts were running through Uesugi Nao’s head. He only believed that Uesugi Nao was really asking him for advice, so he watched very seriously as he searched for anything amiss with the Three Immortal Swords.</p>
<p>Soon, Uesugi Nao finished demonstrating the Three Immortal Swords. Then, she looked at Zhou Wen and asked with a smile, “Do you need me to demonstrate again?”</p>
<p>“Alright,” Zhou Wen said with a nod.</p>
<p>A smile appeared on Uesugi Nao’s face before she demonstrated the sword art again. However, she thought to herself, Forget about demonstrating it once. Even if I demonstrate it a hundred times, you won’t be able to understand it.</p>
<p>Unlike straightforward and domineering sword arts, the Three Immortal Swords were mainly about the use of force and concepts. These non-superficial things couldn’t be understood just by looking at the sword moves.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao had already made up her mind. After this round, she asked Zhou Wen if he wanted her to demonstrate again. If Zhou Wen overestimated himself and wanted to watch it a third time, she would directly ask Zhou Wen if he had found any problems after three rounds of demonstrations.</p>
<p>If you know what’s good for you, you should admit early that you can’t tell anything. That way, you wouldn’t be so embarrassed, Uesugi Nao thought.</p>
<p>Soon, Uesugi Nao demonstrated the Three Immortal Swords again. After stopping, she held the practice sword and asked Zhou Wen with a smile, “Do you want me to demonstrate again?”</p>
<p>“There’s no need.” Zhou Wen shook his head.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao thought to herself, At least you have some self-awareness. If I were to demonstrate it a third time and you couldn’t see anything, it would only be even more embarrassing.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao smiled at Zhou Wen, waiting for him to bow his head to her and admit that he couldn’t tell anything.</p>
<p>“There’s indeed a huge problem with your sword art.” However, Zhou Wen’s words left Uesugi Nao stunned.</p>
<p>“Oh, tell me. What’s the problem with my sword art?” Uesugi Nao looked at Zhou Wen with a faint smile. She imagined that Zhou Wen was just trying to put on a front.</p>
<p>From Uesugi Nao’s point of view, Zhou Wen’s actions would only embarrass him further.</p>
<p>“There’s a very serious problem with your sword art. The sword art you practice is incomplete,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“The sword art I’m practicing is actually incomplete?” Uesugi Nao pretended to be surprised, but she was sneering inwardly. Not complete my ass. The Three Immortals Sword Art is complete. I’ve already mastered it completely, yet you still dare to say it’s incomplete. Keep making up lies. Let’s see what you can come up with.</p>
<p>“Yes, the sword art is indeed incomplete. It’s also possible that you failed to grasp the essence of the sword art when you were practicing. You failed to draw inferences and comprehend the true meaning of the sword art,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I see. Then can you give me some pointers on the true meaning of this sword art?” Uesugi Nao looked at Zhou Wen and teased him.</p>
<p>She was already so well-versed with the Three Immortal Swords to the point of being able to use them in reverse, but Zhou Wen had actually said that she hadn’t understood its true meaning. All Uesugi Nao wanted to know was how Zhou Wen was going to continue making up stories.</p>
<p>“Give me the sword.” Zhou Wen extended his hand in front of Uesugi Nao.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao handed the practice sword to Zhou Wen before standing to the side with her arms crossed. She waited to watch Zhou Wen’s clumsy performance. Now, she was somewhat curious as to how Zhou Wen had managed to smooth over his ridiculous words.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen got Ya’er to stand by the side and walked to the center of the training grounds with the practice sword in hand. He said, “This sword art of yours has three uses of force and concepts. You have already used the three types of force and concepts very well. However, your method isn’t right, so you are only stuck at that stage. There’s no way to improve further and master a complete sword art.”</p>
<p>To be able to tell that the Three Immortal Swords is a combination of three forces and concepts, this Zhou Wen isn’t completely blind, thought Uesugi Nao.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s attitude still displeased her. Therefore, she asked with a faint smile, “Then how can I improve further and master a complete sword art?”</p>
<p>“That’s not difficult.” The practice sword in Zhou Wen’s hand began moving. The sword moves he released were actually Uesugi Nao’s Three Immortal Swords.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao was surprised that Zhou Wen could use the sword moves of the Three Immortal Swords. Although he had only used one force, he was still able to produce the corresponding sword intent. She was already rather surprised and couldn’t help but raise her opinion of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“This is the first force and concept of the sword art,” Zhou Wen said as he used another move. It was the Three Immortal Swords sword move that Uesugi Nao had used. This time, Zhou Wen’s sword move contained the two forces and concepts of hardness and softness.</p>
<p>This surprised Uesugi Nao. To be able to use both hard and soft forces in one strike at the same time, she had practiced for nearly a month back then to master it.</p>
<p>“According to Daoist teachings, the so-called ‘one begets two’ can be seen as Chaos giving birth to Yin and Yang, or it can be said to be a division of hardness and softness.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he struck out with his sword. It was still the sword move of the Three Immortal Swords, but this time, he had already used all three forces.</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao widened her eyes as she looked at Zhou Wen in disbelief. She secretly suspected, Could it be that Zhou Wen has also practiced the Three Immortals Sword Art in the past? That’s impossible. The Three Immortals Sword Art was engraved on the stone wall of the Three Cave Immortal. After I saw it, the stone wall was destroyed. How could Zhou Wen have learned the Three Immortals Sword Art?</p>
<p>“One begets two, two begets three, and three begets all things. Your sword art stopped at three and didn’t continue expanding. It’s like the basic colors of red, green, and blue. You can use the three primary colors, but when the three colors are combined, they can form an even richer and more colorful color, forming a colorful world. I don’t know if your sword art is incomplete or if it’s because you haven’t figured out the true meaning of the sword art, but it has stopped at the three primary colors realm. You haven’t been able to demonstrate the true meaning of the world of the sword…” Zhou Wen demonstrated as he spoke. As for Uesugi Nao, she was already dumbfounded. Her face was filled with shock and disbelief.</p>
<p>Four types… Five types… Six types… Uesugi Nao saw more and more types of sword intent in Zhou Wen’s sword technique, but they were extremely harmonious. It was as though the Three Immortals Sword Art was supposed to be exactly what he demonstrated.</p>
<p>The first time she heard what Zhou Wen said did seem to make sense, but Uesugi Nao felt a deep sense of helplessness. Even if she understood this principle, she didn’t have that many sword intents to fuse together.</p>
<h3 id='chapter891'>Chapter 891: Nine-Tailed Fox</h3>
<p>1</p>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Nine… Ten… Eleven… Is this fellow a monster? Uesugi Nao stared intently at Zhou Wen, feeling extremely shocked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen casually waved his hand and used more than ten sword intents. And at his age, how could he comprehend so many sword intents?</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s sword intents were naturally not something he had mastered himself. In fact, Zhou Wen had never practiced sword arts before. What he was truly good at was movement techniques. At most, he could add the Immortal Slaying move to his list.</p>
<p>These sword intents were what Zhou Wen had learned in the peach blossom mystic realm. The white-robed man’s sword art contained three thousand sword intents. This was just a drop in the ocean.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen hadn’t fully comprehended the three thousand sword intents, he had already memorized them. It wasn’t enough to use it against a true top-notch swordsman, but he could still use it casually.</p>
<p>“That’s the general problem. There’s nothing wrong with the rest. Go back and train slowly. I still have something on, so I’ll be leaving now.” Zhou Wen handed the practice sword back to Uesugi Nao before carrying Ya’er out of the training room.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao watched Zhou Wen leave. She was in a daze for a long time before coming to her senses. After the door to the training room closed, she snapped to her senses. Training… What training can I do… That’s not the Three Immortals Sword Art at all… There aren’t so many sword intent training methods in the Three Immortals Sword Art. What the hell am I to train with!</p>
<p>Although she said that, Uesugi Nao was still shocked by Zhou Wen’s sword art. To be able to casually unleash more than ten sword intents mixed together was something only a few top sword masters overseas could do.</p>
<p>“Miss, are you alright?” The female guard walked in. She had been secretly protecting Uesugi Nao, but with Zhou Wen around, she didn’t dare approach. She only came over after Zhou Wen left.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. From the looks of it, I’ve underestimated the young experts of the Federation. It’s indeed reasonable for Zhou Wen to be able to stir up such a storm in the Federation,” Uesugi Nao said.</p>
<p>“What happened?” the female guard asked.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. I’ve seen Zhou Wen’s sword art and it’s indeed very strong. Unfortunately, no matter how strong his sword art, it’s useless. Without a Guardian, humans will ultimately not be able to step into the stage of being a human god. No matter how strong his sword art, he’s only mortal.” Uesugi Nao slowly regained her confidence.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was strong, he was stuck below the Mythical stage. She had Great Skyfiend and was already in the Mythical stage. She still had the right to look down on him.</p>
<p>I can study the world of swords that Zhou Wen mentioned, Uesugi Nao thought.</p>
<p>“I’ve already said that a person like Zhou Wen definitely has something extraordinary about him,” the female guard said.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Uesugi Nao didn’t say anything else. She looked at the female guard and asked, “How’s the information I asked you to gather coming along? Did you find out who Tyrant Behemoth’s owner is?”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing for now. Our men are already investigating,” the female guard said.</p>
<p>“Find him as soon as possible. I must avenge the slaying of Orochi,” Uesugi Nao said.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Zhou Wen returned to his dorm and began grinding again. Now, he only wanted to quickly figure out the Chess Mountain dungeon. If the alchemist came to him again, he could lure the alchemist to Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>The interior of Deer Terrace Pavilion was bigger than Zhou Wen had imagined. As he needed to explore it, it wasn’t like he could directly use Earth Escape. He wouldn’t know what he might miss in the middle.</p>
<p>After entering Deer Terrace Pavilion again, Zhou Wen continued exploring.</p>
<p>Not long after, an arched door suddenly appeared in front of Zhou Wen. After passing through the arch, there was a huge space inside.</p>
<p>This space looked like the interior of a tower. There were arched doors all around, and there was water flowing in many of them.</p>
<p>The bottom of this space was occupied by water, like a huge circular pool. And in the middle was a huge bronze tripod cauldron.</p>
<p>And inside the bronze tripod cauldron, there was a white fox. It was different from ordinary foxes. The fox had nine snow-white tails on its back.</p>
<p>As for its body, it was trapped by the chains that passed through the bronze tripod cauldron. It seemed to be imprisoned in the bronze tripod cauldron.</p>
<p>Is that… a nine-tailed fox? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but recall the legend of Deer Terrace Pavilion—the peerless demon concubine who could topple kingdoms and bring disaster to the people.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Although the Nine-Headed Pheasant Spirit and Jade Lute Spirit were ranked equal, the first impression people had of a demon concubine was that of a nine-tailed fox. There wouldn’t be a second one.</p>
<p>Could she… be The Thearch? Zhou Wen was puzzled as he stared at the Nine-Tailed White Fox inside the bronze tripod cauldron.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the Nine-Tailed White Fox opened her eyes and looked in the direction of the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>They were fox’s eyes, but in Zhou Wen’s eyes, they were indescribably charming. It even made Zhou Wen feel tempted to run towards the white fox in the bronze tripod cauldron.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly focused.</p>
<p>He originally had the ability to focus. At that moment, he focused his mind and immediately regained his clarity. When he looked at the nine-tailed fox again, he didn’t feel anything.</p>
<p>However, the demonic glint in the nine-tailed fox’s eyes intensified. Perhaps due to the demonic glint in its eyes, the nine-tailed fox in Zhou Wen’s eyes gradually transformed into a beautiful woman in white.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen plenty of beauties, but he had never seen such a seductive woman. Her eyes seemed to hook onto people, as though any man in the world would be willing to die for her from the mere move of her gaze.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar walked towards the extremely seductive woman in a daze as though it had lost its soul. It seemed to only have eyes for the woman, unable to contain anything else.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar quickly walked to the bronze tripod cauldron and looked at the girl inside. Without any hesitation, it jumped in.</p>
<p>However, there was no white-robed woman in the bronze cauldron. It was clearly the evil and demonic Nine-Tailed White Fox. It opened its bloody mouth and bit at the blood-colored avatar’s head.</p>
<p>Just as the nine-tailed fox was about to bite the blood-colored avatar, the dazed blood-colored avatar suddenly flashed and dodged the fox’s bloody mouth. At the same time, an invisible sword beam slashed across the nine-tailed fox’s neck, dyeing the snow-white fur red.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself that it was a pity. As he had to pretend to be charmed by the nine-tailed fox, he couldn’t condense his Essence Energy ahead of time, so he couldn’t use Immortal Slaying. Otherwise, this strike might have beheaded the nine-tailed fox.</p>
<p>The nine-tailed fox was alarmed and furious. It found it unbelievable that its charm was useless against Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen was afraid of many things, but powers like bewitchment were useless against him. Previously, even the Lost Immortal Sutra couldn’t bewitch him, much less a nine-tailed fox.</p>
<h3 id='chapter892'>Chapter 892: Li Xuan’s Return</h3>
<p>1</p>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>The nine-tailed fox’s eyes suffused a demonic glint as its nine tails danced wildly. Essence Energy spewed out from its body like a volcanic eruption.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly summoned Tyrant Behemoth and got it to charge forward. However, when Tyrant Behemoth met the nine-tailed fox’s eyes, it was immediately charmed by it. It turned around and charged at the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly dodged and retreated as Tyrant Behemoth chased after him.</p>
<p>Even a Mythical creature like Tyrant Behemoth can be bewitched? Zhou Wen turned his head to take a look. Thankfully, the nine-tailed fox was locked inside the bronze tripod cauldron and couldn’t chase after him.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth chased Zhou Wen for quite some time before the effects of the bewitchment on it gradually vanished. Zhou Wen regained control of it and unsummoned Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>I can resist the bewitchment myself, but my Companion Beasts can’t. From the looks of it, I can only personally kill that nine-tailed fox. Zhou Wen felt that the nine-tailed fox didn’t seem like The Thearch.</p>
<p>Even if The Thearch in-game wasn’t as intelligent as in real life, it wasn’t to the point of having such a low IQ. Furthermore, it felt like the nine-tailed fox’s abilities were somewhat different from The Thearch’s.</p>
<p>At the very least, the nine-tailed fox didn’t seem to have the ability to make wishes, nor did it have the invisible pressure of The Thearch.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen didn’t see the nine-tailed fox reveal its Terror state. If it used its Terror state, Zhou Wen’s strike probably wouldn’t be able to injure it.</p>
<p>After returning to the nine-tailed fox, Zhou Wen wore the Invisibility Cloak and activated its invisibility. He approached without the nine-tailed fox noticing him.</p>
<p>The Light Concealment Sword combined with the Immortal Slaying Sword cleaved off the nine-tailed fox’s head. The nine-tailed fox didn’t even have time to react.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, this nine-tailed fox can’t be The Thearch. Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed, but he suddenly realized that something was amiss.</p>
<p>The nine-tailed fox was already dead. Logically speaking, there should be a game notification, but there was no notification of him killing the nine-tailed fox.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>The chains that bound the nine-tailed fox automatically unshackled because it was dead.</p>
<p>However, after the chains were released, the nine-tailed fox’s corpse floated in the air as its head grew out again. As its nine tails swayed, its Essence Energy burned like flames. Wherever the flames passed, the nine-tailed fox’s body underwent a strange change. It gradually transformed from a fox into a beautiful woman in white palace robes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this white-robed woman’s body suffused a demonic glow. She looked like a ghost. This time, it wasn’t an illusion, but a woman.</p>
<p>‘Warning… Warning… Nine-Tailed Fox has entered a Terror form… Nine-Tailed Fox has entered a Terror form…’ A red warning popped up in the game.</p>
<p>Terror transformation! Zhou Wen turned around and ran without a word. He didn’t have the means to kill a Terror-grade opponent. If he didn’t run, he could only wait for death.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Invisibility Cloak’s effects were still present. The Nine-Tailed Fox couldn’t see Zhou Wen, allowing him to escape.</p>
<p>Although I can’t be sure if the Nine-Tailed Fox is The Thearch, if that alchemist pursues me again, I can lure him to it. Zhou Wen had seen the abilities of the Nine-Tailed Fox and had some ideas.</p>
<p>The strongest ability of the Nine-tailed Fox was still bewitchment, but bewitchment was useless against Zhou Wen. Therefore, in comparison, the Nine-Tailed Fox was a Terror-grade creature that Zhou Wen was least afraid of.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen avoided the location of the Nine-Tailed Fox and went to other places in Deer Terrace Pavilion to hunt dimensional creatures. However, no matter where he went, he would eventually reach the space where the Nine-Tailed Fox was.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, only by killing the Nine-Tailed Fox will I be able to reach the area behind. Zhou Wen could only temporarily give up on the idea of grinding Deer Terrace Pavilion.</p>
<p>After grinding all the dungeons that he could, he didn’t obtain much. When he was grinding the Ancient Sword Tomb, he discovered a Mythical ancient sword.</p>
<p>The ancient sword was wide and had extremely powerful destructive power. After killing it, he learned that it was named Great Destroyer. It was a Mythical sword, but unfortunately, it didn’t drop a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>After returning to Luoyang for a few days, he didn’t find any traces of the alchemist. This made Zhou Wen feel uneasy.</p>
<p>An Sheng had already gotten people to carry out surveillance, hoping to discover the alchemist before he entered Luoyang. Unfortunately, there was no news. It was unknown if he hadn’t come to Luoyang or if he had avoided all the surveillance.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Xuanwen Club’s training grounds.</p>
<p>“Your wise and mighty President has returned. Aren’t you very happy and surprised?” Li Xuan returned much earlier than expected.</p>
<p>According to Li Xuan, he had already learned most of Worm Dugu’s Gu nurturing techniques. All that was left was practice. He had found it boring and ran back alone.</p>
<p>Due to the pair of Ice Silkworms, Li Xuan’s combat strength was considered very strong. However, when he was in the Dugu family, Worm Dugu didn’t let him use the Ice Silkworms. He insisted that he fight all sorts of Gu, causing him to suffer quite a bit.</p>
<p>However, because of this, he had a deep understanding of Gu, and it had helped his growth tremendously.</p>
<p>“I realize that you seem to have become much more handsome recently?” Zhou Wen sized up Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Is that so?” Li Xuan stroked his chin and said smugly, “I’ve always been handsome. You just didn’t realize it in the past. There’s nothing to be alarmed about.”</p>
<p>“No, I really think you are much more handsome than before. Come, let me take a closer look.” Zhou Wen circled Li Xuan a few times and nodded in thought. “I see. I understand…”</p>
<p>“What do you understand?” Li Xuan asked curiously.</p>
<p>“I understand why you look so much more handsome,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Why?” Li Xuan hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“Because you…” Zhou Wen deliberately lowered his voice. When Li Xuan approached to hear him clearly, he punched him in the eye. “Because you haven’t suffered a beating in a long while.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Li Xuan immediately flew into a rage after being punched in the eye. “Zhou Wen, how dare you sneak an attack on me? You’re dead.”</p>
<p>Seeing Li Xuan rush over, Zhou Wen summoned the Defy Ancient Sovereign Life Soul and fused it with himself, taking on a battle stance.</p>
<p>When Li Xuan charged over, the Life Soul carapace had already enveloped his body. At the same time, he swung his fist.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen dodged Li Xuan’s fist and chopped at the back of his neck.</p>
<p>Li Xuan strangely circled around with his movement technique. Not only did he dodge Zhou Wen’s chop, but he also stabbed at Zhou Wen’s waist like a sharp blade.</p>
<p>“What’s with your movement technique?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>When Li Xuan was injured, he could quickly learn the other party’s skills and moves, but he couldn’t learn movement techniques.</p>
<p>As movement techniques couldn’t hurt him, Li Xuan’s movement technique had always been his weakness.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan’s movement technique had clearly improved significantly. Furthermore, it looked rather strange and fast.</p>
<p>“Hehe, this is the Dugu family’s movement technique. It originally wasn’t taught to outsiders, but my talent is too great and my character is excellent. They made an exception and I got to learn it from the Dugu family…” Li Xuan said smugly.</p>
<p>“Then let me see how much you have learned.” Zhou Wen became serious as he pushed the Defy Ancient Sovereign’s strength to its limits.</p>
<h3 id='chapter893'>Chapter 893: Battle for Advancement</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Gu Dian, Feng Qiuyan, Sadie, Gulli, Fang Ruoxi, and the other members of the Xuanwen Club watched the two of them fight from the side.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan watched for a while before his eyes lit up. “President has become much stronger after returning. Be it his movement techniques or skills, he has already reached the limits of a human. In addition, he can constantly recover and become stronger in battle. Coach might really be in trouble this time.”</p>
<p>Sadie nodded slightly. “What’s terrifying about Li Xuan is that he has countless chances of failure. As for others, if they make one mistake, they might never have another chance. This ability is really enviable.”</p>
<p>Gulli said enviously, “Why don’t I have such a sick Life Soul?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan kept fighting. Zhou Wen coupled Transcendent Flying Immortal with Defy Ancient Sovereign, but the pressure from the battle remained immense.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s movement technique was strange and inexplicable. It looked like he had inherited the Dugu family’s best teachings. Although he hadn’t reached the level of Transcendent Flying Immortal’s divine technique, he couldn’t be underestimated.</p>
<p>Most importantly, when Zhou Wen’s attack struck Li Xuan’s carapace, he could at best shatter it. It didn’t affect Li Xuan’s ability to continue the battle. Furthermore, after the carapace shattered, it would become even sturdier. It wouldn’t be easy for Zhou Wen to shatter it again.</p>
<p>Not only was the carapace becoming stronger, but Li Xuan was also constantly becoming stronger. His various techniques became more and more bizarre, and the changes became more and more unpredictable. Many stances didn’t look like something which were humanly possible.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that this was definitely a technique and skill that Li Xuan had learned from dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already pushed the Defy Ancient Sovereign’s strength to its limits. Transcendent Flying Immortal couldn’t be any faster, but he still couldn’t take down Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Li Xuan became more and more accustomed to the battle with Zhou Wen as he became stronger.</p>
<p>“Among his peers, the only one who can fight Coach to such an extent is probably President,” Feng Qiuyan said.</p>
<p>Sadie thought for a moment and said, “Perhaps some people might have the ability to determine the outcome of the battle with Coach in a short period of time, but there aren’t many people who can fight Coach head-on in such a manner.”</p>
<p>“Sis, do you think President has a chance of defeating Coach?” Gulli asked with interest.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to say. From the looks of it, Li Xuan is invincible. It’s not like there’s no chance,” Sadie said after some thought.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan also said, “Coach’s technique, abilities, and timing are undoubtedly top-notch. If it were an ordinary person, they would have long been defeated. However, President is the type of person who can’t be killed. Coach’s dominance will slowly decrease due to the expenditure of stamina and Essence Energy. As for President, as long as he doesn’t die, he will slowly become stronger. Time is on President’s side, so there’s indeed a chance unless Coach can defeat President in a short period of time.”</p>
<p>“Imagine the look on Coach’s face when he is defeated. That would definitely be interesting. I’m really looking forward to it,” Gulli said excitedly.</p>
<p>In fact, many people had such expectations. It wasn’t that Zhou Wen had a worse relationship with them compared to Li Xuan, but deep in the hearts of humans, they sympathized with the weak and hoped that the myth would be shattered.</p>
<p>In recent times, Zhou Wen was almost synonymous with invincibility. In comparison, Li Xuan was the person who could take down the legend.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was very serious. Although he gave off an indecent feeling, he was also someone who refused to admit defeat. Even if his opponent was Zhou Wen, he didn’t wish to lose.</p>
<p>In the crazy battle, the Defy Ancient Sovereign gave Zhou Wen endless energy, virtually making him a tireless machine. However, his suppression of Li Xuan continued to decrease.</p>
<p>Li Xuan became more and more familiar with Zhou Wen’s various moves and techniques. Although Zhou Wen was also familiar with him, he lacked the ability to self-repair and become stronger the more injured he was.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>When the fists met, Zhou Wen’s strength, which could originally suppress Li Xuan, now resulted in Zhou Wen taking two steps back uncontrollably. As for Li Xuan, his body only swayed.</p>
<p>“President has gained the upper hand,” Gulli said.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, the situation has begun to reverse.” Sadie looked seriously at Li Xuan.</p>
<p>In the beginning, she didn’t have a good impression of Li Xuan. She felt that Li Xuan was a typical foppish scion, but as she constantly interacted with him, Sadie’s impression of him had changed drastically.</p>
<p>At this point, Sadie had no choice but to admit that Li Xuan might be one of the top few people of their generation. Even the strongest Lance in the Ultimate Family Clan might not be able to defeat him.</p>
<p>Outside the six families, more and more young geniuses have appeared. Existences like Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, and Feng Qiuyan might be existences that can influence the fate of the Federation in the future… I have to work harder… Sadie carefully watched the battle between the two.</p>
<p>At that instant, Li Xuan switched from defense to offense and launched a barrage of attacks.</p>
<p>Previously, Li Xuan defended more than he attacked, but now, he wasn’t defending at all. He was completely devoted to attacking.</p>
<p>Every part of his body seemed to turn into a lethal weapon. Many of his offensive means were unimaginable to others, but Li Xuan used them without any trouble.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was finally suppressed. His Strength, Speed, and Constitution began to decline. Although it wasn’t obvious, it was exactly what was happening. As for Li Xuan, he was still growing stronger.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had many means to turn the situation around, but that required switching to other Essence Energy Arts. Zhou Wen had no intention of doing so. He continued using the Defy Ancient Sovereign to fight Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Bam! Bam!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body began to be struck. This was the first time he had been struck since the beginning of the battle.</p>
<p>Once there was a first, there was a second and third time. Zhou Wen felt the pain from his body, but his mood wasn’t that bad. Instead, he became more and more excited.</p>
<p>That’s it… Deliver something more violent… Zhou Wen felt the power fluctuations of the Defy Ancient Sovereign in his body as he attempted to control and drive the power fluctuations.</p>
<p>Badump! Badump!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart beat crazily, like a piston that was going all out.</p>
<p>However, this wasn’t enough. Zhou Wen guided the infinite vital essence produced by the Defy Ancient Sovereign to constantly compress the explosive force.</p>
<p>The Defy Ancient Sovereign could only produce powerful vitality, but it couldn’t be used in a virtuous cycle. What Zhou Wen needed to do now was mimic Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s circulation chain, constantly compressing and burning his vital force in his body instead of radiating it.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt his heart heat up as though it was about to ignite. At the same time, he could sense that the Defy Ancient Sovereign was transforming.</p>
<p>Come on, make the battle crazier. Zhou Wen also abandoned defending and dodging as he brandished his fist to meet Li Xuan’s crazy attacks.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter894'>Chapter 894: Ancient Sovereign Advancement</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Bam! Bam!</p>
<p>The clash of fists and flesh, the clash of blood and fire.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan seemed to be nailed to the ground. Their legs didn’t move, but their arms flailed wildly as they punched each other’s faces and chests.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan, Sadie, and company felt their hearts turn cold. This wasn’t a battle, but a life-and-death battle. Those who didn’t know better would think that Zhou Wen and Li Xuan had a deep grudge.</p>
<p>“Coach seems to be using his weakness to fight President’s advantage. Why is he doing this?” Feng Qiuyan frowned in thought.</p>
<p>Sadie said, “He probably wants to take a final gamble, right? His stamina and strength are declining. If he were to fight under normal circumstances, he would have to admit defeat after his stamina and strength drop drastically. Therefore, he needs to make the final impact before that happens, in a bid to reverse the situation.”</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan shook his head and said, “That’s not right. There’s no chance of turning the situation around with such a desperate attempt. Coach wouldn’t make such a foolish decision. He definitely has his reasons.”</p>
<p>“His injuries are getting worse, but Li Xuan’s injuries have automatically healed. Furthermore, such injuries will only make Li Xuan’s Life Soul carapace stronger. I really can’t tell what other chances Coach has. He can only reverse the situation by using external forces like Companion Beasts.” Sadie had the Eye of Odin’s ability to see the situation clearly.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen’s body was powerful, his injuries weren’t light after suffering so many blows. However, he still had no intention of retreating as he continued attacking Li Xuan crazily.</p>
<p>Just a little more… Why can’t I advance yet… What’s the difference… Zhou Wen could clearly sense that the Defy Ancient Sovereign in his body was like a volcano that was about to erupt due to the accumulation of the excess vital essence. However, for some reason, the energy just didn’t erupt which prevented the Defy Ancient Sovereign from completing its final evolution.</p>
<p>Why? What went wrong? The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General can constantly accumulate and burn using killing intent and flames, making him constantly become stronger. Why can’t the accumulation of vital essence push the Defy Ancient Sovereign to evolve? What’s the difference? As Zhou Wen fought, he thought hard.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Cracks appeared on Zhou Wen’s ribs as blood seeped out of the corner of his mouth. Even his organs began to rupture as fine cracks appeared. Blood was seeping out.</p>
<p>“Think of a way to make them stop. If this continues, Zhou Wen’s body won’t be able to withstand it.” Sadie could tell that Zhou Wen’s injuries were already rather serious. If this continued, it would be troublesome if his organs shattered.</p>
<p>“They can’t be serious, right? At such a time, President should be the one stopping, right? Could it be that President is really angry?” Gulli said.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan shook his head and said, “Impossible. President isn’t that kind of person. There must be a reason for not stopping.”</p>
<p>“His opponent is already so injured, but he still isn’t stopping. I really can’t think of a reason,” Gulli said.</p>
<p>“Pressure,” Gu Dian, who usually didn’t speak much, suddenly said.</p>
<p>“What?” Sadie and company didn’t hear Gu Dian clearly.</p>
<p>“Pressure,” Gu Dian repeated, but he had no intention of explaining.</p>
<p>This time, Sadie and Gulli heard it clearly, but they didn’t understand what Gu Dian meant.</p>
<p>“I understand. That’s right. It’s pressure…” Feng Qiuyan’s eyes lit up as he said in appreciation.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Gulli asked Feng Qiuyan in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan looked at Zhou Wen in battle and said, “Coach wants to break through. He wants to fight President using his weakness. That’s because he wants to surpass himself. He wants to make up for his flaws and become stronger. He wants to break through his shackles under pressure… President clearly understands this, so he’s trying his best to exert pressure on Coach…”</p>
<p>“Is that so? But from the looks of it, Coach will be beaten to death if this continues…” Gulli looked at Zhou Wen in disbelief.</p>
<p>Sadie also found it difficult to accept Feng Qiuyan’s explanation. Everyone had their own traits and weaknesses. No one could be perfect. To forcefully use their weakness to fight, could one really break through under heavy pressure? Sadie had great doubts about this.</p>
<p>“Coach should be able to do it,” Feng Qiuyan said matter-of-factly while he was inwardly considering: What’s my weakness? Should I try to break through my weakness?</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen knew what Feng Qiuyan was thinking, he would definitely be at a loss whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>He only wanted his Life Soul to advance to a Perfect Body. How could he think of any weakness to break through? With that time, he might as well farm more powerful Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t a perfectionist, nor had he ever thought of making himself perfect.</p>
<p>Why isn’t it working… What’s wrong? Zhou Wen clearly felt that the Defy Ancient Sovereign’s vital essence was about to erupt, but it just didn’t do so.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully thought through the similarities and differences between the Defy Ancient Sovereign and the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General and constantly compared the differences between the two.</p>
<p>Suddenly, an idea flashed in Zhou Wen’s mind. Yes, I’m lacking a catalyst. The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General uses flames to ignite killing intent to use it to burn Fiend Armor. No matter how much vital essence the Defy Ancient Sovereign gathers, it lacks a catalyst to ignite the vital essence, so it’s unable to convert it into an effective energy to push the Defy Ancient Sovereign to evolve… A catalyst… What do I use as a catalyst… to ignite the Defy Ancient Sovereign’s vital essence?</p>
<p>Although the Ancient Sovereign Sutra was inclined towards the fire element, it was in essence not the power of fire, but the fire of life. It was still somewhat different from pure fire-elemental powers.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the fire of life wasn’t enough to act as a catalyst. It could even be said that the heat wasn’t strong enough.</p>
<p>The Defy Ancient Sovereign… Ancient Sovereign Sutra… Ancient Sovereign… Zhou Wen suddenly recalled that The Thearch had once mentioned that the Ancient Sovereign Sutra was an Essence Energy Art of the Human Sovereign. It was an Essence Energy Art that was impossible to advance to the Mythical stage because there was no path ahead for humans. Even the head of the Three Sovereigns, Suirenshi, was unable to defy the heavens and change his fate of making the Ancient Sovereign Sutra break through to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Defy… So that’s how it is… If I don’t have the determination to defy the heavens and change my fate… How can I fight against the heavens… The Defy Ancient Sovereign Life Soul in Zhou Wen’s body emitted a glow like the sun, making the glow on Zhou Wen’s body grow stronger.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The light suddenly converged, and shortly after it converged, it quickly exploded. The terrifying light instantly devoured the entire training grounds, temporarily blinding everyone’s eyes.</p>
<h3 id='chapter895'>Chapter 895: Primordial Human Sovereign</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>Only one’s life can ignite vital essence. Zhou Wen already understood the true meaning of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. He forcefully used his life force as a catalyst to detonate the boundless vital life essence which Defy Ancient Sovereign had gathered.</p>
<p>As his vital essence erupted, the Defy Ancient Sovereign rapidly transformed and was instantly pushed to a Perfect Body.</p>
<p>The Defy Ancient Sovereign’s Perfect Body fused at a deeper level with Zhou Wen’s body. The effects on his body were even more direct and intense.</p>
<p>Primordial Human Sovereign? Zhou Wen had already sensed the information gained from the new Life Soul and knew its name.</p>
<p>Badump! Badump!</p>
<p>The beating of his heart combined with the power of the Primordial Human Sovereign. His heart was like a sun that emitted infinite light and heat. The light and heat made Zhou Wen’s entire body seem to burn. Every inch of his cells was filled with intense vital essence, like a humanoid sun of vital essence.</p>
<p>Even Feng Qiuyan and company, who were by the side of the arena, could sense the intense vitality emitted by Zhou Wen after he burned his vital essence. When the light of life shone on them, not only did it not make them feel uncomfortable, but it also gave them an indescribable sense of comfort. It was as though their bodies had been rejuvenated. All their fatigue and discomfort were swept away.</p>
<p>Even Li Xuan’s injuries that had yet to fully recover began to rapidly recover under the illumination of Zhou Wen’s humanoid sun.</p>
<p>The only injury that hadn’t recovered was Zhou Wen’s own injuries.</p>
<p>The Human Sovereign defied the heavens and killed, forging a way out for humans. However, he burned his own life in exchange for that.</p>
<p>Suirenshi observed lightning and obtained fire. Shennongshi tasted every plant. Fuxi deduced the changes in the world. All of them used their own strength to fight for a chance of survival.</p>
<p>And this chance of survival wasn’t for themselves.</p>
<p>Looking at Zhou Wen who was emitting light and heat like the sun, Li Xuan looked at him and said, “It’s fair now. Everyone has a Perfect Body Life Soul. No one will suffer a loss. Fight with all your might. Let me see how strong you are.”</p>
<p>“As you wish.” Zhou Wen’s body lit up as though he had turned into a burning body of energy. His fist broke through the speed of sound and blasted at Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Nicely done.” Li Xuan wasn’t to be outdone. The black demonic aura on the carapace expanded as he similarly brandished his fist at Zhou Wen like an evil god.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>At the instant the two fists collided, Li Xuan’s body was sent flying by Zhou Wen’s terrifying strength. Even the carapace on his fist shattered.</p>
<p>While Li Xuan’s body was still in the air, Zhou Wen had already followed up like a beam of light. He punched Li Xuan repeatedly with his fists.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s carapace shattered piece by piece. Without waiting for his carapace to heal, Zhou Wen’s fist had already struck his flesh.</p>
<p>The maximum power unleashed with Primordial Human Sovereign seemed to explode with life. It exceeded its original limits. Even something as powerful as Li Xuan’s carapace found it difficult to withstand it.</p>
<p>“What powerful strength, but your strength is still insufficient to kill me. Such an injury will only make me stronger faster.” Li Xuan wasn’t alarmed by Zhou Wen’s continuous attacks. Instead, he was delighted.</p>
<p>“Is that so?” Zhou Wen remained unperturbed. The power of the Primordial Human Sovereign constantly erupted, shattering Li Xuan’s bones.</p>
<p>“It’s useless… It’s useless… It’s useless… Although this kind of power is strong… it still can’t deal fatal damage to me… It will only make me stronger and stronger… Let the tempest come strike harder…” Li Xuan was in pain and happy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as his fists rained down on Li Xuan, nearly shattering his entire carapace. While the carapace rapidly healed, he also broke many of Li Xuan’s bones.</p>
<p>Finally, Zhou Wen punched Li Xuan in the abdomen, sending him flying.</p>
<p>However, while Li Xuan’s body was flying, his bones and carapace completely healed. When he landed on the ground, there were no wounds on his body. Even the carapace had completely recovered.</p>
<p>“Haha, didn’t I say so? Your attacks are useless against me. I feel that I’ve become stronger. My healing factor has sped up. It’s so fast that even I’m surprised. I really have to thank you… Strange… Why do I feel a little dizzy…” Li Xuan wanted to rub his eyes with his hand, but when he extended his left hand, he realized that his left hand couldn’t reach his face. He couldn’t help but feel strange. “What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“President… Your… Your body…” Gulli pointed at Li Xuan’s body in horror.</p>
<p>The others beside him had similar expressions as they looked at Li Xuan in horror as though they had seen a ghost.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with my body?” Li Xuan looked down at his body and when he saw it, he screamed in fright.</p>
<p>He wasn’t injured at all, but all his bones were not in their right positions. His leg bones were overturned, and his arm was twisted like a fried dough twist. His eyes were askew from each other, and his neck was slanted. Li Xuan could almost see his back with one of his eyes.</p>
<p>Now, Li Xuan looked like a deformed monster. Although he wasn’t injured and his carapace was intact, there was nothing right with his body.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, Old Zhou, what did you do to me?” Li Xuan was frightened as he asked with a trembling voice.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. I just broke your bones and made them heal faster,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, you are screwing with me. Quickly fix me…” Li Xuan felt like crying.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s self-healing had a memory characteristic that allowed him to recover to his normal state. However, Zhou Wen’s Power of the Primordial Human Sovereign also had the ability to heal others.</p>
<p>Therefore, Li Xuan’s fractured bones were healed before they returned to normal. This resulted in such a deformity.</p>
<p>“Then I must break your bones again,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Quick… Quick beat me…” Li Xuan said through gritted teeth. All he wanted now was to quickly recover his handsome appearance.</p>
<p>“You are the one asking for the beating. Don’t you retaliate,” Zhou Wen said as he walked in front of Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Absolutely not.” Li Xuan gritted his teeth so hard that they nearly shattered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen once again unleashed the power of Primordial Human Sovereign, but this time, shattering Li Xuan’s bones was much more difficult than the last time. His carapace and bones had become harder, and his healing factor had improved.</p>
<p>It wasn’t easy for him to break all the deformed bones again, allowing them to return to their normal states and heal themselves. Eventually, Li Xuan finally returned to normal.</p>
<p>Li Xuan, who had returned to normal, wanted to sneak an attack on Zhou Wen, but Zhou Wen nimbly dodged.</p>
<p>“If you do that again, I won’t help you recover next time,” Zhou Wen took a few steps back and said to Li Xuan with a smile.</p>
<p>When Li Xuan thought of his appearance, he couldn’t help but shiver. Although he wasn’t afraid of being injured, he couldn’t tolerate such a deformed look.</p>
<p>“F*ck, what kind of f*cking Life Soul is that? It’s freaking sinister.” Li Xuan didn’t dare attack again as he cursed indignantly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter896'>Chapter 896: Essence Energy Pill</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>After Zhou Wen returned, he carefully studied the Primordial Human Sovereign’s powers and realized that it was indeed very powerful. It was expected of a Life Soul condensed from an Essence Energy Art with the Strength attribute.</p>
<p>After the Perfect Body’s Perfect Body Human Sovereign fused with Zhou Wen, the strength it could produce was almost comparable to a weaker Mythical creature.</p>
<p>What was ridiculous was that this power came from the explosion of powerful vital essence. In other words, after the power of the Primordial Human Sovereign produced destructive power, the power of the burning vital essence would also heal the destroyed lifeforms.</p>
<p>Therefore, after Zhou Wen injured someone, he would automatically treat their injuries. Apart from causing them some pain, it was basically useless.</p>
<p>What the hell is this? It wasn’t easy for me to have a powerful destructive Essence Energy Art and Life Soul, but this is what I get!? Zhou Wen didn’t know if he should be happy or worried.</p>
<p>He never expected that the Essence Energy Art that represented Strength would form a Life Soul ability that healed. What was even worse was that this healing ability was useless for him.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I can only place my hopes on another Strength-attribute Essence Energy Art. Zhou Wen could only hope that another Strength-attribute Essence Energy Art could bring him pure destructive power.</p>
<p>Regardless, the Ancient Sovereign Life Soul had finally advanced to a Perfect Body. He was one step closer to advancing to the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>Now, I still need to cultivate Glimmer, Civilized Country, the Demon God Catalog, and that unknown Essence Energy Art. Zhou Wen thought to himself as to which Essence Energy Art he should focus on.</p>
<p>Glimmer needs me to walk out to advance. Civilized Country requires teleportation. These two aren’t things that can’t be cultivated just because I want to. As the Demon God Catalog doesn’t have the corresponding Guardian’s blood, it can’t condense a Life Soul. I can’t cultivate it now either. Now, I can only cultivate that unknown Essence Energy Art. After Zhou Wen thought it through, he began studying the Essence Energy Art.</p>
<p>The Essence Energy Art was learned from the entrance of the Founding Emperor Tomb. Now, Zhou Wen didn’t know what its stats were. If it was Strength, it would correspond to the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. Then, all the Essence Energy Arts would be considered complete.</p>
<p>However, he couldn’t be certain yet. All he could do was cultivate it first. Once he condensed a Life Providence, he would probably be able to make a judgment.</p>
<p>This Essence Energy Art was very strange. It solely extracted and compressed Essence Energy. Every circulation would purify some of the Essence Energy and increase its concentration. Apart from that, it was useless.</p>
<p>Could it be that as long as this Essence Energy Art purifies the Essence Energy to a certain extent, it can automatically evolve a Life Providence? Zhou Wen studied it and felt that it seemed to be the only possibility.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen obtained some high-level Essence Energy Crystals in-game. As he absorbed them, he practiced his Essence Energy Art.</p>
<p>This method actually worked. With the help of a large number of high-level Essence Energy Crystals, it was very easy to cultivate the Essence Energy Art. The Essence Energy in Zhou Wen’s body also became purer.</p>
<p>This thing seems to be specially used for Qi Refinement. Could it be an Essence Energy Art with an Essence Energy attribute? If that’s the case, I can only find another Essence Energy Art that corresponds to Strength or Constitution. The more Zhou Wen looked at the Essence Energy Art, the more it resembled an Essence Energy attribute.</p>
<p>In just a few days, the nameless Essence Energy Art automatically produced a Life Providence.</p>
<p>Life Providence: Qi Refinement Cultivator</p>
<p>After the Life Providence appeared, Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy recovery and Essence Energy purity were greatly augmented. This chilled Zhou Wen’s heart.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, this Essence Energy Art is most likely of the Essence Energy attribute. Zhou Wen thought for a moment. Since he had already condensed a Life Providence, he might as well condense a Life Soul to see if it was of any use.</p>
<p>The Guardian’s blood that corresponded to Essence Energy wasn’t difficult to obtain. Zhou Wen went to Ant City and obtained a drop of it.</p>
<p>What surprised Zhou Wen was that the Essence Energy Art that Zhou Wen called Qi Refinement Art didn’t absorb the blood essence of the Ant City Guardian.</p>
<p>It’s not an Essence Energy attribute? Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as hope rose in his heart.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen went to the underground sea again and obtained a drop of the Guardian’s blood essence. He attempted to use the Qi Refinement Art to absorb it.</p>
<p>With the Qi Refinement Art activated, the drop of blood was sucked in. Zhou Wen immediately felt his Essence Energy begin to condense towards the drop of blood. His essence, vitality, and spirit also stirred as he vaguely showed signs of condensing a Life Soul.</p>
<p>The Guardian of the underground sea seems to have a spatial attribute. Then what’s his corresponding basic attribute? Will it be Strength? Zhou Wen was somewhat nervous.</p>
<p>This was because he had already confirmed that the Qi Refinement Art wasn’t of the Essence Energy attribute. As for the Guardian of the underground sea, its attributes had nothing to do with Speed. Zhou Wen had already confirmed that the most likely possibility was Strength or Constitution.</p>
<p>The Demon God Catalog couldn’t condense a Life Soul with the blood of the underground sea Guardian. Furthermore, it was very likely to have a Constitution attribute, so the Qi Refinement Art was likely of the Strength attribute.</p>
<p>As his essence, vitality, and spirit condensed, the Essence Energy in Zhou Wen’s body that had been purified and refined by the Qi Refinement Art quickly gathered together, gradually forming a core that was purely formed from Essence Energy.</p>
<p>It was still constantly purifying. The Essence Energy in the pill became more and more condensed, turning from gaseous to liquid before turning from liquid to solid.</p>
<p>The form of this Life Soul looks a little similar to the Primordial Life Soul of the Dao Art. Is it really not of the Essence Energy attribute? Zhou Wen was rather suspicious.</p>
<p>However, the two were still somewhat different. The Life Soul of the Dao Sutra was born in the Sea of Consciousness, while the Life Soul of the Qi Refinement Art was born in the Essence Energy Sea. The two were different.</p>
<p>Finally, when the pill was crystalline and almost without any impurities, the Life Soul condensed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already sensed some of its information, but he habitually checked its information with his phone.</p>
<p>Life Soul: Essence Energy Pill (Primordial Body)</p>
<p>Is this something like a pill? Zhou Wen could sense the terrifying Essence Energy in the Essence Energy Pill, but such Essence Energy seemed a little too domineering. It was different from things like the Rejuvenation Pill.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his hand and beckoned. The resplendent diamond-like Essence Energy Pill appeared on his fingertip. With a thought, he controlled the Essence Energy Pill to fly into the air. It was very fast, but he didn’t discover any special abilities.</p>
<p>Could it be that I’m to use this Essence Energy Pill to smash others? Zhou Wen randomly entered a dungeon and came to the Metalwork Temple. When he saw a Metal Golem with a hammer approaching, he ordered the Essence Energy Pill to rush over.</p>
<p>The Essence Energy Pill transformed into a stream of light that penetrated the Metal Golem’s head. The Metal Golem immediately died as the system produced a notice of its death.</p>
<p>This thing is really used for smashing others! Zhou Wen was greatly surprised as he found some Epic dimensional creatures to test with his Essence Energy Pill.</p>
<p>The Essence Energy Pill easily penetrated the bodies of Epic creatures. Even the Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior’s Runic Heavy Armor failed to block it. The shimmering heavy armor was forcefully penetrated and he was stabbed in the chest.</p>
<h3 id='chapter897'>Chapter 897: Possibility</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>I never expected the destructive power of a tiny Essence Energy Pill to be so powerful. If I can advance it to a Perfect Body, its destructive power should be comparable to a relatively low-level Mythical weapon, right? Zhou Wen was somewhat delighted.</p>
<p>His Life Soul didn’t have a pure destructive Life Soul. The downside was that the Life Soul was only a pellet and couldn’t be used as a weapon.</p>
<p>How can I advance the Essence Energy Pill to a Perfect Body? Should I continue absorbing Essence Energy? Zhou Wen attempted to continue absorbing the Essence Energy in the Essence Energy Crystals, and it turned out to be useful.</p>
<p>The Qi Refinement Art is really unique. As long as I have enough Essence Energy, I can resolve all problems. Such an Essence Energy Art can be quickly mastered as long as I have the resources. It’s very suitable to be popularized among humans. Zhou Wen was still thinking of promoting Essence Energy Arts in the future.</p>
<p>The Essence Energy Pill can slowly absorb Essence Energy. Glimmer requires me to walk outside. The advancement of these two Life Souls only requires time. However, the Civilized Country and the Demon God Catalog are somewhat troublesome. Civilized Country needs a large number of teleportations. I have to think of a way to get a pet that can teleport. The Demon God Catalog needs the blood of a Guardian. From the looks of it, I must think of a solution using The Thearch. Zhou Wen thought about how he could obtain The Thearch’s blood essence.</p>
<p>The Thearch wants me to meet her at Chess Mountain. This is a chance. Perhaps I can settle that alchemist when I obtain the blood essence. Zhou Wen thought of all sorts of possibilities.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was no news of the alchemist. He didn’t know if the alchemist had given up on pursuing him.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, haven’t you been searching for Companion Beasts that can teleport?” An Sheng called with good news.</p>
<p>“There’s news?” Zhou Wen was delighted.</p>
<p>“It’s not easy to find such a Companion Beast. However, recently, a break-out creature that’s suspected to be able to teleport has appeared on the eastern coast. If you are interested, you can try your luck. You can also do me a favor as a result,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>An Sheng roughly explained the situation. Due to the appearance of the break-out creature, the nearby cities suffered heavy losses. A local wealthy family there had business dealings with the An family.</p>
<p>The An family’s Essence Energy compression accelerator required an important supplementary material. It was mainly provided by that family.</p>
<p>They were now asking the An family for help. If the An family could help them eliminate the break-out creature, not only would they obtain the materials at low prices, but the family would also prioritize providing them the materials in the future.</p>
<p>There were very few materials produced. Many places in the Federation needed them. The An family wasn’t the only family that was willing to help them eliminate the break-out creatures. However, no one had succeeded so far.</p>
<p>The main reason was that the break-out creature had a powerful spatial ability. It could teleport continuously and it was very difficult to trap it. Even if one had the ability to kill it, they wouldn’t be able to catch up to it.</p>
<p>An Sheng then transmitted the detailed information about the break-out creature to Zhou Wen. In the video he received, Zhou Wen discovered that it was a dimensional creature that looked a little like a Qilin. Its body was as colorful as colored glass, and it ran extremely fast. Furthermore, it could instantly vanish. It would then appear elsewhere. It was undoubtedly a spatial teleportation ability.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully studied the video. As the break-out creature was too fast, even high-speed cameras couldn’t capture a complete image. If he slowed down the video, there would be some missing parts.</p>
<p>However, from the video, it could be seen that the break-out creature’s combat strength was very strong. Apart from its spatial teleportation abilities, its physical combat strength was also tremendous. It also had powerful single-target and group-target Essence Energy Skills. It was a very comprehensive Mythical creature with almost no obvious weaknesses.</p>
<p>In terms of combat strength, Tyrant Behemoth is definitely not inferior to it. The main point is that its spatial teleportation ability is too powerful. It won’t be easy to kill it. Zhou Wen was already tempted. If not for such powerful spatial teleportation abilities, it wouldn’t be worth him taking the risk.</p>
<p>However, before the problem of the alchemist was resolved, Zhou Wen was afraid that the alchemist would find him after he left Luoyang. When that happened, it wouldn’t be easy for him to run to Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>“I’m very interested in that break-out creature, but I’m afraid I won’t be able to go over before resolving the alchemist problem,” Zhou Wen said to An Sheng.</p>
<p>“There’s no rush. No one can deal with that break-out creature yet. There’s still a chance if you go later.” An Sheng paused before continuing, “We can’t wait for the alchemist to come. Why don’t we think of a way to lure him over?”</p>
<p>“How? Don’t tell me you want to use me as bait?” Zhou Wen immediately guessed An Sheng’s intentions.</p>
<p>An Sheng said, “According to what you said, the banana fan in the Sun True Flames Furnace has already been absorbed by your Companion Beast. It’s useless even if that alchemist kills you, but he is still stubbornly chasing after you. There should be another reason for this. Think about it carefully and you should be able to come up with something. Perhaps we can use this point to lure him over and let him have a taste of the Essence Energy compression accelerator.”</p>
<p>“Forget it. Your accelerators require too much preparation time. Energy is also a problem.” Zhou Wen rejected An Sheng’s good intentions.</p>
<p>However, An Sheng’s suggestion gave Zhou Wen some inspiration.</p>
<p>It wasn’t reliable to rely on the An family’s accelerator to eliminate the alchemist, but it was a good way to lure him to Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for the sun banana fan, why would the alchemist chase after me? Zhou Wen thought of the purple bronze ball that Liu Yun had given him before he left, as well as the things he had taken from the stone house.</p>
<p>It should be these things, right? After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that there was only one possibility. Apart from that, he didn’t take anything out of the Founding Emperor Tomb.</p>
<p>I can give it a try. Zhou Wen didn’t know if these things could lure the alchemist over, but he could give it a try. After all, he could only wait.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen decided to take the purple bronze ball and pill-related items to Chess Mountain to see if he could lure the alchemist over.</p>
<p>Xu Ai hadn’t been in a good mood the past few days. She had come to the An family mainly because she wanted to obtain information on the An family’s Essence Energy weapons. However, after arriving, she had only seen An Tianzuo once. She didn’t even have the chance to speak to him, much less go to the An family’s weapon factory.</p>
<p>“Miss, I’ve found out that the An family values the material—Magic Dust. As for the Lu family, which mainly produces Magic Dust, they have been seeking help everywhere recently because of a break-out creature. Furthermore, the Lu family is willing to use large amounts of Magic Dust as payment. At the same time, they are also willing to provide Magic Dust’s priority purchase rights. If we can obtain these rights, the An family will likely take the initiative to cooperate with us.” The female guard sent the news to Xu Ai.</p>
<h3 id='chapter898'>Chapter 898: Purple Bronze Ball</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“It’s not convenient for us to appear, right?” Xu Ai frowned.</p>
<p>“Our family has already found someone to step in. However, we still need you to personally deal with that break-out creature. No one else can do it,” the female guard said.</p>
<p>“There’s no progress here. It’s not appropriate for me to stay in the An family for too long. I don’t want them to notice anything. It’s good to go out for a walk,” Xu Ai said after some thought.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took Ya’er to Chess Mountain. He didn’t head to the encampment but took a detour to somewhere around Chess Mountain and found a hidden spot.</p>
<p>I wonder if this thing can lure that alchemist over. Zhou Wen took out the pill furnaces and pills, opened the lid, and placed them on the ground.</p>
<p>Then, he took out the purple bronze ball and injected Essence Energy into it.</p>
<p>After the purple bronze ball absorbed the Essence Energy, it began to light up. Soon, it was like a red-hot metal ball.</p>
<p>The copper ball itself seemed to be fire-elemental. As long as Essence Energy was injected into it, the copper ball would produce heat, but that was all. It didn’t have any special use.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already experimented many times in the past. Now that he thought about it, it was very likely that the alchemist was able to find him because of the copper ball. It was as though the alchemist had come knocking on his door not long after he had taken it out to experiment.</p>
<p>Sitting on the ground, Zhou Wen constantly injected Essence Energy into the copper ball to maintain its burning state.</p>
<p>Essence Energy was nothing to Zhou Wen. It was nearly inexhaustible in his Slaughterer state.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t know if the alchemist would be attracted or when he would arrive, Zhou Wen was still prepared to escape at any time.</p>
<p>Earth Elemental Beast and Truth Listener were already on standby. Zhou Wen sent Explosive Fiend Man out and set up a large number of time bombs nearby.</p>
<p>In some hidden places, Zhou Wen even set up many Gu Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>He had farmed quite a number of Gu in the Valley of No Return, so it came in handy. He even threw many Ancient Tadpoles into the riverbed of Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>He didn’t need to kill the alchemist. All he needed to do was stall him or discover him in advance.</p>
<p>Eh, what’s this? Zhou Wen suddenly realized that something strange had happened to the purple bronze ball.</p>
<p>Due to the prolonged infusion of Essence Energy to keep it burning, the entire purple bronze ball had turned golden. And in the golden color, there was a hint of purple flowing.</p>
<p>The purple color was like smoke and also light as it constantly flowed in the purple bronze ball. Furthermore, its flow was very regular.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at it for a while and increasingly felt that the purple color was very strange. It seemed to have a life of its own. Wherever it flowed, the Essence Energy would vanish, causing the originally golden copper ball to cool down significantly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen attempted to inject more Essence Energy, but the outcome was the same. No matter how much Essence Energy Zhou Wen injected, the purple swath would absorb most of it, allowing the purple bronze ball to maintain a temperature that wasn’t too high or too low.</p>
<p>Could it be that the purple color is also a dimensional creature? Or could it be that this purple bronze ball is a dimensional creature? Zhou Wen wasn’t sure. After observing for a while, he saw that the purple color was only swimming in the purple bronze ball. Furthermore, it was extremely regular. It didn’t seem like it would rush out.</p>
<p>What’s the use of the purple bronze ball? Is it part of the Sun True Flames Furnace? Zhou Wen was puzzled. He wanted to ask Liu Yun, but unfortunately, he didn’t know where Liu Yun was.</p>
<p>Liu Yun said that there were two purple bronze balls. If I can find him, I might be able to figure out what use this thing has. Zhou Wen observed for a while and seeing no special reaction, he stopped paying attention.</p>
<p>He had more or less set up his traps. Zhou Wen got Truth Listener to pay close attention to his surroundings. The Earth Elemental Beast was beneath him, allowing him to escape at any time.</p>
<p>Holding his phone, he continued grinding.</p>
<p>Ya’er held the phone Zhou Wen had bought for her and was learning human language and words.</p>
<p>“Ah… Oh… Uh… Y… Uh… Fish…” Ya’er studied diligently with the phone software. She wasn’t impatient.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Nothing happened for two days. Just as Zhou Wen thought that the purple bronze ball and pill furnace were useless, he suddenly felt his heart palpitate as he felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen picked up Ya’er and charged into the sky.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen leaped into the air, he saw the Earth Elemental Beast’s body bounce up from the ground as though it had been struck by lightning. Lightning crackled around its body as it emitted smoke.</p>
<p>Beneath the Earth Elemental Beast, the elderly alchemist tore out of the ground and stared coldly at Zhou Wen in midair. As though he had teleported, he grabbed at him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen unsummoned the injured Earth Elemental Beast immediately and turned the Civilized Country ring on his finger before rushing towards Chess Mountain’s mountain wall.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what had taken effect, but he couldn’t be bothered to consider it. When he teleported out, he was already above the riverbed of Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>The elderly alchemist ignored the pill furnaces and pills on the ground. With a flash, he vanished into the ground as though he was in pursuit.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself that no matter how powerful his Earth Escape was, it was impossible for him to directly come out of the water and fly towards Chess Mountain along the river.</p>
<p>To his surprise, the river below suddenly exploded with waves. The elderly alchemist’s figure condensed from the waves and grabbed at Zhou Wen again.</p>
<p>This fellow actually knows Water Escape… Could it be that he’s proficient in the Five-Elemental escape techniques? Zhou Wen hated encountering these fellows who were proficient in Dao techniques.</p>
<p>An Epic Elegant Emperor’s Avatar Puppet was already very difficult to deal with, but the elderly alchemist was much harder to deal with than that.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the elderly alchemist wasn’t powerful enough to interrupt teleportation. Zhou Wen teleported six times in a row and arrived near Chess Mountain’s mountain wall. He could already clearly see the flower on the mountain wall.</p>
<p>“The Thearch, save me.” Zhou Wen felt that it was best to be honest in front of The Thearch. If she refused to appear, it wouldn’t be too late to rush into Deer Terrace Pavilion.</p>
<p>However, the flower on the mountain wall didn’t react. As for the alchemist behind him, he had already caught up. All Zhou Wen could do was teleport again.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen had already arrived in front of the mountain wall when he teleported. However, the flower on the mountain wall remained motionless. Zhou Wen had no choice but to summon the Earth Elemental Beast. He planned on forcefully passing through the mountain wall and using Earth Escape to enter Deer Terrace Pavilion to lure the elderly alchemist to the Nine-Tailed Fox.</p>
<p>The elderly alchemist seemed to be somewhat afraid of Chess Mountain, but when he saw that nothing happened around him, he chased after Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>At that moment, the flower on the mountain wall suddenly raised its flower bud. A petal dropped and dissipated.</p>
<p>As the petal vanished, the elderly alchemist who was charging at Zhou Wen suddenly came to a halt. He was like a horse that was galloping at full speed only to be nailed to the spot. From motion to stillness, there was no buffer.</p>
<p>“Wish spell! Which race are you from? I’m Yin Talisman King of the Immortals. I didn’t mean to offend you,” said the elderly alchemist as he looked at the flower on the mountain wall in horror.</p>
<p>“Do you think you are worthy of calling yourself an Immortal? You are just a lowly rat.” The Thearch’s voice sounded from the flower.</p>

<p>“I am indeed an Immortal…” The elder who called himself the Yin Talisman King already had the intention of retreating. He slowly retreated and wanted to use escape techniques to leave, but he realized that they were completely useless.</p>
<p>“Take another step and you shall perish right here,” The Thearch said indifferently.</p>
<p>Yin Talisman King’s expression changed, but he didn’t dare move. He stood there and said with a bitter smile, “I have no grudge with you, nor did I mean to offend you…”</p>
<p>“Are you worthy of having a grudge with me?” The Thearch said indifferently, “Not to mention a thief like you, even the first Contractor, Yellow Emperor, wouldn’t dare call himself an Immortal, much less a thing like you.”</p>
<p>When Yin Talisman King heard that, fear flashed in his eyes. He hurriedly bowed and said, “Please forgive me, Great One. I inherited the legacy of Yellow Emperor and thought of myself as part of the Yellow Emperor’s lineage. I definitely didn’t dare be disrespectful to the Immortals…”</p>
<p>The Thearch said disdainfully, “You can’t even master the Yin Talisman Sutra and forcefully fused with a Guardian. If Yellow Emperor really has a successor like you, I’m afraid he will be so angry that he will kill himself. Slice off your own arm and scram. If you dare to touch one of mine in the future, there will be no place for you in the world—Heaven, Earth, or Hell.”</p>
<p>Yin Talisman King gritted his teeth and slashed off his left arm. Without looking at the arm that had landed on the ground, he bowed in the direction of the flower and quickly left.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was dumbfounded. He had originally planned on luring the Yin Talisman King here to let him engage in an internecine battle with The Thearch, but he never expected such an outcome.</p>
<p>Yin Talisman King, who already had the ability of Terror transformation, didn’t even dare resist. The Thearch only needed to say one sentence to make him slice off his arm.</p>
<p>The flower looked at Zhou Wen and said sinisterly, “Were you thinking of luring him to me so that he could fight me so that you could take advantage of the situation?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately shivered and hurriedly said, “Misunderstanding… It’s really a misunderstanding… I was driven into a corner by him, so I had no choice but to seek your help. I’m really indebted to you for saving my life. I have nothing to repay you with. I’ll go back and prepare some new research equipment for you…”</p>
<p>“Try taking another step,” The Thearch said coldly. “Do you think I really don’t know what you did at the river?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to stop and look at The Thearch. “Ahem, I just wanted to use your fame to scare him away. I never expected him to really dare come. By the way, The Thearch, why did you get me to come last time?”</p>
<p>“Who did you give that divine fruit to?” The Thearch asked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to summon Doctor Darkness and say, “I fed him the divine fruit. If I had known that you wanted it, I would have given it to you.”</p>
<p>“Cut the useless crap.” The Thearch sized up Doctor Darkness before saying to Zhou Wen, “I saved your life today and helped you defeat a powerful enemy. How are you going to repay me?”</p>
<p>“Feel free to instruct me. As long as I can do it, I’ll definitely do my best.” Zhou Wen didn’t have any room for negotiation.</p>
<p>“Use this Companion Beast of yours to help me do something. I won’t treat you unfairly. Don’t you want my blood essence? If you do it, I’ll give you a drop of blood essence,” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>“The matter you mentioned must be very dangerous, right?” Zhou Wen asked carefully.</p>
<p>“It depends. This Companion Beast of yours can barely be considered up to the mark. With him doing this, the difficulty shouldn’t be too high,” The Thearch answered casually.</p>
<p>“Can I know what you want me to do?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I want you to steal something from the dimension,” The Thearch said straightforwardly.</p>
<p>“Stealing? My eldest senior brother is especially good at stealing. Furthermore, he’s an expert with the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting. No one in this world can match him. Why don’t I introduce him to you?” Zhou Wen hurriedly said.</p>
<p>The Thearch smiled and said, “Only your Companion Beast can steal it unless there’s another Companion Beast that ate the divine fruit.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Once I tell you what it is, you have to go,” The Thearch said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Can’t I go now?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Of course not,” The Thearch said firmly.</p>
<p>“Then tell me. What do you want my Doctor Darkness to steal?” Zhou Wen asked the flower.</p>
<p>“I want you to help me steal a bell…” The Thearch pondered for a moment before saying.</p>
<p>“What kind of bell? Which dimensional zone?” Zhou Wen continued asking.</p>
<p>“It’s a bell the size of a fist. It’s made of bronze and looks like a small bell. There’s the ancient word ‘Shang’ engraved on it. When you look at it, you will naturally know that it’s it.” After a pause, The Thearch continued, “Didn’t I just say that the small bell is in the dimension, not a dimensional zone? Otherwise, there wouldn’t be a need for a Companion Beast that has eaten a divine fruit.”</p>
<p>“The place where I took the divine fruit?” Zhou Wen’s expression turned odd.</p>
<p>“Not far from there.” The Thearch nodded.</p>
<p>“I don’t have the ability to go there,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about that. Since I’m getting you to go, I naturally have a way to ensure your safe return. You just need to follow the plan and steal that bell back,” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and said, “I can give it a try, but I need some time to prepare. Besides, you have to give me the drop of blood essence first.”</p>
<p>“Sure. Make an oath and I’ll give it to you,” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that if he swore, it wouldn’t be as simple as empty words. There would definitely be some restrictions if he swore in front of The Thearch.</p>
<p>“Alright, I swear that if I can’t bring that bell back to you, I’ll be severely condemned by my conscience…” Zhou Wen raised his hand and swore solemnly at the flower.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A thunderclap suddenly sounded in the sky, giving Zhou Wen a fright.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally believed that he couldn’t bluff his way out of this oath, but to his surprise, The Thearch didn’t make him swear again. She said meaningfully, “Conscience is sometimes very important.”</p>
<p>With that said, a crystalline drop of water suddenly flew out from the flower’s stamen without waiting for Zhou Wen to say a word. It flew in front of Zhou Wen and floated in front of him.</p>
<p>“This is the blood essence you want. I’ll give you a month to prepare. Come here in a month and I’ll tell you the detailed plan,” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>Could it be that The Thearch’s true body is really this flower? Zhou Wen looked at the drop of blood essence in front of him and had his suspicions.</p>
<p>He extended his hand towards the water droplet and secretly circulated the Demon God Catalog. The moment Zhou Wen’s palm touched the water droplet, the water droplet seemed to be absorbed by a sponge. It seeped into his skin and was absorbed by the circulating Demon God Catalog.</p>
<p>I actually managed to match it! Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.</p>
